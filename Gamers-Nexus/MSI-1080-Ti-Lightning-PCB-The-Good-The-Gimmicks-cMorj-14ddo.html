going to be taking a look at the msi gtx
1080 TI lightning so this is MSI's sort
of competitor to the EVGA kingpin or the
Galax Holub same 1080 t eyes so this
thing is meant for extreme overclocking
for you know running on ln2 it's not I
don't think it's pushed as far as say
the kingpin in terms of actual ln2
specific feature set or even the
hall-of-fame I'd argue the hall-of-fame
problem actually has an even stronger
vrm than this but this is definitely the
highest end card that msi is making and
certainly not you know compared to most
1080 TI's it is quite a lot of PCV
compared to most of the other ones
before that this is brought to you by
EVGA s at CLC 280 liquid cooler 4 CPUs
which we previously benchmarked and
found to be a high performer given its
relative silence the temperature output
learn more about this $140 cooler at the
link in the description below so before
we get into the vrm however I'd like to
address one minor problem I have with
this card and that's these 3 8 pin power
connectors and the fact that they're
completely unnecessary there's just no
way on earth that a 1080 Ti even with
liquid nitrogen is going to pull 900
watts of power
well actually 972 watts of power and
some of you might be like wait a minute
how are you getting to that number
aren't these connectors rated for 150
watts well that's the ATX spec for these
yes their respect for 150 watt by the
PCIe and ATX stuff but the company that
actually makes these which is molex and
these are mini junior connectors from
molex these are rated for 9 amps per pin
pair so 3 is so each of these 8 pins has
3 12 volt lines three ground lines
there's two other lines in there which
don't actually transfer power they're
for detecting if you've logged in a 6
pin or an 8 pin or if you've even
plugged in a connector at all so there's
a bit of safety built into 2 or like the
2 of those pins are basically just
safety checks
they're not actually used for power
transmission but you do have three
grounds and 312 volts and that leaves
the power connector capable of
delivering 324 watts at 12 volts if you
have 18 gauge wiring coming from your
PSU because actually it's a limitation
of the 18 gauge wires that sets the
power look like the the maximum power
that these connectors can do because you
can get these connect like on a 16 gauge
wiring these will handle as high as 13
amps per pin pair so yeah but most power
supplies are 18 gauge wired so 324 watts
is the limit you'll usually that's like
workable for most applications because
power supplies with 16 gauge wiring are
pretty rare like I don't have one so and
I buy high in power supplies so I you
know if I got the card I'd still be
limited to that 324 watt figure so with
three of these the card can do 972 Watts
and it really really really doesn't need
to have that many power connectors I
mean even if it was only to eight pins
it would still have a 375 watt power
limit by ATX spec and that is still
pretty high for a 1080p ah'd like for
overclocking and such you'd be fine and
then if you raise the power limit beyond
that is still like the connectors not
going to complain you're just violating
the ATX pack which happens to be really
really really conservative about what
these connectors can and can't do
so basically this whole 3/8 pin thing it
doesn't actually do anything for the
overclocking capabilities of the card
it's a really easy marketing stunt to
make think people go whoa this card has
three eight pins it has to be great at
overclocking because it's got so many
power connectors which really just isn't
the case you're not even going to use
you know half the cape of power
capability of
the what like of two of these because
actually the card at stock the stock
Parliament on one of these is apparently
around 320 watts so on stock you're not
even going to use half of two of these
eight pins much less all three of them
so it's completely just a marketing
stunt it's not even remotely practical
for this card to have this many a pin
power connectors so I'm not really a fan
of that because it's it's just silly to
do this anyway let's get on to things
that are also kind of silly but I'd
argue us so because they're also kind of
Awesome like the 14 phase V core of erm
located right over here so we have 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 inductors and
then we have 14 power stages behind
those and we also have seven doublers
because you can't actually buy a
fourteen phase voltage controller you
can the max you can buy as an eight
phase-- so here you have this chip right
here which that is an international
rectifier ir35
95 that's an eight phase-- controller in
here it's running in seven phase mode
and support switching frequencies from
200 kilohertz up to 2 megahertz note
that you would actually run at that 2
megahertz frequency because that would
just send vrm efficiency down like vrm
power efficiency down the drain while
giving you absolutely no benefit in
terms of voltage stability or something
like that well it would but it wouldn't
be a measurable improvement it wouldn't
like it wouldn't improve overclocking
whatsoever so yeah it's not going to run
that high also the card doesn't actually
give you access to the switching
frequency of the voltage controller so
you can't change that anyway Emma sighs
probably shipping the card with 600
kilohertz coming out of the actual
voltage controller just because once
that goes through the doublers which are
international rectifier
I are $35.99 so these are doublers and
or quadruple errs they're really really
basically just cuts the signal like they
just take the 600 kilohertz signal and
split it in half so you get 300
kilohertz to your two phases hooked up
to one of those doublers which is normal
that's how all doublers work it does not
include any kind of fancy phase current
balancing features or anything like that
not that that is super necessary when
this vrm is never really going to have
any significant amount of current going
through any one of the phases just
because of the ridiculous phase count
that MSI is running here so you know I
don't have any complaints for the
control scheme and I'm assuming that 600
kilohertz to 300 600 kilohertz and 300
kilohertz actual phase frequency because
the International rectifier power stages
that MSI is using are optimized to run
best at 300 kilohertz they're
specifically designed to get best
efficiency at around 300 kilohertz you
can get a little bit more if you go
below that but it's not like it's not
worth the trade-off whereas going above
that sends and sends the efficients you
really really like the efficiency gets
really bad really quick if you go beyond
300 kilohertz and you don't really get
any major benefits either so I'm going
to assume that the code runs among 300
kilohertz and the power stage is in
question or international rectifier ir35
55 so these are 60 amp power stages
these are not the best 60 amp power
stages that international rectifier
makes the best ones would be the IR 35
75 s which also come with a partial
metal casing which basically improves
heat dissipation from the MOSFETs and
lowers the internal operating
temperature but the 35 55 like this is
basically the second in line for best
power stage that international rectifier
makes and the end result is that
theoretically you could run a maximum
current through this vrm and to the core
of 840 amps because you know each phase
can do 60 amps thanks to the power
stages and then you have 14 phases so
that gives you a
hundred and forty amps and that would be
doable if it weren't for the fact that
an international rectifier 3555 pushing
60 amps of current produces about 12.5
watts of heat so with fourteen of them
that works out to around 175 watts of
heat and you can't actually hit that
current level because the vrm would
quite literally cook itself like it
would produce at that point it produces
more heat than most high-end CPUs
unless you start overclocking in which
case obviously CPUs can get hotter than
that so that's not really a practical
rating for actual current draws that a
1080 TI might get through the vrm this
vrm actually gets really good efficiency
for example 200 amps which is slightly
below what a stock 1080 TI normally
pulls this vrm will produce about 18
watts of heat and that is for the
limited 0.9 volts that Nvidia locks all
their cards to so you know 18 watts of
heat on the vrm pushing that voltage 200
amps and that 300 kilohertz figure from
before if you start going up so like 250
amps which this card will probably hit
this current figure on its own just
because it has a higher stock power
limit at this point it will produce
about 21 watts of heat if you overclock
it manually further the vrm should put
out about 24 point 5 which is still like
this is really really efficient which is
not surprising because this is a
ridiculous erm like 14 phases of 60 amp
hour stages is really really good it
doesn't really get better than this
except maybe 16 phases of 60 amp hour
stages and then technically you can also
build 20 phase 24 and 28 and 32 phase
designs except those are really rare
because they're also really really huge
and impractical so as far as practical
vrm designs goes this is about as good
as it gets
and it really shows because at 300 amps
this is putting out very very little
heat as you keep going higher and higher
so let's say you somehow hit 400 amps I
don't think you can actually do that
even with liquid nitrogen
that 400 amp figure you'll sort of pop
out between 300 and 400
average the card may peak beyond that
you know burst current draw can go
beyond that but on average if these are
rated for continuous so you'll peak
between 300 and 400 amps on liquid
nitrogen even so really this erm is
ridiculous overkill because 400 amps the
vrm will still only put out about 35
watts of heat which is still completely
cool about if you get the vrm some
airflow and it has an adequate heat sink
so that's really nice and just for the
sake of it if you did manage to push 500
amps through this vrm main your issue
being I don't think at 1080 TI even on
liquid nitrogen pushing about 2.6
gigahertz let's say 1 point 6 volts core
won't actually pull 500 amps it won't
pull that much current so if you did
somehow ever get a 1080 TI to pull 500
amps then it would still only produce
about 52 watts of heat which this is
starting to be problematic
you know 52 watts of heat that's not
insignificant but it's still very very
cool about given enough air flow and and
beginning of heat sink so that's not too
bad in fact it's absolutely great
because really the only other vrm that
even well know there's only one VRM on
1080 t is that is actually better than
this one and that's the one found on the
galaxy all of fame card which is a 16
phase also made up of international
rectifier 3555 so you basically get to
more power to more phases of what you
already have here so really this vrm
design is just ridiculous overkill on
for a 1080i like yeah it's ridiculous
overkill for a 1080 TI but this is a
flagship and you know it's unnecessary
yes but even on liquid nitrogen it's
unnecessary but ultimately it really
really isn't a you know it's not like
it's not I don't have a problem as much
of a problem with this as I have with
the 318 because this serves no practical
purpose here you can kind of argue that
well now you can but I'm somehow prefer
I somehow prefer the 1450 RM to the 3 8
pins because this like and now I can't
justify but it is a really really nice
erm even if it's completely overkill for
a 1080 TI anyway let's move on to
something else that's completely
overkill as well the memory vrm which is
a 3-phase located right over here and
controlled by this chip right over there
that chip is a international rectifier
ir35
7-0 running in three-phase mode this is
a chip that does three plus two phase
output so the plus two part is not
running it also does the 200 kilohertz
to two megahertz switching frequency
range it's pretty much the same series
of chip so similar specs on these the
MOSFETs here are dual end fats from Ubik
semiconductor these are qm 38 16 n
MOSFETs these aren't particularly great
you would there then again memory VRMs
really don't need amazing MOSFETs on the
other hand either but these are kind of
slow they're not super efficient but
with three of you know with three phases
worth of these the memory vrm is capable
of putting out 30 amps of current all
only producing about 5 watts of heat so
that is you know plenty for the gddr5 X
memory chips that the card comes with so
again I have no complaints here the
three-phase memory is actually memory
power is also on par with what you'd see
like on the Kingston which is also
three-phase memory power or the Galax
Hall Hall of Fame which is also
three-phase memory power and this does
actually can like get you a couple more
mega hurt megahertz out of memory when
like really really hammering it but the
thing is it's like I'd say even even a
two-phase shouldn't have a problem what
single phase memory do power designs
certainly like yeah
you can go up from there like to phase
designs do have an advantage over single
phase but three phase over two phase on
memory the difference isn't generally
that massive so though I'm not
complaining here like yeah this is just
fine
it is certainly fitting of a card that
has the lightning Nate you know the
Lightning name on it and has a 14-page
Bihar m4 recore on a card that rely on a
GPU core that really really doesn't need
it
so and this is definitely a nice enough
memory of erm and let's start moving on
to all the minor VRMs around the card
like this one right here that one right
well you can't see most of this one it's
on the back of the card but but there is
another rearm here so this right here
that this would be the basically the vrm
that powers that erm and also that vrm
because well basically this would be
variable gate drive you won't actually
you don't
you shouldn't have control over this msi
only really gives you over voltage
control for the four other voltages that
I'll cover later but basically this is
power refers of the RMS to run on and it
should be set to seven volts because
that's where the international rectifier
3555 hits peak efficiency so yeah that's
that's what that is it might be set to
five volts but it's probably set to
seven because that is IR stuff is
optimized to run on seven volts best and
the QM 38:16 certainly won't complain
about running on seven volts either as
those can go all the way up to 15 volts
gate drive so now that's that that VRM
vrm exists it doesn't really affect
overclocking because ultimately it just
affects the efficiency and running
capabilities of the v corps and the
memory drm this vrm down here is the one
volt pecks or PLL valve erm whichever
you prefer to call it this power is part
of the some of the PC as well it powers
the PCIe connection of the GPU and it
also powers the sum of the internal P
eles of the GPU core which is why it's
called pax / PLL this voltage is very
very useful on liquid nitrogen it makes
a huge amount of difference having this
voltage under control
when overclocking on liquid nitrogen
I've done a little bit of overclocking
with Pascal and liquid nitrogen I didn't
actually bother to modify my pecs rail
but from what tin from EVGA said whoo 10
is a power engineer who works with
kingpin on the kingpin cards he said
that this rail is absolutely necessary
if you want to like having voltage
control for pax is absolutely necessary
if you want to exceed 2.5 gigahertz on
liquid nitrogen on air cooling and water
cooling I imagine it does very little if
absolute if nothing at all as that is
typical of Pascal cards meet you know
changing weak or doesn't really do much
changing pax doesn't really do much
changing the memory voltage well I'm not
sure about gddr5 X I imagine it might
scale a little bit with memory voltage
but I'm not sure so yeah not not sure
about that one either and last vrm we
have on here is this VR I'm right here
this is the one point volts this is for
some of the internal PLL with the GPU
core as well as VPP for all of the gddr5
X chips this is basically a little
supporting voltage it doesn't really
affect overclocking much at all even own
liquid nitrogen it doesn't really make
much of a difference now one of the cool
things with this card is that it is kind
of targeted at extreme overclockers so
you do get the usual core voltage
control well you know it's not really
control in my opinion because it's just
that slider that goes plus 100 and then
it still now ends up being 1.0 9 volts
because in video said so but you do get
control some limited control over the
1.8 volt rail the PEX PLL rail the V
chord well Ecore you have everywhere and
the memory voltage you do get software
controller Oh software control over all
of these I am just not sure how
far it goes and how well implemented it
is because I do not have the card in
hand to check that so yeah but there is
a square voltage control for those
though I imagine they do and most of
them shouldn't do anything if you're on
air cooling or water cooling and if
you're on liquid nitrogen I'm not sure
if they're like if the range on them is
high enough I imagine it might not be
just because the core voltage is still
limited to one point oh nine volts even
on this cut like like every MS I've gone
ahead and like giving you some voltage
control over everything else and it's
like the V core is still stuck at the
useless low voltage limit so yeah there
was an attempt at getting voltage
control that's not for sure and I guess
it does mean that if you found some I
guess there must be some kind of like
non public access like tool for this
card that is not accessible to the
general public that gives you higher
voltage controls because MSI has done
that in the past with previous lightning
cards there is such a thing known as
afterburner extreme you've probably
never heard of it because you probably
shouldn't have heard of it
afterburner extreme is a special version
of afterburner that the only way to get
that was to basically message an MSI
representative and and ask for it then
sign an NDA agreement and then then you
got the program and the reason why this
program existed was it gave you a lot
more voltage control all unsay cards
like the GTX 580 lightning 480 lightning
six 970 lightning all sort of the older
lightning cards afterburner extreme was
absolutely necessary for those to be
fully controllable so I imagine there's
a similar situation with this card
because NVIDIA has been pretty strict
about not allowing the general public to
have proper voltage control on their
GPUs because apparently it breaks GPUs
which I guess is true like that yeah
that's true but it's my freaking card oh
if I want to break it I should
be allowed to but yeah ultimately I'm
not sure how well the voltage control is
implemented there's probably a
non-public tool that gives like extreme
overclockers like I could probably ask
for it and get it and get proper voltage
control but for most people I think it's
like if you're buying this card for air
cooling or water cooling I'm going to
say that the extra voltage controls
probably don't do anything and they're
mostly a marketing gimmick if you get if
you want to run the card on ln2 you'll
need to get your hands on a extended
limited version of afterburner or
something which might be a pain as well
other than that it also features for
Ellen to overclockers 3 voltage Reed
points right here which is kind of cool
so you can check memory voltage core
voltage and the I assume this voltage
down here because that's the important
one even though I'm pretty sure this
one's accessible as well it might be
gate drive I'm not sure about that again
I need to see the software for the card
myself but you do get a voltage
measuring capabilities for 3 different
voltages memory GPU and the PLL and this
is really really nice for extreme
overclockers because you can basically
monitor the voltage of the card while
running a benchmark using a digital
multimeter which is also more consistent
because sometimes software just gives
you really really weird readouts
depending on what you're doing so that's
a nice feature to have and then up here
you do get a to a while switch with an
ln2 biles on it I have no idea if that
ln2 BIOS is actually implemented
properly I'm guessing it probably isn't
just because like like most cards that
ship with an Ellen 2 ballast it's like
like well I've never used a previous
lightening so I can't compare to that
but most of the time the lm-2 biases
aren't like you know I imagine this
lifts the power limit and that kind of
thing but I doubt it gives you more
voltage range or well Nvidia cards don't
have cold slow issues you don't actually
need a special balls to remove that
I kind of doubt it does anything more
than lift the power limit which to be
completely honest I think is kind of sad
for a BIOS called the Ln two bottles but
yeah that's the card the PCB is
certainly nice the implementation of the
features on it I have no idea I kind of
suspect they're kind of watered down so
that they're except like so that the
card can be sold to the general public
without people accidentally blowing up
their cards by shoving one point four
volts through the core while on air
cooling or water cooling but ultimately
yeah the PCB is really nice the three
eight pins are kind of stupid
most of the features on this are
completely useless for the average
day-to-day user for extreme overclockers
it really depends on how well they're
implemented but the stuff is here it is
all available it's just a case of does
it work properly so this is definitely a
card I'd love to try out in person like
get around to get a chance to mess
around with it because in theory if
everything is implemented properly on
this it should be exactly like the
kingpin where you buy the card insulate
the card and run it on ln2 because you
may notice that that was one thing I
pointed out on the kingpin is this
entire area of the GPU is again clear of
anything too tall to clear an ln2 pot
except maybe this connector I think some
ellentube Potts might not clear that
that might be an issue but at least the
vcore vrm and all the capacitors are
kept well away from the GPU core so this
could basically like this could be a
really good like this could be really
close to the kingpin in terms of
overclocking capabilities or it could be
really bad depending on how well the
voltage controls are implemented and the
ln2 balls works so yeah that's it for
