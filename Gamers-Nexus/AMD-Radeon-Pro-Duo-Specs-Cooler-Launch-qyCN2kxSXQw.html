Pro duo video card which is a dual GPU
it's got two fiji GPUs in it so it'd be
the same as was used in the fury X it
has two of those it's still liquid
cooled and it's $1,500 so that just came
out we're not gonna get one to review
but we can certainly do a quick recap of
the specs so this is something that's
targeted at VR $1500 units it's a single
card solution with two GPUs and it is
about 350 watt TDP between the two of
them the memory setup is two banks of
four gigabytes of HP M so each GPU has
direct access to four gigabytes of HP m
and they will list that as eight
gigabytes and their specifications which
is not technically incorrect but using
the older API is you're only going to be
accessing four gigabytes of that at any
one time with the new api's though
things change a bit because DirectX 12
in Vulcan can talk to the full pool of
SLI or crossfire memory with their
explicit multi GPU support embedded in
the API directly so that's the basics
the memory bandwidth all this stuff is
the same as you're used to with HBM from
previously but just to recap it's got
one terabyte per second of a total
potential throughput on the memory alone
that's using the high bandwidth memory
that is stackable on the substrate on
top of an inter poser for the GPU and
that was introduced with the fury X so
that's a HBM version one it's using the
feejee GPU and it's got a 4096 bit with
memory interfaces two of those one for
each card so that's all the same it's
just two of them now the card itself is
pushing the sort of liquid VR solution
that AMD has been big on since I believe
GDC maybe a year or two ago now and
liquid VR is basically a means to reduce
time warp which is the effect in virtual
reality where if there's a slight frame
drop or poor low frame time performance
1% low 0.1% low as we call them then
liquid VR will smooth that out and help
reduce the chance of becoming sick or
nauseated as a result of the change in
frame times and frame delivery so that's
what liquid VR does the card has 16
teraflops of compute which is totally
useless for us as gamers for the most
part it's just a lot of power for 15
dollars but that's because being
targeted most heavily at developers and
people working with VR or a high-end 3d
modeling animation those types of
solutions specifically looking at VR and
that's why we're not going to be
reviewing it because it's just out of
scope for the website but it's
interesting to talk about so dual GP
solution at 1,000 megahertz base clock
so it's the core clock for each of the
GPUs and you can overclock that slightly
though we've generally seen about a 50
megahertz overclock for these AMD GPUs
so not too impressive maybe 5 percent
gain best for FPS in games and that
pretty much covers what we got for news
right now other than I guess I didn't
talk about the cooling for a second it's
got fep tubing so this is using the same
sort of modified liquid cooling solution
as was in the fury X and that means that
there's a cold plate on the card for
each of the GPUs and unlike the hybrid
solution cooling which uses a vrm blower
fan for the vrm the cooling solution for
the fury X and the feejee cards this one
in particular the Radeon Pro duo is
using a an FTP tube so that's a more
plastic rigid tube and that has an
insulating layer inside of it that's
that prevents permeation of liquid into
the tubes and loss of liquid over time
they also have sort of an extra tank of
liquid on the 120 millimeter radiator so
if you look at the radiator it's pretty
thick but it has like an extruded
portion below the fan and that is used
to store extra liquid and so that extra
liquid is supposed to help lengthen the
lifetime of the GPU of the liquid
cooling solution which generally they
last about 5 years but it should be a
bit longer on the produ oh and the fury
acts because they have that extra
chamber so that's the set up there the
liquid cooling the liquid itself
temperature will run a bit higher than
you're used to with hybrid solution VR
cooler or vrm coolers because the liquid
for the AMD cards is cooling the
capacitor is the vrm and everything else
and that means overall that the
capacitor leakage should be lower which
helps improve the TDP of the device
overall hence the lower TDP than usual
for AMD so that is the new video card
