which is the company's best attempt at a
discreet silent focused PC that still
retains some cooling ability by way of 3
installed 140 millimeter fans and
ventilation in the top and front panels
today we're reviewing this case and
testing it versus other cases in the
market like the fractal defined C V be
quiet
pure bass 600 and the entire rest of the
case testing suite that we've done in
the last few months before getting to
those that this coverage is brought to
you by EVGA and their 1080p is c2 which
we've recommended fairly highly for its
build quality and the icx sensors which
are kind of fun to play with you can
check our full sc2 review for the 1080i
if you're curious to learn more or you
can click the link in the description
below to find the product page for the
1080i sc2 so starting with the basics
for the case before getting into the
thermal and noise testing and the build
process needs of installation it's a mid
tower supports ATX motherboards standard
ATX power supplies and has a power
supply shroud as the trend now also as
is the trend this is a silverstone case
that has moved away from the ventilation
like you see on the RL 0 6 and instead
it goes with a more sleek design which
is again a bit of a trend ever since the
s2 40 by md XP so that's the design for
the case it's got some ventilation in
the top and on the front side which
helps out a lot with the breathability
as we'll see in testing includes two 140
million fans in the front pre-installed
and they are installed on a cage that's
easily removable so you can more readily
access the fence this also means that
you're only dealing with two screws
rather than eight for the fans and
they're a lot easier to access not the
first time we've seen something like
that but it's always good to see a focus
on these function features in a case
like an $85 unit from silverstone as for
the hard drive cage also another
function feature the cage can be
relocated to one of two or three
different positions so that you can push
it away or pull it in towards the power
supply that way if it's a longer PSU
you get more room for the cabling
otherwise you get some clearance to the
front end for another fan or a larger
radiator the KL 0 7 follows the current
trend of that smooth blank exterior
services with the exception of some
fractal asks side ventilation and
decorative grooves wandering across the
front and top panels power and reset
buttons are hidden within these grooves
leaving a seamless surface except for
the i/o panel including USB type-c
and a nearly invisible silverstone logo
at the bottom silverstone has
experimented with flashy plastic panels
on cases like the primary 0 1 but
there's none of that here and neither is
there a side window windows are a
compromise on cases that claim to be
noise damping and the target audience
likely won't miss it anyway the interior
is plain but easy enough to build in
this is a similar layout for the RL 0 6
with a few optional ads to improve ease
of installation three tools SSD bays
behind the motherboard are cleverly made
if sometimes finicky there's only one
possible orientation for the drives of
SATA and power facing the right side
towards the rear of the case the bays
are attached to the chassis by hinges
which allow them to swing out and accept
the 2.5 inch drive this may not add much
in the way of functionality but it feels
efficient and it eliminates more screws
it means that it's quicker to install
the system these are also well placed
for cable management something that
silverstone has needed to work on for a
while now and they're getting better the
fractal does still beat them out in
terms of that scale management along
with NZXT and the S 240 series so no
messing about with screws with these and
the two list bays offer a bit more
clearance pre heat dissipation anyway
unfortunately the middle bay is
prevented from fully swinging out by
rubber grommet underneath which is a bit
of an oversight by silverstone and
possibly the one up top as well if
cables were routed over it so we're
going to get into testing straight away
here starting with noise and then
thermals as always the link of the
description below contains full testing
methodology alongside Patrick Lathan's
written review on the website if you
prefer the written format he also goes
into more depth on the build process and
cable management
if those aspects are more important to
you started out with noise testing this
time so you know Silverstone 10
millimeter thick foam padding is the
centrepiece of the cases marketing
silverstone uses foam that's more
similar to studio pyramid phone
rising higher than most other cases on
the market while still retaining the
dimples in the material this
theoretically helps break up the sound
wave as it collides with the foam
primarily useful for minimizing
high-frequency noise low-frequency noise
will have an easier time escaping the
enclosure but the only effective way to
stop that is with thick case materials
like 2 to 3 millimeters thick aluminium
as used in some in wind or the Omni
enclosures but this is obviously very
expensive
this helps deaden lower frequencies the
best still silver storms approach is to
deaden high frequencies and that's a
no-go on scene as coil wine fan wine and
pump wine all tend to be in the higher
frequency spectrum anyway we're not yet
testing frequencies but with simpler DBA
testing we're seeing the silverstone KL
0-7 operate at around 30 4.2 DBA when
the case is included at 3 140 millimeter
fans are maxed to 950 rpm making it
effectively identical in performance to
the s3 40 elite at 10:50 rpm the fractal
define C which is at 30 4.8 DBA and the
be quiet period 600 with its pop open
and fans max running 30 4.2 DBA the
fractal to find see technically places
below the others on the chart partly due
to its higher rpm and unmuffled side
window but it's effectively the same
volume to the human ear with low rpm 140
milliliter fans and near total foam
coverage on the KL 0-7 Silverstone's
case is on the low end of our noise
chart in a good way and compares
respectively to other noise damping
cases that we've reviewed as we showed
in the be quiet pure bass 600 review
noise insulation and absorption also
risks heat insulation as flat paneling
with foam makes it more difficult for
the heat to escape the case as no
ventilation then the solace tone kale
0-7 that 10 millimeter thick foam blocks
are larger than most other cases and
what they have but the others often rely
on rubberized foam and so eat into the
airflow space more starting with our
torture test to burn both the CPU and
GPU with power viruses the KL 0-7 CPU
operates at a steady state average of
56.3 celsius delta T over ambient which
ranks it effectively tied with the
Cullinan and a bit cooler than the SD 40
elite at 10:50 rpm the CPU didn't
overheat or experience throttling but
the KL 0-7 does have the unfortunate
burden of being compared to Silverstone
typically well ventilated cases it
even come close to the are l06 is
impressively low 47.8 Celsius CPU DT
under load compared to the practical
defined see the KL 0 7 operates about
the same 56 top 3 vs. 55.8 sells itself
T which is within our 0.5 s LT is plus
or minus window of variance for GPU
temperatures in the torture workload the
KL 0 7 benefits from an intake heavy
design that funnels air into our dual
axial gaming X 1080 with the GPU DT
reporting at 51 our one sells is under
load or about equal to an RL 0 6 with
similar fan rpm with 570 X - 7 erm : n
are also nearby compared to other silent
focus cases like the fractal define C at
57 not for Celsius delta T or the be
quiet pure base 600 at 57.4 associate DT
the silverstone KL 0 7 does well here
blender rendering is next and give us a
real world look at performance starting
with a cpu render the KL 0 7 operates at
CPU temperature of 39 Celsius delta T
over ambient when rendering with the GPU
warming up to 6.9 Celsius as it is hit
by exhausted heat from the CPU we only
just started these tests I don't have a
ton of data on here yet compared to the
RL 0 6 we see an increase in thermal to
about 4 C which has been terrible given
the silent focus of the KL 0 7 looking
nice to a GPU rendering temperatures the
KL 0 7 keeps the video card to 27.5
Celsius delta T which is 10 C cooler
than the entry-level spec of 4k that
throttled up in some tests and a bit
warmer again than the RL 0-6
3d markiplier strike extreme looping for
a half an hour gives us a gaming
workload where both the CPU and GPU work
to heat up the box in a realistic
fashion the CPU ends up at 38 salty
salty over ambience comparable to the
open-air core p3 with the GPU at 55 out
3070 compared to the 50 4.5 Celsius in
the open air case this is into throttled
territory yet but it's not too terribly
far the spec up for was throttling for
perspective so you'd want to ramp up the
GPU fan speed a bit to better deal with
this scenario the silverstone Google i/o
7 this case does not appeal to any one
specific market a lot of cases like the
red line 0 6 appeal to a specific market
so the red line was good for a
performance oriented user
who wants the high focus airflow in the
front panel where you get pretty low and
controllable thermals for something more
silent driven really almost anything
from be quiet would fit that bill and
not necessarily any good in the cooling
Department but they do target silence
and then you're kind of left to your own
devices to sort out the cooling this
case was both decently but neither
silence nor cooling performance the best
so it is a middle ground
jack-of-all-trades for silence and
performance and if you want a little bit
of each it's not a bad case to look at
485 dollars that's the big thing at the
price point 85 dollars it's quite a
reasonable Buy and this is something
where as we do more and more of these
case reviews this year it seems like
it's becoming a trend to see that the
cases right now that we're reviewing are
actually pretty reasonably priced which
isn't something that can be said for a
lot of other aspects and components in
the industry so cases at least I've got
their heads on straight and keeps paint
level but at 85 dollars you should not
buy this for a performance-oriented
build and if you want silence it's
really not bad it does compete directly
with the fractal defined see and the be
quiet pure bass 600 but the thing with
those is the define C excels and cable
management in a few more ways than this
does so define C if you're most focused
on silence and cable management is the
better choice but if you want some of
the cooling performance from something
like the red line series this would be a
good half step and it would be the one
that we recommend
but again fractal does have better cable
management and a bit better noise
isolation in some scenarios it really
just kind of depends on what kind of
hardware you have in there because
ultimately case reviews are the least
scientific of all reviews no matter how
much we work to control them because
when you change the components of the
build really everything else can change
so it all does depend on what you build
with but if your build is similar to
ours then this data should help you make
a choice as far as if you're using a
dual axle fan which let's be honest it's
one of the most common set ups anyway so
that's it for this one if you are
interested to learn more about this case
