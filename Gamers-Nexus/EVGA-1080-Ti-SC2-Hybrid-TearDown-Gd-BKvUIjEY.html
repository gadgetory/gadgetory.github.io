leaving for Computex which is in another
continent so with that time we're going
to tear down at the EVGA hybrid sc2 they
just sent this to us up front I'm going
to tell you we probably won't have time
to fully review this before the show but
we can at least take it apart on the
outside there are some changes visually
to the shroud a few other places we're
going to see if there are any changes
internally to the cooling solution this
is obviously a liquid gold card as you
can see there so this does follow their
hybrid line as small changes to the fan
looks but otherwise it seems like the
same fan what interests me is when I
look down the side here I can see into
the housing and the shell and I can see
a copper plate that looks like it's on
the B Ram so we're the two that does
before getting to that list content is
brought to you by ifixit.com you can go
to ifixit.com slash gamers Nexus to see
our link and you can use code gamers
Nexus for five dollars off at purchase
today we're going to try and use the PC
essentials kit for everything this is a
$20 kit rather than the 60 to 70 dollar
Pro Tech tool kit we normally use I
think this has everything we need but
I'm actually not sure so I've got all
the other ones just in case but what
we're going to do is take this part so
first off that means getting rid of this
and noting the price this is an $800
card this is the most expensive of the
1080p as we've looked at thus far what
the others being the asus strix
at 780 and the FT w3 at 780 and before
we take the screws out I would like to
show everyone these things are you ready
for this this is the poster EVGA why why
do you keep doing this I think I've been
reviewing EVGA cards for a couple years
now maybe the amount of these that have
gone to the recycling bin could probably
create a forest haha just either a
better poster or stop okay or six
stickers by the way for the window of
your case anyway let's take this apart
let's get them the thing that they do
well we
is cooling at least with the icx series
especially so we're going to start out
looks like with Philips there are a
bunch of these that's too big they're a
bunch of the smaller Phillips heads with
this tool kit that is I believe going to
be a size zero zero or zero yes your
zero so we're going to take these back
plate screws out first these go through
the PCB back plate and into the rest of
the into the base plate in theory we'll
find out
fortunately there's no evidence of us
going through the tamper seal okay so
they're sticking with their thermal pads
on everything this one's on the backside
of the MOSFETs and maybe the chokes
that's on the vram right there you can
see the grease outline so that's the
half the back plate off we take this
half off also stuck on by lots and lots
of thermal pad backside the GPU VRAM
VRAM pretty straightforward stuff we've
seen all this before
if you're curious if there's dome pads
have any impact the answer with these
cards that we used is yes it is not
always it doesn't always matter with the
back plate
they don't always actually provide
cooling but we tested these back when we
did the AC x with and without thermal
pads testing where we talked about the
ECX problems and EVGA is solution with
more thermal pads you can see the impact
they have in our testing in that content
if you're curious should be able to come
off at this point it's countless screws
first three six eleven fourteen sixteen
and then four more so we've got 20 total
screws back before holding in the
the front the actual cooler the pump I
should say it's all loose now we're
going to try and get rid of this first
so it's just the shroud it's pretty
interesting this bit different so first
of all I need to pull this out okay cool
there's your shroud if you didn't notice
they've got a new like wannabe
tessellation stuff on here so it's kind
of like the tessellated finish of the FE
card except without the actual
indentations that's new normally just
gray I'm not sure if this is new
I think it is I don't have another
hybrid in front of me right now but this
is an illuminated plate so I'm pretty
sure that's new and it's se 2 which
means probably PI RGB okay so here's
where I get to explain what this mess is
here for we did that once before but
it's been a while let's detach all this
first so first of all you'll notice this
is the extruded plate that or I should
say protruding plate otherwise people
get mad this is a protruding copper
plate that we've been talking about for
a while EVGA uses it in their hybrid kit
and in their hybrid cards the part
that's interesting here is this time
there's actually Tim on the outer rim of
the plate so why is that there because
this is clearly the part contact in the
GPU but not this well if you don't
follow our coverage or haven't made the
connection yourself already you can see
the rim here aligns with the rim on that
the reason there is they're all pasted
here and so much of it is because this
copper plate is contacting vram here via
Ram here via Ram here it's you're
contacting vrm and it's sinking into a
plate that's got to go somewhere it
doesn't it can't just sit there and this
fan is not going to cool it so what it
does is they contact the plate via a lot
of Tim but it's still better than not
doing the solution
to the pump the cold plate and that
conducts they share the same cooling
solution they share the pumps of the GPU
and the vram share the pump that means
your GPU temperatures will look higher
because there are vram temperatures or
the the vram is being synced to the same
module so that makes the measured
temperature go up on the GPU but the
vram goes lower so it's just one of
those trade-offs it's still fine though
you're still ultimately in good shape
really as long as you have even a decent
air cooler on one of these so that's the
solution from the outside is this
already loose it should be okay cool
here is the inside try to keep track of
all their thermal pads there's an sc2
PCB we have already talked up sc2 is a
reference layout with some changes not
too many though not in a crazy fashion
and nothing like that cw3 certainly
which was also detailed so here you can
see some aluminum fins is pretty
standard just gives you some extra
surface area so this is a normal axial
fan it's not one of the radial blower
fans so that pushes down below see the
fins obviously dissipate heat you've got
another stack here and all this is doing
is thinking the FETs the chokes which
really don't need to be synced but they
are anyway and memory VRM and there's
your pads right there that's over here
that's all this right there chokes slash
inductors if you prefer and then
capacitor banks on the smaller they're
all pad right there with memory v RM
stuff at the top so that's thinking that
it's all controlled there we will have
the ability to measure these
temperatures individually we'll use our
own thermocouples as well as EVGA ACX
stuff here is just to kind of hide the
bumps it is non-functional other than
they might help with vibration of it not
sure but it hides the pumps primarily
that sockets on to this which is new so
they've added that
and my said new I should say in relation
to the previous hybrid we looked at
which is probably a 1080 that's not pads
in rough shape oh wait
I removed the tool Ron we got to read
the instructions push down to remove
tools oh my gosh thank you I fix it I
would not have to get that a hat okay
we've saved their whole pad baby all
right
I worry about the rest of it later
smooth it out later so here's our plate
cover plate we've got the mounting
points the contact points be a thermal
pad which again sinks to the pump and
that's the end of the story coin for the
vram and the rest of its just elevated
because the matter of all this needs to
do is contact the pump cold blade
doesn't need to touch the PCB that's
irrelevant so that's the plate and the
pump do we have anything else special to
talk about here LED power pomp and fan
are these merged into one they normally
are yes
so these connect to one right there
so these bridge into each other and then
sock it into the board so you're
controlled by that now what I'm not sure
is how how does icx come into play with
these hybrid cards and we'll find that
out for the review because that's
potentially interesting e six nine three
twos for the feds G six nine three zero
for the memory vrm so nothing nothing
that we haven't talked out in the past
memory vrm we've got you six nine three
zeros up here and then the feds B six
nine three two so that's the card clean
it off I guess and wraps us up so the
hybrid is a this is an S C 2 which means
that they've basically taken their their
other SC to the air
cold one and stuck a liquid cooler on it
so if you watch our air cooled review in
terms of performance gaming things like
that which really isn't going to change
much between these cards the key is that
is you watch that review you'll get an
idea for the baseline we'll look at
thermals and things for this one as
quickly as possible hopefully hopefully
before Computex but that's kind of
pushing it so we will soon find out and
that's it for this one thanks for
watching as always this is the sc2
hybrid 800 bucks maybe wait for our
review before purchasing like always we
found that the 1080i is generally
speaking for gaming if you're looking
for FPS they're all basically the same
there within a couple percent of each
other maybe founders Edition
notwithstanding if you're not bypassing
the thermal limit by instituting your
own fan curve so the only place they
differ is thermals and noise that's what
we're going to test with this one but
we've already tested pretty heavily the
SC to the Strix the FTW three the
gigabyte Oris extreme card and msi
gaming eggs and of those the cooling is
I mean they're really all fine for
cooling once you get to that class of
card but this is still interesting
because liquid cooling means you can
drive down temperatures or temperatures
are driven down by the liquid but you
can sacrifice some of that advantage in
thermal and instead lower your noise by
lowering fan rpm which for these
radiator fans we normally plug them into
the motherboard to do that and then you
have the lowest possible noise while
still retaining temperatures that are
about the same as the others so to fix
temperature or fix the noise output you
end up with better temperatures so
against all that and more as always
thank you for watching subscribe to more
