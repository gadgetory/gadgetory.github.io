what we're doing with some kinetic as we
provide the technology and we license
three pieces of technology one is 3d
depth sense cameras we also licensed to
develop 3d cameras like this camera here
and then we also develop gesture
middleware both for hands some cases and
also full-body skeleton so what we're
showing here is one of our standard
cameras that we built for creative labs
it's got an episode sorry Deb centimes
of interagency a temp sensor an RGB
sensor and a stereo mic we've created a
3d printed a bracket and we've attached
into the oculus VR virtual reality
headset so one thing that did for the
oculus VR it doesn't let you do is it
doesn't like your you interact with the
scene it was about usually it's done
through mouse and keyboard what we've
done is with our training sensing
technology in a camera and our gesture
little where we brought the users hands
into the scene and you're able to
manipulate objects in the virtual space
so what my colleagues seven is doing
then which is he's taking his hand and
he can see the hand on the screen in
chart in his 3d world he's picking up a
block in space he's closing his hand and
moving them somewhere others our own
nice placing it somewhere else in the
streets look like a mind game so what we
need to do that tonight he's got 160
degrees virtual world there to
administer
now what you can do if you want to do
this yourself service equals 0 but you
can get down low to create the brackets
for the printer to go to creatively or
Amazon or the cameras of the boat and
then our software is on the cell
kinetics west side of the field
interacts with the ocular and then above</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
