right here so far has had the most
interesting a i/o solution for video
card that we've yet tested and that
includes the MSI Seahawk / Corsair
hydrographics for the most part but the
gigabyte extreme water forest card which
is right here is the GTX 1080 extreme
with no e water force that cards been
waiting on the sidelines we have not
been able to get one because despite
having a working relationship for
gigabyte for several years they don't
send us review samples of video cards
thankfully one of our viewers Sean did
send over the card for review so thank
you Sean for the card and let's get into
it the gigabyte GT X 1080 extreme water
force as seen through its front window
uses a similar approach to GPU and GPU
component cooling as EVGA does EVGA
solution used a copper plate atop the
vram which you can see in our b-roll and
that then connected via Tim or thermal
interface to the CLC cold plate this
allowed the GPU CLC to be used for
syncing the heat of both the GPU and the
V Ram modules and that meant that EVGA
is GPU CLC shares the solution and runs
an increased GPU diode temperature than
what's found on the simpler GPU only
solution of the Seahawk or hydro
graphics card which is not cool the vram
4 gigabytes card a similar idea is
deployed for vram module cooling and
that's then expanded and refined to
include the vrm this is done by
extending a heat pipe from the copper
vram plate to the aluminum vrm heatsink
and the two are soldered to each other
and then piping all the heat out of the
metal with the liquid cooler and it's
cold plate a hole in the service of the
vram cooling plate allows a GPU cold
plate protrusion to access the GPU
directly this improves the GPU diode
performance the readout with direct
contact and higher density of copper in
the cold plate the GPU cold plates
partial isolation from the vram cold
plate also improves the temperature
performance the cooler master may be
doing something with their liquid flow
within the CLC that furthers this
temperature and we can't take it apart
because it's a loner one thing's for
certain the GPU block is wide
than some of ASA tech solutions that are
purpose-built to cool silicon and this
makes cooler masters larger service area
copperplate fairly capable of handling
all the heat from the vram vrm and GPU
and we'll show those thermal benchmarks
in a moment pe T tubing is used on the
cooler making it more rigid and similar
to a bendy straw in its movement and PE
T tubing if you don't know has an inner
coating along the plastic that helps
insulate the coolant but that coating
can be cracked if the tubes are bent too
much which increases permeation and
liquid loss this is the only downside
really of most coolers of PE T tubing
these days this is contrary to the other
common tubing material a low permeation
rubber use for the EVGA and seahawk
coolers by ASA tech let's get into the
thermal benchmarks for the gigabyte GT X
1080 extreme water force card for this
particular review we're reducing the FPS
charts shown in the video so you'll have
to check the article link to the
description below if you want more FPS
charts because ultimately the
performance between all these 1080s is
pretty much the same so the point here
is we're expanding the thermal and the
noise sections of the review looking at
average temperature during peak load the
gigabyte 1080 extreme water force card
manages to run at about 25 point 1 7 C
delta T over ambiens with an idol of
3.39 see that places gigabyte solution
between the corsair and msi Seahawk
which is the same thing at 18 point 5 C
and the EVGA 1080 FTW at twenty nine
point six one C's was right in the
middle pump rpm likely plays a role in
this and the fan choice also plays a big
role as we explored in the GT X 1080
hybrid versus Seahawk content voltage
also just as an aside does have some
impact and gigabytes card runs at a
higher voltage than the EVGA S at 1.5
volts and EVGA s runs at a higher
voltage than Corsairs gigabytes clock
rate is also higher which leads us to
believe that the cooler master solution
is likely running that higher pump rpm
already discussed and that it better
isolates the GP portion of the cold
plate and potentially that the fan has
some impact on temperature performance
too in this case the gigabyte fan may be
a little bit better but there's a lot of
variables with this gigabyte card
because of just how much it's actually
cooling the VRM
is the biggest difference let's look at
the temperature overtime charge this is
the same data as we just saw just plot
it against the time on the x-axis the
point of this chart is to show the
ramp-up time of the cooler as you can
see they're all pretty much the same at
least these days looking at our
endurance charts is a little more
interesting though and it shows what
you're seeing on the screen it now this
endurance chart shows the gigabytes 1080
extreme water forest cards performance
over a two hour endurance run as we've
seen with numerous and video GPUs this
generation the card is clock dropping
several times after the 80 minute area
of testing clock drops fall to about two
thirty five megahertz with this card in
particular and normally lasts for one
second during some GPU boost
functionality and variance in one
instance though we had a thirty second
period of reduced clock rates that
caused a visual freeze in our Metro last
light loop and this is something that
we're exploring within this architecture
still Nvidia believes that the
one-second drops are part of normal
boost 3.0 functionality and as GPU boost
will find any possible times reduce its
clock rate in favor of power and
thermals that might be correct but we're
still researching if the card thinks it
can get away with such a reduction it'll
do it and try and reduce some of the
power draw over a longer gaming session
as long as the card thinks so to speak
that it won't impact the FPS but we have
a lot more research to do on this part
of the new architecture in the meantime
what we can see is generally comparable
performance to the other cards except
with a nearly perfectly flat clock rate
and the gigabyte solution that's what
you want so on the screen you should be
able to see at least two of the other
cards the EVGA hybrid and the MSI
Seahawk or Corsair hydrographic same
thing and looking at these at versus the
gigabyte unit we've got a testament to
gigabytes thermal and power solutions
GPU boost is able to sustain its high
clock rate of about twenty twelve
megahertz for the entire test and that's
because thermal isn't an issue and
voltage runs at one point oh five volts
perfectly flat for the entire time for
the most part and in this regard the
card outperforms its other liquid-cooled
competition just in terms of a flatter
clock rate this Seahawk x and EVGA FTW
cards have far spiky or clock rates not
terrible on EB J's for the most part
when you're actually playing games
but it does show up in benchmarks and it
does impact the lo metrics after a
certain point of testing now looking at
noise levels you can find our
methodology for noise testing on the
website we only do a DB output test
right now with an a filter there is no
frequency spectrum analysis because it's
just frankly out of scope for the site
there are other folks who are better
equipped for that but we can do the
basics and what we've learned from
testing is that the msi Seahawk /
corsair hydrographics is generally
either slightly quieter than the EVGA
hybrid or basically tied in the case of
the radiator fan at 30% and 50% the EVGA
hybrid and msi seahawk are about the
same decibel level output and when
moving to 100% fan speed we can see that
there's a bit of a gap that develops but
there's a large gap with the gigabyte
water force card and that's because
their fan runs at a higher rpm maximally
it's over 3,000 rpm actually on the
radiator fan and that's partly because
at gigabyte are actually mostly because
gigabyte is cooling their entire PRM
vram and GPU solution with just one fan
not with a separate blower fan like
these other cards have always levels
overall are acceptable generally because
of the performance of all these coolers
you could actually run them all at a 30%
fan speed and be fine for temperatures
you'd be below most if not all air
coolers depending on what you're
comparing against and you'll basically
never hit 100% fan speed for the
gigabyte card because it's just it
doesn't need that much cooling it's way
more cooling that it's necessary the
card generally sits around 30% and for
comparison this is where it's a bit
interesting the Seahawk and the EVGA
card will generally hit around 50% max
for sort of the depend on what you're
looking at the view on blower fan or if
you want to get similar temperature
results to us you'd be at either 100%
fan speed or 50% fan speed and the only
deciding factor there is how you can
figure at EVGA s fan plugs into their
board and Corsairs goes into the
motherboard so you can figure the
motherboard obviously as you see
fit for fans be generally fifty or a
hundred percent is where you'll be that
would make the gigabyte card at thirty
percent about the same volume as the
EVGA and the MSI cards to that and noise
isn't a huge deciding factor unless
you're looking at really specific
scenarios like 100 percent fan speed or
if you're trying to run some extreme
overclock for long periods of burn and
time with a poorly ventilated case
starting with the FPS tests again more
of them in the article link of the
description below doom at 1440p ultra
positions the gigabyte extreme water
force card just above the EVGA solution
for OpenGL tests with gigabyte at 120
7.7 FPS average and identical 1% and
0.1% lows to the EVGA FTW hybrid which
runs at 120 4.3 FPS average the two
cards are for the most part identical in
OpenGL performance for doom and this
remains true when we switch over to
Vulcan positioning the cards within
reasonable boost variants of one another
when considering current doom Vulcan and
NVIDIA performance limitations at 1080p
ultra the cards are effectively
identical and Vulcan performance the 0.1
FPS is within variants and can be
ignored as equal and just for clarity
that's not 0.1% lows it's 0.1 FPS
difference between the two OpenGL
performance is also mostly the same with
the two barely trading of lows and
averages and in 1% lows so there's no
significant difference between these
cards in this benchmark 4k high settings
and Mirror's Edge catalyst position the
gigabyte card marginally ahead of the
tide EVGA hybrid and MSI Seahawk cards
with 52 FPS average on 42.7 fps 1% lows
all three liquid-cooled GTX 1080s
and the MSI twin frozen air-cooled 1080
are performing more or less identically
1440p also shows this with a 95 FPS
average across the board for the three
liquid-cooled cards and the one twin
frozer air-cooled card as with the
previous two charts were seeing
basically identical performance on the
GTX at 1080 extreme water forest card as
with the hybrid from EVGA and the hydro
graphics from Corsair an MSI all around
59 FPS average and 45 to 47 fps
one percent lows nothing exciting with
these FPS benchmarks but that's what you
expect when testing three cards are the
same a GPU in this case GP 104 - 400
let's move on to overclocking for other
charts on fps check the article in the
description below here's our overclocked
stepping table for the gigabyte 1080
extreme water force card we were able to
achieve a maximum stable clock rate of
2100 5 megahertz which peaked at 21 51.5
megahertz on occasion memory
overclocking landed us at an effective
clock rate of 11 gigahertz aided by a
huge power target allowance by the
gigabyte solution the card was most
stable with no real voltage offset and
went at a 100 megahertz core offset and
400 megahertz memory offset combined our
own 1080 founders edition hybrid -
custom mod that we built months ago at
this point it's still the best overclock
we tested from this generation but all
the board partner cards seem to be
pretty lucky if you're able to achieve a
2100 megahertz clock rate with
overclocking on the AME partner cards as
shown in other OC stepping tables the
EVGA card managed a higher stable
overclock at 2150 1.5 mega Hertz with a
peak of 21 64 MSI seahawk maxed out at a
20 50 megahertz stable core clock with
peaks at 21 26 in our tests the card
runs a reference board though and is
more simplistic in its power and thermal
design the EVGA and gigabyte solutions
are far more advanced in that both of
them cool at least via Ram and gigabyte
is cooling the vrm as well they also
both use aftermarket PCBs that are
higher quality than the reference design
from Nvidia the gigabyte water force
card this one was bought at 770 dollars
on new idea by Shaun our viewer who
loaned it to us in theory the MSRP is
maybe a bit lower than that but 770 is
what he was able to buy it for I've not
been able to find it in stock since we
started looking at it but that makes it
the most expensive 1080 we've looked at
yet other than I suppose the Seahawk ek
card which we haven't reviewed but we
tore down is a pretty expensive solution
we might talk about that more later in
terms of the actual cards you can buy
off shelf and use without an open-loop
cooler this one is the most expensive
7-7
the EVGA zhou runs about 7:30 for the
price and then the msi Seahawk and
corsair hydro graphics card is seven
hundred and fifty dollars so it's twenty
more than the EVGA hybrid which we
already kind of covered in the hybrid
versus Seahawk review where basically
the conclusion was this is a much better
buy for the most part unless coarser
name as I drop their price closer to
seven hundred dollars far more
reasonable for reference board with a
less intricately designed cooler but
that doesn't change the fact of this
thin seven seventy so we're forty
dollars over the EVGA hybrid with the
gigabyte solution the gigabyte solution
does run a slightly cooler core temp it
cools the vrm better in theory that we
don't really have a good way to measure
vrm temps through software it would have
to be done by drilling a hole into a
cold plate and planting a thermocouple
in there or something like that
certainly not going to do that but in
theory this cools its power design
components better than the EVGA card the
EVGA card is well within acceptable
range for overclocked and overclocked
slightly better in fact then the
gigabyte extreme water force card but to
some extent that is silicon lottery to
use kind of the buzz phrase it's just
manufacturing differences in general
these cards for Pascal are pretty hit
and miss with overclocking as evidenced
by the high over clocks on some of the
founders Edition cards like our
apparently golden sample card that we
ought to 2164 with a liquid cooling mod
so as it stands right now EB J's Hybrid
is tough to beat for the price at the
seven hundred thirty dollar range its
performance is good they perform
basically the same with FPS they perform
pretty close with cooling gigabyte does
have a better more sophisticated
solution and one that I hope EVGA might
consider for their next series of video
cards whatever that may be so in terms
of just the thermal solution this is
pretty interesting
and pretty cool from a design standpoint
not just a thermal standpoint but as a
buyer I would kind of push you towards
the EVGA solution because it's more
affordable ideally even this drops
closer to seven hundred seven thirty is
kind of poor
the price comfort zone I guess a little
bit but 770 is pretty high up there or
750 whatever it may be so that's what
you have to think about basically price
the noise charts all that and additional
FPS charts are in the article below if
you want more information to try and
make your decision ultimately they're
both good cards and they're just
expensive so it's it's down to price and
that's up to you to decide more on if
it's worth it for your build thank you
