waves this weekend following a leaked
jiff from one of their developers and
it's really not a surprise that such a
leak would occur because believe it or
not there are over 200 developers
working on Mass Effect Andromeda or we
could have potentially caught Mass
Effect 4 but Bioware does not want to
use that name because they are very
clearly trying to paint the picture that
the first three games are very different
closed and finished from the next set of
games starting with Andromeda so what is
the jiff well this leaked shows a jet
pack in use and that's really about all
we got but there's some stuff we can
derive from that and most importantly is
the fact that there's an element of
verticality in Mass Effect Andromeda
something that has not been present in
the first three games and if we look
through some of the other items that we
know about Andromeda one of the more
interesting tie-ins to this verticality
element is their use of frostbite as the
new game engine so this is the first
Mass Effect game to use frostbite the
first three used Unreal Engine 3 which
of course is now sort of deprecated as
for has taken over but the shift of
frostbite is key if only because as we
know from the battlefield games and some
other games that use it it is
specialized in sort of destructible or
deformable elements within the game
normally buildings or terrain elements
and whether or not that destruction will
come into play is yet to be shown but
that would be sort of our hypothesis is
that there may be some level of building
deformation or destruction within
Andromeda and in the very least it's a
new game engine and it does act
consistently with Bioware's gradual push
into a more action focused RPG than the
first Mass Effect game which was
somewhat more aligned with kotor and
that it was more RPG driven than action
driven and it's gotten progressively
more action intensive which isn't
necessarily a bad thing so the jiff does
show a jetpack it shows it being used
you can boost up in the air and do
vertical movement which is sort of cool
but that's about all we have right now
this again is a leak it looks legit but
there's really no telling whether this
thing actually made it in the game or
not at this point so stay tuned for more
news on Mass Effect and all the other
forthcoming games for this season Mass
Effect 4 or Andromeda as it is
accurately called is due for the first
quarter of 2017 and that is following a
pushback that happened this year it was
due out originally this year in the
holiday season but that's been moved to
2017 if you like this type of coverage
