favorite quick release valves but their
previous attempt at a semi open-loop
cooler the ek predator terminated after
an overwhelming amount of issues with
leakage it was a shame too because the
predator was genuinely one of the best
performing coolers we'd ever tested for
noise normalized performance and
ultimately if it can't hold water it's
all kind of irrelevant ek is attempting
to redeem themselves today with the
modular semi open approach set forth
with the new ek mlc Phoenix series a
viewer recently loaned us their ek mlc
Phoenix 360 cooler and Intel CPU block
which we then immediately put to work on
the bench before that this video is
brought to you by thermal grizzly makers
of the conductor hot liquid metal that
we recently used to drop 20 degrees off
of our coffee leak temperatures
thermal grizzly also makes traditional
thermal compounds we use on top of the
IHS like cryo not and hydro not pastes
learn more at the link below so this is
ek is 360 millimetre liquid cooler it's
a modular kit basically the one we have
here came from a viewer and the viewer
purchased the 360 millimetre radiator
which includes three of their Vardar Evo
fans and with that the viewer also
purchased an Intel block so this is the
CPU cooler there is no GPU cooler in
this one so you could buy a separate GPU
block if you wanted to it increases the
price significantly but today we're just
testing the CPU cooling component so
this is a semi open-loop it's basically
a closed-loop right now however you
could use the quick disconnect valves
the QDC valves and attach another
component to the loop if you desired and
in that way it's kind of an easier
version like a not even a baby's first
loop it's like even before that so this
is a quick way to get into a semi open
loop design but it is kind of expensive
just for these components it cost the
viewer who loaned it to us about two
hundred eighty dollars so I believe when
I checked a moment ago the CB block for
the Intel cooling component was eighty
bucks and then this radiator plus fans
almost two hundred dollars on its own
that's for the design it's pretty
straight forward it's very similar to
the predator previously but improved in
a few ways I mean one would hope
considering the predator had a whole lot
of leakage reviews by consumers on new
AG Amazon and other retailers so this
one is still a pump on radiator designs
at the pump is located up here you've
got some sort of tank up there as well
and then the block for the rest and it's
really that simple
so if you do connect multiple components
to this loop like a GPU block if it
doesn't contain a pump within it you're
basically going to want to ramp this RPM
up to the max and it does create some
pump whine which is something we'll talk
about momentarily once we get into the
noise section so that's the very basics
of this cooling solution this is not
quite a closed-loop liquid cooler it's
far more expensive but it's also
something you can add GPU blocks to the
question is whether or not that's
actually worth it or if you should start
looking towards things like proper open
loops at that point although they are a
bit more complex to get into so let's go
through the thermal numbers and see how
that looks
then we'll talk conclusion and value at
the end we're starting out with a chart
that only shows our ek MLC Phoenix tests
and then we'll add the rest of the
coolers momentarily
this chart shows all of our Phoenix
testing including some quick push pole
configurations and noise normalized 40
DBA configurations EK ships the unit
with a stock pole configuration for the
fans and in that out of box
configuration it does the best it
operates with a load temperature of
about thirty two point six degrees over
ambient this was followed by a push
configuration test using an allen key to
flip the fans around which then gave us
a thirty three point seven degree Delta
Z over ambient so completely 100% within
margin of error at that point and that
would also suggest that there's no
appreciable difference between push and
pull configurations in an open-air
format in fact if you saw any impact
from changing the push versus pull
layout at all we would suspect that it
be more dependent on your specific use
case ie the literal case that you're
putting it in and the rest of the
cooling configuration within that case
that would be more impacting than an
open air from what we've seen
normalizing at 40 DBA increases our
temperatures by
degrees as you'd expect and the increase
is outside of error margins so it is
actually measurable although it's not
necessarily appreciable to probably 90
plus percent of users we'll talk about
this more in a moment
moving on to our steady-state chart for
all tested devices the ek MLC Phoenix
readily claims its position I'm on the
top three coolers we've tested its
performance is within error margins of
the EB GAC LC 280 and the Corsair H 115
I we do not have the measurement
resolution required to determine any
difference between these three devices
at this point in the very least we can
confidently state that the ek MLC
Phoenix 360 unit cooling only the CPU is
a top three cooler on our charts its
performance is admirable here and the
coolers of Vardar fans are a large
contributor to the advantaged cooling
capabilities to give us some perspective
on where the Phoenix leads we see it
ahead of the crack in X 62 outside of
error margins and ahead of the ice bear
4/20 which suffers from both awful fans
and a pump which is comparatively anemic
to the large radiator size more
importantly the ek Phoenix 360 silenced
to 40 DBA
performer is better than about 80% of
our charted items on this larger chart
meaning that it has a lower noise
performance and still exceeds the
flat-out cooling performance of most of
its competitors we don't have every
single cooler we've tested on this chart
mostly because we'd run out of space but
the ek Phoenix at 40 DBA lands at 7th
verses about 40 tested configurations on
this testbed which include largely
liquid coolers so that's damn good
performance normalizing for 40 DBA the
ek MLC Phoenix 360 unit chart tops once
again though it is technically within
margin of error of our second-place line
item B Kraken X 62 280 milliliters
cooler the Phoenix ends up at 35 degrees
delta T over ambient and is mostly
comparable in size to the three sixty
millimeter coarser h1 50 I the h1 50
islands at thirty six point eight here
of course as always this is noise levels
in decibels when we're looking at 40 DBA
for noise normalization so we're not
accounting for the type of noise
although the ek Phoenix it does rank as
best for noise normalized performance at
40 DBA it still has an audible pump
whine
during use so it's type of noise is a
bit more annoying than other items at 40
decibels you may want to manually step
down the pump if using this only the
coolest CPU though the higher speed will
significantly benefit combined CPU and
GPU loops we're not sure the pump line
is just in our sample or if it's a wider
spread issue but one note where the item
is that we were able to reduce some
other noises like turbulence caused by
the fans by remounting the fans andrey
securing the cables they were a bit
loose and that was causing some chatter
when the fans were going at full speed
as for flat out noise tested in our
standardized environment with a noise
floor of 26 DBA the ek Phoenix ends up
about 48 DBA but can spike up to 50 when
pumping gets bad this does make it one
of the louder coolers but not the
loudest that still go to EVGA loudness
is ultimately a function of how fast a
manufacturer is allowing the fans to
spin and what's more important is the
noise normalized thermals that we
already showed you as they help
illustrate how well a cooler can perform
when under constrained conditions so
this cooler does well overall it's a 360
millimeter cooler it's appearing above
other 360s and some of our charts in
terms of thermal and noise of their own
performance it's one of the leaders in
both categories at least if you ignore
the flat-out noise levels when we run it
at 100% rpm it does well it's $280 this
isn't something we would recommend
buying if you're just going for a high
performance liquid cooler that's easy to
use because in that case you could save
more than $100 and get a properly closed
loop however if there's a specific use
case you want this for for example
adding a GP block with something like a
Kraken or of course our H Series cooler
couldn't do then it's a good option but
again at that point it's starting to get
so expensive that it's time to look at
what open loops caused and see what kind
of difference it is in price to jump to
it and then if that's worth it to you
this is going to be a lot easier to set
up it's simpler it's basically to quick
disconnect valves and then you install
everything else just like you would for
any GPU cooler or any CPU block so it is
pretty trivial to setup but
overall we do like the cooler quite a
bit for its performance it's just
expensive so maybe not the most
practical purchase but if you already
had your heart set on it because you
just really wanted it well you can at
least buy it knowing that it's good so
there's that much at least and as always
we think anyone who sent stuff in for
loan to review it's certainly helpful
this is a good one but we'll have to be
sending it back now so thank you for the
