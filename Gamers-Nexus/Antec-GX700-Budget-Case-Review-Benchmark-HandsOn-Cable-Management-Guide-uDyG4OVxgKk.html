nexus dotnet and today we are looking at
aunt xgs 700 budget glass gaming case
which retails in the 60 dollar price
range and is targeted toward entry level
systems and budget gaming pcs I built
our test bench in the GX seven hundred
and benchmark for thermals using
multiple fan configurations and the
stock configuration I also routed all
the cables and did basic quality checks
for the review so before we get to all
of that all the actual reviewing of the
case as always let's go over the hard
specs of the case before diving into my
own analysis and opinions to give you an
idea of what we're working with here
we'll hit thermal data toward the end
along with alternative case
recommendations if you don't like this
one so first of all I first saw this
case at CES 2013 where antec showcased
the cases basic features and and the
aesthetic of it but here we have a bit
more detail so first of all as for
objective specs the GX 700 stands at a
pretty non-threatening 20 inches tall
firmly ranking it as a mid tower ATX
enclosure it's not a massive case but
it's not tiny either so if you want
something that can be desk-bound and
you're not terrified will fall over and
punch a hole through your wood floor
then this is probably about the right
size for that but anyway it's the GX 700
comes equipped stock with three case
fans in total 21 40 millimeter top
exhaust fans and one 120 millimeter rear
exhaust fan there are no intake fans in
the stock configuration and most cpu
coolers will fit in the GX 700 given its
172 millimetres cpu cooler high
allowance although some wider coolers
may collide with the side intake
position so be aware a couple of non
grommeted cable routing holes are
present in the standard locations on the
board Trey there's nothing really flashy
here just the basics so you can pretty
easily route the front panel and power
connectors through the cutouts though
the Sato location isn't ideal for some
ATX boards so the rear side of the case
has 13 millimeters of clearance between
the board tray and the side panel and
surprisingly this actually ended up
being plenty of room
for my stacked 24 pin and 6-pin
connector cable routing though I did put
some effort into tying it all very close
to the board Trey the GX 700 also comes
equipped with a couple of stylized
elements and switches on the outside
included among these is a fan speed
controller the fan speed controller is
not a linear dial it is actually a
toggle so it just toggles from Maximum
low or off settings and this is done by
throttling voltage to the fans adjusted
pics either max voltage or a throttled
voltage and then that lowers the fan
speed pretty standard stuff the fan
speed switch is concealed under a cold
war-era nuclear launch cover so
depending on your taste that's either
extremely gaudy or kind of cool and I'll
leave that entirely up to you as it is
more of a subjective thing the exterior
on the whole is largely the same way
antics own logo kind of showcases this
as it is branded on a dog tag attached
to the front panel and then of course
the power button is a large cheap piece
of plastic that's kind of colored with
like the USSR red so if you like that
kind of thing awesome check it out if
not then I don't know maybe strip the
paint or something in general the case
resembles a cheaper version of course RC
70 so if you want the c70 but can't
quite afford it then this is probably
your best bet in the budget range the
paint isn't anything to brag or complain
about so really it's just another
idiosyncratic matter if you like the
color you like it if you don't you know
what are you going to do let's talk
about cable management and installation
now so these are a bit more flexible
elements here cable management was
shockingly easy in the GX 700 it wasn't
as easy as say a 150 or 200 dollar case
but very easy and surprisingly so for a
budget case it did have a couple of
caveats that I want to note for those of
you who buy this and need some help
routing cables for starters the HD audio
cable is incredibly short and the header
wouldn't fit through the optimal cable
pass through if the power supply was
already mounted for this reason I had
suggested outing all I ok Buhl's and
connecting them to the board prior to
mounting the power supply and then
go ahead and route your mount the PSU
and connect the power connectors from
that the PSU won't pinch the cables or
cause any damage at least in my build
obviously you should judge this on an
individual basis but it is large enough
to prohibit cable routing if already
mounted so keep that in mind other than
that all the cables fit behind the board
and the panel closed without any warping
or outward bowing for a sixty-dollar
case this is a feat worthy of note so
I'm noting it if you're working with a
non modular psu your and you probably
are if you're buying a case at this
price it'll be a bit tougher to hide all
the cables but as possible with right
finagling i would suggest removing the
bottom to drive brackets and then kind
of snake your cables into that drive
cage area try to do so without blocking
front intake if you have a fan there
finally we hit benchmarks I tested the
stock configuration against several
aftermarket configurations basically in
an attempt to answer the often asked
question of if I added one more fan what
and where should it be to see those
tests hit the article link in the
description below that said let's talk
about the benchmark against other cases
our test methodology uses a clean system
with an i5 3570k at 4.4 gigahertz CPU
tests are run using prime95 and logged
using hardware monitor and then
normalized in a spreadsheet the GPU
component is tested with an XFX 7850
video card which is a pretty small card
so it doesn't generate the same amount
of heat as something that's bigger like
a 680 or 780 and let's just jump into it
here's the CPU benchmark for the GX 700
you should mostly be looking at the GX
700 versus Rose wells are 5 which is a
fifty-dollar case right now
Silverstone's KL 0 for Andrade Max's
Cobra case on high settings the GX 700
ranks firmly between the competing Cobra
and r5 though one of my fan optimization
tricks did place the GX 700 up just
below the are 5 and above the 820 so
kind of vision it there if you do one of
my fan tricks again hit the article link
for that performance is largely
uninspiring but isn't bad
we'll call it above average for a
sixty-dollar case and then move on so
here's the GPU text again nothing to
write home about our GPU thermal delta
only has a swing of five celsius total
between all the cases so things are
fairly stable across the board and
uninteresting the GX 700 on high
settings rest between the KL 04 and
Cobra again it is below the r5 it seems
if you're looking for peak thermal
performance the r5 is the way to go
let's be realistic though most of us
aren't going to notice a 12 to see
thermal Delta between cases if you're
working with hotter hardware like AMD
products and really want to overclock
but are confined in a cheap case then
definitely pay close attention to
temperature data pick the coolest case
if you're not planning on doing much
overclocking or enthusiast work and just
want to build a cheap system pick based
on quality of materials construction
ease of installation and aesthetics
whatever you're going to be okay with
looking at for a few years at the end of
the day the GX 700 has solid build
quality all the paneling is sturdy and
firm even the plastic front panel
surprisingly was pretty easy to remove
and sturdy which was awesome after
working with the aged 6 30 and it also
has good cable management features
decent ease of installation features for
novices and average to above-average
cooling I can pretty readily recommend
the gx7 hundreds of system builders
looking to get a case in the fifty to
sixty dollar range but there are some
seriously good alternatives out there
I'd strongly encourage you to look into
Corsairs 200r and rose wells are five
both links below if you if you kind of
want to look at the competition if you
have more room in your budget and want
something similar to the GX seven
hundred but a bit higher quality look
into corsair c70 case that's all for
this review be sure to check the article

see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
