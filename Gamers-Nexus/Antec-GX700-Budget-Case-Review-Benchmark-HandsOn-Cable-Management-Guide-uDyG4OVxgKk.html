Nexus dotnet and today we are looking at
an Tex GX 700 budget glass gaming case
which retails in the $60 price range and
is targeted toward entry-level systems
and budget gaming pcs I built our test
bench in the GX 700 and benchmark for
thermals using multiple fan
configurations and the stock
configuration I also routed all the
cables and did basic quality checks for
the review so before we get to all of
that all the actual reviewing of the
case as always let's go over the hard
specs of the case before diving into my
own analysis and opinions to give you an
idea of what we're working with here
we'll hit thermal data toward the end
along with alternative case
recommendations if you don't like this
one so first of all I first saw this
case at CES 2013 where an tech showcased
the cases basic features and and the
aesthetic of it but here we have a bit
more details so first of all as for
objective specs the GX 700 stands at a
pretty non-threatening 20 inches tall
firmly ranking it as a mid tower ATX
enclosure it's not a massive case but
it's not tiny either so if you want
something that can be desk bound and
you're not terrified will fall over and
punch a hole through your wood floor
then this is probably about the right
size for that but anyway it's the GX 700
comes equipped stock with three case
fans in total to 140 millimeter top
exhaust fans and one 120 millimeter rear
exhaust fan there are no intake fans in
the stock configuration and most CPU
coolers will fit in the GX 700 given its
172 millimetres CPU cooler hi allowance
although some wider coolers may collide
with the side intake position so be
aware a couple of non grommeted cable
routing holes are present and the
standard locations on the board tray
there's nothing really flashy here just
the basics so you can pretty easily
route the front panel and power
connectors through the cutouts though
the SATA location isn't ideal for some
ATX boards so the rear side of the case
has 13 millimeters of clearance between
the board tray and the side panel and
surprisingly this actually ended up
being plenty of room for
my stacked 24 pin and six pin connector
cable routing though I did put some
effort into tying it all very close to
the board tray the GX 700 also comes
equipped with a couple of stylized
elements and switches on the outside
included among these is a fan speed
controller the fan speed controller is
not a linear dial it is actually a
toggle so it just toggles from maximum
low or off settings and this is done by
throttling voltage to the fans it just
it picks either max voltage or a
throttled voltage and then that lowers
the fan speed pretty standard stuff the
fan speed switch is concealed under a
cold war-era nuclear launch cover so
depending on your taste that's either
extremely gaudy or kind of cool and I
will leave that entirely up to you as it
is more of a subjective thing the
exterior on the whole is largely the
same way antics
own logo kind of showcases this as it is
branded on a dog tag attached to the
front panel and then of course the power
button is a large cheap piece of plastic
that's kind of colored with like the
USSR red so if you like that kind of
thing awesome check it out if not then I
don't know maybe strip the paint or
something in general the case resembles
a cheaper version of Corsair C 70 so if
you want the C 70 but can't quite afford
it then this is probably your best bet
in the budget range the paint isn't
anything to brag or complain about so
really it's just another idiosyncratic
matter if you like the color you like it
if you don't you know what are you gonna
do let's talk about cable management and
installation now so these are a bit more
flexible elements here cable management
was shockingly easy in the GX 700 it
wasn't as easy as say a 150 or 200
dollar case but very easy and
surprisingly so for a budget case it did
have a couple of caveats that I want to
note for those of you who buy this and
need some help routing cables for
starters the HD audio cable is
incredibly short and the header wouldn't
fit through the optimal cable
pass-through if the power supply was
already mounted for this reason I had
suggest writing all i/o cables and
connecting them to the board prior to
mounting the power
fly and then go ahead and route your
amount the PSU and connect the power
connectors from that the PSU won't pinch
the cables or cause any damage at least
in my build obviously you should judge
this on an individual basis but it is
large enough to prohibit cable routing
if already mounted so it keeps that in
mind other than that all the cables fit
behind the board and the panel closed
without any warping or outward bowing
for a $60 case this is a feat worthy of
note so I'm noting it if you're working
with a non modular PSU you're and you
probably are if you're buying a case at
this price it'll be a bit tougher to
hide all the cables but as possible with
the right finagling I would suggest
removing the bottom to drive brackets
and then kind of snake your cables into
that drive cage area try to do so
without blocking front intake if you
have a fan there finally we hit
benchmarks I tested the stock
configuration against several
aftermarket configurations basically in
an attempt to answer the often asked
question of if I added one more fan what
and where should it be to see those
tests hit the article link in the
description below that said let's talk
about the benchmark against other cases
our test methodology uses a clean system
with an i-5 35 70 K at 4.4 gigahertz CPU
tests are run using prime95 and logged
using Hardware monitor and then
normalized in a spreadsheet the GPU
component is tested with an X FX
7850 video card which is a pretty small
card so it doesn't generate the same
amount of heat as something that's
bigger like a 680 or 780 and let's just
jump into it here's the CPU benchmark
for the GX 700 you should mostly be
looking at the GX 700 vs. Roseville's r5
which is a $50 case right now
Silverstone's KL 0 4 and raid maxes
Cobra case on high settings the GX 700
ranks firmly between the competing cobra
and r5 though one of my fan optimization
tricks did place the GX 700 up just
below the R 5 and above the 820 so kind
of vision it there if you do one of my
fan tricks again hit the article link
for that performance is largely
uninspiring but it isn't
we'll call it above average for a $60
case and then move on so here's the GPU
text again nothing to write home about
our GPU thermal Delta only has a swing
of 5 Celsius total between all the cases
so things are fairly stable across the
board and uninteresting the GX 700 on
high settings rest between the KL o 4
and Cobra again it is below the R 5 it
seems if you're looking for peak thermal
performance the R 5 is the way to go
let's be realistic though most of us
aren't going to notice a 1 - 2 C thermal
Delta between cases if you're working
with hotter hardware like AMD products
and really want to overclock but are
confined in a cheap case then definitely
pay close attention to temperature data
picked the coolest case if you're not
planning on doing much overclocking or
enthusiasts work and just want to build
a cheap system take based on quality of
materials construction ease of
installation and aesthetics whatever
you're gonna be ok with looking at for a
few years at the end of the day the GX
700 has solid build quality all the
paneling is sturdy and firm even the
plastic front panel surprisingly was
pretty easy to remove and sturdy which
was awesome after working with the aged
630 and it also has good cable
management features decent ease of
installation features for novices and
average to above-average cooling I can
pretty readily recommend the GX 700 to
system builders looking to get a case in
the 50 to $60 range but there are some
seriously good alternatives out there I
strongly encourage you to look into
Corsairs 200 R and Roseville's R 5 both
links below if you if you kind of want
to look at the competition if you have
more room in your budget and want
something similar to the GX 700 but a
bit higher quality look into Corsair c
70 case that's all for this review be
sure to check the article link the
description below and I will see you all
next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
