dotnet and today we're talking about the
msi seahawk GTX 980 video card and this
was made in cooperation with coarse hair
so it's an MSI and corsair product they
technically have two different names
there's the MSI version called the
Seahawk which is what we have here and
this is identical to the Corsair version
which is called the hydro graphics or
hydro GFX and the thing that Corsair
contributed here is the liquid cooling
unit so they provide the CLC and that is
an H 55 liquid cooler which is the same
thing you find the CPU market just
basically adapted to a GPU by using
Corsairs hg 10 bracket and that bracket
as seen here has a vrm cooler built into
it which is the blower fan on the front
and it's also got a small heatsink on
top of the actual vrf in terms of
specifications the GTX 980 TI is going
to be the same matter what company you
buy from but the main thing they change
is the cooling unit which in this case
is the H 55 and then of course the clock
rate so for the Seahawk the base clock
rate is eleven ninety megahertz and the
boost clock rate is 1291 megahertz to
put that in perspective the reference
980 TI has built and sold by Nvidia uses
a 1000 mega Hertz base clock and a 1075
megahertz boost clock so quite a big
gain over reference for comparison one
of our favorite cards right now and the
best performing GPU we've tested at
least before this one is the EVGA 980 TI
hybrid also a liquid-cooled card also
using an ASA tech liquid cooling
solution that video card ships at twelve
twenty eight megahertz boost against the
1291 of this card so we should see a
frame rate increase with the Seahawk and
if history is a guide which normally is
the hybrid EVGA hybrid outperformed the
reference card someone considerably in
some games so we'll see if that holds
true here so this video is more of a
comparison between the EVGA hybrid
and the MSI Seahawk or corsair hydro
graphics and that's because you're
probably buying one of the two the EVGA
hybrid is currently priced at seven
hundred and ten dollars but up until
this point it's been seven fifty or 770
the reduction is likely in response to
this which is a 750 dollar video card
available online already so the price
gap is certainly noticeable and it's
enough to potentially influence
decisions let's run through the
differences between the cooling
solutions on the hybrid and on the
Seahawk the primary difference in the
two video card cooling solutions is the
way the cold plate is extruded so with
the EVGA hybrid video card it uses a
copper cold plate with an extruded base
and it's all one unit of copper it's
effectively a unibody piece of copper
and that extruded surface provides a
better and more tuned contact with the
GPU then you'll get with an H 55 cooler
the reason for that is because the CPU
package size and the surface smoothness
of the CPU package is going to be
different than what you find at a GPU
especially when considering the IHS or
the integrated heat spreader on CPUs
doesn't exist on GPUs it's basically
just exposed silicon and you want a
cooler that or a cold plate that can
utilize the direct contact with the
silicon die so that's the main
difference they are both ASA tech
designs and supplies so the tubing is
pretty similar if not the same the braid
is still really nice on the MSI Seahawk
I'm a big fan of the finish on this
tubing and on the radiator the fan it
all works the same way as any other ASA
tech unit would work other differences
include the fan so on the EVGA unit the
fan cord is connected directly to the
video card like that which means that
you can kind of tether it up with the
tubes on this one as you can see the fan
cord is connecting straight to the
motherboard so you're using a three pin
header on the motherboard to connect the
fan and then you can control things that
way through bios so difference there
other than that it's just
LEDs on the fan from corsair there's an
LED up here for MSI and then the
faceplate is quite different as well
EVGA is now shipping a separate
faceplate so what you're seeing here
isn't necessarily what they're shipping
alongside the new 980 TI hybrids if you
do the faceoff upgrade liquid cooling a
video card is actually becoming somewhat
important for the high-end units the big
GPUs and a couple reasons for that the
main ones are items that we discussed in
our fury x review and those would
include obviously reduced overall
thermals substantially in some cases
reduced power leakage from the
capacitors and vrm so that's basically
it improves power efficiency it improves
your efficiency performance per watt and
that's because we're reducing the amount
of power lost through heat so when you
have a hot capacitor it does a worse job
at retaining that power and you have
efficiency loss which increases the heat
of the unit even further so it sort of
builds on itself in the case of liquid
cooling especially the fury X which does
things a bit uniquely by liquid cooling
it's vrm and memory as well with liquid
cooling you're reducing thermals across
everything the liquid isn't in contact
with which in this case is the GPU and
that reduces thermals of the surrounding
components around the GPU like the
capacitors reduces thermals of the vrm
just by nature of putting it under less
load to clean the power so that's a big
deal and that's why liquid cooling is
important on these high on GPUs if
you're doing any kind of overclocking or
putting it under load regularly using
liquid cooling also reduces the chance
of sag so video card sag is something
that msi is familiar with because
they're gaming cards do sag a bit even
with the support backplate and by using
a CLC by mounting a pump to the GPU
you're removing a huge amount of
aluminum and copper both which are very
heavy metals compared to the plastic and
the copper coldplay here so that removes
weight from the card and the heaviest
component the cold plate itself is more
centrally located so the weight
distribution is going to be supported by
the expansion slot in the case
also a good thing let's run through the
tests to see how the two cards compare
and how the Seahawk performs first of
all for temperatures the MSI Seahawk has
a delta t delta temperature over ambient
40 Celsius for the sustain the
equilibrium test and that is up against
a 40 s fury X temperature using a cooler
master CLC and more importantly a much
hotter GPU package and up against the
strict coolers which are very efficient
but you're looking at 960 and 950 here
but more importantly up against the
reference design 980 TI which is in the
60s celsius so that's a 20 Celsius
improvement with a Seahawk card
definitely noticeable and definitely a
big deal for the hybrid though you seen
in the 20s 23 Celsius delta T with the
980 I hybrid by EVGA which is a 19
Celsius difference and that is massive
that's let me make it clear that either
way both of these cards are very high
performing coolers they operate at
temperatures that really the Delta
between them is not going to impact any
gamers any mainstream users even
overclockers will be impacted in a
limited fashion because 40 Celsius is
still pretty cool but it's not as cool
as 23 obviously so moving on from that
we have the power charts this is total
system power this is not individual GPU
power that means it's the requirement
for the entire computer to operate and
with the Seahawk we see a 392 dot 76
watt power draw against the 350 3.5 wat
reference that's an increase of about 40
watts which is really not that bad
considering the clock rate is increased
and if you look at our charts we
compared the clock for clock with the
reference and the hybrid and the Seahawk
and basically it's it's the clock rate
increase and the power percent target
increase that is causing the extra
wattage to be produced here or be
required rather EVGA is at 367
24 the reference model many overclocker
you get closer to the Seahawk moving on
to FPS in-game benchmarks we see
generally about a four to seven percent
gain over the hybrid which is a couple
FPS on average the CLC card to
outperform reference by about eight to
fifteen percent depending on the game so
that is again pretty noticeable and
that's attributable to their pre
overclocked core clock in general the
Seahawks lead is minimal over the hybrid
and could be easily ignored but it is
undeniable that the Seahawk is
objectively and we'll call it first
place for fastest single GPU card on our
benchmark now and that granted it the
best of bench award on the website the
new MSI and Corsair gtx 980 I outmatches
EVGA s hybrid by a single frame per
second in the witcher 3 at 4k which is
just barely outside of margin of error
it's a measured difference and display
consistently through numerous tests
internations but that difference is
still just barely there there is no
denying that the Seahawk is at an
advantage with its increased core clock
and the single frame is totally
unnoticeable the gamers but we can look
at other resolutions and other games to
see how things look there so in the
winter three at 1440 there's a more
measurable difference of four point
eight percent and at 1080p we see a four
point seven percent Delta so not a huge
deal really for either of these cards in
terms of differences they're both very
strong performers in gta5 at 4k which is
a very high load scenario the Seahawk
has a 15-percent advantage over the
reference 92 ti and that becomes more
tangible that's a 10 FPS gain at 1440p
or 12 point nine eight percent so that's
where you start seeing okay now I can
enable different settings and utilize
that a yes for better gameplay better
visuals against the hybrid it's a four
point seven two six point three percent
difference for k and 1440p respectively
favoring the Seahawk again
this advantage is yielded by the faster
clock but you can see in the chart it's
only a couple FPS depending on which
resolution you're at metro last light
shows another five to six percent Delta
between a Maasai and EVGA for the CLC
GPUs and that performance Delta is
favoring MSI once again it's still small
enough to force consideration of other
factors though like cost efficiency of
the cooling solution and obviously what
you're planning to do with the card in
terms of overclocking more benchmarks
are on the website but you can look at a
couple here overclocking is really
important for these cards as well so
looking at the charts you'll see the
steps that I took to produce the highest
achievable clock with our sample big
disclaimer here are two big disclaimers
here one there is a thin that we in the
community called the silicon lottery
which many of you are familiar with that
means this card will not necessarily
overclock the same as other reviewers or
as yours and that's because the GPU is
not the same for every device it is
still the GTX 980 TI GPU the GM 200
series gpus Maxwell GPUs but the actual
performance and the stability of the
silicon will vary from chip two chip so
that noted it's also not necessarily
advised to push the highest possible
clock rate for your card because it will
wear the lifespan down of the card we do
it here for testing because we're just
over clogging to see how well it
performs and it's not being used for
years after that looking at the charts
the Seahawk achieved a 1521 megahertz
poor overclock which is massive over
reference and only a 3846 memory
overclock in terms of frequency so that
was a 300 megahertz offset which is 200
megahertz less than the hybrid and even
the reference 980 TI that we have both
of which achieved a four thousand one
megahertz memory clock I would probably
attribute this to silicon lottery or the
bending process used for the MSI card
because the cooling solution should be
fine so it seems like some kind of
bidding going on where the memory on my
particular card is not as performant as
its
owners but the quarter clock was a seven
ish megahertz gain or the hybrid so that
should produce parity in the FPS tests
and if you look at these you'll see that
the frame rates are now effectively
identical when we look at the
overclocked hybrid and the overclocked
seahawk because their core clock is now
pretty close to the same the big
conclusion is on the website so if
you're a potential buyer and you want
all the details go read that for the
granularity but we'll just go through it
quickly here the EVGA 980 TI hybrid and
the MSI Seahawk also known as the
corsair hydro graphics are the two
directly competing cards on the market
right now in terms of 980 TI's of liquid
cooling so those are the two that you
want to look at if you're buying
something at a seven hundred dollar
range let's liquid cooled and is an eye
a TI this one is 750 dollars the EVGA
solution is currently 710 dollars but
has historically been 752 770 it has
also historically been difficult to get
your hands on although the stock is now
available on new I again so it's it's
finally available so that stated if the
price of the hybrid remains or is
currently at seven hundred and ten
dollars when you're buying that makes it
almost a win immediately unless you're
of a certain group of users as the
prices equalize these two cards will be
in very direct competition and the main
differences here are that and I'll show
a pros and cons table on the website and
we'll throw it up here two main
differences are that the MSI Seahawk
technically outperforms the hybrid and
pure FPS testing if you're not
overclocking at all if you are unwilling
to overclock and you just want to buy
something that gets the best FPS even if
it's only maybe 1 2 3 or 1 25 FPS faster
than the nearest competitor then the
Seahawk is the clear Victor in the
scenario it is the best of bench GPU
that we have tested using the current
generation of video cards or actually
any generation of video cards so that's
certainly impressive if you are willing
to overclock the hybrid from EVGA is
very easily pushed to the 1291 megahertz
stock clock of this one
and can push about the same max
overclock so that makes them achieve
parity makes them effectively identical
in performance if you are willing to do
that extra few minutes of work you feel
comfortable doing that overclock check
our guides if you don't then the hybrid
is again a worthwhile contender to look
at another item to look at is going to
be the overclocking ability we had
issues with memory clocks here but that
does not actually impact your in-game
FPS your real-world performance so in
that regard I would sort of ignore the
memory overclock limitation because we
still got 300 megahertz offset which is
still very noteworthy and the core clock
had no trouble overclock into the same
general area in fact even more than the
EVGA hybrid solution beyond these items
it really comes down to a few things
like do you really want a Corsair and a
Masai branded device in your computer
this is a real thing to consider because
performance wise the hybrid and the
Seahawk are both very good there again
effectively identical so if you want a
branding consistency if you're going for
a theme then your choice is made if you
like the way it looks that's obviously
an important factor as well I'm not
really going to comment on aesthetics
hear what I think about it because I
think that's up to you guys as buyers
not up to me it's not an objective
measurement then do consider the looks
consider that the hybrid is offering
currently a faceoff upgrade thing for an
aluminum faceplate as well so that is
worth noticing and then in terms of
cooling the EVGA hybrid is just flat-out
superior by 19 degrees Celsius and that
is because of the extrusion on the cold
plate it's because of the fan design and
that stated again even the 19 Celsius
gain on the hybrid doesn't put this to
shame this is still sitting at 40
Celsius which is pretty darn cool
especially considering references around
60 Celsius for the 980 TI so either card
is a very cool performer the hybrid will
be the better solution if you are
worried about being thermally limited
for one reason or another
if you're planning on keeping the CLC
and the only real reason I can think of
that would be maybe you're in a already
hot ambient environment if it's like a
hot region that you live in or if you're
worried about chipset heat for some
reason maybe you're pushing a lot of Io
through the chipset and you're utilizing
a lot of those HS i/o lanes that would
cause it to heat up plus the heat of a
video card sitting on top of it would
really not be great for the the chipsets
longevity so that would be a thing to
consider but that's a pretty rare use
case and users who are in that scenario
likely have other things in mind like
open loop cooling so that's all for the
Seahawk again wrapping up this thing is
a very good performance the best
performer on the bench right now it
overclocks very well it's seven hundred
fifty dollars and the EVGA hybrid is
something you should seriously look into
as a competitive competing option both
of them really are not a buy that you
should feel bad about so it's it's kind
of it's impossible to choose the wrong
card other than price if you're limited
on price the choice the bait for you so
