nexus donna and i just got finished
playing ravage what you see here it is a
crazy chaotic game that is it's an FPS
game that is focused on vehicular combat
and runs on the Unreal Engine the
developers were kind enough to play with
us and a few other media outlets so what
you are about to watch is some footage
from that play session so you will hear
a couple of other other members of the
media in there with us and just listen
in to hear about the game watch for some
gameplay and enjoy yourself is pretty
sweet i'm excited about it and we will
have more coverage of this as time goes
on so stay tuned to the channel with
that i will let the footage play and
enjoy yes the driving is personally i
think we got a nice balance of infantry
and depriving but the driving it
definitely what makes this game a lot
different I mean there's a lot of
first-person shooter games out there but
the way the vehicles handle in this game
and how we implemented and how the
action is core happening around the
vehicles is it's not seen before I
haven't seen it before and how is a was
a lot of that already-existing an unreal
engine or did you guys have to do a lot
of custom work um that's a good question
i'm not so familiar with that but I
can't say that some of the things our
earth from the developers is that they
had to make a lot of programming
themselves well what role do you play it
the company I have the community venture
community manager that the vehicle is
it's a nice experience in this game it's
it's different than ah yeah lots of
chaos yes control gas so
I'm an odd thing is more yeah I'm trying
to I'm gonna try kill some of you here
yeah you know every time it's not a it's
not fun to kill you because every time I
do you're busy talking or explaining
something I've been through that the
last oh no what just odd this is a bad
stuff and but anyway guys and I can do a
short introduction of the game if you
feel like it what happened is this the
earth got hit by solar flares it put the
world into chaos so you also see maps
not only being desert it will also have
maps that are focused on some you know
like ice maps because the world simply
turn around so what is actually
happening now is that we got two sides
fighting each other all the resources
there's left which is not a lot and the
one faction we got is the fashion
culture resistance they are this former
civilizations law enforcement the
schoolteachers other than a civilized
the people who right now are trying to
rebuild the community and you know gets
back to to to what the world was once
even though the circumstances really bad
so I did you know the resources they
gathered they share it with other people
and and really just basic just trying to
build up community again and then the
scavengers who are the the past world's
hardcore criminals murderers the
prisoners cons ex-cons who are basically
thinking more about living to the day
after or how you say it so whatever
resource they find if they're gonna keep
it for himself and you know everyone who
is trying to whoever is in their way
they were just you know kill him you'll
probably also noticed that
the class is the anti vehicle classes on
both sides The Bodyguard on the
scavengers and their weapons specialist
on the resistance they their rocket
launchers are you need to in order to
kill a guy either it or to kill a guy
you need to hit and straight on
otherwise you need to shoot oh nice okay
okay so the game of your praying right
now is capture the resource some of you
guys probably know capture the flag from
traditional Unreal Tournament
traditional capture the flag we modified
that bit we put in two resources one on
each side both of them can be captured
at the same time so basically you need
to defend your resource while you have
to capture the opponent's resource or
your team has have to also there will be
vehicles at those capture points that
you can use so the capture points are
for gaining and tactical advantage both
offense and you know the other thing
that tank is a little overpowered
actually the tank is this yeah it's
meant to take out vehicles and but
against infantry is actually not that
easy to use and it's okay it's slow this
one seems pretty stocks I need to
destroy that
Thanks the other day I was driving one
of the one person ATVs and someone
jumped on top of me oh and and he didn't
fall off so we were just driving around
with him on top of me as a gun fantastic
you know what's cool about this also for
competitive gaming that we also want to
support competition like eight vs eight
I don't know if you guys know al LG ESL
yeah yeah yeah so do you have any sports
plans then yes we're reaching out to
them we are we got a pretty good demo
recording a lot them across sorry
spectator mode right now it needs some
polish though but the free cam is
working amazingly we still play with
that a little bit silly yeah we did some
work on the third person and the first
person but due to the ancient we're not
sure that we can make a third person is
our first person worked perfectly but
the third person we should be able to
polish to make it work better than it is
right now cool so that adoption of
offers the opportunity to for the games
to be live streaming on Twitch to be you
know with commentators which you know
gets a lot of an engineer well is there
a replay system that you're looking at
or yes we actually is the system we've
got a demo recorder but it's not going
to fit in for release it needs some
tweaking but it's definitely something
that we are looking into adding it to
the game in the future and we are still
discussing pick back and forth whether
it's going to be a server-side recording
tool like you probably saw have seen in
Delta too much more is going to be a
client-side demo recording meaning that
you as a player can also write something
like reports and then you'll be
reporting yourself first
resources and yes not a match that will
be part f as patch media so you simply
upload your meds media to but every
tournament side you're playing on so
people can review it and make sure you
are not cheating cool yeah it's good to
see more developers I mean begin
development with eSports and recording
in mind he's down I'm a former you smoke
player I played the bell field play for
the danish national team and some of the
best teams in Europe and so that's well
I I you know I hard lies it you know I
tried to push a lot for the eSport the
features and that was actually before I
got hired and they're like yeah okay we
add it and I say okay Rosen you know I
needs picture but now okay and they
added it then a couple weeks after I got
hired so that's cool these guys were
listening from the start where they do
you know who the fuck I work I mean I
sought out just being where how about
I'll chest in the game so that's pretty
cool % I think it's there x percent yeah
something like that i'm not sure though
but ya did that take a a piece of the
cake for sure on a website we are
actually you know they people can also
buy the game from our website that means
they will support us directly but we
also offering clamp packs since we want
this game to be a play with your friends
and you know invite your community or
clan to this game we created something
called a clam pack basically where we
get for game keys instead of it cuts
twenty-five dollars each it's gonna cost
you on its fifteen dollars each so you
save like 40 bucks that's cool will you
have well you have any clan systems in
place to facilitate that or any you know
well ways to organize the community yes
our website you can create the groups um
you can call it a bit like the better
lock but you know not that advanced yet
but you can really glitchy hopefully
that
you can create groups and you can create
events within that group have a calendar
and you can in turn forum but it's
something that we're still working on
but at the moment you can definitely
create the groups and you can also
create events so you can do like okay
guys let's meet on Friday people can
jump in there and sign up for that date
and everybody can meet at home is it
possible to snipe people when they're in
the vehicle or sometimes their head is
poking up like yes sir it yes you can
kill people on the in the vehicles by
shooting them simply yeah it's about
that one I was trying the driving the
muscle car the hot rod for the
scavengers and I have full car that
means free guys at the back and wanting
to gun the turret and I flipped the car
and the guys in the fact if default they
fell out the cool so I don't go back and
pick them up there like a give me give
me right you know he'll this guy's they
were there just a second ago and that
was like in the biggest map with the
lone dancer and I mean there there would
be no sense for them to jump out by
themselves so I had to go back and pick
him up you're far too kind of a teammate
I would have left them to die yeah it's
like a guy sorry we don't have enough
water oh so I was the fittest I think
I'm too used to borderlands 2 where you
can do anything to a vehicle and safer
getting hit by a rocket and it won't
blow up you can just jump off you know
Oh am sitter 50 feet in the air into a
brick wall and it'll still be up to the
to those bikes have the vehicles been a
focal point of development it seems like
that's kind of kind of the game stain um
I'm not sure but yeah I believe I mean
the vehicles is a huge pot so yeah yeah
how many people are on the team we got a
daily team off I would say something
like eight guys and five of those are
developers to them are taking care of
the website and then there's me but they
can be
management we also use the freelancers
and contractors resources so we
outsource some stuff but the daily team
is about those eight guys but we've been
using probably something close to 50
guys in total within those three years
oh I'm in the air is that you in Cairo
yeah oh I see you that's pretty good
everybody better watch it haha I'm gonna
rain Hellfire rain Hellfire soon hey
it's coming haha be just what i'm saying
is what is watching you can't rush it
it's a slow process resources it's a bad
habit to immediately go for the most
difficult thing the kid it's just a
little in it i don't know if you guys
been up to the torch often place you can
actually go all the way up to village
it's very twisted metal ass I so you can
actually get on the tour yes you can oh
I guess I'm going on an expedition then
yeah I could tell you guys sometimes it
looks kind of ridiculous but sometimes
you can actually see like 34 sniper
sitting up there you know fighting for
that small space and you actually see
sometimes it happens that it's other guy
too you know he's scoping at the same
time but he the guy promised keeps going
in his view so he tries to step up into
the left but then he falls off and you
can just see people dropping you know
like flies from that the torture and so
hilarious sometimes director or but yeah
everyone take out multiple roles I would
say well after we got
lissa boles 20 it just went into
overtime I just I decided to jump off
the torch cuz I thought the game was
about to end so I jumped off the torch
with one second left oh I don't want to
hit over time when I died yeah yeah you
can collect you send some message to
that guy who just finished that round
you could just hit Jake you are we here
I love to the place figures fun to just
sit there and you know fuck you and you
know as The Laughing of those people
thing is funny so we decided to keep
that in fucking it's a small favor but
it's still something that makes the play
laugh and we put a we did to the
cooldown on because Pilcher's arf arf
arf arf arf are you know so they can't
told his parents why would you take that
away that's such a cool person I thought
it was awesome I was you know the fun
part I was probably the reason why they
decided to remove it but I it was weak
because I was sitting there present at
jakey constantly because I was just
laughing my ass off I was like a
five-year-old kid thinking that was the
most fun thing ever resources a couple
more questions from the shads will there
be any native flight stick support for
the helicopters ah it's a great question
that's that's actually a really good
question that I know it's very popular
that's I think it's again it's a matter
of time and resource if you could do
will definitely add it uh what you think
on the line fuck buddy actually can't do
you can actually play this game with
your xbox patrol oh I think yeah I bet
the night at the flying is really really
good with uh with a stick
I should try bugles drivers of vehicles
mr. are you working now I can hook it up
now you should go get it I'm it's one
hundred percent polished but then we
have developments testing out famous
last night and he said that this is
fucking great when firing so it's gonna
be okay with drought as yeah I'm not
that I stopped into the hillside again
