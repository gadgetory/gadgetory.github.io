dotnet and we're talking out and these
new Radeon Settings crimson edition
software today this is a big deal for
AMD for the last couple of reviews now
the major thing we've complained about
with AMD GPUs has been their driver and
software support so if you look back in
history for us go to about June for the
r9 380 and r9 390 reviews and in that
review that joint review we basically
condemned the two cards for poor driver
support and said we wouldn't recommend
it because of flickering screens and
other issues driver crashes things like
that those were later resolved which
changed our stance a bit but we were
still kind of iffy on the driver support
overall then the fury X came out
reviewed that and we said that the
drivers hamstrung and these fury X and
Fiji architecture so again a Dane
against Andy for driver and software
support as time went on we reviewed the
390 X in August and for that card we
said that the drivers were critically
improved and felt a lot more comfortable
recommending the device going forward
but we were still a little unsure
because of some spurious behavior that
we saw finally with the 380 X about two
weeks ago I wrote in my review that I
was confident in recommending and the
the website itself gamers Nexus all of
our staff were fairly confident in
recommending the 380 X on its driver
support because it's it's improved a lot
so and these taking steps in the right
direction and Radeon settings is a
furthering of that so we're here to
review Radeon settings which is the new
software suite this is a utility that is
replacing catalyst control center or CCC
has been around for quite a while maybe
even back to the ATI days and CCC is
being retired it will be no more when
you install your drivers now you'll have
the option to select Radeon settings or
select as as it is now the CCC suite I
don't know if that'll be continued going
forward it seems like they'll kind of
phase that out and just only do Radeon
settings but for now that's what's
present so and these Radeon settings is
a minimalistic approach to the driver
packaged and it's basic it's not a
driver itself
it is an application used for accessing
and driver information used for cleanly
uninstalling drivers there's a new
bundled application for that so you
don't have to go to used edu which is
what we use for our display driver
removers in between tests and the big
thing here is a performance increase so
with CCC the load time was a little bit
slower and the install time was
certainly slower and these numbers
internally project this and then we did
some of our own validation and found
similar results with the install time
alone not that this is too critical
because how many times you're really
gonna install drivers but it does show
that they have cleaned up the packaging
a little bit then install time alone
we're seeing about 86 seconds for Radeon
settings and that is when you include
the and the Raptor Gaming evolves
software which I'm not a fan of and I've
said that publicly a few times now but
it's part of it so if you include it
then it's 86 seconds if you remove it
it's about 15 seconds faster the Radeon
settings utility is currently in our
press version 1.1 gigabytes and the 15
dot 11.1 drivers without Radeon settings
is about 470 mega bytes give or take 1
megabyte the reason for that disparity
I'm pretty sure is because the Radeon
Settings package we have bundles all of
the windows versions support for all the
versions support for all the cards so it
makes it easier in that you have one
thing to download for everything but it
makes it larger obviously and I'm not
sure how they're gonna differentiate
that on the website or if they're just
gonna do one package but it is a bit
bigger but it installs faster and the
boot up time is much faster as well so
you now see a boot up time of less than
one second when launching radeon
settings' it's a really good thing and
he's done very well in that department
and that makes it a bit faster then CCC
depending on how you run the numbers but
either way less than a second to boot it
up and then other features like I
affinity have improved in their speed as
well so now I affinity has a one-click
quick setup button that you can use to
immediately detect locate and setup your
multi display device configurations a
couple of things here talking about
performance metrics that you'll see from
AMD
other sites today and about the driver
support going forward so again Radeon
settings is a software suite in terms of
driver support this is 15 dot 11.1 beta
it is not a new driver package and it's
just adding the software to fifteen dot
11.1 replacing ccc that means that when
you see charts from AMD claiming a
twenty percent performance gain over the
previous drivers what they're referring
to as 15.7 dot one which is really kind
of old at this point and that's a lot
different from saying fifteen dot 11.1
which is the one everyone's been using
recently especially with battlefront and
fallout and black ops three and every
other game that's come out recently you
need fifty nine 11.1 to get good
performance so you probably already have
it which means you will see no
performance and gain in terms of gaming
FPS from installing this crimson
software and that's something i really
disagree with andy's presentation of
data there i disagree that it is a good
thing or a realistic thing to say that
there's a twenty percent performance
improvement because the asterisk cannon
next to that number indicates that are
talking about fifteen thousand 7.1 which
realistically not very many people are
using at this point or at least not
anyone watching this channel who stays
on top of things like hardware news and
drivers and things like that this is
something that nvidia has done in the
past as well so I can't really ding them
too hard but I just it's a zero percent
performance gain basically as how I
would present it but the important thing
here that Andy is doing well is they've
promised six wickel driver updates per
year and that means that they're
certified their Microsoft certified for
Windows so they're not just beta drivers
and that's a lot more than recently they
had I think about three this year and
that's better still than the previous
second half of 14 2014 that first half
of 2015
where there were zero driver updates for
I think it was like 180 days so Andy's
trending in the right direction and this
new six week old driver updates per year
if they can stick to it through 2016 is
going to be a big deal for them
especially with improving their game
ready Daewon launch driver support
something that they've started to catch
up with recently but still straggled on
some games like
four and overall they they are trending
in the correct direction for their
driver support and frequency of launches
so the review part of this content is
really just talking about all of the
performance data that we've already
given you in terms of the boot up time
load time stuff like that but we're also
here to run through the major updates
and items in crimson software or Radeon
settings or Radeon software it's it's
had a lot of names and to talk about
those names the versioning works like
this there is first Radeon settings is
the name as I understand it now
that's the name of the software package
then you see crimson edition in this
case and crimson edition is it's a shade
of red for all crimson andy says they
will continue using shades of red
different ones for every major iteration
of the software effectively at one point
of a 2.0 a three point of a type of
thing andy says that they want to do one
of these per year so you'll have one new
shade of red per year and then after
that there's a number identifiers like
the existing fifteen dot eleven or
similar items but it's basically just a
year dot month so that's how that words
we've got it explained in the article if
that went by too quickly the other major
things here just checking my notes from
our written review would be the test
case automation and manual testing andy
has added one hundred percent more
automated test cases to try and improve
the drivers they've added 25 percent
more manual test cases and a test case
is basically I have a lot of them on the
sheet actually for our own testing a
test case is when you have a number of
steps to run through something that
could create a problem so you run
through functionality a test engineer
designs a test case a technician will
execute it and then they try to find
where are the problems with the software
so Andy's added a lot more of those
that's a good thing one thing that I
really like is the per game overclocking
so you can set profiles per game if you
say if you need four fps and fallout 4
so you're heading 56 and you really want
60 but you can't quite get it but maybe
an overclock pushes you there because
that that is within realistic range of
overclocking to get a couple extra yes
so you could set a profile to only
overclock for Fallout 4 which is a good
thing because we generally advise
against running permanent long term
overclock in profile
on your card for everything and idle use
and every day is because it really just
beats up the silicon and it's not good
for the card so you can do per game
profiles for overclocking that is a big
plus and then there's a global
application of game settings if you want
to set settings for your games through
software rather than through the game
for some reason that's not something I
really care to do I don't do a GeForce
experience and I won't do it with this
but you can do that globally or if you
install ambe's raptor suites then you
can do it per game individually and set
all the settings there I really don't
like the gaming evolved app it's slow it
doesn't work well on high resolutions
doesn't scale properly it's it feels
kind of bloated and that is the opposite
of how I feel about the Crimson edition
Radeon settings right now software suite
it's the opposite of bloated it's
actually very lean and quick and agile
and that's something that the gaming
evolved app is not so I would opt to not
install that on personal computers if I
weren't testing it everything
significantly faster usability is
improved for new users CPU consumption I
saw at about 3% max I never saw more
than that and that was when actively
using the software was closer to 1 or 0
when it was in the background and memory
consumption was about 180 megabytes max
so overall this is really a pretty good
move for AMD the driver is or the
software I should say is well designed
is well built it is fast it is clean all
these things I know that perhaps the
major point of criticism won't come from
users who are used to CCC and feel like
this is a dumbing down of their input as
a technical user and that is certainly
true there is a bit of it removes a bit
of the advanced technical feel when you
eliminate all these sort of nested sub
menus what actually Heather its but
that's an old messy way to do it and the
industry is moving away from that CCC is
still being sort of adapted into crimson
it's still being consumed by it
eventually I would expect to see all of
the options there but most of them are
presently there and what's lacking you
can launch a CCC window and access them
the old-fashioned way I am pretty happy
with this overall I would suggest
downloading it if you have AMD if you
have problems with it let us know
because I didn't really see any major
problems but I
I tested it on what a hardware
configuration and you can read what that
was on the website so that's all for
this time check the patreon link in the
post or video after this video ends and
thank you for watching we really enjoy
making the content as I've said it's a
lot of fun to do this stuff just
upgraded to a table and and that's
because of the viewership and because
you guys are sharing all the content and
we much appreciate that so thanks for
