difference between shader count and
vegam 56 and Vega 64 where 56 host 3584
shaders and 64 host 4096 that's a 14
percent increase in shader count to be
64 but the gains aren't linear we were
able to cross Vega 64 reference
performance with our heavily modded Vega
56 card and that was done using power
play tables and liquid to jump to 17 42
megahertz clock speeds by going less
crazy about overclocking and limiting
clocks to match speeds we can reveal the
importance of shader count or lack
thereof before that this coverage is
brought to you by the core G 21
enclosure from thermal take a $70 case
with 2 4 millimeter thick tempered glass
side panels and a power supply shroud
with top mounted SSD sleds learn more at
the link in the description below and
given that we now have about 1% of the
Vega 56 cards that have shipped to the
US there's another one in the test bench
in the other room it seems like a good
time to run this test so the biggest
issue with the benchmark is that AMD's
newest cards vega cards use a similar
boost functionality to Nvidia's pascal
line so it's it's more or less
equivalent to boost 3.0 and that means
that the clock speed jumps up and down
based on various parameters those
include power thermals voltage things
like that and basically determines on
its own if it has enough Headroom and
either one in any of those parameters to
boost clock further or if it needs to
drop clock down so that makes it
difficult to do a clock for clock
comparison but we can control for it if
long as you're careful and measure
everything while testing things like
that so the big pin here unfortunately
that is a difficulty the upside is that
theoretically these boost parameters
with Andy and NVIDIA mean that out of
box without any overclocking or any user
interaction whatsoever the card should
more or less be performing at their
maximum potential within all of the
various parameters defined for safe
operation so that's the idea of it but
it does make the job of overclocking
more difficult so we have controlled for
that and we've solved for power Headroom
Thermal headroom and more or less
voltage we ended up clocking up to
around 1590
megahertz on both cards for that
frequency bounced around based on the
game with vegam 56 and 64 cards we
applied power offsets of 80% with power
play tables just to ensure there was no
power limit issue and then we imposed a
1.2 v core which was checked on the back
of the card with a digital multimeter
HBM two speeds were set to nine forty
five megahertz on each card meaning that
we've brought the V 56 up to be 64 stock
memory speeds and so we're really just
looking at two cards that have the same
speeds the same voltage very similar
power limits and the only difference now
is the shader count will show some
frequency comparisons on the screen now
while talking through this next part we
ended up retesting this three different
times thanks to the new clock behavior
in Vega the final two tests logs
frequency for each test and each game
which was new for us and then we checked
those averaged frequencies and frequency
over time for each test this allowed us
to better determine if the clocks were
actually roughly matched or if one card
had more boosting Headroom than the
other obviously we want as little
movement as possible in the clock the
Vega 64 card often needed to be set to
around 1632 megahertz to get 1590
megahertz in some games for example
which can make things confusing and
other games like ashes would be was
higher than we configured so the only
solution was logging and manually
checking it we ultimately ended up with
a range of about 2 to 10 megahertz
difference for most tests generally
sticking around 2 megahertz and this in
mind our margin of error is going to be
a little wider than previously with
perfectly matched speeds but to be fair
2 megahertz is generally 0.1% different
so not a big deal the biggest deal is
that if it boosts higher and one
scenario than another you might see that
reflected but the best solution is just
to control and testing some other games
we're a bit more variable than this but
we've got all that data let's start with
3dmark firestrike here's the clock
comparison chart for 3dmark fire strike
at 1080p as seen here we're roughly
equal in clocks averaging the frequency
during actual tests though not between
tests that doesn't matter we ended up at
1580 5.6 megahertz for Vega 64 and 50
83.5 for bacon 56 or 0.1% offset that's
close enough to be effectively the
same averaged our graphics score for
Vegas 64 lands at 2276 one with v56 at
22 7 to 4 and that's a difference of 0.1
6% which coincides with our clock speed
deficit on Vega 56 and as well within
margin of test variance on 3dmark
applications the scores are effectively
the same between B 56 and V 64 when
matching clock speeds showing no
advantage for higher shader count on
Vega 64 to put those scores into
perspective here are the FPS scores 100
11.3 for Vega 64 100 and 11.2 7 for
bacon 56 looking at GT 1 GT 2 puts us at
89 9 and 80 8.854 64 and 56 respectively
though it doesn't really matter which
order they are at this point just to
make sure there's not some major
advantage in higher resolutions we
tested a few games at both 1080p and 4k
here's the clock chart for for honor
where we see effectively equal clocks
the average clock for Vega 64 was
fifteen seventy eight five megahertz
with bacon 56 at 1580 dot four megahertz
sticking to our 0.1% difference at 4k we
fall within our error margins and tested
test variance they can fit these six
technically plots higher but this is a
statistically insignificant difference
that lead could just be because Vega 56
happened to hit a higher clock and a
more abusive scene or maybe something
slightly different happened on screen
during that particular test pass there's
no statistically significant difference
in for honor at 4k between these two
cards when they are clock matched at
1080p we see similarly in significant
differences we're at roughly 137 FPS
average for each GPU the shaders provide
no clear advantage in any of our three
measured metrics hell-blade at 4k and
very high had both the vega 56 and vega
64 cards at around 34 FPS average with
low is similarly matched in this
particular test there is not an
advantage from increased shader count
from the way we tested or measured at
1080p we see the same we're at about 81
FPS average for each GPU so once again
no real difference from the shader count
ashes of the singularity with dx12 and
GPU focus testing lands an average V 64
frequency of 1600
six megahertz with v56 averaging 15 98.9
megahertz so about one different close
enough measured performance has vega 64
at 58 FPS average with vega 56 at 56.7
FPS average this is close enough to be
within our error tolerances for this
particular test especially because Ashes
does kind of jump around a bit and
framerate lows are largely the same so
no real difference here Ghost Recon
wildlands at 4k had Vega 56 and 64 both
operating at 42 FPS average with lows
between 37 and 38 1% and roughly between
36 and 37 fps 0.1% low is 1080p wasn't
much different we saw largely the same
performance once again with this test as
with all the others there might be
applications where the shader difference
is more noticeable but it's not in any
of these games maybe in some kind of
production application or something we
didn't catch there's a possibility
there's a bigger advantage there but for
the games we've tested which serve as an
analog for all games
hopefully although there are always
outliers we controlled for a frequency
on the core controlled for frequency on
HBM controlled for thermals for power
target controlled for voltages and
checked carefully on the back of the
card and performance in gaming is
effectively the same once we equalize
for all of those things and we only have
the one difference being shader count or
CU count if you prefer so this further
sort of puts the nail in the coffin for
Vega 64 for gaming as we've said since
the start Vega 56 is more or less well
so here's the thing with the pricing
situation now what I'm going to do is
rather than reference any specific price
numbers we're gonna just reference them
relative to each other if they get 56
can stick near the 10 70s price it has
been and still is a pretty good buy it
is and these strongest argument for the
Vega line 56 competes rather directly
with the 1070 where 64 just doesn't make
a lot of sense in terms of value and the
biggest downside is the boosted power
consumption on 56 versus the 1070 so
that's not of concern to you there's not
a lot of a downside there if you are
looking at overclocking 56
definitely is worth buying over
sixty-four there's one potential
downside which is that there might be a
case where Vega 56 is binned is a lower
bin of HBM than 64 in that case you
would be more limited but so far I've
only heard of one card personally that
can't reach 945 mega HBM to speed and
that one was hitting 930 but in theory
you should be okay with the ones we've
tested it boosts high enough with an
overclock maybe not as high as 64 but
it's still pretty good and either way
you can hit 64 performance ignoring the
shader difference with gaming that we've
tested so looking good there the only
real reason Vega 56 would underperform
versus Vega 64 is the power limit 56
comes with a lower TDP allowance in its
stock bios than Vega 64 which is Andy's
way of limiting the power permitted to
the core and the HBM and everything so
your overclocks will be more limited on
56 than 64 however that can be solved
you can solve it with a registry table
or as we've recently learned you can
solve it by flashing a be 64 air BIOS
onto a V 56 and as long as you don't
modify that BIOS it'll work it won't
work if you make any modifications it
won't work if you take VF EE but 64 on
56 works and the most critical thing
there is that it unlocks a higher power
limit so you can do everything you want
to deal with 56 within whatever Silicon
lottery may apply so as for the shaders
it looks like there's not a big
difference in the games be tested again
there might be an application where it
matters but it's not in these games and
these games largely serve as an analogue
for other games so fair to say Vega 56
remains a far better buy than Vega 64
and remains competitive with a 1070
particularly if you actually tap into
its overclocking head room and start
doing some modding so as always thank
