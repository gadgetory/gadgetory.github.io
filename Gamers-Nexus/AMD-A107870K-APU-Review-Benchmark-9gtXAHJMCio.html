dotnet and today were talking about
AMD's 810 7870 ka pu this is the new apu
that's been a refresh to the 7850 k so
this is sort of familiar to their recent
are 300 series refresh of the are 200
series in that it's not an architectural
update to the existing Kaveri platform
but it enhances it by doing a couple of
things like clock rate increases and
that's really primarily where the
changes with the eight ten seven eight
seventy K so a couple of things and then
we'll jump into the specs and bench
market and all that the 810 78 70 K is
generally priced at about $150 on Amazon
or other retailers online I've seen it
for $120 there is a one-day sale where
you hit that low so that is something
we'll keep in mind during the conclusion
but at 150 that's what you should expect
to pay for it on average so jumping
straight into the specs here the a10
7870 k is an AMD APU that means it has
integrated graphics on it unlike the
athlon x4 series which effectively takes
these chips and disables the IGP
component so the integrated graphics
uses an r7 graphics processor and with
AMD CPUs that takes about 50% of the die
so it's really quite a lot of the total
die size is dedicated to the IGP and
four other specs the 7870 K is
effectively identical to the 7850 K
except for clock rate so it's got four
CPU cores eight GPU cores it uses r7
graphics and the 7870 K is a four point
one gigahertz turbo clock and 3.9
gigahertz base and the 70 50 K is 4.0
and 3.7 so that's a point one difference
on the turbo and point two difference on
the base clock and then it's got the
same cache four megabytes of l2 but the
GPU is overclocked actually somewhat
reasonably it goes to eight 66 megahertz
from 720 megahertz on the 7850 K so that
is a fairly reasonable overclock that is
more than 100 megahertz that's 146
megahertz OC on the GPU component the
a-10 70 is 70 K APU is an FM 2 plus
socket at
sugar goes into fm2 plus boards and it
also uses the Kaveri platform so that
means the same chipsets associated with
Kaveri eight views and the Richland and
Kaveri CPUs will be used here so that
would be a Dax at the high end for your
primary chipset that allows for
overclocking and crossfire SLI things
like that
this apu is on the same nomenclature
that Andy launched a number of years ago
the bulldozer piledriver steamroller
initiative it's using the steamroller
architecture and steamroller advanced
AMD is positioning for IPC and single
threaded performance which is something
that bulldozer and piledriver were
really not very good at so steamroller
did advance those things this is all
kind of old news at this point we're
just recapping what's happened up till
now and AMD's steamroller architecture
is still very much an arithmetic and
integer powered arc it's much better at
arithmetic processing and compute and
this remains true with their GPUs as
well if you look at the Fiji
architecture it's really quite
impressive for compute it has a huge
shader array and that's something we
discuss in the fury X review if you're
curious what all that is about so that
continues with the AP use but that means
that they're not necessarily inherently
that great at gaming so that's what
we're benchmarking here we're trying to
see a few things one at what point does
the CPU component of the 7870 cave
bottleneck when we couple it with a high
end GPU or mid-range GPU and to how well
do the integrated graphics perform for
gaming so that would include csgo and
dota testing at the low end and then
three we coupled the competing
processors at a very low price point
with an appropriate dedicated or
discrete GPU solution D GPU so that
would be the G three to five eight at
$65 plus the $96 now deprecated r7 250x
and the seven sixty K which has been
replaced by the 860 K which is a $75
processor coupled with the same r7 250x
so those two solutions are ten to twenty
dollars more than the 7870 K which is
becoming a decent jump at the twenty
dollar more price point that would be
the AMD solution but the Intel
is only $10 more and is something that
we'll investigate as an alternative
let's dive into the benchmarks here and
see how the apu performs we're going to
start with the IGP performance using the
art 7 graphics processor the 78 70 K
isn't that bad at csgo on Ultra or dota
2 on medium settings this is about where
the 70 at so many K's GPU belongs for
performance and it's not great but it's
certainly playable at about 60 fps or a
little more in some cases and that said
the 780 Tony K is rapidly outpaced by
the CPU plus d GPU solutions by nearly
2x in GTA 5 the G 3 2 5 8 looks playable
at an average FPS of more than 70 in
some instances but has a dismal 0.1% low
of 4 that makes for a jarring and
unpleasant experience this is exactly
why we test frame time variants and in
this instance you're going to want to
opt for the slower average FPS and the
760 K + d GPU solution over the g3 - 5/8
strictly because of this performance at
0.1% lows and that is a threading issue
looking at CPU performance only by
coupling a 980ti with the CPUs we see
where GPU bottlenecks exist in certain
games on the cpus the 78 Sony K is
outpaced readily by the 41 60 which is
actually a cheaper CPU at $117 and to
this end if you're buying mid-range or
higher-end GPUs and coupling them with a
mid $100 CPU for instance it makes
better sense to buy an i3 or cheap I 5
then the 78 70 K the 78 70 K is just not
designed to be used as a CPU exclusive
solution you're basically throwing out
50% of the die immediately that's
dedicated to graphics because you're
replacing it with something
significantly better
that can't be coupled using and these
dual graphics architecture the 78 70 K
does well in one place and one place
only and that is with games like csgo
dota and mole and if you're playing any
one of those games you actually get
about a 2x performance increase by
opting for AMD
zone 760 or 860 k+ d GPU now that is a
ten to twenty dollar jump in price so
that is certainly of note if that's
absolutely unaffordable then the sony at
sony k is really not bad at low end
games like csgo dota and all but in
general it's going to worth spending the
extra at least ten to twenty because you
get a huge gain in graphics performance
you're going to be able to play other
games like GTA 5 on normal where the 70
at 70 K would not be able to tolerate
those games without a G GPU on its own
to this end there are only a few primary
use cases for the 78 70 K and those
would be in foreign markets where the
price disparity is much different and in
the Asian market I know the 78 Sony K is
priced much differently and potentially
more affordable I'm really not familiar
with that market that is one target that
AMD could be going after and the second
the use case would be in odd unique form
factor builds where you're building in
an enclosure that doesn't even allow for
a GP of any kind it doesn't have any
expansion slots and a few of those boxes
exist
Silverstone makes a few they're
basically HTPC boxes that resemble a DVR
and don't even have room for ad GPU but
a lot of them at this point do they just
rotate the GP and use a an expansion
slot that extends to the GP wherever it
is so it's an interesting market the
7870 K is not particularly good against
the competition but it is fairly
impressive from a graphic standpoint
stand alone so the csgo dota and mobile
performance are all very good you can
play all those games on the 7870 K in
general we would strongly advise
builders who are using a tight budget to
investigate the option of an 860 k plus
the d GPU at the low end rather than a
787 TK if you absolutely can't afford
that $20 the g 3 to 5 8 is not a bad
consideration just keep in mind that the
0.1% lows on the Intel g3 2 5 8
dual-core processor are pretty bad in
some games like GTA that are heavily
multi-threaded but in those games
generally the 78 70 K would not be a
good performer at
so that's another thing to keep in mind
so if Andy drops the price more
permanently to about $120 which is where
we saw it during a brief sale online
then it becomes a much more viable
platform it's it's something that is
much easier to recommend because at 120
you have now a thirty to forty dollar
price gap at some ends between the DGP
plus CPU solutions and that begins to
put your build into another price
category altogether so 120 if you see it
for that and you're trying to save a lot
of money and build something that
basically exists only to play games like
dota and csgo and maybe do your media
management like a TV HD PC or something
then this is an OK processor to consider
but in any other use case very heavily
consider the option of D GPU + CPU and
even AMD zone 860 K is better with a DGP
than this solution so it's not like
we're saying just by Intel because
that's not the case here so that is all
