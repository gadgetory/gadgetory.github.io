dotnet we're here at GDC 2016 this is
our final coverage of the show and we're
joined by torn banner talking about
Mirage before getting to this content
all of the coverage is brought to you by
raw Furies a goner platformer game which
you can see on the screen now so Steve
you worked on way back on age of
chivalry right and then chivalry
medieval warfare what's who who can give
me a top level of Mirage here well
chivalry was basically medieval combat
it was about sword fighting right and
Mirage is kind of a spiritual successor
to chivalry in a certain sense where it
still has that sword fighting at its
core but on top of that we've added in
magic combat we've really integrated
those systems together so that it
actually hopefully feels like a sword
fight from 20 feet away and what I mean
by that is that you can block every
projectile every every action and it's
all reactable gameplay that still feels
like you're dueling people very cool and
Alex what's the thing that you most look
forward to telling people about with
mirage what sort of the thing i think
you think gets people hooked immediately
i think it really all comes down to the
combat and the mechanic we built into it
that you know players of sugary will
really be reminded of is know that the
strength of the melee combat and just
how focus is on having control just like
in sugary over your weapon but now we're
adding that into magic casting so you
know you can you can block any magic
attack from afar and you can also read
combat scenarios in the same way that
you could and our last game but it
becomes that much more crucial when
these magic you know massive magical
spells are coming across the screen
blowing people's bodies in the
smithereens becomes so exciting and so
much of a bra you know almost emotional
experience to play the game right and so
that's actually something I want to talk
about on the design side when we were
talking pre interview here it sounds
there's a real commitment to psychology
with game design so talking about this
idea of telegraphing attacks what what
does Telegraph in an attack mean well
what it means is a bit it means making
the gameplay reactable which means that
we want to promote counter play so that
I have to pay very close attention to
what you're doing what we're really
talking about is making it about human
beings fighting it's missing magic to do
that but we still want it to feel like a
very personal martial arts inspired kind
of calm
one of the things we like to say is
we're almost kind of taking some of the
fighting game mechanics and bringing
that into an FPS multiplayer experience
and the mechanics here so for mirage
there are how many abilities and and how
do we use them in the game so yeah
there's a there's six different
character classes that you play as in
the game and each class is really built
according to a different play style and
each character class has got three
different slots that they can fit a
variety of different spells into so
ranging from defensive spells to evasive
spell just spells that will literally
tear your body in half there's no does a
variety of different ways to play with
magic in the game and it's magic also
that has a real force to it which is
something we're really trying in mirage
is Magic that doesn't feel like fairy
dust you know this is going to this is
like throwing a brick at someone's face
when you kill them and it's going to
really feel so satisfying when you get
into a really skill-based duel with
someone and you finish that duel by rag
dolling them across the screen and just
seeing that at work it's really
satisfying and one of the cool things we
saw on that front was in the demo you
had a guy doing sort of a death from
above attack on a group of three
clustered players and it looked like
there was sort of a physics interaction
there what could you describe everyone
what was going on what was the setup
sure yeah well one of the things that
makes players feel powerful in the game
is that they're actually able to combo
their abilities together so what we saw
in that instance was someone leap into
the air slammed down and when he did
that slam it hits with so much force
that it actually pulls those people
nearby in close to him and then he
immediately followed it up with a
whirlwind attack that allows him to
attack all around and basically just
devastate three people all at once which
is what competitive multiplayer gaming
is about absolutely that was the next
point so competitive multiplayer gaming
is we were talking about how it's all
about this idea of one understanding why
you die if you do die because that's why
would you agree is one of the most
frustrating parts absolutely so how do
you deal with that well I think
generally that you know dying is usually
the worst moment in competitive gaming
because it's losing right and we do some
things to try and take away this thing
of that one of the things is is we give
moments of anticipation where basically
you see someone up above you and they're
about to slam down and you
you recognize that you view your action
so far can't you kind of screwed up and
you have to kind of accept your fate at
that point because you're about to be
blasted into smithereens and so we found
that people on top of the violence of it
which gas adds in some humor so
basically people have something to laugh
at even when they die it's also a game
where you know this is a beautiful
serene and at first calm looking world
where you're looking at these beautiful
desert sands and these polished palaces
of marble now all of a sudden everything
is going to be covered in blood and guts
and it's sort of an art style that we've
been able to build using Unreal Engine 4
which you know as a small team we're
like 23 guys and we're able to make a
big you know a game that feels big yeah
Unreal Engine 4 definitely a major
enabler in creating triple-a looking
titles so wrapping up here with
housekeeping stuff what's the is there a
target tentative release date price
anything like that right now yeah we've
got so basically first of all the game
is a more traditional style it's thirty
dollars and you're done that's that's
the way it works and we just announced a
week or two ago but we're on a very
condensed schedule so the game is going
to launch later this year there's a beta
in the summer and then if you're at PAX
East we're going to be there playing the
game with people hands-on for the first
time so there's a lot going on for us
yeah it's going to be really exciting
year ahead of us can't wait for pax east
can't wait for beta in the summer as
well for all our fans to get a hint
their hands on it and just see what they
can destroy in this world absolutely so
we will be at PAX East and will
definitely continue coverage at that
point if you're interested in learning
more about Mirage hit links in the

article coverage and thank you for
watching we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
