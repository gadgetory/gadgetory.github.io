AMD how's it going Raja it's going good
it's good to have you here yeah thank
you for hosting us we are in the am the
offices in Sunnyvale and the last time
we spoke was at the Macao event for
Polaris right so since then a couple
major things have happened in game
technology the main one I guess to call
attention to it would be doom with
Vulcan being kind of like a seminal
example mmm-hmm a Vulcan working so a
major topic I wanted to ask you about
was this idea of shader intrinsic
function so we talked about this briefly
in our 480 review since then it's become
a lot more relevant can you give folks a
top-level overview of shader intrinsic
functions then we'll drill down into it
yeah absolutely so kind of you know
before we go specific on children 26
right you know the thing about first
wall command dx12 is the reason we are
very much excited about and you know we
start with the whole mantle initiative
for low-level API is it was around
reducing the overhead of the API so that
you don't need as many CPU cycles to you
know push a frame to the GPU right and
and also take advantage of all the
courses that are available in the system
and all the resources available in the
system and that was the intent of those
aps and and there was a basis for that
that game consoles we're all based
around kind of a very lower head low
level APRs and if you look at a game
console and compare it to a PC right if
you just kind of as a game outright if I
put myself as a gamer right you look at
like can you pay $2.99 or $399 you get
the whole box and you get the game and
if you compare to the experience for the
hour of game console to the experience
for dollar of a PC game console is so
far ahead you know that you get so much
more I'm not saying that PC games don't
look good right but they cost all right
yeah no one's saying consoles or
whatever's better than the other is just
nuts per dollar it's just if you see
experience but I call it
so much better right and when you look
at it and you know that bothered us all
the time that you know it's the same
hardware you have actually more hardware
sitting on a PC and why is it that we
can't give you know better experience
per dollar can see right and when you
kind of analyze it from a technical
standpoint right all this kind of you
know software infrastructure issues come
about right one is the you know the API
itself is I overhead you know the
developer has more control of all the
you know CPU cores and GPU on the
console and not on the PC so the first
step to that was hey can we do a lower
head API on the PC which was kind of in
a check with the x12 and welcome okay
the next step so the API is one thing
the next step is they are a whole bunch
of hardware features right and
instructions and all that are not
exactly exposed through standard API so
right like the experiment welcome okay
so we had and we see that these features
are leveraged by the developer on the
console to get you know 10% 20% 30% I'm
saying 2x performance and when they
poured their game over to the PC they
say ah I was doing this on the console
and I know it's the same GCN
architecture but I can't get access to
this stuff right and so shader in turn
six were one of those things that the
you know the folks at Bethesda were
using on they were doing some
interesting things on the console and we
said hey how do we give you access to
the same thing on a PC so that's how you
know that's kind of the motivation for
the shade of intrinsic functions that we
added to welcome where they could map
their algorithms that they were doing on
the console onto the PC I guess at a top
level to it if I understand it right
shader intrinsic functions sort of
remove some abstraction layers to the
hardware yes right so that is it going
straight to machine code or when your
motor dies I mean the compiler still has
to kinda you know make sure that you
know that everything is a you know
legal proper program right that that's
effective the hardware so compiler helps
but yeah it's it's almost like inline
assembly you know if you're an assembly
program or you know you can inject in
some versions of C compilers you can
have inline assembly right say hey this
this instruction just pass it on right
you know don't do anything so it's kind
of like that where you can insert these
instructions right so so they can get as
far at least as far as shader programs
go near equivalent to whatever they can
do on a on a game console right and and
and it's cool that you know we we love
welcome that allows us to extend the API
to add these kind of features within our
own schedule within our own control we
don't have to go ask permission for
everybody and you know other than you
know getting the game developers to
adopt it so that's so you're excited and
what you will see us doing Steve from a
game developer perspective is you'll see
us kind of opening up a min the whole
GPU open initiative and you know we can
go more into that but was the idea was
to make all the tools available on the
PC right so if something is available in
the hardware the developer needs to find
a way to get to it so that was our goal
right so it's not always easy to provide
the console level access but we are
trying you know you're opening up every
every door we can right so I think you
know if you drive the experience per
dollar for the PC to be I it doesn't
need to match console but it you know I
think right now it's probably a factor
of two or three easily factor of three
off right sure so if it kind of gets
closer
you know PC gaming will try Vivaan more
right I mean you know it's like it's a
rich rich ecosystem and also things like
we are happening and other stuff it just
takes it to the next level right so I
guess to take a step back and remind
folks
it's important to have this more direct
access to the hardware we can look at I
guess the the most probably cited aspect
would be with direct x12 revoked in
where you can move these draw calls
directly to the GPU mm-hmm and eliminate
that overhead on the cpu so speaking to
that when looking at shader intrinsic
functions with doom as an example what
is sort of the immediate performance
benefit that people should be looking
for with Shaden so Sheldon yeah it's a
really interesting question it could you
know the lower head API is the benefit
comes in application scenarios where
your CPU bomb right right with children
26 it's actually a GPU feature it is
like it helps in a GPU bound scenario
right so my game is GPU bound you know
whatever rendering I'm doing whatever
drawing or anything then I need to find
a better way to do the drawing right so
I still want to accomplish drawing the
same picture but can I do it in less
number of cycles right you know less
less number of instructions and that's
where you know hey what is the hardware
capable of you know can I do like you
know combine these four operations
together into kind of an interesting
instruction that the hardware may have
but I don't have control of that because
I'm writing code at a high level and
passing it through a compiler right so
that's where shader intrinsics kick in
is when I'm GPU bound which is a very
common scenario especially if you do
anything 1080p are about you know yeah
your GPU Bond right so your CPU burned
at lower resolutions but you know at
1080p and above you tend to become more
GPU bound right where the shader
intersects kick in and help you write
which is part of the the immediate
benefit there too is I feel like this
generation of hardware more than ever
we're seeing like there are X 480 as an
example is a 200 250 dollar card but
you're able to play pretty easily 1440p
yes I write you know higher definition
graphics yeah which is you know what's
long time coming to town
you know $200 level but yet it's an
exciting place for a PC game all right
that is it for part one of our interview
with Raja Kaduri check back on Saturday
the 22nd for part 2 where we talk about
GPU open what it is how it compares to
CUDA and we also talked about how
software is more than 50% of the formula
when talking about software and hardware
and what they output for gaming BR and
otherwise so check back for that on
Saturday otherwise patreon links the
post roll video as always subscribe for
more and I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
