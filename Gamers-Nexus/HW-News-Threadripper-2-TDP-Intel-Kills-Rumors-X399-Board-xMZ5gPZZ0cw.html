hardware news recap we have one bit of
software news this week which is notepad
part of Windows is getting the first
update it's gotten in a very long time
so notepads get an update Intel also
debunked rumors regarding the death of
its Extreme Edition branding I guess the
rumors of its demise were greatly
exaggerated a German Court forbids the
soon marketing surrounding pre-orders
and things like that especially
affecting Kickstarter IndieGoGo
campaigns that'll be interesting
threaded for TDP more or less confirmed
at this point and some follow-up news on
things we spoke about in the last two
Hardware news episodes before that this
video is brought to you by NZXT is new h
500 case which we recently found to have
an impressively effective cooling setup
that is entirely negative pressure when
stock the H 500 is the successor of the
s 340 and s 340 a lead offering high
build quality that's all steel and glass
and kael management features that are
also a top class for the $70 compact mid
tower case age 500 is a part of NZXT
Zanu H Series lineup which also features
options from Mini ITX micro ATX and full
ATX builds learn more at the link of the
description below just quickly as noted
in some of the other videos we just
restock these by the way the teal
version of our teardown sure it's been
very popular
if you've wanted it it's back in stock
in a lot of sizes you can go to store
document access dotnet to pick up one of
these shirts that I'm wearing today if
you like it
so first main news item Intel debunking
rumors regarding the extreme edition
branding demise this comes after a
former Intel employee Francois Piatt
null excuse my pronunciation casually I
suppose you could say excuse my french
casually tweeted a quote the hashtag
extreme edition brand is about to get
killed what a big mistake
it's very melodramatic so that was a few
days ago there's no further information
on at all there's no explanation and it
got posted on a couple of websites
online PC gamer reached out to Intel and
Intel responded that quote there is no
change to the branding of the Intel Core
Extreme Edition processor and Intel Core
x-series processor family so that's
more or less the entirety of that news
item extreme edition apparently isn't
going anywhere we'll see if that remains
true though a German Court this is the
next one so a German Court forbids the
soon TM marketing that we've seen all
over the place this court ruled that it
is illegal to sell pre-orders without
specifying certain parameters like
delivery dates the case originates from
an advertisement soliciting pre-orders
for the Samsung Galaxy s6 back in August
of 2016 and this used the phrase vault
fair fook bar which is coming soon this
applies to both physical goods and
software licenses like video games
that's where it gets interesting for
this one so if valve ever mentions
half-life 3 again they'll be in big
trouble
the ruling up holds an earlier judgement
and will become final after the appeals
period expires so going forward this is
not just a ban on pre-orders or anything
like that this is specifically talking
about instances like that of the samsung
galaxy s6
where you could buy into the phone and
then who knows when it'll show up so
it's not just announcing the
availability of the product with the
pre-order and giving a launch date it's
also when are you going to get it
because as we all know you can order it
early if it's something like a phone
there's still no guarantee that you
actually get one when it comes out
because there might be a big wait list
so you could be waiting a long time so
this should more or less shut that down
good for the consumer overall not great
for companies but the consumer is the
one that needs the protection here so
interesting ruling from Germany we'll
see how it goes and how it plays out in
the appeals period thread report EDP
more or less confirmed at this point
this has been confirmed a few times now
but just to go over it one more time and
these thread Ripper to line up is due
out in August probably the second or
third week of August from everything
we've seen and this is officially stated
by Andy it's known to be August not a
rumor so there's a again likely launch
window around the 13th from rumors are
saying that's not official and we
already had official information
bouncing back and forth that suggested a
250 watt TDP for the upcoming thread
over to processors this is a pretty
significant uplift and means that with
overclocking specifically there could be
concerns for existing x3 99 motherboards
with the vrm and vrm cooling solutions
that are in place today - 250 watt TDP
for some of the upcoming throw 2 for 2
CPUs and including a 24 core and a 32
core with the higher TD be assigned
obviously to the 32 core there's a new
gigabyte x3 9 extreme motherboard
listing as well that supports this claim
of the TDP and this further supports
build Zoids previous concerns in one of
his videos about existing x3 99 of
motherboard vrm support of threader / to
power requirements and - which by the
way am the underscore James on reddit
replied saying quote maybe you should
wait till you get your hands on the
product before spending time drawing
conclusions but salty there but turns
out build Zoid was right so if you're
planning on overclocking thread ripper
despite the unnecessarily snarky
response from AMD it appears that there
is cause for consideration here on
existing x3 99 boards that's why new
ones are coming out like the MSI x2 9 &amp;amp;
9 creation that we saw at Computex which
we should have footage of in a video on
the channel if you're interested in it
which by the way that's one of the most
beefed out boards we've seen for this
platform so far actually it's the most
that we've seen for the platform so far
so for overclocking purposes you're
gonna want to look into new x2 nandana
399 boards that's getting really old
today with stronger v arms for big
overclocks stock is a different story
naturally you don't need as much for
stock but that's the nature of running
something stock speaking of the ex 399
extreme board viewers of our content
will be happy to hear that gigabyte has
specifically marked the heatsink as
having fins as an on the slide that was
leaked there's an arrow pointed to it
that's a fins so this is something
manufacturers have been rediscovering
lately gigabyte will give them credit
was one of the first to really put a
proper heatsink on an X 470 I am for
motherboard it looks like they're trying
to carry that over to X 399 and is also
something that we showed at Computex if
you want to see their ex 399 board we
did have a preview there for you so
looking to use a 10 + 3 B RM we're not
sure on what power stages are actually
used so I know there's some discussion
online but
we're gonna wait and get some final
official information on that before we
go further with it next at news item SK
Hynix and Samsung apparently have
suspicions that some of their
intellectual property and patents are
being stolen by China based DRAM
companies following up on two stories we
had in the last couple of weeks The
Korea Times reports that Chinese memory
chip manufacturers are quote attempting
to infringe on samsung and SK patents
according to an official who remained
unnamed for the article no specific
company is accused and Samsung and SK
have both declined to the Korea Times
request for comment so we've got a limit
to what we can really talk about here
this still adds to the pile of patent
infringement drama that we've been
reporting on the last couple of weeks
which recently resulted in the temporary
bans of a few micron products in China
Chinese companies are trying hard to
break into the semiconductor market but
it's hard to feel sorry for the massive
corporations when they're a constantly
under investigation for price-fixing at
the same time so if that's still going
on for hynek's Samsung and micron while
there are these patent and IP thefts
concerns as well and if you don't know
China as in the government of China is
actively looking into creating its own
state-owned memory manufacturers as well
which would introduce competition to the
market for the only three memory
manufacturers that exists currently but
it would be different in that it would
be state-owned or at least partially
state-owned from from what the reports
online have indicated anyway so
interesting story to follow we don't
have a lot more than that right now next
one this is something that we saw
published on on Tom's Hardware so credit
to them for this story but Tom's is
getting brave and venturing into things
that are just kind of loosely related to
both politics and hardware we try to
stay out of politics and we do
successfully but when it impacts the
space that's when we'll talk about
whatever is going on I'm going to
present this neutrally and just talk
about what I read on the top story so
bear with me here so this is the
regarding the so-called trade war that's
been discussed
lately and tom says that the tariffs
imposed on Chinese goods about a week
ago or so could potentially impact the
price of PC components and pre-built
systems
this impact may not be direct but there
are concerns about supply chain
disruptions to products that use Chinese
parts it's unlikely that retailers will
swallow the higher costs but will likely
pass them on to consumers instead the
trade war goes both ways here so this is
bad news for both American companies
importing from China and Chinese
companies trying to expand in the u.s.
like Alibaba who are actually facing
issues now with investment and growth in
u.s. for Alibaba and Aliexpress so
that's all we're gonna say on that one
but so I'm going to pay attention to you
because it does exit like direct
hardware news but it's very related to
the industry we've talked about price a
lot lately regarding things like price
fixing and this is potentially impacting
prices as well so we'll keep an eye on
it for you next one up this is this is a
fun news item if you are like many of us
in the enthusiast space notepad is
something of a sacred program it's meant
to be as untouched and unfilled with
bloat as possible you just use it to
copy and paste things in the strip
formatting for example or take easy
notes or do some simple Python scripting
something like that so Microsoft the
creators of the smash hit paint 3d which
we can show you some footage of if you
haven't seen it are now updating notepad
for the first time in many many years
and this concerned us when we first saw
the headlines because I was worried
about notepad 3d a be in the next thing
so it sounds like they deserve some
cautious optimism this time this time
Microsoft is updating notepad and notes
that the improvements that will be
rolled into the Windows 10 red stone 5
update include quote support for UNIX
and Macintosh line endings wraparound
Finder plays toggling so ctrl-f can
search the whole document rather than
just above or below the cursor text
zooming ability to see the real line and
column numbers even when word wrap is
enabled and improved performance when
opening large file plus some other minor
features and bug
so all these features make notepad
better at doing things that people
actually want to use notepad for rather
than cluttering the UI with junk and
unnecessary features which is a good and
rare kind of update these days next up
Samsung's fifth-generation v-nand has
entered mass production starting with
the 256 gigabyte TLC die the new chips
are 96 layers up from 64 and the height
of each layer has been reduced to 20%
they're making use of the toggle ddr4
2.0 interface to reach data transfer
speeds of 1.4 gigabits per second a 40%
increase over the 64 layer of ena and a
speed of 800 megabits per second
operating voltage has been lowered to
1.2 volts from 1.8 and samsung claims of
course that energy consumption is
therefore comparable to that of a 64
layer chip right latency is down to 500
microseconds and read latency is down to
50 expect to see the 256 gigabit die and
mobile devices and SSDs soon TM but
don't tell anyone in Germany about that
because it's not allowed any more
hardware sales would last in here
as rock and their phantom gaming rx 580
will be shipping with free be 350
motherboards so as Rock new to the GPU
market if you're not aware and their
phantom gaming series is a month is
actually their first steps to try and
make an AI B version of a card and they
are shipping it with a freebie 350 board
also by agile rock for a $300 total
there's actually not a bad deal now
whether or not the board is any good
kind of depends because they keep
changing the steel so it might be
different by the time this video is live
but they're changing everyday 300 bucks
is it's really not too bad considering a
5 80s tough to get for MSRP anyway and
then also GT x 1080 founder's editions
and 1080 TI fe as have been cheaper
lately EVGA SB stock site has had a few
listed though it is be stock so it's
probably refurbished but they've been
400 to 600 bucks which we haven't seen
in a very long time so that's good
hopefully it keeps going that way
of course there are rumors of new GPUs
we don't know when they are going to be
or what specifically is launching at
this time so if you're buying it's
basically a matter
you need something anyway and you can't
wait which is fine because we don't know
exactly what's coming out or if it'll
even be available at launch stock has
always been questionable over the past
year and a half now so we'll see we'll
see how that goes
that's it for this news roundup I am
going to be in Canada for Linus's LTX
his Expo should be a lot of fun by the
time this video goes up it might be
happening already it's on Saturday July
14th I think so we've got a bunch of ask
jams we film to film to 8086 K videos
filmed there's six videos in one day we
just did and we'll be back to in the lab
testing shortly I'll probably film
something with J or Linus or Luke while
I'm out there and make sure you
subscribe to catch those videos if any
of those names are appealing to you
