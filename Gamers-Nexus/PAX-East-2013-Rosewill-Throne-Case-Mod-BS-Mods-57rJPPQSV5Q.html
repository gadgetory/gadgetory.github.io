pax east 2013 this is here is that
Roosevelt booth my name is boo and I
want to give you a quick overview of our
showcase here we have at our booth this
is made with our roseville throne I will
be introducing later this year this is
modified done by BS mods and this is
called the throne industrial this is
more for industrial steel look so what
they've done is they removed top panel
fins they've installed a custom made
steel meshing at the top and they remove
the stock fans and they've installed
industrial server keep fans in there
that are spinning at eleven to twelve
thousand rpm they've also removed the
guards that will definitely cook give a
good cut to your finger if you dare to
poke your finger in there I don't
recommend that here we have the custom
painted throne industrial to show off
our panel we have the custom look for
the welding and being to give you that
put together look and here on the front
side we have the analog 12 volt readout
little knob here if you pull it it will
turn on the strobe light inside the
system to give you that little flashing
clip here on the front you can see the
same design the front mesh as you do on
the top panel the LED lighting here can
be controlled via infrared remote and I
can't change between red green blue or
this assortment of rainbow colors here
at the very top you do have an hour
readout this will let you know how many
hours this system has been turned on and
here you see a key which is specialist
especially designed for us to insert the
key and twist to turn on the system very
cool you can come over on this side here
we want to show you that custom made
side panel this is made with real safety
glass and this will definitely keep your
computer save it will not be damaged
inside is being powered by our hercules
1600 watt and it's been custom-made they
removed the outer exterior and they gave
it a new exterior to match the rest of
the team with the system the steel mesh
look as a custom wiring system which
routes all the cables to keep it nice
and neat and hidden and it's cooled by
swiftech water cooling to an only radio
radiator and they have installed a
custom canister to hold the coolant to
keep the system nice and cool and it's
all being ran with
intel i7 processor with three gtx 680
video cards with the Kingston's solid
state 1 and 20 gigabytes solid state
drive so definitely a very custom look a
very good aggressive looking case and we
definitely recommend you to come by and
take a look for yourself it will amaze
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
