we're gonna be taking a look at a more
affordable X 570 motherboard from
gigabyte this is the x5 70 horas elite
which is pretty much pretty pretty close
to like the lot while it's the third
from the bottom of their motherboard
lineup which I think they only have like
six or seven motherboards in total so
that doesn't really make much of a
difference but uh anyway yeah so we are
taking a look at this this is one of the
cheaper x5 70 motherboards I am Not sure
like I don't know that I can reveal
prices yet so yeah but it this this is
probably like this board is not aimed
well it'll run the 16 core just fine
it's just not necessarily aimed at
people considering a seven hundred and
fifty dollar CPU before that this video

anyway things worth noting this socketed
BIOS chip is just a part of this being
an es motherboard so this is an
engineering sample which is also like
why this is missing right here so on the
retail board you will not have a
socketed BIOS chip so you'll have just a
single BIOS or right there and yes this
is a gigabyte board with single BIOS
instead of dual BIOS I am not sure if
that's most if that's a cost saving
thing or if that's just because I've
complained to them on multiple occasions
about how stupid their dual BIOS system
is when you know it will randomly help
from one BIOS chip to the other so yeah
like that gets really annoying if you're
overclocking and people who use gigabyte
motherboards know exactly what I'm
talking about or have have experienced
it and don't even know what's causing it
and so yeah but it's super annoying
basically you lose all of your settings
at random
it's it's really not fun so that might
be part of why this board like on their
higher end boards they still have dual
BIOS but they also give you like vial
switches on their lower end boards I
guess they just kind of decided instead
of putting a while switches we'll just
throw the BIOS chip out of the extra
BIOS chip out completely
anyway the board does have a q-flash
functionality so you can update the bios
of the motherboard without even having a
cpu installed which is really useful if
you had like it's you know a new if
you're buying the board and there's a
new cpu out that it doesn't support yet
but x5 70 is launching along with the
rise in 3000 series lineup so that
feature will only really be useful like
next year if we see another generation
of CPU like another wave of CPUs for the
AF for the x5 70 chipset there's no no
debug features of any kind anywhere on
this motherboard there's no debug LEDs
there's no D there's no post code so I
mean I the the Speaker I think is still
present so you know if you want your
motherboard to beep at you you do still
have that option but uh you know the the
in my opinion more pleasant
troubleshooting features are not present
on this board because it is you know
kind of at the bottom of the of the line
up from gigabyte so boards above this
actually do do include troubleshooting
LEDs this this one doesn't anyway so
with that out of the way let's get into
the vrm because that is something where
I don't really have any complaints
because gigabyte has like the the funny
thing is if you have like gigabytes am
for lineup for say X 470 and B 450 is
you have the X you have the X 470 gaming
seven which is a really good motherboard
and then you have everything under it
and that's bad like and I'm not joking
about that like they've got the gaming
seven and then everything under it is
bad in my opinion you should not
consider those motherboards but since
then gigabyte has done a complete 180
and so even something like the x5 70 a
leak right here the Auris elite right
here
actually has a really solid vrm so
you've got a 12 phase V core because
like so right off the bat this vrm is
more powerful than the v RM you get on
the gaming seven the x4
70 gaming 7 so 12 phase V core and a + 2
phase SOC so pretty standard on the SOC
VR I'm right here because obviously like
this wouldn't necessarily be ideal for
like powering an APU
if you're into like heavy APU
overclocking which I'm a huge fan of
it's super fun if you're into
overclocking things for the sake of
overclocking things bla maxing out ap
use is really really fun they scale
great but this board is obviously not
meant for MATLAB this is meant for more
like a 3900 x 39 50 X 3800 X 3700 X
right really some of the higher-end
Rison third gen CPUs and so it just goes
with a two-phase SOC vrm because you
don't really need anything more than
that for for powering the SOC the
voltage controller used is an is l69 one
three eight six nine one three eight
which is a seven phase voltage
controller and a gigabyte is running it
in a six plus one phase configuration
now this is like the highest end voltage
controller that inter-cell makes so it's
really really good like like this is the
same voltage controller you can see on
something like the X 299 OC formula from
asrock the X 299 dark from EVGA the X
299 trying to remember it no X 299
there's a bunch of X 2 other X 299
boards that use it I think even from
gigabyte it's just that I've not really
been paying attention to that sign of
their motherboard lineup and then
there's the Z 390 dark also uses the ISL
69 1 3 8 so this is a very popular chip
for for high-end motherboards because
it's it's basically the latest and
greatest you can get from inter-cell
anyway it's running as a six plus one
phase and to achieve the twelve phase
configuration for V Corps here gigabyte
is of course using a bunch of doublers
so you have double are one two three
four five and six so these are all
Intersil and GIMP is freaking out for
like it's been doing this today I don't
know why I don't really care so yeah
these are all is l66 one sevens and
what's special about the is l6 six one
seven as a doubler is that it can
actually current balance
which is not something you get on all
doublers so basically what this means is
the is l66 1:7 monitors the current
going through each of the phases that
it's connected to and it will protect
like do PWM pulse extensions for
whichever phase is handling less current
in order to get the current balance more
optimal between the two phases the
reason why you want this is it will give
you slightly better efficiency than if
you have a dumb doubler that doesn't do
that at all because ideally you want the
current spread evenly across all of your
phases as well or as evenly as possible
so yeah these these actually do that on
their own the one downside to running
doublers is that you do have slightly
well you basically get a bit of delay on
your pwm signal which leads to slightly
worse transient response though it also
depends on how the rest of your vrm is
designed is there's other things you can
do to try improve the transient response
to negate the like the the side effects
of running doublers and also depending
on how much impact the doublers actually
have on your transient response it might
not even matter in the grand scheme of
things right that that's that's another
thing is if you have only a couple
millivolts difference between a doubled
scheme and a not doubled scheme well
you're not gonna notice that because
it's 10 millivolts on a transient like
that's not something that is CPU really
sees on the regular so yeah I'm like I'm
a fan of the control scheme like
gigabytes going for here it's really
like you're not gonna get 12 phases on a
motherboard at this price point any
other way like the the high phase count
voltage controllers from like Infineon
the X DP 1 3 to g5 see it's just too
damn expensive if you're not gonna use
it
yeah like even factoring the cost of all
the doublers into the cost with along
with the cost of the 16913 8 like the
new 16 phase controllers from ana neon
just cost more than that so yeah that's
what's going on with the control scheme
for the actual power stages we're
looking at si si
six three fours from Intersil and these
are 50 amp dr moss components so we're
go up there because that's all red dr
moss this is actually the same power
state like so fun fact this is actually
basically the exact same vrm that you
would get on a as rock x5 70 Tai Chi
motherboard except that this uses the
ISL 69 1 3 8 whereas asrock is using the
ISL 69 1 4 7 there's not really much of
a difference between the two the 69 1 4
7 I think is just a little bit cheaper
because it's an AMD specific chip though
I've not checked that or it might have
some new AMD features on it because like
this is a chip that's been around for a
while and it does evidently support
AMD's voltage regulator standard because
gigabyte is using it on an AMD
motherboard it's just that yeah as rock
is using a like variant like a very
similar chip to this that doesn't work
on Intel like that's the biggest
difference with the six nine one four
seven is six nine yeah one four seven is
that yeah that one doesn't work on Intel
this one works on both Intel and AMD not
really a huge difference but on the
Taichi you get those in power stages you
get the same phase count you get the
same doublers so except I'm not sure
what the Taichi costs compared to this
board so that's kind of yeah so like
that this could potentially be like VR
my is this is potentially really good
good value for life good really good
performance for the for the cost of the
board so anyway let's take a look at the
VR I'm efficiency here since oh and I
forgot to mention so dr moss stands for
driver MOSFET these are dumb so there
are a type of power stage they're like
the dumbest type of power stage you can
have the oldest power stage standard if
I'm not mistaken because they're
literally just a driver I see along with
a two sets two MOSFETs which is like the
bare minimum you need to build a power
stage and I call them dumb because if
you look at a lot of other power stages
they'll include things like current
monitoring or temperature monitoring and
then if you've got the really smart
power stages they'll not only monitor
the current they'll also shut down when
the current gets too high for Satan's a
safe long-term operation and that kind
of so you'll have like over current
protection and protected like other
protections built into the actual power
stages themselves directly whereas with
these I mean like you have to implement
your current monitoring as an extra
circuit you need to implement your
temperature monitoring as another
external just component somewhere right
so yeah that's that's the difference
between dr moss and something like a pow
ir stage from international rectifier or
a smart power stage which is the new
Intel voltage regulator standard which
includes a whole bunch of like extra
monitoring requirements which dr moss is
also an intel voltage regulator standard
if I'm not mistaken like from like 2004
or something so it is really old anyway
so for operating parameters of 1.2 volts
out and 300 kilohertz switching
frequency along with 5 volts drive
because that is what these power stages
run on we're gonna be looking at the
following kind of heat output from the
vrm for the current outputs so at a
hundred amps current output this vrm
will produce about 10 watts of heat
which the quite frankly you shouldn't
even need a heatsink for that then for a
hundred 50 amps output it'll produce
about 16 watts of heat which at this
point i heatsink is necessary is
probably we're probably a good idea but
you don't need like air flow or anything
this is a roughly around the current
draw that you would expect from a maxed
out 12 Corizon running like prime95 so
p95 then going up to 200 amps which is
well at 200 amps this V r1 will produce
about 24 watts of heat at and this is
the current draw that like the 16 core
completely maxed out would pull in
prime95 so that's max down as an
overclock to not as in stock settings
running prime95 because if you're
running stock settings if you're running
prime95 on stock settings and it'll
throttle down to somewhere around 100
amp the year maybe maybe below that
maybe slightly above that but it won't
be anywhere near 200 amps so yeah at
stock you probably wouldn't need a vrm
heatsink whatsoever at you know heavy
overclocks on the 12 core 16 core this
vrm will handle that just fine with the
heatsink that it comes with even though
they do have this lovely air flow
restrictor right right next to the next
to the VR I mean sink like it does
well if you look up photos of the
motherboard then the heatsink look
something like that and it's it's it's
substantial it's not the highest surface
area heatsink I've ever seen but at the
same time this is also quite the like
this is a pretty efficient vrm and it's
not like you have all 12 phases dumping
all of their heat into the heatsink
right here you have three phases up here
that also put heat into the heatsink on
the top edge of the motherboard and that
just reduces the amount of work that
this heatsink has to do in terms of
cooling so yeah I don't like this
honestly like if like this VR room is
great honestly it's you don't need
anything more powerful than this if
you'd ask me you know the board even has
the single eye pin like the only thing I
would really complain about on this
motherboard is that yeah it's single
BIOS there's no postcode there's no
troubleshooting at it ladies those are
like my main complaints for this
motherboard the vrm right here like as I
said gigabyte did a 180 it's just like
it used to be that they had some of the
very worst designs and now it's like
well this this right here you've got a
you know like again well I can't I'm not
sure I can share the price point but uh
like that for the price out of the
boards that I've seen this looks really
good so yeah like as far as I'm
concerned that this is great anyway
going up into unreasonable current draw
levels like 300 amps which would be like
saying liquid nitrogen overclocking on
the 16 core or something which I
wouldn't recommend this motherboard for
because like the the big thing is when
we are like the no postcode no no debug
LEDs but there's also going to be things
missing that are actually important for
extreme overclocking like some of the
minor voltage rails that you have to
tune for cold boot bugs and cold bugs
and better overclocking on liquid
nitrogen there's like a whole bunch of
weird stuff that happens when you take
silicon really cold that you need to
compensate for with extra voltage and
voltage in areas of the CPU that
normally don't scale with voltage at all
like this board is not going to have
those so you know this is purely a
theoretical thing but just to give you
an idea of how good the RM is so 300
amps output this vrm would produce about
44 watts of heat which that is actually
a lot of heat and you do like this
depends on how good your heating
system is and also how much airflow it's
getting so yeah the board's obviously
not designed for this if you look at
what what it's the the actual heat sink
side it comes with like you'd need to
get a pretty high rpm fan sitting over
the vrm for this to be viable for long
term loads but at the same time as I
just said like the 16 core is gonna max
out at around 200 amps so that's not
really something you need to worry about
and then going up to 400 amps it's just
I'm comparing like the thing is for a
lot of the other more ridiculous x5 70
motherboards this is actually a totally
doable current output like no problem
so going up to 400 amps that's where I
think this motherboard just yeah like
that's not like at this point you're
talking like custom water cooling for
the vrm to keep it at acceptable
temperatures and going all the way up to
500 amps eighty-six watts of heat better
water cool actually water cooling is so
ridiculously overpowered that it like it
would probably take care of these two
the same about equally well like you
wouldn't really know it's as much of a
temperature difference between 71 watts
and 86 watts depending on how much
surface area you're vrm water block has
but yeah it's like this is obviously not
what the board is designed for so for
current and draws we're risin would
actually run this vrm is absolutely
great like you can't it's free you get a
12 phase you got your 50 MDR Maus like
what more could you really want well
what more could you really need I mean
you could get international rectifier
which might have some well Intersil
technically supports everything IR
supports it's just like I don't know how
well it's implemented by the board
vendors so I'd be very surprised if you
notice two major difference between
overclocking between this board and some
of the higher end boards just from the
vrm standpoint what you would notice is
like oh the other boards have a postcode
which if you're doing memory
overclocking is super nice to have
because it helps you troubleshoot a lot
of boot up errors whereas this doesn't
really have anything but yeah like vrm
wise I mean you know if gigabyte took
this vrm and stuck with it all the way
through their entire lineup I still
wouldn't really complain about it it's
just that they decided for the
higher-end boards they're the
they're gonna go with even slightly
better designs now then for the
capacitors gigabyte is using a bunch of
a pack capacitors which are really
popular with both gigabyte and asus for
their lower end boards this is a
Taiwanese capacitor manufacturer and
these are all aluminum polymers so these
inherently just last for kind of forever
they don't like unlike say liquid
electrolyte aluminum capacitors these
don't blow up because there's no liquid
in them to like expand so you know these
last for ages the main main thing with
them is that over time as they degrade
they basically fail open so it acts like
there's no capacitors but that takes
many many years and these are still
rated for 5000 hours at a hundred five
degrees Celsius so you know I wouldn't
like it's not Japanese capacitors but I
wouldn't stress out about this because
like these are fine
also this vrm won't run hot enough that
the temperature rating of the capacitor
should really be much of a concern
anyway especially if you're not if
you're not on like a 12 core something
this v arm is gonna be running ice-cold
so yeah it's like at that point you know
the capacitors really will last way way
longer because they're gonna be just
running so much cooler and we have the
same on the back here we do have only a
single light pin which is fine because a
single eight pin can handle 384 waltz
motherboards with more than like there's
a bunch of low end motherboards with
like an 8 pin and a 4 pin that does not
make them better because a single 8 pin
can already completely well you know one
point well okay it's not gonna be one
point two volts for that 200 amp figure
but you're not hitting 384 watts on a
Rison 16 core on prime not even on
prime95 with like water cooling okay
maybe own liquid nitrogen this might be
a problem but for day-to-day
overclocking this is this is perfectly
fine I have no complaints there and then
the SOC vrm we're looking at at a so
this is the only place where I really
would complain about the vrm but the
thing is this does only like if you're
running or the seat like this is real
this boards meant for CPUs not ap use
right like why would you pair a mother
an x5 70 board which is rather expensive
with an ape
you so yeah this is like the only place
where I could say like yeah gigabytes
not going with top-of-the-line of erm
components because they're just going
with the usual so they have a high side
MOSFET just discrete MOSFETs and these
are gigabytes favourite and these are
MOSFETs that I rip on a lot in some of
my videos because they are they're not
great the thing is is like you don't
need a great MOSFET if you don't have to
handle any power right like you need to
you need to choose your components to
fit the job not like you're not gonna
use a 70 M freaking power stage for
memory power because that's a waste of
70 M power stages ddr4 doesn't mean that
much current capability anyway so you
have a four-seat n n from on
semiconductor for the high side and a 4c
0 6 and for the low side there's another
highside and low-side MOSFET on the back
of the board which is done for just
basically better current handling
because yeah so you have a high side
here and another high side there in
another low side there and another low
side there so this does actually
increase the current capability of each
of the phases and this is perfectly fine
for just powering the CPUs which is what
this board is going to be doing with
this SOC VR well for powering the SOC of
the various CPUs so yeah that's what's
going on with that the memory topology
is a daisy-chain so gigabyte is going
with daisy chain for their entire x 517
motherboard lineup i am not sure how it
will support so daisy chain biases
towards two times eight configurations
so this will generally give you and like
the thing is two times eight is
generally the most overclockable
configuration regardless of like well no
t topology will often run better on four
by eight depending on how good the
memory controller of the cpu is as well
but uh 2 by 8 is what's optimal for this
mother like definitely where you're
gonna hit the highest speeds with this
motherboard and that would be on this
dim slaw and that dim slop because of
the way daisy chain works because it
basically hits one slaw and then the
next you can actually see that on the
back of the board but i've shown that in
other videos so you know I'm not gonna
go go over that for higher density
capacities a 2 by 16 single rank my
actual should also well
higher capacities are a big no idea for
me because I know for a fact that
already on X 470 daisy-chain boards can
do thirty two hundred megahertz on a
four by eight just fine they can also do
thirty two hundred on two by 16 so the
with with risin three thousand I don't
know how the memory controller is
improved I don't know how the biases of
the motherboards have improved so
there's a good chance that you know two
by sixteen and a four by eight might
have very little difference between them
or two by 16 is just vastly superior or
two by sixteen is terrible because the
dims are all like the two by sixteen
dual rank could be terrible while 2 by
16 single rank could be amazing really
depends on too many factors to really
make a judgement for higher capacities I
would say you'd have to wait for like
motherboard QV owls to basically come
out because the board vendors they do do
do do a lot of memory testing and so I
would just check the QV L's for what
kind of memory configurations they've
tested and if you see and then sort of
try pick and choose a memory kit based
on that you don't need to choose an
exact qvl memory kit most of the time
you just need to pick something that's
similar to what they've already tested
and validated as working so yeah 2 by 16
I'd like I'm not sure if it's gonna be
better than 2 4 by 8 and then if you're
going up for like 64 gigs of RAM I'd say
2 by 32 is a pretty good bet to be
better than four by sixteen because four
by sixteen just well it could run into
the same issue as a two by 16 versus
four by eight depending on which memory
icees you're looking at and then 4 by 32
you can just kind of forget about memory
clock speed because that's just way too
much damn RAM memory controllers gonna
hate you for that anyway so that's kind
of the memory overclocking here the
memory vrm is just the usual gigabyte
standard RT 8 120 with a high side low
side and low side MOSFET so this is a
single-phase memory of erm right here
this works fine they use the same vrm
all the way up to the x5 70 extreme
because ddr4 doesn't really pull enough
power and it really is much more about
what you do with your memory trace
layout than it is about what you do with
your memory VR I'm over here like a good
single phase can you know do plenty in
terms
ddr4 overclocking because ddr4 just
doesn't pull that much power on the
other hand you can have a 3-phase memory
vrm and if your trace layout is crap the
whole motherboards memory overclocking
capabilities are also going to be crap
so yeah I'm not gonna complain about
this and this is if I this is just more
for c10 and MOSFETs from on
semiconductor which again it's fine like
ddr4 doesn't pull that much power
there's definitely gonna be some
motherboards where the ddr VR ddr4 vrm
might run a little bit cooler but this
is not gonna overheat either like this
is really not an issue so yeah it's not
the most efficient it's just like it's
gonna be a couple degrees you don't need
to worry about it quite frankly I don't
know why I even cover this vrm I should
just consider it like I should just
consider it the same way I consider the
chipset vrm irrelevant it's like it
doesn't do anything for overclocking
anyway but yeah so yeah that's the
that's the x5 70 horas elite from
gigabyte you get like it's a really
barren motherboard in terms of like sort
of features right you get your hue flash
you get a single BIOS chip you don't
really get any troubleshooting features
on the board you get you know the bare
minimum of the PCIe slots that x57 to
really support so you have your one x16
right here from the cpu and then you
have your 1 X 4 from the chipset so that
goes over there this goes over there
yeah that's that's really all there is
to the board but you do get a really
solid vrm and it is you know one of the
cheaper x5 70 motherboards out there so
I was gonna be a really really solid
option especially if like the like if
you don't care about having like I
personally would find the post code
basically a deal-breaker or the lack of
any troubleshooting LEDs a deal-breaker
but uh yeah you know if you don't care
about that kind of thing this this is a
really really solid motherboard and yeah
at least in terms of like the VR I'm in
terms of features you'll have to decide
for yourself so that's it for the video
thank you for watching like share
subscribe leave any comments questions
suggestions down in the comment section
below and if you'd like to support
gamers Nexus then you can support us
direct
through patreon uh or you can buy gamers
Nexus March on store gamers Nexus dotnet
you know there's like what is their
shirts mod mats that kind of thing
yeah and that obviously helps out
immensely with the channel so yeah and
one last thing I wanted to mention is I
have a channel called actually hardcore
overclocking where I do more mother
board PCB breakdowns and other
overclocking related stuff so if you
like overclocking you could go check
that out
so yeah because I post other videos so
yeah that's it for the video thanks for
watching and good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
