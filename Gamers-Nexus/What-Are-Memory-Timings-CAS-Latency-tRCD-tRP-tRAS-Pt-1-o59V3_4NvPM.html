impossible and break down memory timings
one by one this will be over several
content pieces we're making a big
article push on this the articles will
be linked in the description below as
always but we also have a video
component here which will have some key
animations we've made for the memory
timings memory timings are incredibly
complex it's crazy how complex they get
and we spoke with several vendors before
taking on this task as Asus told us you
need to take your time with this one
pretty easy to screw things up so as a
general introduction today we're going
to over primary timings we're going to
provide some animations of how they all
work what they do rows and column access
and all that stuff also be talking about
basic formulas to calculate cycles and
things like that and what the numbers
mean for each primary timing at a later
date and another content piece we plan
to go over the secondary and the
tertiary timings and just drill down
further as we go through this content
for RAM and memory timings because they
have a huge impact on performance in
some instances and there's not a lot of
information out there that's condensed
in just one area so we're gonna go for
that
before that this video is brought to you
by Thermal Grizzlies high end thermal
paste and liquid metal Thermal Grizzlies
cryo knot is an affordable high quality
thermal compound that doesn't face some
of the aging limitations of other pastes
on the market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted test by a tube at the link
in the description below first the
basics while memory frequency is
measured in Hertz or cycles per second
the unit from memory timings is just
plain cycles to convert clock cycles to
a measurement of time requires knowing
the frequency of the memory this is
listed in megahertz or units of 1
million Hertz
3200 megahertz has a clock frequency of
3.2 billion cycles per second so the
time for a cycle to complete should be 1
over 3.2 billion seconds however modern
memory is DDR double data rate meaning
data is
transferred on the rising and falling
edge of each clock so advertised
frequencies are twice the real clock
frequency that's part of why when you
set memory to 3200 megahertz in BIOS CPU
Z will show 1600 megahertz the time is
really 1 over 3.2 billion over 2 seconds
here if our example memory has a CL
timing of 16 clock cycles this
translates to 16 times 1 over 3.2
billion over 2 seconds or point 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 seconds or 10 nanoseconds if we
make it easier the equation is 1 over
advertised frequency over 2 times timing
in cycles equals timing in seconds for a
ddr3 1600 kid a CL of 9 translates to 11
point 2 5 nanoseconds actually slower
than our previous example latencies have
gradually increased over the years with
the physical distance that signals have
to travel the speed of light is the hard
limit here but frequency has increased
as well and therefore performance has
still improved frequency is very
important but it's just one element of
performance as with CPUs there are many
different timings but they deal with a
smallest of commands overall one of them
would be when they can be issued or how
long it takes to execute how long how
many cycles pass before a response is
sent back so we have a table here of
just the ddr4 commands from Wikipedia
which will give you some basics so we
can throw that up on the screen the
important signals from the top row are
act or activate wrasse or row access
strobe casts or column access strobes
these are no longer strobes it's a side
note and w/e or write enable wrasse and
castes are often referred to simply as
column and row address because they are
no longer strobes the terminology is a
holdover these are active low signals so
they can either be high or low H or L in
this column or 1 or 0 together they form
a 4-bit code that specifies a command to
be executed the signals have changed a
bit over the years but for the most part
ddr4 has the same list of commands that
SDRAM has always had and therefore many
of the same timings for some background
information on
stuff like banks rows and columns
there's a venerable 2010 article from an
intact that's a good overview of what
SDRAM specifically is and how it
functions if you're curious about that
let's go through a few of these activate
who opens up a row of a bank a row must
be active for reading and writing data
if a row isn't active it is idle and if
a row is activated it stays that way
until a pre-charge command pre-charge it
closes the open row in one or all banks
by two separate commands putting them
into the idle State data is still stored
in idle banks but they must be activated
again before reading or writing read and
write are self explanatory with these
commands an auto pre charge flag can be
set to automatically pre charge the row
when it's done ZQ calibration
compensates for temperature and voltage
variation it can be a recurring command
but not frequently enough to make the
related timings important to us refresh
refreshes the charge and memory cells by
writing data back in place without
changing it DRAM is volatile memory
which means that it requires power to
store data bits are represented by
charges on capacitors which leak over
time if they aren't read from or written
to we'll discuss this more in the next
piece look at the tre Fi and T RFC
section for that all banks must be idle
or pre charged before a refresh the
jeddak or a joint electronic device
engineering council and solid-state
technology Association is an
organization that publishes standards
for ddr4 ddr5 SSDs mobile memory SD g DD
r6 and more
they're responsible for standardizing
and defining everything in our article
and this video from abbreviations to the
entire concept of ddr4 as part of this
jeddak publishes tables with baseline
timings for different Ram types several
of which are saved in SPD memory
manufacturers produced strictly Jetix
defined varieties of RAM like ddr3 1600
megahertz 1111 11:28 but can make them
capable of
higher speeds and market them as such
for example Corsair sells forty six
hundred megahertz memory which as of
this writing is a higher speed than
jeddak has defined for ddr4 when a newly
built system is powered on for the first
time the board will check SPD and
default to the best set of these jeddak
approved slow but safe speeds XMP is an
SPD extension its extreme memory profile
something that intel has largely pushed
here and it's a higher performance spec
that's jammed into the leftover space of
EEPROM on the memory modules these are
conceptually the same thing as JEDEC
profiles but their higher performance
and they're optimized by the memory
manufacturer itself that might be
someone like g.skill or Corsair or any
number of other memory manufacturers XMP
contains settings that memory
manufacturers say will probably work and
they might not be supported depending on
the quality of the CPUs IMC or the
motherboard or SOC and other components
this is a problem with things like that
ever mentioned Corsair forty six hundred
megahertz memory where although it can
achieve forty six hundred megahertz
you're starting to get to a point where
you're bending the CPU imc the memory
and also you're choosing a very specific
motherboard and also you want a high-end
CPU core so that you can get all the
overclockers right so it's kind of
getting into territory where there
really no guarantees and there's higher
frequency kits can almost be misleading
because it's pretty rare that you get
the ultra performance you might get
somewhere pretty close unless you've
really bend
everything in the product line so XMP
again is an SPD extension for
enthusiasts Ram the advertised speeds
are usually most easily attained by just
simply applying XMP some vendors call
these different names which we'll go
over momentarily XMP is technically an
Intel standard but an extreme memory
profile is literally just a list of
numbers that can be read into the system
from EEPROM so if the board allows it
for example some vendors like AMD boards
might have rebranded XMP as do CP or EOC
P or some of them just straight called
XMP even though it's kind of originally
was an Intel thing so XMP is a bit
redundant in a lot of cases because
we'll call it XMP profile which does
mean an extreme profile
just remember that nobody cares
including Intel otherwise they wouldn't
have abbreviated Xtreme with an X that's
what XMP is though and that's what SPD
is neither XMP nor SPD contain every
single timing and memory vendors can
only do so much tuning a lot of this
falls on motherboard makers according to
a Kingston representative quote we tune
the primary timings CLR CDR P and R ass
only the other timings are left alone at
jeddaks recommendations likely for the
MRC in regards to some specific sub
timings we asked about quote since they
are not in the SPD or XMP we can't
change them even if we need to this
lines up with our experiences in the
real world impact section of this
content even if memory manufacturers
wanted to go deeper there's a specific
and limited list of SPD entries so when
it comes down to it Ram doesn't set its
own frequency and timings bios does Ram
carries the marketing for what frequency
and times it should be able to hit and
you can apply an XMP profile redundantly
in order to achieve those timings in
that frequency easily but the BIOS
ultimately dictates how well this works
and that's why some boards just straight
won't work with different memory cuts
even if they're rather modest and their
timing goals on Intel boards this
element of the BIOS is called the MRC
and the MRC is one area where board
manufacturers can secure an advantage in
their performance so this is where
motherboards really differentiate
themselves it's not just the vrm or the
heatsink or all the different ports on
it it's what is their support for memory
and with this specific example the sheer
variety of ram and the differences
between samsung micron and hynek's the
three major memory suppliers who
actually make the chips that go on the
corsair g.skill memory the the amount of
difference between them is hideously
complex to adjust and people like the
Asus team spend a lot of time perfecting
their BIOS to try and get them as good
as possible with all these different
types of kits which is just plug and
play and a lot of trial and error so
memory and board manufacturers can work
together to bake in optimal timings for
each kid of memory and
most part these are determined if left
auto during post where they should
remain unchanged unless there are boot
failures at which point we start
deferring to things like memory training
memory training can appear kind of like
a dark magic of some kind
basically with memory training what
you're doing is forcing boot failures
until you can finally get into the
system it might be mostly stable you
might have some memory errors with
really intense applications but the idea
is that you are hitting a retry button
or just literally letting the
motherboard cycle and a lot of the time
if you just leave it alone the
motherboard will eventually cycle into a
successful boot for timings even if it
looks like it's failed the first maybe
three to five times we've had instances
with the retry button with high memory
overclocks for 3dmark record testing
we've had instances where just hitting
that retry button for five minutes well
sometimes eventually kick it into a boot
and that's because it's sitting there
retrying different timings over and over
until it finds one that is stable for
the motherboard and what's actually
happening is the IMC will try a variety
of different settings in an attempt to
stabilize the system not all of them are
timings and that's how to each boot of
the system it's an important point for
even non overclockers because again if
the memory seems unstable just cycle it
a few times and see what happens maybe
it'll work and you'll get lucky
retry buttons are an excellent tool for
making this work different kits have
different jeddaks standards so different
sub timings get loaded this is an issue
we've run into before we had two kits
identical in frequency and capacity but
with different latencies however the 16
18 18 36 Corsair kit somehow managed to
outperform our 14 14 14 34 g.skill kit
and tests after discussing this with
both manufacturers it turned out that
Corsair sticks were dual sided with
groups of 512 megabyte x 8 ICS
while G skills were single sided with
groups of 1 gigabyte by 8 ICS 512 by 8
is an older style so it actually has
tighter sub timings defined by JEDEC see
the what our timing section of our
article linked below the biggest culprit
in this case was T RFC or refresh cycle
time
we'll cover the full definition of this
in part two but for now the important
thing to know is that the value set by
JEDEC for coursers type of kit was 416
and it was 564 G skills when we adjusted
G skills down to the same TR FC value
that courser had with no further
adjustments the G skill kit pulled ahead
in performance and remained stable as
shown in our ashes of the singularity
benchmark results that we can put on the
screen or have had on the screen this is
an extreme case but it shows of both the
value of experimenting with sub timings
and the frustrations of benchmarking
memory if the ACS board happened to have
a set of optimized timing specifically
for this G skill kit it would have
performed better than the coarser kit
from the get-go but the aces board just
didn't have this specific kit optimized
with all that out of the way it's time
to talk about the primary timings that
you see listed everywhere there on the
product boxes the sticks of RAM
themselves and their standardized so
timings will be listed in a set format
its TCL TR CD TRP and tear ass with CR
sometimes listed as well going through
the primary timings first we have cache
latency TCL or T casts as it is commonly
known Wikipedia describes this as
follows the number of cycles between
sending a column address to the memory
and the beginning of the data in
response this is the number of cycles it
takes to read the first bit of memory
from a dram with the correct row already
open unlike the other numbers this is
not a maximum but an exact number that
must be agreed on between the memory
controller and the memory our
explanation or expansion on this is as
follows
cast latency is the most widely talked
about and compared memory timing these
CL timing is an exact number the base
time that it takes to get a response
from memory in the best possible
scenario described previously is
referred to as a page hit the other
primary ty means other than command rate
are minimums it's important to remember
that although we'll be talking about how
these times relate to reading data from
memory that's just one thing that they
affect the next one is Rast to cast
delay or TRC d in BIOS Wikipedia states
the following the
minimum number of clock cycles required
between opening a row of memory and
accessing columns within it would be TR
CD the time to read the first bit of
memory from a dram without an active row
is TR CD plus CL hour version to expand
upon this is that wrasse to Cass is one
potential delay to reads and writes TR
CD is the number of clock cycles it
takes to open a row and access a column
if a request for data is made when there
are no rows open referred to as a page
miss it will take at least TR CD plus CL
number of clock cycles for the CPU to
receive the first bit of data in
response the next one is rope recharge
time or TRP with PDS as quotes the
minimum number of clock cycles required
between issuing the pre-charge command
and opening the next row the time to
read the first bit of memory from a dram
but with the wrong row open is TRP plus
TR CD plus CL and our version expands in
this way if the wrong Row is open a page
miss it needs to be closed or pre
charged then the next needs to be opened
and then the column within the row needs
to be accessed this therefore takes TRP
plus TR CD plus CL time to complete row
active time as our next item or tear ass
wikipedia says the minimum number of
clock cycles required between a row
active command and issuing a pre charge
command is row active time this is the
time needed to internally refresh the
row and overlaps with TR c d and SDRAM
modules it is simply TR CD plus CL
otherwise approximately equal to TR CD
plus two times CL our expansion on this
is that it's also known as active to pre
charge delay or minimum at wrasse active
time the first equation for SDRAM is the
relevant one here but it should be more
than that we've seen multiple different
true ways to calculate T wrasse but
given the complexity of memory
operations good old trial and error
remains the easiest for example we
somehow booted with
memory at sixteen sixteen sixteen twenty
six and that doesn't make sense by
anyone's rules if you were to check
forums online but it worked
command rate is the last one it's known
as CR or CMD CB CT CPD all kinds of
things and for AMD it's defined as the
amount of time in cycles between when a
dram chip is selected and a command is
executed to TCR or to T command rate can
be very beneficial for stability with
high memory clocks or for a four dimm
configuration it's also known as the
command period this will either be one T
or two T on modern memory with one T
being faster despite the unique T
notation this is measured in clock
cycles like the other timings there's
generally a very small performance Delta
between the two options that's it for
the ultra basics this is an extremely
hard topic to boil down part of the
problem we run into even just
researching this is that as you find
definitions for different aspects of
memory you almost need more definitions
just to understand the definitions so
it's very difficult to boil it down at
the end of the day the primary timings
are pretty straightforward and simple
and what they do see the previous
animation for an explanation of that
it's just that once you really start
getting into things like secondary and
tertiary the trouble is there's a lot of
play between the timings how they
interact with each other how one being
higher might mean another one can't be
certain values and things like that and
we'll try and boil these down further
check back for part two where we will
explore at least the secondary timings
if not tertiary as well and then we'll
define the rest later if we have to but
that should get you started on timings
and on memory it's a really interesting
subject that's important and up until
the last year or so has been pretty
uninteresting for most people but
because of risings very peculiar early
interactions with memory with the first
launch of Rison it kind of memory timing
started to get some attention and then
you start looking at Intel overclocking
you can push the CPU reasonably to 5
gigahertz in a lot of cases but get
stuck on memory performance so timings
are coming back into interest I think
