we're the troubleshoot some sound on the
side channel I think it's been troubled
shot so how let me know if it's working
I want to send this link out on Twitter
and stuff like that but let me know if
everything looks okay to you and we
should pretty much be good to go at this
point
so what we're testing today I'll keep an
eye on chat for a minute it is live yes
thank you
it's working it's working it's working
one person said it's not working
screw you everyone else says it's
working trying to trick me alright so we
are revisiting a very interesting cooler
I'm just sharing this on Twitter we are
alive go watch
so this cooler gave us some trouble
previously some of it was my fault and
some of it was the coolers fault if she
found out basically the top of the
cooler this thing right here is it's
really interesting cooler I like it a
lot actually just for how weird it is
but the top of it has some pieces that
screw into the fin stack so it's
basically a semi open-loop cooler it's
an air cooler plus water cooling and and
so what it does is it takes liquid in
from an open loop pushes it through with
a fin stack and the inlet like manifold
basically where water comes in was loose
it has four screws they were not
tightened and so it leaked all the way
down the fins and then then we ran away
and went to Taiwan for two weeks so
we're back now alright someone says
light needs a diffuser a little harsh I
don't
there are diffusers on both of these so
I don't know it deal with it we can't do
any color correction lives so alright so
yeah basically we're finally gonna
retest this thing and we have not done
any testing yet with with just the air
cooler with all the liquid removed so
I'll be doing that probably later and I
think as the stream ends I'll be
publishing a video with our review
basically of the cooler so
yeah it's very very interesting the top
plate is too strong I mean has that
changed from normally things just the
camera angles different sorry guys deal
with it alright so yeah it's really fun
I'll show you the setup in a moment I
guess quick mentions here so this is the
cooler it's the PC cooler W 120 it's
$100 you bought on aliexpress and as I
noted it's it's particularly interesting
because it has some of these are normal
copper heat pipes that don't have
open-loop liquid in them of course
copper heat pipes do have a liquid in
them but it's not not the same as we're
talking about with open-loop so these
two Center pipes right here go down
through the cooler like normally into a
cold plate which I haven't opened yet
and I hope we can do that on stream
today maybe depending on time so we
might actually open this cooler today if
we don't we'll do separate video but I'd
like to open it cuz I want to see if
there are actually any micro fins in
there or if it's just like pushing water
through a copper plate because that's
not gonna be nearly as effective
obviously as more surface area for
microphones so anyway water goes down
one comes out the other and these are
normal copper heat pipes there's a fan
on the other side the fans are actually
pretty high CFM we tested it on the
previous stream and it was up there
definitely but it's a cheap fan so it's
a bit noisy as cheap plastic so the
endurance is kind of questionable
so anyway PC coolers the company W 120
is the product it was shown seven years
ago at Computex and we never heard about
it since then and this is oh yeah people
are already pointing out the five
hundred watt claim on there so this is
the inside of the box the reason I'm
showing you this you might see some
yellow aging in there and I think that's
pretty much evidence to how long it sat
on a shelf before we rescued it because
this thing again shown first time seven
years ago and I've never seen a single
review of it I don't think and the
throne page that came with it is
completely hard and I think I actually
still have some let me see if we do I
can demonstrate for you yes okay
so this will be in the review that we'll
be publishing towards the end of the
stream this is the thermal paste it's
one gram and they call it a - is the
name oh yeah I'm wearing the new shirt
by the way you can buy this on the store
now that we're getting a zoom on my
chest so if you like the shirt design
its stored on gamers nexus net pick it
up anything you buy during the stream I
will shout out your first name and where
you're from and of course we greatly
appreciate the support during the stream
so this is the new blue print shirt
anyway yeah one gram allegedly a two and
I don't know if they claim yeah they say
four watts per meter Kelvin now here's
the problem this stuff is so old that it
basically comes out pre cured and like
hardened that's that's what you get I
mean if I if I can push it around and
it's not spreading this is just like a
plastic ball at this point so we tested
with their thermal paste and with our
standardized paste and it is a
significant difference between this
which officer speaks to shelf life of
pace as they cure it's not very good so
we'll show that all that gets published
in the video as the stream ends but
we'll do some live testing today as well
just to show you how it all works and
yeah so let me let me show you the
system itself and then we will do a
couple more notes before testing and we
can get into testing as people fill the
chat to move this light back so Andrews
gonna go hand cam here to give us a
moment
all right so here's the system I have a
thermocouple in here right now just a
straight thermometer actually and this
is just our pump and reservoir combo
currently we're hooked up to so
thermocouples in here just for water
temperature you'll see why that's
relevant later we have quick disconnects
added those in line and I'm so glad I
did so quick disconnects currently
allowing us to connect to this over here
to the right which is a super fat
thermal take three sixty millimeter
radiator with relatively high end fans
on it including an a12 and so this also
teetering by the way it's way over the
load limit of this pillar so this is
hooked up we have a 360 rad plus three
fans
hooked up to a 100 dollar cooler with a
pump and reservoir so we're well over
$200 for total price we're probably
approaching 300 for this cooler so it
better be damn good because you're in
you're in beginner level level open-loop
territory with this and we already
tested all this stuff like I said we're
going to go through some of it on the
stream just to show you and then I'm
hoping we can just QDC this hit the
disconnects and take it apart as we go
or just remove the radiator from the
loop if you wanted to see that testing
live as well so anyway right now ambient
is 25.1 and the liquid temperature is 27
just for reference it's kind of hotter
in here today than normally so that's
the cooler if we can get a closer shot
of this I think it'd be interesting so
this is here's our fittings it takes G
1/4 inch fittings and barbs and so we've
got where you actually using the ones
that came with it and then we have ek
ones elsewhere and just zip ties to
apply some pressure because didn't come
with anything to clamp down on the barbs
to make sure liquid doesn't leak out
which was another problem we had and
then under this cover plate there are
basically it's an inlet manifold and
four screws hold it in and they are
super loose the first time which allowed
leakage but that's been corrected and
then a normal fin stack with actually
pretty fat fins not a good thing not
very high fin density plus a fan on the
other side so you a fan blowing through
a tower
cooler with water cooling via external
pump and bring your own radiator
basically as the set up so that's what
we have going on and I'll just move back
over to the set now and we can go
through the rest where's this light go
exactly here okay
so that's the setup check chat in a
moment and I think I think we'll get to
do some actual testing this time since
we've trouble shot at all someone says
ice cubes in the reservoir today it's
drawn with the means I'm really glad to
see we have persistence between streams
though and that people actually watch it
so a couple stupid chats $2.00 from
Nathan Tipton who says that light is
fine it's Chester hallo
two British pounds from you can he do
that
good to see you again it's just what CPU
is it it's actually not the so d98 exe
it's a 59 30 K is our standardized CPU
cooler test CPU because all it needs to
do is generate heat the CPU and
motherboard do that really reliably so
we've kept it around a long time that's
why we have so much data on this test
bench if you want to know the rest of
the components of the test bench look up
any of our CPU cooler reviews the Kraken
X 72 is probably one of the most recent
you can look it up and check the testing
methods or test parts of you're curious
and I think you can't do that also says
nipple cam or no Murch purchase Brendan
$5 is the new shirt of tri-blend so it's
basically a dual blend if you can call
it that so this this is the new shirt
it's a bell in canvas and I think it's
like 52 percent cotton and yes 50%
cotton 48 percent polyester
it's a Heather so if you know like the
have any any other Heather shirt same
idea and there's a logo it's actually
pretty cool so this is a logo we did in
blender and with some CAD software so
you can actually measure the angles and
the and the lengths and everything
properly for the logo I don't know did
we does this come out accurate on the
shirt itself or just in the design I
think it's actually accurate on the
shirt but I'm not positive
let's let's see this is supposed to be
55 millimeters so is that that's pretty
damn close
51 I'll take that considering it's
printed on a shirt so those are the
measurements show that for the logo
anyway
and we're pretty happy with the shirt
really cool design it's the blueprint
design on store that gamers nexus net if
you want to pick it up and yeah it's
basically a dual blend so let's see it's
not 100% cotton how cheap are you it's
not it
okay so printing for this type of
printing it just looked better on
Heather and actually we like the shirt
better to also try blends are way more
expensive than cotton so anyway next
next one let's see the next question was
Alex please use this to buy a bag of
catnip for the cat thank you the $5 will
go a long way towards that tray Emma $5
please invite pinnacle Ridge on
livestream Martin Parker $5 for ice
there can be no excuses alright so also
someone says that this shirt looks dope
if I weren't broke I'd buy it well I
definitely appreciate you liking the
design that does that go a long way so
we appreciate that let's let's get
something set up here so right now we'll
just run a scripted standardized bench
test that I have for the cooler and all
I'm gonna do is tell it to fire off a
bench with a we are going to use tab
there we go okay so we're a toes login
here it's pretty reliable for that I've
already set all that up and then we have
a torture test right now it's doing an
idle login for part of our automated
testing and you can see here our
temperatures so we're in the 30s for the
CPU is what we're gonna do is average
all the core temperatures as this gets
going and see what we reach for the
Aliexpress PC cooler w 120 so I
think we can go over some numbers in a
moment show what it's up against for
other coolers and then we'll kind of
look at the numbers for this one since
we've already run those tests and I'm
gonna skip the idol test here and we're
just gonna fire off prime95 and and let
it take it away at this point so a p95
is going automated test is going we'll
keep an eye on the temperature it's
already jumping pretty hard to the 60s
so let me pull up some data and see how
exactly this compares to some other
coolers as we go and let me just tweet
this out one more time live testing the
alley Express PC cooler all lowercase W
120 very weird
water plus air cooler check at the link
okay the rest of you were here first
alright so for previous numbers let me
see what I can pull up that we can share
on screen CPU bench coolers it's a very
it I really enjoyed working with this
cooler just because it is so different
it's not very good but it's different
equalities pretty low build quality that
is performance you'll see is mixed and
not that not that mixed I guess and then
the rest is really up to your water
cooling components that you've hooked up
to it so let me pull some data here I'm
gonna hide the data for the PC cooler
part will kind of not spoil that for now
hide hide hide okay so what is this this
chart will work we can show this one if
you want a pen over here when ready so
right here we have a chart of some
results and you don't have to look at it
too closely I guess but where we're at
right now is we're at 65 with an ambient
temperature of like 25 so we're kinda in
the 40 degree Celsius range for Delta T
over mu and that puts us down here cuz
this is all delta T over ambient so we
were factory now ambient temperature to
a degree it's linear
once you start getting more than like 10
degrees or so it's nonlinear but we're
not more than 10 degrees difference in
ambient temperatures
so EVGA CLC 120 2500 rpm there's a 120
millimeter radiator in liquid cooler at
41 dials at t / ambient and our cooler
right now is at about 42 41 42 delta T /
ambient for the 360 millimeter radiator
and we'll see how that goes
as it as it carries on so that's that's
some quick data for you doesn't look so
good for it right now but I think as we
keep testing you'll you'll see why that
is a really fun product though so I'm
gonna go let me check the chat and
everything see what everyone's saying
and I'll talk more about this cooler so
someone says let's see for I sticking it
yet so that one I'd always said I don't
why says what's the minimum donation for
a haircut stream very high you can't do
that what do we want mouse mats 35 inch
by 12 inch please we're looking into
that actively we have actually we have a
sample on the way for our first mousepad
design and we'll go into mouse mats
after that so definitely keep an eye out
for for Mouse mats and mouse pads from
us we've heard the requests and we're
making them we sold the mod mat of
course if you want a building service
for PC parts that's on store that game
is XS net
it's an anti-static build service with
wiring diagrams it's got a grid for GPU
tear downs all that stuff on it really
good quality products we're super happy
with how it's turned out print quality
is great and you can pick one up on
backorder the next shipment comes in
within a few weeks I think so we should
be shipping out within a couple of weeks
hopefully so if you you kept the order
now you're definitely on the list for
the next round $5 from Dean Pennington
who says I spilled a pad thai all over
my mod mat cleaning recommendations how
badly did it get stained I guess soap
and water is probably the safest it just
just straight soap and water don't rub
too hard on any of the areas with the
ink it should hold up pretty well to
just soap and water
shouldn't really be a problem but
hopefully that works and then maybe air
dry outside or something I don't know
you if you want you can if that's not
working for you sending the email the
support at gamers Nexus net and we'll
try and figure something out to help you
out with it with cleaning it next one
Jack reitman says I am at work five
dollars I'm at work if I get fired for
watching you test a piece of
Aliexpress cooler the blame is squarely
on your shoulders I accept it
because this cooler is amazing and it's
completely worth testing live which is
right now oh by the way we are
approaching 70 degrees for the core
temperatures so I'll remind you this
thing's not overclocked that far
I think it's 3.8 gigahertz on the 59 30
K and I want to say it's about a hundred
and fifty watt heat load if you remember
the cooler on the back the box anyway it
says where is it thermal power 500 Watts
500 watts cooling they say we've got
about 150 on here right now once okay
let's be fair 163 and 163 core timer is
already in the 70s if we increase that
to 500 watts there's no way this thing
would still be up it'd be it'd be way
past t.j.maxx so we're in the 70s
already before doing a delta T different
but after that we're probably I don't
know we're in fifties something like
that this is with a let's see let me
double check a couple of things but this
is with a 360 radiator and three fairly
high on fans
how does this do pumps on everything's
going what is the liquid temperature
liquid temperature right now it's 30
degrees it's actually not bad
because ambient is about 25 and here
like with Tom set 29.5 so really not
terrible for liquid temperature and
that's because of this 360 radiator
without it would really be suffering
right now as you'll see in some of our
data later because with just some of the
original live stream we asked you all to
participate and asked okay so for this
thing do you want us to hook it up just
to a pump and reservoir and do basically
direct link or do you want us to add
radiators and everyone wanted pump and
reservoir and we added radiators later
as seen here pumping reservoir really
doesn't cut it for this because there's
just not enough airflow over the liquid
I mean that the actual exposure the
surface area exposure of liquid to a fan
if you don't have a radiator is
extremely small because you have two
pipes and I don't know I don't know how
big they're I want to say maybe eight
millimeters two pipes that run straight
down eight to ten millimeters and the
air is just blowing over those and then
you're hoping there's some conduction
maybe it's I would hope these pipes are
soldered to the fins so you get some
conduction yes but there's not a lot of
exposure of the of anything containing
water to air so what happens is the
liquid temperatures can run up something
like approaching 40 degrees or beyond
but approaching 40 C for liquid
temperature within our original testing
ambient of about 21 because we weren't
running all the streaming equipment
that's pretty bad so adding the radiator
brings us down to 29 as you saw a moment
ago on on this bench right now 29 water
temperatures really really not bad but
the rest of it is kind of rough so a
couple questions here Noorie Rivera
what's he P you are you running what are
the out-of-the-box thermals did fantex
not view where is snowflake in midnight
did you hug them but before that this
message is brought to you by the GN desk
our channel no worry getting in every
single GN meme I think we've ever had in
one message I it was definitely worth
the $10 I hope you feel the same Thank
You nori so what cpu are you running not
a 79 80 XE not an 88 or 9 G which I've
memorized specifically because you all
memed me into memorizing that name but
the 59 30 K out of the box thermals are
currently if you consider testing out of
the box
74 before delta T subtraction and next
one Ace of Spades 878 good name bad
thermals PC cooler should have Page who
at copy tags it's copy tax 2011 that was
a long time ago and I don't know that PC
cooler got any any Western coverage at
all actually I forget how we even found
this thing I think we're just looking
around on the on Aliexpress 99 Justin
Murphy I have an ugly desk can I get a
mod mat in a custom size we can't do
custom sizes it's really expensive
because there's a minimum order quantity
because we don't control we don't like
own a factory we give them all the specs
and quality control it but ultimately we
have to make a certain amount of mod
mats so it's 4 feet by 2 feet for now
we're working on a medium sized one and
hopefully we'll have some progress on
that soon so if it's too big at 4 by 2
then keep an eye out we'll have a
smaller one for you last one before I
kind of move back to some of the testing
$5 from Martin Parker who says have you
considered following market trends by
adding RGB and tempered glass to the mod
mat do you think it would affect air
flow and thermals well you know I think
what we really need to do is add a
vertical GPU mount to the mod mat
because that is where everything finds
its vertical GP amount close to tempered
glass something about that combination
just makes a lot of sense to me actually
on that note we are recording something
on vertical GP amounts today after this
dream on thermal performance for
distance from the glass it's really
interesting actually how much of an
impact there is if you bring the video
card like an extra three inches away
from the glass it's crazy so we'll have
a video on that filming today go up soon
and okay let's look back at this for a
minute so we're still running through
cycles on prime and we what we do is
take an average after it's all done and
the average is via for cycling and how
well a cooler is able to soak the
performance or the the heat load rather
so we can actually see over time does
the cooler do better or worse than its
competitors that we're testing against
and for this one
let me check some of the temperatures
here ambient is still about the same
water temperature is still 30 or so so
let's kind of bring this over here
twenty nine point nine that is that
visible and means reading a bit higher
because I'm moving the thermocouple
around right now but 25 when I'm not
messing with it
it's 25 and then also I'm just putting
it in the air path and then 29.9 for the
thermometer that's in the inlet of the
reservoir up here so water temperature
is actually pretty good right now and
that's again because they're a radiator
so going back over the parts if you're
new a couple new people join the stream
we have a three hundred sixty millimeter
radiator with three 120 millimeter fans
to fairly high end Corsair ones and very
high on Noctua a 12 and those are
blasting I think we're noise normalized
to 40 DBA right now on the cooler so it
is actually going to perform worse than
if we maxed everything out but noise
normalizing gives us a really cool data
point that we can use to see how does
this perform and what is the cooling
efficiency at a given noise level for
any any cooler on the benchmark so we'll
compare these numbers to all the other
40 DB a noise normalize numbers
momentarily and just going back over it
again the tower cooler is back here it's
got a couple of heat pipes that go or
water pipes that go straight down and
then we have our open-loop setup going
to radiator into the pump and reservoir
so that's the whole thing and I'll be
able to share some numbers with you
shortly this test is kind of nearing the
end for the first run we allow it to run
for
I think it's 25 to 30 minutes or so
something like that and that works very
well to basically saturate any cooler
thermally so we kind of make sure we run
run up against the the limits of
everything Charles Riley $2 if you use
tap water how long for a cup of tea so
that it's that a meme I feel like what's
a meme I missing
I'm sorry we use distilled water for it
I'm sure that that doesn't play into the
meme how did the test without radiators
do while I can answer that so what does
chat think here about about this thing
we've got let me read you some numbers
so let's look at 120-millimeter cooler
so for a 120 we have actually let's look
at a 140 the kraken x 4270 hundred RPM
was at about 41 degrees delta T / ambien
so how well do you think the pc cooler
does where where would you place it just
take a stab doesn't matter if you're
right or wrong if we have an X 42 140
millimeter CLC at 41 delta T over
ambient basically where do you think the
PC cooler W 120 lands with no radiator
above or below let's do that above or
below the X 42 that's what I want you to
answer and that's without the radiator
so let me know what you thought your
guess is for that most people are saying
lower
so when you say lower we should clarify
that above or below in the literal sense
as in if you say above it means a higher
temperature not not higher up on the
chart but higher temperature below a
lower temperature so we're seeing a lot
of hot icy hotter for sure lower above
below above it's actually pretty evenly
split right now more above below in
ranking above and temps yep so all right
with a fan on it yes with a fan on it
and just no radiator no radiator no
radiator fans all right so lots of hot
hot hot just hotter than using a potato
above thermal throttling
below okay so what we ended up with let
me see if I can find one of these charts
yes so we've got a video that'll go live
as the stream ends that you should all
check out with the full review of this
cooler but I want to pull up some of the
results right now once the server lets
me log in and we can go over how it did
this one during this test it's still in
the seventy seventy five seventy seven
something like that so it's pretty hot
right now
I think that's for noise normalized at
forty DBA and I'll pull up some of those
numbers for you because it's it's pretty
interesting and then we'll take it apart
once we get through some of the basic
testing so yeah w1 20 really fun to work
with
absolutely not something I'd end up
recommend buying it is after all one
hundred dollars and it took like five
weeks to ship here from China so worth
the wait absolutely worth a hundred
dollars for anyone who's not streaming
or making videos now definitely not and
well unless you want just like a really
unique piece of hardware that's not
particularly good but there's plenty of
that out there already so let's see
results please server and in the
meantime I'll get up the 40 DBA testing
so let's let me login to this one more
time
also we have a couple of store purchases
that I need to read out for for those of
you who pick stuff up
we appreciate it it's a huge support all
right coolers a PC cooler hybrid charts
and let's pull up the noise normalize
chart we can we can zoom in on this
where's my zoom there it is alright so
so here we go you'll see these numbers
in the proper video later is that okay
on camera two got the video review
coming out after the stream ends this is
noise normalized so it's that forty DBA
measured at twenty inches and that
allows us to see how effective is a
cooler as compared to
it's neighbors if they're all set to the
same noise level so if you have a cooler
that's really quiet to a degree this one
notwithstanding we can bring its fan
speeds up and that'll allow us to let it
cool better and if something's really
loud because they use just loud poor
design fans or something like that we're
forced to bring the RPMs down EVGA CLC
120 is a great example to get 40 DBA we
had the brand down to 1700 rpm from 2500
rpm so we're in the normal chart this
would place much much higher because of
brute force realistically you're not
going to use fans with their 50 decibels
is no one wants that
so we normal normalize it for noise at
40 DBA and in this instance the EC LC
120 is that forty eight point seven
degrees delta T over ambient the NZXT
m22 one of the worst CLC's we've looked
at recently fifty four point two degrees
delta T over ambien the PC cooler w 120
with no radiator this is again 40 DB a
fifty eight point two and that's even
with our improved thermal paste so stock
with their original thermal like plastic
that they have this thing right here
with that I it was like 10 plus degrees
higher than what the thermal paste we
use because it had cured this stuff was
sitting on the shelf for so long that it
just hardened and became useless
so there's your results it's at the
bottom of the charts and that's with no
radiator let's look at do I have the
result on here yes result with the
radiator and with our standardized paste
that one with a 360 rads at 45 or so so
more than a 10 degree drop in thrall
performance front what in a good way
from the one without the radiator so I
drop in two forty five yeah that's a 360
rad
so now actual 360s are up here this is
an ek Phoenix this is a proper open loop
basically semi open loop 1400 RPM 40 DBA
same noise levels 360 with I think
Vardar fans and that's at 35 verses a
phat pretty high-end thermal take
radiator with high-end fans and just a
bottlenecked cooler at 45 so about it
degree difference and the reason for
that difference is because of the cold
plates so we become bottle necked on the
cold plate which I hope we can show you
as we take things apart and and we look
at chat again now so yeah we become
bottlenecks on the cold plate just
because there's probably either there
aren't micro fins in there or they're
not very dense and that's where all the
cooling performance comes from on the
anything with water because if you just
push water through a copper plate which
I have a good example of that just push
water through a copper plate like these
these we'll talk about later
then yes it will still cool it will
still pull heat away but there's no
service area in there it's just a
channel if even that and we're relying
on no big loss we rely on whatever
service of copper the water can touch in
the time that it's in this chamber
before it gets pulled out so this is a
great example of a water cooler that's
while interesting not effective because
there's no internal service area there
no micro fins and I'm sure we have
examples of those lying around here as
well I think there might be one right
here now I salvaged it so that's why the
performance is the way it is but let me
read a couple more notes from people and
riffin rest in peace copper black yes
yes and the we might test that one at
some point
okay couple more messages super chats
while this is finalizing its test it
looks like super chats we got one from
PC gamers Hawaii internet cafe in
eSports Center $20 thank you PC gamers
Hawaii I suppose if you live in Hawaii
I guess that's an eSports Center check
it out maybe would you be interested in
coming to a Hawaii convention to do a
panel on custom computer building a
custom loop etc and what's he requiring
compensation well that would be a pretty
expensive trip for us from the East
Coast so send me an email I guess
and we can figure it out but just flying
there's pretty expensive let me know
that send us an email got one from it's
on in the contact form on the website
Alex $2.00 can I put an ftw2 hybrid
radiator on dry ice
that's heat I mean you could like as in
yeah as soon as possible
can I put an ftw2 hybrid radiator on dry
ice yes condensation might become a
concern it's pretty well insulated
already because I can't run out of that
cooler contact 2v yes it does I think it
does contact the vram be a copper plate
that touches the pump block so be
careful condensation but you can do it
Justin Murphy $5 you should work with
NZXT or any system monitor to
incorporate external thermal sensors
into an on screen display yeah we've
actually there's a company that sent us
some stuff that can do that I need to
set it up though it uses a Raspberry Pi
we might have something like that in the
future our ml 37 $2.00 when will the x3
99 creation motherboard from MSI come
out great question they didn't give us a
firm date at Computex it was all
basically uh they're still making some
changes to it so we did a video on that
motherboard if you haven't seen it it's
actually a pretty cool motherboard it's
the x2 99 creation it's an MSI board
perhaps for basically threader for two
and the reason it's interesting is
because the entire top of the board is a
hundred percent VR app because thread
over two you're looking at something
like 250 to 300 watt TDP depending I
think on what the final spec is for the
product but that's what the motherboard
makers have told me they're specified
they're building their prm's for and so
if they're worried about that that vrm
to handle that much heat load without
having vrm thermal issues it's gonna be
massive and they actually are starting
to run out of physical board space
really interesting motherboard but i do
not know when it's coming out
unfortunately I would assume close to
August or in August does that's when
threader for two launches Justin Murphy
$4.99 can we get you know
turn this on there we go can we get a
teardown crystal that plugs into an RGB
header maybe with some sort of mounting
for inside a PC so this is the teardown
crystal if you haven't seen it we gave
these some of these away as awards I
wrote on them autograph the bass wrote
what the award was gave it to Noctua
for having the quote least amount of RGB
 had a booth award that's what we
gave Knox with this year I think they
had zero RGB devices which is actually I
really greatly admire and they asked
when they got it
he said does it have RGB LEDs so what a
great irony that would have been our
medium base has RGB LEDs for the
medium-sized crystal the large one it
doesn't rotate for the retail products
but the large one has just white LEDs
and we thought it looks better that way
it looks really good lit up white but
RGB headers a funny idea and if there's
interest we could certainly look into it
so a couple more super chats we'll get
back to the testing Kenneth Madison gave
twenty DKK I'm not sure what is DKK
someone let me know
so no rip ltte to this time no
unfortunately not but i have been
speaking with alpha cool about getting a
chiller in so i'm hoping we can get a
chiller in and Linus and team open
invitation as soon as you're ready let
me know we let me just tap the ground
because this is three thousand dollars
I'm about to touch so why not so this
has been just lying there waiting lonely
waiting for somebody to challenge it
it's the Titan V that we used in the
repel TT stream with the liquid metal
removed mostly with the open loop cooler
removed all that stuff and it's just
it's you know Linus and Alex and anyone
else that LTTE when you try to go to
sleep at night I want you to think about
how lonely and sad this Titan V is
waiting for somebody to challenge it so
that it can be brought back into action
on another repel DT astrium for when we
next need to compete for a high score in
3d mark which is about as valuable as
points and whose line is it anyway
Martin Parker last one reading for a
moment $5 which would have better
thermals a good liquid cooler or an air
cooler where instead of using fans
they're placed on the roof of the car
going 70 miles per hour okay let's let's
think about this we have to make a lot
of assumptions here in physics there's
the assume a spherical cow joke so we
are going to do that which would have
better thermals a good liquid cooler for
an air cooler where instead of fans it's
on the roof of a car going 30 miles per
hour so you're pushing I suppose roughly
70 mile per hour wind effectively
through the the cooler ah if we assume
that everything else is equal and that
the cooler can like mount and not be
ripped off and stuff like that I guess
it would depend on the heat load because
ultimately you'll be limited to some
degree do a car cooler video you'll be
limited to some degree by the cold plate
on the air cooler and how well it can
bring that heat up to the fins because
if you can't get the heat into the fins
fast enough for all that air to really
do its job then it's not gonna matter
it's not gonna add any any real
performance I do think that's a funny
idea that oh and if we were a bigger
media outlet like ltte perhaps we could
actually test it but alas I don't know
that I have the budget to do to do a CPU
cooler on top of a car test cuz I'd
probably take a lot of time to figure
out really fun idea there I would have
to say if I'm gonna pick a side I would
have to say you know if it's a good air
cooler like one of the Heian octo ones I
think you could get them pretty close
like maybe tied maybe slightly better
with enough airflow if there's all that
surface area and finden city and
everything I think you would you would
pass the radiator so next one that's
okay that's it for now if you have more
super chat or questions whatever send in
a super chat I'll read it as we go
through testing and stuff like that so
this finished its test it survived it
didn't crash to its credit and I will
pull up some numbers for you and show
what's going on with this thing
so for let's pull up the all thermals
chart this is a good one so we can pan
over here
I apologize for filming a screen however
we will be publishing the video with
this chart after the stream ends or
towards the end of stream something like
that so you can watch the full review of
this particularly interesting cooler the
PC cooler w 120 so this is our all
thermals result chart how does that look
on camera is that fairly readable and
hopefully you can read it okay but I'll
read it for you if not PC cool W 120 no
radiator with the stock paste so as a
reminder that's this thing the a2
allegedly 4 watt per meter Kelvin
compound that has hardened into Plato
so with that pasted without using our
standardized paste its 57.2 degrees
which is the worst thing we've tested on
this chart short of things where we've
intentionally handicapped them with
lower fan speeds that puts it below this
is with no radio remind you that puts it
below the EVGA CLC 120 we're not noise
normalize here so this is flat out this
is the best anything can do unless we've
limited the fan speed intentionally EVGA
COC 120 though 1050 rpm so with the rpm
cut by 1500 it's the same temperature
that's pretty disappointing but if we
replace the paste and go with
standardized paste for us that's an ASA
Tec compound with no radiator we are at
W 120 is at 54 degrees Celsius over
ambient which puts it about on par with
the NZXT M 22 at 20 50 rpm which is not
cooler we did not particularly like so
there you have it next listing PZ cooler
w123 60 millimeter radiator standardized
paste is that 41 degrees over ambient
and that puts it as comparable with a a
280 millimeter or the actually 280
millimeter at really low rpms or a
coarser h100 IV to at 1500 rpm which is
41 degrees so 360 rata 3
and fans this is basically 300 plus
dollars of hardware right here pump has
everything you have to buy it all
separately you only get the cooler for a
hundred bucks performing worse than $100
CLC 240 millimeter so that kind of gives
you an idea of where everything is I
think that's the highest-scoring want on
the chart for the PC cooler yes it is
so that's that one see if I have a
couple more charts here we can show me
water temperature or something like that
how do I scroll there we go water
temperature so for this one what we're
showing I'm gonna if you I'm gonna leave
it that size if that's okay because
otherwise the chart changing will break
so this is water temperature zero to 100
scale this is without subtracting
ambient so ambient temperatures 21
degrees Celsius during all these tests
time on the bottom zero to I don't know
about 2000 seconds or so and what you
have is a great example of why radiators
matter for this kind of thing because
blue the blue line is the stock cooler
standardized paste so using ours the
good stuff and no radiator and that ends
up a bit over 25 for starting and it
starts kind of let's see peaking at
around and I've got the numbers
somewhere but maybe in the 30s or so
somewhere around there actually it's a
bit higher maybe 36 I think is what it
came out to without a radiator and then
the orange line is the original paste no
radiator that had a problem because it's
just not pulling the heat away fast
enough the red line is the standard pay
standardized paste with a 360 rad 3 high
on fans and you can see it never really
tips above 25 degrees Celsius so liquid
temperature really matters and having a
radiator changes that performance
greatly so that that's pretty important
metric these are the isolated tests for
the PC cooler w 120 so this is just only
the PC cooler w 120 the aliexpress
special cooler we picked up and just to
recap delta T / ambien stock pays 60
one no radiator 40db a normalised 58°
stock with controlled paste 54 so these
two 61 vs 54 you're at like a six degree
difference or so for a bit more for
going to a better pace than what they
shift with because it was so old
radiator 40 DBA so this is what you
compare for this one actually oh yeah
no radiator 40 DBA vs. radiator 40 DBA
45 verses 58 so the radiator helps
significantly radiator 100% 41 so
there's some numbers there noise levels
we'll get into in that video it's not
too impressive really it gets a bit loud
though so that's some of the charts
we've got a video will publish on all
that but I think we can do maybe a
teardown on this cooler or something
like that hopefully during stream let me
check is there a GN discord yes
patreon.com slash gamers Nexus it will
give you access to the discord if you go
to the patreon API and linked your
discord account that will give you
access to our discord server where we
have a pretty awesome community and I
try to get in there as often as possible
and hang out with everyone but it is a
patreon access based it's it's one of
the perks of patreon we got to give
people something and it'd be
overwhelming without that so if you want
to join that's where you can do it we
have a who is this the Martin or yeah
the Martin one two three
what CPU is it is Ice Cube happening
today
no ice cube today I'm sorry one day
we'll have to do like an ice cube in
reservoir stream because it's so highly
demanded Jordan P $1 no message thank
you Jordan
pyro CF $2 can you break the tent here
flat barrier with this gotta get that
meme into you know now you can its
having trouble at 160 watts for the 59
30 K I don't know that it can do the
advertised 500 watts under like any
circumstances this is a good one Marko 5
CHF hi Steve what's your personal home
computer setup and how do you cool it
it's awful it's an FX 8350 and the way I
cool it is by underclocking it and under
volt in it and that is how it is cooled
it's killed two radiators at this
or to CLC's at this point $2 from not
tie ab do you use hair conditioner if so
how often
no I use thermal paste and every four
hours so we're due soon alright so let
me see if there there a couple of store
purchases and then as we as we read
through those I'm going to take this
thing off and we'll start taking it
apart so if you want to get a shout out
with your name first name and your where
you're from you can go to store that
cameras in excess net we have our
brand-new blue print shirt they're not
too many of these in stock right now if
they're popular today will will order
some more but really cool blueprint
design shirt for the GM logo we've got
the tear down crystals of course as
always behind me over here which we gave
a couple out as awards at the show the
vendors have to earn theirs but you can
buy one and then we have the mod mat of
course which is our most popular item
right now and that's for a PC building
modding stuff like that so Dean from
Massachusetts bought the blue print
shirt Thank You Dean you are one of the
first I think five or six to buy one
next one is un or Evan UN from the UK
who bought also the blue print shirt and
I think I got a low stock notice after
that one because we were pretty limited
on that run we sold another blue print
shirt to Jason from California Thank You
Jason very much hope you all like the
shirts we were pretty happy with the
design and then I think we've got one
more in here to go through this one is
Sean from New York who picked up one of
the tear down crystal statues the medium
size with LED base that's the RGB LED
one which I should have given to Noctua
just for irony
and then the anniversary edition 15
ounce ceramic mug which I've got right
here with some dead memory in it I hope
I hope that hurts you all very much
because that's probably was $200 memory
at one point all right so I've got all
all that all housekeeping is done with
those let's get through what color do
you have on the FX 83 currently I don't
know I want to say it's like an ASA tech
unbranded fat radiator 120 or something
it's probably what I have on there so
all right I think what we're gonna try
and do is shut this down and see
if it's gonna be feasible to take apart
on stream and I should have gotten that
no food bowl for this so let's see if we
can actually take this thing apart live
or not hopefully it's all just Phillips
head or other tools that I have
sometimes they use weird tools let's
shut down all the stuff shut down the
pump which is hooked up to a separate
power supply don't mind that and let's
remove the thermometer okay so now we
just need we've got quick disconnects on
this I've turned off power to the
motherboard so if we leak a bit it's
fine and I really like these qdcs let's
hope they continue to work well today so
for these these are the ek ones and I
like them because it's a button push to
remove instead of screwing like the
Alpha cool ones so for this just clip
and it's basically like one drop of
water on either side so I'm just not
gonna put it over the motherboard
obviously but we should be good that's
one half and then for the other half
it's hooked up to the radiator also
about one drop of water down on the
ground
okay so we're free
we've still got water in there it will
leak once I start taking it apart that's
fine I just need to get the fan off
disconnect it from the board and unscrew
the cooler the fans pretty annoying to
get off but not terrible one second and
then we'll get this over on the main
table for teardown so this by the way
this is the fan since you couldn't see
it during the stream peasy cooler
branded fan including their logo and
Chinese characters and it is the S model
so if you want to buy it it's s and is
this just like yeah so there you go
PCB and some oil that's all it is as
expected but not the highest quality fan
it does push a lot of air it's just not
it's not quiet and it's not particularly
long-lasting bearings or any
so what do I need a screwdriver to get
this cooler off and then we can start
taking it apart and I think we'll
probably want to do another tweet or
something and tell everyone that the
surgery is about to commence assuming
that's all using all bits that I have
which I should so yeah peace eco W 120
didn't perform the greatest he saw some
of the results will publish the whole
video as the stream ends as I noted and
now I haven't seen the inside yet so
this is not something I've done I'm
really curious to see if there are any
micro fans in that cold plate at all
assuming we can get in there without a
hacksaw and I think we probably can one
more screw so maybe we should do like a
straw poll or something see what
everyone thinks will be in this thing as
I think I my instincts tell me no micro
fins or basically macro fins I want to
move this light back and we will see if
those instincts are correct so the
cooler is freed this is a yeah if you
didn't see it in the last few I'm happy
to show it to you so yeah there's your
PC cooler W 120 take a good look at that
while I I tweet out the URL and tell
everyone we're about to commence surgery
so surgery commencing on the Aliexpress
water + air hybrid cooler about to tear
it down live check it out here okay
thank you for bearing with me cool okay
so yeah there's our tubes and zip tied
together these are the barbs and
fittings that came with the thin so
they're hooked up right now this was
voted by the community to be what
last time and you can actually see some
of the sort of inlet manifold back here
that was loose lacked last time and
allow me to demonstrate
exactly what's going on in there because
that is where are we doing another vote
for what fast foods to get again you
know we should do that because every
time people do super chats a lot of the
time you know we've had people not quite
sure what to say or ask for a super
check in the rip Ltd stream especially
and a lot of them decided to just tell
us what food to eat with their money
after the stream ended because Roy's
very hungry after these streams end and
typically it's been all kinds of stuff
so if you want to get your vote and I
guess do it go for it so these are the
screws that were loose and this was what
was ultimately part of the problem last
time now part of it was because I didn't
tighten this enough because it just I
mean it wasn't hand tightening and some
of the other fittings I work with do
hand tighten very well but these needed
a wrench so anyway some leaked out
through there and then a lot was leaking
out under this plate just along the
sides because these were loose so I
think what we need to do is just start
taking screws out and see where it leaks
I already obviously know it's gonna leak
up here we'll have to drain this anyway
so I've got my my drain Bowl downstairs
what we can just grab one of these
hopefully that's got enough volume
although I doubt it and I think we'll
just drain it drain it first see what
would happen if you over tied these what
do you mean over tied or tightened over
tighten maybe if so you mean the screws
if I over tighten the screws anything
that happens when you over tighten a
screw you maybe get some thread damaged
or something but if it gets to a point
where it's obvious it's plenty tightened
all right so let's let's just start with
the screws at the bottom cat
don't forgot to clean the throne pissed
off now I'm gonna have to clean it off
the mod matte later that is what the mod
matte is for after all as a hearty
surface okay I'm gonna start with these
screws if I can just because I these are
the ones I have the least suspicion of
in terms of leaking fluid
I think these just hold in the mounting
bracket so there is your mounting
bracket complete with dried distilled
water from leaky and last time and by
the way if you're just joining and got
another hundred people or so who just
joined we just showed some thermal
results for this I'll go over them again
a bit just to recap but we have video
going up separately later that will will
basically be a review of this particular
product and this is kind of stuck in
there so I can get it out if I pull the
hard enough I think but I think we're
just gonna leave it for now and go for
the next set of screws which probably we
should just drain this at this point so
let me where's can you grab the rip I
guess I can get it actually the wire
cutters to get those zip ties off you
should probably be on the tool all at
this point all right so let's cut this
and hopefully we don't don't blow
through this too fast for the volume but
I think we're going to
all right there we go the
water-resistant Mod mat doing its work
once again pretty well I'm glad it's
only gonna get so much drainage out of
this because it's way down there in the
tubes there's some of the cold plate
probably and then hopefully this will
drain enough that I'm not gonna just get
spilled on once I open the thing up and
I will I will plug that mat again
hush toward document access net pretty
resistant to water as you can see here
pretty resistant to heat as you can see
in our previous videos and also a good
thermal paste receptacle that I'm gonna
have to clean later but it does clean
fairly easily with soap and water so God
is fairly drained let's go ahead and
open up these the top screws now the
ones that gave me trouble last time I
think we're gonna get some more leakage
out of here if I have to I can use the
blue print shirt as a rag because why
not although we do have actual shop
towel but that wouldn't be
self-promotion alright so there you go
there's a nightmare now you have an idea
of the screws that are holding this
thing together it's very industrial it's
kind of like the gigabyte GPU coolers
wear or the yeah the video card coolers
where they're just like really and and
when I say industrial I don't mean high
quality I mean it just looks like it was
not designed with any kind of finesse
so they've stuck some very large screws
through here and this holds down that
Inlet manifold which obviously hooks up
to the heat pipe or to the water pipes
that go to the open loop and also to the
pipes below it let go through the cooler
we might have some leakage we'll see
it's probably drained most of it those
aren't even machine screws law that
looks like a wood screw you know yeah it
does look like a wood screw it's got the
pointy tip on it so I don't know if
you're a machinist or you know about
screws and traditional hardware
feel free to grantham chat about the
quality as you
because you're probably gonna see things
that I don't all right so that's been
loosened and can come off there you go
that's the source of a lot of our
leaking originally this is like worse
than I thought okay
so metal screws and have pointy tips -
yeah sure so see some corrosion on this
first of all that yeah sure bye there
wasn't wasn't Matt to be dismissive it
was agreeing with you I say you have
some corrosion on that and basically the
water comes in through one of these
comes out the other of course and we've
got just these kind of cheap rubber
gaskets basically on top of the pipe
which I don't know if that's like a six
that might be a six mil which should not
be particularly large this is a six mil
so this is a six millimeter basically
heat pipe like one of these except it's
been emptied out and you know the
biggest question I have is did they
leave in the normally there is something
in the heat pipes like it's centered or
a weave material or copper like the
centered copper in there something like
that and I think this one probably is
just a straight pipe it's really
blinding light I don't see anything
there so they did actually remove
whatever sintered or weave or whatever
was in there previously or just not put
it in more realistically and and you're
left with that so let's pull these off
and basically I don't know if this this
block up here I don't know if it's got a
partition wall I would certainly hope so
but I don't know if I has a partition
wall in between or not we could probably
fish like something through there let's
just see if I run into a wall I think
there is a wall it as it is partitioned
okay well that's good so his partition
so you're not gonna have like hot and
cold water mixing and going down the
wrong tube so anyway it comes down these
two it's not properly split flow how did
it is split in down two pipes coming
back up to other ones and
take apart the rest of it if we can I
really want to see what's in the cold
blade so that's our next objective here
we've got a lot more people joining
outreach all right all right read my
super chat read my super chat so what
does your super chat say gotta gotta
give me time to go between these things
let's see
Douglas em two dollars do you play any
PC game still not a whole lot I don't
have time with running the site and the
channel I try to whenever I can I played
a couple on the way while I played some
San Juan on my phone on the way back
from Taiwan Vincent Van Region $5 put
wood on roof so this is for that car if
you were here earlier someone asked a
great question of what would be better a
good liquid cooler or a an air cooler on
a car going 70 miles per hour with all
the assumptions that it'll still work
fine is just gonna be on a on a car at
70 miles an hour so Vincent had a
suggestion for that and that was put
wood on the roof strap down the would
put motherboard on the hood using screws
using a 12-volt DC to 110 volt AC
adapter car with Sun roof roof cooler
idea totally get you it would certainly
be interesting it's basically going like
later seasons of Mythbusters extreme
style at that point I don't know I will
think about it one day it would
certainly be interesting have to rent
like actually a kind of nice car for
that although I don't know we just won't
tell them we strap the computer to the
roof I guess not tie a $2.00 doner kebab
thank you not tie up I guess we've got
our first suggestion on what we're
supposed to eat later today and a dracs
whole gaming last one I'm gonna read
before we get back to this and dracs all
said for five bucks I placed my signed g
on tear down crystal on computer I get
20 more PS now in most games is it the
crystal or the signature thanks Tech
Jesus it's the signature it's just the
power that my pens have and if you
actually do have a sign to tear down
crystal you're one of the few because I
think I only sign maybe three of those
before we basically decide
that this is a lot of a lot of work to
sign these things because they're issues
with like trying to get it so doesn't
smear and stuff like that because the
material of the tarragon crystals so
you're one of maybe three or four people
who have that and then we discontinued
the signature model otherwise you can
get the mod mat for the signature at
this point I think that's the only thing
we sell it on it is the mod mats are
offered signed so that's the super chat
so let's look at the next few iswhat is
this I'm going to read this normal chat
first
Augustus said a train leaves Taipei at
3:00 a.m. averaging 50 miles per hour
another train headed in the same
direction leaves Taipei at 4 a.m.
averaging 70 miles per hour at what time
will the second train overtake the first
train I'll let you guys go ahead and
work that out okay so there are four
screws down here we probably see two on
the other Sun the opposing side of where
I am and I'm trying to get them out
without stripping anything but it is
forcing me to go in at an angle so
that's kind of not the best I don't
think this will easily come off I
probably probably like warp it off of
there although it's not really in our
way right now so is there a better way
to dismantle this I guess I could take
like the thin stack off maybe one at a
time if it's not soldered that'd be kind
of a pain in the ass I think it would be
doable although we might hit the heat
pipes notice that is some quality
aluminum right there check that out
okay how stuck down we can we probably
just dismantle this one fin at a time if
it's not gonna take two on and then that
would allow me to make sure I don't
strip those screws hammers are good for
dismantling things weight strapped the
pc to a plane and there will be
bloodletting soon yes this mod man i'm
working on right now has evidence of
bloodletting from previous efforts one
of which was with this cooler alright so
i don't know this is kind of stuck on
the cap of the heat pipe is it the cap
it is the cap i might be able to just
get this off and then the rest should be
easier i think you might be right about
the bloodletting i don't know what it is
with our fans and wanting to see my
blood spilled and streams but you guys
really really seem to want that every
time we do one okay this thing is not
gonna go back together the same way that
came apart although it might it might go
that might be that'll be okay
it's very uh very flimsy aluminum it'll
shape right back into place how much for
a blood-soaked Abad net there you go
there's the counts I was talking about
that's gonna be extra so get some
corrosion in there almost looks like oil
but it is it is I think just corrosion
of some kind might be oil residue maybe
when they manufactured it if they don't
clean it off
actually in our Leon Lee factory tour
you'll see how they have basically a
giant washing machine for case
components to clean the stuff off as it
goes through manufacturing because it
will get oils on it from all the oils
used to lubricate the tools and keep
them cool and clean them so they
actually wash it off and I'm guessing
not all manufacturers do that is this
glued on and is there one for every
plane no there's not one for sure
there's only one of these I think it is
in fact glued into place which is very
annoying nope okay
it was just hardened into place from
dried from tried water that leaked
previously from the the previous attempt
where the top was leaking and also the
hose the G quarter-inch fittings
one at a time on this this is gonna be a
pan I need like a ruler or something
where's your ruler let's see if this
makes it easier if it fits doesn't fit
okay well I might go nah we can get this
off I think I might go the route of just
unscrewing the bottom and hoping that it
doesn't strip because the angle is
really bad basically so you can see the
problem I'm having here I want to take
these off
but at that angle I'm worried that with
others bloodletting worried that I'm not
gonna be able to get the torque I need
yeah oh yeah that's gonna strip so I
think we're gonna have to go down get
access to it properly okay do we have a
thinner like file or something will this
fit that's not gonna be a good tool what
do I have over there that's thin not
much let's see
go with a knife
add some danger to it let's just give
this ruler another shot see if I can
kind of pry it off at the edges there's
some water still in there that I'm
getting contact with right now problem
is it's just it's well first of all if
you were wondering if these were
soldered they are not clearly and
secondly they're just kind of pressure
fitted to the heat pipes so or press fit
I should say not pressure fit press fit
two to the stack and to the heat pipes
and speaking of press fit I was talking
to knock two about their manufacturing
and how we really want to do a tour but
unfortunately I think they don't show a
lot of it because of trade secrets but I
know that that we were just talking
about their press fitting operation for
how they get the fin stacks mounted to
each other this is going to take too
long I think I'm gonna get this one off
and then evaluate the next one if it
looks like it's the same pan and he has
to do we're just gonna try and go with
the screw approach on the bottom flat
head and bend it you know that's not a
bad idea
I need a bigger flathead now let's try
this I guess
okay got one side you got the other side
just we're just gonna commit to bending
these at this point how much we're
paying knots here so someone said don't
cut yourself too late for that but now
all of you freaks you want blood-soaked
mod mats can be happy
alright get off this side come on is it
ice it can be like this all the way down
I think it is what a pain in the ass
that's gonna be although we can't see
the heat pipe quality at this point let
me get this one off and we can look
closer out how the heat pipes look
come on alright just bash the fins out
of the way
yeah couple of heat pipes off yeah we
can do that to you
Oh someone's quoting motherboard the I
bled for this thing that was a great one
can you grab me
let me get yeah it's almost off he
grabbed me the craftsman red and black
screwdriver in the case testing room I
think Patrick was working with it
earlier that will be much easier to work
with
and while Andrews grabbing a better tool
for me just break it yeah this pace cord
doing we could do pliers - on your way
back can you grab the red pliers there -
thanks alright Saran just grabbing tools
alright so heat pipes exposed at the top
you can see see the copper bit there and
then I guess that's just a nickel
plating at the tip of it and he's
grabbing some other tools for me and I
think we'll just bend the crap out of it
at this point just cuz who cares buy
another one if I really want it so throw
on performance by the way on this if you
missed it if you're new here and didn't
catch the first part of the stream it
was not significant so the bronze is
really not great we saw basically
performance equivalent to about a 120
millimeter closed-loop liquid cooler if
you're curious that's kind of what we
were looking at thank you okay that's
throwing it
don't want to take forever taking fins
off so let's see if we can just kind of
break stuff and make it go faster
there we go that's not bad okay cool
much faster very nice yeah so rip w1 20
I suppose if we want to test anymore
we'll have to buy another one at this
point but it has served its purpose and
the full review video will go up after
the stream ends if you do want to see
the performance in a condensed fashion
and not have to go through the stream
DVR or anything like that
this is really that's faster but it's
not better all right let's try just
going out this from an angle one more
time these screws are super tight though
yeah damn okay is there a better way to
get what I want no other than a right
angled Philips head which I
unfortunately don't think I don't think
I have one of a Phillips one or zero
sighs we have a vise it's in a garage
all right drive a bit and crescent
wrench salt and Bend the fins we can do
that too
use a hammer that's it's really how can
I help it can we just cut through these
with this is that gonna be strong enough
that's not bad
I've got better tools I guess I can
start pulling them out from the garage
or something do we we don't have bigger
we have wire cutters or like big cable
cutters over there I don't think so
now you get to see the true disgust
destruction of the PZ cooler w1 20 rip I
think they still have a couple we were
probably one of the only people who ever
bought one of these was sitting on a
shelf for ages hundred bucks from
aliexpress showed for seven years ago
and this is how it ends but the
performance just wasn't that great so
I'm sorry
I might go grab another tool depending
on how this answer this one do you see a
any bigger wire cutter or act like big
cable cutters on that shelf I don't know
if I had any okay please don't let that
Toby close I don't care who cares about
that
gloves bolt cutters and cut the heat
pipes yeah I guess you could do that too
and I don't know if I have any bolt
cutters I really just want to unscrew
the screws but they're gonna strip
because they're in it so these down here
they're not such an angle I don't have a
right angle to Philips head
unfortunately I guess I should buy one
at this point
all right there we go we get some table
wobble and then I'll read super chats
about here's a donation for the wobbly
table fund which I had some ideas on
potentially doing one of those sort of
like automated raising and lowering
tables because I'd really like to get
one of those especially for the set just
because it'd be it'd be so much easier
to do like unique shots and stuff okay
so this is gonna take ages there are a
lot of these I basically need a saw at
this point and if I saw straight down
the middle I guess you'd really just go
through the heat pipes now we can do a
heat pipe this action too which would be
interesting to see if these are centered
or weave or whatever
oh is that turning
that turned
that's actually turning okay might be
able to say it was some time apply
enough force and it will budge yeah okay
cool there's one screw out almost that
place to get the other ones out too so
one
this one is also turning barely got like
one shot there are I'll strip nice okay
I can save us all some time here I
really want to see you know we should do
a straw poll or something if there are
micro fins in this cold plate or not
okay go to apply pressure again okay
this one is also it's raining all right
good news I'm gonna have one more and I
hope it separates the way I think it
will I really do
don't want to take off all the fins one
more and then I might have to loosen
them all one more turn channels no
offense you know yeah let's um let me
start a strawpoll here and wipe the
sweat off let's do a strawpoll one
second and I'll post this in chat
strawpoll will the cold plate have any
micro fins channels channels and fins no
fins touch panels orphans okay okay
create poll share copy URL alright here
you go
here comes a strawpoll take a vote on
that let me know what you think is gonna
be in there and in the meantime because
ambient temperature is pretty high in
here from that thermal test earlier
here's the new GN blueprint shirt on
stored I cameras next to Staton that
doubles as a sweat rag you can't buy
that one let me know what you think I'm
gonna push that straw poll one more time
maybe all that pry and loosen the screws
I don't think ha
I had desperation loosen the screws
come on bastard I just picked the worst
one originally I think that's that most
risk of stripping so that's gonna really
suck
let's get these the rest of the way
starting to separate a bit these screws
in the bottom now oh yeah I didn't show
this earlier check that out there was
this thing is like pitted and bitter
corrosion by pitted and there we okay
really just not a great cold plate so
that's a lot of our thermal performance
limitation right there so not the best
cold plate
hey that screws out I think so get there
we go so here's a look at the screws
that are in there actually also corroded
you can see some brown discoloration on
the threads and a camera might not be
able to focus we'll see can you give it
a shot so there's some discoloration on
the threads give us one second to dial
it in there it is so overall they did
they mix the metals and and that's
apparent by looking at this corrosion
and blood looks good in camera thank you
haha
so yeah mixing metals not even once
I'm curious to see if the if it's cold
if it's corroded inside the cold blade
too
there's the next one is this corroded oh
it's gone the answer was yes this one's
almost out we got one more after this
one and it's gonna be the worst of them
all okay I think we got it
no yes also corroded on that one
everything's corroded so one says I hope
the cameraman is having a great day it
fled with shame yes it certainly did
it's gone okay okay that was a good
house it gets shy hopefully it picked up
on camera when it flew out of the screws
or out of the pliers last damn screw
this one is gonna strip I can feel it
just apply a lot of force please
cooperate it's cooperating okay
so what we're doing now is dismantling
the PC oh that's really stripping it is
coming out though the PC cooler w 120
from aliexpress we did a thermal test on
stream I showed some thermal charts for
performance we have full review that's
going up as the stream ends the
performance his suspect at best and I
suspect that the the poor side of
performance comes down to this cold
plate that we're hopefully gonna get
access to with this screw-up but I'm not
sure if these are holding it all and
that's also crude and no big surprise at
this point so the question is what the
hell were those holding in and was it
actually the accept plate on this okay
screws pretty long yes and it was
definitely holding on to this so what do
I just need to pry it off now and then I
think we can see the inside no micro oh
yeah I should check the the straw pool
let's check the straw pole first before
I pull that off you're gonna have to cut
the pipes yeah I might be correct
especially if they're soldered so let's
see what the results are straw poll
results 412 votes and they say so 39%
think there will be channels 37% think
there will be no channels or fins so
just like an empty hole a block 17% said
no fins and 8% think channels and fins
you guys really don't have high hopes
for this thing and and you really don't
see that don't don't seem to think that
it's gonna be a high quality design I'm
disappointed frankly but you don't think
this cooler that's never made it to
mainstream markets it's gonna be any
good
so am I going to have to cut the pipes I
don't think so because you can see
there's actually a seam between them so
as long as they're not soldered then I
should be okay whether or not they are
soldered is it's going to depend on the
quality micro fen not fens a single fin
someone thanks we'll be in there
macro fin as we've called it in the past
I don't I don't know just this that
looks soldered to me oh yeah I think
that's definitely Dan what I might have
to do to get that a flathead man how
much is this cheap then it's a hundred
bucks believe it or not so where's the
here's the top of it you missed that
part
this basically sits on the top and it is
a so you got in Inlet and outlet here
and it splits between four hoses four
pipes not heat pipes copper pipes I
think and that's it that's all there is
to it goes down and comes back up and
theoretically remove some heat on the
way okay so what are the give me some
real suggestions how are we getting this
off at this point spudger the pipes
themselves go under the plate and the
plate has those four tubes on it so it
won't come apart that is true
suggestions everybody on getting this
last piece off now that we've gotten all
the screws out like real suggestions not
just hammer come on
blowtorch hammer and high flathead
Hammer hammer strong hammer hammer time
use a gun
garbage cam that's probably the best
suggestion I've seen so far
where are the legitimate suggestions
vacuum we don't have the dyson
unfortunately hydraulic press okay
chisel hammer too many too many
suggestions blowtorch we could try that
I guess heat gun we do have heat guns
they're going too fast now heat gun heat
gun heat gun we have it back here I do
have it back here we could try that
take off the mounting hardware you mean
this thing I don't think that's stopping
us from anything at this point unless
they're screws in there that I can't see
which I don't think there are no there
are no more screws in there yeah that's
not in the way at this point oh there we
go well that part was easier than
expected Mountain Hardwear it's gone no
screws and it's weak so I don't know if
they use an adhesive or a solder we
could certainly blast it with a heat gun
we might kind of trip the brake or
depending on how much power we start
using with the heat gun and everything
else soldering iron me with heat gun and
a flat head all right
no he reads only super chats while I
think about if I want to do a heat gun
on this or not okay so sergeant it's $5
mounted a PC on a J 2 cents math mount a
PC on J's two cents car do a video and
get on the hit amount of subs something
tells me he's not gonna want to let us
do that
use the oven don't plug the heat gun in
the same outlet thanks we only have one
circuit in this room
Dennis rigged in $5.00 ratcheting the
offset screwdriver it's basically a
wrench but it fits driver bits oh yeah
you know that sounds like a great idea I
am going to get one of those thank you
for the suggestion I would probably be
able to fit that into that tight space I
was working with earlier okay
Oh someone says they saw a fifth screw
in the middle did you in the middle of
the plates I don't see a fifth screw in
there I don't think there's a fifth
screw in there okay we get back to
reading a few more of these try a small
thin screwdriver pressure between the
wedges all right a couple more to read
or one more to read Leon course off
$2.00 thank you very much
oh my god ponytail tech Jesus sorry Cole
okay have Patrick hold the pin stack and
use a hammer with a punch to knock the
plate out that sounds like something we
should use a vice for instead okay so
we'll give the we'll give the heat gun a
try I'm gonna go through a couple more
through these store orders and that will
get to that store orders Theodore from
California purchased the blue print
shirt Heather a true royal blue print
shirt that's this one that I have right
here which is currently covered in sweat
and uh this is not the one you are
receiving just to be clear and also
another one bought two blue print strips
thank you very much Theodore for the
purchase of the brand-new design think
we're almost out of stock on those
already but we'll order some more
immediately Devon from this is Hawaii
from Hawaii purchased a medium teardown
crystal I've got the top right there
that smaller one is the medium with RGB
vase and the mod mat thank you very much
for the mod mat purchase those are still
still pretty popular and we have another
round coming in within a couple of weeks
so if you get your order in soon for the
mod mat that's stored on Cameron's axis
that it is what we think is the highest
quality mod met in the market right now
so if you're looking for a high quality
build service you can grab that on the
store and then a trowel see I've seen
your name a few times from Iceland to
picked up a blue print shirt and that
brings our stock down quite low on those
thank you all for those purchases okay
all right so let's get back to this
thing and see what cut the heat pipes
and hit the block with a sledgehammer
oh yeah there you go sweat is worth more
DNA clone okay what were the screws okay
what were the screws even doing someone
says use a vise yeah it's so like the
problem every time we get into this kind
of stuff is a lot of that hardware is on
a different floor and we can't really
stream it if we do that it's like I can
if I really want to be proper about it
we'll have to cut and I'll have to go do
it film it separately and bring it back
for a upload reciprocating saw off the
spin stack then get a flat in there I do
think that's probably the smartest
approach is to start cutting through the
pipes or the fin stack and I that is
something I would probably want to do as
an upload as opposed to a stream because
I like I said different floor and we're
not gonna be able to move the whole rig
and everything so that's unfortunate but
there is no other screw in there let's
just do something kind of simple here
and let me just poke at this and see if
that looks like it's going to give
because that'll at least confirm what I
think which is that it's soldered in
which case we'll need some heat I think
okay I'm pretty sure that is solder in
there
yes let's give it let's give a heat gun
a shot I don't know what kind of
temperature will have the pleasure if
will trip a circuit but we can give it a
shot
the very heat gun that we use is handy
in the mod mat testing yeah I don't
think a heat gun will be hot enough
either if it's actually solder but I
don't I don't know I have a torch
I have trammels with many cutting discs
yes we have all that stuff just
different area you heat it to above 250
degrees Celsius it should drop okay all
right
that's just reading it oh yeah this is
gonna be a bit loud sorry I don't know
what I can do about that really if
anywhere I can plug this in yes we can
push more power through that thing
let's see if we trip a circuit breaker
say we've only got one circuit in this
room so I was powering a computer right
now alright it's not a heat gun it's a
hairdryer and before breaker trip it
might happen I'm just reading chat
before it cuts out all right let's see
I'm just like the entire thing's gonna
heat up so don't touch it yeah I'm just
not going to is my solution to that if
you have a drama what we do okay so
here's what we're gonna do
I wanna point the heat gun at it and see
if we get a budge because there's still
a chance it might be like an adhesive
and it just kind of falls apart if it
doesn't budge which i think is the most
likely outcome here so I don't think
this will get hot enough or will trip
the breaker because we're running the
streaming pc it doesn't budge and we
trip the breaker and go down then what
I'll do is publish the review video for
this cooler immediately so check the
channel as soon as the stream goes down
I'm tripping the breaker or as soon as I
conclude and say we're not gonna be able
to open it until I can get in there with
tools in the garage and I think that'll
sum it up so let's see how we do
and yeah I see your messages about
cutting the heat pipes first I do like I
said tools elsewhere for that what is
this and this it only measures in
Fahrenheit so I need to convert
can you get your phone and do a couple
conversions for me Fahrenheit Celsius
thank you
why does everything spike towers still
running is that a good sign
yes but yeah it's a it's not that hot
yet so it's not at scorched resetting
200 degrees Celsius for 82 for ni okay
thank you very much I appreciate that
so we're currently set the 6:40 coming
out of a heat gun let's just see what
this gets for us can you type in 640
Tapan the non-covered part in the bottom
left and it should move towards the
fender area nan cover part in the bottom
left do you mean that this part
toward the fender
yeah takes a second up breaker to get up
and trip you're absolutely correct I
don't think we're there yet there so
we're currently pushing 340 degrees
Celsius at it
good way to go offline streaming with a
zoomin on the heat vibes I mean I think
hopefully we'll be ok here Thanks it's
something they wanted take that back up
there we go all right
so let's give this a moment hopefully
it's doing something we'll find out
sooner if it said he said or anything
just bought a shirt at the gym story
thank you very much
let me is shim it
okay so while this is going I'm gonna
try and like read some of the other
corporate and stuff hopefully I can
point it at it accurately enough got an
order from Austin the name Austin from
Wisconsin and that was the graft logo
shirt thank you very much Austin for
that we certainly appreciate it and do
we have any super chats and it's a read
here's an i-9 more effective than than
be a heat gun yet probably is you only
need to move the cover plate take a
flathead and a torch and fly the cover
plate off yeah that's what we're gonna
try
okay I don't think they're running your
super chasse I'm very very disappointed
at it although I don't blame you
so all we're trying to do is get this
picking hope plate off so I can see
what's under there
it's gonna take in a minute to heat up
and everything I like the jokes here
about how I can pull 500 watts of heat
so have you missed it earlier the back
of the box says this thing can do
500 Watts TDP in reality and the Gunma
at the water plate not the bottom plate
came from the side you mean like over
here so in reality we had like a hundred
and sixty watts getting pulled by it and
it was in the 70s degrees Celsius for
the CPU temperature so I don't believe
that it's gonna do 500 watts I think
that system it's you can use
the boring company is that not a
flamethrower
all right
haha
okay so we're just trying to see if the
solder melts or not gonna give it a bit
more time for this though stunt was like
out of the box almost to me you'd be
surprised
so any
is that too impatient or has there
actually been some movement see if we
catch this nice shirt on fire I don't
think there's been any movement
unfortunately put your wrist on your mat
aim up on ya Oh a little bit of movement
there
it's very hot
hmm-hmm-hmm more heat yeah I think so
okay I need more heat more heat so I
have a sharper edge for this not really
yeah I think we might have to resort to
some better tools which are going to be
used off stream if that's the case
dan
let's just try more heat first let's see
if more heat works she 10 still has a
lower TDP than in tiles 28 core CPU
that's possibly true
see if we trip trip the circuit or not
right blast the water pipes no the heat
pipes why I was going for where the
solder is connected do you think it's
connected somewhere else I guess
where do you think right there
clothes are cheated from the top you
guys mean like this that would make
sense I suppose let's try that
so once where are you we're breaking
things
I know that's not about idea line it on
its side yeah okay so Andrew can you
grab for me the thermocouple reader and
the one thats on that bench right there
and I just
just rearranging stuff guys one second
thank you some a couple reader
what do you bring the black version of
the news tree you know we've had a
couple of people ask if there's that
much interest we can right now we're
just doing the blue cuz the whole idea
was that it's a blue print shirt and I
really wanted a hot black shirt on the
store cuz everything we sell is a black
t-shirt basically other than like the
mod mats and the crystals and stuff so I
if there's a lot of demand for a black
shirt then he'll do a black rose when he
burns his shirt yeah
we are not that hot on this thing over
here what's our temperature here only
like okay there we go
it's right like a hundred and something
right now
yeah needs to be a hotter
Potter harder
well it's time which was like a hundred
hey plans that frequency sound
measurements to new fan reviews yeah
kind of the I really do want to do a
like a noise of frequency spectrum
analysis but
I don't know that we're going to be able
to properly without some external help
I'm figuring out the best way to do it
there we go getting up to like 140 150
now
that's looking pretty good
yeah I don't know this we'll see I don't
know if this law expose the the part I
want to expose but I certainly hope so
right like 140 C on this and it doesn't
look like it's getting any looser so
that might have to be resolved
separately I do see heat like bloom
effect though so you might have to do a
separate video to fully remove this
thing
yeah sorry by your ears
all right I think let's uh let's call it
here and let's see if we made any
progress I don't think we did but either
way you got to see some of the more
important parts which is some of the
performance and some of the the top part
open I just refresh the stream oh yeah
okay cool
daaamn end
I really want it's like wants to move
I'm just pullin at it because I can grab
part of the edge so I think we might cut
this here
thermal shock and cold water great idea
yeah that's not just anyone all right
well anyway let's hold this part and
what we can do for the rest of this is
I'll show you the rest of the thermal
results for anyone who missed it earlier
and we'll also get through publishing
pika a little dangerous to touch right
now publishing the video so let's walk
through what we've learned so far and I
will I'll figure out the rest of this
separately once I can go get access to
my real actual tools downstairs we can
figure that out so here's what we got
this goes on the top up here like that
and this hooks up to four water pipes
that's very hot still hooks up to four
water pipes which had some leakage
issues in our first stream and that's
because these four screws were loose and
if you want to see what the new screws
look like they're these huge ones right
here so those go in through here and
those hook into the top of the thin
stack and that's that's shipped too
loose so these fittings are stock with
it they came with it we use them as you
all voted in the previous stream and
then we had our open-loop setup on the
bench so we did a 360 radiator and one
without a radiator and that was all the
testing so let's let's look again at
some of the test data here and go
through some of that just to show you
how it performs if you're curious
because it's not it's not impressive
where is it here it is okay so let's get
a shot of these charts one more time so
if you missed it and I think somebody
did a couple of hundred new viewers here
these are are the results for the PC
cooler w 120 which we've partially
disassembled I got stuck at the part I
really want to see but I'll figure it
out Oh
figure it out with with some extra
effort later and we'll show you all what
it looks like so these are the results
at 40 decibels noise normalized and that
allows us to see kind of the efficiency
of each cooler at a fixed noise level so
they can't cheat just by having faster
fans pzw 120 no radiator 58 degrees as
opposed to the EVGA CLC 120 at 1700 rpm
so 40 DBA which is like 48 49 degrees so
a CLC 120 10 degrees advantaged that's
not even if that's like a 60 $70 part
and this PC cooler w 120 is like a
hundred bucks before you factor in the
pump and rez combo so what then if we
add a 360 rad to it we get up to with
our standardized space forty four point
eight degrees which is a bit worse than
outside of error the X 42 at 40 DBA not
impressive a proper 360 grad up here the
MLC Phoenix at 40 DBA 35 degrees just to
give you some perspective so not the
best color we've looked at noise levels
I think we have them on here yes this is
a bit small but stock fan it was forty
eight point five DBA when maxed out at
one hundred percent which puts it right
around the Phoenix at 2150 rpm with
three fans bar at our fans here the
isolated test will skip past these and
go instead to the full tests so this
gives you an idea and again I'll publish
this video in about a couple minutes
here this gives you an idea how it
compares the rest of the stack so we did
some of these test live they validated
actually about the same as all these
numbers and PC cooler w 120 this is the
one we tested today on the stream for
that first hour so we ran some tests on
it and it had no radiator with the stock
pace that it comes with this stuff right
here it comes out to 57 degrees which is
steel C 120 with a fan that 15 higher
rpm lower than its max not impressive
the PC cooler w 120 360 radiator
standardized paste
forty-one degrees for the 360 and that
is comparable to the coarser h100 iv2 at
1500 rpm which is 41 degrees so again
really not an impressive cooler but a
lot of fun to work with water
temperature is a bit of a problem the
orange line is the original paste no
radiator and it just kind of kept
climbing blue line and test obviously
cut off here but the blue line is the
stock setup no radiator just straight to
a pump and res with standardized paste
still on the 30s high 30s for that red
line is with the radiator so you can
really see the effect of a radiator with
some extra fans because it just wasn't
getting rid of that heat for the in the
liquid so that's what we have for the
charts and I'm going to go ahead and get
that video published like now so we can
start pushing people over there if you
have purchased anything in the last 30
minutes or so let me or submitted super
chat or anything let me read off your
orders thank you again for supporting us
so we got an order from Jeremy from the
UK for a mod Matt thank you very much
Jeremy
we'll have those in very soon so the the
orders will be going out shortly
probably couple weeks for the next round
of mod Matt Carlos from Florida
purchased a Raglan hoodie Thank You
Carlos for that we really like those
hoodies are great for cool weather or
early summer weather basically that the
the best end for its use and then we got
a couple super chats as well I think so
we got a Douglas M $5 heat gun still has
lower TDP than Intel's 28 core CPU $2
from Ace of Spades it's the only way a
chick-fil-a launch thank you very much
commands o says will you bring a black
version of the new shirt think we answer
that if I keep using it to interact with
this then yes if there's interest they
will do it and let's see now is the
hammer part Steve Vincent says hold down
heat pipes and pull from water pipes
that's probably good idea yeah so what
we're going to do for the rest of this
is
get tools from not in this room and take
apart the rest and show you so what I do
now is publish that video if you are on
YouTube which you are watching this head
over to the channel I've just published
the authentication expired thank you
very much YouTube
I appreciate the assistance I'm going to
be publishing this review right now and
I'll post a link in chat will publish
the article momentarily after it if you
prefer in text format and that's going
to have all the results from today's
testing and from from the testing I did
beforehand so let's see if that
publishes yes it did publish all right
go check it out brand new video and let
us know what you think of that that ku
those cooler results 20 bucks from
Daniel killing thank you very much keep
up the good work lads thank you
alright so there's a link to the new
video go check it out that's the review
of this thing we'll have to take it
apart separately get into that cold
plate and see what's really in there
sorry we couldn't do it today but I did
my best with the tools we had here the
interesting thing we did get to learn
this is no longer scorching hot is that
all the screws are corroded it's like
every single screw in this thing that we
took out is corroded and that's because
they mix the metals and they were
touching water parts with water this has
some corrosion on it cold plate has
corrosion on it everything has corrosion
on it water comes in this pipe goes down
the the four water pipes and then you've
got heat pipes the root for the rest so
it's interesting I liked working on it
but it is not something we recommend
buying check out the review melt the
solder it will fall apart yeah well
we'll do it I'm just going to do that
with proper tools in the garage and
we'll get back to you on it so there you
go there's the link to the video check
it out compare the temperatures now that
it's all destroyed yeah
I think this is no longer valid for
testing okay guys as always you can go
to store it on cameras Nexus dotnet to
pick up some of our products helps out
directly our brand new blueprint design
shirt is up there and assuming this one
hasn't become scorched held up so there
you go thermally tested against the W
120 and also a sweat rag for the stream
so that's the new blueprint shirt you
pick it up on store like a mis-text it's
not net probably low on stock so if
we're out of those check out the graph
logo shirts or our mod mats and our
crystals that we've had here in the
background as always oh yeah so on oh
yeah it's got the ad in it for the shirt
right so once a three-d turning shirt oh
my god like thank you I'm glad you like
the 3d shirt and the ad alright thanks
for watching go to a patreon.com/scishow
and axis or just the channel and check
out this review it's live now and we're
gonna close out the stream figure out
the rest later
in terms of dismantling it and I hope
you had some fun with it yeah I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
