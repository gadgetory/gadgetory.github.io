of combi tax 2018 we have a quick news
roundup for you of major items coming
out of the show some of them more
relevant than others the biggest one
that we won't be talking about today is
going to be AMD canceling their z4 90
chipset that's been rumored for a while
now so if it vanishes and you don't know
why it's not because the rumors were
false because anthe killed it we'll be
talking about why that happened today
and then a couple of news items from
Nvidia and their press briefing which
mainly boils down to being pointless
they came in front and then also we have
a couple of things from Intel for the
8086 and the 28 core CPU before that
this video is brought to you by EVGA and
the X 299 dark motherboard for the Intel
high-end desktop CPUs the X 299 dark is
one of the only motherboards on the
market with proper vrm cooling we've
tested this and found a significant
performance increase over those without
active cooling on the BRMS this board
was used in our recent attempt to set a
top 10 record in fire strike and you can
learn more about the x-29 dark at the
link in the description below for the
first news item for the AMD Z 490
chipset so this chipset was meant to
basically follow up x4 70 it's the
complete exact same chipset as x4 70
except Andy was planning to add plx
chips for packs chips which are PCIe
multiplexers so basically AMD wanted to
get functionally more lanes assignable
to PCIe devices on z4 90 from x4 70 by
using plx chips apparently and he had
trouble sourcing enough plx chips or
enough at a reasonable price anyway and
so what happened is they ended up just
completely canceling the platform within
a day is actually this is less than 25
actually at the time this video goes up
less than 48 hours ago the cancellation
of the z4 90 platforms that is dead
we've confirmed it with multiple sources
who work on motherboards in the
industries that that's for sure
confirmed gone and other than that
information on Nvidia so some people
were a bit surprised I guess for some
reason that there were no new video
cards at this event and video doesn't
typically launch cards here
and we've been saying for a few months
now that GD dr6 production lines up more
with an August timeline for the new card
so pretty nebulous right now it's kind
of end of July potentially August
looking like maybe Gamescom for launch
but either way certainly not anytime in
the immediate future for the next
generation of nvidia gpus GD r 6 is in
mass production from all the vendors at
this point so they have the supply not
sure what the delay is something
internal I guess but that's it's the
timelines August basically is what we're
looking at which also is about the
timeline for thread refer to next news
item is Intel and their 28 core h EDT
cpu so this one was showcased at
Computex on stage it's functionally
Intel's pre-emptive response to the 24
core thread river CPU that's coming out
at the show probably or at least should
be if not then it will be announced soon
and so the 24 core threader for CPU is
going to be on the tr4 platform just
like the existing ones it's gonna be on
x3 99 Intel's 28 core CPU however we're
not clear if it's the same LGA 20 66 or
not it does pull a lot more power so it
might be a different different socket
type for that one but the 28 core CPU
was overclocked to 5 gigahertz on stage
it can do two might seven gigahertz
stock we have no idea what the boos
clock will be that's the one that really
is the big question mark and scored 73
34 and Cinebench if you compare those
numbers for a 5 gigahertz overclocked
700 millimeters squared and they call it
an xcc CPU rather than an HCC CPU so
rather than high core count it's extreme
core count apparently at least they
didn't call it extreme mega task you
know like they've done in the past and
then also their 8086 CPU so the 8086 k
CB is justin anniversary edition cpu
there's nothing special about it at all
other than it's basically a bin 280 700
K that is pre clocked to basically 5
gigahertz so that's all you need to know
about that other than the rumors were
incorrect it's not soldered sorry it's
actually Tim so that's disappointing on
the 8086 k not really sure what value it
provides it's more expensive
it's Bend it clocks to about the same
place that they do 700 K should and it
uses Tim so nothing particularly
exciting there and finally courser had
RGB RAM so we'll end it there nothing
nothing really worth talking about
beyond that they put RGB LEDs on memory
modules and they do 3200 megahertz so
that's it for coarse hairs high
computation as always subscribe for more
go to patreon.com/scishow next it stops
out directly gonna store it on camera
nexus dotnet to pick up one of our mod
mats and we'll have a lot more show
coverage coming up soon including more
news coverage and mini round it was like
this one so make sure you subscribe I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
