hardcore overclocking and today we're
gonna be doing an m4 motherboard
highlights kind of thing so basically
I've built a list of a m4 motherboards
that I think are good I've pulled the
prices for them from Newegg there are
obviously there's sales going on right
now so the prices aren't like if you see
this video and like you know maybe a
week some prices may not be very
accurate anymore but uh yeah basically
here's a list of motherboards that I
think are good in some way shape or form
so if you're looking for an a m4
motherboard these are motherboards I
think you should consider and we're
gonna start at the high end and then
we're gonna work our way down with some
you know subcategories along the way as
well before that this video is brought
to you by us and the just buy it code
unlike real time ray-tracing our merch
actually exists to commemorate the most
memorable quote of the year and also
Black Friday but mostly the first thing
everything on the GN store is 10% off
with a discount code just buy it at
checkout that includes our most popular
item the critically acclaimed GN mod
mats our shirts ceramic coffee mugs and
GPU component posters and everything
else as a bonus this is also a great way
to support jion's work the code last
through November 26th go to store doc
gamers access net or click the link
below so in the top end if you like
tweaking things if you like be CLK
overclocking if you want to mess with
precision boost overdrive and if you
want to buy a 2700 X I'm gonna point you
towards the X 470 horas gaming 7 Wi-Fi
and the reasoning for this is very
simple gigabytes implementation of BC LK
overclocking technically violates AMD
specifications for how BC LK
overclocking is supposed to work
but since AMD specifications are in my
opinion completely bloody stupid similar
to how AMD broke HBM overclocking on
fury cards which again that's AMD spec I
still think AMD spec is dumb the thing
is that ultimately be CLK overclocking
on gigabyte motherboards works better
than on every other motherboard I've
tested so far and the reasoning is very
simple you change the BC LK and the CPU
acts like the BC LK hasn't changed so
you get a junk bump in performance but
you don't run into
any issues whereas on like ASUS
motherboards and asrock motherboards and
msi motherboards if you bump up the BC
LK the CPU will immediately go into will
just get locked at base clock and bow
and I think asus has workarounds to get
around that but those workarounds are
way way WAY clunkier than gigabytes
implementation of just not doing any
like it just doesn't do it you just
raise the BC okay and the motherboard
acts like nothing changed which is much
much more convenient as far as I'm
concerned now it is worth noting that
this feature is super neat as far as I'm
concerned because basically if you're
gonna be overclocking with the BC okay
you need to keep in mind that it can
cause m2 SSD corruptions it can cause
incompatibility with GPUs and all kinds
of other issues because when you're
overclocking with the BC LK everything
gets overclocked and the benefits to it
are is you're gonna get slightly more
single-core boost and slightly more
multi-core boost as well because the
whole idea behind BC LK overclocking is
that you basically take like the the way
I do a be CLK overclock for a 2700 X 4x
or 70 or s gaming seven is basically I'd
go into the BIOS I'd go into the
precision boost overdrive settings I'd
max out all of the current and power
limits then I would raise the BC okay
and then tweak the core voltage offset
up or down until I get stability the
thing is at best after you do all of
this and initially this sounds really
simple after you do all of this at best
you're probably gonna get about 5% more
performance because that's roughly the
clock speed increase you get from
raising the bcl-2 on V cell K to 105
megahertz instead of the stock 100
megahertz right and it's really not like
you're gonna hit a hundred and ten
megahertz especially considering that
the pcie 3.0 breaks completely at around
one hundred and seven so do keep that in
mind like there's the the performance
gains are very very limited and it
causes all kinds of stability issues as
I mentioned the M del 2 SSDs and
you know some GPUs not playing well with
it but the other issue it tends to cause
is that you need to stress test your
CPUs stability on single core dual core
quad core six
core and eight core workloads because
you're essentially changing the boost
speed for all all of these different
configurations at the same time and you
need to revalidate that in all of these
workloads it's still stable because you
can run into situations where okay
you're all core boost is completely
stable but at four core workloads you're
getting you know you're getting let's
say 4.25 gigahertz and the voltage is
too low to actually sustain that 4.25
gigahertz clock speed and the CPU
crashes I had a CPU that behaved like
that which is why I'm pointing this out
so ultimately while you know BC LK
overclocking with precision boost
overdrive can help you eke out every
last percentage point of performance out
of your CPU at the same time it's really
tedious and ultimately what you're gonna
like the primary concerns with PBO I
think are just having negative voltage
offset because at least that's not
nearly as difficult to fine-tune
basically if you run like a minus 100 or
a minus 50 millivolt offset you get a
bit more boost because the CPU isn't so
thermally constrained and it's not such
a big role tidge drop that it actually
causes any issues once you start playing
with the BC okay you may find that you
need even the stock voltages that the
PBO applies which are insanely high mind
you you might actually need those
voltages to just run stable at all and
overall it's just like messing with the
bc okay in my opinion not really worth
it but if you are gonna mess with it
this motherboard does it the best at the
same time you know you get a really good
vrm heatsink and it really solid ten
phase V core V curve erm using 40 amp
hour stages from international rectifier
and just really this this is a solid
motherboard if you want to mess with
that kind of thing so that's why it gets
much you know gets on to the high-end
portion of my list of motherboards worth
considering now then oh and it also
costs two hundred and thirty dollars now
then moving on to the other high-end
candidates we have the x4 70 taichi
ultimate this does not have the great BC
lko great AMD spec violating BC LK
overclocking implementation that the
gigabyte motherboard has
now this has the main reason this call
here is because it has at quanti a 10
gig LAN which I think you know if you
want a 10 gig network controller this is
the only board you can get so that is
you know that's that's pretty neat you
get a much you actually get a better V
curve erm so you got a 12 phase but the
heat sinks are not so great
however it is worth noticing that the
vrm here is so freakin overkill that you
don't actually really need a heatsink in
the first place anyway so the fact that
the heatsink is more work of art than an
actual heatsink doesn't actually
negative negatively affect the vrm in
any way shape or form the board does
have working net negative core voltage
offsets and it does have working
precision boost overdrive so you can
still you know achieve the same kind of
like you can achieve all of the same
performance as you would with gaming 7
if you just didn't bother with the BC LK
overclock which again if you're planning
to run em dull to SSDs I would strongly
recommend that you just don't mess with
the BC LK because I haven't heard at
least one horror story of an end to SSD
just getting completely braked
afterwards so yeah and overall at the
same time it causes issues like them
Dell - SSDs just not getting detected a
lot of the time so if you don't want to
mess with BC ok overclocking and you
just want a you know one to just run
precision boost overdrive and then a
negative voltage offset this is gonna be
a really good choice for that because it
does do all of those things and you get
the the 10 gig LAN
of course the Gigabyte motherboard does
it - and in this case this board is 255
dot 255 it of money if you go with the
gaming 7 here now then this motherboard
doesn't actually make it onto the list
of motherboards I think you should
consider but I will give it an honorable
mention and the reason why it's getting
an honorable mention is because I have
one of these I like it a lot as an
extreme overclocking motherboard I think
on liquid nitrogen this motherboard is
absolutely amazing it has a great like
the vcore vrm on this thing is the best
week or vrm you can get on x4 70 it's a
10 phase because at the time aces still
knew what a doubler was you know you
have a 10 phase 60 amp hour stages
absolutely amazing the RM and it doesn't
really do anything other than that like
the problem is you know on ambient
cooling it basically like it over clocks
basically the same as the Tai Chi or the
gaming seven so I don't really see a
good like that's why it you know it's
getting an honorable mention because
this thing is two hundred and fifty five
dollars and I don't think most people
buying this thing will actually run it
on liquid nitrogen and if you're not
gonna run it on liquid nitrogen this is
kind of like buying a rally car to go
shopping in it technically you can fit
shopping you can technically fit
shopping bags in a rally car but there's
no AC you know it's really expensive
there's not really it's not very
comfortable and just overall it there's
no real reason I would get this
motherboard for a daily system right
like this does everything that this does
literally everything you could want on
ambient cooling that this does and this
does more than what this does and this
is even cheaper like two hundred and
thirty dollars so you know great extreme
overclocking motherboard but just I
don't think it's worth it for for a
daily system it just doesn't make sense
like I wouldn't put this in a daily
system it's just really really expensive
and it doesn't do anything that makes
much of a difference in a daily scenario
so yeah that's why it gets the honorable
mention but I wouldn't actually buy this
motherboard for like a daily build just
unfortunately just doesn't do anything
that all that special and it costs a lot
so then now we get into the hundred and
eighty dollar price category with a
whole bunch of motherboards at one
hundred and eighty dollars now there's
the X 470 Taichi which you know how I
like this month this vrm great VRM yeah
you get that same great vrm you don't
get the 10 gig lan unfortunately they've
also decided to remove the two like the
power and the reset button you do still
have the postcode which is actually kind
of a killer feature at this price point
because this has troubleshooting LEDs
and this has like this has four LEDs for
troubleshooting this also has four LEDs
for troubleshooting this has a post code
if there's something wrong this is much
easier to understand then you know
four LEDs telling you roughly that oh
there's something wrong with the RAM
there's something wrong with the GPU
there's something wrong with the CPU
well this gives you much more detail
because it has the postcode so much much
more useful also has a better vrm than
the other two motherboards in this price
category that are worth considering and
it still has you know it has the
negative voltage offset it has precision
boost overdrive overclocking support
you're gonna stick a 2700 X into a
hundred and eighty dollar motherboard as
of right now this is probably the best
choice mostly because this is on a
pretty deep discount right now at least
at the time that I was writing up the
script so yeah for $180 I really like
this like this is a really solid choice
of a motherboard right especially
considering the competition it has now
then the next motherboard in this
category
the ROG Strix x4 70 - eff gaming so this
has a six plus four phase VR I'm using
60 amp power stages so pretty
significantly weaker than what you get
on this motherboard however at the same
time more than enough to run a 2700 X
it's still not gonna overheat or
anything like that especially because
this has some reasonably substantial
heat sinks like they're not great heat
sinks but they're still a lot better
than what a Sesana lot of their other
motherboards which isn't really saying a
whole lot because Asus tends to put
terrible heat sinks on most of their
boards but this is a lot better than
like a lot of the other boards they make
and so you do have negative voltage
offset you have precision boost
overdrive overclocking working it does
technically rbcl K as all the same
issues the crosshair seven hero has like
you know if you're gonna put a 2700 X in
something this is also a solid option
but it's just like yeah I would I don't
see a reason to pick this up over a
Taichi as long as the Taichi is at the
same price point as this is well
actually the Taichi is currently cheaper
as this is a hundred and eighty five
dollars but nonetheless very solid
motherboard and honestly kind of
interchangeable in my eyes with the
Taichi like you know pick your poison
taichi's vrm is technically better I
don't think you're actually gonna notice
a difference Taichi does also have the
postcode I actually like the post go to
law I would probably go for the postcode
here but uh yeah either of these boards
you know they're they're pretty
interchangeable as far as I'm concerned
both
have a like well this has a good vrm
this has a better vrm but both are good
enough for a you know anything you'd
really want to do and BIOS wise they
don't really different features all that
much either now this gets an honorable
mention this doesn't really deserve to
be considered that much because this
doesn't have negative core voltage
offset so you can't actually like for
the problem one of the core issues with
precision boost overdrive is that AMD's
precision boost overdrive likes to use
way more voltage than is necessary like
if you max out precision boost overdrive
at four point three five gigahertz
you're likely to see voltages of like
1.5 volts which doesn't actually help
anything because normally the CPU hits
four point three five gigahertz anyway
and it does it with about 50 millivolts
less or even 100 millivolts less in some
cases so you know with with like the
ASUS motherboards the asrock
motherboards and the gigabyte
motherboards when you max out precision
boost overdrive the first thing you do
is you also set like a negative 50
millivolt or negative 100 millivolt core
voltage offset MSI doesn't have this
functionality in their BIOS at all so
while this motherboard has a plenty
solid 5 phase VRM in fact I was really
impressed by this 5 phase VR I'm at in
my testing if you're gonna buy a 2700 X
or a 2600 X this motherboards gonna
actually limit you on overclocking with
precision boost overdrive now if you
just want to set up a static all core
overclock this thing is great and quite
frankly interchangeable with the other
two boards in this price category so if
you're unlike arisin 7 2700 you know
it's basically choose a feature like
that you you're basically going to be
choosing one of these three motherboards
on a feature you like or the way it
looks or like the postcode right like
that there's their overclocking wise
these three boards pretty much
interchangeable so you're gonna have to
find something while static overclocking
obviously if you're doing precision
boost overdrive this isn't going to work
as well as the other two but if you're
gonna run a 2700 considering how cheap
the 27 hundreds are currently might be a
you know probably a better choice than
2700 X these are interchangeable for
static overclocking these
really interchangeable as far as I'm
concerned so yeah that's the 180 dollar
price price point now let's go to 140
dollars now here we have the X for 70
horas ultra gaming this is a motherboard
I would straight-up not put anywhere
near a 2700 X because let's say you have
a room to like let's say you live
somewhere where the summer hits say 35
degrees Celsius or even 30 this vrm is
gonna overheat guaranteed it's gonna
overheat if you're actually pushing a
2700 X on this board also the vrm is
just really not that great and I'm
pretty sure when I was testing with this
motherboard it was actually limiting how
much precision boost overclocking I was
able to do with it so with the 2700 like
the 2700 X is just too power hungry for
the VR I'm on this board because this is
just like it looks really like it looks
like an 8 + 3 phase and gigabyte is
still marketing it as an 8 + 3 phase
it's a 4 + 3 though I'm pretty sure I
made a pretty long video about how they
need to stop well whatever it's a 4 + 3
phase I guess they changed the other
boards just didn't bother with this one
then it's interesting what's to miss
that anyway it's a 4 + 3 phase VR I'm
it's really not a good fit for a 2700 X
if you want to max out like but if you
want to mess with B CLK overclocking on
a 2600 X this is a really good option
because this is the cheapest board from
gigabyte with B CLK overclocking so yeah
that's that's like the one scenario
where this motherboard makes some amount
of sense but it's again it's not really
practical you know it's a hundred and
forty dollar motherboard for a six core
xx set like the the 2600 X is just not
exactly a good value CPU and then this
motherboards kind of expensive so that
even further lessens the overall value
you'd be getting out of your build so
yeah I just like this is an interesting
motherboard to mess with it's not
actually a very good but as far as being
a good mother board goes it's not a good
motherboard just has some interesting
features that might be worth considering
if you have some niche
requirements but so that's why I'm
considering this like an honorable
mention again because yeah like I
wouldn't put an eight-core on it and
it's too expensive for a 6-quart really
so then what would I put an eight-core
in well there's this thing this is
borderline K both like this is
borderline able to run a 2700 X at you
know one point four volts or all core
and so if you wanted to do a static
2,700 overclock this is great but the
issue is MSI makes a whole bunch of B
450 boards that have this exact same vrm
or a very similar vrm and more
substantial heat sinks so unless you
desperately need the X 470 chipset for
some reason I'm not sure what that
reason may be but there might be some
feature on this motherboard you want the
vrm on this is solid enough but the
thing is you can get this same VRM at
the same price point this boards one
hundred and forty dollars you can get
this board for one hundred and forty
dollars you get the same four plus two
phase vrm it looks like an eight phase--
it's a four plus two phase they've fake
like they're putting a whole bunch of
components in parallel so this 4 + 2
phase and this 4 + souffles are exactly
the same this one has a bigger heat sink
where this is a be 450 board I think
this board also comes with like Wi-Fi in
things so there's like this is a better
featured board but it's be 450 whereas
this is an X 470 motherboard and it's a
bit more barren but the vrm between them
is the same and this one has better VR
I'm cooling so this is kind of a case
like if you can't think of a reason why
you need the X 470 chipset get this for
your 2700 like this is gonna work
perfectly well as well now what if we
want to or what if you want to go even
cheaper on your motherboard well this
works if you still have a substantial
heatsink the v RM got a little bit
downgraded at this point but it's still
roughly the same the RMS here the heat
sinks just a bit smaller so ultimately
this will still probably have better vrm
thermals than the x4 70 gaming plus just
because the heatsink is so much more
substantial here and that's also why
this this has gotten on the list but all
keep in mind all the MSI motherboards
lack and negative core voltage offsets
so
if you're gonna be so you know your best
gonna be certain maxy now to 27 like
overclocking in 2700 I think for maxing
out of 2700 you'd probably want this
board just because the extra phases
might actually help with your
overclocking range and you know or this
or that but uh and I'm not talking power
K power delivery capability I mean the
output power like the output voltage
ripple of this five phase or this six
phase or this twelve phase is just gonna
be up quite a bit lower than what you
get on these four phase designs but
nonetheless this is like one of the best
for phase V RMS on the entire X 470 like
on the entire m4 platform so this is a
solid v RM and you should get a good
overclock out of a 2700 you can still
precision boost over precision boost
over dry overdrive overclock your 2700 X
as well you're just not gonna you know
you're just not gonna be able to
minimize the voltages that it runs at
and that's kind of true for all of the
MSI motherboards so yeah as well as this
one but for a 2700 or a 2600 this is
like a great fit in fact for a 2600 that
vrm is probably kind of like that the RM
is cooling is kind of overkill the four
phase i'd say is kind of a requirement
for even a six core now what if you want
to nem ATX motherboard well
unfortunately it's yet more MSI and
here's the thing MSI currently has like
they're running the worst MOSFET they
have on the beef like out of the
motherboards I've gone through so far
the B 450 mm mortar here has the worst
mosfet out of the msi boards this uses a
three million RDS on MOSFETs
for comparison gigabyte typically like
their low side masa is typically four
milliohms RDS on which translates to
roughly 33% more heat from the low side
MOSFETs on gigabyte in gigabytes vrm so
MSI just absolutely sweeps the
competition when it comes to erm
component quality and then they also
have these massive heat sinks on all of
them which is why we're you know if
you're gonna go em ATX I'm gonna point
you to the mortar if you're gonna be
running like a 2,700 2,600 2,600 X or
even 2,700 X
right because ultimately there's not
really an M ATX motherboard from anybody
where it's like yeah sure they have the
negative voltage offset but those
motherboards have erm so bad that even
within minus 100 millivolts offset on
the CPU that vrm is likely to overheat
if you run a long multi-core workload
and I've tested that I've actually had a
board do that already in my testing so
yeah basically if you're gonna be going
m ATX this is the only motherboard i
would recommend for running at an 8 core
or a 6 core really so that's that what
if you want tonight and this thing comes
in at just $80 so you know this is also
pretty cheap so that's kind of neat yeah
MSI is just like basically MSI is unlike
all of these MSI boards are on this list
because MSI has just used better MOSFETs
than everybody else and then then they
figured out hey if we just use a bigger
slab of aluminum than everybody else our
vrm is gonna run cool because it's gonna
run even cooler because again MSI BRM is
it tad more efficient than everybody
else's right now so yeah that's why all
of these MSI boards got onto the list
now in Mini ITX land MSI has the B 450 I
gaming plus AC and the reason why I'm
putting it on the list is because this
vrm right here is actually really solid
this is a six phase using 60 amp power
stages so you basically get the same vrm
that you would get on the Strix right
here of course the heatsink on this
thing is much smaller
it's an ITX board but if you're gonna be
you know running an 8 core in an ITX
setup your VR M is just gonna kind of
like your VR M is just gonna suffer
that's that's just what what its gonna
because there's not a lot of space to
put a heat sink or a very large v RM or
even to spread the v RM over a large you
know segment of PC because you can just
lower the thermal density doing that a
bit well you can't do any of that and so
for that reason the B 450 I gaming plus
IC from MSI is my pick for best ITX
motherboard and you know it and the cool
thing is it also only comes in at around
120 dollars you also get two
60 amp hour stages for your SOC vrm
however I would not actually recommend
this motherboard for running ap use msi
APU overclocking support in their BIOS
is just kind of terrible so yeah but
that's just like basically the the the
best way to summarize the MSI am for
motherboard lineup is to say most of
them are really great in the vrm
department right like the this
absolutely is the best vrm on ITX you
can get at this price point there isn't
a motherboard with a better vrn similar
for this one and this one at these price
points these just hands-down have the
best VRMs but MSI's BIOS is kind of
lacking when it comes to things like
offset voltage VC LK APU overclocking
support is just not great and so for
that reason if you're gonna be looking
at AP use I'm gonna point you towards
this if you're gonna do an ITX apu build
i'm gonna point you towards this and the
reason why is simple you get a 4 + 2
phase of ER i'm using 50 amp power
stages from international rectifier and
unlike on MSI's motherboard gigabytes
relative kind of clunky but you know
once you learn the gigabyte bios it's
pretty quick to get around gigabytes
bios actually has all of the features
they're just a bit difficult to find and
all of the features also work it so yeah
if you're gonna be overclocking an APU
like a 2400 G or a 2200 G this is gonna
serve you great and you know the weaker
VRM being a 4 + 2 phase here isn't real
concern because the AP us really don't
pull that much like they're they're just
oh quad core right with hyper-threading
at most they really don't pull that much
of e core power and the a GPU does
actually pull a significant pretty
significant amount of power once you
start overclocking the memory and just
overclocking everything really
but ultimately the the - fais the the 2
phases for SOC power on this motherboard
are still going to be able to handle
that just fine so that's why you know if
you're going to be doing an APU ITX
build this would be my motherboard of
choice for that just because this has
the best balance of like features and we
are like vile
couldn't you know by Oh support and VR
I'm components right there so then what
if you want a ATX or M ATX APU build
well I'm gonna point you towards Asus
because again like well I'm gonna point
you towards this and the reason I'm
gonna point you towards this board is it
has an SOC vrm heatsink now don't be
fooled this may look like it's a 10/10
fait plus two-phase vrm it's still a
four phase it's the same four phase asus
has on all of their motherboards all of
their other cheap motherboards but at
the very least they've upgraded the vrm
heat sinks and again the apos really
don't pull that much power so you're not
gonna need to worry about the like the
main concern there is just getting the
vrm heat sinks an asus has great apu
overclocking support like i like there's
basically i have an asus motherboard
here that i'm only really holding on to
because it's so good at APU overclocking
compared to all the other boards so yeah
the reason why I wouldn't recommend an
Asus ITX motherboard for APU
overclocking is because they have a
single-phase SOC vrm which is just not
enough as far as I'm concerned like you
should have at least two phases for the
SOC which Asus doesn't have on their ITX
board but on their M ATX and their ATX
boards the tough B 450 Pro Series this
is like a new lineup of tough boards
that they're doing they've upgraded the
VR I'm cooling the VR I'm under the heat
sinks is it still the same but the APU
support is great so and unfortunately
these motherboards are for pre-order
currently only and I think this M ATX
one might be somewhere around $90 I'm
not sure about the full ATX one I'm
gonna guess it's also gonna be about $90
so yeah that is all of the a m4
motherboards and which bit like that's
all of the a m4 motherboards I consider
worth considering most motherboards that
I didn't address here I just think her
straight-up terrible in some way shape
or form it's anything from just vrm is
awful which is true for quite a few of
the asrock ones as well as the Asus ones
and the gigabyte ones really everything
that is in
as I they're terrible a lot of the those
are just awful
but uh yeah a spent like at the lower
price points it's just like that's kind
of the case across the board but or and
in some cases you know it's a case of
like oh the BIOS is missing certain
features or or memory overclocking just
doesn't work very well but uh here but
the board's I've just gone through these
are all boards I consider like oh like
that I feel like some all of these have
a niche that they're actually good at
there's a lot of other boys out there
where it's just like why would you like
why would you even get it so yeah that
is the you know
highlights list of a.m. for motherboards
