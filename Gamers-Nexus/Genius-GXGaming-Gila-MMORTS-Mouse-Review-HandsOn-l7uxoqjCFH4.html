next to start night and today we're
looking at geniuses new hila GX gaming
mouse you can check out the full review
on the website linked below but this
video is just to serve as a quick
overview and give you a better visual of
the product let's cover specs before we
get into opinions the the Gila mouse is
equipped with 12 total buttons there are
two in the traditional Mouse for mouse 5
positions near the thumb grip 2 on a
crested Ridge near the left mouse button
so it's kind of raised its a little bit
elevated and then 2 on the opposite side
near the right mouse button in the same
manner and then 3 buttons
south of the middle mouse button and and
then of course left and right and all
buttons aside from left Mouse can be
mapped to custom macros or bindings as I
explained in a previous video if you're
interested how to do that it is online
on the channel and the mouse uses an
Avago excuse me if I'm saying that wrong
and a vago supplied a dns 9800 sensor so
it is not made in house it is it is
supplied externally it is the same
sensor used in Logitech g600 Mouse and
is rated for 8200 dpi in a step an
interval of 200 dpi Avago sensors can be
found in pretty much any major
manufacturers Mouse including products
made by Coolermaster and Logitech so
they are tested and you've probably used
them without knowing it the sensor
itself can tolerate 30 G's of
acceleration and operates at 150 IPs
placing it as average to upper class
when compared against similarly priced
mice in the high-end category as this
one would be in terms of other hardware
found inside of the mouse we see 32
kilobytes of memory and switches in the
form of t-mek and those are the the
brown switches you see in the video t
max which is used for the peripheral
buttons and then Imran supplied
components for the left and right
buttons the buttons are rated for 8
million clicks so the same as the
original Logitech G five but still
significantly
less than Logitech's new G gaming series
products which are rated at 20 million
clicks and that's really both those
numbers are so freaking huge that it's
really hard to put it into perspective
I've been using a g5 for about four
years now I just stopped recently four
years at eight million clicks and
haven't had a problem so that should
give you a you know an anecdotal even
outlier non-scientific look at
theoretically how long eight million
clicks would last but let's get back to
the Gila in terms of aesthetics the Gila
mouse is obviously meant to look a bit
jagged and fierce and in the full
article review I refer to the mouse's
body several times as refer as
resembling a Lamborghini almost for its
overly flashy wide but design it just
it's really wide and strange toward the
rear of the mouse there are LEDs located
in the front grille region rear grille
and scroll wheel and then one in the
rear logo plate all of these are
customizable there's its standard 16
million RGB LED lighting you can
customize all that in the software and
basically make it pulse or be stable or
whatever you want and pretty much any
color you want so that's pretty neat and
as a whole that aesthetic isn't too bad
it's interesting despite my my wide but
insults but the in terms of what I think
of the mouse in terms of actual opinions
it's pretty divided between
functionality and ergonomics all the
buttons are within reach and very easy
to configure so I found myself using
every button with great regularity when
playing MMOs like rift and though they
tended to get ignored with other mice so
like the G 600 it was it felt really
complex and kind of hard to mentally map
what the the buttons did in-game so some
of those get ignored from time to time
but with this mouse it actually works
fairly well and a memo is just because
of how distanced but reachable they are
the added buttons for multiple on-screen
hotbars and MMOs is really where the
mouse excels it doesn't you don't really
gain much an RTS or FPS play and
the buttons are positioned in separate
geographic locations it's easy to
memorize what they do as I said I really
would like to see more Mouse companies
following geniuses lead with button
placement as I think they've done it
right with that said though I was really
disappointed by the shape of the body
for the mouse it's just it's jagged
which is kind of cool looking but it's
really awkward to hold and the nature
the jagged nature of the rear of the
mouse makes it difficult to position at
least my hand comfortably yours may be
different and that's that's problem with
reviewing mice where we don't really
have an objective way to analyze that
but for me and I want to stress this was
for me it was uncomfortable to hold I
did get used to it but still felt kind
of weird particularly the ring and pinky
fingers which sort of end up either
dragging along the mounting surface or
being awkwardly tweaked to fit on the
mouse which was very uncomfortable if
the right side of the mouse were more
rounded I think it'd be a whole lot
easier to hold for those of us with
wrist problems if you have smaller hands
I think you can probably overlook
everything I just said because you
probably won't have a problem at all
because the the mouse really looks like
it's made more for people with smaller
hands and if you don't think our
economics are concerned for you but you
you really do like the button
functionality of the Gila well
definitely look into getting it and with
that I'll leave you to check out the
full review linked below for more
details more opinions if you have any
questions please post them in the
comments below I will see you all next
