CES 2018 we're gonna look at something
we didn't get a chance to look at before
leaving for CES which is the BIOS for
the new n7 motherboard this is the
motherboard we previously did a video on
the hardware side of it it's called the
n7 it's a $300 III 70 motherboard for
Intel platforms and a lot of the prices
derived from the integrated RGB and fan
controllers the hue and the grid
products that are basically sold
separately but integrated as opposed to
higher-end VRMs and things like that
before that this coverage is brought to
you by Thermaltake and the flow liquid
cooler the flow is a 360 millimeter
radiator with three ring RGB LED fans
you can program the fans our custom
lighting through software and then of
course benefit from the larger radiator
size and cooling performance
learn more at the link in the
description below so the board doesn't
take quite the same approach as most the
$300 boards we've looked at which means
the BIOS is going to be a little bit
more basic but it's trying to solve
different problems we'll talk about that
more in the review and the time comes
for that after the show
for now though I did want to go through
BIOS and show off what we haven't gotten
the show this is the basic BIOS most
motherboards have one at this point and
it's I mean it's pretty simple you have
a normal mode in performance mode and
it's got a graphic icon indicator and
that's about the end of that side of
things
performance just pre overclocks it I
would assume it's using a lookup table
like every other motherboard for pre
overclock setting on the CPU that's
installed which in this case is an 8700
K and you've got time some voltages and
that's that's most a boot order as well
if we go over to Advanced Mode to get to
the more interesting stuff and that will
you start off with a standard main tab
right here so nothing special there in
time language we go over to CPU and RAM
is where most of the action is so CPU
settings is you've got standard est
turbo boost all these pretty standard
features to have from Intel there are
power limit overrides and I guess I
think you can even straight disabled on
which is always good I don't know to
what the
and power limits correspond so there's
one two three and four we'll figure that
out later
but you've got four power limits I would
assume one is probably a core power or
core current or something like that and
only you can you can toggle the current
limits for overclocking purposes but you
go in here and then you can set in
either just straight disable it or type
in a manual number which in this case is
input in milliwatts so you can limit the
wattage going to whatever device power
limit 3 is in this case TDP locks here
as well nothing too special their ratios
as expected you just manually set either
the all core ratios we go to 50 if the
CPU could support 50 I'm not sure if it
does which is more CPU thin but CB ratio
for all of them or you just manually
enter over here there's a couple a
couple changes that I think may still be
in the pipe so we'll look at that more
later rein ratio you also have which is
good so we can set rein ratio and BC LK
was in there as well but it is in one
100th of megahertz increments which is a
bit different typically you have like
100 point one or 100 point five or
whatever so this one is one one
hundredth divide all your numbers
accordingly and and same idea over all
memory settings this is where
motherboards really differentiate
themselves in terms of overclocking
support but 90% of users probably never
really go through these so there is you
just go default XMP as expected or
custom and for custom there's not a I
mean to call out a couple items here T
RFC's in here TR efi is in here so those
are both good things that you want to
have access to for for overclocking
purposes it's missing a couple of the
really low-level sub timings but again
it's not really the point of the board
to target that type of thing so kind of
up to you how important that is if it's
really important than buy different
motherboard but GT slice is in here
that's not actually something we use
very often or see very often that's for
the integrated graphics voltages CPU
voltages are present so you can auto set
or you can go through a list rather than
typing in right now you go through a
list and point
0-5 increments all the weight I think
it's all the way down
yes point zero five all the way through
to two volts which of course he should
never set unless you're you really know
you're doing with liquid nitrogen or
liquid helium
other than that vccs a so essays in here
that's good I would like to see some
more granularity in here or just manual
typing of the number because one point
six six one point six nine five kind of
a big jump shouldn't really be going
that high anyway typically once you're
at there's no one point four zero either
I'd like to see that that's about my
stopping point for Si voltages because
that's when things start to die very
quickly IO goes all the way to I think
it's pretty much where we want it yeah
one no one point four zero and this one
either or one point three five but it's
got every other number in increments of
0.2 0.2 jiz are also present this is
actually good I like this so it actually
will instead of putting Auto at the top
it puts Auto where the present voltage
setting is for the dims which in this
case is one point two one eight so we're
getting Auto between one point in that
general area just right here what
technically would be it put red for it
probably won't boot at this voltage
yellow for it maybe you won't boot at
this voltage because it's too low and on
the opposite end of the scale the other
way red or yellow because getting
dangerous territory theoretically and
this all motherboards do this to where
they don't actually really know where it
gets dangerous or not they just take a
best guess this isn't just NZXT that's
that's how everyone does it because it's
unreasonable to assume otherwise so
they're just giving you guidelines as
and don't don't go red unless you know
you're doing on quarters present so
there's a non core voltage offset which
is also good and that's really most of
it so that's that's most the lower level
settings there's I don't you can toggle
multi monitor for the IGP you're not
really going to be buying this board for
mining so you don't need the 4gd code
support because no one would buy a $300
board for mining with this that's clear
they're not targeted for that advanced
setting the CPU typical disable hyper
threading change which cores are active
there's some sea state stuff so you can
mess around with that if you want to are
just straight disable it elsewhere and I
think might be a couple of hands
fan control so this is kind of I like
this at first I was kind of like wait a
minute this is weird but if you think
about it this board supports something
like nine fans through the grid
controller and so they've got a
drop-down menu more or less where you
can select each fan which is labeled
according to the motherboard headers so
this is preferable in this situation
because if you had nine fans listed with
every one of these settings four of
those all the way down it'd be huge and
taking forever to get through so I do
like that choice a Seuss's gets a little
bit difficult to navigate sometimes for
that reason and then you can use cam to
override everything else if you prefer
going that route I don't know that
there's a lot else to show in this BIOS
I think that's pretty much most of it so
there is uh there's per core
overclocking if you want that couple
chipset options and then you can just go
back to the basic mode for the pre OC
which we haven't haven't really looked
at too much yet but it does apply NOC to
individual cores which tells me it's
probably a lookup table so a pretty
standard for that and then we'll look at
the rest as the show concludes here so
we've got a full review coming
eventually of the NZXT and seven for
nowadays you look at BIOS pretty much
most the options for kind of more casual
users are there if you're looking for
something no aesthetics focused and then
we've talked to them about a couple of
suggestions for more granularity and a
couple of the existing options so well
