Nexus dotnet and this Saturday heat
signature episode 7 where we are going
to talk about the indie action title
waveform is actually a very cool title
they label it as casual as well but it
is a pretty challenging game so I don't
know that most casual players would like
it but if you are a completionist if you
love challenge games and if you love
games like platformers they then you
would probably really like waveform so
let's talk a little bit about what it is
but we see right now we are flying
through the solar system in space
obviously and the game is your plan as a
particle of light essentially and your
goal is to navigate your beam of light
through space and collect different orbs
that are scattered throughout the area
and you can use all kinds of objects out
in space to your advantage like mirrors
and and you have to avoid things like
dark matter which will of course affect
your light negatively so it is a space
game you do go through the solar system
your objective is to bring your light to
the Sun our Sun of course and you are
also discovering the mysteries that are
causing different troubles in the solar
system like distortion of one of plutos
moons or stuff like that it is again
very challenging puzzle sort of action
element game so your light particle you
need to adjust your trajectory using the
mouse you drag it left and right to
increase the wavelength drag it up and
down to increase or decrease the
amplitude and your goal is to just
adjust this trajectory adjust your wave
so that it will line up with all the
orbs scattered through space and you
pick them up and it's actually a lot
harder than that though it sounds pretty
easy and it looks pretty easy on the
screen but the way the orbs are
scattered is actually very well done by
the game designer or the level designer
or whomever works on those maps because
it's not perfectly lined up so you might
line up your path perfectly you couldn't
do it any better for a huge cluster of
orbs and then the next one is just
slightly off and so you have to panic
and readjust your path and try and
intercept those as well and if you screw
up your path then there's very little
chance you'll recover it so you have to
make the split-second decision
I abandoned this cluster of orbs and try
to regroup on the next one or do I try
to salvage these orbs and then still try
to get the next one's very tough
decision and that's what makes the game
so hard it does take some quick thinking
even though it starts off a little slow
but on that note I would like to add
that there is no tutorial really for
this game other than a couple of screens
with text it drops you straight into the
action which personally I love I feel
like I feel like tutorials can be
insulting sometimes in games where you
really just want to get the plane right
away you don't need a whole bunch of
hand-holding but this game definitely
drops you in and it does a very good job
of it too and it does a great job of
ramping you up throughout the game
throughout each level there are many
objectives of course the primary
objective is to get to the end of the
level and get out through the through
the wormhole i suppose i'm not sure what
the proper name is but there is a will
call it a wormhole at the end of the
level you get out through it and
throughout the level there are many
objectives like collecting rings that
are scattered throughout there and they
will give you multipliers for when
you're picking up different colored orbs
of course your overall goal is to just
get the most points and to accumulate
points and you can either sort of play
against yourself against your own
records or you can get on the world
leader boards and that's really fun with
these types of games because it gives
you something to really work at and you
can play it sort of against your friends
and compare scores and stuff like that
you know these types of games pretty
well just as all of us do so there are
some bonus levels other than the ones
I'll show some right now actually there
is a distortion effect level which is on
one of the moons and that distortion
just completely messes up how easy or
how hard it is to see the orbs because
it sort of makes it actually reminds me
a lot of yoshi story where yo she eats
or yoshi's island maybe Rio she eats one
of the pink floating flowers and he gets
all drugs that is exactly what this
looks like to me I don't know if anyone
else has seen that but it is a pretty
cool level and it does mix things up we
also have another distortion type level
where there's a pulsing light visibility
so the light is visible you can see all
of the orbs for just a few seconds you
gotta line up your path perfectly and
then the screen goes black and it comes
back and you have a second to see
what did I get do I need to adjust my
path very challenging level so again if
you like challenging games this is your
thing to play and it's only a couple
bucks let me check it's actually six
dollars on Steam right now so an easy
pick up really though the beauty of the
game is in its gameplay mechanics and
the way you use the mouse to adjust
wavelength and amplitude so you can
achieve those objectives you get all
those orbs is pretty hard actually but
it is a great game I have trouble
relating the gameplay to any other game
out there which is good because that
means it is unique I think the closest I
can do is say it's some kind of weird
mix between audiosurf and guitar hero
and and platformers something like that
if that makes any sense to you but again
getting back to mechanics there are all
kinds of different elements to interact
with in the levels it does a as I said
before a very good job at dropping you
and slowly and really ramping you up
ramping up the difficulty over time and
eventually working you out to be a very
good player but it does take some time
to get to that point so some of the
stuff you might interact with you can
use mirrors to bounce off of that you
break the mirror and it'll bounce you
and give you kind of my second kind of
like a double jump in your arc there are
also clouds that refract there's dark
matter that when you collide with dark
matter it will destroy all the orbs
around you and sort of invalidate that
path you are on so very tough to work in
between dark matter spots and the actual
hordes that is just one of the many
obstacles in the game aside from space
mines dry another huge annoyance but at
the end of every level or at the end of
every planet i should say each planet in
our solar system is broken up into
several levels where you have to sort of
work your way through the orbit i'm
going to call it of the planet and
eventually you hit some of the moons and
stuff like that and each moon of course
is a bonus level as i said earlier and
each planet has at the very end level
and event horizon that chases you which
makes it much harder to complete or much
harder to win and really makes it that
much more pressure to get all the worms
and get out of that level as soon as
possible so again there is not a whole
lot more to say it is a very challenging
game but that's really the point of it
is to be challenging to really push you
as a player can become that
at this game there isn't a huge story
there's a little bit but that's not the
reason you play a game like this so
again let's recap here if you like
platformers if you like games that
require a little bit of thinking but
aren't quite a puzzle game and if you
like action games that can be very fast
and challenging and you don't get super
frustrated and throw your keyboard
easily then I would say this is your
kind of game it's only a couple bucks
and it is a space themed game so that's
another bonus for those of us that like
space themed games which is really what
pulled me on in the first place it all
comes down to just moving your mouse to
set up those perfect paths so I guess
actually you could say that it's sort of
related to Tetris in that way where
you're just trying to fit things in but
not so much anyway I think that's all
for now everyone so catch us next time
and please subscribe if you like this
video like it if you like this video and
of course leave comments if you have any
questions at all about the game I will
get back to you and let you know
whatever you want to know so catch us
next time i'll have saturday heat
signature episode 8 next week and then
we have packs coming up i believe in two
weeks now so we will be at PAX East with
several people which means I might not
get a heat signature up on that saturday
but i will try a nun the less so i will
catch you guys next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
