Nexus net and today we're looking at TT
eSports Aziz's tracfone a mousepad and
this is a new mouse pad from TT eSports
TT eSports is a subdivision or group of
Thermaltake who are some of the makers
of cases like the t-80 one that we
looked at at CES the core v1 and other
things like that the eSports division is
responsible for peripherals and things
like mice and keyboards and mouse pads
so that's what we're looking at today we
look at track home mousepad I just hit
the camera there and this is the pad
we're talking about so this is an
aluminum pad it is 2 millimeters thick
and actually the dimensions read 5
millimeters because it has these rubber
feet that basically boost it up and make
it stick to your surface and there goes
one of the rubber feet we'll talk about
that in a moment
so this is an aluminum pad it has a
polymer surface as far as I am aware and
it's dual sided one side is smoother and
that would be this one and one side is a
bit rougher and the rougher surface is
kind of like a lighter version of a
skateboard grip tape it gives your mouse
a bit more grip enos to the surface if
you're kind of whipping it around if you
play with a low dpi and if you're
playing with a higher dpi I need some
precision then the smooth surface well
it it moves pretty damn quickly when
you're moving your mouse around and it
also will preserve the Teflon feet a
little bit of your mouse whereas the
grip your side does tend to wear them
down a bit more from experience with my
razor exact Mac pad that I reviewed
previously about a hundred years ago so
this is 360 millimeters by 300
millimeters by 5 millimeters and that is
about 14 inches by 11 by 0.2 inches I
think and that means it's pretty damn
big it takes up a lot of real estate on
your desk it is a $40 mouse pad that
seems somewhat expensive but I paid $40
for this razor one in 2009 and I still
use it so that kind of tells you this is
also aluminum it tells you how long
these things last this is five years in
this case so it's a good investment if
you like the pad the razor one comes
with
a a gel wrist rest that goes under the
pad and just holds it in place and also
gives your wrist something to sit on if
you have wrist issues and that helps you
in my case that is what I need this does
not come with a gel wrist rest that's
okay if you don't need one if you need
one you know you need one and you can
buy one separately if you want the pad
otherwise you're out of luck in terms of
unique features the track coding pad
comes with this Mouse tether it is a
bungee and basically the cable goes into
this slot here and that keeps the mouse
from getting away from you it keeps
longer cables in check if you've got
them and ultimately will will just make
your desk a bit neater and it is a two
piece it just assembles with a rubber
snap so it's pretty easy to transport
and for this you clip it anywhere on the
pad it just has a rubber slot here so
you kind of slide that around the edge
of the aluminum and it'll stay in place
as soon as you put it down on the desk
which didn't happen here because it was
floating there but when it's on the desk
it stays in place pretty well so in
terms of this mousepad there goes
another rubber foot if we need to talk
about that the issues I have with this
are pretty much resolvable once you get
it on a surface the rubber feet come
flying off pretty easily as you can see
when you're handling it like I am but
once you've got it fixed on your desk
and you're not moving it anymore they'll
stay in place and I'll keep the mouse
pad in place if you move it around a lot
we're gonna get kind of frustrated
because they come off extremely easily I
wish the the holes in the pad would kind
of clip to the feet a little better but
that is a small complaint and the scheme
of things
the bungee I am really happy with those
used to retail for like thirty dollars
separately when they were brand new
several years ago now they're a bit more
standard they come with these pads and I
think that's a great feature that's one
of the unique things are on this pad I
wish this came with a gel wrist rest
even if that cost me five dollars extra
I would prefer a gel wrist rest because
I use one so if you're like me then
maybe that is a knock to the pad that
would make you come
alternatives but other than that the
mouse moves very smoothly on the smooth
surface it has high precision I used the
tunable Logitech Proteus port mouse when
I was gaming and it's pretty accurate I
like the precision of the pad it's
definitely good for the laser sensor and
the obstacle sensors I've used in terms
of buying this I'm going to throw some
alternatives up on the screen so you can
see what else is out there I really like
the razer exact mat it is unfortunately
no longer made it's a bit smaller as you
can see here it will fit on most tests
much easier so it is a bit smaller and
it's about the same spec but it's old
and they don't make it anymore they have
a new one that I'm putting up on the
screen it's like a best feel that's
something like that it's not some
unusable Razer name as they often do it
doesn't have the bungee that Thermaltake
has so I I do really like that bungee
I'm kind of spoiled by now to be honest
I like the pad keep an eye out on the
size keep an eye out on the on the
rubber feet on the wrist rest and all
those things considered it's really not
a bad mousepad just looking at the
alternatives there are a lot of
alternatives out there so there might be
something that fits your use case a bit
better depending on size and wrist needs
and I will see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
