roller coaster tycoon world which
probably brains about as much dread as
it does excitement at this point Atari
announced that players will be able to
play the game on March 30th through
steam's early access program and that is
with a fifty dollar price tag slapped on
to allow players access from the 30th
through launch and of course onward
during this time you'll get to play the
game with updates as they roll out and
when and if the project ever completes
that will be the point at which early
access is of course unlocked to the full
version of the game interestingly one of
our previous meetings with Atari
explicitly discussed the topic of early
access and other pre-launch purchasing
models Atari seems opposed to the idea
of any kind of early access other than
of course these sort of standard betas
at the time and indicated that they'd
strongly prefer to ship a complete game
all at once and this was for some of the
obvious reasons mainly to avoid a
scenario where players play it in a
really access get bored of it and move
on because the game is simply not
complete and this change of mood to move
to an early access model has this a bit
curious about the revenue available to
complete the game and if planet coaster
might be putting on more pressure for
the RCT W team then Atari is letting on
good news if you own a 3d printer and a
steam controller valve it released all
the cad geometry for their controller to
the public meaning you can make your own
designs print them and customize your
controller to start off with valve
released to alternate designs for the
battery cover on the controller but once
you dig your CAD initiated friend and 3d
printer out of the closet your
imagination will be the only limit on
what you can do and 3d print materials
and skill and time and ability and a lot
of things really but it's an admirable
idea and ties in with valves previous
statement that the controller was meant
to be a modular release and something
that they build upon as time moves
forward after a couple quiet months
battleborn announced its beta period at
this week beginning april 13th
battleborn will enter open beta on pc
and until april eighteenth players will
get access to all 25 characters the full
progressions
them and all the gear unfortunately the
progress you make and items you unlock
won't carry over to full release but
this of course may be a good thing
because it sets everyone on an equal
playing field once launched you can
however still join other players into of
battle borns story mode episode called
incursion and meltdown those interested
also get a very healthy pre-download
period starting on the 6th of april
finally ND devs heart-machine revealed
the launch date for a hyper light
drifter to be march 31st it's been
almost three years since hyper light
drifter was successfully kick-started
and now the hack and slash title is set
to launch gameplay and HL d is inspired
by The Legend of Zelda games with the
splash of Diablo and players lead the
drifter through the ruins of Forgotten
civilizations to find a cure for the
drifters life-threatening illness the
story itself draws heavily from creator
Alex Preston's own experiences with
heart disease and along with the release
date heart machine also displayed the
final trailer showing off even more of
the beautiful pixelated world of the
