the Thermaltake booth now so they have
three new cases we're gonna focus on
today along with a thread river block
which is a w6 block thread river blocks
this year a bit popular likely because
of the impending threader for to launch
targeted for around April so August
rather August well go with that one
sorry talking about those today before
that this video is brought to you by the
cable Mod vertical GPU adapter a
universal kit that lets you add a
vertical GPU mount to almost any
enclosure the vertical GPU adapts our
positions video cards further back from
the glass than most stock vertical GPU
mounts aiding in thermals and also
easily sockets into the PCIe expansion
slots of compatible cases the after kit
is brand new and makes it easy to show
off video cards even in cases that don't
include a stock vertical GPU map learn
more at the link in the description
below the first case to bring up here is
the level twenty GT so get the
housekeeping out of the way all of these
are branded level 20 the one behind me
is kind of the og level 20 got a couple
of updates like the paint and these ones
are new but they follow the same design
narrative we'll call it so the level 20
GT right here the first main thing I
want to talk about is the rotatable PCIe
expansion slots so the expansion slots
in the back you can actually flip the
bracket and do horizontal or vertical
GPU mounts if you want and it does
support multiple PCIe devices when
horizontal obviously multi-gpu not the
most popular these days and yes
obviously you will have kind of thermal
limitations at some point but if you
want to do single GPU which is a bit
more common you can rotate the entire
bracket and because it's a wider bracket
and a wider case able to set the GPU
back a bit so this is something that
we've commented on a lot in the last
year where vertical GPUs that are not
open-loop cooled basically suffocate and
by setting the card back significantly
from the glass several inches back it
will actually be able to breathe I don't
probably horizontal will always perform
better but as long as you're not killing
the performance in terms of thermal
rewards which chokes the frequency then
it's fine so we have to give props if
they don't take their for setting back
the GPU further from the glass which
some vendors are starting to figure out
as that actually will allow it the card
to breathe a bit so props there for that
level 20 GT is still kind of TBD on some
of the specs but they're looking at a
potential $190 option with one 140
million fan and an alternative is 290
bucks so $100 Delta there let them know
what you think I suppose of the two
options but the hundred extra dollars
would be to two hundred millimeter fans
in the front and then a 140 millimeter
fan in the back all RGB I believe of
course it wouldn't have it any other way
these days so to hundreds in the front
there can be two to hundreds in the top
as well and then in terms of air flow
this case is probably a little bit more
concerning than the others I guess it
depends on what you're going for if
you're going for an open-loop you can
kind of hand wave some of that stuff in
terms of air cooling so there's a
radiator mount where typically your hard
drive cages would go back in the old
days and radiator mount there it
exhausts basically straight into a glass
panel not the best but for the front
there is a bit of a cutout here I've
asked that they consider potentially
cutting back the glass even more because
of contrary to what you might think the
view 71 which does have all glass
everywhere is able to cool pretty well
and they were able to do that by making
bigger gaps in the paneling so it is
possible to do this look and not suffer
for it thermally this one does need a
bit of work I'll be honest I need to cut
back the last a bit and the exhaust with
the side mount radiator is really just
going into a wall so a bit of a problem
there but otherwise it's a showroom
piece I do really like the flippable
PCIe expansion slots on it because that
is something that is genuinely a bit
different and should help with thermals
on the GPU if you want a vertical card
so that's the level 20 GT as noted end
of July target launch and not 100% sure
on price but 192 to 90 depending also
brand new tooling and I'll just throw
this in as well 360 millimetre rent
radiator support for mounting rads the
next one level 20 xt so it's just super
wide basically it's kind of like the old
w9 if you remember that or the x9 rather
so it's the core x9 tooling for this
case with the level 22 xt and this one
is currently outfitted with two to
hundreds in the front they're all takes
how high percent sure again on the stock
fans back there trying to figure out
what people want if they want it
bare-bones and you fill it with your own
fans or if you buy it with fans and use
those let them know
something that a lot of vendors are
actually very unsure about other than
that so it's got dual power supply
support it is also basically
compartmentalized so they've got kind of
a split level going on we're straight
across the middle or 2/3 about 1/3 up
2/3 down there's a tray for the
motherboard full ATX support and then
you can orient the GPU so it faces out
of the glass on the side panel and then
separately the top up here still kind of
being finalized what the radiator
support is but it'll be big so can fit a
lot of radiators very large size is a
showcase that looks I mean it's it's the
size of a fish tank so you can fit a lot
in there if you want us to do like a
super custom open loop or something like
that so that one level 20 XD pricing TBD
and core x9 tooling end of July target
for 140 millimeter support at the top so
you could maybe something like a 380 or
something like that the next case is the
level 20 bTW this is the most
interesting one to me this is a micro
ATX case a lot of you have expressed
interest in micro ATX cases lately and
we saw it at Silverstone this one's kind
of the it's it basically instead of
vertical they're going with a wider kind
of original v21
as sizing for it so b21 super match set
up v1 very much set up this one's going
for glass they still sell the V 21 in
the v1 so in terms of mesh if you want
it's already out there so the VT has
gone glass on that and the VT has a set
up of pricing TBD probably July
availability for this one as well micro
ATX it is all the paneling to the glass
panels the glass is attached to steel
which is attached to the chassis so if
you want to invert or change the layout
move the panel's of different size you
can do that pretty easily just like the
V 1 V 21 it's all modular so if you want
one on the other side you can do it if
you want to do and in terms of the rest
of the case currently setup for a 200
millimeter intake probably stock and
then also a 120 or 140 in the back two
hundred eighty millimeter radiator
support on the side and thermally
they've got a bit of a gap on the side
panel closest to me on the right side of
the case for air flow to exhaust out
from the radiator so the doing the most
you can with glass I guess obviously we
love Matt
options I guess the argument is if the
v21 still out there they have a mesh
option already so that's that's kind of
the argument against that but the front
they've cut back the glass as far as
they can so it does have a decent amount
of side intake I'd love to see some more
by either setting in the curves on the
borders or setting out the glass I think
you kind of sacrifice the looks there
though so not the best approach if if I
were designing the case but if you have
ideas again let them know and then
finally there is there's one more case
so this one is still prototype phase
it's the a500
if you haven't had enough 500 so
remember eh 580 500 pH 500 MMH 580 500 I
then they have another one it's the a
500 also 500 D I should know 500 some
very popular number this year so a 500
is an ATX case new tooling 360 rad top
and front power supply shroud is
included $229 probably the target with
three fans no LEDs on those and they're
considering doing an LED option but it
would have to be more expensive so a
very difficult trade-off to make you'll
have to let them know what you think
aluminium and tempered glass for the
paneling absolutely no plastic on the
outside at all no plastic I think in the
case so it's all metal mostly aluminium
and steel no time frame for release and
finally two more things that is a thread
ripper a i/o plan so if you want to
close with a liquid cooler thread ripper
probably coming out eventually don't
know any specs on it yet turner for two
is for august this year as noted and
then this is zw6
for the four threader for cooling so we
haven't seen inside the block but it is
full coverage on the plate and then I
can see the microphones in there I just
don't know where they line up with the
thighs but keep an eye out for it
probably launching flow straight to
thread Ripper twos launch and that's the
normal take booth as always thank you
for watching subscribe for more Computex
coverage we'll have a lot of it she
definitely subscribe hey John comm /
gamers ex tops out directly gonna stored
on camera sex it's not net to pick up
one of our own mod mats I'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
