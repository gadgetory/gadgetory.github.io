donna at CES 2015 i enjoyed by richard
garriott also known as Lord British and
Richard worked on the Ultima series now
we're talking about shroud of the avatar
which is a spiritual successor right to
ultima all this content brought to you
by CyberPower cyber vapor gaming pc
right now we're talking about user
created content so can you give us a
top-level sort of philosophy for your
user created approach yeah well you know
one of things we realized fairly early
on his right of the avatar was you know
just like Ultima Online we wanted to
have a highly interdependent crafting
capability for players with it makes the
economy very healthy but once we started
down that path we realized that we could
actually get completely out of the way
of players if we basically got out of
creating content and what I mean by that
is that every sword every chair every
piece of clothing is not only are the
resources gathered by the player
community and those things created by
the player community but they all have
makers marks they all have history and
so even the epic loot that you know in
other games you might see that the the
team has created an attaches to a
particular drop in our case as the
players create items nassos items gain
history and and are imbued with the
magical powers if they are either lost
or sold to stores in the game instead of
destroying them we bank them and then
later we when a when a skeleton and a
dungeon needs a sword it goes to that
bank and withdraws a player created
sword with an actual history and and so
we're taking that really as far as we
can we're we're we're trying to get out
of the content creation game entirely
making all of the best things in the
game player created what are you doing
in terms of worrying about balancing
with the economy or flooding the economy
is that sort of what your reallocation
is handling exactly and so you know all
the same goes resources are going into
the game and the drains to take them out
of the game as you might find in the way
to traditionally balance the economy of
the game we just instead of keeping that
outside value in gold we actually keep
it the stock of everything that's been
made previously
and so you know there may be an occasion
you know if the game really needs a
bunch of axes and the players have never
made acts as before that the game will
invent a few generic axes to populate
the world with but we're already finding
that players are creating you know it
tools and equipment much faster than the
game needs to spawn them and so we don't
we don't have a resource problem that
sense we will actually end up ultimately
destroying something to run needed
versus ever probably having to create
content again and we were speaking out
music pre-interview so my understanding
is that the players got together and
worked on some of your music for the
game can you give us a bit of history on
that yeah in fact it's way more than
some at this point it's actually all of
the music you know it's funny that when
we were going down the you know since or
a crowd-funded game you know we're
trying to be very frugal with every
dollar and so when it came around to
music I was lamenting the fact that you
know that I either had allocate this
very large amount of money for music or
take music on that I was really not
happy with you know either stuff that
you could dig it with an inexpensive
license that was already pre written for
example and and the community stepped up
and said and tried to offer some
suggestions or some creations and
originally frankly it was a lot of
techno stuff instead of just be
inappropriate and and so as I was
turning them down and not finding this
answer the community actually
self-organized created the group called
the poet's circle and they got together
and said Richard you know give us a
really detailed description of what it
is you're looking for and I said well
you know good luck but here you know I
but I spent a couple of days riding up
in detail what I was actually looking
for and analyzed all the music and all
the ultimate have done in the past which
ones I liked which ones I didn't did why
and they went okay we get it and they
went off by themselves for about two
months and after about two months they
had developed a whole process they had
run their own Kickstarter to get new
equipment and new software and new sound
samples and and they began to critique
each other's work and it needed that
period and they produced me to be five
originally in all five I was incredibly
excited about put them all five in the
game and now every piece they've made
sense has made into the game with few if
any comments and how about other aspects
of the game for play
created content art or sound effects or
things like that yeah and so we do arts
probably five or ten percent the art
right now is crowd or community created
and and we're helping the community get
better at that so i'll probably be doing
more of that sound effects is something
we're just now moving on to that will be
ultimately ninety ninety-five percent
all player created and we even have an
example of code we have this thing
called the avatars radio which started
as a website just broadcasting news and
music and information about the game
through a webcast but then the community
got together and made a literally a
physical radio object and then wrote the
code then we could just drop into the
game that simulcast that radio station
into the game and as a 3d position
object and so now that is used for you
know people go up and give plays people
give sermons on the virtues people
simulcast all the PvP tournament
tournaments into the game by voice it's
actually turned out to be a very
exciting feature that was conceived
created and written all by the community
do you do you have an in fiction
explanation for this object we do and
fortunately we had already started we
already introduced a little bit of
technology in the game so sort of Tesla
coil like energy fences and things
already existed and the bigger cities
already have wind power water power
geothermal power to power some of these
a little bit of technology that was in
the game so so since we already had that
little bit of electrical tech it was a
good enough excuse for us to say that a
radio could work in those cities as well
a lot of companies that do user to
create content but valve is an easy
example will compensate their users are
you are you doing that actually we are
you know in fact you know we believe
fundamentally anybody helping us make
the game is saving us time and money and
so we offer cash bounties on all
everything that we can think of that
that we think community might be able to
do we put a bounty assigned to that and
then people are allowed to take that
bounty is cash which some do although it
more often people take it we also offer
twice that cash bounty as in game pledge
Valley
you and the majority of people take the
pledge value in a way to kind of sponsor
their own habits of playing the game
yeah fun we have it as it were so I
closes out here where can people go to
learn more about shroud of the avatar
out of the Avatar calm so come come join
us if you were ever a fan of the Ultima
series or if you're too young to have

successor in our mind so come join us
