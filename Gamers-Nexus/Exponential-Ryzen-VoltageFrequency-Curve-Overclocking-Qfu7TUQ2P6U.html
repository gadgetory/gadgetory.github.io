two was its reduced voltage requirement
at a given clock discussed in our 2700 X
review our r7 1700 required at least one
point 4 volts to one point four to five
to maintain four gigahertz stability in
our most torturous workloads but our
2,700 X only required one point one six
to to hold the same frequency under
today's torture
this drew our attention because we
already knew that our 2,700 X could
barely manage 4.2 gigahertz at one point
four to five volts without modifying
base clock though it could do so with
base clock changes more readily in other
words there was a five percent increase
in frequency from 4 to 4.2 gigahertz but
a 22 point 6 percent increase in
reported voltage requirement today we're
talking about the Volt frequency curve
for the new Rison 2 processors before
that this is brought to you by the msi
gtx 1080 gaming X and Nvidia's GeForce
experience which allows you to retro
actively capture key gameplay moments
with shadowplay convert captures into
gifs with new tools and apply filters to
games hashtag no filter Emma sighs
gaming X PCBs are high quality with well
built power management and coolers that
we've previously recommended learn more
at the links in the description below
frequency with Rison - is beginning to
act a lot like GPU boost 3.0 or other
modern GPU boosting features where
basically your frequency is almost more
dictated or predicated on the
temperature and the voltage and the
power than anything else it's not like
it's just a fixed number anymore
the boosting frequency Headroom is
entirely dependent on other factors so
provided you have thermal Headroom
provided you have power budget and
provide your voltage is low enough that
you have both of those things because
the voltage will impact the power
consumption and the thermals you can
boost higher automatically and boost
higher or even just manually
overclocking you can get it higher with
a lower temperature to some degree so
we've tested a lot of this and our
initial experience with Rison - led us
to believe that the volt frequency curve
would be almost exponential to the point
where we can put one on the screen as
purely an example where as you kind of
approach the end of the stable
frequencies the voltage
required to hold those stable
frequencies it shoots up like a rocket
so this is our hypothesis basically that
it's a somewhat exponential curve to
maintain stability as clock continues to
push upwards and to be very clear here
we have been able to overclock higher or
more stable at least by using reference
clock overclocking what we're doing
today though is strictly tuning the
multiplier and the core and we're
leaving everything else controlled so we
only want two variables for this one
right now our biggest limiter here will
be thermal risin two does actually run a
bit warm especially as you begin
overclock in it we typically do these
tests with an NZXT kraken X 60 to 280
millimeter cooler max out fans and pump
as we progressed through testing we
realize that we're running into a
thermal barrier as the voltage pushed up
to 1.4 and Beyond and frequency to 4.2
and Beyond and so we eventually switched
over to the flow 360 radiator from
thermal take with three maglev fans on
it which gave us enough Headroom to push
through the rest of our testing so
typically again we run out of thermal
Headroom before we run into a an unsafe
voltage as you might call it so our
concern is less about killing the CPU
with too much of voltage because we know
we're not going to get there without
basically exotic cooling or sub ambient
cooling or something like that so again
the hypothesis here is that at
increasing frequencies the required
voltage for both chips the 720 700 X
rapidly increases out of a maintainable
range thermally and the vertical
difference between the lines in our
theoretical graph at a given frequency
should become huge one point four to
five volts versus one point one six to
for example at four gigahertz however at
a given voltage the horizontal
difference remains minor four gigahertz
versus four point two gigahertz at one
point four three ish bolts or 1.40 and
based on this knowledge this curve again
is what we expected to see but it's just
an example let's look at some real data
well begin with just the results table
for the r7 1700 at the low end we were
able to maintain a minimum stable
voltage of one point zero six nine volts
for 3.5 gigahertz all core producing a
TDI of 49 degrees Celsius at 7 amps at
the EPS 12-volt rails equating 86 watts
of power draw
increasing by 100 megahertz to 3.6
gigahertz required an additional 0.037
five volts and increased temperature by
a few degrees with power draw increased
by seven watts the next 100 megahertz
jump required 0.04 four volts with
another 100 Hertz on top of that going
to 3.8 gigahertz now requiring 0.06
volts it's becoming clear how this is a
nonlinear voltage requirement 3.9
gigahertz required an additional 0.075
volts on top of the 1.2 and 2 volts we
had previously putting us at one point
two eight seven volts we're also now at
sixty four point six degrees Celsius and
144 watts of power consumption our final
step to 4.0 gigahertz required zero
point one one nine volt on top of the
previous jump putting us at a total of
zero point three three seven over the
initial 3.5 gigahertz requirement of one
point zero six nine moving on to a chart
to help visualize this we now add the
2700 x data points at 3.5 gigahertz the
2700 exa needed just 0.9 volts to hold
stable a significant reduction from the
r7 1700 the 2700 acts required an
increase in voltage to zero point nine
five six to sustain 3.6 gigahertz or a
jump of 0.05 volts and so on until we
eventually hit 4.0 gigahertz at one
point 160 volts for this particular test
run that then required a jump of 0.08
volts to climb to four point one
gigahertz and at this point we switched
to a larger cooler as we were heading 70
degrees and up on TDI which was causing
instability crashes and limitations in
our overclocking for our long term
blender burnin test this means that the
X 62 and flow 360 data is not perfectly
comparable and so is represented by a
dotted line for the 360 you can see that
the curve gets incredibly steep at 4.2
gigahertz
where we had to increase from one point
to four to one point three eight volts
to hold stability with the larger cooler
note that we could achieve this with
lower voltage of tuning B CLK instead
but that's one of our controls here we
can't get into territory of really
vertical increases because we're limited
by temperature there Bauer included a
graph in his 6000 megahertz 2700 x OC
video showing voltages and frequencies
he achieves without
- reformatted to match our own graphs
his data looks like this
his voltages are lower because among
other reasons he's using a higher level
of LLC but the shape of the curve is
close to our own right down to the sharp
increase required at the end of the
chart he went as high as 1.5 volts
without surpassing the four point three
gigahertz he was testing in increments
of 0.025 volts and 0.025 gigahertz so we
can extrapolate a best-case scenario of
achieving four point three to five
gigahertz at one point five to five
volts on the coolant solution he used
with the controls he used you can see
our own voltage curve extrapolation is
similar to his with both hitting a steep
wall at the end that is basically
impossible without sub ambient cooling
again all core overclocking on the 2700
X is sort of unrewarding same thing for
the 2600 X because that X demarcation at
the end means that your base and boost
out of the box are pushed up just high
enough that you don't gain a ton from
overclock in all core unless you go
through and manually to an individual
cores in which case you're doing a lot
more work to bin your cores and you will
get a bit more performance but is it
really worth it it just depends on if
you're doing it because you enjoy that
process or if you're doing it for
performance because if it's the latter
it's a lot of work for the performance
if it's the former have fun because
that's the point anyway so it doesn't
really matter what else it gets you but
the bigger point here is that as stated
previously
Rison 2 is able to sustain same clocks
with rise and 1 at a much lower voltage
but as you push the frequency higher
it's sort of exponential or at least a
nonlinear increase in that you can go
from zero point zero three zero point
zero to increase in voltage to
eventually zero point three increase in
voltage and up which is a big difference
so pretty interesting data from that
standpoint a couple of notes on test
methodology before closing out here I
move this to the end just because people
get bored of things like being accurate
so for methodology our previous test
used both prime and blender but in the
interest of efficiency in these tests we
tested stability by using our most
stressful blender benchmark for about 10
minutes that's enough time to perform
test it's not enough time to guarantee a
stable OC for long up times like 24
hours whatever but strictly for academic
purposes it's enough and we're not going
to 24 hours stress test things like this
because it just it would not be doable
so a plenty for the circumstances we're
looking at for the testing we're doing
there Bauer his chart the numbers we use
there are with Cinebench r15 so we have
different approaches which means
probably our test would be more likely
to fail at a given voltage then his just
because Cinebench is a bit lighter on
the cpu then our blender benchmark which
lasts much longer so good enough for the
purpose of this in terms of other
methodology information we used LLC one
step down from the max level which is
why in the tables especially in the
article below you'll see the input
voltage is different from the measured
voltage at the CPU but that's fine we
present both numbers bios settings and
hardware we kept the same everything
kept the same other than the CPU V Corps
and all core multiplier which were the
various variables being tested and the
4.1 gigahertz tests on the 2700 X we're
done using again the Thermaltake 360
flow for 4.1 and up and that's as
opposed to the two eighty millimeter
kraken x 62 and these are marked with an
asterisk in the tables and a dotted line
of charts so this wasn't a test of how
high the 2700 acts can be overclocked we
can do higher than 4.2 barely but we
were trying to see what could happen
without adjusting things like reference
clock because it's a test of mote
frequency curve not a test of max OC
performance and all core overclock in
any way is is nearing bordering on
pointless these days with how good acts
of r2 is on its own so something to keep
in mind for the x class CPUs or just by
an on x1 and overclock it to an X and
get the same performance for cheaper
anyway that's the Volt frequency curve
