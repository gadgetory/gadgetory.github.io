and match power supply cables but if you
end up with a bin full of assorted power
supply cables then there's a good trick
to figuring out where do they belong
so other than looking at the cable and
trying to go by sight which is a
dangerous proposition the next thing you
can do is use a DMM and you use a cheap
one you don't have to use a high-end one
like this you get one for 30 bucks and
just probe the cable to figure out if
the pinout matches so we're gonna show
you how to do that today now the reason
this is useful is because if you do mix
and match power supply cables as we
showed a couple years ago what can
happen is you'll kill either the part on
the receiving end or you can damage the
power supply depending on how its wired
because wiring is not standardized on
the power supply and so that's what
we're gonna be talking about today
before that this video is brought to you
by thermal grizzly and their high-end
thermal compounds Thermal Grizzly makes
cryo not paste for high thermal
performance and conductivity without
being electrically conductive so you
don't have to worry about shorting
components cryo knot is particularly
good for replacing stock GPU pastes as
cryo knot is a non curing compound learn
more at the link in the description
below so here's the quick version of our
previous video and if you didn't see it
we'll put a card on the screen whichever
corner that goes in you should watch it
but the quick version is the power
supply side of the cabling it's got a
key
of course which just means that the
edges of the pins are chamfered in
different ways so you shouldn't be able
to mix and match it but that doesn't
stop people because these connectors are
pretty available and the manufacturer
will just buy whatever and then match it
but it doesn't mean that if the key fits
the pin in that key has to be the same
you might have a 12 volt line where
normally there's a 5 or you might have a
12 where there's a ground which is bad
or you might have a 12 where there's a
blank and so you can't mix and match
power supply cables typically because
the trouble is you might kill it for
example if you mix SATA cable in from a
pic tube fenders from like a coarser
power supply onto an EVGA one or
something it could kill the SSD or it
can kill the rest of the system who
makes a different cable so that's that
that's the concern
the good news is if you really need an
extra for example CPU cable like I did
for one of our C sonic power supplies
and you only have one that you can find
you can start testing your bin of extra
cables and try and figure out if any of
them will fit it's possible because the
power supply manufacturers are all using
the same couple of suppliers see sonic
being one of them it's possible that of
three different vendors like EVGA
Corsair NZXT whomever if three different
manufacturers use C Sonic for their
supplier see Sonic might have used the
same pin out for each vendor now that's
not always the case it is not a safe
assumption but it's something that gives
you somewhere to start if you have
different power supplies you can probe
the cable and just do a simple
continuity test to see is it continuous
from the top left to the bottom left on
the other end and then does the other
cable match that and if all the pins
match then it's safe to mix them as long
as the key also fits of course so that's
we're going to show you I've got a see
Sonic prime cable here this is a CPU
cable as an EPS 12 volt cable we have
another C Sonic prime power supply and
what we're gonna do is just test that
cable from the other C Sonic prime it's
an older model and see if it's
compatible with the power supply this
came off of because I'm missing a CPU
cable for that one so we're just gonna
try and see between this between the
other C Sonic power supply can we find a
cable that'll fit this key and that has
the same wiring internally so this is
the other test bench we've got a C Sonic
power supply on this one it's it's the
same model but a different year of the
model so we need another EPS 12-volt
cable and I've got two hanging out of
here so I can just pull one of these and
then we're just gonna label this to make
sure it doesn't get mixed in with the
other one during testing and then we can
test it so here's what you need to do
first for the other cable that you pull
out of a known power supply or something
like that we've labeled it just so it
doesn't accidentally get mixed with this
one and then kill a test system so we
have our two cables the key is the first
they need to check so if the key matches
the key is just the actually we can show
it easier on the mod mat over here so
this is a PCIe pen this is an EPS 12
volt and one side is standardized that
would be the side that connects to the
device the side that connects to the
power supply is not standardized for
various reasons which we've discussed
previously but that's the key you know
you see the chamfered engine edges there
you see a square square chamfered edges
and that's how you can figure out if
it's going to fit of course and if we
match these two cables the key is in
fact the same so it's a square square
diagonal diagonal square square diagonal
diagonal and then the same on the other
side so these are actually compatible in
so far as you could plug them both into
the same unit that doesn't mean the
wiring is compatible first sign of a
problem the font is different so we know
that it comes from a different power
supply model or year and so now we need
to definitely check to see if it works
you can use a cheap multimeter for this
we're just going to use a a resistance
check so it's a continuity test and this
is pretty easy to do we're also going to
drought a diagram and draw the pin out
on a paper so that we can figure out
where everything belongs so this we're
gonna connect one to ground and one over
here for resistance test in okay so
let's do a diagram just so I can keep
track of everything
okay so the pin numbers I wrote here
there is an official pin number spec I
did not follow that I just wrote them
down so I could track what's why and
what we're gonna do is is how you do you
plug in your multimeter get it set up
and you just pick a cable and figure out
where does it go
so we know it doesn't matter which end
we're gonna stick one end in here on the
power supply side of the 1300 watt C
sonic power supplies cable so over here
you'll see 0 L this just means that
there's no continuity nothing's
connected right now we're not even
probed anywhere and what we're looking
for is basically 0.0 0.1 0.2 you
something like that so let's just check
the cables we've got the power supply
and let me orient this like my drawing
so that would be like that and then
we're gonna go with the pin number 4 as
I wrote it out so we're checking that
pin we're gonna check the top right
which would also be my pin number 4 over
here 0 L so these are not continuous so
those aren't connected not continuous
continuous so so if you see a number
growing out of control that is not what
we want we want is that right there zero
point 2 so that's gonna be my pin number
4 versus my pin number 6 which I'm
saying mine there because I do not
follow spec for this so what we know is
PIN forks nice - pin 6 on this one
but we don't know and you can check the
manual for this but we don't know what
that is right now you could check I
guess the the system side and see what
is that cable and that is actually a
ground right there on the system side so
we do I guess we know what that is by
way of looking at the spec for the
system end so now it's test number three
okay bottom left so that would be my
opinion here here is one that is the
it's a colored cable which we actually
prefer although some people call them
ketchup and mustard and don't like them
they're useful because you can see
what's actually what so the power supply
end over here you can see there's a clip
the clip aligns with my drawing like
that and that would leave all of the
bottom row is ground all the top row is
12 volt so just to prove a point how
this works here's the cable that goes to
the power supply when we did finally
find the correct cable for the PSU and
this is an important note so these don't
have to match perfectly each time as
long as on this cable we only have a 12
volt in the ground so as long as all the
12 volt goes to only 12 volt on the
system side and all the ground only goes
to ground then that's all that really
matters so if you test the system side
here in theory pin 7 should correspond
with pen 2 based on our previous diagram
and in fact it does not which would lead
you to believe that oh this is the
incorrect cable but as long as pin 2
goes to another pin on the bottom row so
that could be 5 6 or 8 in our diagram
and I just let go for a second so
there's 7 by our diagram 5 6 8 this
bottom row is all ground top rows all 12
volts so those don't match let's try
maybe pin 6
is pintu and those are continuous so
that would be 12 volt to 12 volt so
that's fine we can still use this cable
let's just make sure that remains true
so it stabs pin 1 which should
originally it went to pin 8 so it went
to 12 volt so it's test pin 1 versus 1/8
and those are continuous this time so
we're still good let's test we only need
to test through 2 more so a pin 2 or a 3
rather pin 3 vs. pin 5 not continuous
pin 6 our last hope here yes because 2
already went to 6 right so that connects
to 7 so all the 12 volts so far is 12
volt we have one more to check that
would be pin for as long as it matches
something on the bottom yep 4 goes to 5
so what we've learned then the pin out
is different on this cable even though
it should come from the same exact power
supply but 12 volt only ever goes to 12
volt ground only ever goes to ground
which we know because of the the pin out
diagram on the mod mat which if you want
to buy that because you think can be
useful it's on stored I Cameron's axis
net to pick up the mod mod I'm working
out here so the pin out match is in so
far as the the voltage is go to the
right play the rails go to the right
place so you 12 volts 12 ground to
ground the pin itself is not exactly the
same but the key is the same so we can
use this power supply cable with this
power spike cable even if they come from
different units although I believe these
two came from the same one they just got
mixed up in the jumble of other cables
so that's that's good way to check your
pin out and cable compatibility so
there's a pretty easy way to validate if
a cable from a pile of cables will match
the power supply you're trying to find a
cable for as noted it's really it's not
about the pin out or the the wire path
being exactly the same pin one doesn't
need to go to pin 7 in this EPS 12 volt
diagram we did it just needs to go to 5
6 7 or 8 and then as long as the rest of
the pins follow that same path where all
the 12 vote goes to only 12 volts in an
EPS or a little cable and all the ground
only goes to ground then you're fine you
can use the cables assuming the keys
match and then the same idea applies for
other cables
keep in mind that you might have a
5-volt line in there as well you might
have a blank like this one has two
blanks in it because it's a six pin
header and it's only going to 4-pin
molex so just make sure they match and
you'll be good to go we have used this
method in the past to find cables that
got lost in just a pile and we need to
match them back to their source power
supply and we've also used it in the
past to mix and match power supply
cables safely from different power
supplies as long as the headers don't
match because again it's the same
suppliers for all the manufacturers so
that's it for this one thanks for
watching as always go to store it I
Karen's Nexus net to pick up a shirt
like this one which will be out soon as
an out of stock and not available ever
again and then the mod mat that we used
is also on the store or you go to
