Justin we're gonna be talking about the
cooling and Power Solutions for the new
r-tx 2000 series cards already talked
with Tom Peterson so if you want some of
the content on overclocking and
frequency response be sure to check that
video so for today let's let's start
with the cooling solution I guess the
cooling is the first time that I
remember anyway that Nvidia has done an
on blower card for reference so let's
let's go through some of the basics here
I guess before that this video is
brought to you by the thermal take level
20 VT micro ATX case the level 20 VT
takes the high quality at level 20
design and makes it more affordable and
shrinks it down to a micro ATX form
factor at that with fully modular
paneling it's possible to rearrange this
case into whatever configuration you
prefer for a micro ATX case that can be
a discussion piece in a home theater
system click the link in the description
below you've got a dual axial solution
you want to walk through some of the top
level changes other than that yeah for
sure you know we're really excited about
our new coolant solution for the r-tx 20
series you know it's the first time
we've done a Founders edition with a
dual axial cooling solution and in fact
it's the first time ever that a vapor
chambers been paired with a dual axial
coolant solution and it provides really
an incredible amount of cooling
performance you know when you compare to
our previous generation the the GTX 1080
founders Edition you know you see
temperatures running it like 20 degrees
or so lower you'll see acoustics at you
know up to one one-fifth quieter one
fifth of the noise compared to the
previous generation so really some
pretty significant improvements and and
really the key is that we've combined
the dual axial fan with the vapor
chamber for the first time ever in a
graphics card right so that was my first
question about it is the vapor chamber
completely or mostly obstructs the PCB
so then how do you go about dealing with
the fact that air can't really get
through the vapor chamber to the prm's
what's what's connecting the via rammus
to the rest of the cooler yeah so under
so we have a base plate that sits on top
of the VRMs that's thermally connected
to them and in that base plate we have a
heat pipe so the heat from the VRMs
is thermally connected into that
baseplate it spreads out through that
heat pipe and can be exhausted out of
the system so then for the base plate
and the fin stack are those soldered
together is that they're all pads what's
what's the connection so the vapor
chamber is soldered on to the fence deck
so it's got great thermal connection
there and that vapor chamber does a
great job of just spreading out the heat
throughout really evenly throughout the
whole fence stack because really the key
to the performance of the thermal
solution is to be able to get the heat
which is concentrating the GPU really
effectively and efficiently spread
throughout all the fins so that when the
air blows down on it you're really doing
a great job of getting more air over
more of the heated area and be able to
remove it from the fans and I guess I'll
pitch this one out there to for the fans
so I noticed and I don't we didn't talk
about this before but I notice that the
fans are slightly more spaced than some
of the partner solutions so in the past
partner solutions the duel fans had to
be fairly close together sometimes
because it's larger sometimes they just
do it that way is there any specific
reasoning for the space you know I mean
did you just optimize for where the vrm
and the GPU are basically just optimize
for the solution for the GPU and for the
entire layout you know one of the other
relatively new things that we did on the
fan is that these are not these are 13
blade fans we added some more blades to
that and again that gives you more
airflow at a lower rpm for for better
airflow it and with less noise right so
Cheetham let's go on to the power stuff
so for first immediate question what are
we looking at for phase design I mean
we've got core in memory what can you
walk me through for the TI models and
the non TI okay so we have the most
number of phases ever on a founders
edition design and we did that to be
able to really be able to lean into
overclocking and give everyone a
wonderful overclocking experience and
the best efficiency ever on Founders
Edition card and so with the TI we have
13 phases of core 3 phases of memory for
the non TI 80 have 8 phases of core 2
phases of memory and for the 70 class
card we have six phases of core and two
phases of memory and all of this put
together with
the dynamic phase shed technology allows
us to be efficient throughout the power
draw range so even when you're just
having it plugged in and you're doing
something like gaming on the web or
something that's less taxing it's gonna
be super efficient in your system so
let's let's break down that word dynamic
phase technology that you're working on
now I start on the presentation the
viewers haven't seen it yet what can you
walk us through that yeah so when the
power supply's of these switching power
supplies how they work is they turn on
and off really quick to shunt the
current to the GPU and when you have a
lot of switching at very low current
draw then all of that energy is being
burned during the switching process so
the more phases you have the less
efficient you are at low power at high
power you're actually going to spend
most of the time in the conduction mode
and so you're you want to be have more
phases to can have less conduction loss
and so what we're doing is as the power
goes down when you use when you're
running a lower power workload you turn
off phases that you don't need and you
reduce the amount of switching loss
right and one of the other things we saw
in the presentation is there's is it 60
watts of overclocking overhead or
something like there's additional power
overhead from Pascal yeah there is
definitely more power overhead from
Pascal I'm sorry power overclocking
overhead from Pascal not only is there
it is that coming from the phase
additional phases which provides more
current it also comes from the fact that
we've provided bigger input connectors
than we really needed to and we have
this advanced current monitoring
technology and you'll be able to see the
current monitors on the board you've
done a great board analysis before I
love those things they're random so so
yeah the current monitoring allows us to
really dial in the current to make sure
that everything is cool and and just
wonderful for overclocking in the card
so for other stuff here you went through
the phase design phase count on that are
there any we were talking about the
power balancing power monitoring is it
true I heard that there is some more
power balancing between the two power
headers on the boards is that accurate
yeah I don't know how you found that out
but thank you for calling it out go
ahead
free advertising um yeah so there is we
have new power balancing technology as
well because each phase is around 30
watts it can be about 30 watts and and
if you try to try to draw it from one
connector or another connector depending
on how the GPU is pulling power from the
phases you might not be able to fully
utilize all the current available on a
particular input connector so we have
this really high precision power
balancing capability now that really
improves the amount of it well we've had
power balancing in the past but this is
much faster and much more accurate so
we're able to fully utilize the inputs
available input power my last question
for you back to the phase count so
whenever we hear is only like twelve
phase the instant assumption is it's
doubled or is two PW PWM signal split
between two fats or something like that
are you guys doubling at all what's
what's the what's the approach to 13
phase or 8 phase designs on these yeah
so we have an all new power controller
for for these cards and they're able to
drive with just a lot more phases power
doublers take up real estate on the PCB
our phased uploads really take up real
estate that we didn't want to spend we
wanted to spend as much of that real
estate and putting down fats and making
it super efficient and in fact we also
spent a bunch of space if you'll notice
in the founders Edition on twice it's
nearly twice as many capacitors and so
that makes is the supplies ultra quiet
and that actually also helps power
efficiency so we wanted to spend the
beat the board area that way instead of
putting down like phase doublers and
other things that we could have done and
it's it's just not gonna as you pass
current through the PCB it's less
efficient as well so makes a lot of
sense so for more information as always
