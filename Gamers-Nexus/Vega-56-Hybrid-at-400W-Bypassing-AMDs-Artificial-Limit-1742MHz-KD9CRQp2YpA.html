don't care about power consumption when
it comes to Vega that's all we heard
about in the reviews well here's Vega
modified for people who don't care about
power consumption in the live stream
testing this card we were pushing
something like 406 Watts through it it
is a Vega 56 card for a reminder that
was cap out at about 300 to 308 watts
with the bios a lock and 50% offset from
AMD
so we've fixed it we can now push as
much power as we want enough to kill the
card really and we'll see how far it
goes with the liquid cooled mod 360
millimeter thermal take flow radiator on
it and a whole bunch of fans before that
we partnered with LastPass to bring you
this video LastPass is a password
manager that helps generate random
passwords for each account insuring
unique passwords for every log in as
fast strengthens account security so
that you're no longer using the same
password for multiple sites
learn more at the link below for a quick
recap on the mod what we have here is
the flow cooler it's 360 millimeters we
have to Corsair Maglev fans and one
Noctua and f12 fan because those are the
three best fans that I had easily
available and the FETs
most of them are cooled by well a direct
airflow fan above them along with some
heatsink so just aluminum heatsink
sticking off the fins are from Arctic
Cooling's kits that we've basically
adapted to this and then for the actual
mounting we bought some screws at a
local hardware store and drilled holes
in a mounting plate for our Vega
frontier edition hybrid mod and then
repurposed all of that here so it's
working out pretty well now the thing is
this is it's it's not really direct
comparison anymore because we've also
installed power play tables which is a
registry hack that builds oyk provided
to us with the help of I believe helm
from the overclocking forums he was on
so that allows us to do up to 242
percent offset which is enough to kill
the card if the card actually pulls that
much it's kind of hard to get it to pull
more than 31 apps but actually we did 33
lets go anyway so it's not direct
comparison anymore
the amount of fans we have on this thing
plus the overhead
and cooling the FETs means that there's
zero point to testing noise levels you
could get it to be fairly quiet and
actually cool well but then you're not
gonna be doing the crazy overclocking
stuff so it's a trade-off this isn't for
people who care about noise or power
because in the comment sections of most
reviews you see people say I don't care
about noise or power I just want
something that performance well this is
your unrestrained version of vagin 56 it
should outperform Vegas 64 stock for
sure we'll see how it does a overclocked
in a future content piece but we'll look
at all that today let's start with the
power and thermals is the most important
and then move into gaming performance
some 3d mark stuff things like that
given all the uncertainty surrounding
the initial driver launch and limited
voltage and broken clock reporting
functionality we first needed to check
whether the power play tables were
actually doing anything fortunately the
clock reporting was fixed in driver 17 8
1 onward something we showed in our last
livestream with hybrid 56 so we now need
to isolate the power target here's a
look at the frequency versus the power
target represented by PCIe power draw
through the cables I was measured by a
current clamp power consumption starts
off in the 296 to 300 watt area when we
have a 50% offset which was the max
permitted by Andy originally that's a
bit below what we saw on the reference
Vega 56 card which was 308 watts so
we've reduced maybe power leakage or
something by about 4% giving us some
more Headroom but not really enough to
do anything with regardless that's the
starting point the clock bounces around
sporadically at this point jumping
between 1474 and 1702 megahertz because
the cards power consumption is limited
to about 300 watts we can't achieve
stability at higher clocks without
pushing power we first go to 60% power
off set permitted by the power play
tables which gets us another 16 watts to
work with the clock still aren't stable
so we moved to 70% power around the 240
second mark on the chart that boosts us
33 watts over the original 50% offset
and has a clear impact on helping that
somewhat stabilize the frequency at 80%
power we start pushing 350 watts through
the PCIe cables which largely stabilizes
the 1702 megahertz target the next
attempt is 17 22 which proves unstable
and requires a jump to 90% power we were
not able to
anywhere close to this with the original
reference card this puts us at 362 365
watts
17:32 megahertz is roughly stable at the
same power draw
and finally for 1740 2 megahertz we
boost a 95% power to fully stabilized
and draw 370 to 380 watts down the PCIe
cables plus whatever smaller amount is
coming through the PCIe slot which
largely powers the memory
the result is 70 to 80 watts more than
the reference card with the clock that
stabilizes at 1742 megahertz rather than
going between 1474 and 17:02 with our
original target and we started crashing
at 1762 megahertz so definitely up
against stability there even in the live
stream when we pushed 406 watts more
than we did here because we were just
trying to get the highest power and
frequency as we could at the most stable
setting we could even then we couldn't
get really beyond 17 whatever 1742 17 22
so 17 42 is the final number for fire
strike for the games later on we have to
drop down to 17 32 because 1740 Caesar
is not stable as for HB m 2 it stays at
980 megahertz because that was the most
stable there was some test like fire
strike we were able to complete with 990
megahertz and here's the temperature
response to all of that core temperature
paintin's 28 C quickly maxing out at 31
C this is not a delta T over ambient
reading it's just really low ambient is
about 24 Celsius here but we know now
that our Vega 56 under reports at the
temperature by at least a few degrees so
it's either just inaccurate like a lot
of thermal sensors are but more than
normally or it's confused about the
temperature we can't be sure by how much
unfortunately either way we're about 40
to 45 C below the reported temperature
on the air-cooled version the MOSFET
temperatures max out at 46 C for the
middle right fat 32 C for the top fat
both of which were cooled by direct
airflow from a fan for perspective the
reference card had fed temperatures of
about 63 C for the right FET and 73 C
for the top FET we've managed to reduce
MOSFET temperatures by blasting them
with air despite these 70 to 80 watts of
extra power to the core so they're
actually cooler than previously but
dealing with a lot more power getting
it's a comparative thermals with another
test we see the RX Vega 56
reference card operates close to the 75
Celsius target with our hybrid
moderating a 25 Celsius GP diode
temperature overclocked into 17 42
megahertz core and 9 80 megahertz HBM 2
and using a 105 percent power target we
pushed 30 Celsius T V diode temperature
but note here that ambient temperature
again is 23 to 24 so we do still have
that same inaccuracy as previously
mentioned under idle workloads we're
just to kind of illustrate this sitting
between 2 and 4 Celsius below ambient
which obviously isn't possible with this
kind of cooling setup you need something
chilled to actually achieve that
so the temperature reporting is
definitely incorrect looking at power
consumption at the wall our RX Vega 56
hybrid system pushes for 65 watts when
overclocked 1742 my card score and nine
80 megahertz HP m2 that's an increase of
165 watts over the reference vega card
this chart will be quick this is what we
use when doing our initial undervolt in
testing that sporadic orange line is
from fighting with the software back
then and shows our range of PCIe
consumption being roughly 180 to 355
watts we were able to wrangle the hybrid
down to 355 in this particular task by
dropping to a 95% power target which
proved stable for a fire strike though
ultimately increased it a bit for gaming
keep in mind that power consumption
varies based on scene and benchmark use
so you'll see different results based on
which tests were actively showing for
some quick power numbers from fire
strike as measured at the wall and again
we're switching back to wall draw here
we see total system power at 447 watts
for the hybrid ocv 56 nearly tie-in it
with the crossfire rx 580 and 480 cards
the stock Vega 64 system draws 372 watts
so we've got a 75 watt increase here and
the stock v56 system drops 303 watts a
gtx 980ti system draws 347 watts or 100
watts at less than our b56 hybrid OC and
about 40 more than the reference v56
card there'll be more of these power
charts in the article along with the
fire strike benchmark scores as for
gaming results we'll start with the more
exciting ones then work our way toward
the disappointing outcomes
this also means starting with games that
tend to be favored toward AMD
Sniper Elite 4 has a few relevant
the stock rx Vega 56 card operated an
average FPS of 53 with a 9% overclock
and 9 50 megahertz
HBM to clock and in us at 58 FPS average
that's an increase of nine and a half
percent and is largely from the boosted
power limit and HBM - as we learned in
previous content the core overclock and
is a lot less relevant than HP m2 and
power offsets a hybrid card clocked to
17 32 megahertz and 980 for stability
and at 66 FPS average with its 100%
power target ensure we're pushing 30
amps down the PCIe cables for 80 Watts
more power consumption but we're not
concerned about power consumption today
because that's what people keep saying
the gain is 13.8% over the overclock sat
Vega 56 card or 25% over the stock
making 56 card compared to the stock
Vega 64 card where 14.8% ahead in
performance note also that vega 64 is
basically tied technically behind the
overclocked reference at vega 56 which
is sort of further reinstating vega 64
spore value just get vega 56 and
overclock it is the lesson here even
with a and these BIOS locks and other
limitations we're doing better than the
stock 64 we have an overclock to Vega 64
yet but that'll come sometime after pax
west looking to Nvidia cards the v56
hybrid OC is now a bit ahead of the GT X
1080 reference card without an overclock
we haven't yet gotten around to
overclock in the 1080 for this new round
of test so keep that in mind but in the
very least we're ahead of the reference
card which is pretty damn good for a
Vega 56 granted we had the bypass
restrictions put in place by AMD but it
worked out after the singularity testing
lands our stock rx Vega 56 blower card
at 67 FPS average with the overclocked
reference card as howdy to FPS a gain of
7.5% Vega 64 runs 8.5% faster and our
Vega 56 hybrid runs 7% faster than that
83 FPS average the hybrid model is now
16% ahead of the overclocked Vega at 56
reference card and 24 percent of the
full stock card this lands the
overclocked hybrid 56 ahead of the
reference again stock clocked GTX 1084
honor shows surprisingly positive
scaling for this overclocked at 4k we
moved from a 38 FPS average to 44 FPS
average over
clocks on reference that ties up Vega 56
with the 64 showing once again that see
use matter a lot less than clock speed
on and these architectures the hybrid OC
gets up to 51 FPS average again of 16.5%
over the overclocked reference 56 and
now surpasses a stock clocked reference
1080 again with how close these cards
are note that a partner model 1080 would
out match the hybrid OC 56 but still
it's an admirable jump if we're roughly
tied with partner models that's not a
bad place to be for a 56 granted it's at
two times the power consumption but
that's the cost to have the power play
table mods for folks who don't care
about power at 1440p we're at 98 FPS
average over the hybrid OC which is a
gain of 11 percent over the overclocked
reference card and the Vegas 64 add
stock clocks the 31 percent gain scene
is over the Vega 56 reference card with
no overclocked and is again impressive
we're at way higher power consumption
once again but have boosted performance
greatly
1080p post similar results we've gained
8 percent over the overclocked reference
card which is getting much less exciting
so we'll move on brace yourselves to the
next one Ghost Recon wildlands at 4k
positions us at 32 FPS average for the
stock card 39 erage for the 50 percent
offset and 41 FPS for the overclocked
reference card by 9 percent 9 50
megahertz HP m2 with the 50 percent
offset compared to the power offset that
overclocked does almost nothing the
hybrid OC doesn't do much either as we
gain just over 5 FPS versus the 50
percent offset with a stock card so it's
not at all worth the power consumption
or the time in this instance 1440p is
next to Vega 56 reference around 67 FPS
average and the 50 percent offset is at
65 FPS average have 14% improvement just
from the offset but the overclock and
the 50 percent offset get us only an
extra 3% disappointingly a hybrid OSI
model entities which is another couple
percentage points gain so not all
exciting 1080p follows this trend and
scaling nearly exactly so we'll skip it
he'll play does last 10 is our least
populated chart we only just started
testing this game so excuse the lack of
data let's just focus on Vega 56 is
scaling for now at 4k the reference 56
operates at 27 fps
boost 34 with the reference OC a hybrid
OC gets us to 37 FPS average both for
massive gains even with the reference
overclock and over power we're doing
pretty well we were clearly starved for
power and clocks in the reference
testing we're not sure what specific
piece of hardware in the GPU caused the
choke point at 4k but the overclock and
over power helps significantly in
addressing it 1440p scales a lot less
impressively but there's also less
ground to gain the hybrid OC card puts a
71 FPS average outperforming the
overclocked reference card by 8% and the
stock card by 13% again an 8% gain is
hard to get excited about particularly
given all the effort and power that went
into the card so that's it that's the
Vega hybrid card the 56 if you takeaways
here one compute units are a lot less
important than just frequency if your
option is vacant 56 overclocked or Vega
64 stock you might as well just go with
Vega 56 even if you're considering
overclock in 64 these cards are gonna
cap out at roughly the same area anyway
so end of the day 56 remains the way
better buy from Andy 64 just it doesn't
really have a place in the market
156 does so damn well by comparison just
a 50% offset and 5 minutes of
overclocking without any of this stuff
all the cables and mods and registry
edits without any of that you can still
achieve Vega 64 performance if not
slightly outperform it so I guess the
takeaway is Vega 56 looks pretty good
once you start doing all this stuff to
it especially pricing notwithstanding
we're ignoring the pricing right now
altogether because it's it's too hard to
follow frankly so what we've got at the
end of the day is a unit that does now
17 32 to 17 42 megahertz on the core 980
on the HBM to stable anyway with power
that's 70 to 80 watts higher than it was
with the 50% offset and performance
that's at times completely not worth it
at all as in like a couple percentage
points to actually really good at 16% in
a couple of the cases of the games that
tend to favor Andy and show those
responses to the clock changes so just
what you're doing I don't know this
might not be something I'd recommend the
powerplay tables are not something you
should mess with you shouldn't mess with
the anything that takes the card out of
a stock state in terms of power delivery
unless you know how much power the vrm
can take and we have it in theory build
Zoids vrm analysis of the vega frontier
edition kind of addresses all that stuff
if you'd like to watch it and learn more
about how much power can go through the
thing but you still take risk when
you're pushing a hundred percent offset
power through the card so keep that in
mind we did pretty well though it's just
for 24/7 use or for actual user
placement and gaming rather than
benchmarking it's probably less
advisable but that's totally up to you
