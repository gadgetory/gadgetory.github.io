hardware news recap for the last week in
hardware news we're talking about
HBM two updates in the production
schedule by Samsung today along with
some additional news items on the Andy
thread River risin boxes that were shown
not really much to say there other than
show them she's fine she jumped pen ha
and the we've got news on a possible
courser acquisition that was discussed a
lot last week hasn't really gotten any
new updates since then we'll be talking
new SSDs gigabytes merging of their
graphics and motherboard divisions and a
couple of miscellaneous news items
before that this is brought to you by
EVGA s at CLC 280 liquid cooler for CPUs
which we previously benchmarked and
found to be a high performer given its
relative silence the temperature output
learn more about this $140 cooler at the
link in the description below
the first major news item is Samsung to
HBM to production it looks like the
boost in production for 2018 so by the
first half of 2018
Samsung is anticipating that more than
50% of its HP m2 production in total
will be moving to the new 8 gigabyte HBM
2 stacks so that will one be useful for
what and these needs are and - it's just
a shift in general global market as
people are moving towards more
utilization of HBM - on the front of
gigabyte and their merger of the
graphics and motherboard divisions
gigabyte shipped about 1 million fewer
motherboards in 2016 and 2015 900,000 to
be exact and that number along with just
changes in the business units in general
means that the company is now merging
its graphics and motherboard divisions
asp overall is higher and revenue hiked
up despite the 900 thousand fewer
motherboard shipments in 2016 but the
company is merging the divisions
regardless and will be keeping the Auris
of branding continuing on as a consumer
targeted brand for gaming products this
means you should expect more of the ors
branding on motherboards and on video
cards this next one is pretty
straightforward and there's not really a
lot to say
Andy posted their box and box art for
these Red River processors on Twitter
that's all there is to say you can look
it's you're curious but we know what
it's going to ship in we don't know
anything else about the box or anything
like that but they're definitely at
least going but somewhat back to the old
tins if anyone remembers those the tins
from the processor is prior to the
high-end FX series we're part of the
branding and the image of those high-end
CPUs so looks like they're at least
moving back towards that direction with
thread Ripper which makes sense for a
higher end product but of course it is
more money spent on packaging that's
just the trade you start to make though
as an enthusiast when you buy high-end
stuff the next part there's a possible
Corsair semi acquisition we don't know
the full details yet this was initially
reported by Reuters techpowerup followed
up and got some not fully validated or
disclosed sources to talk further about
what's going on but basically a Reuters
said that coursers in talks with a
company called Eagle tree capital and
they are looking at a possible
acquisition some in more than five
hundred million dollars the initial
report suggested that Corsair would be
entirely purchased by Eagle tree capital
but in follow up reporting done by
techpowerup with their sources it seems
that only the shares are owned by the
Fransisco partners who currently hold
the shares in Corsair would be the part
that's up for sale to Eagle tree capital
so fransisco partners currently holds a
seventy five million dollar stake in the
company at least at the time they bought
it
one would assume that Eagles you would
pay more for that stake because the
company has grown in value since that
initial purchase and this is allegedly
the only part of the company that's up
for sale so it wouldn't be a full sale
and it looks like the the current
leadership would remain as is but we
don't know any further details so as
usual full grain of salt or shaker of
salt in this case or bucket of salt with
the news but that's kind of what's been
floating around in rumors in the last
week and the SSD news Seagate is
returning to the SSD market with a new
low-cost series of SSDs the Nitro one
for one series will offer six models all
SATA base and using TLC and the lowest
cost to capacity ratio is in the 256
gigabyte models and is currently looking
to be signed for 80
five dollars other capacities offered
include 240 480 512 960 and 1024
gigabytes or 1 terabyte all drives are
in the 2.5 inch form factor offer up to
300 terabytes of total bytes written and
a 1.5 million MTBF rating Seagate has
the six models with the marketed between
performance endurance and
cost-competitive capacities all drives
come with a five-year warranty Western
Digital blue series and SanDisk's ultra
series of SSDs are also seen an update
to the 3d BICS flash and will offer
higher capacities up to one terabyte for
Western Digital blue and 2 terabytes for
SanDisk Ultra the new drives are said to
be shipping but it is not known when
retailers or if they have already will
be receiving the new stock both the WD
blue and SanDisk Ultra use identical
hardware 64 layered TLT provided by
SanDisk and a Marvel 88 SS 1034
controller the WD blue units will be
offered in both 2.5 inch and m dot 2
options and SanDisk looks to only offer
a 2.5 inch configuration as before both
series of drives will operate via the
SATA 6 gigabits per second interface
prices for the Refresh WD blue and
SanDisk Ultra start at $90 and $100
respectively with the craze surrounding
m dot 2 cooling lately we can't seem to
escape another company shipping another
m2 cooler each week alpha cool is now
adding 2 more to the mix so we've got
the HDX 3 + H DX to the HDX 2 is a
passive solution it will support 80
millimeter form factor m2 devices on a
PCIe expansion card and then the HDX 3
will use a nickel plated copper water
block and standard G quarter inch
threaded fittings for its cooling so it
fits into an open-loop HDX to is using a
large aluminum heatsink and then just
passive operation we need to look into
this more because it seems people keep
pushing these heat sinks and as we've
said in the past you really just kind of
want to cool the controller and leave
everything else alone so it'll be
interesting to see if endurance is
hindered in any meaning
away by cooling the flash with liquid
because that really brings temperatures
down a lot more than what they would be
designed to operate at and with flash
cooler isn't better with controllers
that is the case though
but either way also cools got some new
lambda 2 SS the equal is coming out in
miscellaneous news Arctic cooling is
preparing for thread Ripper and they're
priming their line of liquid freezer AOS
for the tr4 socket the liquid freezer
line of coolers all use a 12-volt water
pump cover cold plates and radiators and
sizes of 360 240 and 120 millimeters all
radios come equipped with Arctic
Cooling's f12 120 millimeter fanned the
liquid freezer 360 offers a TDP of 300
watts
while the 240 and 120 versions
opportunity P is of 250 watts presently
the liquid freezer 360 sells for $140
the 240 for $100 and 120 for $86 if you
ever needed 16 fan headers on a
motherboard Asus I suppose has you
covered going forward the rog crosshair
6 extreme is ACS's next line of x 370
motherboards for the rise in CPUs this
is not for thread ref remind you and the
base unit of the crosshair 6 extreme
includes 13 fan headers on the board
they have an expansion card that gives
you another three fitting the total up
to 16 if you really needed that the
board is also targeted pretty much
entirely at overclocking enthusiasts and
water cooling enthusiasts additionally
it's got addressable LEDs and an RGB
header 2 reinforced PCIe x16 slots which
these days is kind of standard now and
then the onboard inner 2.11 AC Wi-Fi
with bluetooth support as well so that
board is coming out at a price of about
$350 starting in August just after the
thread Ripper release Corsair introduced
the new rmx white series extending a
white hue to the company's RM 850 X 8 to
the watch and 750 watt power supplies
the PSU is our 80 plus gold certified
fully modular and come with a 135
millimeter rifle bearing fan
additionally the PSU to offer heavy duty
productions as expected the mtbf is
rated at 100,000
hours and there's a 10-year warranty
attached the rmx white series will come
with cable to individually sleeved with
paracord and an assortment of cable
combs the rmx y2 is 850 X is $170 while
the servitude DX is $150 then as a final
note this one is game news not hardware
news but interesting to pay attention to
given that the Starcraft remake is in
the mix Blizzard as of this past week
laid off its composer Russell Brauer
best known for work in World of Warcraft
Starcraft 2 overwatch the Diablo series
and basically everything that they've
worked on he announced via Facebook that
he'd been laid off and said that his job
was eliminated as part of a sounded
decentralization initiative had to check
my notes to make sure I got the
corporate BS correct so a Blizzard has
undertaken that initiative and as such
as eliminated the job of composer for
their main composers they've had for a
while now and that it looks like he'll
be doing freelance work for them in the
future but that's probably the last
we'll see of Russell brower's current
full-time role at Blizzard so
interesting news to make note of other
than that check the article in the
