Computex 2018 we had a couple of
requests via Twitter for this
this is OC robot so EVGA has an update
coming for BIOS 4x 299 dark motherboards
probably in July and a couple of the
things are doing include Auto
overclocking and then they've also just
got a complete overhaul of the interface
in general before that this video is
brought to you by the cable mod vertical
GPU adapter a universal kit that lets
you add a vertical GPU mount to almost
any enclosure the vertical GPU adapts
our positions video cards further back
from the glass than most stock vertical
GPU mounts aiding in thermals and also
easily sockets into the PCIe expansions
lots of compatible cases the after kit
is brand new and makes it easy to show
off video cards even in cases that don't
include a stock vertical GPU mount
learn more at the link in the
description below so for the main thing
here what we have on screen right now is
I just let it run an auto see I'll show
you how it works in a moment and the end
result was the thin just kind of stress
tested in BIOS without having to reboot
into Windows stress tested itself with
something I'm told is similar to prime95
maybe FFTs or something like that and
all we're doing is stressing the CPU so
it's pushing frequency voltage and
checking against temperature so the end
result this is a 280 C LC for reference
literally that's the name of the product
from EVGA and 4.5 gigahertz at one point
two seven three volts is actually not
too bad the temperature is going to be
the main limiter here so as you
progressively increase your cooler size
or capacity it will change the frequency
and voltage at which you can run a
stable overclock depending on what's
looked up in a massive matrix so it's
all kind of a huge lookup table that
will step up the frequency to the max
stable frequency and then try to step
down the voltage to the minimum stable
voltage without crashes which is just
where you want to be so typically
speaking this kind of thing is going to
be not quite as good as a manual
overclock but if you can get pretty
close to a manual overclock it's a good
way to get a starting point before you
do fine tuning on on your own one note
here though this is a bit different from
some of the auto overclock buttons we've
seen on other motherboards where it's
basically a lookup table with maybe
three or four settings and that's kind
of it so I'm looking forward to testing
this
zhan sometime soon because it does look
promising the other items here so under
the extras tab you drop it down if you
don't want to do the OC robot setup and
you want to actually overclock it
yourself you can still do that except
when you drop down it's got a built-in
stress test the same this uses so as you
continue working on fine-tuning your own
overclock manually be able to do in BIOS
stress tests which if it works just as
well as prime then that's great because
it saves a ton of time rebooting into
Windows each time if it goes unstable
even freezes in BIOS it's a quick
restart to get back into BIOS so that's
the July BIOS update for EVGA dark
motherboards as you can see the entire
interface also changed a bit but the
options should remain the same other
than OC Robo auto OC and the over other
overclocking stress testing features we
talked about UJ also has an ex 299 dark
mini micro ATX motherboard excuse me so
we'll have some information on that some
b-roll and then I'll have some vrm
information that will link in the
description below once we get an article
up if you curious about what BRM that
motherboards gonna be using so as always
subscribe for more go to
patreon.com/scishow his next stuffs out
directly thank you for watching I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
