so the SNES came out in North America in
about 1991 and the NES we didn't know
this till a few minutes ago came out 83
didn't know it was that that one before
the SNES it's a true proper console
development lifecycle even with the
modern standards of seven to ten year
launches today we're gonna be looking at
something that's been out on the market
for a little while now but we're gonna
tear down the SNES Classic and then look
as well at the actual SNES classic and
the purpose of this is really just well
we did it with the ps1 classic it was
kind of fun and interesting and we would
like to benchmark this SNES classic
versus the original SNES so we're gonna
take it apart first and see what it
looks like inside before that this video
is brought to you by the EVGA supernova
g3 power supplies unlike other power
supplies on the market that get easily
tangled the EVGA g3 power supplies are
modular and you sleeved cables so the
PCIe connectors won't get caught in your
hair when building system the supernova
comes in several options including
popular six with UI and 750 watt units
and it's fully modular with a noise
focused fan profile learn more at the
link in the description below so these
devices might be a bit of a flashback
for you this is my original SNES from a
couple decades ago that I guess probably
got it in the early 90s would be around
when my dad bought it so this is in
pretty good shape I mean it's got a
little bit of aging on it we know that
some of them have this yellowing effect
to a much worse degree than others and
from what Patrick on the team was
telling me that we think that might have
something to do with the flame retardant
that they used and how it was mixed in
with the paint but there's some articles
about about this out there somewhere
this one has aged well though to go over
the basics if you haven't seen one in a
while we are before taking them apart
first going to look at how a true to
form is the remake and so it's got the
slot of course power and reset and these
actually do move just like that one
moves and this one clicks into place
like that one does it was pretty cool
eject button sadly it doesn't do
anything here
because it's like it's the best one has
spring tension over there and then on
the front so we've got the the pin out
for the original controller right there
and then that is mimics over here but
you pull these off and then it reveals
the actual controller ports right there
and these are are not USB unfortunately
and the controller that comes with this
device it's cable is about three feet
long so we bought extenders with it but
like I said this has been out on the
market for little while now so you
probably know most that stuff on the
bottom side not much has really changed
the screw placement is different though
so these two screws is a game bit head
and we have one of those bits in our
iFixit toolkit so we'll look at that
later and then this one the screws are
hidden under these feet which is kind of
standard for a small device there are no
screws hidden under here as far as we're
aware now the backside I'm disappointed
in with the remake and that's because
the original if you never had a Super
Nintendo you missed out on this the
original had a hotline here and if you
called this number so it's got Mario
with the toolkit on it and it says
installation maintenance or service
Nintendo world-class service center
hotline so they've got that number they
also had a number in the manual for this
that and it may be the same one I don't
know
that was a game help hotline and I
called it when I was playing legend of
the seven stars and I was stuck on a
very specific part of the game where you
had to push I don't know I think it was
ynb to jump higher I didn't know that
you could use them in combination to
jump higher and so the the games before
people actually told me that it was
really impressive support and of course
that that's that's now no longer service
sees the internet for that so
disappointed to see that they didn't put
a sticker there with a hotline number on
it but that's okay they got the rest
pretty accurately the bottom one more
thing here that's different is the
original SNES that that I have has an
ext port on it and the ext port
was supposed to be used for CD expansion
like a dry a CD drive expansion or
should have been used for a Stella view
which was a japan-only launch in the
Stella view it's a mount to the bottom
of the SNES boosted the height of it and
it acted as a receiver and a decoder for
I think satellite signal or something to
that effect and what it did was receive
scrambled waves and then decode them
into things like new-age music and you
paid a service fee to the two two
companies do I guess the radio station
whatever may have been and to Nintendo
for that it did not come to the US so
that's what that was for and there's
there's not a fake port for that on here
but it's pretty close and as far as the
sizing we did a quick measurement to a
scale test earlier and for sizing this
is about ten point eight centimeters
across and it's about twelve point seven
twelve point eight centimeters the other
direction and this one is nineteen and a
half maybe nineteen point six and this
one is like twenty three point two or
something and so you do some scale math
you divide a few numbers and the scaling
factor of this versus this is actually
almost exactly the same as this versus
this so they've kept the scale it is to
scale or very close to its width in
measurement error because we didn't
didn't try that hard but it's pretty
much exact and and that's just cool to
see but not super important so I guess
we just started taking it apart at this
point the new one is straightforward the
old one I have to be careful with
because it's it's old and like it's
already got a crack here so that's gonna
be a bit bit fragile and then this piece
is probably gonna come off I'm thinking
in the process unfortunately because
there's a crack there as well but I'll
probably just glue it back on later so
we'll have to keep that in mind decided
we're gonna go ahead and glue that now
actually just to make sure by the time I
get to this device it'll be it'll be
dried
we need a Swiss Army knife with
hopefully a toothpick in it and I'm just
gonna superglue this nice didn't even
need a knife so yeah it's just some
adhesive on there and I just stuck a
fingernail under and pulled to try and
avoid cutting or that you damaging the
foam it's in perfect condition so that's
pretty easy if you ever need to take
that off for some reason yeah it just
kind of flex it till the adhesive gives
cool okay and then if we need more at
peace if we have plenty of that all
right nice first step is done those are
standard Phillips head screws and they
are let's see what size are those this
size this is a pH zero size pH zero will
fit perfectly so four of those support
nintendo.com it says they replace the
phone number with the website okay so
should just come apart yep that was
trivial there's the inside of that and I
guess what we'll need to do in a bit
here is take apart the proper the
original and see how close it is but we
have to cable clusters go in from the
controller inputs we have another ribbon
cable here and all that's doing is
linking up to an LED well I don't know
if there's an LED in there actually I
haven't turned it on yet looks like the
LED is on the bottom half so no LED
there as far as there is no LED there so
it's just linking up the power on the
reset buttons so
I think that's that's it you can see a
spring here for the scene that's reset
yes spring for reset so it's spring
tensioned has that original feel to it
which is pretty nice and then this is
just a toggle button so it's all there
is to that one is this a latch or is it
is it just a pressure fit pressure
fitting everything about these cables is
terrible
okay so pin side goes down for future
reference for myself or for you inside
down these are the same as these you you
find in laptop same as what they use in
there so a bottom Porsche and we have a
heat spreader that's probably not all
that necessary and then four screws
holding that down five screws okay so
it's time to compare these you want to
compare these side-by-side as we go nice
and clean that up later but that is much
more secured than it was before so needs
a little bit of a cleaning pass but that
chipped corner is now back on there so
we're good there so this requires a
special bit the bit it requires comes
out of this tool kit which is a really
awesome I fix a tool kit I will link it
below if you're interested in it so it's
this one it's a game bit that's a four
point five millimeter to see if that
will fit that will fit four point five
millimeter game bit is what we're using
here I set this giant tool kit aside and
nice it reaches to okay have not taken
this apart before so this has been
assembled since the 90s when it was
purchased and there's I don't I'm 99%
sure there's no active cooling so that
means there shouldn't really be any dust
accumulation that's a benefit of a
closed box that doesn't need to breathe
but paint still take the opportunity to
clean it out let's get a close-up on
this screw so everyone can see what a
game bit is there's what it looks like
almost looks like a gear I'm gonna take
these out at opposing corners good news
is it's gonna be basically impossible to
strip space yeah it's a really crank I'm
gonna do that
all right cool cool so there's four of
those and then then there are two more
six of those was there already died I
didn't take the screw out of there did I
I think so that looks like it had a
screw in it at some point because it's
moving a little bit nope all right well
easy enough separates instantly dope
okay cool nice perfect that makes it
easy okay so now we can have our side by
side this is pretty cool by the way we
have another video on the channel with
this Superboy SFC portable SNES then all
right now internally to be fair there's
not much reason Nintendo would be like
we have to make sure it's faithful to
the way the inside of the console was
because the whole point is that it's not
the same thing
and it's easier to use in the digital
era with modern TVs and things like that
or monitors but let's look at it anyway
this this explains now why I love that
button so much that reset button look at
that this thing is huge that's or the
eject button I mean that's the eject
button it makes sense though it's a big
lever and it has to pop the cartridge
out so I mean you've got a cartridge
that sits in here like so and you need
something to kick it back out so or
right here actually is where it goes so
make sense that you'd have a big lever
capable of pushing out without having
the plastic
feet break and cue the the the trope of
they don't build it like they build them
like they used to but other than that I
mean yeah it's obviously it doesn't look
the same and we need to look at the
actual components just to kind of talk
about differences in processing
technology so let's get this this heat
spreader off actually we can do that
without removing the cables
those screws holding the heat spreader
on nice there's a thorough pad that's
cut the this is always cool to see
thrown pad that has the branding of the
chip it was on top of in it you can see
that it says R 16 which is what the SMD
says as well but that's just from being
imprinted so good to go the area let me
try and safely pull these out if it can
actually it's not really any point to
doing that is there there's no point
doing that because it's already uh we've
already revealed everything there is so
we'll leave those in actually so four
components the one that was under the
heatsink was that our sixteen one all
winter tech our sixteen let's look these
up the all winter I'm gonna read from
the datasheet here this is from the
official datasheet for this this
processor so it's a quad-core CPU just
put that out there first and it says the
all winner are sixteen is designed to
provide a scalable well in context it
says the all winner are sixteen is
designed to provide a scalability
low-power capabilities
high performance application processor
solution for Internet of Things
applications which are performance
competitors in the terms of its system
performance great flexibility and energy
efficiency processor perfectly supports
various applications and mainstream
operating systems such as Android Linux
etc and to get down to the the heart of
this it is an ARM Cortex CPU at its core
and it's an arm cortex a7 it uses a
Mallee 400 MP two graphics architecture
maximally the video engine is capable of
1080p video playback or encode decode
and it supports MPEG 1 and 2 WM v9bc one
h.264 vp8 and JPEG and MPEG encoding
built to be power efficient and low
power consuming
so this is I mean it's it's an ARM
processor it's sufficient for playing
the games it's gonna be playing but
we'll we'll benchmark it later and look
at the actual frame time consistency
that's what we're really interested in
the next chip we're gonna look at is
this one now if you're wondering who
makes this chip its nunya nunya business
that company
Nonya is one of the his the only other
noteworthy memory manufacturer outside
of the triumvirate of samsung hynek's
and micron so samsung high Nexen micron
have jointly over 90 percent market
share or very close to it and none is in
there with a little bit extra they make
some of the the caching memory on SSDs
these days but let's look up this
specific part and see what this one is
so the chip is the of course very well
known Nonya NT v c c12 a m16 IP di here
we go
so the datasheet for this one says it
has a density of two Giga bits that's
bits lowercase B eight bits in a byte so
two gigabit density and it is a
configuration of by 16 it's got 1.35
voltage for the spec so 1.3 5 volts
going through it BGA package which is
already obvious has a 96 BGA count and
then speed is 1600 megabits per second
which is pretty good for this 13 by 8
and it has a point 8 maximum height and
millimeters I think that covers
everything I really need to know about
this so there's your memory as for the
rest there's an ax P let's look this one
up to ax P 2 2 3 looks like it's a power
management chip
I see so power power I see and then this
device service mount device is the MX I
see Mac chronics M X 3 0 LF for G 1 a1 8
AC TI and digit key has this one for
sale if you wanted to buy one yourself
they've got 1,300 of them and you can
get let's see a unit price it's nine
dollars 49 cents for one which is
actually extremely expensive that's
because it's one you buy them in
thousands which is what Nintendo did and
it obviously cheaper and memory size is
listed on digit key as being for gigabit
or 512 megabytes by eight and it's
non-volatile flash storage
it is SLC that's kind of cool and access
time 20 nanoseconds I think that's about
all we really need to know so there you
get that's that's what you have for
writable memory and then RAM and then
the processor and then power management
chip right there and there's nothing on
the bottom side I don't think what is
that that's with as well and to wear
these on my face everywhere it's cool
EP and 9 5 2 low-power hdmi transmitter
low power HDMI transmitter for that
right there so that just handles the
video out ok well that's that's about
the entirety of this of the SNES classic
and then it's got a single thermal pad
pretty thick one at that which isn't
necessarily good then sitting on top of
the core the CPU with a well sort of
heat spreader on top of it but it's not
really doing much in terms of power
output so we don't really have to worry
about the heat the rest of this thing oh
it might as well see if we can look at
some of this stuff these are actually
branded as Nintendo parts some of these
oh it's got Sony on it so they still
bought from Sony I guess
despite burning them 1989 that's when
this so this this device right here that
chip module 1989 and that's quite a lead
time on integration
the CPU was so man here you go this is
kind of cool the CPU on this thing was a
actually that's just reveal at first if
we can it's gonna be I don't really
nicely want to do this but let's just
take it apart does this have to come off
to get the rest of it out oh okay
alright so the three rod comes out the
spring goes on top of it like that I've
got it let's start with what would I
miss this isn't gonna come off to last
we have to get the rest of the board out
first there's your power on and power
off that's a satisfying a switch okay so
what's the best approach that is secured
over there underneath and over here wow
that's some solder job Jesus I'm a mess
it's very careful with that button think
now this can come off I'll put these in
that water I'm taking them out there
okay so this just mounts these hooks go
in in front of the cart reader so they
go into those sockets down there you go
blast this out with an air compressor
before I reassemble it and that reveals
a lot of the modules on here so s - s MP
as I understand it feel free to correct
me on these if you've done more research
but what I saw online that looks like a
sound processor of some kind what are
the rest of these the CPU is a reco 5 a
22 and it is 3.58 megahertz which is
about the difference you'd get now if
you change base clock to 100 point oh
one or something on a modern CPU it just
to give you perspective 16 bit design
incorporates graphics and sound
coprocessors that perform tiling and
simulated 3d effects a palette of 32,000
768 colors an 8 channel ad PCM audio
these base plot this is all Wikipedia
these base platform features plus the
ability to dramatically extend them all
through substantial chip upgrades inside
of each cartridge represent a leap over
the 8-bit NES generation so that's from
Wikipedia as for the rest CPU processor
eco 5 a 22 based on a 16-bit 6 5 c 8 16
core clock rates for ntsc 21.4 7
megahertz busses 24 and 8-bit address
buses 8-bit data bus oh that's
interesting
so in NTSC regions the nominal clock
speed of the processor is 3.58 megahertz
but the CPU slows down to either two
point six eight or one point seven nine
when accessing some slower peripherals
supports 8-bit or eight channel DMA
direct Mattamy memory access and for
memory it has 128 kilobytes of
general-purpose RAM not kilobytes two
bytes so
as opposed to the normal multiple it's
two to the tenth
so 1024 bytes is what you're dealing
with for that and then just for fun
resolutions supported include 256 by 224
progressive 512 by 224 256 by 239 512 by
239 and interlaced 512 by 448 or 512 by
478 the rest of the chips I think we've
pretty much gone over everything there
you go s CPU right there
there's your SS - CPU couple capacitors
under this this thing right here
nothing worth pulling the whole rest of
it apart over so there's the inside of
the old SNES and the inside of the new
SNES we've also got these parts here
which I mean a bit boring isn't it
because it doesn't really do anything
this has some mechanical elements to it
but not a whole lot and a whole hell of
a lot of screws in plastic holding it
all together
I have a feeling they'd built this a bit
a bit better now but pretty good for the
time because it's held up a very long
time and it's all ABS plastic they've
even numbered the parts they've got 22
23 and so forth now one last thing to
look at is going to be the controllers
and this is where I'm not going to take
apart the old controller because I don't
know I guess I could but I don't really
feel like dealing with cleaning it so
here's what we're gonna show you though
that's kind of cool now the feel is the
one thing we can't convey to you the
feel is is very genuine to the original
I mean it's it's damn close and the only
differences are really just because this
has been used and it's probably pretty
aged but not only the feel being roughly
the same looks pretty damn close to
there's a bit of discoloration here on
this I don't know if it was originally
this off purple or if it's just aged on
the original whereas the new one is that
gray color but if you look down at every
small detail including this notch this
assembly notch right here you can see
that that exists also on the old one
and then if we look around the edge of
the controllers as well every single
like a mounting point or injection point
it all looks pretty much the same so you
sag on top of each other they are
identical
it looks like Nintendo took the mold
from the original and reapplied it which
is what we saw with Playstations ps1
classic controller is well really
faithful representation if not
functionally identical and if you have
any doubts about it we can measure some
of this out see the distance between the
buttons that's pretty noticeable if
they're different
it's to center to center senator centers
16.8 senator center 16.8 so senator
center here is the same that's cool also
16.8 it's squared also sixteen point
eight thirty eight point eight six
thirty eight point eight six so I mean
it's it's a perfect representation
probably like the same mold or at least
remade the mold for it a really cool to
see that screw placements the same as
well the only difference is now you've
got some modern standardization and
certification text at the bottom or on
the back and we're missing what I'm
assuming there's an injection point on
the bottom Center but the controller
itself is basically completely the same
that's it for the teardown
of the SNES classic so it's not a new
thing we know it's been out for like a
year but we're just getting into some
console benchmarking stuff we built all
that software and use it on the ps1
classic and we thought you know might be
kind of fun just to go back with this
thing and kind of dial our tools figure
out what we're doing with console
benchmarking and then apply them to
newer things going forward so yeah
