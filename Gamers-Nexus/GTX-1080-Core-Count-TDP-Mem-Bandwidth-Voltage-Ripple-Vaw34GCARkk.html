Nvidia event and I'm back with this
system by BS mods and blue horse studios
and we're looking at two sli gtx 1080s
right now we talked about it last night
in our launch video where they release
the cards so the gtx 1080s here we hit
all the main specs coming out pretty
soon price at six hundred dollars for
the main model than 700 for the special
edition which is an OC edition the 10
80s are clocked stock from what we saw
on the screens here at 16 07 megahertz
and then the units last night were
overclocked to 2.2 gigger 2214 megahertz
the memory on this is g five extra gddr5
x by micron and that is 8 gigabytes of
memory on the cards not hbm to quite yet
in terms of other specs that you haven't
seen from our video last night it's got
2560 cuda cores and that's of course
pretty different from gp100 previous
video if you want to learn about that
that one's 3500 plus cuda cores the
memory bandwidth is 320 point 2 3
gigabytes per second and then of course
it overclocks pretty high as well so
let's talk about the mod here since
we've covered all the basics with the
cards and the mod as you see is rotating
this is an in one case we saw this at
CES i only get my finger out of there so
it's not chopped off the case was or the
system was built by BS mods bob stewart
rod rosenberg did that they did the base
coat paint and then wrongly christensen
did the dragon here which is named
Tessie the dragon from blue horse
studios and as you can see it's got a
tessellation pattern then turns into a
more realistic dragon so that's the
basics of the mod there's a name plate
on the back just like the one at CES
that was at the Inman booth that we saw
so that's let's pretty much the whole
thing for the case case itself not with
the pants or anything i think is more
than 2 grand if you wanted to preorder
one it was on newegg reporter but might
be sold out by now so that's pretty much
everything i have for you for the 10 80s
again previous video for additional
information the new information from the
last one that wasn't in there 2560 cuda
cores 320 gigabyte per second memory
bandwidth and then an effective 10
gigahertz memory clock on the g 5x
memory or gddr5 x from micron thanks for
watching patreon link emotional video as
always i'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
