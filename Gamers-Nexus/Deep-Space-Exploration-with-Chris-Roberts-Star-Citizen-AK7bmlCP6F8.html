finding a jump point charting jump point
and of course their other thing is that
I can't jump points the your navigation
data degrades over times and so it's not
just one person discovers the jump point
and then and then charts it so you'll
discover the jump point but people are
going to have to chart it on a regular
basis because the the actual path
becomes stale so they not weekend
weekends
well it's because they're like imagine
it's sort of wormhole that sort of kind
of like kind of slowly shifting and so
basically the path you've chartered
becomes invalid it's like in the pack
Southdown I guess we movement yeah
exactly so basically the concept is that
like you charted it maybe it's good for
a week or a day or whatever and then
there is a job for people to constantly
go through and chart it so then that
path can be downloaded to other people
and so there will be jobs available for
you know basically being you know
navigators now is that content dynamic
enough where it prevents feeling like a
grind sort of redoing the same thing
over or as the tourism or attorney that
people have never been in that well I
think I mean I think it's a combination
it's a skill of flying I mean so it's
not necessarily I wouldn't you know I
wouldn't call it a grab me a grind is
doing something that isn't fun or
rewarding sure so you know I mean
you know there's a there's a skill to
fly racing for instance in the game
right so like can you go through the
different rings quick enough and get the
fastest time so you know be you know
there will be a skill element to
piloting that will be challenging and as
you you know a lot of this is all gonna
be procedurally driven so you know kind
of the you know whatever you want to
call it the wormhole tunnels and the way
the things shift around that's that's a
challenge to sort of fly it and not hit
the sides or not hit one of them with
the big pillows or whatever so that's
just that's a best a sort of that's
that's a pretty good example of sort of
where piloting skills would be important
right so like there's you know different
things like some people like combat
skills and may not necessarily correlate
to just pure piloting skills right where
pure piloting skills could be really
good for say racing or constantly sort
of navigating wormholes or you know you
know we're talking about doing races in
an asteroid field and that kind of stuff
so that's more about you know having
good reactions you know knowing the
limits leadership and you know know you
know cutting the corner but not cutting
it so much that you lose control can
yeah so before we start with the
instance in I have to throw in one
question that there's this guy on your
forums who's been painting me for about
a year asking for an answer to something
and I keep forgetting to ask you it was
justified yeah
if he said if I'm out in deep deep space
and I find something valuable cargo
why's that I want to keep and there's a
station nearby can I bring it to that
station and effectively have them ship
it back to me be a some UPS shipping
service or something if he's running low
on cargo yeah there so actually that is
a part of the idea in the design of the
game so yeah we've managed inventory
like realistically so there's only so
much room you can have on your ship so I
said when you come in your hangars I
thought surely come in your person and
you can absolutely store items or
whatever our different locations and you
would pay to it and you can also have
people ship items are good to you so you
can have ships or equipment ship for you
and you know the actual shipping of that
would generate a mission for an NPC or
potentially another player so that will
be a contract so like it would be like
okay I you know I've got whatever I
found some you know multi super badass
cabin and I put it on the space station
I don't have room but I take it Space
Station and say please ship it back to
my hangar in Terra
well that would generate a mission that
could be taken by AI or an NPC to take
this package back and when it arrived on
terror then it would go into your
inventory okay for your hangar closest
any of us so so there's definitely
there's you know so part of the gameplay
would be like if you explore different
areas of the universe it's like what you
take with you is what you can fit on
your ship and you know potentially you
may you know have real estate in more
than one planet just because that way
you can keep ships or some keep
equipment on in those areas without
having to go all the way back to your
home base because it takes a while to
say go from terror to earth or something
like that
there's our answer hopefully that's good
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
