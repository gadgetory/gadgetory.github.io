following up the Seminole in the hey LEM
CPUs with major architectural
improvements in the second generation
core I Series at Sandy Bridge CPUs the
2600 was a soldered CPU with significant
performance uplift over Nehalem 930 s
and launched twin AMD's phenom 2 x6 cpus
were already embattled with the previous
intel architecture we revisited these
CPUs at last year but we wanted to come
back around to the 2600 K and 2018 to
see if it's finally time to upgrade for
hands-on to the one skinned CPU before
that this video is brought to you by
thermal grizzly and their high end
thermal compounds thermal grizzly makes
cryo not paste for high thermal
performance and conductivity without
being electrically conductive so you
don't have to worry about shorting
components Crona is particularly good
for replacing stock GPU pastes as cryo
not is a non curing compound
learn more at the link in the
description below sandy bridge marked
the last massive uplift and performance
if you look at processors core to core
it's a bit different now because now we
have things like the 9900 k where it's a
core count increase along side frequency
bombs but speaking strictly 2/4 core
comparisons Sandy Bridge really posted
big gains even over in a halo which was
already a pretty big improvement over
the cue 6600 and cue 9000 series
quad-core CPUs so Sandy Bridge
rightfully has a fond place in the
industry for a lot of enthusiasts who
likely got their start on the 2600 K
2500 K or similar parts the 2700 K is in
there as well it was a refresh for the
2600 K it's about a hundred megahertz
faster but we're looking at the original
today the 2600 K and the launch date
depending on how you line it up they
were manufactured around 2009/2010 for
the CPUs so it's get going on almost a
decade at this points about eight years
old depend on when you bought your Sandy
Bridge CPU so the 2600 K it's still a
damn good chip but there's a lot of
stuff out there now it's been a good
year for CPUs from Intel and AMD you've
got rise in 2000 series in 9000 series
8000 series so we kind of bench it
against all that stuff and see where the
2,600 K stands today even with
overclocking because we can punch hours
to about 4.7 gigahertz which is pretty
damn good for those CPUs and that really
changes things up in the stack and as
noted we did this previously not too
long ago actually but things have
changed a lot in the Seaview market in
the last couple of months so if you're
new here the article below in the link
in the description will include testing
methodology information that'll help you
get a firm understanding of what parts
are using the test
it also talks about things like what are
1% low as 0.1 percent lows and how are
they sometimes flawed because it's a
metric that we use for some of the
benchmarks and you may not be familiar
with it we choose games specifically as
representations for the engines and
api's that those games run so we focus
on testing for example one ego engine
game to cover all of code masters or you
focus on testing maybe one popular DX
out 12 title couple popular the x11
titles things like that you'll see
through the list as we get through it
how each one can represent its engine
and API because if you have one firm
representation of that engine that API
you can pretty much extrapolate the
performance differences across most of
the games that use similar engines and
api's so that's how we do our test and
we'll have more information in the
article if you're new here otherwise
let's get into it for the 2600 K revisit
of 2018
f1 2018 is up first using the ego engine
by Codemasters F 1 2018 offers a strong
representation of some of the most
common racing games available this one
tends to push extremely high frame rates
even at 4k resolutions in our GPU
benchmarks but this is a cpu benchmark
so we'll start with 1080p for 1080p and
high settings
we tracked f1 2018 I was hitting 165 FPS
average on the i7 2600
in the 1 skin i7 2670 3.9 gigahertz it's
performing behind the r5 1600 stock CPU
as well although we must give credit to
the 2600 K for keeping up for as long as
it has been 8 years now it's still
perfectly capable in this particular
title although it may be limiting for
anyone who can see the difference at 200
Hertz generationally the 4790k and
at 218 FPS average giving us an
interesting mark for comparison and
that's a large gain over the 2600 K
although both are quite old the 2600 K
is significantly older if you want to
use percentages and this nonlinear
metric of frame rate that'd be a 32
percent gain in terms of frame time
differences you're still looking at
roughly 4.6 milliseconds frames a frame
interval for the 4790k or about 6.1
milliseconds on the 2600 k normalizing
for this the increase is still about 30
1.5% improved the 8700 k ends up at 248
FPS average one stock for reference with
the 9900 k stock cv at 284 FPS average
these deviate from core account
equivalence with the 2600 K but the 8700
K does replace its position in spirit
overclocking the 2600 K to 4.7 gigahertz
really helps its position and planting
it firmly alongside the 4.2 gigahertz
overclocks are five 2600 and the 3.9
gigahertz overclocked r7 1708 core cpu
it has also closed in on the stock 4790k
we're all proving an impressive chip
even in 2018 let's look at some frame
time numbers from f1 2018 at 1080 P this
frame time plot will demonstrate frame
to frame intervals in milliseconds
between the i7 2600
alongside the 2700 stock and overclocked
remember these charts are ultimately the
most important not FPS charts FPS charts
are also important and hard to beat for
comparing a large amount of devices
simultaneously but frame times
illustrate real gameplay experience from
one frame to the next lower is better
but more consistent is better than lower
for perspective sixteen point six six
seven milliseconds is 60 FPS which you
get by dividing 1000 milliseconds by 60
FPS on present frame time represents the
interval of time between frames being
shown to you in these results we can see
some frame time spikes that are just the
nature of f1 2018 these happen sometimes
and are why our 0.1% lobe metrics are
all over the place for this game no one
CPU has a statistically significant
amount more spikes than others it just
appears to be native to the engine
overall we see that Lee 2600 K a 4.7 gig
and r7 2700 4.2 gigahertz to do the best
but all of these remain clustered around
four to six millisecond frame times
which is overall excellent performance
mind you most players would be happy
with either device for perspective
here's one of those plots with VI 999
hundred K versus the 2600 K in this one
the 9900 sits closer to 4 millisecond
times on average ranging between 3.8 and
4.5 with the 2600 K s thinking closer to
a range of six point six to eight point
four milliseconds when stock as for
whether you can notice that difference
well that's up to you but the United 900
K is obviously significantly better in
overall performance in 2010 s at 2600 K
and that also shouldn't surprise anyone
at 1440p back to FPS charts the 2600 K
keeps identical positioning as
previously this makes sense because
we're becoming GPU bound at the top and
while CPU load remains the same even at
1440p and with the GPO truncating the
max framerate there is still a
significant improvement at the top end
of performance with newer Intel CPUs a
hard line is drawn at the 4790k in this
benchmark where no AMD CPU has managed
to cross just yet that said the 2700 is
awfully close and one has to evaluate
whether other workloads that may shift
the CPU choice in favor of AMD's lineup
that's again up to you it just depends
on what you're doing if you're only
playing f1 the stack is clearly in favor
of higher frequencies from Intel let's
look at another game for more
perspective Assassin's Creed origins is
up next giving us a look at a Ubisoft
title with a commonly modified engine
for other Ubisoft games at 1080p medium
a CL ends the 2600 K stock CPU at 63 FPS
average with lows at 43 FPS 1% and 35
fps 0.1% this game is a bit more
consistent than some of the others we've
tested and so the low values proved more
useful here for rapid indications of
frame time consistency that's what these
are if you're not familiar the 1% in
0.1% lows are indicators for the worst
frame times as converted to fps without
looking at an outlier of minimums the
2600 K is stock numbers market has a bit
better than the overclocked through port
9 gigahertz r3 1200 in average
yes although measurable we should also
know that this difference is
imperceptible to any real user the low
frame time performance Delta is within
margin of error between them as well
overclocking the 2600 K pushes it up to
76 FPS average ranking it between the
modern r5 1600 stock CPU and the stock
2600 K performance here becomes limited
rapidly as evidenced by our maximum
frame rate of about 135 28 FPS average
even the modern I 5 8400 is
outperforming the 2600 K in big ways
ranking 92 FPS average with the 6 core 6
thread configuration it's to fewer
threads but the upgrades to cache and
architecture as a whole have benefited
the 8400 noticeably as has its frequency
and turbo boost changes the stock 8700 K
offers 113 FPS average roughly an 80%
improvement over the stock 2600 K the r7
2700 ends up at about 45% higher in FPS
when both are stock at this point nearly
anything would be an upgrade to this
2600 K it'd be hard to be upset really
with a modern i7 or 7 CPU when
considering these results whether you go
i7 r7 I 9 or other eyes will depend on
budget and on other use cases like those
exiting gaming we'll talk about that
more in the conclusion and in the
blender results at 1440p the 2600 k ends
up in roughly the same exact positioning
this makes sense because we're not
hitting a GPU stresser at these
performance levels nothing really
changes about the stack once at 1440p at
least nothing aside from the
chart-topping cpu is where the 2080 ti
actually becomes a limitation far cry 5
is up next using the dunya engine by
ubisoft
we recently explained that this game has
some frame time consistency issues on
Intel CPUs with fewer than 8 threads or
at least maybe a cache difference we're
still researching it making far cry one
of the best examples of why 1% and 0.1%
load numbers don't always show the full
story this is a known flaw on any FPS
reporting and that's why we showed this
frame time plot in the 9600 K review
illustrating that occasional severe
spikes can get averaged out when using
even a 0.1% low average and these spikes
although there aren't many of them are
noticeable they freeze for 100
milliseconds at a time and
cases this has nothing to do by the way
with overclock stability as is made
obvious by frame time plot and also by
1440p testing it's entirely to do with
consistency of frame delivery on i-5 CPU
is where we get sporadic frame to frame
intervals we're still looking into this
further anyway for a normal fps chart
the i7 2682 FPS average this ranks the
eight year old flagship CPU as roughly
tied with an r3 1200 which is about 100
to 115 dollars in 2018 overclocking the
2600 k boosts it to 102 FPS average a
significant uplift of about 26% this
performance figure ties the 2600 K with
the r7 2700 stock CPU even in frame time
consistency there is no objective
improvement to quote smoothness between
the 2700 and the overclocked to 2600 K
overclocked in the 2700 does provide
further uplift of course as dozen 8700 K
or similar 1440p by the way else further
illustrate that far cry 5 frame time
consistency is deeper than just
overclocking as averaging yielded
equally bad is your 0.1% low metrics on
the 9600 case stock and overclocked for
this round of tests that doesn't matter
here though the 2600 K ends up again at
81 FPS average which is completely
expected since we're not GPU bound
civilization 6 provides an important
benchmark for CPUs giving us a look at
tournament resolution time requirements
in Grand Campaign style games where AI
players have to think about their
actions considering thousands of options
the CPU rapidly becomes the bottleneck
as the GPU spins its wheels waiting for
the occasional frame to come through in
this instance turn time requirements on
the stock I 720 600 K are fifteen point
seven seconds per turn which is
calculated against 5 AI players and
averaged across multiple task passes
this means that for a full rotation back
to your own turn after clicking end to
turn you'd be waiting about seventy
eight point five seconds on the 2600 K
for perspective a modern 99 hundred K
stock CPU requires eleven point seven
seconds to process a turn
meaning that the full rotation takes 48
point five seconds
considering that turn time goes up as
campaigns drag on this Delta rapidly
becomes significant for turn-based
strategy enthusiasts the 8700 K also
does well at twelve point five seconds
stock an overclock in the 2600 K to 4.7
gigahertz provides a significant turn
time requirement reduction of 14%
putting it alongside the i-5 8400 stock
CPU and r5 2600 stock CPU this game
particularly likes frequency which is
why you'll see the rise in CPUs with a
higher clock outperforming their higher
thread count ur parts from the risin
families blender offers a look at
realistic non-gaming workloads that a 3d
artist might encounter
we used blender to make our two second
intro animation before this video that
you likely saw and we also use one of
the frames from that animation to
benchmark Seaview before it's we made a
couple of additional frames - like our
monkey had rendered test for stress
testing different workloads with the GM
logo render as the primary benchmark the
stock i7 2670 990 WX 32 core AMD CPU
requires nine and a half minutes for
that same render we move the decimal a
whole point to the left in that
comparison pretty remarkable differences
and in that same render the more price
consistent stock 8700 K requires about
33 minutes to complete the render no
matter how you look at it every other
CPU on the chart would be an upgrade
overclock in the 2600 K the 4.7
gigahertz pushed it to 67 minutes a
massive and noticeable render time
reduction of 25% this puts it closer to
the 4790k but still distant as the 4790k
reduces its render time over the
overclocked to 2600 case still by 18%
this application is primarily where a.m.
these offerings really start to shine
the r7 27 hari completes the GM logo in
about 32 minutes when stock which
reduces render time against the stock
2,600 K
by 64 percent overclocking the 4.2
gigahertz pushes it even lower down to
27 minutes render time if it 3d
rendering or tile based rendering
applications are urethane it would be
worth looking into Rison as a
high-performance part that comes in at a
relatively low price this doesn't apply
globally to all productivity
applications mind you photoshop still
really favourites frequency has those
premiere both made by Adobe but
does very well with tile-based rendering
and 3d rendering like in this benchmark
closing this one out then it's it's
still a really good cpu I 2600 K you
really have no reason to feel bad about
still using it because for pure gaming
and a lot of those games f1 is a great
example there's really nothing wrong
with its performance now if you put a 20
atti in there or even a 1080i in a lot
of instances yes the card will be
bottlenecked by the GPU but for a lot of
these games that are really more
intensive on a single thread or maybe
two threads the 2600 K still does just
fine once it's overclocked to modern
frequency standards and 4.6 4.7
gigahertz isn't too hard to achieve with
a decent cooling solution and maybe 1.3
5 volts or something around there so it
still does really well as always when it
comes to upgrading you just have to ask
yourself am i happy with the current
system I have is it holding me back if
the answer is yes I'm happy with it no
it's not meaningfully holding me back I
keep using it but one of the best things
you can do if you're not ready to
upgrade either because you just really
like the build you don't have the money
for it something like that you're not
happy with the current part selection on
the market then one of the best things
you can do is to bring a 2600 K back to
life or any CPU that's dated is to just
do a clean install of Windows completely
fresh start over put an SSD in there
make sure it's wiped clean install fresh
OS get all the drivers installed you'll
be impressed with how much performance
you can claw back because if you've been
using the 2600 K since it came out
that's a long time first of all it's a
older version of Windows but that's a
long time for Windows to just get
cluttered with stuff that slows down the
whole experience even when you're
launching games so one of the best
things we can recommend is a clean
install if you're not ready to migrate
just yet and that's something that
people often overlook when they think
about benchmarks because your framerate
is probably a hell of a lot lower than
it could be if you're running on a build
from 2010 for the software but if you
are ready to upgrade clearly in the
gaming department there are plenty of
options from Intel and these I was
pretty well there these days as well
with the r7 2700 for example and pricing
is good for AMD but if you want just
pure gaming Intel's doing well at the
top half of most of these charts if you
want something with a mixed workload
capability that is stronger and things
like
3d rendering performance maybe do some
3d modeling then AMD is an excellent
choice to consider the second generation
sort of second generation it's a
surprise it's a Zen plus process second
dish generation of risin risin mm is it
carries important updates for BIOS that
improve stability improved memory
timings all that kind of stuff so if
you've been wanting to move to a new
processor but you were hesitant about
the first gen rise and launch just know
that with the new motherboards that have
come out with all the BIOS updates it's
significantly improved and so it's a
very competitive and compelling product
now especially the r7 2700 or the i-5 20
the r5 excuse me 2600 now that said
that's kind of a lateral move for a
gaming performance um a lot of these
games that we demonstrated today so if
you're just gaming you're not really
going to get much of a a meaningful
performance uplift with that kind of
migration you would have to go 8700 K
maybe 9900 but the price jump there is
just its massive a 9900 K if you can
even find one is functionally an h EDT
priced product this is 7900 accent price
so we hesitate on that recommendation
but if you want something that more
that's more price equivalent to the 2600
K when it launched you can look at the
9700 K which we haven't yet tested the
8700 K which we have tested and does
very well or if you have more money in
900 K is worth consideration and again
just ahead there if you do have some
production applications that are maybe
more threat intensive like tile based
rendering then Rison is an excellent
choice to consider for those kinds of
workloads as well so totally depends on
what you're doing the CPU market has a
lot of choices these days where it's
it's a great opportunity to select
almost entirely based on your specific
use case there's no longer a case where
it's just like this Intel CPU is the
best period because now there are
different options and different price
categories now that AMD has entered the
market a stronger position than it was
previously able to so hopefully that
helps you out as always look at the
charts form your own opinions on what
you need but hopefully that gives you
some guidance on how you can move for
the 2600 K if you're still running it
consider overclocking it put a new
cooler on it something like that and
reinstall windows and you might be
be with it for another year or so
