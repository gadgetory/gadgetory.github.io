started at the PAX West EBG a live
stream I was trying to take this apart
ended up taking apart an older card
instead because this one ended up having
a very severe case of screw stripping
which tends to be what happens when you
have no tools to work with other than
whatever we can scrounge at a booth so
I've gotten that screw out so now we can
finish the teardown this is an EVGA
1080i FTW hybrid I think it's
technically an FCW 3 and it has the icx
stuff in it but it is supposed to be a
bit different underneath from what we've
seen with the sc2 hybrid so very curious
about that I think we'll see some new
stuff here that you all haven't seen in
previous hybrid products so it should be
an interesting one to tear down before
getting to that this video is brought to
you by synergy the software that lets
you share a keyboard and mouse between
multiple systems if you have limited
desk space and multiple computers to
command synergy removes the need for
separate peripherals or a KVM and works
as over the network software use our
link below to get 50% off the home or
provision with SSL so going over the
basics on this one the shroud is their
new black plastic very plain shroud
personally speaking I don't really talk
about visual as much on products
especially video cards but I did prefer
the one that felt more like a metal
shroud I don't know if it actually was
but the gray one that was very similar
to the reference foundered Edition
design thought that one looked a bit
better but not really an important
aspect of a video card anyway so no big
deal so let's take this part same
process as with all the others except
we've got one screw pretty removed
actually two or three moves because
there are problems so we're going to
start with taking out the backplate and
it's in two pieces it's diecast they are
separated at the center primarily
because from a die casting standpoint
what I've been told it's just easier to
manufacture that way they've also told
us that there might be some thermal
benefit by having that divider down
there and I don't know how significant
that
is probably probably mostly because it
was easier to make this way I think more
so the thermal benefit may have just
been something where they said oh this
is we can say this is a good reason to
do this but reality manufacturing is
hard and die-casting sometimes requires
things like that for a large plate so
that's it for this first one I think
we're about to reveal the you know one
more under the sticker we're about to
reveal the usual million EVGA thermal
pads which is a pretty good response
considering the complaints about a CX
we're not enough thermal pads like I was
I was talking to them about this at PAX
and yeah it's better to be accused of
spending too many pennies on something
like if they're all pad because
ultimately it is it does come down to
pennies then be accused of not spending
enough pennies it sounds a whole lot
worse if you're cheaping out on pennies
than it does if you have to increase the
price of the product a little bit to
accommodate all the pads this one does
genuinely help when we tested it with a
CX that was actually pretty big support
this one should as well and then we've
got an LED plate here with foam on it
probably four I don't really where does
that even go
so the foams over here I don't know how
much that house it might be like a
vibration damping thing that's probably
what the intent is but again you know
you're talking about something like an
FTW three hybrid looking at what it's
priced where it's positioned in the
market I think this one approaches 800 I
haven't checked though talking about
something like that why would you why
would just get a piece of foam if you
think it'll help these screws by the way
there are two different types of screws
in the back plate I've heard I think
through EVGA that this might change in
the future for the next design they
might be changing screws out which would
be nice because these types of screws I
don't know how visible this is
on camera but if we put both them over
here one's got a a wider a different
thread count-- fatter threads than the
other so they do at it does actually
matter where you put them back into the
card some of them won't fit in other
places I think the ones with the fatter
thread count go all the way through to
the shroud and the base plate because I
screw into plastic and then the ones
with the thinner thread count-- go into
other elements on the other side of the
PCB okay so that comes off there's all
your thermal pads for that one I don't
we're going to Vegas so much lately I've
forgotten what gddr5 looks like and it's
variants which is what we're gonna get
here okay
I think we can separate the yes we can
separate the Shroud but we're stuck so
this one has a new whatever you want to
call that hose clamp I guess previously
this was rubber you just pull it out and
this one is actually screwed in all
right cool so here we start getting into
the interesting stuff there we go okay
it's not a white PCB these are a little
more expensive than most the other
colors just because they're less
produced and this is for the LEDs so
that cables for the LEDs I think this
cable is for the one of these is for the
GPM LEDs which are right here
so those are responsive to the MC use
there are two or three MC use on this
board and those are used for temperature
monitoring and things like that so those
LEDs follow the MCU instructions what
next let's get rid of this small thermal
pad for what to fetes i'll pad for two
FETs
this aluminum and how about this thing
so this plate is new I think I don't
think I've seen that before
this is what those four screws on the
back Center are screwing into now
previously previously they had screwed
straight into the plate and the plates a
little different now so first of all huh
there's foam on the top that's to
theoretically help with noise damping EB
J's had some Pumped noise complaints in
the past
that'll help some of it most of it would
just be lowering the pump speed to like
90% PWM which you can do if you plug it
into a
an adapter and then plug that into your
motherboard so if you've ever had that
problem that's how you can fix it but
that's new so I mean obviously it's
covered up anyway kind of funny that
they've still cut out the hook-up for
their name considering it's hidden under
this but yeah that's different what's
really different is how it's mounted
diagonally which I guess would would be
part of why you wouldn't want to show
you you know you cover it up with a
shroud direct vram contact this means
that you don't have to worry about air
getting to it it's just gonna sink into
a copper plate copper plates connected
by a lot of thermal paste probably you
can see it coming out around the edges
here to the CLC cold plate which is also
copper and protruded and these some
reason these have tamper seals on them
something about so about these tamper
seals talked to EVGA about this on their
live stream and just like the one on the
back they were saying that these seals
are not warranty void of removed seals
that's I guess misunderstood they are
actually just there to help EVGA know
they need to inspect the card a little
extra when they get it back to make sure
everything is put back together properly
by the user but it doesn't void your
warranty it's it's just like a notice
for them
there you go so that's what I was
talking about there's all the thermal
paste that connects the vram plate to
the GPU plate this actually does help
and reason it helps is because you're
sharing the liquid cooling solution with
the vram and you only really need the
GPU to be so cool anyway after that
after that point once you're in the 30
to 50 range it's fine to share some of
the cooling solution with the memory
which can make more use of it whereas
all right yeah there's there's no reason
not to really so that's the cooling
plate that's a little bit new this elbow
bracket at the end is new and this
thing's new
let's pull off the vrm heatsink that is
a gigantic VR I'm I can't remember if
that's the same as the FTW 3 or not but
there's your fan back swept fan blade
design and pretty pretty densely packed
set of aluminum fins this should be a
pretty good they're all performer will
test it but at some point anyway not
anytime immediately cap cutouts and
everything else is directly contacted by
a ton of thermal pads as EVGA has done
lately somewhat of an overcompensation
yes but again given what they just went
through the in terms of controversy with
a tac-x it's it's probably better to do
that kind of response to show that they
did listen so can't really blame them
there for making a better product for
their high-end okay so these are the
same as the FTW three so yeah all these
components these are the 69 30s which we
saw them FTW three as well so this BRM i
think is identical i haven't looked at
that tw3 one in a little while
but we have videos about it from the
air-cooled version of the card looks the
same it's just it's an MT w3 PCB it's
have CW 3 BRM it's a new cooler it's a
different cooler that's the only major
change same BIOS switch up here same
board layout in fact I think you could
take an FTW three air cooler and just
mount it here and it would work so let
me peel this off the table so that's the
FTW three the hybrid one anyway and it's
a good layout I mean we've seen what
we've taken apart a lot of these now I'm
not sure how expensive is this one
exactly I know the previous ones were
like nearing the $800 range 850 850
Newegg 850 jet 850 850 850 850 850
dollars pretty much everywhere so yeah a
little steep you can get 1080i is
cheaper than that obviously in terms of
core performance like what you get out
of box they're not going to be that
different the advantage of liquid cooled
cards is generally that if you're
willing to manually tune it you and and
you would want to remove the fan on the
radiator or remove where it's plugged in
and plug it into your motherboard
instead you manually tune it to be
better cooling and better noise levels
than the air coolers that's the
advantage out of box it's it's a waste
of your money for most people to spend
$850 on this it's a very well-built card
it has a great cooling solution but you
don't need it so if you don't want to
spend 850 bucks there are 10 and 80 is
from plenty of brands EVGA included like
their sc2 gaming or sc2 black cards
which are not the icx ones but they're I
think 720 MSRP those will get you plenty
far but this kind of thing is basically
if you're willing to tune the cooler the
fan and things like that then you can
get a pretty good noise and temperature
performance it's just it does require
effort and it is pretty damn expensive
so not something we'd recommend for most
P
people but it's out there it's
well-built if you do want to buy one I
guess the main reason would be if you
start getting into overclocking whereas
we've shown with Pascal Pascal is really
responsive to temperature so short of
going with more exotic cooling solutions
if you are dealing with temperatures or
if you're dealing with overclocking
where every couple of megahertz matters
keeping the core colder will actually
impact performance every five to ten
Celsius tends to show up in frequency so
might get a bit more Headroom there but
it's probably not worth the extra money
for that extra bit of headroom for 99%
of people if you're the people who care
then great good there's a solution for
you I guess you have so that's the
teardown we might look into this more I
don't know if we'll do a full review or
when we've got plenty of other stuff to
work on but thank you for watching
