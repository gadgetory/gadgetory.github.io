dotnet and i'm joined by linda l chase
hey guys linda is going to be helping
out with the hardware news and game news
recaps every week yeah so I thought we'd
do a quick introduction and that Linda
is a you've been a pc gamer for a while
for a little while yeah so what
everyone's got their origin story yeah
ok so my origin story ok my origin story
starts like many other origin stories it
started with a with a an error I what I
wanted I think it was what was the game
oh yeah it was Lord of the Rings Return
of the King the pc version and i won't i
told my dad was like hey can I get this
game he was like do you have Lord of the
Rings turn the king money I was like no
ok so I saved up for it finally got this
game put it into our home computer and
after i installed the game the computer
told me essentially insufficient video
memory so that was the first time that i
opened up a computer and ever since then
I haven't stopped so it's been a it's
been a fun ride ever since I still have
my first video card I think it was a
like an 80s before AMD ba ngi it's an
ati x800 tea or xt800 or x 1800 to
something like that there's like a 512
or 256 megabytes card yeah time it was
top of the line yep it was five hundred
dollars oh my gosh i remember it was i
had to get up to at least i believe it
was 128 to play this game we only had I
think 64 the computer which is
ridiculous a thing about now we're cards
are at but i still have it i still have
it in the button case i forget which
card it was I know it was a TI card but
it's yeah it's been it's been a long
road since then both for myself as a
gamer and if you look at technology it's
been absolutely incredible ati was on a
game and I that's the other thing I
remember is a i think i spent about a
hundred dollars on memory i think it was
maybe two to four gigabytes for ram
which now you can get eight gigabytes
for like 30 bow easily
and it's way faster yeah so what what
games have you been playing with a lot
of games that have come out this week
what have you been playing I have spent
at least from me an absurd Tamil fallout
4 I haven't been able to spend a ton of
time on battle front yet I played the
beta enjoyed the beta liked where they
were going with that and been looking
forward to the release but it's funny I
actually have i pre-ordered battlefront
actually own call of duty black ops 3
and I have touched neither of those
games in this very short time that I
have had to play i've already logged
over 24 hours in the game so it's it's
been it's pretty much consumed all of my
free time had a lot of fun with it but
yeah that's that's essentially what I've
been turning my attention to recently
yeah fallout was I think steam says I
have 20 or 30 hours in it I've not
actually played the game that's yeah all
bent yet we talked about that talked
about that it's that's awesome it's a
stuffy if someone can do the math in the
comments below but it's a 30-second
benchmark course so you divide maybe 20
hours by 30 seconds that's how many
times we've run that certain I think you
guys want to take care of that for ya
down there someone can look at that but
yeah a lot of a lot of circuits and then
so for our first videos we're looking at
doing like a hardware news recap a game
is recap is there any game news from
this week or maybe stuff kind of you
looking forward to in the near future
now that it's game launch season that is
interesting to you yeah in the short
term probably month the thing I'm most
excited for is the release of the
Creation Kit early 26th 2016 or 54 yes I
will say this I've been able to gauge
the longevity of a game based on how it
is out out of the box with Bethesda and
one thing that I've noticed very early
on is that they've listened to their
fans and they've listened and watched
the people who have marred their game
before and what they've done with
fallout 4 is they provided a very very
strong foundation and knowing what I
know of what came out of Skyrim knowing
want
new vegas and we follow three this game
only has the potential to go up into the
right so that is the one thing that I've
been putting on focus on paying
attention to looking forward to possibly
doing some modding myself but man I'm a
leecher iiiiii enjoy taking the
advantage of people's creativity enjoy
taking advantage of people as a
ingenuity when it comes stuff like this
and fallout has with this title provided
us with a really solid floor and I'm
looking forward to seeing what we were
going to do with it so yes Skyrim is one
of those games where now four years
after its launch if I go install it the
first thing I do is not play the game
spend six hours finding it yes that's it
I've already done that two or three
times and fresh playthroughs I think I
was telling you the other day like I I
think I finished the game for the first
time I like march of this year because I
had I'd started the game over probably
from the time that I got it six or seven
times so often you run into a model or
it's like I got to start over like this
is this is this changes the entire game
for me like I can't I have to go back a
play to be a game with this mod I still
have not finished it really I only do
the open world with the mods Oh awesome
all I good i'm interested in yeah oh
that's that's where i was and again so
it didn't even start my interest in
facing game didn't even start to
somebody asked me about that final scene
in the storyline and I was kind of like
I honestly haven't got there because I'm
too busy enjoying all this stuff that
but does it didn't get less right so you
know that's that's just me that's where
I was so very cool so that's a is
there's your quick intro to lindale he's
gonna be heading up some of our videos
now and I'm still gonna be here I'm
doing more hardware videos with a lot of
depth so that requires a lot of time it
does a lot of number crunching and I
want to make sure I can focus on that
and then share some of the content
production with lyndell so we can get
some high quality gaming stuff online
and things of that nature because it is
gamers Nexus after all assess that's all
