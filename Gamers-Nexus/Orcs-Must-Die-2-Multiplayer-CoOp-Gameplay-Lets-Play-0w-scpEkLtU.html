Nexus dotnet and I'm here today with dr.
Khan
dr. GaN say hi to all the youtubers
hello youtubers how are you guys do they
can't hear you I'm going to invite you
to a party and we are gonna play some
works must die too
we've only had a couple of tries so far
several technical issues okay cool we
are in a party
I have an unmarked nightmare yet so I
guess we'll play on war mage okay I have
a nun look nightmare here and let's do
what do you want to do the first level
or do you want to skip a few do
whichever one you want let's do the
crossing a crossing always sounds nice
sounds good to me
I am ready have you unlocked some of
your skills Oh everyone let them ton of
skills super oh man I don't know if I
can compete a good poem or ring which is
my primary is randomly transformed
enemies and secondaries transform
yourself into an ogre I've been having
fun with Islands fantastic so whenever
you're ready
rivers are sweet man cross yeah play
except when you're playing against them
and then it's not that funny I guess we
can actually both play as the same
character I didn't know that looks like
it looks like it
oh good beaches your defenses what are
you taking I can see what you're taking
cool um
deep frozen stone I'll take barricades
dwarves there's probably too expensive
on this level don't take anything I
didn't think they will be fine actually
take whatever you want I'm just I'm just
gonna plaster yeah all right we're good
to go
I like you good to start we'll put the
traps down as we go okay they're coming
out of the rifts this time by the way if
you know yes I figured I'd painfully are
they coming through both of the rifts
because we have to not yeah just the
flashing one that's good I originally
thought that they were they were gonna
come through the doors I think the same
thing I did with this but I did this
thing whoa I am the older lady what is
you what is that a vanity upgrade oh
geez I know it's just a ring cool it's
it's some sort of weird ring
wow this game is much harder with two
players I think it scales
seems like it scales it difficult
looks like it it looks like well what
I've seen is the deal the thing I'm
using is good because it has a lot of
health but I die really fast if I keep
it I don't think it's a good idea I
don't have a soul house by the way so
I'm uh yeah ah ah we're fine we're okay
everything's gonna be okay man
I think I can't afford any traps but
it's gonna be okay you're about to die
oh that's never never dad you might want
to run the portal and heal huh
oh Jesus I'm slowed he's good let's go
heal ha
oh right healing in the middle of around
I'll make I'll make them into chickens
die do it
I have no mana wait oh oh no what the
excuse do that yeah what is that
and they are the other bad side effect
of my little ring what ha ha
just mind-control of Han yeah yeah this
sounds really oh god oh man oh man
behind you um ok I'll turn it into
something good if I have mana Oh normal
le sounds killable yeah can we heal yet
uh where is it heal
maybe we have to go to the actual portal
no nope nope well no yeah yeah there so
you're in trouble and I'll help you
let's just try not to die yeah geez
traps
okay I'll freeze in there oh my god
there's another up top
yeah let's um no problem man I got this
I'll just turn them into whatever I'll
turn them oh ah why whatever I am oh I'm
counting on you man oh no balls I'm
gonna die I'm gonna die I just get
stunned I think they're rocks on the
ceiling wait wait I'm alive I am Alive
again oh you just led an ogre sir whoo
Oh James that rain is terrible it is not
good oh yeah this is wrong why is all
going at ways we only have 11 things
left look like we're fine man we'll just
live through this we'll just lift
through it just believe in you don't
think so is that okay that's not you
know that's sadly nothing just keys with
he's with us you fit us he likes this
yeah that are just shooting really fast
ah killed okay
I'm never terrible okay are we help yoga
there's talking or that you can't can
you put some spring traps over here
some what traps Springs Springs yeah
yeah sure it's gonna be here our best
choice over there is I think mine will
launch odors - I'm not sure you see one
try and run them over the spring-trap
hold it
I'll stop trying to convert again should
I put in it should I put a dwarf down
here they're expensive like crazy I'll
just put some traps where it would or
wherever a seed in it maybe a barricade
more frozen stuff so they can everything
so expensive
okay so now they will be frozen whenever
they try and go anywhere actually
yeah I can put Dwarfs at the end of some
freezing traps over here put another
freeze traffic right here right here
grease trap put a dwarf in there strip
so this thing right here because I don't
think it's very useful just like red
power yeah that was just a mannequin
penny pate yes usual help ah anything
well I have no more money money and I
think I'm ready let's let me do another
sprint rabbit I think the top is much
more defended so we might be focusing on
the bottom are the dwarves in again I
don't know they tend to suck a lot when
I tried them before alright so what I
think what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
convert one guy and if it turns to be an
ogre or something really big it will get
mechanical yeah yeah cool as it wishes I
can see you from here so tell me if you
need me to mind control it okay
I'll just yell yeah
go uh-oh
what are these things I don't like him
top oh oh oh I got a cobalt ah die die
die die die okay yeah okay
your mind controls the same Oh
this might control of you are 800 not
a--not hunt is that why is it so big I
don't know but it's really hard to kill
it that's why I can't even hurt it yeah
it's really hard to kill so you just
might controller during that I'll try
and kill it live this or I'll just make
it something else about us getting bad
wait okay okay I gave you you do it it's
cool it's cool I got this guy again oh

haven't played this one yet okay I need
to buy some stuff there okay no you can
buy all you want explain explain or you
are there youtubers what everything
means what is what uh it's a skull based
system you get skulls
after you beat levels we got zero there
because we are highly effective actually
actually you got poop did we get to
mm-hmm sweet consolation prize yeah
uh-huh you can use the skulls as you see
here on my screen to upgrade your guys
and in this game you can actually refund
all of your skulls if you feel like you
bought the wrong stuff but this time
there are weapons and other things that
you can buy as well and I guess you have
the polymorph rain right yes and it is
good but it's fun but it can be very
deadly for your yeah nothing scares me
hey Basile blows up when damaged
vanity let's just outfits and stuff
it cost anything I guess you just unlock
it oh yeah okay yeah I'm gonna refund my
skull because I'm not happy with my
purchases and I'm gonna upgrade some
traps see I think I'm going to stick
with the spring trap I'll get all those
upgrades
I was good do you want to get the acid
sprayer you can go with the house and
spray okay
let's see
I'll get some spike trap stuff some
dwarf stuff
the door seemed more or less useful but
they got completely obliterated by the
no warrior thing yeah they tend to get
destroyed I gave him a knock back
upgrade though we'll see if that's any
better see what kind of weapons we have
here alchemist satchel place acid bombs
oh yeah I actually saw those at PAX
those are pretty sweet
you said something at PAX that pax east
I thought you were blind they had sigh
oh man appearing Daleks gauntlets look
kind of good I think I'm gonna go with
either the wind belt or I'm gonna go
with Alchemist satchel let's see how
that is
well acid bump seemed good yeah
what I did one two what I did what I do
I think I do yeah what I want to get is
the wind belt cuz throw into me telling
me backwards useful and you can pretend
you're Darth Vader or something uh well
if that's what you like to do with your
free time Steve all enemies have a
chance to drop coins
I don't want coins I want skulls the
coins give you skulls I don't remember
going to do
I'd answer but just gives you money deal
bonus damage with low health

things so I'm just gonna upgrade another
trap barricade self-repair barricade
