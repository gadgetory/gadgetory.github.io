piece inspired by a reddit post from
about a week ago the reddit post was
itself a response to a video where a
youtuber claimed to be lowering
temperatures and boosting performance on
rise in 3000 CPUs by lowering the vcore
value in BIOS we never didn't catch that
video as it has since been retracted and
followed up by the creator and the
community with new information even
though the original content was too good
to be true it was still based on a
completely valid idea
lowering voltage 50% of the equation for
power will theoretically reduce thermals
and power load the content ended up
indirectly demonstrating some unique AMD
rise and 3000 behaviors that we thought
would be worth testing ourselves in this
video will demonstrate how to know when
under volting is working versus not
working we'll talk about gains and
losses and get some hard numbers for the
master and the god-like motherboards and
how and the Rison behaves with regard to
clock stretching before that this video
is brought to you by us and the GN store
the best way to support our independent
reporting is through store gamers nexus
net viewers like you allowed us to
recently switch to paying for all of our
own flights to product launch events
rather than accepting flights from
companies this is made possible with
your purchases of merch like our GN
medium mod mat in stock and shipping now
and designed with GP teardown diagrams
and grids our 100% custom-made two-tone
shirt is also a great way to help and
it's currently on sale the shirt uses
95% cotton and 5% to last in for a
sporty fit with vibrant colors and was
designed entirely by the GN team learn

dotnet to paraphrase reddit user bossman
90's post which was in response to the
original content and a pretty well
exclaimed post lowering v core a little
bit without being an OC mode locking the
clocks locking the voltage and override
and everything will cause the requested
voltage per core the v ID to increase so
this is where it gets kind of
interesting the response is that with VI
D rising you end up with a result that's
nearly the same but lowering v core a
lot will like down to one volt will
initiate clock stretching and the end
result is that monitoring software will
report normal clocks so it'll look
like it's fine and it'll look like it's
stable at the new voltage but in reality
the performance will reflect that things
are worse and it's just it's similar in
GPU overclocking especially with AMD GPU
is if you're using well any tool these
days where it looks like things are
getting better with regard especially to
voltage numbers or in the case of GPU
overclocking frequency numbers but until
you validate with performance it's not
necessarily a number you can believe and
this doesn't mean that anyone who who
does go through under Bolton processes
or overclocking on GPUs is doing
anything wrong by instantiating worse
performance but thinking it's better it
just means that there's this really
interesting characteristic of the new
hardware and the way the software
interacts with it and reports on it
where you just you can't trust anything
anymore until you run some kind of
validation test and so for GPU
overclocking we use 3d mark to validate
that the score is actually going up when
the frequency says it's going up and
with CPUs you can use something like
Cinebench to run through it pretty
quickly so ultimately it's up to AMD to
explain what their CPUs do and why they
do those things what we're attempting to
do in this piece is replicate the
behavior that was seen originally and
then see if we can find a way to
undervolt effectively actually have the
the benefit that everyone wants to have
when they're under vaulting we ran the
3600 and the 3900 acts for this piece we
use two motherboards the master and the
godlike so we've got gigabyte and msi
both represented here for some different
bios's and we ran Cinebench our twenty
multiple times three times for
multi-threaded and then we also ran sync
single threaded passes with Cinebench
our twenty note again our twenty not
ar-15s the numbers are not comparable
between the two and then additionally we
did this stock we set for a second test
one volt and bios we also did a voltage
offsets with a negative offset for
things like for example - point zero
five volts to see if we could under both
it successfully and then we also ran
blender and logs the frequency but today
we're gonna focus on the cinder bench
numbers because it's plenty for now and
it tells the story just fine and we're
all tired and none of us have rested yet
so we controlled the core and the test
that called for it we apply at XMP we
did our custom timing
for all of our CP reviews these days and
we applied the DRM voltages as necessary
we also max out the fan speeds as we
always do pump speeds all that stuff and
we kept the ambient temperatures and
cooling as constant as reasonable plus
or minus about 1 degree Celsius for the
ambient temperature from a 21 baseline
otherwise we use the motherboard Auto
settings for both of the boards so that
means no LLC overrides nothing like that
to flatten out the voltage and the
boards will behave differently based on
how the manufacturers configured them so
all of that aside let's go through the
numbers here's our first two charts
we'll just take turns putting them on
the screen and multi-threaded and
single-threaded results for the r5 3600
it's immediately obvious that applying 1
volt V core tank to the performance the
system boots fine and it doesn't show
any signs of instability but on both
motherboards there was a very real
decrease in performance at stock the
godlike performed slightly better than
the master and the best undervolt offset
we could manage didn't significantly
change either board score 1.0 is a
ridiculously low voltage to run verizon
3000 cpus but both boards and both cpus
allowed us to set and boot at this
voltage at least it looks like that so
now we've established the truth which is
that setting a V core this low will in
fact degrade performance even if that
degradation doesn't come in a form as
obvious as a typical blue screen it does
happen so this is that unique behavior
we were talking about where
traditionally you set a voltage to low
and there's a pretty simple outcome it
blue screens it doesn't boot you get a
black screen something that's extremely
obvious that it hasn't worked so it
would be easy to get excited about this
result and we did - when we first
started doing this testing but of course
by the time we had started we already
knew what the outcome would be so that's
why we also tested voltage offset shown
in the next chart pushing an offset
lower than - point zero five on the X
570 master actually did cause
instability and boot problems this was
encouraging because it meant that we
were hitting real limits rather than
fooling ourselves by setting an
unrealistically low manual v core so
there was a chance it might actually
help performance with that offset it
didn't on the 3600 but the 3900 acts was
a different story
the third
900 acts like the 3600 performed much
worse than stock with a V core set to 1
volt the master actually outperformed
the godlike board here at stock as
opposed to the test with the 3600 so the
trend of rising 3,000 related test
variants continues the most interesting
part of these results however are the
scores with a negative voltage offset
the godlike board was stable with an
offset as low as minus 0.1 volt using
the 3900 acts and it gains 2% over the
stock multi-threaded score it's not a
huge leave but it's a real improvement
and the same behavior was shown on the
x5 Sony master single-threaded scores
were largely unaffected and actually
decreased slightly on the godlike board
with the voltage offset so the minus
0.05 offset for the 3900 acts on the
master is the best combination we've
tried there's an unholy number of charts
that we could generate from the data
we've gathered so we'll just focus on
the msi godlike board for most of this
piece just because the graphs for it are
a little easier to read and they all
tell the same story these next charts
are all frequency plots
we've also zoomed the frequency charts
to a 2,000 mega Hertz range in order to
make the difference is more obvious so
we have intentionally set a nonzero axis
here this first one shows the r5 3600 on
the godlike at 1 volt stock and at minus
0.05 volts offset from just these
numbers it would appear that the 1 volt
V core are the best numbers as the r5
3600 how they constant 4.2 gigahertz
throughout the three multi-threaded
passes as well as the lawn
single-threaded passes the next chart
shows the same type of data except that
the r9 3900 X is used instead on the
3900 X clocks were less consistent but
still reported holding higher clocks
then stock with a reported 42 25 during
the multi-threaded tests and a
single-threaded tests it logged boosts
to 4.5 gigahertz and beyond but the
stock results went out here with a
fairly consistent 45 75 mega Hertz for
most of the single threaded test it's
clear that the 1 volt V core results
isn't actually performing better on
either CPU
even though it kind of sounds like it
might be this is a simply shown by rough
comparison of how much longer the test
took them to complete which you can see
by looking at this chart where the line
takes longer or by looking
earlier scores these next two charts
show V Corps as logged by hardware info
it's admittedly not the best way to do
things it'd be better to measure in
ml/cc cap or something like that but
this is good enough the 1 volt bio
setting works according to software
logging although the next batch of
charts might contradict that at the very
least this proves that bios as an option
is doing something even if the end
result isn't what we want which is lower
performance here as an unwanted
by-product stock feed core for the 3,600
shown here and this chart was reported
at about one point three nine volts
under all core load or about one point
three four four volts with a negative
offset applied both fluctuated between
one point three eight one point four
volts in single threaded tests the 3900
acts showed the inverse and we can pop
that one up to the stock and offset
results both managed to stick to about
one point two seven volts in the all
core load and a gap showed itself
instead and the single threaded pass
with stock v core 18 one point four
seven one point four eight and the
offset voltage holding at one point
three nine these charts show v ID
instead that's the next one the average
core v ID numbers stack up differently
than the reported v core it's the 3600
set to one volt that requires the
highest voltages during the e
multi-threaded test at about one point
four versus one point three six one
point three seven stock and offset
moving into the single threaded test has
the offset results averaging the highest
of eid with the 3900 x chart there's a
more clear division during the
multi-threaded test with the stock the
lowest at one point two three volts than
the offset at one point three two then
the one volt results at one point three
four to one point three five single
threaded test aden push them closer
together with all the results landing in
the one point four seven one point four
nine range as mentioned earlier we've
chosen not to include the results we've
gathered on the XY of so many master
board but they back up these results
that we've seen on the godlike so far
for our final charts we've stuck some
results from boards together because the
points is simple t die the temperature
of the die is vastly lower on both the
our five thirty six hundred and the our
939 hundred acts with v core set to one
volt and as the previous charts have
shown a clocks are higher but
doesn't mean the performance is better
much like GPU overclocking must to be
validated with performance tests CPU
volt frequency changes at least with
these CPUs have to be validated with
performance a lot of the time in the
past and also with most of the Intel
processors it's pretty easy to just see
if it blue screens or not and that's
your validation of if it worked but it's
not so easy this time it's very easy to
trick yourself into thinking that all
the numbers are better but actually
sacrifice performance by accident
the only other notables are the 3600
with a minus 0.05 volt offset on the X
570 master which was slightly cooler
than the stock setting in multi-threaded
testing with an extremely small bump to
its average score the 3900 acts to the
point one volts offset on the msi
god-like ended up much cooler than stock
and single threaded testing but with a
minor performance degradation
sorry conclusion is that yes obviously
there's a pretty easily reproducible bug
we suppose AMD might call it a feature
but we're setting V core too low on the
rise in 3000 CPUs will cause a
significant decrease in performance
while hardware info appears to report
better everything better at least better
clocks and temperatures and this all
does make logical sense there's every
reason that I mean you lower the voltage
which of course the temperatures gonna
go down you lower the voltage of course
the power consumption should go down and
the frequencies should stabilize on
these new CPUs because they're so bound
by temperature as we demonstrated in our
Allen to positive 84 to minus 80 or so
degree testing so everything here is
logical it's just that once you actually
test it the scoring is does not match
what you would want it to it's worse in
most cases so what we also saw is it's
possible to tweak the voltage down on
our 3900 X anyway for lower voltages
than what you might run otherwise you
can get some minor benefits and score
and temperature which causes the score
benefit things like that we were also
able to run as we showed in our original
review a higher all core clock of about
4.3 gigahertz at just one point three
four to one point three five volts which
is really pretty damn good so it's going
to depend CPU to CPU this test and
obviously doesn't show you every CPU and
then there
gonna have their own unique
characteristics per unit not just per
model or SKU so when leaving everything
else stock setting a small negative V
core offset seems like it helped more
and yielded more predictable behavior
than just setting a straight flat V core
number a manual v core override the
benefits buried by CPU by motherboard my
workload but in the very least it was an
interesting item to follow up on we had
a lot of you asking about it we've been
completely buried the last few days and
haven't had a chance to look over any
other content so we appreciate you
giving us a heads up because at this
point viewers are like our boots on the
ground because we're completely buried
and stuff to do but anyway yeah it's
it's a valid idea and there is a way to
kind of get under volting to work but
just make sure you validate each time
and like we said earlier this you know
it's very easy to end up in a situation
where things look like they improved so
there's absolutely no no harm and ending
up in that situation and we will give a
quick shout to I believe it was the
optimum tech we didn't get to catch the
original video we only heard about the
content but you know huge kudos as
always for following up quickly and
posting the new information there's
absolutely no shame with new hardware to
discover something that you think is
good and then I actually it didn't work
out the way you thought it did because
this stuff's new and spoiler alert CPUs
are extremely complex so it's cool it's
cool to see the whole community poking
at these things with sticks and throwing
rocks at them and seeing what happens
because that's what we have to do to
understand today CPU at this point
they're very complicated these days
especially as they begin to adopt more
and more GPU like behaviors anyway
