at computex 2016 and we're gonna be
looking at the new dark bass 900 this is
a new sort of full tower case from be
quiet they previously had the sb-800 or
silent base a 100 so this is not the
same thing it's completely new tooling
and before getting to that all of this
coverage is brought to you by msi and
their x99 a broad well egain
motherboards including the titanium so
the case at the dark basic 900 comes in
two versions there's this one it was the
non-pro just dark base 900 there's this
one the dark base 900 pro the
differences between the two before
getting to the really core specs of the
case or the pro has a quick charger so
it's got a quick charger mountain to the
top it's got all the logic there to
quickly charge laptops phones whatever
on the back there's a fan hub which
exists on both but the fan hub on this
one is pwm controlled to the motherboard
so that means that the motherboard can
still control and speak to all the fans
even though they're plugged into a hub
that's the main difference there other
differences include the tempered glass
on the left side panel in this case for
the dark base 900 pro this is just a
normal steel side panel and then on the
front there's a controller for RGB LEDs
there's well five color leds anyway so
there's a strip couple of LED strips in
here they have five colors you can
toggle through them with a button and
then there's another slider for fans
beat toggle so that's really the
differences now in terms of the core
specs here it's obviously a pretty big
case it's mostly modular and to one
degree pretty unique and that is that as
you can see here we're actually looking
at the left side on the right side of
the case and that's because you can pull
this whole tray out and flip it and
invert it so you got the inverted layout
here versus the standard layout here and
this inverted one may remind you of some
other cases we've looked at in the past
like the 600 see where you actually end
up with the video card mounted like this
and it's upside down it's that exposes
the faceplate up no real cooling
difference for the most part that we did
see a benefit from the coarser set up
just because they had their power slide
mounted in the top so there's some
differences but mostly it is preference
and in substantial with regards to
cooling and performance there's the
normal sort of padded side panels that
be quite has done in the past like with
the 800 sb-800
some noise absorption or damping and the
rest of it is all down to cooling so it
comes with a couple of 1 40 millimeter
fans and there's room for up to four
hundred twenty millimeter radiators top
front and I believe there's one more so
that's pretty much the dark bass 900 the
prices are again 200 for this one this
is the non-pro 250 for the pro model and
we'll be trying to review these as they
come to market but they're not out just
yet so thanks for watching as always
patreon link commercial video we'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
