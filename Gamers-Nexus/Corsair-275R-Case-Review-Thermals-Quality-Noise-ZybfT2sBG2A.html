reviews to look at something more
reasonably priced this is course there's
the 275 R it's an $80 case with the
tempered glass version or 70 for the
acrylic which more or less becomes a 270
R at this point the predecessor to this
case so the main changes from the 270 R
which we've actually previously given an
Editors Choice Award and have
recommended several times the changes
primarily are tempered glass of course
natural progression of the industry
vertical GB amount is available there's
a change front panel and that's most it
there are a couple other changes we'll
go through as well but those are the
major ones before that this video is
brought to you by thermal Grizzly makers
of the conductor not liquid metal that
we recently use to drop 20 degrees off
of our coffee leak temperatures
thermal grizzly also makes traditional
thermal compounds we use on top of the
IHS like cryo not and hydro not pastes
learn more at the link below let's go
over the basics and then we'll get
through the gripes and the good stuff as
well along with thermal and noise
results first all basics if you likes
the 270 our this is one of those just
with the class there are some other
changes as I noted one of them is the
power supply shroud it now fully covers
the bottom that changes some of the
airflow dynamic as we'll find in the
thermal section and there's rubber
grommets as well so that's what's the
changes in terms of cooling it has two
fans of both 120 s they are located
front Center middle slot here at splits
between the CPU and the GPU and then the
rear exhaust and there are options for
an additional one 120 at the top one 120
in the bottom and some slots at the top
for cooling as well so that's the that's
all the cooling very basic now I've been
holding this allen key and I've been
dreading this moment because we need to
open the case to take a look at the rest
of what's inside of it and Corsairs gone
with allen screws now I've been a
foreigner to allen keys I build bikes
literally every screw on a bike is one
of these so I don't have a problem with
them where they belong I don't know why
they're on
panel of a case though and there are
four of them so what we're gonna do
before progressing I'm gonna take this
panel off we're gonna speed up the
footage and then we're gonna talk about
the process that's my favorite part of
the case we'll talk about that more a
second okay okay got it sorry that took
a while so that's the side panel removal
process basically the the problems I
have with this case primarily revolve
around that and it's not a bad thing to
have your primary concern be four screws
cuz you're probably taking it off once
or twice I guess and that's hopefully
the last time you'll have to deal with
it it's not the most egregious thing
we've seen in case design of the last
year but it's annoying and let me give
you the reasons why reason number one
these rubber grommets two of which just
fell out I mean we recorded the process
all I did was unscrew them and yes I
could have held the glass in place but
even if you do that these rubber
grommets will fall out because they just
kind of sit in there and they're only
pressure fitted by the screws themselves
so there are four grommets they fall out
it's very annoying it's even more
annoying to put them back on the glass
and then put the glass on the case and
this is something coursers done in the
past with other cases so I'd like to see
a better solution to these grommets that
fall out so easily secondly typically
with glass panels on cases you have two
primary solutions to mounting them one
of them is something that Thermaltake
does of all people where they hook on
the bottom just with plastic or whatever
material they're using down on that part
of the case steel or plastic that's just
a hook and so when you release it the
glass leans at a 30-degree angle so
that's a good solution another solution
that courser has even done in the past I
think including one of the recent cases
is you standoffs so you can use
standoffs on these four corners and
actually we tried to do we tried to put
case standoffs in there they're not the
right thread but that's another good
solution to and then you get rid of this
problem as well so there are solutions
to these problems and they're not being
used and I don't understand why on top
of all these other side panel and
mounting complaints the tempered glass
panel is just slightly longer than it is
tall
so it's easy to get halfway through the
reassembly process and realize that it's
on sideways so overall not the easiest
thing to put on or take off the case we
asked why allen key is that specifically
or Allen screws were used for the glass
and the phrasing of the question was
more or less why not thumb screws the
answer to that from Corsair was because
they don't want or they're trying to
avoid users getting fingerprints on the
glass when removing a thumb screw couple
points here one of them unless you're a
gorilla removing a fat enough a
sufficiently fat thumb screw we'll call
it the the sft coefficient for a thumb
screws a sufficiently fat thumb screw
unless you're like a monster when you're
trying to remove it you shouldn't be
making contact with the glass in the
process secondly that doesn't answer the
question of why why Allen why why not
Phillips and again I don't have a
problem with allen keys
I have probably screw specifically and
how long they take to remove now I could
go get my own - all but that wouldn't be
what the user would be doing that's not
the biggest issue there the biggest
issue is just like it's it's kind of
just like oversight in general because
rubber grommets fall off as soon as you
remove the panel panel falls off the
case it's over all clumsy and doesn't
make sense because Corsair themselves
have made far better cases and panels on
things equally priced so I don't get it
I I'm I'm just I'm just confused but
that's the panel we don't need to talk
about that anymore the rest of the case
is not that bad so they have a white and
a black or gunmetal version pretty
standard the white overall is a good
color white is notoriously difficult to
color match so match
plastic and metal is difficult enough
but Coursera specifically is dealing
with kind of alright it looks like
they're trying to simulate a brushed
aluminum design on the front almost
which makes it even harder to match it's
pretty close it's close enough to not be
like something's that really call too
much attention to but it is slightly off
not a big deal in this case they've done
better than a lot of white cases we've
looked at you can see some of the primer
actually on this side I can see primer
still or whatever the underlying plastic
material it is I don't know if they
prime it but either way it's a it's
clearly a an unpainted plastic basically
so some quality control stuff there
nothing really major you'll never look
at that part of the case once it's on
the floor
you're not gonna see it not a big deal
for the front of the case it's pretty
easy to access which is always a good
thing it's just a pull on the panel like
usually so we like that of course pretty
simple though there's a good dust filter
right here generally easy to access the
the other quarter case we just looked at
the 500d which is way more expensive has
those nice side pole filters but for an
$80.00 case that's pretty standard
nothing too special there but nothing
that they've done wrong so we like that
overall I guess I'll mention as well
there's an LED here too and we actually
like the way this was implemented so
it's not like the Silverstone one where
you get the the under glow logo it's
just under glow in general it's just I
think it's just a white LED and it
connects via cable just to the front IO
or the top IO so you don't need an extra
cable for the LED which is great this is
a problem on some cases where you end up
with a lot of extra cables just for some
aesthetic LED why there so you think
about it there's zero reason that an LED
needs to take up an entire slot on a
motherboard somewhere or a molex
connector they don't draw that much
power so of course their job well done
here we like that it's integrated with
the i/o PCB so it's all nice and clean
and the user doesn't have to
anything take-up motherboard slots with
it we like that on the interior the 275
R is functionally identical to the 270 R
which is a good thing we like the 270 R
it's functionally identical though not
literally
we tried switching the 275 R's tempered
glass onto the 270 R but the chassis is
slightly too big the cable cutouts now
have rubber grommets and well-placed
cable tie points around them on the 275
R and the power supply shroud now
extends the full length of the case but
otherwise it's fairly similar the cutout
in the shroud for the GPU power cables
is a feature we'd like to see more often
and one that we liked a lot the interior
features the direct airflow path TM
cooling which is apparently a trademark
able phrase that relates to not having
Drive cages in front of the fan but I
mean you can have direct airflow paths
insofar as I the the panel I guess not
allowing it but their version of direct
airflow path means there's no stuff here
in the hard drive cage area it doesn't
mean a literal direct airflow path like
straight into the fan and straight into
the CPU but whatever it's just marketing
so overall we do like the interior
layout of the case
there are the usual 2 3.5 inch drive
sleds situated in the bottom under the
power supply shroud pretty standard
these days and there are also two 2.5
inch SSD mounts on the back of the
motherboard tray so you can fit a total
of four drives and then thankfully the
3.5 inch cage is also attached by screws
rather than being riveted which is
another problem we have with a lot of
cases and the screws of course can be
removed so if you need more space for a
longer power supply or cables are just
getting messy they're not using a hard
drive you can get rid of the cage pretty
easily before getting into the thermal
section first some discussion on the 270
R versus this case this is basically a
refresh it's in the same family they've
added five numerically to the value so
it's obvious as refresh and that's fine
it has tempered glass it's made some
other changes that we actually do like
quite a bit it's made some changes
obviously that we don't like but that's
the nature of any product revision
now in terms of thermals and other
differences acoustically there's not
really going to be any difference
because there's still the two fans that
are basically the same specs spin at the
same rpm with the same front panel
situation more or less thermally there
are differences in some tests and to
give you an idea before getting into the
charts of why they are different keep in
mind that the front panel is
significantly different on the 270 are
where there are mesh guidelines on the
front sides and it's a different size
different depth and a different angle of
intake for for the panels so this swoop
on the side is slightly angled and then
more importantly the power supply shroud
again is longer on this case that will
impact GPU thermals additionally as a
small note the 270 R has a grill in the
front of its short terminating power
supply shroud which also impacts
thermals so you will see differences
between the two cases
despite being basically the same family
the same fan configuration and the same
layout internally we went overboard with
the additional tests this time again but
it couldn't be helped our initial plan
was just to test the stock configuration
an additional 140 millimeter intake fan
and vertical GPU orientation which would
make six test runs along with our 3d
mark and blender tests when we installed
the 140 fan though the resulting
temperatures were higher than they had
been before fitting the extra fan into
place required moving the stock intake
fan down slightly but logically there
should have been more airflow across
every component retesting showed the
same results multiple times our theory
is that in the stock configuration one
intake 1 exhaust our CPU tower cooler
independently pulls
cool air in through the large top vent
in the case adding the 140 millimeter
nock to a fan in front of the CPU cooler
created a positive pressure inside the
case which meant that the cooler would
now receive air only from the intake
fans as opposed to drafting it
independently through the top vents
which were only a couple inches away
from the CPU tower fan because of the
extremely closed off front panel the
intake fans probably recirculate some
warm air from inside the case
raising the CB
Richard to verify this we did more tests
with the top vent taped shot and by the
time we were done with everything we'd
done more than 12 test runs and figured
it out though
starting with 275 are only for torture
testing our CB torture test average 55
degrees Celsius over ambient for the CPU
temperature with the stock configuration
taking the front panel off lowered this
to 50 point 2 degrees Celsius delta T
over ambient as expected and that's not
the worst Delta for a panelist test that
we've ever seen so really not too
critical here couple degrees 5 degrees
is certainly decent but it's not like 10
as we've seen on some other cases
Corsairs panel isn't as much of a
limiter as its stock fan configuration
is here but it certainly isn't helping
as mentioned before adding an extra fan
actually raised this temperature to
fifty eight point eight degrees delta T
over a mid and one test and fifty eight
point nine degrees in another we saw
consistency we knew that taping the case
shot would make temperatures warmer
overall but if our theory was true it
would flip the order of results and a
test with an additional fan would be
cooler taping the top shot in stock
configuration raises the CPU temperature
from 55 to 61 point four degrees with
the extra fan in place taping the top
shot had barely any effect and the
temperature only grew or increased by
0.1 degrees over the stock test that's
well within margin of error a vertical
GPU orientation also resulted in a fifty
eight point eight degrees Celsius delta
T with warm air dumped out of the GPU
cooler and into the CPU above partly
radiative heat off the backside and
partly the open face design spewing air
into the glass so before we get into the
comparative chart for CPU thermal is
just to make that perfectly clear
basically what we found with our very
specific configuration this is not
universally true case testing is the
least scientific of all testing because
there are a million variables so with
that said with our specific
configuration a 140 millimeter fan here
didn't really help anything for CPU
thermals and we strongly believe that
the reason for this after taping off the
top and doing additional validation runs
is that the CPU teracle is so close to
this top vent that it's able to just
pull air in
through the outside and shoot it out the
back as expected when we put the knife
to a fan here what's happening is the
the pressure going into the case now
exceeds the pressure going out of the
case we have a positive pressure setup
the air from the front is partly coming
out of the top on its own and some of
that's making it to the CPU cooler the
CPU cooler is no longer drawing air
externally that's our hypothesis
additionally we believe that the
open-faced cooler on the card spoken
from experience is pushing some of its
warmed air into the power supply shroud
we've found that this these shrouded
cases do have the impact of increasing
GPU temperature it pushes its air into
the shroud that air will get
recirculated because it has to get out
of the case and unless it's getting out
through the minimal amount of cracks and
the i/o covers in the back of the
expansion slot covers what it's doing
ultimately is getting pulled back up
through the CPU fan and pushed out the
back of the case so that's what we think
is happening
comparatively for CPU temperature 55
degrees Celsius is approximately what CV
temperature was in the 270 are with the
case fans running at 10:50 rpm but
running them at full speed like we do
with all of our stock tests that lowered
the temperature in the 270 our two fifty
two point eight degrees the 275 R and
270 are not significantly different in
thermal performance from one another
generally but when we increase the fan
speeds to max on each we are seeing some
difference and the fans do run at the
same rpm spec the vo 71 and s 340 elite
are all serve on this temperature range
but the similarly priced mattify C and
cheaper plastic sided redlines euro six
are both cooler CPU temperature was 57
point one degrees in the torture test
with a best-case delta-t of fifty three
point three degrees with the front panel
removed as with the CPU adding an
additional fan raised the temperature to
fifty seven point eight and fifty eight
point four in two tests although the
increase is smaller and therefore less
conclusive existing within error margins
there is somewhat of an increase that we
saw a couple of times with the top taped
shut and in stock configuration GPO
temperature actually drops it to 55
degrees exiting the margin of error and
that establishes that the pressure
patterns in the
with our specific cooler and videocard
created the behaviors we saw elsewhere
temperature also increased back to fifty
eight point one degrees Celsius within
margin of error of stock baseline with
the additional fan added back in GPO
temperatures are already difficult to
compare thanks to frequency boosting but
there are also some very specific
airflow and pressure patterns at work
here and there effecting results in some
ways that are very subtle but we can say
for sure is that our system is behaving
in a way that is influenced by the
pressure almost more than that extra fan
and that's going to depend on which fan
you use as well naturally mounting the
GPU vertically resulted in a comically
high temperature of sixty nine point
seven degrees Celsius over ambiens which
was almost a welcome return to sanity no
matter what vertical gb amount sucked
for open phase cart accounting for
ambient that puts us into the nineties
and GPU throttling hits hard at eighty
four C and again at 60 degrees Celsius
so we're well above both of those
numbers comparatively the baseline
fifty-seven point one degree measurement
is much warmer than the 270 r's fifty
one point six degrees and more
comparable to the pure base six hundreds
best results or the in win 805 i it's on
the warm end of the chart definitely but
doesn't cause the runaway thermals we
see with for example vertically mounted
GPUs of course there's previous cases
performed better for our configuration
with GPU cooling which we believe to be
a factor of the front panel changes
primarily and the very significant power
supply shroud change along gating it and
the latter is more likely to impact GP
performance most heavily the two
seventy-five are landed at the high end
of our 3d mark results with the GBO
temperature of sixty point one degrees
celsius that's in between the BitFenix
ENSO and fractals to see series cases
which ship with a similar fan layout
cases with full shrouds that rely on a
single intake fan to push air above and
below the GPU tend to do poorly with GPU
cooling in our tests but a case like the
mesh of icy can scale up performance
with additional fans better because it
does have that mesh front
despite being not perfectly flat
rendering with blender on the CPU CPU
temperature during the test was thirty
nine degrees Celsius that's average
equal to the dark base pro 900 M between
the KL o 7h 500 P neither of which or
cases we praised for cooling the measure
Phi undefined
cases were slightly warmer than the 275
are here rendering on the GPU G via
temperature during the test was twenty
nine point six degrees Celsius that's
close to the define are six a case with
one more fan but it's also pretty close
to the age 500 P and stock mesh if I see
again but cooler than the stock define C
for once
and finally for noise 37.4 DBA is on the
same level as the spec oh four and two
seventy are with the stock fan
configuration at Matic speeds both
fellow Corsair cases with 120-millimeter
front mounted fans the front panel may
be sealed but it's still made of thin
plastic with open gaps on either side
more fans added to the front of this
case means more air trying to rush
through those narrow gaps which also
means more noise like the Silverstone
pmo to that we just reviewed the Corsair
275 are needs to justify its existence
against its own predecessor this is a
matter of course sir battling themselves
as Silverstone just did for the 270 are
in the conclusion of our review what we
said was this based on it's 60 to 70
dollar price point and assertive posture
against nearby competition we awarded it
an Editors Choice Award and we went on
to use it in our November budget build
in 2017 and in accidentally in 2016 as
well both years we didn't mean to use
the same case but we did because the
value was really good and 2017 it was
down to 50 bucks and even now it's 60
ish this case is $80 the acrylic version
is $70 the acrylic version changes even
less obviously than this one does from
the 275 are the change at that point is
this it not even just this it's it's
this it's the whole what you're getting
for $10 more is less plastic basically
or metal meshing or whatever other than
that it's relocated i/o and a slightly
longer power supply shroud these are not
things that you spend extra money for
over the two 7er which is still a great
case we still recommend it highly
so all that said then where does the 275
are stack up
well coarser has a history of dropping
their case prices slowly over time as
most companies do and over the course
the next year we wouldn't be surprised
to see this case followed by another $10
if it does it has now become the 270 are
and that case stops production or
maintains the same price be what worth
buying one of these I suppose but at $80
for the tempered glass version there are
a lot of cases in that price range that
can boast tempered glass now if that's
what you really want so this is becoming
a trend now with our last few reviews
for cases basically when it comes down
to is how much do you like the look of
this case versus other cases in the same
price range if you have your heart set
on this case and you really like it
there is nothing comically bad about it
like with other cases we've reviewed in
the past year it's not bad the case
itself is fine it has a few things we
didn't like obviously the tempered glass
can be the butt of a joke but
realistically you're not removing the
glass that much as much as I hate the
way it's installed and the test to the
choices to use the screws and the
grommets they did it's not that big of a
deal
so playing it up yes but that's not a
big deal so then ultimately there's
nothing terribly wrong with it the coins
not great it's okay if you're building
an $80 in an $80 case you're probably
building with budget components you're
not worrying about a 10 atti is worth of
heat not worrying about an 80 700k is
worth of heat so you have less thermal
concern in that department which means
that this configuration may well be fine
for the system you're building if you're
building something that is higher-end
then probably add fans to it just know
that with any case that has a panel like
this obviously you're gonna run into
limitations but this case is just fine
so it's kind of the trend lately it's
okay we'd like to see it cheaper it's
odd that courser is competing against a
270 are in some ways because it is
really a good case at its price and
that's why it's good the two-seven er is
specifically good because of its price
this loses that so at $80 we wouldn't
necessarily recommend it unless you
really like it in which case it's fine
don't feel bad about buying it but if
you want to look at other options there
are things that do everything a little
bit better the are l06 once again is the
best cool in its class and is actually a
little bit cheaper just realize that
it's like ten bucks cheaper the other
options Corsair zone 400 see if you're
willing to spend about $10 more that's a
great case it works pretty well
thermally from our testing it has some
build features and the ease of
installation features we liked a lot and
it's just a bit more expensive there are
plenty of other options as well we had
them in the charts if you're interested
in them or check Patrick's written
review in the article below or we'll
have a couple of extra discussion points
on this case and its competition so
that's all for this one basically it's
okay that subscribe for more as always
go to store that game as exits net to
pick up a shirt like this one this is
the GN 10-year anniversary edition shirt
and I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
