refill the enter max lick tax TR for 240
millimeter cooler this one to just see
if it's actually maintainable and
serviceable further in its life because
this is a high-end cooler that you're
putting on a high-end processor so you
might be using a workstation like that
for four or five years onward at that
point is when you start encountering
permeation issues tends to be about five
years that the liquid begins permeating
the tubes enough that you can lose some
performance you get air bubbles in the
tank where you could suck air through
the pump and all of those things create
noise create friction and things like
that
so we refilled it now we're testing to
see how the refill worked thermally
before that this video is brought to you
by thermal grizzly makers of the
conductor not liquid metal that we
recently used to drop 20 degrees off of
our temperatures thermal grizzly also
makes traditional thermal compounds we
use on top of the IHS like cryo not and
hydro not pastes learn more at the link
below for the first thing here there was
no increase in noise so fortunately we
were able to get all the liquid back
into the loop and that meant that the
pump noises that you hear kind of up
until the point that it's fully refilled
went away so it's actually the same
noise levels as before exactly and that
leaves us with just thermal performance
we're gonna start with those and get
that out of the way right now and then
come back and look at what could you do
if you were refilling your own loop of a
similar build to this one to improve on
what we did because that was a learning
process so now that we've gone through
it there's some clear things that we
could then it all benefit from looking
at in terms of filling the loop and
making sure that it is maintained for a
long service life in our prime95 test
that 100% fan speeds 4 gigahertz and
1.35 volts the aromatic SelectTech 240
CLC kept our 1950 ex at 49 point six
degrees over ambient and that's 40 die
that's about one degree lower than the
stock unit with the original coolant
this is very nearly within usually test
variants and we can declare these as
functionally equivalent in performance
there is no appreciable difference and
may
even be a slight performance uplift if
that the peak temperatures are similarly
distanced about one degree and the idle
temperatures are about the same
refilling the coolant did not hurt
performance and may have slightly aided
though it's not an appreciable uplift if
so blender is next this one is slightly
less stressful but does do AVX workloads
and it's more reliable in its load level
on CPUs and power consumption for this
one we're seeing a more confidently
measurable difference of about two
degrees Celsius between the original 240
and the refilled 240 and we're at forty
two point three degrees for the stock
test and forty for the refilled test
giving us two degrees even with highs
similarly distanced and there's some
room of course here for just variants
between tests we did remount this three
times for each test so that gives us an
average average all those passes and
that helps account for things like
thermal paste spread differences though
we use a graduated syringe and place a
known amount of compound on and then
spread it manually so it's pretty
consistent but still doing it multiple
times helps make sure that any potential
differences in how the compound was
spread can be accounted for and averaged
out that said we're really not that far
from test variation from margin of error
things like that from sensor reading
differences so functionally the same
which is really not bad because we
weren't going for better here we were
going for not worse
so we achieved it not worse and
technically in blender we saw two
degrees improvement which is outside of
error a bit so it looks like maybe a
slight performance uplift things to know
here the coolant we filled this with was
more parts distilled water than what was
probably in there originally we
originally had just stock with unit a
propylene glycol mixture that's what
pretty much all of these closed-loop
coolers come with we don't know the
exact mixture of a glycol versus
distilled water but it can go up to
forty percent it just kind of depends on
what the manufacturer is going for if
they're trying to store negative forty C
they're going to have a higher mixture
or higher percentage of glycol
so it depends on what they SPECT but we
were definitely under whatever was in
there and then we did have a light
amount of a biocide in there to help
with potential corrosion but I wouldn't
recommend necessarily using the Coulomb
that we use which is just from an ek kit
with an additive in the fluid you could
probably do something a bit better than
what we did but we're not we're not
worried about things like corrosion
right now because it's just a test of
can you refill it not how should you
refill it so it wasn't a tutorial but
yeah select your coolant carefully if
you do a refill and make sure it's got
some kind of bio site in it or something
to help with potential corrosion
concerns because what comes in their
stock has those chemicals in there so
you'll want to make sure you do as well
because I do mix metals with the screw
the and the cold plate and things like
that next thing here so what could we
improve on is probably the next main
part so I starting you know we refilled
this with just a just a measuring cup
basically and started with about two
hundred twenty milliliters the cooler
itself I believe has two hundred
millilitres in it almost exactly so
that's about what you'd want to put in
in terms of making sure more in making
sure the coolant gets in there faster
which is what we really could have used
when doing this ourselves probably get a
brake bleed kit so I realized that after
we did the whole refill that for my bike
repair I've got a bleed kit and that's a
really fat syringe that with four bikes
you would fill with the hydraulic fluid
and at the end of it there's a rubber
tube and that goes into the brakes the
tube before the kit I have is a bit too
small for what we were doing but if you
got one of those and got a rubber
stopper or something or just even a
rubber stopper then kind of taped it on
the what we'll call the fill port on the
enter max unit you'd be able to fill it
a bit faster and then you could just
kind of hold it up in the air inject and
let it go down the tubes so that would
be faster now we got the job done
and it worked fine at the end of the day
there's no pump noise it's technically
cooler than it was so it worked you can
do it faster with with something like
that though for the setup another thing
we considered but didn't do was filling
through the cold plate instead of the
the side screw holes so the reason we
didn't do that is because the concern of
once you fill the whole thing up how
much fluid more do we need to fill that
bottom chamber where we're gonna be
obviously closing it off with the cold
blade and then the other concern is with
one set of hands making sure you can
actually get the cold plate back on
without spilling any coolant while
holding everything but I think it
probably would be easier to fill through
the cold plate next time because then
you can more easily get all the coolant
down the tubes into the radiator and
then close it once it's pretty close to
fall you know pull the screw off the
side and then fill the rest through that
port that would probably be a bit easier
as well so those would be the
suggestions for improving if you wanted
to do this to yourself it was again not
a tutorial it was a learning process of
looking at how easy is it to actually
refill this thing if you wanted turns
out it's actually not bad even going
about it the way we did which is a brute
force method not terrible and
considering other units on the market
are more or less non refillable almost
entirely the animatics one definitely is
more serviceable for a long up time so
that's it for this one it worked pretty
well all things considered and you can
do it if you wanted to if things start
getting heavily permeated down the line
which you can basically tell by
listening for gurgling noises or
listening for the pump making any kind
of grinding noise that means there's
probably not as much liquid anymore or
it's pulling air through the loop so you
