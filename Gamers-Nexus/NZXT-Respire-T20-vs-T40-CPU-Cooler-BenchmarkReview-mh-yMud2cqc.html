nexus dotnet and today we're looking at
two new cpu coolers from NZXT their
aspire t20 and respire t40 i was able to
run several stress tests on these
coolers on my trusty nehalem core cpu
but before we get to the performance
results let's look at the specs both of
these units are targeted to be
budget-friendly cooling options with the
slightly smaller t20 marked at 30 bucks
and the t47 440 and both are also
mechanical air coolers that are equipped
with NZXT fans operating within a range
of 1,300 to 1800 RPM based upon cooling
demand by the cpu and they are respect
for 27 decibels to 34 decibels
respective to the RPM the stock fans
that ship with the coolers will push
49.3 CFM on the low setting and 68.8 CFM
on the high setting each cooler can fit
to 120 millimeter fans right a push-pull
configuration which is of course
designed to channel more air through the
hot lumina piping and cool things off
more quickly in theory we will test this
in the video as it goes on both units
have relatively standard copper heat
piping and aluminum heatsink designs
with the t20 exposing to 6 millimeter
copper heatpipes and 18 millimeter pipe
to the cpu for a total of three while
the t 40 exposes for total pipes to the
cpu all of which are eight millimeter
pipes so they're a little bit bigger and
there's one more the actual heat sinks
use aluminum fittings to spread the heat
and measure in at 40 millimetres depth
for the t20 and 60 millimetres depth for
the t40 so the t40 does give you quite a
bit more aluminum to sink all that heat
with each added fan will increase the
depth by 25 millimeters on average based
on your fan so do factor that in when
you're fitting your case the units are
fairly universal and their compatibility
which is very refreshing actually and
the shift product will include all of
the brackets for Intel's LGA 2011 1366
1155 1156 and 77 yeah 775 excuse me wow
it's been a long time since I have said
that CPU socket as all of those will fit
with the new coolers AMD will fit fm1
am3 am3+ am too and am too plus cpus so
either way
you can go back half a decade or more
and retrofit a CPU if you'd like to
that's all well and good but the
performance and build quality is really
what counts with these so I fitted both
of the stock coolers to my system and
tested them in a few configurations I
tried each product with the stock
thermal paste that ships with them which
has a thermal conductivity of 4 watts
per meter Kelvin as well as an txt
silver 6 aftermarket paste which has a
thermal conductivity of 5.3 watts per
meter Kelvin I then tried the T 40 with
a dual fan configuration just to see if
it made a noticeable impact on cooling
this was also done with aftermarket
paste for testing I used eight torture
threads on prime 95 with large FFTs for
testing and our testing methodology is
discussed in the full review links below
if you would like to read more about
that so my findings were pretty
straightforward everything is measured
in delta temperature over ambient so
ambient was 21 c that is factored out of
the temperatures for each of these
coolers for idle tests the t20 with
stock thermal paste ran at 1.5 celsius
hotter than the t 40 and under load the
t20 ran a massive 10 Celsius hotter than
the T for T the aftermarket thermal
compound brought temperatures down
considerably and we'll feed heavily into
my conclusion in a moment the t20 with
aftermarket thermal compound idled at
3.2 celsius hotter than the t48 idol and
the t20 underload ran at 2.1 celsius
hotter than the t 4t as a final note to
the performance section the t 40 with an
additional fan and aftermarket paste ran
one Celsius cooler at idle and three
Celsius cooler under load than the t 40
with only one fan and aftermarket paste
so a decent difference there but really
only relevant at the end of the day if
you're planning to really push that
overclocking barrier as it will give you
a small amount more Headroom for pushing
voltages just that much higher so as for
the cooling differences the temperature
differences i think a lot of it it can
be easily attributed to the fact that on
the t20 you have fewer heat pipes
exposed to the cpu than the t 4t of
course and also the t20 is significantly
harder to line up then the t 4t on top
of the cpu there's less surface area so
it's more vital that you
that you really get dead center with
that t20 as far as build quality goes
first I want to note the installation
process was a little bit more involved
and more painful than most cpu coolers
I've worked with though not terrible
because at the end of the day it's a
pretty cheap cpu cooler it's 30 or 40
bucks depending this this difficulty was
due to the two screw mounting bracket
design thats it's centrally across the
CPU it is quite easy for the cooler to
slide around while it's still being
screwed in due to this design which
means worst thermal paste distribution
and more involved time and effort so do
be careful when you're mounting it
because it will screw up your thermal
paste if it slides around the mounting
screws also and this is a bit more of an
issue than the previous one also shed
metal fibers when unscrewed and refitted
in my model this slightly concerns me
because if one of these fibers were to
in an unlikely scenario cross an
integrated circuit or bypass cap and
enters it or enter the psu I'd be
worried about a potential short that
said as long as you're careful
installing don't remove and reapply it
several times like I had to for these
tests and you're generally just careful
about watching where the the scraps are
going I don't think it'll be an issue
the chances of a short even with the
shavings are quite low but I do think
it's important to get out there so you
you're aware of the issue before you buy
it the performance is an exemplary but
it is still quite good at the price and
at such relatively low prices these
coolers do pose a great value option for
system builders who want to toy with
overclocking or better cooling on the
stock options the hyper 212 endowments
lower end products are as viable as ever
but with impending sales on NZXT
products they're well worth
consideration and from what I've been
told the CPU coolers could well be the
best price to performance option
available during times of large sales
without a sale though there are quite a
lot of other choices out there in this
range and they all perform equally well
some better some worse so that leaves
the T for T and t20 decidedly average
within their own price points if you're
picking strictly between the two units i
would encourage choosing the t 40 and
i'm tempted to discourage picking the
teach one e altogether given a mere ten
dollar difference for quite a large
performance difference i would also
highly recommend you
either higher quality thermal paste or
an additional fan as the results proved
to be worthwhile investments if you are
looking into overclocking if you're
running stock settings both are
irrelevant don't waste your money just
be careful about adding too much on to
the purpose purchase since another
fifteen or twenty dollars will put you
into the price range of higher pedigree
coolers at the end of the day they're
both decent products that will perform
just fine for most intermediate system
builders it'll outperform stock heat
sinks admirably and give you a great
launch point for overclocking but it's
still nothing mind-blowing so that's all
for this video I'll see you all next
time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
