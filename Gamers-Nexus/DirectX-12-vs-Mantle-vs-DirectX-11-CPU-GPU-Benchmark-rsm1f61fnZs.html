one of the most important topics in
gaming as it pertains to hardware we are
talking about API overhead and this is
the limiting factor when it comes to
hardware performance that's why our CPUs
and GPUs underperform versus what their
spec would otherwise suggest when it
comes to gaming api's are things like
DirectX 11 through X 12 and andy mantle
there all kinds of API is out in the
world but specifically for gaming these
are the three were talking about today
an API is an application programming
interface in the case of DX 1112 and
mantle it is what enables game
developers to hook into the hardware and
the operating system of the host
computer this makes their lives easier
for programming and it even enables
things like better backwards
compatibility on Hardware when you're
playing older games so DirectX 11 has a
very heavy overhead when it comes to
something called a draw call if you're
not familiar with us that it is a draw
call is effectively when the CPU asks
the GPU to draw a new object to the
screen or new geometry it is not
including things like shading and other
special effects lighting stuff like that
it's strictly geometry and object calls
to the GPU from the CPU this causes a
large bottleneck and one of the biggest
limiters in PC performance is the
bottleneck produced by API is in fact it
can be up to 10 times different with
DirectX 12 versus DirectX 11 the current
one that you're most likely all using
and we'll talk about this more in a
second so first of all it's worth noting
that AMD mantle is being phased out and
has been publicly stated by Andy's
developers that it is falling into
disuse they are urging game developers
to move to DirectX 12 as mantle is being
adapted into OpenGL and will effectively
be no longer used in its current state
drives X 12 is an API owned developed
and operated by Microsoft and it is
being phased in as DirectX 11 ages DX 12
offers great gains for performance
especially for CPUs this is the same as
mantle and this is a point of confusion
for a lot of people API is although
often associated with video cards are
not entirely GPU bound in fact an API
produces the largest overhead on low-end
CPUs so having a more efficient API like
mantle or DX 12 will actually allow you
to buy
and CPU like a quad core or dual core
CPU even the g3 two five eight will see
massive gains from an API like the x12
or mantle and the video card will take
on some of that load it shares a little
bit better with newer api's so in our
testing we see that DirectX 12 often has
a 10x draw call per second improvement
over DirectX 11 it's about on par with
mantle although mantle does outperform
its when using a quad core six core or
better CPU and dx12 outperforms mantle
when using something with more limited
threads like a g3 two five eight so in
these charts I'm showing you you'll see
a few different things you'll see two
variables for the CPU that's the g3 two
five eight which is a low-end seventy
dollar CPU from Intel and a 4790k
provided by CyberPower which is a
high-end hyper-threaded quad core Intel
CPU with eight threads so these are our
two CPUs these are where we'll see the
biggest difference in terms of
throttling with api's the GPU is we used
a 290x strictly because it is required
or similar for mantle and we used to
tighten X just because it's new and fun
to test I want to very heavily emphasize
that these tests are not comparable to
one another you cannot compare the 290x
to the Titan X in terms of draw calls
per second using this test it is not
built for that it is not built to
compare video cards it is strictly built
to compare api's and API performance
that BDX 11:12 and mantle so although
one video card may outperform the other
in some tests
you really can't look at it that way for
various reasons and one of the smaller
ones is that none of this is really
finalized yet it's all still in
development the other one is that this
test was built to test AP is that
disclaimer stated what we're looking at
here are draw calls per second so the
draw calls per second will slowly stack
up in the test as the CPU and GPU get
loaded and once the framerate finally
drops below 30 fps you will see the the
test stops so once it hits 30 FPS it's
concluded and the results are in so we
count the number of draw calls made in
the thousands and millions
and then and then put that in these
charts so what you're looking at is the
draw calls per second made by each API
and it is measured in thousands here so
if you see the number 712 that's seven
hundred twelve thousand and likewise for
the items in the millions
so with direct x12 and mantle were often
using a 4790k hitting in excess of 14 15
18 million draw calls per second using
the newer api's and this is a massive
gain / DirectX 11 so you can see why
everyone's so excited about the new API
is because it will effectively unlock
potential in your hardware that you
weren't able to take advantage of before
because of the overhead produced by
these during draw calls in other tests
using the g3 - 5/8 as you can see in
these charts the the gains are almost 10
X or greater in some cases and that's
because the the CPU is so thread limited
with our low-end CPU that moving any
amount of load from it to the GPU has a
huge impact so the takeaway here is that
DirectX 12 is very important to the
world of gaming mantle is dead forget
about mantle it's shown here for
comparison purposes with the other api's
but it will effectively be defunct by
the time DirectX 12 ships no game
developers that are noteworthy are using
it going forward it is being deprecated
DirectX 12 is critical to the
advancement of hardware utilization and
you can see that in these results pretty
exciting stuff if you want to run this
test yourself you can check out our
article linked in the description below
I ran the whole test I described some
very brief technical detail on how draw
calls work and where the bottlenecks are
and how you can run the tests yourself
you need to use Windows 10 a preview so
that is all for this test please check
out the channel subscribe if you like
this content we're getting heavy into
the hardware analytical content these
days so we want you coming back to check
it out really helps us out of you
subscribe and I will see you all next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
