abandoned parking lot with this the
Coolermaster h 500 p you may be aware
that coolermaster is coming out with an
h 500 p mesh this new case actually
involves many of our criticism
suggestions and Coolermaster though
didn't send us an aged 500 p mesh can't
blame them they've probably seen enough
of us frankly and so we're shooting a
special edition for this review of the H
500 B mesh review I'll be coming out in
the next few days we're waiting for
hours to arrive via probably retail
channels and the video will include a
couple cool I don't know it's just gonna
be kind of a semi cinematic thing we'll
have some shots we can tease for you in
this video and probably have been thus
far but we're taking a cue from the very
warm reception by the way thank you of
our disappointment PC build and we
decided we'd shoot something cool and
special for the h5 hundred B mesh it
really deserves it I mean it doesn't
matter whether the case will be good or
bad at this point I don't know but the
me in about two days will now and it
doesn't matter if it's good or bad it
deserves a special video because that
case has been monumental for us I mean
that case is what you got us in front of
a lot of people for our critical case
reviews so we'll have that for you soon
we wanted to shoot this very quick
behind-the-scenes video and just show
you a little bit of what we've been
working on we have some clips of it so
this is really just a teaser we wanted
to get everyone interested in what we're
working on our review might be a day or
two later than everyone else's but I can
assure you that it will be very in-depth
and very thorough we'll be looking over
everything coolermaster is done for the
New Age 500 B mesh and you can check
that out on the channel soon so
subscribe to make sure you catch the
content when it goes live and as always
thank you for watching you go to
