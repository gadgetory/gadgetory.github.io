hardware news episode and Vidya decided
that launching two video cards in one
month wasn't enough so the r-tx 2070 is
on the way and also regarding RAM prices
if you thought price fixing wasn't a
thing we'll be talking about that more
today as well
further AMD there are rumors of a
Polaris revisit a revisit of Polaris
there's an ampere computing unveil but
it's not the one that you might remember
from Nvidia and we have plenty of other
news items for this week as well before
that this video is brought to you by
power colors rx 588 gigabyte card which
is marked down to $200 with rebate
starting September 29th on new egg and
that is for the 8 gigabyte model if
you're looking for a mid-range video
card for gaming on high settings
consider power colors 8 gigabyte rx 580
that we linked below the card also comes
with three free games including
Assassin's Creed Odyssey star control
and Strange Brigade while supplies last
learn more at the link below so the
first major news item of course is us
we're gearing up for a rip j2 or it
might be three by the time this video
goes up Jay responded on Twitter to our
beating of his time spy extreme score
with envy linked GPUs and he beat ours
by about a hundred more times by extreme
points so we're gonna retaliate to that
first of all the immediate goal is to do
some memory overclocking timings tuning
stuff like that and see can I beat his
score with just what we have without
further modification and then because I
know he will definitely respond to that
because he hooked up his test bench to
an AC unit directly we are we've got a
bunch of gear so memory module cooling
for example takes up some more water
blocks so we can put the GPUs properly
under water this time and stuff like
that so this this battle is far from
over it'll be a lot of fun and of course
thank you to Jay for joining I think
Paul picked up his bridges as well so he
might join in too but either way keep an
eye out for that the immediate responses
have been via Twitter but will of course
bring them to video as soon as we get
the scores up they're just a lot of
other stuff going on first like waiting
for shipping to retaliate properly to
Jay so first major news
Samson is looking to possibly limit its
production which would help maintain
high prices on memory Samson is now
anticipating demand to be less than
originally expected for DRAM and NAND
with bit growth being lower than
originally forecast
Samson fears demand will soften as the
market could reach oversupply and in
order to shore up high prices Bloomberg
says that Samson couldn't cut back on
production of chips to keep supply tight
and thus price is favorable for them
anyway there continues to be speculation
of the market being somewhat inundated
with DRAM finally as smartphone sales
slowed and laptop shipments are expected
to be interrupted if Samson makes moves
to curtail production and augment supply
SK Hynix and micron it could very well
follow suit which would keep memory
prices high into the foreseeable future
and there's been some discussion on
potential price fixing in the memory
market nothing's been firmly proven yet
but there have been legal complaints
filed in the US and then in China
there's an active investigation by a
branch with the Chinese government so
are still waiting to hear back on that
it'll be a while it's a slow progress
process but that's been something that
has been discussed in the past and
certainly this would feed into the
theories that there might be some price
fixing afoot ampere computing so this is
if you remember before Turing the
rumored name of NVIDIA GPU is ampere and
that never happened it might in the
future we don't know but it's not a bean
taurine so what we know now though is
that Intel president Rene James launched
her own semiconductor business which is
called ampere computing and it's
unveiling an emag processor and a new
roadmap coming up that target
specifically ARM based server chips so
this is beneficial and offering lower
power consumption and security benefits
over the compromised x86 chips that are
out now
ie spectra and meltdown and to this end
amperes already unveiled its emag
processor and a future roadmap the first
batch of CPUs come in 16 and 32 core
variants and the company has already
picked up two major customers one of
which means Microsoft and the other
being Lenovo these CPUs should start
about $550 a 16-core model and about 850
for the 32 courtship these are not
consumer CPUs but we wanted to bring
them up because it's an important
development in the market especially
given all the reporting that everyone's
done on spectra in meltdown because
these are somewhat directly related to
bypassing those concerns and this uses
arm the 8a core is built on 60
nanometers FinFET process from TSM see
if you're curious about that so it
should be low power and security
benefits over x86 which will compete
directly with both Intel and AMD in the
server markets a post on chip pal
recently indicated a move to Polaris 30
on 12 nanometer tsmc silicon if the
rumour holds true there would be
potential for down costed versions of
the rx 580 cards with potential power
consumption improvements depending on
how much AMD pushes the clocks if at all
ver√≥nica the leading benchmarking site
for hardware on linux noticed a new
polaris device ID in a recent kernel
patch this is interesting timing for AMD
to capitalize on a market that has
rebelled against the new flagship cards
from Nvidia of course but it must still
compete with the remaining Pascale stock
in the 1060 class they give it the sixes
held strong against the 1070 cards it
just has never really been available
until recently thanks to the mining boom
and now bust but it does look like
Polaris could be returning for a
reprisal of the mid-range market role
next up Nvidia publicly announced the
r-tx 2070 to launch on October 17th and
declared an MSRP of $500 for partner
models or 600 for the EFI card we're
curious to see the lowest price of
partner models that pop up but it does
look like the EFI card uses the same
external ID as the other 20 series
releases the shroud is identical just
the cooler might be different we would
guess that most good partner models will
end up around $600 but don't have firm
pricing just yet the RT X 2070 will use
a new tu 106 package rather than being a
cut-down version of the r-tx 28 es die
and we also don't know the die size on
that but it has been officially
announced by Nvidia for October 17th if
you didn't have enough from the other 20
series cards separately it appears as if
Nvidia has announced its founders
Edition customers a second delay in our
TX 28 eti orders the new arrival date
has been put
to October 5th to 9th although some
customers will receive them earlier than
that arrival is based upon supply of the
card and the also back in the news for a
risin Raven Ridge APU lineup launch this
one's aimed at high-end gaming laptops
moving away from desktops or bonum
moment so the risin are 720 800 H and r5
2608 are the new AP use they are for
core 8 thread parts both offering a
configurable TDP in the range of 30 4
watts to 54 watts depending on what the
partner making the laptop wants to
achieve the r7 2800 H offers Vega 11
Radeon graphics and it's also got 11 C
use for that to compute units which
would be the container for the streaming
processors and there's a bass or boost
of 3.3 to 3.8 gigahertz on the CPU
meanwhile the r5 2600 H comes equipped
with Vega 8 graphics and that one runs
8c use as indicated by the name there's
no word yet on availability or what
price what price we should expect for
the laptops with the AP is but we do
know that they're coming out sometime in
the near future
it looks like Andy could be facing a
shortage with its a320 and B 450
motherboards into also although we
haven't heard of this one while the a 68
series of motherboards to a much lesser
extent
so this problem seems to be mostly
limited to the China market right now
and the demand here for Andy's
entry-level boards is strong enough that
it is helping to create or at least
exacerbate this shortage the increase in
demand for entry-level boards is partly
stemming from bundling deals going on
right now and that would again include
the vendors of those chipsets so 8
through 20 be for 50 and a 68 are mostly
affecting the asus gigabyte in msi
low-end boards right now and those are
the ones that are most impacted by this
shortage so to keep prices stable and
mitigate the shortages the affected
vendors have canceled current bundling
promotions and asus has plans for
production expansion to help meet the
demand of those entry-level boards right
now also dealing with shortages is still
Intel and talking about this for
actually a couple of months now but
Intel has been facing issues with their
10 nanometer process production of
course and then the 14 nanometer process
is now being used more
heavily because they need something and
it's not ten nanometer so that means
that the lower-end chipsets are now
eating away at the node that is required
for making CPUs at this point so Intel
is moving its H 310 chipset back to 22
nanometers from 14 so I can then relieve
that fab space for CPU production and
this means that the H 310 motherboard
will be using an older process although
the effects or importance of that is
questionable just considering that it is
an extremely low on part the new H 310
chipset new in quotes will be known as
the H 310 C so it will be marked
differently and it's expected to
eventually replace existing product SKUs
using the vanilla 14 nanometer H 310
chipset speaking of this Intel is
looking at expanding its 40 nanometer
production testing facilities because of
the 40 nanometer bottleneck they're
facing right now just in terms of
availability product supply so our
favorite website Tom's hardware and
writer Paula Alcorn who we've actually
met and is a great reporter in the space
wrote this article about Intel expanding
its testing facilities and dealing with
this new supply issue so install has
several 4,900 products in the pipeline
simultaneously they've got coffee like
for example they have chipset they have
coffee like it refresh they have whiskey
like they have amber Lake they really
really like bodies of water at Intel and
then they also have X mm 775 60 models
for Apple's iPhones I'm on other things
so these documents obtained by Tom's
Hardware suggested that the testing
capacity is as much of the problem as
the fab space at this point even though
all indications previously have pointed
toward fab space limitations so to
hopefully alleviate this problem the
documents detail plans for some of
Intel's 14 nanometer silicon to be sent
to facilities in Vietnam for testing
where the testing will be done under
Intel's quote copy exactly exclamation
point program this program allows for
processes like testing packaging and
production to be replicated
theoretically perfectly it just will be
done somewhere else and that should
hopefully help Intel out going forward
with their provide
and supply limitations we had a lot of
smaller news items to go over this week
as well so in rapid-fire format let's go
over a few of them EK water blocks
announced the successor to their
venerable EK supremacy CP water block
and that is the EK velocity the velocity
will come in fourteen different models
all supporting EK WB's fifth iteration
of their cooling design among the
changes are a new mounting bracket fewer
flow restrictions and more uniform RGB
implementation prices range from ninety
seven dollars to one hundred thirty five
dollars and they are expected to ship by
October first fractal has released
tempered glass window kits aimed at
users wanting to get in on the trend and
replace their acrylic windows the
tempered glass windows will be offered
in two different kits and those are for
the fractal define r5 and the defined s
both of which will now have tempered
glass options new AG recently revealed
that from the dates of August 13th 2018
to September 18th 2018 they were
affected by a malware attack
orchestrated by mage cart the online
attack group recently known for
attacking Ticketmaster and British
Airways the newer attack was done by
redirecting users to a mage cart server
disguised as new expand processing page
where malicious JavaScript ran on the
backend acting like a card skimmer and
acquiring payment details such as names
addresses and card details this
disguised domain even had a fake
certificate given to create the
impression of legitimacy Newegg has
since acknowledged the vulnerability and
has emailed customers whom they believe
to be affected Newegg is currently
investigating the attack and if any of
our readers or viewers shopped on new AG
between August 13th and September 18th
of this year you should immediately get
in touch with your card issuer or bank
to get new cards issued alternatively
it's all a great big scheme because new
AG sees all the prices rising Ram
vendors are benefiting video card
vendors are benefiting and they said we
really need more money
how can we do it and that was the
solution so either way they were
effective they admitted it and
definitely get in touch with your banks
or card issuers so that you're not
adversely affected yourself hardware
sales for the week Ram prices this is
actually if you normally skip this
segment this one's actually worth
listening to because Ram prices are
expected to slide downwards through
fourth quarter of 2018 against initial
predictions and even into 2019 and this
is despite the first news item talking
about Samsung Protection potentially
intentionally limiting their supply of
memory so we don't know how that's gonna
affect things yet but if you look at
prices right now RAM is finally coming
down just to just a tiny bit and the
demand is somewhat flatlined in the
desktop enthusiast space the really
expensive r-tx card certainly don't help
that because the amount of the
attachment rate to brand-new system
builds will be lower overall and that
could benefit us all if the RAM prices
can come down a little bit so this is
assuming that memory makers don't start
decelerating their memory production as
Samsung might be doing as indicated by
Bloomberg previously so still the past
week has netted some price dips and RAM
kits generally 16 gigabyte ddr4 kits
with frequencies in excess of 3,000
megahertz has stayed north of $150 and
we've seen a few kits slide it below
that finally like there's for example a
team t4 16 gigabyte 3,000 megahertz kit
for $130 there's a g.skill ripjaws kit
for 135 and that's 32 hundred megahertz
and there's a team Volken kit for $120
with a promo and of course those prices
move around all the time but the idea is
even if those exact deals aren't still
up by the time this video is it might be
worth looking around at RAM again if
it's been a while because it's kind of
coming down so that's it for this week
