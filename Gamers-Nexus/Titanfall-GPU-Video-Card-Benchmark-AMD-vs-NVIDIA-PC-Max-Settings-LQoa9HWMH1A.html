nexus da net and today we are
benchmarking titan falls performance on
multiple video cards i already published
this full article linked in the
description below hit that if you want
more information but this is sort of the
video component to show you what the
game actually looks like on various
settings just for your own curiosity we
previously benchmarked the performance
in titan falls beta but that was before
official drivers were released for the
cards to support different profiles and
it was of course before the game was
finalized so i revisited it now that the
game is final to kind of give you an
update on how different cards perform
the cards were testing today include ex
FX's ghost 7850 1 gigabyte card a GTX
650 TI boost 2 gigabyte card courtesy of
Fred shout out to Fred and AMD a10 5800
k apu which has a 76 60d GPU component a
gtx 760 2 gigabyte card and then we've
got four more three of them by msi the
first is a gtx 750 one gigabyte card
which uses the new maxwell architecture
it's the 28 nanometer version of maxwell
there's an msi r7 260x 2 gigabyte card
and an MSI r9 270x 2 gigabyte card which
is one of the most expensive ones right
now especially with the cryptocurrency
boom the last card is my old gtx 580
which i suspect has there is something
weird with the 580 in this test so if
you have your own 580 please tell me
what your results are but we'll get to
that in a moment I tested the game using
these settings it's pretty maxed out
there has been some criticism online of
my use of 8x msaa anti-aliasing which is
totally valid you probably don't want to
use that in a real-world scenario so I
will grant that and in the future we
will do multiple tests with maxaa and
with a lower a like 4x or 2x but this is
what I tested with so that's what we got
everything set the high texture
resolution is set to insane and it is
double buffered so we we can actually
push 120 fps to the 120 Hertz monitor if
the card is capable because the game
will limit your frame rate based on the
frequency of the monitor and based on
your vsync settings this will allow you
to output
higher framerate to a high frequency
monitor so that's what we got now the
810 5800 k and intel HD 4000 i didn't
mention the HD 4000 both of those were
tested with different settings shown
here the HD 4000 I had to further
decrease to 900 p because 1080 was just
too much for it man it just couldn't do
it I ran five test iterations for each
device and I ran them all largely on the
same maps as the other tests we did not
test on Lagoon because there was some
framerate drop issues so that map was
eliminated in order to normalize the
results but other than that everything
was pretty constant what you're looking
at in terms of this chart is the average
FPS that's the blue bar that's the one
you care most about the minimum FPS
which is the absolute lowest point and
then the one percent time low FPS so
here's why I include that with minimum
FPS you may very well just be getting an
outlier right just like with the maximum
FPS I actually did not include max FPS
because it's kind of silly you'll end up
with outliers or you just end up 120 all
the time with some of these cards
because it's really not hard to push 120
FPS at some point in the gaming process
when that's your maximum FPS possible
with the game and the monitor the one
percent time low is FPS that is output
one percent of the time so that would be
a pretty good representation of your lag
spikes over the course of a minute
you'll see one percent is low enough
where you'll see those spikes those
drops and and it's it's it's definitely
worth looking at here what we have in
terms of results will start at the very
bottom with the HD 4000 unlike beta the
HD 4000 was actually able to play
titanfall so that's a pretty big
difference because in beta it was
totally unable to play the game had
serious will call them artifacting and
mash Therrien issues if you're a game
developer please feel free to correct me
on the use of those terms the HD 4000
this time at 900p with the low settings
that i showed put out 16 FPS at best at
average I should say it was 60 max but
again that was in the outlier with 1080p
it was closer to 10 FPS if we're
generous it was actually like nine point
four I think so definitely not a viable
option just using the HD 4000 alone you
would need to run a 13 by 7 f resolution
or something to even get a reasonable
FPS the AMD a10 50 100 k is trinity it's
a couple generations old and was
actually i think maybe the first desktop
apu off the top of my head and so it has
the 76th 60d in it which is it was
pretty damn impressive for its time and
it's still impressive in titanfall I was
really quite shocked to see that it
averaged 33 FPS that's that's fairly
playable I know a lot of you more
serious gamers myself included I can't
play less than 60 FPS it drives me crazy
but being realistic here if you have an
810 5800 k you're on a budget already
and 33 is totally playable it's it's
fine it's not the most fluid thing in
the world you might see a couple jobs
but it does look pretty damn good given
that the APU was like I don't know 150
bucks or whatever when it was brand new
so then we have the gtx 580 this is the
one I said should maybe maybe be
discarded just because it's it's a bit
odd it should not perform this low it
should probably be close it should
probably be above the 650 Ti boost
almost assuredly so here's the thing the
580 that I used to test works perfectly
fine and other games that I validated it
with I was concerned about the health of
the card after I saw these results so I
did test it with other games and it
performed where it should relative to
these other devices so I don't know
what's going on with titanfall and the
580 that I have I have an old EVGA 1.5
gigabyte one but they're not happy
playing together so it just kind of keep
that in mind year 580 may perform better
if you have one please test it and let
me know below the GTX 750 is a new
Maxwell architecture card it's on 28
nanometer version of Maxwell and it
performed really I mean it really
impressed me I was blown away by its
consistency here so if you have a 750 or
if you have like a
and thirty one hundred forty dollar
budget this is something worth
considering because I one gigabyte 750
with maxaa with max everything with
insane textures had an average FPS of 49
and a one-percent low of 26.8 so if you
drop MSA a if you drop to maybe like 2x
or 4x if you drop texture resolution to
very high from insane you're going to
play this game just fine with the card I
also noted in the in the benchmark
article that this was one of the
smoothest devices in terms of the actual
frame times in terms of stuttering
that's probably partly because it's
maxwell and has some improvements on
those fronts but it does perform very
well the 7850 similarly did pretty well
was 49.8 average and i pretty much same
stuff i said previously doesn't doesn't
have any noticeable tearing issues or at
least not frequently the GTX 650 Ti
boost two gigabyte model way
outperformed everyone else in terms of
consistency it was the most consistent
device on the bench in that it had a
very high minimum and a very high 1% low
that weren't too distant from its
average of fifty-one FPS very smooth
card and played the game quite
reasonably at high settings or max
settings in this case the r7 260x
performed a little bit better than that
no visible issues with tearing that were
noteworthy same for the 270x and that
that is starting to the high end so you
can probably start running things like
fraps or screen capture software with
this card and with the 760 and you'll
still get away with a reasonable frame
rate even with that software running the
GTX 760 performed just as well as we
would expect it was 80 1.75 FPS average
it actually outperformed itself in the
beta benchmark which is a good thing
because that shows there were some
optimization improvements either on the
driver side or on the game side and it
is a it did have some visible stuttering
issues I had stuttering issues even on
high resolution textures or very high i
should say so it was not an issue with
the ram cashing out it's just some issue
with the card and other people have
noticed this
online as well so that's our titanfall
benchmark please hit the link in the
