thana and this is our benchmark course
for overwatch blizzards new team shooter
this game was in beta again this weekend
we had access to it and we decided to do
a GPU benchmark so what you're looking
at is the course used to determine how
intensive the game is on GPUs from the
750 Ti the 270x the 380 X all the way up
to the 9 ATI and everything in between
so the course is 30 seconds long as
always we repeat it several times for
parody on each card each configuration
we tested at max settings which is about
what you're looking at you're looking at
that at 1080 running max settings at 4k
is pretty abusive on the system you can
find the results already published on
the website so it's all published there
there's a link in the description below
if you want the charts and the FPS data
but I'm sure we'll make a video at some
point also we had a lot of interesting
findings with overwatch it's all
published in the article but the main
thing here is if you are playing this
game render scale is something that you
probably want to run on high render
scale will tank your performance and the
reason for that is because as the name
suggests all it does is super sample or
down sample the resolution of the games
rendered output so if you choose epic
and you're running a 1080 display that's
effectively a 4k resolution that you're
rendering to the screen even though you
have a 1080 display if you choose high
that's 100% that means whatever your
resolution is natively that's what the
game is rendering on the screen and
that's what we would recommend using
that's what we used for most or tests so
that's the big thing
dynamic shadows also had some
interesting performance hits and again
all that's detailed in the article but
we will try and make a video for this so
that's all for this quick benchmark
course some maximum graphics overwatch
gameplay things like that check the
website as always hit that patreon link
in the post roll video if you want to
help us out directly and thanks again
for watching I really do appreciate the
viewership and we're having a lot of fun
building the site and producing the
videos in the articles so thank you for
making that possible and for enjoying
the content as much as we do I will see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
