access tonight and we're back with
another episode of ask GN where we
answer your questions so if you have
questions for next episode post them
below we'll get to a couple of them and
see what we can learn for this week
we're gonna start off with some CPU
stuff and this question is from uh - I
think Anthony is that it asks I was
always wondering is hyper-threading
software and does that mean every CP
user to have it as it stands now I don't
like hyper threading it's an elite CPU
thin and that's why it's not supported
because it's a niche thin how can we get
more CPU CPU cores to organize threads
better and be a bit across all CP ran so
first of all a couple things here hyper
threading is part of something called
simultaneous multi-threading or SMT that
word hyper threading is specifically
intel's implementation of SMT and Andy
can do it as well do they just don't
call it hyper threading with that stated
does every CPU have it should at all
should every CPU have it not necessarily
hyper threading is not software as was
sort of asked here it is on the hardware
level it's sort of a switch that in
Intel's case they can throw the switch
but there's additional validation that
needs to be performed so that does add
to cost and in terms of being the
so-called elite CPU thing I guess that
depends on your perspective but there's
definitely uses for hyper threading and
places where you wouldn't want to use it
and in some gaming scenarios there's
really no gain at all and actually we've
seen maybe one FPS advantage non hyper
threaded equivalent CPU is if their
clocks the same and then in other cases
like video production you see actually
pretty big gains from having extra
thread so it depends less on the CPU
this is answer the last part of the
question saying how do we get CPU cores
to organize the threads better that's
not really where the problem is the
problem is on the software organizing
the threads and assigning threads or
tasks to different threads so with hyper
threading say you have a fork or CPU
with eight threads Windows just sees
eight threads it doesn't really care how
many cores they're all are all it knows
is that there's eight threads and maybe
CryEngine says let's use six of those
for a game logic game
I game rendering physics and two other a
couple other things if that happens
it'll just task out those items to the
threads as appropriate as they're
defined within the software the game
engine windows etc and that's not really
on the CPU side the CPU doesn't go
seeking for things to assign itself it
needs to be told what to do at some
level by the host even though the CPU
does control everything ultimately at
the end of the day so that hopefully
answers part of that question as for
hyper-threading not being supported
because it's a niche thing that same
thing there hyper-threading isn't really
something that is explicitly supported
or not supported it's just the usage of
threads and how many threads can be
utilized or spawned by the game engines
and the software not really so much on
the hardware side more entirely on the
software side so that stated a couple
things to sort of wrap this question
hyper-threading is part of SMT or
simultaneous multi-threading and thee
does this thing where they they're
modules for their older architectures
and some of the current architectures
they'll run sort of a wone module with
maybe one FP or floating-point
processing unit and then a couple of
integer units or a L use and that's sort
of their version of SMT depending on
Intel and a.m. these definitions of
threads or cores they define them a
little bit differently between their
architectures so that's important to
note as well it's not really a linear
comparison core to core for these two
different architectures between Intel
and AMD because they define them
differently right now next question is
from Andika who asks right now both AMD
and Intel are integrating better and
better graphics hardware on their CPUs
definitely true do you think this trend
will continue in the future how far are
we from VR capable eye GPUs or
integrated graphics processors so
starting with the VR question I'm not
really sure how far away we are it
depends on how VR evolves and what you
define as VR capable because of course
there can be lower requirement VR
applications that aren't as high render
quality but
I was who are definitely a little ways
off right now they're not a GPS aren't
that powerful right now it'll be a
little while they might be able to run
some VR applications or VR desktops but
running sort of VR games we're a bit
away from that now in terms of
integrating better graphics hardware
this is pretty interesting and maybe not
where the question was intended to go
but yes the trend will continue and the
interesting part of that is because GPUs
are almost sort of replacing CPUs in a
lot of ways CPU will stick around but
the importance of the GPU has grown
tremendously over the last few years and
a lot of that is the api's that are
being used and the ability to sort of
push processes or tasks to the GPU
rather than the CPU GPU being parallel
so it can handle things better when
there's a lot going on at once and as
AMD is a good example here as these
different processing architectures grow
and Intel and AMD build to enable their
IGP is to handle some of the basic
processing tasks within any post
environment the importance of GPUs will
continue to grow CPUs will continue to
assign more die space to their GPUs and
that's I think where we're gonna see a
lot of the advanced and in the immediate
future for CPU architectures next
question is from Ronaldo who says what
are your thoughts on Nix gaming so I
think we address this in one of the
first ask GN episodes the thing with
Linux gaming is it is very interesting
and I was really hoping that steams OS
would sort of build this Linux gaming
community and it has it's definitely
built up an ecosystem where now
developers have some level of support
from a major publisher valve where they
can get either financial or programming
support to support Linux so that's
definitely grown and that's a good thing
but steam OS did sort of fall off a
cliff it's not really as visible as it
was intending to be I think steam
machines lot of height for them they've
kind of disappeared now so I'm not
really sure what they're doing with that
or what their plans are for the
immediate future but it does
t-mike it's kind of hibernated in terms
of linux gaming in general of course you
don't need steamos to do life game it's
it's very important I think especially
as Windows sort of has historically
alienated some of its user base with
different moves that Microsoft's making
but you've got all these driver issues
you have software support issues so it's
it's not really gonna take off until
more people start adopting Linux and
developers can internally justify their
expense to build on their development
cost and port or support Linux and of
course the drivers are also an issue so
my thoughts on it purely from sort of an
industry standpoint Linux is incredibly
important we build our servers on it
it's important for competition in the
market it's important for offering a
free solution if you don't need Windows
or don't want it but it's not entirely
there yet for gaming of course to get it
there though it needs users so sort of a
catch-22 in that regard last question is
from Ron Mo's who is asking about dx12
again we have more dx12 content every
week and Ron says what are your thoughts
about dx12 in Nvidia they seem to do bad
lately and dx12 tests due to their
proprietary middleware game works I
believe so
first of all game works is not the
reason that they have some poor
performance and dx12 benchmarks that's
that's sort of just completely unrelated
the reason that the performance is the
way they looks is because the
architecture is on a hardware level so
and vidya doesn't do the sort of same
processing architecture that AMD does
where Andy has asynchronous compute
engines and those are used to
asynchronously queue up tasks we've
talked about this a lot in the past
video so leave those for more discussion
on that but asynchronously queues tasks
which was built sort of for mantle and
mantle is really very similar to dx12 at
a top level
so Andy's good at that type of
processing where things can get queued
up without building and waiting on other
tasks in the pipe and video doesn't do
it the same way and that's something
we'll talk about more as Pascal begins
to continue weekend
the information I'll start talking about
GPU architectures and how the build or
the pipeline for GPUs and the rendering
pipeline impacts performance in dx12 and
other api's but it's really not to do
with game works it's just to do with the
hardware architecture so that is all for
