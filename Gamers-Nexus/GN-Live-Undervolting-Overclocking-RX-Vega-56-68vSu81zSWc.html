momentarily today we are doing a Vega
undervolt in an overclocking demo to
walk you through some of the stuff that
we encountered during the review process
but I'm gonna give everyone a couple
minutes to fill in to the chat here so
hang tight with us while chat fills up
we've got a pretty cool street mean set
up I'll know it before I get into this
and by pretty cool I mean haphazard
dangerous to exist in here and takes up
a lot of space so we have a screen over
here that's for the under bolting and
stuff like that and we have a screen on
the other side which is just for the
actual stream output so the system
itself I don't know how visible it will
be without much light on it but there's
the system with the Vega card off to the
side and that's what we're going to be
undervolt in today okay so let me just
check chat see how everything is going
is every does everything seem okay to
everyone we tested it before going live
so I think we should be okay
looks okay no one's complaining yet so
yeah all right cool as a note Zeta is in
here as a moderator thank he's ADA for
helping out if you have questions post
them in chat I will try to read them
he'll kind of catalogue them for me and
we'll go back through every few minutes
and address all the questions and it
looks like everything's okay with the
stream so all right so here's what we're
gonna do we're gonna under vote Vega a
bit live part of the reason for this
demo is because during the process of
working with this thing during the
review we encountered there were a lot
of issues so part of this will show like
hey this is not a perfect solution right
now sometimes it works sometimes it
doesn't work sometimes it resets itself
sometimes the clocks misreport there are
a lot of potential challenges and
showing it live will help you see the
unedited just know things we encounter
along the way hopefully drivers will be
updated to fix some of this in the near
future and we we know there's a new
driver out we have the latest press
version on here that was sent out prior
to review going live and that was it was
not it did not contain the best gaming
optimizations what we were told there's
another driver for that but if you
wanted to overclock and actually test
your overclock so yeah these are
separate one which we did use and as the
under volting capabilities so that's
kind of filling up now so I think we can
get started on this doing behind in
benchmark now someone says hello Andrew
though so acknowledging the camera
operator that's always a good thing so
let's get started I think Andrew showed
the video card a moment ago
this is watt man watt man is pretty
buggy right now but it kind of works
what we're doing
this is afterburner afterburner does
it's not really report properly however
this clock is correct from what I've
been told so even though it looks crazy
small that is a correct clock rate and
then the other tool we're gonna use is
called watt tool which I find to be much
more reliable than watt man but here's
what we're gonna do first I'm just gonna
run a looping firestrike demo in the
background for right now and this thing
right here is this an old
phone I have set up which is
communicating with our current clamp so
I think let me see that is showing up
okay cool so that right now we're
reading about one app DC current and
that's a twelve point three volts so not
too much right now
so we're going to leave that hooked up
and this will be monitoring the power
consumption at the PCIe cables for the
RX Vega 56 video card which we have
connected right now and that means that
as the card ramps into its workload
we're gonna see that number increase and
the goal here is to bring down the power
consumption as much as we can while also
offsetting the power target so
increasing the power target by 50% means
that we are going to increase power
consumption to the tune of I think it's
like 90 watts off the top of my head but
it is in the review so going from the
zero percent offset the 50 percent
offset means we're probably gonna go to
about three hundred watts at the PCIe
cables at which point we start
encountering a BIOS lock and we did try
to flash and get around that we flash
successfully but it doesn't boot so it's
no good right now on the bypassing that
limitation so increasing power offset
increases our power consumption and
performance because the clock can
stabilize better but we can down volt
under voltage and actually improve the
clock stability by decreasing power and
in the process decrease power
consumption as you would expect so
here's what we got we got fire strike is
running successfully afterburner is not
reliable I'm gonna show you why see this
clock 1300 megahertz
probably not accurate what does watt man
think we're at right now
well maybe it's hard to say quite
frankly it is this is part of the
demonstration is showing that the clock
is known to be buggy we've talked to
Andy about it they know it's hard to
know when it's actually reporting
accurately but if we go down to let's
get listen to custom mode so if we go
down here we've got a 1537 for our
target frequency at DP m6 and clearly
it's not reporting that number
but that doesn't mean it's not happening
because what you need to do is validate
with performance not validate with these
numbers because those are often wrong
right now that should be fixed
so when overclocking validate with
performance which means run a test first
run a test after the OC if performance
improves that means that you've
obviously overclocked it if it doesn't
there's a problem so let's look at the
current here we are currently at 16 ish
amps and that's going to be our baseline
for stock so 16 apps baseline stock is
what we're gonna try and stick near and
then if we I'm just gonna do a demo here
if we set the power limit to an offset
of 50 you're able to see that we tried
to screen capture by the way but it was
too uh too complicated for right now so
power is offset by 50% now and you can
see that our draw is now 24 amps so if
anyone in chat feels like doing some
quick math that number just let's call
it twenty four point five times twelve
point three is how many watts we're at
for the PCIe II cables
I think that's gonna put you somewhere
near 300 Watts and then previously we're
at sixteen - sixteen point five whatever
that may be and that's going to be our
amperage going through the PCIe cables
and do you want to let's how well does
that current clamp show up okay so
there's our current clamp see if we can
not auto focus on the cable and kind of
dark I know it's not in the white but
the clamp is here it's clamped around
the 12 volt lines for PCIe on the video
card which is a Vega 56 and the fans
starting to spin up so I'm hearing noise
that's what it's from let's see I'm
gonna address some quick some questions
quickly so haha Ryan says curious to
hear snowflakes senior AMD analyst
opinion on Vega performance can we
expect the video or article soon you
know
snowflake has been a little too
demanding lately on the compensation for
those articles so we'll see she's
currently tasked with shipping and
receiving temple others I have three
hundred euros for a GP you sold my ten
sixty this from John I use my IG P now
since it's almost exams time should I be
saving up money's got big a fifty
six we're gonna use 1070 I don't know
it's this is what I was saying in the
review it's really hard to say exactly
what to do right now because the prices
are all over the place Vega 56 isn't
technically out it'll be out on the 28th
I think and at that point we'll be able
to tell if the prices stick or not but I
just say keep an eye on that okay so
back to this thing as you can see we are
over powered on this we've gone over the
power limit 50% and now we need to I'm
gonna manually set the fan speed
actually no this is a good opportunity
to demonstrate some other bugs with this
so let's type in 2700 rpm I think this
will trigger a bug yeah see this so this
reports 3000 10 RPM right now and
basically there's an offset here where
the number you type in add at least a
couple hundred rpm it gets exaggerated
as you go up the chain so we're at 3300
now versus 2900 input to keep that in
mind that the good news is that and the
fixed bug here where once you increase
the speed you couldn't decrease it that
was on Vega Frontier edition but it's
been resolved for 56 so that's good and
let's just bring this we don't need this
that high yet we don't need instructions
okay so here's what we're gonna do now
let's do a demonstration of setting the
voltages and the frequencies and I'm
gonna switch to watt tool soon because
this will be insufficient at some point
by the way our clock rate is now
reporting higher but anyway so let's do
a let's see if this will cooperate and
let me bring the voltage down to 1100
millivolts that is so 1.1 1.1 volts okay
so this is the only real way to know if
this works right now just because the
tool is so buggy traditionally if it
doesn't work it'll just crash so you
know very well that doesn't work but if
it's staying stable it doesn't mean it
applied right now so the only way to
test it you can probe the back of the
card with a DMM which we're not gonna do
right now or you can check the clamp
reading and it's kind of bouncing up and
down so it looks like it's applied you
can see we're at 20 2.6 right now we're
at
nearly 25 earlier and it will go back up
occasionally because when we didn't
really under that much but you can see
clearly that we're drawing less power at
the PCIe rails and the PCIe slot for
anyone curious is really only
responsible for powering the fan so
that's gonna be no more than 28 watts so
1,100 millivolts
now the thing is we can actually get
this clock higher as well there's a bug
here too which I'm going to show right
now we can type in this might be stable
hole find out I'm kind of going from
memory here if we type in 1600 okay so
it's it's increased the clock we're at
1530 1540 now in the reported clock
which not sure how accurate that is but
we typed in 1600 now if I type in 1620
note that it does change it it adds to
every time which is just a rounding
thing it will increase now we're at 1550
so we were at 1530 a moment ago so it
has offset by 20 megahertz which is what
I asked it to do but we're inputting a
much higher number than we're getting
and that's partly because of Andy's new
dynamic frequency switching stuff and
partly I think because this stuff is all
software's all very buggy right now but
it's similar to what we're seeing with
the fan outputs being that what we asked
for anyway we've increased the clock
rate clearly and we're actually still
drawing like 1 to 2 amps maybe maybe 1
to 0 amps last but regardless we've
really not changed the power consumption
much from the 50 percent offset we've
lowered it a little bit we can do better
than that though and at this point I
think I'm gonna switch to watt tool so
I'm gonna get rid of watt man and we're
putting keeping the card under load with
fire strike still so let's grab watt
tool and I need to launch this as
administrator because we've got fire
strike or a afterburner open so this is
what tool this one works ok it's not
officially updated but it does work and
I'm gonna check chat and things like
that for a moment gbesi work reports
megahertz right I yes it does report
megahertz it reports the frequency but I
need to look into it to see how accurate
it is and then disturbed medic $10
just a little something as a thanks for
all the late nights yes well thank you
for watching because waking up and
seeing actual views on the video
certainly it certainly helps it's like
oh people actually listened to the stuff
we had to say after working for two days
on revenge in the 1070 and then getting
the whatever this card is called up to
speed the 56 keep wanting to call the
560 alright so frequency we've got our
frequency table here DPM States up to
seven the ones we want to play with are
six and seven only you don't really want
to mess with five or below because it
will cause a bug in the software that I
don't know if it does it with 56 but
with VIP it would set this or this one
rather memory frequency down to 500
which this says 500 it's actually not
correct it's 800 right now that is one
of the few things afterburner reports
correctly is the HBM to speed so let's
set this number to 1080 and let's see if
we can keep the frequency there for now
theoretically this will apply well we'll
find out if the bugginess rears its head
so right now I'm still seeing 23 to 24
amps which is higher than it should be
so we're gonna try I might have to start
resetting some of the stuff and
reapplying it but we're just gonna start
typing in lower numbers until we see
some kind of change or don't and if we
don't then we'll reset everything so
here's here's why I did not benchmark
under Bolton for all the games with that
review because when we have like 27
hours but to more importantly it's not
really fully functional it works kinda
but you can see we're really not
changing our current going through there
so right now it's not affecting anything
so what we need to do is reset
everything so I'm going to reset the
power target to offset zero reset the
clocks to native power targets in native
we can probably leave the fans alone so
that works now we're at 16 17 amps again
so that's clearly applied and there's
there's a certain order to this I can't
remember what it is right now but we're
gonna find out either you have to do
this one first or the other one for
we've offset power okay we're at 24 amps
again now let's set this to 11 100
millivolts
100 millivolts set and we're down to 20
to 23 amps okay I'm looking okay so far
not gonna play with the clock rate until
we actually see this functioning so
there we go
21 amps it's working we're down three
which is gonna be in the 30 to 40 watt
range she is a number more people are
familiar with and it's good on to 10 40s
you bet stable at 1040 eventually this
will either crash or it'll just stop
applying but I want to see how low we
got the power draw first so now we're at
20 to 21 amps remember our starting
point here is 25 so we've dropped 5 amps
which the five times twelve point three
is gonna be a little over 60 somewhere
so now we can go down to 10 20 so that
means we've dropped about 60 watts so
far as a reminder we have a power target
offset of 50 so that's actually
increased in our clock from what
afterburner is reporting remember this
is not really fully accurate but what it
is it is a accurately it is precisely
inaccurate meaning it's offset the same
amount each time so with that precision
we know we've got a 20 megahertz boost
over the stock clock and we're under
volted from the power target offset and
now we're at 19 amps so we can get there
so it is working we're getting down
towards the actual stock power draw
while persisting with a higher clock I'm
gonna go to 10:15 which is the lowest
stable I tested previously any below
that will be news to me and this is
looking like about where it's either
breaking or where we're no longer seeing
gains so let's call it eighteen to
nineteen point five amps is our current
rage range I'm gonna check the comics
and things for a moment
Sebastian kraut Howser dude your content
is fantastic and I really appreciate the
effort but get some sleep at some point
seriously don't tell me how to live my
life but yes I agree with you thank you
thank you for the help
for the super chat donation anything I
say let me know if there any major
questions about this process I should be
addressing in chat live while it's
scrolling by but ok let's look at the
next step so we are currently at we're
still at 19 amps so this is still
functional for now eighteen point five
to nineteen looking pretty good actually
we're only two apps over what we were
stock complete stock no power offset
which was 16 amps so two amps over two
to three things are somewhere in the 20
to 30 watt range more power consumption
so 30 watts more power but a well as
we'll see in a moment a higher clock so
let's go ahead and you know let's get
gpu-z open - there's because I'm not
sure which software to trust right now
with Vega it all it all needs to be kind
of updated is this reporting the same
yeah so they're all reporting the same
number and I don't know how accurate it
is I think this one's actually accurate
right now it seems to me when it's in
like complete stock configuration that
it's wrong and you'll see some reviewers
and users talking our clocks of like
2000 megahertz which is not possible
without some insane cooling or maybe
even at all so those numbers are wrong
and that's it because the software is
buggy well let's push this let's just
put them both to 1590 which I think I
had trouble with before and see if we
get any change and they're reported no
okay so now we're both 50 90 let's go up
to 1612 I'm doing the the 2 megahertz
rounding that want Manzo's I don't know
if it's necessary but we can still type
it in alright here we go see that number
or this number we were at 1475 a moment
ago which was 1590 let me just reset
that 1590 1590 that should bring us down
to 14 75 okay well apparently apparently
we're gonna clock higher than that now
thank you
souther okay we're done we're between
1515 25 so it's kind of working
but again if you do this at home just be
aware that you're gonna encounter a lot
of bugs and problems
and as we can see that has increased our
power consumption now so instead of just
going to unstable and crashing it is
remaining stable about it's increasing
the voltage going to the core without
asking us so we're actually back up
closer to where we started and this is
why it was so frustrating to work on for
that review last minute because there
there is a method to it and you can get
it to behave but I can never quite
figure out exactly what that process is
let's increase this one and see if maybe
we just need to provide enough more
voltage to get it stable at these lower
bolts or we might have to reset
everything again I think we will
probably have to reset everything again
PC cold-war are using a custom profile
performance balanced yeah so we're not
using the wot man profiles right now we
are using the technically it's a custom
one and using wot tool to do the changes
so I may switch back to wot man to see
which one's more reliable and then a $10
donation from Sean Thank You Sean much
appreciated no comment on it it appears
but thank you for that let's see is
another one oh yeah okay so I think this
users name might be skylake if I
understand correctly and they said the
Vega launch price was a launch discount
price and that prices will jump up
shortly WTF do they actually say that
has so I know this story was posted a
few hours ago so I've been able to
follow it I know that overclockers said
that but I don't know if AMD has of that
we did a mail them and asked for
confirmation but someone go ahead an
update Chad if Andy's actually
officially commented on that because I
don't I don't know if that's anything
more than a rumor right now okay so
we're gonna reset everything cuz it's
not working very well clearly so resets
I don't know if I need to click that but
it's working so we're gonna do it
clark's dropped power consumptions
dropped 16.5 apps now
and anyone who's new to the stream right
now that is this phone is attached to a
current clamp so it's given us a direct
feed from the PCIe tables so let's try
this again this time I'm going to try
changing the clock first and then the
voltage 1612 let's do that
I know wait wait and you talk to the
power set okay we're at 24 amps so that
has worked sixteen twelve okay
that's worked how can we bring this down
so we're going to 1100 millivolts we've
dropped a nap for so it appears to be
working
ten eighty
okay currents not changing right now
still not seen a change this is what I
was talking about this is what I wanted
to go and stream the show is how
unreliable this is so a moment ago this
worked but I adjusted the clock second
now we adjusted the clock first and it's
not working let's reset and this time
okay power off set and let's do this
first this time maybe the clock was just
pushing too high 1100 okay we're going
from 25 amps 23 10 80
okay now we're now it's kind of working
again so we were at 25 amps a second ago
we're at 21 to 22 now and it's starting
to work at these frequencies maybe we
need to keep the frequency a little more
conservative because again it doesn't
seem to crash when it can't support it
it just boosts the power which means
again if you're benchmarking this you
really need a direct way to get the
voltage going to the core or the current
coming off the rails so you can use a
DMM to the backlit card on the probe
points or you can do what we're doing
here and that will validate if you're
actually drop in power or if it's lying
to you in the software and then just
increasing the power as it needs it
which happens frequently so we're still
down we're at 21 which let's get a skip
one of these up two just to get kind of
the numbers easier to follow so right we
were at 25 let's get an exact number of
that so twelve point three volts that's
about three hundred to three hundred ten
watts of power going through the rails
and then if we where are we now we're at
twenty point three now it's actually a
good bit lower right this 20.3 to twenty
point eight let's call twenty twenty
five twelve point three so we've dropped
50-plus Watts so right we've dropped
about 55 watts which is really pretty
damn good I haven't touched the
frequency at all so we're at the same
frequency we were at we're at a fifty
percent power target we've increased our
clock stability and how high it's going
without actually changing it manually
because the boo States working a bit
better with more room to play not a lot
though we can change that and we've
dropped power so that we are now about
what will be out before like 16 point
something so we were at 203 now we're at
252 so we're 50 Watts over where we
started as opposed to 100-plus Watts
remember we were at 310 a second ago so
if I reset everything which I'm not
going to do because it'll all break we
were at 310 and that was 108 Watts over
where we are
but now we're 55 so we've clearly got
this functioning at the moment 10:30
it's gonna go down more so now we are
approaching 19 amps we're at 20 19.7
there we go it's working that's that's
exciting to see okay so for my own
future reference
it seems that fixing the power target
offset first and then doing this and
don't touch the frequency until last and
checking the questions and comments here
one more in the style of tech power up
can you do a percent efficiency over
performance you get from doing this
versus stock 100% and their graphs I
don't want to do the math yes I I think
I follow you so basically a performance
per watt type of thing if I understand
you correctly Sean so that's what you're
saying I think we can do that for you
next one Mikkel Corral do you have a
compressor in the audio if so please
lower the ratio and make up gain when
you don't speak the fan background noise
is being amplified way too much do we
have something like that last time if
you know where to change it I guess go
ahead otherwise sorry about that we
don't have a we're hooked up straight to
a camera so I'm not sure how much
control we have here but yeah I can
actually
I what sir we're at 70 Celsius so I
think I can get away with lowering the
fan rpm a bit let's go down to 2100 it
wants to stay at 75 okay so hopefully
that helps out we're gonna increase our
temperatures a bit as a result but the
vent is actually quite loud so it might
not just be that you're hearing it
amplified it's good mm
okay all right that should help out a
bit let me know if that help hopefully
did okay so where are we now we are at
20 amps and we're at 10 30 millivolts
with a frequency of 15 38 and 1594 DPM
six and seven I'm gonna keep leaving
those alone for now it's let's kind of
push our luck and see at what point the
voltage breaks and then we'll know for
when I reset all this and and we can
just start there next time 10 20 seems
to be working we haven't crashed and it
hasn't sprung back up to the 25 amps it
was at 10:15 it's hard to say if it's
doing it oh yeah it's going down another
12 watts one amp 12 watts so it is still
working and we're at stock frequencies
but we are offset on the power by 50% so
right now we're not gonna have a huge
performance gain in terms of frame rate
but we we will have a we're gonna drop
our power consumption down quite a bit
18 amps not bad right so we're at 16 so
we're 24 watts over where we started at
1 1005 millivolts so 1.05 volts that's a
pretty good reduction actually I'm happy
with that let's let's well you know we
might as well just see where it breaks
right so let's get onto it let's do a
thousand I'm happy with 1005 but just
just so we know where we can expect this
to fail
this will help and this also is gonna be
dragging our temperature down with it as
you reduce power consumption you reduce
the thermal concerns
18 hard to say 17 something - 18
something looks like - working at some
point this will either prove to be no
longer applying which I'm questioning
whether it is now maybe 17 points
something - yeah seventeen point three
so it looks like it's still applying or
at 975 millivolts down from 1200 let's
do a bigger step let's try 955 and just
I really just want this to break at this
point or to prove itself to not be
functioning falling down to 16 something
we are actually where our stock power
comes on
was now how our clock is actually pretty
effective though so check this out
we're at 1413 megahertz and we started
out something like 14 75 I think what's
our peak here no that's not really
reliable yeah we were definitely up
towards 1500 so you can see where it's
it's doing what it's doing this is what
Vega does now
so we're decreasing the voltage and it
does one of two things either it well
one of three things either it works or
it down clocks you and works or there's
no change whatsoever and your power
consumption goes back to where it
started in which case it didn't work and
either that's a software bug or
something else so we're clearly pushing
too little voltage now because we're
just dropping clocks like crazy to the
point where it's gonna affect your
performance negatively I'm just gonna
see what happens like does this actually
just straight break or crash at some
point or does it just keep down clocking
itself
let's do 800 mm I'm thinking it should
crash at that point no okay but it's
also not applying anymore we're not
seeing a change here our frequency is no
okay our frequency is like six megahertz
lower but that's close enough to be
insignificant all right
so noted we know where we can go down to
like the 1000 million let's call it 10
15 10 20 before we start dropping clocks
like crazy so let's let's you know let's
start at 10:30 I think I said we have to
adjust this first otherwise it'll not
apply if we adjust the frequency first
I'm checking the comments here so are
you used to Papa I recognize that name
are you considering getting an
instrument for frequency measuring for
audio testing such as fans and cases so
that would be for doing like a frequency
spectrum plot or something we've tried
to do stuff like that before the problem
is I'm not trained enough in audio to
recognize when something is accurately
reporting or when something's being just
kind of blown out of proportion by our
measuring tools so not right now we've
done for ages ago did a frequency
spectrum plot with our our zoom recorder
mic and it was it worked okay but I
wasn't happy with my level of
uncertainty and the results so we just
stopped if there is a good way to do it
in the future
then I'll look into it and then yeah so
bill joins in here and just pointed out
what we were talking about a second ago
probably caught it earlier than I did it
Steve it might act it might ought Oh
underclock as you lower the beak or
which is what we're seeing here and
there's no outright crashing going on so
it's actually it brought the V chord
down or the frequency down quite a bit
with that V core we did why doesn't a MD
do this tuning before finalizing the
products or shipping that's a great
question and I think the answer is going
to be Hartwell so the answer that they
give us is that it's basically a tuning
for the lowest common denominator to
make sure you're not you're not gonna
crash a blue screen or something that's
the it's a reasonable answer that's
basically what they tell us where you're
bending down from effectively a 64 to a
56 or maybe well that's probably how
it's happening and if you've been down
the range of stable voltages or the
range of frequencies where it's gonna
function is going to be different than
the higher bin chips so that's kind of
the answer they gave us where it's just
it's just tuning for the lowest common
denominator which if that's the case
then 1.2 volts is certainly gonna keep
all these stable at the clocks that they
advertise so no problems for AMD they're
all their customers are happy and the
people who want to tune can go in tune
separately
why isn't Andy I just got that one mod
'no 89 amps going up doesn't mean
voltage does yes but I don't have a DMM
hooked up to the probe points right now
and it's kind of far away from the
camera so this is the best I can do to
kind of gauge it loosely next question
is Meyerson keep up the good work reach
from Germany thank you okay so yeah it
would be nice to hook up a multimeter to
that but it's the cameras everything
setup is already kind of crazy so let's
see what we can do here without dropping
clocks let's keep that at the 10:30 I'm
gonna set this 59 you see if it changes
anything
see we're still not changing its
actually that's boost this a bit some
point this is gonna stop working if it
hasn't already I might actually have to
reset everything cuz I'm not seeing any
change anywhere okay still not seen any
changes any warehouse 1616 trying to
it's either gonna draw more power or
it's not gonna work yeah nothing's
changing now so clearly this is bug that
let's let's reset hopefully we don't
have to reboot you set everything here
and offset by 50 oh you know what I
should show is the kind of bugginess
here can we get this all done now right
so the thing here I want to show is
sometimes and I was talking to Paul
about this to you from Paul's hardware
we're not really sure why or when it
happens but sometimes if you input
frequencies here manually it won't
really do anything and we kind of found
that doing a frequency percent offset
worked a bit better with these Vega
cards for now while with these drivers I
don't know if it's changed with the
public drivers I haven't tested those
yet they have 18 dot something out now
okay we're at the right everything apply
so we got a we got an offset there 8% I
was crashing around 10 earlier 10.5 I
think so is it actually working is the
question okay while it worked because it
crashed so that's good we're actually
seeing something happen with percent
offset I got to reboot this thing
to power on all right
do you think it's possible to use Vegas
64 customer overclocks with 550 watt
high-end power supply ye possible yes
I haven't actually tested the power draw
in Vegas 64 yet so I can't answer that
we did frontier Edition overclocking
though if you offset power Drago by 50%
we were just seeing 300 watts through
the cables the power cables so you I
think you'd probably want a higher
wattage power supply just to be sure
that's 300 watts overclocked already out
of 550 and then you've got the whole
rest of the system's here so I would go
a bit higher than that I don't think AMD
I think recommended a thousand watt
power supply for the liquid version
that's absolutely unnecessary but this
is a product where it's gonna be higher
consuming in terms of power than others
so you need more than 550 I think if
you're overclocking for sure honey
forest did you see the link to the
contact paper that measures diet water
block pressure I did not that's actually
a really interesting idea though I like
that sir papa
are you considering reviewing fans like
you did with knocked or a one time thing
for right now it was a one-off I'd like
to do more because I bought the tools to
do it
but not today and then last one for
right now Vincent there are USB
multimeters that can overlay on OBS oh
that's really cool I did not know that
that's a cool idea
Lewis Rothman uses those okay well noted
I'll look into it for next time that's
pretty cool idea alright 3d mark
settings
and we are just gonna set this around on
the background again while going for a
percent offset just to kind of show how
that aspect of the tool where it's done
we'll get back to seeing what we can do
with undervolt in if anything at this
point so like it kind of works and it
will maintain a higher clock but I just
can't get it to hold as soon as so in
fire strike it will hold and then as
soon as I close or actually in any
application so if I do that here's
what's going on if I do the undervolt in
vibe and one application get it stable
and get it to a point where the clocks
actually higher not lower so not down
clocking like we saw earlier if I do
that it'll work for the application for
sure for a little bit anyway and then
sometimes it seems like when I switch
applications to a game it'll stop
working or I'll have to go back in and
change things again so I'm not really
sure what the deal is I think it's
probably a good idea to to just try and
grab the next driver rev when Andy
pushes it whenever that is because there
are a lot of known issues with this one
that they talked about them to you like
this is not a surprise to media they
communicate is everyone what the issues
are but anyway so we're 10% off side
just because like I said this was
working a bit easier earlier and
everything seems like it's kind of
working through watt tool or watt man
rather I'm going to bump this down to
nine because I know we just crashed a
moment ago out that one
so bump that down let's see what we can
do for voltage 1200 right now we are
holding at whatever advertised speed
that's telling us let's see so it thinks
that we are at 14 68 right now for the
frequency let's go ahead and drop this
to something conservative 1180
and we're still holding we're actually
yeah we're going we're at 1500 so 1478
to 1500 right now is very unfortunate
because it goes up and down with the
fire strike down I should probably just
freeze that actually to
frame and let's so that's table what can
I do here
not really dropping clocks yet at one
we're at a 11:50 millivolts we're not
dropping clocks here
noticeably not in a way that I'm seeing
7:25 let's kind of do this incrementally
Oh nope 11:25 oh by the way you can't go
up to 1250 on this you can do that on
vfe but here your max is 1200 just to
kind of draw everyone
so it's resetting which means it's not
going to work your max is 1200 on the
Vega 56 card and we crashed this time so
now because I'm using the percent offset
we're getting crashing which means it
seems to be applying more correctly
versus if you type it in manually either
doesn't apply or it does so in a
different fashion than you've asked for
it and this is the frustration we're
going through a last minute during the
review it does kind of hard crash - by
the way drivers everything crash it
freezes up so
let's see just checking chat and stuff
all right
so we are currently rebooting again
during the percent offset method made
the clock actually apply whereas
previously doing it through typing the
thin end was either applying it to be
lower than requested or just there just
straight not working without actually
giving user feedback
okay 3dmark this time I'm just gonna
freeze it on one frame to kind of work
with something a bit easier demo okay we
need this to be windowed alright and
I'll just shout out bill joy here he was
on the chat for a little bit I don't
know if he still is actually hardcore
overclocking so he's got a channel where
he does this stuff all the time every
day hence the name actually hardcore
overclocked he and I'd encourage you to
check it out it was a hell of a lot more
about overclocking than I do
I am certainly nowhere close to his
level not an expert I don't hurt my
things yet but I know I ought to point
out how some of the software works and
how to do the somewhat under bolting and
things like that the rest of it you just
kind of learned trial by fire strike but
uh his channel is great for all the
other stuff and I'm sure you'll be doing
Vega content as well so give the man a
subscribe if you haven't already okay
so I'm gonna freeze this on one of the
frames alright and let's see if we get a
more stable readout now without all the
fluctuations we saw earlier because it's
just gonna be rendering the same thing
over and over so custom once again
offset 50% fans ramping up I'm sorry
about that actually anyone want to see
how loud this fan gets does any volley a
volume warning if you're wearing
headsets you've been issued a warning
just relative to my own voice let me we
did a DB measure on this and I think it
was a something like 66 or 66 to 70 DB a
here we go so I don't know how that's
picking up on the mic light probably
really not pleasant though so let's just
revert that right away but there's
there's your arrange for the fan it's
really not a great cooler all right pair
offs that's good all that's good lets us
do see this one more time let's see and
then I'll go on to other overclocking
things so let's drop this again let's
just go to 1180 stock clocks make sure
it's applying 25 amps steady right now
24.8 it's very study actually so this
freeze-frame was actually it was a good
idea for sure I get this hair off my
head
so we're pretty steady and that makes it
easier to tell with the changes 1160
next time I might hook up at the drill
multimeter and plug it into OBS that was
a really good idea then we'll be able to
see the current and the voltage which
would be nice is it doing anything is
the question
is there like a percent offset on this -
no okay
24 yes where were we at a second ago at
twenty four point four all right 25 okay
so it's working twenty five point one
and it's gone to this so we're currently
twenty five point one and now we are at
23.5 are we dropping clocks that's the
question
so we've reduced our power draw a little
tiny bit right 15 33 megahertz right now
and a second ago we're at let's let's
just confirm this for sure I'm learning
with you guys right now because I didn't
have enough time to really dig into this
with the review so we were at 15 34 I
just increased the voltage that give it
a second to figure out what it's doing
and once we get an update on the numbers
one though so we're at 14 82
I'm gonna give it another couple seconds
here but it looks like that's where we
are 1482 what was I at 11 20 millivolts
so let's go down to 11 20 millivolts
again and we're at 1530 okay now we're
seeing the result we're actually seeing
the frequency improve with the voltage
reduction let me just do this like one
more time to make sure we're not
catching it during some spiky behavior
15:33 right 1200 or well we're currently
at 1120 I've typed in 1200 I haven't hit
apply we're at a 0% off site we're at
50% power offset and at the 11 20
millivolt input I have we're at twenty
two point six amps let's apply that so
we're back up to stock voltage now we've
dropped this time the third times I
think we can call it 1484 megahertz and
we're up to 25 amps so this is actually
working this time it's exciting to see
so we're not a 12 to 20 Watts higher
which is not huge but it's enough to
tell us that stuff is functioning and
we're not dropping clocks now that I'm
watching it more carefully 11 10 apply
we go up to 15 20 so it's not quite as
good as the 15 30 number we saw more ago
we were at 15 33 and I want to go right
15 28 now I haven't offset the frequency
yet
so we're still just working within the
confines of of everything else but we're
still 30 to 40 megahertz over what it
was at one point two volts and we're
down now by 24 watts of power
consumption at the PCIe cables and we're
down to one point one one volts so we've
reduced our frequency a little bit but
we from from the already under voltage
frequency mind you 15:24 we've lost
where megahertz here assuming this is
all accurate this time and we're down to
22 amps let's see how low we can go
before we start getting that 1480 number
1080 and then I'll start trying to do a
frequency offset 1080 ok 1519 so we've
dropped we're dropping like at this
point 18 megahertz from where we were a
moment ago 15:33 our power is actually
falling we're at 21 amps now I'm 25 so
we've cut off a good amount like 50
watts or something and let's let's see
what we can do here thought it crashed
for a second
let's do have 4% just see what a modest
4% does does it crash and while that
figures out of its table I'm gonna catch
up on chat so where were we last time
Greeks from Germany we're at builds or
question earlier or a statement rather
not quo he certainly just he certainly
doesn't have a question for me so
catching up possible now I got that one
honey forest did you Scout that one I
got that one Steve are you going to do
the hybrid model this yes working on it
you have to set all P States below the
max P state to the lower voltage or the
max P States the card will clock to is
the one with the highest voltage now so
actually with this I'm assuming that was
referring to watch earlier these
actually just in custom mode all we have
is DPMS 5 and 6 or sorry 6 &amp;amp; 7 in custom
mode that's all it gives you and I think
this ties back to Vega frontier edition
where if you
these because you actually could change
these then we can't now frontier Edition
drivers if you change these it would
drop your HBM frequency to 500 megahertz
would have it and with what tool it will
show you those those other values so
what tool will show us here you go see
the wall tool shows us one through four
five as well but it does just don't
don't mess with it wot man there's a
reason it only shows us the last two and
that's why I'm only adjusting the last
two because it's buggy next question is
a Shawn can you explain the difference
between Andy's new power management on
Vega versus previous cards or are they
the same new power management on Vega
versus previous not right now I need to
read the white paper honestly I'm just
you know we got the card I tested it so
my knowledge right now is technician
technician level knowledge of testing
the thin and experiencing how it works
and things like that I don't actually
know all the details on that
unfortunately next question bonus what
do you think the highest stable clock
you get on thread Ripper 1950 X he's in
a custom loop is no idea I think we
overclocked to four gigahertz and I've
seen people do 4.1 I think I saw one
person do 4.2 the ln2 folks we
interviewed did 5.2 I know there was a
record set at five point three or four
something like that so I'm really not
that's not a I don't I haven't followed
thread reference Baker can that is there
a chance IV partners can improve on
power draw efficiency by using better
parts and how much other restriction to
voltage and power draw would they be
able to eliminate on their card so this
is what we've been talking with them a
lot yeah there will be improvement what
the biggest thing I'm asking the board
partners is with BIOS the question is
will you guys also lock BIOS as part of
the alleged Microsoft secure platform
initiative that Andy is taking which
they decided we're gonna lock BIOS and
make it so that you can flash it but you
can't modify it you can't rename the
BIOS you can't change the power
offset so working with build Zoid I
tried to offset the card 100% power and
we even just tried changing the name of
the bios and we can flash it on there
with ati flash but it will not
initialize the display and put anything
out so you flash back to where it was
and it works fine so this is part of
what Andy is saying is a compliance with
Microsoft secure boot protocol I suppose
how valid that is of an explanation I'm
not sure right now I need to look into
it but that's what they say so we took
that and we reached out to the board
partner just getting back to your
question and asks will you guys also be
forcing these requirements where people
can't flash BIOS because if they have
them first off there's a dual BIOS chip
why can't I flash it why is it on there
if I can't do anything with it anyway
all that's doing is giving me a switch
to save myself from when it doesn't work
because of their own secure boot
requirements so I'm not really sure but
if you have to a BIOS I feel like there
should be leverage or room in there
working with Microsoft if that is
actually the problem to make one of them
in overclockers BIOS where you can tune
stuff and to build Zoids point that he
made earlier today when I was talking
with him motherboards conform to this
secure boot protocol and have for a
while but you can still adjust ram
timings and those and other things so
why is it a limitation here I think
there's room to play and I hope a IV
partners actually take note that people
want the ability to flash bios because
this vrm and the GPU can handle more
than what we're giving it right now and
what we're able to so I hope to see that
I also hope to see well I don't I don't
know that we'll see voltage tuning we
will see pre overclocks
for sure some of the liquid gold cards
from board partners as opposed to around
17 well okay this is month old
information but 70 hundred megahertz was
what I was hearing then for Vega 64 for
liquid cooled cards I'm not sure if it
actually came out to be that and Zeta is
typing in one more question to me so I'm
gonna check that before moving on to
this by the way this is still stable
we're at 15 63 megahertz which is really
pretty damn good
as a reminder we were at 15 33 when we
okay let's let's walk through it so we
were at from memory
at one point I please consider 1,200 we
were at 14 84 or something like that
somewhere in 1162 11 80 range we were at
15 38 or 3 and then now where are we we
are currently running on 1080 so we're
currently on 10 80 millivolts and it's
actually working this time which is nice
and we're at 15 63 with a 4% frequency
offset let me just save this okay so
we've got a guide here now if this
crashes and I have to redo it
all right next couple before I move on
wishbone five dollars thank you Andy
jumped up the prices to $600 your
thoughts and why would they shoot
themselves in the foot so to speak so
according to Zeta helped out by googling
this a little bit and says he hasn't
found an update on this so basically
this question comes down to there was
the note there's two things right
there's a prize which is clearly more
expensive and then there was the
statement by overclockers UK I think and
I haven't heard an official statement
from Andy talking about prices yet so I
don't know if they did that or the
retail partners are doing that Andy as
they told us their direct quote in the
at the press event to a roomful of media
was we can't put a gun into the
retailer's heads and you know implied
Delon what price to set so I don't know
if if the prices are really up $100
that's a huge deal to be fair and videos
prices are also up right now so it
ultimately comes down to where they fall
once the stock stabilizes a bit I will
give you my thoughts on the pact though
we shot a video on this didn't air it we
might revisit it or something but the
pacts turned out a lot differently than
I was expecting the way I thought it
would work is you go to new egg you add
the card to your cart and it says hey we
gave you these discount coupons you can
use them if you want to otherwise just
buy the card and it's an extra $100 or
whatever it may be
unfortunately the way it actually worked
out was they bundled the cards in with
the other hardware simultaneous
so there's like 12 different listings on
new AG or something you can add any one
of those 12 it comes with the
pre-selected motherboard CPU and monitor
in the US another issue with these and
the discounts theoretically pre-applied
you have no control over what's added to
them beyond what they give you and it's
sometimes they're extremely weird
configurations like the really kind of
the msi xb-70 titanium board that builds
read analyze on our channel which has an
unimpressive vrm especially for the
price bundled with RX Vega and 1700 ax
and 1800 X parts only it's kind of I do
not like the packs I'll go on record
with that now I think they could have
been done better it is clearly an
attempt at trying to make sure Andy's
not losing money on the Vega cards
because that HBM to cost a lot of money
it's it is not insignificant we're
trying to get an official statement on
the price but I have some ideas the vrm
is actually really nice on Vega 56
they're using the same PCB on vrm that
they are on vfe everything's pretty
expensive it's a huge die so I think the
packs are basically saying how do we
recoup money from other areas of our
ecosystem the CPU in the motherboard to
account for what might be a loss leader
negative 56 I'm not sure about Vega 64
those are my thoughts on it right now
but let's let's go back to this
so we're stable at 1563 megahertz we're
doing pretty well actually we're at 1080
millivolts we're at twenty one point six
amps so we're down we were again we were
at a 25 when we started so we're doing
well overall looks pretty good let's see
where we crash let's go up to 5% again
just a refresh where this seems to be
working better right now then manually
entering the frequencies as Paul also
noted this to me when we were talking
during the review period right 1573
megahertz so 10 80 millivolts what'd I
say we're at 15 setback songs in 1573
now let's do this way four percent and
what do we did I play it and I were at
five percent
apply
we are currently at 1588 6% we're just
waiting for it to crash if you don't
want to do more testing than this
obviously but it's gonna give us a
ballpark idea 1080 1600 megahertz now
looking pretty good
what's our power we're at this this
scale is like insane so probably ignore
this the scale the scale is 21.5 that
twenty two point one we're at 22
so not really much change on the power
consumption so we're actually still
ahead for power consumption and we're
still ahead four o'clock what was this
seven percent now now we're cooking now
we're off to the races
apply eight percent 1080 1609 it's gonna
crash at some point it might crash
sooner in in games then we may have just
crashed actually crash sooner in games
than in fire strikes sometimes depending
on the game The Witcher 3 seems pretty
bad about it so we crashed at an 8
percent offset we're doing four amps
lower than we were with just the power
target offset which is great we have a
clock that is up from a reported what
was the reported number 14 84
so our reported number was 14 84 on the
clock when we did just the 50% off set
at 1200 millivolts and now we're down to
10 80 millivolts and we were able to
offset the clock to 16 something
16:09 kind of crashed at that point so
we're gonna have to pull it down a
little bit but we're able to do all this
with a lower power throughput and do
just fine on clocks there's really
nothing to be upset about with those at
this point so this is an area where if
you get the card you'll have room to
play with it and he's not going to do it
for you because they want to hit the
lowest common denominator and make sure
that everything works or some other
reason that they didn't tell us but
that's kind of the assumes reason
if I'm on it
okay Vega notes all right so let's do
this one more time and I'm gonna start
messing with HBM next hbm's had a much
bigger impact for us than clocks the
frequency of the core I should say and
to the point where from memory and the
review I talked about this doing HBM and
doing a power offset power offset alone
50% offset from stock gave us about 12%
boosted performance power offset with
HBM I think gave us another 4% something
like that
it's somewhere between 3.8 and 6% I
can't remember I'll thought my head but
it's in the review this isn't winded and
so the two together is really where you
should be once we did frequency tuning
it was getting us no extra performance
it just wasn't even worth it I think
we're doing a 9% offset and we were
getting the clocks higher but it just
wasn't really doing anything for us okay
so we want this to be windowed and
looping
I guess looping doesn't matter cause
we're gonna be in demo mode and frozen
okay Gert arctor said when you have such
a small amount of time to review a
product how do you choose what to
prioritize what to test when you guys
are in such a rush do you set limits on
thousand times definitely that's a good
question so the the way I do it is more
or less you look at the amount of time
you have we kind of know how much time
it takes to do certain types of tests
because we've done them so many times so
this actually happened with Vega 56
where I'm sitting there thinking five
hours before embargo lift while also
having to edit the video because andrew
was out you thinking like can I fit in
under volt in while doing this and I
tried but I started encountering the
problems we're having here today where
it just doesn't quite apply or I don't
quite understand what's going on because
the product so new and I'm learning here
today so there's like this is great I
wish I have this much time behind the
scenes to review it but yeah so you look
at those things you're like okay I know
it's going to take me
two to three hours to benchmark the
games again so do I have enough time to
undervolt it and do that
not really so I don't have time to
overclock it and run one or two tests
okay maybe I can get one in there and
then otherwise you're looking at what
things do you like the most so for me I
really like doing thermal tests I know
that we do them pretty well we do vrm
temperature testing and stuff like that
which you don't really see elsewhere and
we had power tests in there which I
found really important and fun to do and
those things you kind of look at them
and you think well I think other people
will handle the game benchmarking really
well I don't know that I can certainly
contribute to the pool of data but I
don't know that I am going to be the
biggest point of data for gaming
benchmarks so what can I contribute
that's unique and that might give us
some insight ok we can do power stuff we
can do some thermal stuff that's kind of
how I decide and then you just run the
test until you run out of time cuz
generally my belief right now is if
you're not using all the time you have
up until embargo you're really not using
your time correctly there's of course a
lot more to that and every outfits gonna
be different
but with ours that's how I view it and
there's nothing wrong with doing it
differently but that's how I do it
alright so that's just a one more time
here go through I think we crashed at
seven or eight percent so let's bring
this down to six oh wait I need to do
the power off set the watt man actually
is is kind of behaving right now so
that's good that's really unexpected at
this point let's try a twenty two
hundred with see if it get away with it
without blowing out the audio okay
gpu-z
which is kind of working frequencies
offset already for at 1200 millivolts
right now let's go to 1099'd apply okay
we've already increased our clock quite
a bit so we just went out from fifteen
twenty five to fifteen ninety six and I
brought the voltage up so we're not
really saving a lot of power right now
we're only saving about 24 watts off
with just the power offset so ten nine
the fifteen ninety five six percent okay
let's leave that there
let's stop messing with that what can we
do here ten eighty yeah I should start a
new column here that's gonna be amps I
don't have a multimeter hooked up to
this right now
we're at 25 earlier okay let's go down
on that we are at 1587 we've lost some
of the frequency not a lot though this
is 1080 1587 6% 21 8 ish plus or minus
point one on this okay and 70 how low
can we go before it becomes no longer
worth it from Clark dropping or crashing
1583 lost on their four megahertz six
percent offset still 21.5 just clear
progression that's what makes the spot
is like actually seeing a change work
seems to be working better than earlier
than what was anyway it really just
depends on what order you're doing
things and how lucky you are with the
tools that's a lot of that time 1560
1575 six percent 20.8 amps and then what
else can we do that say let's see like
let's set a floor of where where did we
start fourteen eighty four and then with
where did we start here without the okay
we start our offset with fifteen twenty
five so at twelve hundred
we're at 1525 with a 6% offset and now
we're still ahead we're ahead 50
megahertz which is actually pretty damn
good and we're down quite a few watts so
let's set a floor of 1550 before we stop
and call it no longer worth it because
that'll still be a 25 megahertz offset
for good power savings so 10:40 1559
okay that's about 15 6 yeah 15:59 6%
19.9 and maybe another 10 millivolts in
there 1030 so where are we now
1550 that's what our goal is 1550 and we
were at 19 that 3 or 2
19.2 not bad so we are up 25 megahertz
and we're down on power consumption what
happens if I do this is he going to try
and go back up or are we just gonna
crash haven't crashed yet we're gonna
need to start an actual benchmark
runnings and really force it to crash
but this might do it at some point so
eight percent offset we're back up 1571
what's her power 19.3 we haven't
increased power really okay well let's
leave it there for a minute I don't let
this run see if it crashes or not yep so
there's there's our crashing fine once
we got it running all right I think any
more questions I'm gonna probably start
working on I'll show off HP I'm to stuff
next I think we kind of gave the idea of
a undervolt at this point it takes a lot
of guessing and checking right now and
you just have to make a get to a
decision point where you basically need
to decide how much more am I willing to
sacrifice frequency to save on power and
the numbers we were at a second ago
seemed pretty good for a starting point
I think you could do better but
certainly with a partner card but I'm
not gonna sit here and do that all day
so we'll do HBM to next because I'm sure
this is under building stuffs probably
getting a little boring at this point
you can kind of predict where it's going
we're starting to bottom out so let's uh
show the HBM t stuff okay questions are
can you make lighter color shirts new
design please this is a new design or
you can light your color of the new
design this is the anniversary edition
shirt I probably I probably should have
looked into the mic sorry so anniversary
edition shirt is the newest design we
have them in teal and in grey color on
the tri-blend and black cotton shirts
next one splendor solace what kind of
music do you listen to
I find your hair attractive okay mostly
the Parkway Drive and Trivium and things
like that right now
wishbone five dollars thank you very
much are you gonna be testing a C's
1440p 144 Hertz display with freesync
two
I'm not sure you for adaptive sink
testing I really want to start figuring
out some objective measurement of what
it's doing and I think we'll get there
but I'm not sure I'm not sure what the
timeline looks like so not planning on
it right now
okay all right so that's where we ended
up for now with this procedure so where
does that put us let's just kind of wrap
this end of the story line up so at
nineteen point two and we could do a
little better but let's just call it
there for now we're at 236 watts at the
PCIe cables we're at plus what's our
difference 1550 versus 1484 with the
power off said only that's probably I
should probably do it with a complete
stock to you honestly but we'll stop
there for now so what are we doing here
1550 1484 so we're up 66 megahertz and
we are down how much this is just stock
clocks with the offset right here 25 amp
so we're at 50 percent offset so we were
down from top to bottom it's 300 7-2
36.1 671 so we're down 71 watts from the
power offset mode and we are up what I
say it was sixteen - sixteen point five
for a complete stock so 202 it's call it
203 so that's really not bad I mean I'll
take that what does hit 236 I'm going to
give that much precision 236 - so we're
at 33 watt which is what we showed in
the review but I think it's a test in
games so we're 30 3 Watts that's at
least consistent without we saw in the
review 33 Watts over complete stock and
we've boosted the clock to 1550
megahertz and it's stable and it's
consistent and it's not fluctuating that
much so I'm really pretty happy with
that result and even better that you
could do better if you
you could do better x equals x if even
better that you could boost this if you
wanted to spend more time on it you had
a a IB partner card something like that
so let's stop there that looks good
last thing to do on stream just to kind
of show everyone is the HBM to you stuff
so if anyone by the way if anyone's
gonna like report or talk about our
results somewhere reddit or forums or
whatever these are the numbers you're
gonna want to give them for right now
until we have time to do more and please
make a note if there's more that needs
to be done but the numbers to give
people if you're referencing this on
stream testing are gonna be 236 watts at
the cables and we were at a 1030
millivolt entry manually into watt man
we were at 1550 megahertz
after a 6 percent offset and a Walkman
and that needs to be stability tested so
please know that and we're at nineteen
point two amps so that gives us our
power so really not bad you just
stability ties but we'll do that off
stream since it's gonna take a while a
lot of guessing and checking ok last
thing I said we do HBM so let's we're
getting away so far with this fan speed
so let's keep doing that I just blasted
that fall if we were an on stream but
it's cheap easy
you know if anyone watches this later he
just post that in the comments or
something okay
what do we want to do now we're gonna
leave this alone okay so let me just
demo this live I'll answer questions
while we're on fire strike so let's
everything reset all the stuff just
everything reset and fire strike so
we're just going to do the same thing I
did behind the scenes except more it in
a more demonstrative way no demo we're
just gonna run fire strike 1080p and let
it actually you know what we don't need
everything we only need a really the
graphics test so we can save some time
on that so we're just gonna run this
stock see what the score is graphic
score increase the power see what the
score is and this is all stuff I did
more officially in the review but it
doesn't hurt to just show everyone live
how it works out and I'm gonna do this
window just so we can keep an eye on
things so there we go that's gonna run
stock and while that's getting started
see if there any questions can you do
crossfire
so someone else asked earlier have we
tested a dual card crossfire no we
haven't I only have one for this launch
yes and someone else has to need a quad
no definitely not right now if we get
that many sure primitive discard
accelerator and draw stream bending
rasterizer are disabled now shaders have
issues with anti-aliasing how much
performance is sitting on the table from
unabled vague or harbour features has
that been confirmed this time I know so
I know it was for frontier edition
someone confirmed with us okay there's a
communication problem here somewhere one
person told us an architect that DSP R
was in fact disabled for frontier
edition and another architect else it
would be enabled for our active Vega
more recently I had a conversation with
someone also at AMD who thought that DSP
R was enabled in frontier Edition but
not fully functional so maybe not a huge
difference there and improved in rx
so that's where that's where my latest
official knowledge from them stance is
that it's on but maybe there's more room
what I'm seeing in this comment and a
couple other places online is that it's
disabled so I'm curious where how people
are testing to determine that I know so
AMD was telling me that the tool that
David Cantor used in his presentation
showing the title based rasterization
apparently that's not really functioning
correctly with Vega so I was told not to
trust that tool because it missed
reports if that's the case and that tool
is what's being used to determine if the
SPR is on or off then maybe it's
incorrect
so I unfortunately I don't know what the
current status is because I've been told
a few different things by a few
different officials so that's that's my
knowledge right now yeah that's that's
about where I am right now if if it's
all enabled then I guess we're kind of
seeing Vega as performance - whatever
driver improvements come okay so very
quickly here I'm not gonna bother
opening a spreadsheet or anything we're
just gonna kind of type in scores so
stock this is all like firestrike
testing stock we're at eighteen eight
nine - and that there is some
fluctuation there so let's do this again
this time with an offset we're only
going to increase the power target
nothing else we're not changing the
frequencies let me just double check now
changing the frequencies not changing
the HBM not changing the fan even though
that won't matter let's apply that and
let it run fire strike okay everything
looks good
what was our frequency there we were
hidden
okay reported frequencies in the 1300 I
don't know if that's accurate or not
I've been told it's it's maybe not but
that's what we're seeing at least any
more questions here while this one runs
bundle price is $600 the bundle price
per chance technically yes I don't know
if that's where it's gonna finalize
though but technically yes for 464
worked on 56 right now here's axis when
you're flying builds I'd to the US you
guys can have a Super Saiyan hair at all
you know I don't know that that I want
to get into a hair overclocking battle
with build Zoid I think he may overclock
his hair a little bit more efficiently
if you've seen his photos but less
efficiently I guess he's not really big
on efficiency is he big on more power
how come a card like Vega can have a
higher tariffs operating than 1080 but
perform the same or worse in games
there's a common question teraflops not
really a great measure of anything
gaming wise it doesn't really linearly
give you anything to work with I kind of
you can kind of extrapolate performance
especially within architectures but it's
just it's just not a good measurement of
performance in gaming think of those
really well in compute though you can
use teraflops kind of figure that out
see I don't think Andy expects to get
more much more from any driver
optimization yeah I'm not really sure
either
can we see some overclocking and hashing
I don't have any of that set up right
now and I don't really know how to set
up the e3m stuff so when I go with no on
that but I think some other I think
Anthony from tweak down did a test on it
and he's kind of the authority on the
media side with mining right now I mean
he's got half of his house dedicated to
mining so check his stuff out from what
I've been told there's more room in
there but it depends on if you're using
private miners or not I'm not really
sure what that means but it's something
like 30 mega hashes right now I guess
think would being the best channel on
YouTube thank you are you saying that
vevo music is not the best channel or
PewDiePie what else do we have not seen
any more right now okay so we got a
score so stock stock plus 50 27 69 let's
just do it quick
what's our improvement there twenty
eight seven six nine minus 18 eight
eight nine - eight - nine - so we've got
like a nine point nine percent
improvement okay
that's our baseline and you'd want to
run these multiple times really be sure
but yeah stream testing so next one
let's do an HB I'm only offset so I know
this is stable at 980 I feel more
comfortable at 950 so let's do 950 and
you don't really from what builds oh it
was Tommy you don't need to play with
this voltage I think this is the voltage
controller voltage or something but it
didn't seem to matter too much
everything else is the same we've offset
HBM by 150 megahertz and we're gonna run
this one more time yes 150 megahertz
okay alright so we're gonna see what
that is now and then I'll do a clock
offset and theoretically if it's the
same as the review you'll see that it
doesn't really impact much and that
you're better off just doing HBM - if
Andy is dead set on sticking with that
secure boot protocol by Microsoft they
won't unlock bios of modding you will
see we're kind of talking to them about
that they've expressed depends who you
talk to you there's been interest
expressed and maybe working on that but
depends on how high up the chain it goes
if it's if it's a media phasing people
it that doesn't really necessarily mean
a lot they might want it but that
doesn't mean that the higher-ups care or
that even the agreements with Microsoft
would stand or whatever
can you fix the brightness and color see
his face is red the answer I'm getting
from Andrew is if we'd normally process
it through premiere okay that's running
so the over Clarke's running or the
benchmark with HB I'm only have even
builds I'd met no I was hoping that get
to meet them at at Computex but it
didn't happen this year maybe next year
six someone saying okay I don't know if
that's okay that's maybe not relevant
here your audio is off it shouldn't be
it's where the audio is going in with
the video through the same feed so I
don't it shouldn't be that's disabled in
secure boot in your BIOS matter if this
I don't think so I haven't explicitly
tried that but as I understand it that's
not what's what's preventing us
yes so this is a good point about secure
boot with a registry treat tweak you can
disable it so we did some registry stuff
not to secure boot but to the what do we
do
power table stuff and it works with Vega
frontier Edition builds I was doing
something like 400 watts on his card so
I was working but it doesn't work on 56
yet we're waiting for helm to look into
that and see if it can be applied to 56
as well because you can get around the
secure stuff with a registry tweak and
it is pretty easy to apply just a matter
of does it work I guess we're not really
at stock and where are we HBM plus 950
let's cause stock for the clogs okay so
now we are at 21 to 6 6 0
what's our improvement here not a big
one
6 6 0 the cycle it seems a little bit
off actually and wait a minute why is
that looking like that ok well whatever
some 6 9 you know it maybe this is okay
27 6 9
is that right yeah that's about right
actually that's alright 4.3 percent okay
so now let's do one more at least let's
just go ahead and do an offset that I
know is gonna work which is 9 percent
apply and a launch and then we're gonna
see how much that matters with the HBM
overclock we do a bit more at 9 80
megahertz on hpm but I know 950 stable
so that's what we're at
pot even says 10 Saudi versus Vega rx 56
for gaming and 3d rendering Maya Adobe
Premiere there are so a friend of mine
runs the site tek.gadg tek.gadg calm
right now I think he basically just only
those articles and his review of big I
think it has 64 and 56 his reviews got a
ton of work station stuff he actually
found 64 to be a pretty damn good
workstation card interestingly I would
encourage you to check out his content
to answer your question of Maya 3d
rendering and Adobe Premiere because he
tested all that stuff and I did not so I
think he has your answer for sure tech
we love what microphone do you use like
what do you like to use for this and
other recordings Hart you and your
channel family by the way thank you so
we're using a sennheiser set up wireless
lab setup we have a reporter Mike I've
talked about this in the past we have a
reporter Mike for shows you stick Mike
and then we don't really use a shotgun
anymore it's pretty much just labs for
everything at this point it's it's an
expensive setup though it's definitely
not cheap to do Wireless labs but they
haven't failed us we got interference
every now and then that shows but
nothing too bad
ten dollars thank you
it looks sir he says hope you're having
a great day I hope you're having a great
day my day is is much better now that
we've got the under bolting more
understood I mean like I said this is
not me saying I'm an expert in this let
me teach you this is me saying let me
learn trial-by-fire on a live stream
with buggy drivers that's what the point
of this wise so yes is going quite well
now that we better understand under both
in we know kind of where the bounds are
I've given some numbers on it for anyone
who wants to post those elsewhere I
don't think I might recap it somewhere
but yeah it's it's going pretty well so
thank you okay what's our score so we
are HBM nine fifty plus nine percent on
the clock twenty two two through eight
and that is what oops Ramananda it's 2.6
so that's about what we've seen
previously let me just read you I'm not
kind of half bacon hey let me type that
in just make sure to - 21 six six zero
one six zero okay yeah
so this number we are 2.6 percent ahead
of HBM only with the core overclock with
nine percent it gets unstable after this
in my testing so you cannot really
exciting this is much better to do
actually this is the best to do yeah
earlier in the review I think we're
saying twelve percent so it just depends
on how many times you run fire strike
because it does have some variance and
then here so we are 4.3 percent over the
50 percent to only offset and what do we
do if we are let's take these final two
numbers so twenty one six six zero is
the score for HBM offset 950 - 950
megahertz so we take that from stock
rather than from the power offset what
is our gain we're at about fifteen
percent and I again I think we're seeing
nineteen for the review so something
something's a little different here but
either way I've got this set up the
system is set up a little bit
differently so that may be part of it
either way just kind of notes to myself
here HBM
950 versus stock or getting fourteen
point seven percent boost and then if we
do core + HB m versus stock
we're at 17% Pierce Spock
okay so 17.6 sure gain so that's where
we're where we stand right now you can
do a bit more because I did it for the
review but that's kind of roughly where
we are
so basically yeah you get a lot just
from this it's kind of where it falls
and we can do more
maybe one mores worth it let's do one
more I know we're gonna crash at nine
point five not at 10 percent debuffs
we're not gonna bother there and let's
just maybe this is what I did
differently in the review I have this
set the 4900 rpm so there was no right
not know actually this allow it was
three 3,000 rpm which that money kept
temperatures down to me that's part of
it last one guys last one that we're
gonna wrap up the stream run customer
okay see how it goes
a really interesting stream Thanks thank
you for the $5 support much appreciate
it helps us a lot I'm sure we will be
using this after the stream ends to go
get some local fast food I was going to
name them but frankly they should be
sponsoring us at this point so well
we'll see you know who you are
we actually we walked in there once I
don't know the guys who works there made
a joke about being celebrities and so I
guess he saw maybe someone out there
knows the answer to this we've been
trying to figure this out for months
the guy who were accept the the
fast-food place we'd like to go through
he said he saw me in some kind of
roundup video bye what were they called
the Cosmo Jew WatchMojo so apparently a
channel called WatchMojo which is pretty
big channel included I don't know if it
was us or a product I was talking about
in a WatchMojo video and he said to me
how much did you guys get for that I was
like what do you mean like like money
they owe their didn't pay us anything I
even know they existed so thanks but yes
thank you for the $5 really interesting
stream thanks yep it's not here my hub
says are using the public drivers no we
are using a press driver I think it is
called beta six a it is the one that
came out just before the public driver
I'm not sure if the public driver is
different from that one or not it might
be a little different and if that's the
case and you might be able to do better
than I'm doing here today with that
version but I already knew this how this
one behaved kind of so I wanted to use
that thank you for the honesty and
testing and discovery by Nicolas Hinton
thank you for for acknowledging it and
for watching yeah we're trying to kind
of learn this live because I mean yeah
there's a really limited launch window
and we don't often get it
normally this stuff we all do we do all
of it in the week leading to launch so
there's not much point in doing it live
but if I'm going to be learning this
today anyway I might as well learn it on
stream and everyone can see all of the
mistakes like well mistakes and crashing
and driver bugs all that stuff all at
once so we can get it all our way okay
so we got a score
what is this where this is core what are
we doing this was a 90 HBM so core Plus
let's call this 980 hona know what that
means plus 950 and we're at 9% core here
what's our gain I should be typing this
down actually
so 9% for and 980 HBM is giving us two
six five nine okay
1889
2/10 - so our performance gained not bad
20 percent increase from overclocking
what was our power during all that it
looks like we're at about 25 amps
remember we're not under voltage right
now we're just overclocked I went the
opposite direction with this and moved
on from under bolting are under bolting
results if you missed them or all up
here we ended up at tenth power here it
is right here there's these the numbers
we care about baby no no those funds the
bottom right we ended up at 10 30
millivolts 236 watts of the cables so we
were 66 megahertz up and 71 watts
reduced from baseline of the 50% power
to offset only we're really pretty good
now for the overclocking section we've
got vs. stock 50% offset only we're at a
gain of 10%
the important thing here is if you want
to not put a lot of effort into this and
you buy this card this is a 56 the power
offset is gonna help you a lot because
you 10% performance you also increase
your power consumption by about a
hundred watts 210 watts so if you want
to counter the power consumption
increase with the performance gain you
can do this stuff up here which is gonna
be manually guessing and checking but
you'll get it eventually and in this
instance what happens is we go down from
310 watts to 236 watts with a good clock
and does this have enough visibility yet
so we're sitting at 1515 50 to 60 100 in
here assuming that's somewhat accurate
anyway so that's the takeaway is you
know if you don't want to do a lot of
effort do this thing 50 percent offset
and then find some numbers here that
work you know maybe not gonna be able to
copy mine but it gives you a starting
point here you start around here and you
end up with 30 Watts more power
consumption over stock with roughly a
10% performance increase that's not a
bad trade and then if you want to
increase others
if you can do it at you know at your own
leisure but this is where we are today
so I'm gonna stop there that's enough
for the stream there's a lot more we can
do with this frankly I'd like to get the
hybrid model here first so we're gonna
liquid cool this first and see see how
far we can go with a better cooling
solution I could go a bit further on
this then I think if I increase the fans
100% but it's just not stream friendly
there's 70 decibels so it's gonna be
right under where my talking level is so
yeah that's that's what we're looking at
keep an eye out for the hybrid mod we
posted the teardown part 1 today if you
haven't seen it on the channel check out
the channel youtube.com slash gamers
nexus the tear downs up you can see the
teardown but I'll save you some time if
you've seen our frontier edition
coverage it's the same PCB same vrm same
construction different screws that's
what it comes down to so we need to do
the hybrid stuff next let me read
through the last few questions here and
then I will close out trench X spike
says do you think Vega instinct as I
tell you right now there's getting into
territory where it's it's kind of out of
what I study do you think Vega instinct
and the work station cards use the same
PCBs the other Vega cards sort of as a
way to subsidize okay that's a good
question the part of the product line so
I'll answer this on the or outside I
think Vega 56 64 and Fe is the same part
because if they're doing low volume
production on frontier Edition and
they're buying the PCB already then they
can buy a lot of that PCV a lot of that
vrm and just ship all the cards on the
same thing it probably simplifies their
warehouse and storage costs it
simplifies the manufacturing cost it
make sure they meet moq for Vega
frontier Edition which they might not
have otherwise without the 64 and 56
cards I don't know about indistinct oh
I'm sorry a Lynch Steve what is the
ambience in there it's better than well
it feels better this time last time we
did this tree was like 78 Fahrenheit so
I think it was 2060 or something so it
was really it was pretty uncomfortable
and I was sweating but it's bit lower
this time we found out one of the vents
for the AC was closed so I open that up
blade McKenzie there
$0.35 thank you very much how do you
think the 980ti would compare it to the
vega 56 of both overclocked i'm not
going to say what i think cuz i think we
haven't measured i somewhat i think we
have a 980 i reference and at least one
of those charts in the review if if we
don't I'm sorry I'll try and run the
test but I think it's in their stock so
that gives you a baseline then you can
just kind of extrapolate based on how
far people normally overclock or how far
your ears over clocks okay so this is a
great tutorial for minors someone says
what wasn't the intention I I guess
you'd probably apply some of that there
okay I've never seen you sweat you know
I'll point out again we have a GN Steve
channel where I do downhill mountain
biking so there's some of that in there
I need to upload more videos but yeah I
think that's about it for the stream
everyone so thank you for watching as
always you can help us out directly at
patreon.com slash gamers and access this
shirt if you like it is the anniversary
edition shirt it actually has a PCB and
vrm components on it I would not advise
you to try and build the PCB based off
of it but it looks pretty cool so that's
on the story gamers Nexus that
squarespace.com and otherwise the last
few times I've tried to end a stream it
just a roughly interrupts me because I
click stop streaming so I think we have
to wait for all of the words to finish
going through a system or unplug HDMI
but thank you for watching you can go to
the channel for more subscribe all that
and I think I think all the important
stuff is out now I think you've probably
heard the disclaimer about the stream is
about to be cut off until someone
comments and tells me how to end a
stream so I will leave it at that
I'll see you all next time just wait for
it to end
