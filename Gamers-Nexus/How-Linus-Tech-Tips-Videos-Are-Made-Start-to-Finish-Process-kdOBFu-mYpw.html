us to see where LMG makes its videos but
we also spent time speaking with some of
the 30 members of Linus's team about how
videos are made following our factory
tour series where we show how products
are made like tempered glass or liquid
coolers this video will take the same
format for a how Linus tech tips videos
are made we spoke with Linus Etzel
Reilly Branden Nick and other members of
the team about the workflow and lifespan
of a video and even had the opportunity
to shadow some videos throughout the
process before that this video is
brought to you by us and the G on store
the best way to support our in-depth
content is to visit store gamers nexus
net and pick up one of our items we just
restocked the critically acclaimed mod
mats and medium and large and are
shipping now with the medium matte
selling through fast with their
versatile size and unique GPU gridlayout
PCB parts anatomy and GPU die spacing
diagrams t-shirts are also a great way
to support us like the teal tear down
logo design and comfortable cotton or
tri-blend visit store doc gamers XS net
and use code Linus Drop tips for 10% off
for a limited time we already have a
tour of LMG that's in a separate video
but we'll reference it several times in
this content let's walk through the
video creation process start to finish
for how an ltte video is made first a
video idea is presented at a weekly
writers meeting Linus will typically
bring his own video ideas forward for
consideration with a group of writers
pitching ideas they've come up over the
past week the video concept has worked
through as a team and then Linus will
assign the video concept to writers
writers are expected to work on multiple
ideas at once switching between them as
natural delays arise in the process like
the time spent waiting for products to
arrive we're waiting for emails to be
answered Linus assign is the topics
based upon the availability and
specialties of each person on the
writing team there are six to seven
writers on the team depending on how you
count Linus because he's still used in a
pinch although lmg seems to be
constantly hiring so this number may
increase the banana when you watch this
video after ideas are assigned the
necessary steps like purchasing
materials for the project take place
often these cause short delays and those
allow writers to work on their other
ongoing projects Linus will also
occasionally crawl through an ideas list
and delete anything that's been done
sort things that are important and bump
stuff down in favor of reviews because
LTT publishes daily and tech linked and
tech quickie published regularly it's
important for lioness to star in at
least a few videos per day
LG tries to take a standard weekend off
but with the seven-day publication
cadence the team has to fill more than
one video per day on average this
increases as travel and conventions like
copy Tech's coming up shuffle lionesses
availability and the availability of key
team members like editors or film crew
LMG tries to film enough videos to keep
a video buffer length of ideally 10
videos meaning that lmg wants to have 10
videos queued for LTT at any given time
this helps reduce the day-to-day
pressure if setbacks are encountered but
it's sometimes difficult to achieve
during our visit with the roasts and the
weekend throwing off some of the timing
the video buffer dwindled down to just
one video linus said to us that he had
the personally script at least two
videos that day to try and catch up
while the rest of his team took either a
standard weekend off or was busy with
the roasts the LG team says that a good
day is when Linus can do two scripts
reviews and two video shoots in full but
with executive level tasks sometimes
bogging down availability the team often
ends up shooting three to four videos on
Thursday and Friday instead
this causes gaps earlier in the week
because team members have multiple jobs
to do like Linus handling CEO level work
Nick light the CEO of LMG told us the
following
ideally work is done in blocks two to
five script reviews in an afternoon with
two to three videos shot the following
day based on those reviews it's very
common for Linus to be shooting primary
footage on one set while a camera person
sets up the next video on another set
for LTT specifically the goal is around
six per week not counting any long-term
projects for stuff like the $1,500 PC
showdown that we did late last year
planning and concept in meetings not
necessarily a script review but along
the same lines would be going on a
couple weeks before you shoot Plus tech
quickie which is around three per week
after all this after scenes on the
initial process and meeting with writers
we had to hand around Alan G to wait for
the next steps in the process as the
writers were busy working on their
content for
I shoot we checked in with Riley who is
responsible for running Alan G's tech
link to news channel to follow that
video creation process Riley comes in
early on the day of publishing a new
tech length video and starts checking
LTT forums for news topics and other
common websites
Riley then gathers 20 to 30 stories
before organizing them into three
headliners like major stories and five
of his quick bits the new script is
written by one p.m. at which point Riley
asks Brandon or David some of the camera
operators to set up for filming filming
is done between 1:30 p.m. and 3:00 p.m.
at which point Riley's film er passes
off the files to LMGs beloved Dennis who
then completes editing by 5:00 p.m.
the video is published as soon as it's
uploaded and processed so the entire
process for tech linked happens in one
day by the time Riley had started his
filming Linus's team was ready for us to
shadow them once again the next step in
the L&amp;amp;G video creation process is
general management and pipeline
scheduling production manager Ed's ol
Iago handles the schedule at Alan G and
runs an important role of communicating
with each team member on how far along
their videos are in the process Ed's L
helps keep or set deadlines but will
sometimes shuffle topics around if a
writer encounters roadblocks that delay
filming or scripts completion this
happened while we were there with one of
Jake's videos encountering unexpected
delays due to technical challenges with
his topic and so Riley's air pods to
review was pushed forward and scheduling
we shadowed the entire script review for
the air pods Tube video for this process
- sits with the writer to familiarize
himself with the product and the script
- looks the product over leverages past
experience to ask the writer questions
about design choices and forms initial
impressions - then reads the script line
by line with the writer changing
phrasing to ensure it matches his own
voice and tone and thins he'd say but
also checking for quality or
shortcomings if Linus feels that there's
some necessary testing missing he'll
send the writer back to complete
additional testing to ensure a complete
third product review if that takes all
necessary angles into account
- debates with writers there were strong
opinions either challenging theirs or
asking them to challenge his which we're
told - helps ensure that the content has
a more complete view by combining
multiple voices into one review if the
team doesn't agree on a particular part
of the product they'll add
those view points to the script and
present them as each person's opinion
offering more options to viewers we were
told that the script reviews can take 30
to 60 minutes with both that we were
present for taking about an hour -
occasionally writes scripts to fill gaps
when his team is maxed out but this
process is difficult unless after hours
as based on our own experience in the
studio interruptions are constant and
necessary to keep other team members
moving titling is suggested by writers
but Nick and Linus will decide on the
final title as both know the balance
between relationships viewcount and
being overly inflammatory or sensational
as the script is crawled through the
team capitalizes some phrasing to help
guide emphasis during teleprompter reads
and otherwise spaces out the content so
that it can be read quickly and
efficiently when on camera at this point
the video team is notified that it's
time to shoot LG has multiple sets to
match different video tones but they're
also useful if occupied by other
projects the team will pick between the
bedroom the living set the kitchen set
the green-screen set or the tech linked
set or something unique and then start
setting up lighting this part gets
interesting each set is prepared with up
lighting pre-configured and rigged to be
enabled with power switches and tuned
with phone applications most of the
basic lights like the rim or hair lights
the key lights the fill lights are
already mostly in place for the shoot
but the video team might relocate some
lights for special circumstances David
one of the video team members told us
that lighting setup can take anywhere
from 10 minutes to an hour depending on
how complex the shoots are for
controlling reverb and echo the studio
is lined with a black porous spray-on
foam that reduces sound waves bouncing
back to the microphone that's often have
real walls like with drywall their
legitimate walls but they don't reach
all the way to the ceiling these were
constructed in a way that makes the
rooms more versatile for use by offering
non squared corners opening up filming
opportunities considerably you can find
more discussion on this topic in our
studio tour of LNG which is also on the
channel the video team also next decides
on if an easy rig a tripod or another
solution makes the most sense for the
shot with tripods often being used for
sitting a role like in the air pods to
review David used the easy rig during
our time filming the laptop overclocking
experiment president
available on floatplane and had a red
camera monitor and audio equipment all
hooked up for fluid shots to give an
idea for cost this configuration which
you can see in our shots of David doing
his job would run about seventy-five
thousand dollars at the time of purchase
or fifty-five thousand of using the epic
W instead of the red weapon we asked how
quickly fatigue sets in with a setup
like this and were met with a quick
reply that the shifting weight makes it
physically challenging for lawn shoots
video team members are sometimes rotated
for different shoots to give recovery
periods from the amount of physical
labor involved as it's a difficult job
and by nature of being behind the camera
is one that's almost never shown to
viewers so show some love to the camera
operators next time you watch one of
their videos if the shoot is more
off-the-cuff like our laptop OC video
the camera operator isn't afraid to
interject and say to get closer shots of
parts being worked on this also makes it
easier for the editors because they can
find the necessary b-roll shots in
between the clips they need of the
aerial shots we were also occasionally
asked to ensure a better shot angle
rather than shooting one continuous clip
for all this lioness or the camera
operator will judge when to stop
recording so that meticulous or
uninteresting steps can be completed
without blowing through storage space
these shoots can consume around 65
megabytes per second at twenty to one a
30fps 8k or one sixty two megabytes per
second at eight to one in more important
projects so to film our entire
overclocking video which was over a
couple of days could easily reach
upwards and Beyond a terabyte if the
camera operator allowed filming to run
continuously without ever cutting it off
it's important for operators to know
when to cut unplanned shoots for this
exact reason storage cost is a hidden
costs to the operation that viewers
often don't see a sit-down review works
differently for these after script
review - goes off to film and the writer
accompanies Linus and the shooter to
oversee the review any inaccuracy is off
script opinions that Linus might
interject or points of important
emphasis can be caught here the writer
may realize that something was left out
when hearing it read through but is also
present in case Linus needs to double
check that the tone is a probe
for the discussion or that the
information is accurate this is just
part of the extensive QC process that's
involved for the LNG videos all this has
handled downstairs in the warehouse area
of the office LMG now occupies five
units with one dedicated for use as a
workshop with a CNC and plans to get a
press and laser cutter operational these
are often used by Alex for special
projects like custom water box for
example and are separated from the
studio by a concrete wall the studio
consists of a few units side by side
with the dividing walls removed another
unit is where additional storage and the
lounge are located currently an ongoing
project for LNG and you can see the rest
in our studio tour video after filming
the a role for the review or sometimes
before the writer will annotate each
document for the editors this will
include notes on where to find old clips
that may be relevant which b-roll shots
to use for explanations of the product
or which charts should be included for
the review and where editors and
shooters are different people although
it is sometimes easier to pull someone
versatile for special projects certain
videos like those without a script might
be best edited and shot by the same
person so the editor is aware of the
interesting and uninteresting parts but
otherwise it's typically two different
people doing that part of the pipeline
once films everything is ingested into
the server and edited down heads all
assigns an editor to the topic who can
then use the shots of the clapboard
that's used to synchronize audio and
video clips easily along with checking
notes to ensure that each shot is in the
right folder the first frame of every
video clip shows the clapboard itself
with the written notes on it as that
frame is the thumbnail in the file
browser so this allows editors to
rapidly see which video each clip is
assigned to this also helps with footage
loss mitigation as any clips with
anomalies or technological errors can be
traced back to the SD cards and the
audio equipment used for the shoot
anything defective is investigated and
resolved separately potentially
discarded to ensure no further
opportunity costs arise because some
shoots like those abroad don't get
second chances there's only one to get
it right as for storage management Ed's
ejogo noted the following quote projects
folders are kept intact we delete older
deliverables but keep the final master
copies and move them to our vault server
we're actually running low on space for
the vault so we've started backing it up
onto I think
Google from there we're actually
deleting the super old content from the
vault from our main server we send
projects to the vault after they've been
released to YouTube linus also expanded
on this telling us the following to the
greatest extent possible we have kept
every minute of footage ever recorded in
this building or other buildings we've
worked out of I'm a total data hoarder
partly because you never know when you
might need it and also because it makes
for fun opportunities to keep exploring
higher tiers of storage of technology
once videos make it through the editor
the final part of QC can begin QC
originally starts with the writers
meeting where ideas are tested for
quality and then continues into script
review then into a role where the writer
observes for QC and finalizes in editing
Taran is typically responsible for a
final editing QC pass to ensure the
video matches LG's editing best
practices like having title cards for
old clips for instance the writer for
the video also QC is the final output
and train accuracy of the script and
that the overlaid footage matches the
topic after this it goes through one
final QC pass and that's typically Nick
light or Linus Nick will stand in when
Linus is unable to watch videos which is
becoming more frequent but these two are
the ones who have the final say on if
the video represents alum z-score values
appropriately or if anything needs to
change QC is generally done in the Adobe
from your timeline with markers dropped
along the way for corrections or changes
that the editor can then make later
finally the render is queued for upload
the float plate with sponsor pickups
shot and inserted depending on the sales
team the video is then uploaded to
YouTube and scheduled the sales team is
another large Beast of the operation but
one that we won't dive into for this
video the team manages advertising or
other partnerships writers have no
visibility into the advertising or the
cost of it and often won't know the ad
for the video until it's seen on YouTube
or during the final QC passes Linus has
some insight to cost clearly he does run
the company but doesn't get involved in
ad sales this approach to editorial
separation is discussed in our LMG
studio tour if you're interested for
further thoughts as Nick white said
regarding the huge team that LMG has
accumulated quote every editor every
writer every shooter every
administrative person every warehouse
person even every sales person is
absolutely integral to our process if
they weren't they wouldn't be here so
