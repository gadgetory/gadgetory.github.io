nexus tonight here at CES 2015 it's the
last day I'm sure you can tell because
I'm actually alive and ready to go here
we are at light shots booth this is some
pretty cool AR with lights on scene and
all kinds of stuff I'll tell you in a
second what we've got here is a group
called light shot their manufacturing
peripherals and other objects that
connect your phone your mobile devices
and you can effectively play games like
assassin which is sort of like an FPS or
humans vs zombies which many of you are
familiar with you can play those in real
life without the normal screen instead
you can connect into view our AR glasses
rather and and you can use your phone if
you if you're lacking the glasses so the
phone runs the games in this case we
have assassin open it is a free game in
its current state and then you've got
peripherals that you by backing the
Kickstarter campaign which just launched
a few days ago so the peripherals
include things like this this is a
detector that can be used for portals
responders for like a king of the hill
defense type of thing you set that on
the ground and then you defender capture
depending on what your plane and in the
game beseech you can play effectively a
fantasy RPG so you've got your standard
mage ranger warrior type of deal and
they all have their strengths weaknesses
just like most video games but of course
where it's unique is the fact that
you've got things like this which is a
bluetooth remote with a accelerometer in
it so you can actually use it for
casting spells for melee and things like
that and then for games like assassin
where you're running FPS you can fire an
IR gun and that uses an ir detector it
works with your phone in coordination to
find a our enemies or player enemies so
it actually will spawn a our enemies in
the game like zombies which will be
included in the humans vs zombies game
coming out and then we've got a stl
files included in the Kickstarter back
campaign that lights I was telling you
about pretty cool stuff you can print
out guns like this this may look
familiar to you that is because it is
very similar to a plasma rifle from Halo
and this just equips to the the
peripheral I was showing you a second
ago so that is light shot the link in
the description below if you need the
Kickstarter campaign all that
information will have a full article on
this and I
see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
