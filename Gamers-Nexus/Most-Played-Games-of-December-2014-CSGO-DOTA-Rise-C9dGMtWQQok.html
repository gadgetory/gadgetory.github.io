nexus net and we're taking a look at
raptors most play PC games of December
2014 so every month League of Legends is
the most played game by a considerable
margin but we had seen I believe in
November some of the play time had
dropped number two on the list is World
of Warcraft although you know it's
several spots behind league there has
been actually a surging gameplay since
warlords of Draenor has released so we
had almost a ten percent boost in time
spent on Wow in December and it's been
climbing since October a couple of valve
titles are coming in at number 3 number
4 respectively dota 2 and counter strike
global offensive there was a big
counter-strike sale during the holiday
period so that boosted playtime a lot
and as for dota 2 that playtime actually
went up by almost twenty percent Skyrim
has been on this list more or less for
the past three years and it's coming
back into the top 20 again this month
with a seventy eight percent increase in
playtime that's because the legendary
edition was on sale last month during
steams big blowout and then FIFA 15
that's right Sports goes back on the top
twenty fifty percent increase right
there lots of in-game holiday sales and
discounts and then looking at the games
that dropped out this list call of duty
advanced warfare payday 2 and spider
solitaire damn I was really pushing for
that one debt to climb in the rankings
so looking at what could be on the list
next month it's actually difficult to
determine that because there aren't
really any big pc releases for this
month looking ahead you had grand theft
auto 5 which was scheduled to come out
january twenty seventh and that would
probably get enough playtime from the
hardcore PC gamers out there that wanted
a copy of the game but now that's being
pushed back to march so you know we
can't expect that to be on there what
else is on the calendar there are a
couple of great games at the end of the
month that might not be enough to
actually make an appearance on this list
so looking at Grim Fandango remastered
from double fine we're looking at dying
light that's also January 27th lie
is strange which is january thirtieth
multi-platform adventure game there
isn't a triple a title alright said that
about does it for our december recap of
raptors most played pc games and don't
