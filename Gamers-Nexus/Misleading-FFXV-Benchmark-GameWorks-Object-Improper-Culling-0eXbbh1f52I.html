to render this or this or this or this
or this tunnel or this piece of road or
this large hairy animal this benchmark
is rendering creatures that use hair
works even when they're miles away from
the character and the camera we
discovered this while running benchmarks
in a zone with no hair whatsoever zero
none at which point we realized by
accessing the game settings files via a
hack that disabling hair works would
still improve performance even when no
hair works objects were on the screen
before that this video is brought to you
by thermal Grizzly makers of the
conductor not liquid metal that we
recently used to drop 20 degrees off of
our temperatures thermal grizzly also
makes traditional thermal compounds we
use on top of the IHS like cryo not and
hydro not pastes learn more at the link
below so that was a cowl we showed you
or something and it wasn't an accidental
cow either
that doesn't mean it's a malicious cow
but it's not accidental we even found an
LOD line drawn across the map where you
can see the transition of details so
Square Enix has marked this space as
being clearly not visible to the player
and yet still way beyond the boundaries
of this line miles away we see the cows
in full detail complete with fur there
are also examples of : present in the
game there are examples of selective
removal of unseen objects there are
examples of LOD scaling and yet here we
are with our friends the hairy cows
rendered in full detail this
investigation derived from just an
innocent game works benchmark when we
found a guide online to disable various
settings manually because the benchmark
doesn't allow you to do that out of the
box and what happened was we found that
in our 90 second benchmark that we had
been running for game works
there was no instance of hair works in
that 90 seconds it was cut intentionally
that way because the next 30 seconds
involved the hairy mammals in the game
that used hair works so the idea was
we'll benchmark all these other game
work settings in the first 90 seconds
and then we'll get the hair work stuff
later what we found though was that when
disabling hair works without ever
encounter
something that uses hair works we were
still seeing a performance deficit on
both nvidia and AMD cards it's actually
quite significant
even for nvidia they see frame time and
consistency pop up from hair works being
enabled when there's nothing with hair
works being drawn i just really want to
drive that point home so this is where
it gets kind of interesting because it
makes the benchmark disingenuous it's
it's not really something we can base
anything off of because it's not
realistic to what the user is probably
going to experience when the game
launches and it's fun 100 gigabyte form
what's more interesting is that the
nvidia cards as expected have a hit of
about 15% from hair works the AMD cards
as expected have a hit of about 37% from
hair works now it's expected because
hair works is ultimately an nvidia thing
they optimized for it they've had access
to the game probably for longer at least
closer access to it so not necessarily
crazy what's crazy is that this is a
technology not being used to enhance how
the game looks in its present state in
our current camera position and yet
we're still seeing massive hits the
extent of which is basically two acts on
AMD hardware and the improper use of
hair works and the improper culling of
things that shouldn't be there isn't
necessarily Nvidia's fault they're not
the developers after all but they do
have their name all over the box and the
game so they have some level of
responsibility here to ensure that
things work we've been in contact with
nvidia over this issue and know that the
company is looking into it for now it
seems like square-enix didn't add the
buffalo to the list of things that
should be occluded or removed and it's
something which has detrimental
performance impact we even validated
that the grass is specifically using
turf works just to make sure that hair
works wasn't being used to make grass or
something like that and the only thing
that might use hair works would be the
characters and we know that the
characters aren't using hair works
presently for two main reasons
one there's no dynamic movement of the
hair as the characters move and two by
using Nvidia Ansel yes intentionally we
actually intentionally used Ansel we can
fly into the character's head and see
that the hair is being drawn by using
alpha textures the hair is attached to a
plane
the characters head similar to how
leaves are attached to trees meanwhile
looking inside the Buffalo we see the
individual strands of hair protruding
from the body clearly indicating hair
works integration and indicating that
it's even working we can toggle it on
and off and see that there is a distinct
difference in how the Buffalo looks with
it toggled on and off via that settings
file let's look at some charts for some
basic examples before even getting into
the details of the comparisons this
chart of relative performance scaling
with game works shows how AMD GPUs and
NVIDIA GPUs are affected unequally by
game work settings the Vega 56 card
maintains 66.3% of baseline 100% of the
gtx 1070 performance at 1080p high and
when we completely disable game works
something that typically is impossible
while still maintaining equal graphics
settings we see that the vega 56 card
manages to maintain now 90% of the GTX
10 70s performance hikes from a 66%
baseline that's a massive gain and one
that illustrates uneven performance
scaling for perspective and video cards
scale with one another almost one-to-one
on this same chart as for what
specifically causing the biggest
performance hits that award goes to hair
works the single disablement of which
grants Vega a massive performance spike
turf is the next most responsible and is
what Square Enix is using for its grass
technology as for a terrain tessellation
our initial hypothesis for it was
actually completely wrong because we had
hypothesized that the tessellation of
the ground was impacting performance the
most noticeably potentially causing the
biggest performance disparity for AMD
who have historically had issues with a
lot of tessellation although they've
improved recently the reason that's
wrong is because by disabling that we
see very little difference in
performance on a and the end Nvidia it's
1 to 3 FPS different and it scales
equally and linearly on both so when you
disable it you can see the terrain kind
of pushed down as the tessellated
elements are pulled up so it's there and
you can turn it on and off very clearly
but it just doesn't impact performs like
we thought it might now we would have
never known that without the ability to
change the graphics settings and that's
entirely
thanks to the users on reddit who made a
utility that makes it pretty easy to
change their settings so we thank you
for that contribution it's very
upsetting that Square Enix didn't
provide something like that because the
entire point of a benchmark is to allow
people to rather transparently look at
the game and figure out how it performs
with different graphics hardware under
different conditions not to produce a
poison set of data that has users
aggregate from all over the place with
all different hardware configurations
all different CPUs into one big pool of
charts on their own Square Enix website
which is completely invalid because
there's zero control whatsoever and
further not having the ability to change
settings means that until we found this
sort of exploit posted by others there's
no way to know what's causing the
performance disparities and that's
really important because it's important
to understand if it's something that can
even be fixed when the game launches so
anyway let's get to the FPS charts now
that are building the relative charge
this is the settings configuration we're
using for the benchmarks
we're toggling off game works under high
and we're leaving the default options
still enabled so basically when looking
at the charts what you need to
understand is that they are cumulative
from a high baseline the high preset
sets the game with all game works
options enabled except for VX AO which
is presently disabled them less manually
enabled and it does work and the shadow
library is also disabled so all the
things you're going to see on the chart
are the default all game works settings
on except VX AO and shadow libraries and
then disabling whatever the the test
setting is for that line item on the
chart even with game works completely
disabled the Vega 56 card is offering at
a 10% deficit to Nvidia that's not
completely unreasonable just note that
AMD is not free from anything here
either they have some optimization work
to do it's not all just Square Enix
but AMD has drivers planned for closer
to the game's launch so we'll revisit it
then ultimately though the frame time
performance is still undesirable under
all settings for AMD even with game
works completely disabled and AMD again
should be addressing that closer to
launch more importantly however
the performance Delta between the
various settings using just the native
1080p high settings with our 90 second
benchmark we recorded 38 FPS average
across multiple runs disabling turf and
hair works nearly doubled our framerate
giving some perspective as to the
perceived performance capabilities and
we don't encounter flow very much on the
benchmark till the very end so we can
ignore that for now terrain tessellation
also has much less impact than we
expected and versus baseline Andy is
gaining an insane 37 percent performance
by disabling hair works but leaving all
the other native gameworks technologies
enabled and video meanwhile gains about
15% from the same conditions and
enabling vxa Oh shadow libraries things
like that under the all game works on
category shows that the devices take a
further tumble but these settings appear
to be disabled by default so as for the
1070 then and videos handling of the
same settings first note that we
complained about frame times on both AMD
and NVIDIA cards in our GPU benchmark
showing that the company had trouble
processing its own game works features
without tripping over wide frame to
frame intervals
the result was occasional stutter and
more disparate frame creation time we
can finally illustrate this at baseline
our 0.1% lows we're at 21 fps although
higher than AMD's it's really not better
in terms of average to low relative
scaling disabling hair works
specifically grants us a major uplift in
frame time performance but just a
moderate one in average FPS the average
increases by 15% with a lows increasing
by more than 2x game works seems to be
hurting performance for no apparent gain
here aside from some grass detail and in
one location some hair detail and that's
the big question here it's completely
reasonable that gamers would worsen
performance on even on video Hardware
it's not like it's advertised as a free
performance booster its advertises
something to increase the apparent
fidelity of the game and that costs
resources so that's not the unreasonable
part as a consumer however you should
care about what you're getting for the
technology and just looking at the
benchmark which is not a full
representation of the final game mind
you but is being promoted as a
futility and people are buying devices
based on the results so that's what
we're criticizing now so as a benchmark
if you can enable these different game
works technologies and let's just ignore
the hair works magical cow that you
can't see feign if you're enabling them
and you can't really see a difference
but there's still performance impact
what are you doing why it's it's a
completely invalid benchmark because you
can't look at the numbers and this isn't
sublime any particular party but you
can't look at the numbers for something
that gives you no settings control you
can't disable those things unless you
figure out how and no one ever expected
that to happen and if you have no
settings control and you can't disable
things and you're forced to run on high
settings or medium settings it's not
knowing necessarily what those even do
then you really don't have a good idea
of what hardware's required to play the
game and there's no actual visible
advantage in a lot of the cases of this
technology in the benchmark that might
change it very well could ultimately
this is a 3.7 gigabyte download against
a game whose specifications call for a
100 gigabyte plus harddrive it is very
likely that none of these numbers will
apply to the final game and if they do
then that is indeed a very sad thing so
let's just talk about a few places where
we tried to find differences here hair
works obviously is functional it's a
little too functional because it's
applying globally and you get the
performance reduction everywhere but it
is functional you can see it on the cow
buffalo things tessellation however is
seen at the beginning of the game for
terrain tessellation you can see that
Square is pushing down the road and
pulling the rocks out as tessellated
elements there's no big impact on
performance at less than 2 FPS per card
even on AMD so it's something that you
can kind of see although it does go away
later in the benchmark but we'll see how
that acts in the final game
either way though this is a setting that
has some visual impact even if it's not
really all that necessary but there's no
real performance cost right now either
we looked at grass as well this one's
obvious they're taller blades and
strands but they don't seem to conform
to player movement to like in the
promised tech demo
maybe that'll come later either way it's
denser strands which we think might be
particle meshes and that's a versus
textures for grass on the ground the
result is that disabling turf works
gives a patch your Balder look to the
ground whether or not you think that's a
good look or a bad look or worth the
performance is entirely up to you
although Nvidia users don't have as much
to worry about we still plotted a six
point five percent deficit on the 1074
turf whereas AMD plotted a 12 percent
performance deficit flow is visible at
the very end of the benchmark where the
campfire is lit up so that one does
actually appear but it's not too common
and other than that VX AO is presently
disabled you can turn it on it's not
really that visible of a difference
unless you start zooming into things and
the shadow libraries also take a bit of
looking to really find the differences
so at the end of all this there's
rendering of unnecessary detail and
that's problem for a benchmark because
maybe the game ships like that maybe
they ship a game that renders everything
on the map when you're nowhere near it
ok it's representative in that case and
I apologize
but I do implore you to revisit your
development strategy that's probably not
how it's going to work though so it's
it's a useless benchmark in that regard
it's also a disingenuous benchmark and
misleading in the very least because
what you end up with is charts that
frankly make one vendor look a whole lot
worse than the other where there is
literally zero difference in what you
see on the screen that is fact you can
disable hair works you can enable hair
works and if you're standing anywhere
except for where the cows are maybe
maybe one other place in the game but
whatever it's a six-minute long
benchmark stand anywhere else except for
there you don't see the impact of hair
works but you're taking a massive
performance hit on the AMD cards and
even a performance it down to Nvidia is
just less so so just to kind of temper
that a little bit that's not to say I'm
videos being malicious but there is a
problem where either square-enix or
Nvidia or someone in between has a
benchmark that is not representative of
reality you're getting performance that
doesn't match the visuals that are
coming out of the screen so
proud to say we found this bug ourselves
you can find more information in the
article below as always we've been
working with Nvidia on this issue for a
few days now and the company is working
diligently with Square Enix in attempt
to resolve the issue
Nvidia didn't code the game but once
again they've got game works branded all
over it and considering how game works
can be controversial it's in their best
interest to work with Square to resolve
this and to our understanding that's
what's happening for now though this
benchmark is not valid in our opinion
and we will update you if and when that
changes more likely that will be with
the final release of the game not with
the current benchmark so for a game that
promises that it's a game based on
reality maybe not so much but yeah
that's that's how our discovery for this
one so just to kind of reiterate here
all the benchmarks we've done and
everyone else has done on Final Fantasy
15 are completely pointless because
ultimately what you're dealing with is
testing a benchmark utility that has
things like random pieces of road weight
way off in the map background being
rendered any way that are impacting
performance and yes they're being
rendered no it's not ansel interfering
with this or anything like that I mean
you could you can fly on the map and see
that Square Enix has LOD scaling lines
drawn on the ground like lines in this
head they have intentionally and
selectively absent objects it's not like
Ansel is reaching out into the game
libraries and finding the exact object
that was removed and pulling it in and
putting it right where it belongs that's
probably not that's almost certainly not
happening so we're fairly confident that
this is in fact an instance of overdraw
or of elements being drawn when they
really shouldn't be and that is at least
that is well probably largely on Square
Enix that said it's a benchmark utility
that they clearly rushed and pushed out
before it was ready and the game should
hopefully be different so we'll revisit
this topic then but for now just know
that the benchmarks really they're valid
insofar as the performance of the
benchmark utility if you want to know
how well you can run the benchmark
utility we've got you covered not a good
example though for how well you can run
the final game particularly
cuz you should probably be turning off
gamer at settings that you don't
actually see the effect of especially if
you're on AMD hardware but even on
NVIDIA hardware because again it's not
just AMD here NVIDIA has a frame time
hit for these settings too so you know
turn those things off but you can't in
the benchmark making it somewhat invalid
anyway it's parked up benchmark utility
