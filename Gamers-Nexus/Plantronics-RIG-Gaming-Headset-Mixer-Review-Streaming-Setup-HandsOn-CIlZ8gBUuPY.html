Nexus Don net and I'm joined by Paige
Spears aka Dino pillow hi everyone and
today we're reviewing the Plantronics
rig headset which is a headset plus
mixer in terms of specs there's a stereo
headset it's only two channels so I'm
like the the 780 for instance or just
7.1 channels this is two channels and it
is a $130 unit it comes with this mixer
very basic mix app that can accept a
dual inputs so you can do a microphone
input and headphone output from your
system or your console and then you can
also accept the phone and put or output
so if you want to plug your phone into
the mixer you can accept the phone calls
and sort of tune your game volume
accordingly and on that same note there
is there's individual control for game
sound and voice sound over chat sound so
if you want to mute your teammates while
you're the last number on your CSS team
you can do that with this mixer of
course there are plenty of other
software ways to do that but but this is
a hard fair way to do that then we've
got the comfort and sound quality so I'm
gonna let Dino pillow here talk for a
moment about comfort yeah um so I took
the Plantronics headset and the mixer
and I used it in the replacement of my
ass for a 50s that I've been using for
the last few years so I streamed with it
I gained with it and I made a youtube
content with it so I pretty much
replaced it did everything I would
normally do with the headset did not
find it to be very comfortable I don't
know if that's because I have a very
small head but I most of the weight of
the Plantronics sat on top of my ears so
when you tend to wear a headset for four
to six hours a day it really wore on me
I wear it when I'm gaming and wear when
I'm editing if I'm skyping my headset
stays on pretty much most of the day so
having something that's super
comfortable and really up long periods
of time was super important to me and
the Plantronics headset was not that the
overall design wasn't too uncomfortable
the padding on the ears is pretty nice
there was a lot of space but as far as
the weight and where it sat on my head
it really did not agree with me another
thing that I didn't really like about it
was the sound that I guess with my
teammates heard and my
to channel her I didn't like either the
I tend to sound very easily with the mic
pick me up and I was also a lot quieter
than I normally am I'm a very loud gamer
normally you have a hard time not
hearing me and on the on the note of
sort of nasally and put the again the
game con 780 which is also by
Plantronics that's what I use for all of
my gaming and and actually for all the
YouTube content so any youtube video
where there's voiceover that's that's
cut on top of the video for example my
forest game review you can hit that
below that is done by the 780 microphone
and it sounds pretty clear it's much
better than the Razer car carious I used
to use it's significantly better than
the rig the headset outputs on 40
millimeter drivers so pretty standard
driver size and it is a 20 Hertz to 20
kilohertz frequency range the to give
you an idea of other headsets the
Siberia v2 is a 16 or 18 to 28 kilohertz
range and and uses 50 millimeter drivers
but other than that pretty much all
headsets in the 50 to 100 dollar price
range are going to use 40 millimeter
drivers so pretty standard stuff they're
looking at audio quality it is pretty
flat sounding because it's just it's two
channels so it's not the Virtual
Surround you get with a 5.1 or 7.1
headset it doesn't have any dolby
features that you might find in a
higher-end sennheiser or 780 or Siberia
Elite or something like that which sort
of uses more of the the soundstage to
create a bigger boom and more of a
realistic natural sound and on the note
of natural sounds I think we had some
complaints there so I will let you take
that away yeah we were looking up some
other stuff about Plantronics a lot of
other people I guess mentioned that it
didn't sound very realistic which was
something that I could definitely get
behind as far as sound of it it I'm used
to having directional audio not having
that was really difficult having to rely
on other things in order to figure out
where enemies were and how to play and
doing all that stuff definitely was a
detriment also with the game sound the
voice make there are the channels that
you had as far as being able to adjust
the volumes you had a master volume so
you could make things super loud or
super soft but the individual volume
levels between the game sound and the
chat sound didn't have a whole lot of
variation
you went from loud
louder there was never any like super
soft Tsar completely just taking it out
entirely without turning down the entire
master volume I struggled with it in a
way that I wish I didn't but I wish
there was a little bit more variety as
far as the volume level settings in the
mixer the way I feel about it if you're
a PC gamer then you should really be
buying a PC headset because you probably
don't need a mixer you can you can pause
your game or a hit escape or whatever
exit the game and answer your phone if
it's that important you really don't
need to mix it in for an extra 50 or 70
dollars or whatever it costs as opposed
to just getting a 70 or $80 a very high
quality headset that focuses strictly on
audio instead of having these these
extra features that definitely take a
huge chunk out of the price console
cameras again it's it's awesome to have
the versatility of the rig because it is
accepted by every major console and PC
the Xbox one I don't think currently
supports mic input but it does support
normal output ps4 is compatible ps3 xbox
360 and of course PC they are all
compatible so it's pretty versatile in
that regard but again you're paying a
lot of money for that versatility so if
you seriously need a mixer my suggestion
is to look into maybe an Astros mixer or
other aftermarket mixer and or DSP or
something like that and and then buy a
higher quality headset with it you might
end up spending 200 bucks instead of 130
the razor Tiamat is actually 160 but at
the end of the day you're gonna be
happier you won't be replacing it in a
year if you don't need a mixer or if you
don't know why you would need a mixer
then really look at the logitech g930
it's wireless and has programmable
buttons it's also wired if you want that
look at the Plantronics game comm 780
again I keep saying that over and over
because it is my favorite headset
and then of course the Siberia v2 for a
similarly priced headset if you want to
look at something super high up so you
have a sort of a wall to compare against
them look at the Siberia elite I have a
video link below that you can check out
for that and actually all the products
are linked below I think that pretty
much rounds up our Plantronics rate
