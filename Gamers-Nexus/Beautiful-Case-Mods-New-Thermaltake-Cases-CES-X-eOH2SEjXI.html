axis that we're at thermaltake suite at
CES 2016 looking at some of the case mod
submissions for the case mod
invitational there are two winners here
this is the second place mod then
there's the first place model which is a
crazy tank thane we'll be looking at
momentarily both use the x9 case all
this content for CES 2016 is brought to
you by I by powers revolt to small
form-factor gaming PC so looking at the
cases here this is the x9 which we've
shown previously but the mods obviously
it's called the water mod and there's
some custom machining here going on with
the side panels the metal the mesh was
all removed from the x9 so you're just
looking at basically what's left of the
frame and the memory is pretty cool I
have not personally seen this memory yet
but it's got a cathode in there that has
this electric pulsing effect going down
the tube on the top of the RAM so that
is pretty neat that's from the effexor
memory group and other than that
everything's just pretty much the
standard multi SLI full ATX things that
you have in your everyday gaming
computer looking at the next case there
is a mod from Jesse Palacio and that is
the tank mod so it is literally just
it's a tank and there's some action
where the tank guns will fold upward
both guns fold up the front plate folds
up and it's all very heavy steel pretty
heavy duty stuff inside is the original
or what's left of the x9 chassis it's
basically just a frame at this point and
it is on its face it's been rotated a
bit and that's got a horizontal
motherboard orientation really no focus
on air cooling or anything like that
it's all liquid with the thermaltake
liquid cooling solutions and then some
thermaltake power supply and there with
an asus gtx 970 and we're not sure
exactly what the cpu is but it's some
kind of Intel CPU so those are the two
case mod Invitational mods so the next
thing we're looking at is part of
thermal takes actual offerings not just
case mods and the one primarily that I
wanted to focus on is the wp 200 and the
way these work it's the W line or series
and there's the main chassis that's the
W signifier and then p is the pedestal
and that is a separate unit that you can
stack with the w main chat
see that's similar to some of the
x-series cases we looked at last year so
the wp 200 is a five hundred and fifty
dollar what thermaltake is calling super
tower and its massive it's got actually
a system installed on either side almost
kind of mirrored and both in this demo
system are sli configurations on either
side of the motherboard tray or trays
and that's it's sort of like a server
chassis it's not really something you'd
be using as a mainstream builder or even
a low-end enthusiast again five hundred
fifty dollars but for server setups for
Nass setups for multi seek systems in
one case like a bigger version of the
fan tax many XL then the wp to hundreds
worth looking at we haven't obviously
tested or anything like that so thermals
not too sure of it thermaltake is big on
the mesh everywhere and fans everywhere
so I'm sure the thermals are generally
fine but we'll look at noise and
thermals and things like that if that
have the chance check the links in the
description below for more information
on the cases and other options from
thermaltake this year at CES 2016 we've
got all that detailed down below and
then hit that patreon link the postural
video if you want to help us out and
i'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
