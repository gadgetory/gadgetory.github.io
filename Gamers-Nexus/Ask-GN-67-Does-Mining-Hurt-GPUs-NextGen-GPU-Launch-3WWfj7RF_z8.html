of ask GN the first one for 2018 this is
a series where we answer questions from
viewers and readers you can leave yours
in the comment section below
or you can go to our discord on
patreon.com slash gamers nexus to join
the discord and then leave questions in
the ask en channel we've got a few good
ones this week about sort of predictions
which we try to stay away from but
predictions about how mining can damage
or if it damages PC components talk
about if it is possible to quote fry a
system from user error with regard to
thermals and a couple of other pretty
good ones in here as well PCIe lanes all
that kind of stuff so before we get into
that this content is brought to you by
the Thermaltake flow RGB closed-loop
liquid cooler which is a three hundred
sixty millimeter radiator plus three 120
fans that are RGB illuminated if then
we'll take it ringg fans at that this is
a 4.5 done a stack pump which is one of
the faster pumps you can learn more at
the link in the description below quick
announcement before the first question
we are going to be at CES in about one
week's time so we will be there the the
event sort of starts pre-show on Monday
ish there'll be a couple of meetings and
and pre-show announcements and embargo
lifts stuff like that
and then goes through about Saturday so
we'll be there for the event we mean
with pretty much every company that you
can think of that visit CES from the
computer hardware side and a couple of
other media outlets as well folks that
you watch on YouTube so we'll have lots
content make sure you're subscribed and
keep an eye out for all that it's a big
show for us we'll probably be doing two
to three videos a day on news
announcements while at the event and if
you see anything that you think is two
things here I'd like to request from you
during the event if you see anyone cover
something or you see tweets from
companies or whatever Facebook post by
companies if you see something really
cool that we haven't already covered
tweet it at gamers next as that is where
I am most likely to see it during the
show and we'll do our best to get over
there if you have I guess that's the
main thing really is
if you have requests let us know
especially if it's before the show
because now I can plan it better we've
got most of schedule planned already
first question comes from cluster
recluse for 1:3 who says what's your
honest guess for the gaming versions of
volt release frame would late Quarter 1
be likely
so disclaimer here I don't like to try
and predict things in the market for
releases we really don't have that much
more information than you so all I'm
doing here with Volta and quotes is I'm
going to give you some general ideas of
how Nvidia launches products and
generally when but that doesn't mean
they always abide by those timeframes
but that might be the one thing I can
offer that you may not already know so
first of all Volta will almost certainly
have large parts of it grafted into the
gaming architecture which we we think we
know the name of it but you can't talk
about that yet but the gaming
architecture is not going to be exactly
Volta as we know it today I don't know
what's going to be removed and what's
going to be added but it would be
reasonable to assume that Nvidia is
following the same the Lawtons design
philosophies for the gaming architecture
that would probably include for example
a focus on asynchronous compute
performance we saw a big uplift in Volta
I would suspect that'll carry through to
the gaming cards so that stated being
that this is not a direct v 100 or the
Titan B will not turn into an 1180 TI or
whatever it's going to be modified in
some form before then but the thing I
can tell you is that generally speaking
and video likes to launch in two primary
windows they tend to launch things
either at GT c or there abouts that
would be their trade show the graphics
or GPU technology conference that tends
to happen in May each year just before
Computex if they don't launch things
there they sometimes launch them near
GDC the Game Developers Conference
but a lot less often way less off I
think it's happened twice in the last
couple years so May would be the first
window to look at for something like
that at least an announcement normally
they announce it's changed its it's kind
of been alternating the last few years
they'll do a gaming architecture or a
gaming card and then they'll do a deep
learning card or architecture GTC has
been trending more towards the business
and enterprise side of things so I don't
know if we'll see the trend of gaming
cards being announced their continued
but they do like to announce things
either at their own show or at an event
near a main event but tends to be their
own show so that stated a direct answer
to your question I would say almost
certainly not quarter one but this is me
going off of just experience not off of
any special privileged information so I
don't know that much more than you
quarter one seems unlikely to me I think
a sort of mid-year launch is more
realistic typically and video looks at
either just before Computex or just
after four product launches the GTX 1080
was something like May 23rd or something
it was right before Computex and and
that tends to be what they do so sort of
that yeah there's really only two launch
Windows for flagships that companies do
it's it's basically May or it's like
August ish if it's not there then
they're doing something pretty different
from normally so yeah that's that's what
I got for you March was a bit anomalous
friend Vidya that was primarily because
AMD launched rising in March so they
want to put out a 1080i because they had
no competition for GPUs at that time so
they wanted to grab all that market
share from the rising system's next
question Sergio Gonzalez says the mining
of cryptocurrency can damage the PC
parts if you work in the same PC and
mining question work so let's look at
this from perspective of why do
components get damaged regardless of how
they are used
does it doesn't really matter that much
what kind of work
under they get damaged from heat heat
causes a few things he causes rapid
degradation of parts it is a catalyst
and he also causes things like fires so
in extreme scenarios you could have not
a fire like a house fire but a fire like
a component like a power component just
popping vrm pops it's kind of what you
would say so a good example would be a
capacitor capacitors a lot of them can
take about 105 degrees Celsius some of
the better ones might be rated for
10,000 hours at 105 C some of the
cheaper ones might be rated at 5000
hours for 105 C these are real numbers
for actual capacitors you find on boards
some of the B 3 actually a lot of the be
350 motherboards use 5 K capacitors at
that's at 105 C so if you're running
higher temperatures doesn't matter if
you're mining or not for prolonged
periods of time you could be eating away
at the lifespan of those components you
are far more likely to chew away at the
lifespan of capacitors than a MOSFET
unless it's a bad batch of MOSFETs or
bad batch of power components like EVGA
encountered with their a CX card just a
little over a year ago at this point and
that's unlikely though generally you're
looking at other component failures VRMs
vrm components like chokes and MOSFETs
can take 125 150 C really before they
start D rating hard so yeah caps would
be the thing to look at and this comes
down to how the coolers design so each
card is going to be different cards that
don't have a good heatsink contact to
those power components are going to be
under a lot more duress so if you have
cards that you can adjust adjust the fan
speed to keep the GPU core temperatures
low they're not cooling the power
components you can still have a
catastrophic failure and when they fail
primarily will hinge on how hot those
components get that are rated for lower
temperatures like capacitors 105 C is
relatively low compared to other power
components so it's it's not going to be
an instantaneous fail
another source of failure we've seen so
I was looking at some photos of mining
machines that had burst a flame
via Twitter and if you look at a lot of
those they tend to fail from overdraw on
the power cables so that's a scenario
where you are either exceeding the
current rating of the power supply for
that rail or you are exceeding the
current rating for what the gauge of the
wire can withstand if you're using and
this is true outside of mining as well
so if you're doing high-end overclocking
with power mods or hard mods on the card
like we did with Vega 56 if you were to
then take a smaller gauge wire that's
not rated for as much current and plug
it in there's a chance you could burn
out the wires and hopefully you have a
good power supply that can help deal
with that sort of thing but that's
generally a type of failure you see is a
overdraw or power component failures it
is possible for the GPU or the memory to
burn out but unless you've modified the
card in a way that has interfered with
the contact of those components like HBM
to the cooler it's pretty unlikely the
card has protections to throttle itself
once it gets warmer unless you enter a
runaway thermal scenario where you've
got racks and racks with these things
and they're in a high ambient operating
environment 4050 C unless you're in that
scenario ice power components are still
where you look for a failure and then
after that probably fans how many hours
the fans are waiting for you're running
fans at high speeds for long periods of
time you're gonna chew through they're
rated lifespan a lot faster and when
fans fail other components will fail
unless they have a mechanism built in to
trigger a shutdown which I don't I can't
name a card current gen that does that
so yeah there's the main things that
fail this is it's a really interesting
topic and it's probably worth a
completely separate video with some
testing because I've done some testing
on this kind of stuff so I will leave
that there for sake of getting to other
questions and there's a lot I've left
out here
I'm sure there's stuff that I'm not
thinking about right now that we could
include or talk about in the future but
we got a roll through some more
questions so if you are interested in
that topic more not just cryptocurrency
mining but hardware failure from load in
general let us know and we'll look into
it I'll note one more thing here with
regard to any amount of sustained load
whether that's 3d rendering or mining
you can stay a lot of the keep a lot of
the the negative effects at bay by
modifying the card with just a simple
power offset if you tell us to draw
something like 70% of its power it is
going to draw well below what it's rated
to handle those power components should
be if you've left it unmodified and it's
not a terrible terrible cooler design
they should be fine so if you are really
concerned about your rendering machine
or your mining machine or whatever with
high thermal environments if you're
concerned about it burning up consider
lowering the power target increase the
fan speeds make sure there's direct
cooling on the back of the card or
somewhere to get rid of radiative heat
off the back side of it and then you can
of course tune clocks if you had to from
there but under volting of course also
an option although that doesn't really
work that easily a lot of the time
especially with Nvidia cards but easier
to do through power play tables so yeah
that's that's some basics for you but
the thing to take away here is that heat
is the catalyst for everything bad in
computers it's or unclean power I
suppose you can pretty much solve all of
the things you'd be concerned about with
good cooling solutions and with good
power supplies and that I once you've
done that there's not much more you can
do if you have fire concerns a good
power supply will solve a lot of those
and cooling will keep the heat away
because heat causes fire and it's not
like it's not as literal as how high of
a temperature do you need for metal to
catch on fire because it's really
freakin high it's more a question of
what is catalyzing from that heat what
what's going on what chemicals are
breaking down what power components are
starting to fail and then what is there
catastrophic failure mechanism is it
popping is it like bursting into a puff
of smoke and brief flame pretty uncommon
things you don't really need to worry
about them but that would be kind of the
the catastrophic failure I think you're
talking about you don't really have vrm
components when they fail it's not like
you start getting an artifact ting you
don't just start seeing memory artifacts
or texture artifacts in your graphics it
just dies it goes black dies shuts down
whatever
there's no gradual failure of the RM
component it's just gone so that's kind
of I think that that should give us a
good starting place to look into more
later I really like that topic a lot of
what we do is based around it like
thermal testing power testing so I would
love to talk about it more next question
is from honey force who says Steve is it
possible to irreparably fry a system
through heat by gross user error like
not using thermal paste forgetting to
plug in a pump or fan and then gaming
I'm pretty sure there are some built-in
protections but can't recall hearing a
trustworthy answer not true at
differences between short and long term
exposure pretty sure there are average
consumers out there who throttle for
months before has a need to clean the
heatsink etc so a lot of the previous
answer feeds into this one so that's
helpful but briefly I've done a couple
of these things in the past a really
common one is forgetting to plug in
these SATA coming off of like NZXT crack
and coolers because then your pump
doesn't turn on you notice fast because
it'll throttle hard the tubes get
physically hot to the touch things like
that there are built-in protections not
every BIOS and CPU behaves the same you
can often configure them at least in the
higher-end board common failure modes
would be when t.j.maxx is hit on the cpu
which would be your junction temperature
maximum that's what the J is this
Junction temperature as opposed to case
temperature so this is more or less than
inside the CPU temperature as opposed to
an external probe or sensor so Junction
temperature when you hit max 105 C on X
299 stuffs HTC PI corrigan CPUs when you
hit max
on that your motherboard will dictate do
I shut down or do i throttle oftentimes
it's it's the latter its throttle and so
have it throttles you're just gonna lose
performance drop clocks hard it'll go
down to 12 and then 45 and 12 45 over
and over and over again for the
multiplier and you'll notice that
another option for failure is a thermal
shutdown that's just cuts off goes black
that's it so those are a little annoying
for even if you're an experienced user
I've had thermal shutdowns recently on
production systems that I've used and
it's not always easy to troubleshoot it
because it just goes black so you don't
necessarily know what caused it you
might think it's something else first as
for the question is it possible to
damage stuff through gross user error
certainly it is if you run a GP a GP is
a great example because it will not
cause the entire system to shut down
unless there's something really wrong so
a GP it might be a scenario where your
maybe you reassembled your heat sink and
properly there's poor contact something
like that if that is overheating and
it's still trying to operate at full
capacity okay better example the heat
sink contact to the die is perfectly
fine and it's keeping it cool but
something's wrong with the contact of
the VRMs there's no mechanism in there
short of erm throttling if they have
something that will keep them cooler as
opposed to the core if the core is
running too hot it will throttle itself
to a point maybe down to even two D
clocks if it gets bad enough but the the
short of it is a GPU or component like
that is more likely to have some kind of
frying using your word than something
like a CPU the motherboard VRMs could
also be damaged the damage tends to come
in the form of loss of lifespan of
things like capacitors refer to the
previous answer but yeah it's always
possible to cause damage from heat you
try to avoid those scenarios but also if
you've already had a scenario where you
forgot to plug in the pump for a while
or something like that
I wouldn't stress about it I mean if you
if you realize the error and fixed it
and it seems like everything's okay just
just move on there's nothing you can do
at this point if some damage has been
caused
you might not know for years if it was
just a capacitor overheating or
something like that
if serious damage was caused immediately
to the component you would know you'd
get artifact in or you might not be able
to sustain the overclock that you
previously sustained that's a pretty
common one for people who overdo their
asset their system agent voltage sa
voltage or also known as VC CSA or if
you are running a be 350 board with a
high capacitor temperature you'll
eventually start getting degradation or
I should say hi mom spent temperatures
get degradation of the overclock so
those are things to keep in mind as well
but yes it's possible it's just yeah you
have to really do it pretty bad have
that happen quick note here Ivan I wrote
down a note for myself to address this
one so for our content we were
diagnosing the Titan XM where I took
apart two hybrid coolers to liquid
coolers during the diagnosis a lot of
people were like there are two comments
I wanted to address one is why did you
destroy two perfectly good CLC's for
this and the other one was why didn't
you just weigh them so let's talk about
why did you destroy first I did not
destroy them you can refill them they're
fine also separately that's kind of our
job there are a few reasons I would
disassemble to liquid coolers so the
contacts here is we took about two
liquid coolers and measured the amount
of liquid in them for a permit a very
quick ad-hoc permeation test it wasn't
that scientific and the reason you do
that one is so you have a baseline you
understand how much liquid are we
expecting from a new unit to let's say
we thought there was a problem with the
first one and I just say I think that it
permeated there should be more liquid
well if I'm wrong
odds are that is a specific enough test
that someone else probably won't check
it for a while and you don't want to be
wrong and how people believe something
false or inaccurate about a company's
product because that's not fair so it
makes
to take apart a second one and sacrifice
it or in this case just empty it and
refill later to make sure that we were
correct at least sample size of two is
small but it gives you some redundancy
just to say you did due diligence to
make sure you're not hurting a product's
reputation when it shouldn't be hurt so
that's part of it the other part is
again my job is to review components not
to amass them and use them personally so
it's it's not like it's not wasteful to
take them apart it's part of the job and
it's you know it's it's not like that
component would have gone to you for
free if we didn't do it so it's really
not any loss other than making sure the
contents somewhat accurate next question
why did you not weigh it weighing the
coolers assumes a lot of things
primarily it assumes that the the
manufacturing tolerance is very tight no
error because if we weigh them both
empty you're probably going to find
disparity just in the radiator just in
the tank the the liquid is a mixture of
glycol and distilled water it's possible
that those mixtures changed between runs
it's possible that the well really a lot
of things a cold plate comes from
another supplier that's not a static or
evj in that case so that could have
changed the mass of that could have
changed there are a lot of really small
things and there's going to be tolerance
for all these whether or not they
actually change the run yeah look take
something really minor look at Noctua
they had that fan controversy last year
with the China versus Taiwan made fans
that was a color change and it's because
the factory ran out of pigment or
whatever color for the first one and
they made another batch and it was
slightly off
that's just color so that's why we don't
I didn't weigh it cuz didn't really need
to and also side note I need to see if
the cold plate was gunked-up or if there
was a gunk in the tubes or anything like
that
next one here mega scrapper what will
happen if you use a modern desktop CPU
without any heatsink will that thermal
throttling esily or will it simply
refuse
turn on because there's no cooler
detected this was aggravated by mark
wolf in the comments so they will
generally turn on we've done it actually
some motherboards do have pressure
detection where they'll refuse to boot
or shut down if the inadequate pressure
is detected but we did this with thread
Ripper we actually turned when we first
got threader before we turned it on
without a heatsink so we take a
thermographic image of with like we had
Sharpie dit out so there was no
emissivity issue but we took a thermal
graphic image of the IHS which allowed
us to see which spots were active which
then allowed us to see which dyes were
active as opposed to the other two which
are silicon substrate interposers and
and determine back then the question was
are all four active or are two of them
what people called dummy dyes also known
as silicon substrate interposers and
that allowed us to do that so the answer
the question is you can still turn it on
but it will eventually shut down or get
dangerously hot and depending on where
you are in the boot cycle it might not
protect you from that next question
Judas says a Judas Iscariot says it's
kind of ridiculous that they're
launching new products called risin plus
or whatever that's effectively the same
product but fixing the platform issues
memory compatibility better clocks etc
of the original rise in line I wanted to
address this one because I can
understand product segmentation to a
degree it gets a little ridiculous
sometimes see end video with their
recent data center decision but this
kind of product segmentation i wanted to
talk about even from our perspective
taking an existing products that you
have and then trying to find a way to
reuse it and build upon it makes a lot
of sense fab plants can cost upwards of
five billion dollars andy is technically
fabulous now so they don't have that
cost but they still spend a whole lot of
money doing R&amp;amp;D nvidia brags about
spending a billion dollars on R&amp;amp;D
you spend that kind of money you can't
just launch one product and
you're not gonna profit on it and take a
micro look at it from our perspective we
do a lot of testing there are times when
actually a lot of the time you don't
want to throw out all your data so what
do you do okay we we test all these GPUs
for a review so we have a review
coverage piece we can do and then maybe
after that we can do a separate
overclocking piece maybe after that we
can do an SLI piece and you can do stuff
like explicit multi-gpu with two
different cards and you have all this
comparative data that you kind of a mass
over time so you're able to reuse large
portions of that to get a profit on a
huge upfront expense which would be the
initial review because otherwise it's
simply not profitable and from a much
larger zoomed out perspective your
company like AMD or Nvidia or Intel you
have billions of dollars of expenses
yeah you probably want to launch an
iterative step afterward not just go
full new architecture and also keep in
mind that fab process the the shrinks
the process shrinks are not as common as
they used to be and they're getting a
lot more difficult so if they want to
stay in business like how to keep
launching product yes it is it can get
to a point where it is anti-consumer
certainly but that's not always the case
it's just you have to judge it product
by product and make sure it's not
something that screws you over the the
real question is does this version of
the product add something meaningful
over the previous version and could they
have added that to the previous version
just as easily depending on the answer
there you can kind of decide an example
of segmentation that kind of makes sense
is professional GPUs versus gamer GPUs
where you're dealing with things like
certified drivers professional support
and product segmentation specifically
with high-end enterprise products to try
and make back your money at licensing
fees do that to a degree as well or
licensing rather not licensing fees I
don't like the idea of imposing a EULA
to force users to use a product certain
way companies don't generally tell you
how to use the product but it's part of
the game ideally that particular
the game doesn't exist but there are
reasons for for this type of product
launch to happen and that's just you
know not taking andis side on it or
anything but just realistically all the
companies will need to do that just like
look at cases ninety percent of the
cases that you've probably seen in the
last year share tooling it can cost a
company six hundred thousand dollars a
tool case and they got to make money on
it so they're gonna do that by reusing
that tooling alot and changing the shell
and the injection molding on the outside
or backing or whatever they use let's do
one more last one there's a lot of good
questions I'll do two more quick one
David says this might be slightly off
topic how does your usual upload look at
the impression that a lot of the smaller
youtubers spend some time in the comment
section like and responding to comments
after the upload is that true yeah I
think objectively you can look at it and
it's true we do it for a few reasons one
of them is because I like to try and
encourage interaction in the community
that is hopefully more meaningful than
just memes and jokes things like that I
try to keep the signal-to-noise ratio as
clean as possible and as you grow it's
it's more and more difficult to do that
and I'm okay with chasing away people
who don't really belong here if that
means we can sustain a community that is
more mature and more focused on product
analysis and you know development and
engineering and all that stuff I'm okay
with making sure our audience is focused
there and being in the comments helps a
bit also give us ideas it helps me know
if we need to make a correction or
anything like that but yeah we spend
some time there the next one there are
so many options okay so let's do this
one quickly
Ryan Frick says our number of PCIe lanes
available a limitation of the CPU or the
motherboard that went and Paul made a
comment in passing about the rise in 400
series chipsets possibly supporting more
PCIe lanes
I thought rising CPUs were limited to
have less available compared to Intel
processors very very quickly because I
don't want to spend a lot of time on it
at this point but we'll talk about this
more in the future
very quickly the CP on the chipset both
have PCIe lanes for 400 series chipsets
what probably what Paul and Kyle were
talking about I didn't watch it but I
would assume they were talking about the
PC is IG changes to the 400 series
chipset those would include moving the
general-purpose PCI Express Lanes these
would be lanes you can assign to
anything as a motherboard maker it is
your choice to say you know what let's
pull these four lanes off and give them
to a Gigabit Ethernet controller let's
pull a might not take four lanes but
just an example let's pull these lanes
give them to MDOT - let's pull these
give it to you got to pull a whole bunch
of them give them the SATA Express or
whatever so it's their choice
400 series is going to jet generation 3
for the general purpose lanes
I think there's 8 of them as opposed to
generation 2 so they are going to be
roughly 2 times the bandwidth per Lane
and therefore you could pull half the
lanes to achieve the same thing as 2
times the lanes previously so if
previously you need it as a make
motherboard maker four lanes to achieve
a certain speed on your MDOT 2 device
now you built two gen 3 general purpose
lanes and achieve the same speed so
that's the change that's happening my
account is primarily dictated by the CPU
that is what communicates directly with
the PCI Express interface and it's
slots that are hosting your graphics
devices and that's dictated by the CPU
it also has some generation two lanes
depend on which one you're looking at
the PCIe lanes on the chipset go to all
the other high-speed IO devices HS IO as
Intel calls it and those are divvied up
in a lot of ways but for Intel the PCIe
lanes on the chips that can never be
assigned in greater than groups of four
to a particular device so you can't
assign chipset lanes to a graphics
device and have it be by eight it would
have to be by four which means that if
you're powering crossfire you're fine
but if you're powering SLI off of as
e200 series CPU which has
remember right now but 24 lanes I want
to say something like that it's off top
of my head but it's not 32 lanes
basically so you would have to do an
honest a lie you'd have to be limited at
two cards for SLI you can't do by four
for SLI but that's the very basics of it
there's a lot more here as well
I'll save the rest of these questions
and we'll do another one we will do two
this week or something CES is coming up
after all thanks for watching as always
you can subscribe for more if you'd like
to help us out directly you got a
patreon are complex gamers Nexus or you
gonna store it on game designs it's not
net slash mod matte let's think about
mod matte like this one I'll see you all
