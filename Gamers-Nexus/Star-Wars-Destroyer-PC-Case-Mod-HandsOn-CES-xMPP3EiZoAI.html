Donette and we're here at the msi suite
or booth rather at CES 2016 and behind
me I have pretty obviously a Star Wars
destroyer so this is actually a case mod
but before we get to that all the
coverage brought to you by IO powers
revolt 2 a small form-factor gaming PC
so for this case mod obviously Star Wars
inspired destroyer the plastic is all 3d
printed on the outside that's a PLA
material and the printing time was 250
hours more or less
total build time was around 400 hours
maybe a bit more and then the frame
underneath the plastic is an aluminum
frame in the sides here there's quite a
bit of fiber-optic cabling with manual
drilling through for the lighting and
then internally which you'll see in the
b-roll is the MSI motherboard the V 150
M mortar and a top that the 780ti
lightning video card with an i5 6600 K
CPU inside of there so Thermaltake
cooling it's all open-loop liquid
there's a 480 millimeter radiator right
behind me here and that's pretty massive
radiator toward the back of the ship I
feel like we're doing like a car unveil
video toward the back of the ship is the
power supply and just beneath that in
the the jet engine equivalent are the
reservoirs for the open-loop liquid
cooling so this is an msi suite or booth
here at the CES 2016 show the system as
I understand it is currently up on for
auction on eBay so if you really want it
you can check it out there we were
talking about maybe making it our new
test bench but it might be a bit out of
budget for the show here today so that
is all for the Star Wars destroyer case
mod and you can check out more
information about the mater about the
mod itself and the link in the
description below hit that patreon link
if you want to help us out in the post
roll video and I'll see you all next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
