probably shows the clearest trend of the
current direction of the industry
Silverstone is a longtime function over
form company and given that their last
year of cases were pretty damn
functional the primary pm0 one and the
red line are l06 are two of the chart
toppers on our bench and have remained
that way for a full year now and largely
uncontested and that is in a sea of
cases that use a flat front panels
Silverstone now is feeling some pressure
from its competitors in the industry and
as such they've attempted to keep some
of the function via ventilation while
still closing off a bit of the front
panel to try and grab some of that
market segment that so desperately wants
a closed-off front before that this
video is brought to you by thermal
Grizzly makers of the conductor not
liquid metal that we recently used to
drop 20 degrees off of our temperatures
Thermal Grizzly also makes traditional
thermal compounds for use on top of the
IHS like cryo knot and hydro not pastes
learn more at the link below so this is
the PM 0-2 now to establish some history
here Silverstone's redline 0-6 is a case
that we've really liked it is probably
one of the best cases it's definitely
one of the best cases under $100 and
might be the my go to case under 70 or
at 74 the redline 0-6 Pro and that's
because it's one of the best coolers it
looks decent it has three or four fans
and I think for stock with the pro
version and it cools really damn well
and that's because it's got a mesh front
and a lot of fans and the interesting
thing is whenever you have a focus on
air flow if noise is a concern because
there's so much airflow there you can
just slow down the fans and you really
get a good trade-off overall for both
noise and for cooling performance the
pmo one we also have a history with we
use it for our render machine and it's
similarly very good at cooling this case
caused a bit of skepticism among us when
we first saw it at Computex and later
CES because the front panel now it loses
that metal mesh that the PMA one had and
the
our l06 have and instead goes for a sort
of dotted pattern design on the front
that creates some airflow but is
definitely still going for an aesthetics
market and if you look at it the holes
actually thin out a bit towards the
bottom which does impact GPU cooling
performance and overall you just have
less area for air to get through so this
is exactly what happens when the
industry goes crazy over closed off
fronts you have companies like
Silverstone that have been just die hard
function first finally dipping their
toes into the water of this and then
this year people are starting move back
to airflow based on what we saw at CES
so it's it's this is an instance where
Silverstone's sort of latent arrival to
market is interesting because they were
so far behind the design curve and
that's not a bad thing there was so far
behind the design curve and the fads in
the industry through 2017 that they
ended up being a head for cooling
reforms and for the new fad in 2018
unfortunately that cycle is now taking
over and they're getting into the design
focus look at the red line zero set like
can we put the RL zero seven on screen
for a second because Silverstone please
I've tried to I've tried to talk to the
people at Silverstone about this but
here's the thing this is not this is not
a rant about bad case design right now
it's not what this is what this is is a
rant about marketing and establishing a
product and I've tried to tell
Silverstone's reps this a few times now
I really want to make it clear publicly
that Silverstone has established a
really strong reputation with the red
line of six and the PMO one it's not
just us a lot of reviews out there and
individuals who've purchased the cases
know that they're really good at airflow
in a market with very little good
airflow cases so then it's okay to have
a case like this where it's slightly
closed off it's got a more artsy focus
it has this cool LED in the bottom that
shines down the Silverstone logo you can
really easily modify it for your own
that's fine it's okay to have that
the red line no.7 it's okay to have that
it's it's a bit it's got more dramatic
curves and the flower angles in the
front it's not a cooling case but it
there's a market for it however the part
I take issue with is changing two
product lines that haven't established a
legacy that silverstone has worked so
hard to build up in a market where
frankly silver stones had a lot of
trouble getting a foothold in Western
markets you don't see a lot of their
cases recommended not with folks like
Corsair and NZXT a Coolermaster these
bigger names and Western markets whether
it's because they just simply spend more
on ads and so you see their cases more
or because they make more cases and they
push harder and market harder to the US
audience so silver stones had trouble
getting a foothold there the redline and
the PM series finally established like a
clear line in the sand to say look in
the face of all this foolishness and
nonsense about design we are cases that
you can trust for air flow and then
they've taken those product lines and
they've done the opposite with them the
red line no.7 is probably the most
egregious case of this again it's hard
to say dollar 7 or the PMO too can't
exist it's just to say that really once
you've worked so hard to build up a
brand name for a particular product line
keep it keep RL or PM as a an airflow
focused case people have learned to
expect that from the last year of those
cases so that's kind of what I wanted to
say up front is keep the names
consistent this is something silverstone
has had a longtime problem with their
naming scheme and frankly very very
seriously i think it contributes to
silverstone sort of slower or latent
pickup in western markets and i love
some of the cases that silverstone makes
but it's just that naming and that
marketing is making it harder for them
to catch on in the way that some of them
should it's not like a product fault
it's everything else that goes into
pushing the product so anyway this is
the new one this is the PMO - it
was the PMO one which is one of the best
cooling cases we've tested in the last
year as such it has a bit of a legacy
with it and being the successor to the
PMO one means we've got some things we
expect the design is really
significantly different the only thing
that truly similar is well in terms of
the overall big picture stuff is the
fact that it's still got three front
fans and it still has a rear fan there
140s three in the front one at the top
or a back rather other space in the top
for fans it loses that sort of phantom
esque design that the PMO one had where
it's got the big plastic panel that
domes out a plastic front with the big
metal mesh on it these are huge design
changes for the PMO to really looks a
lot different if they've gone to a metal
top not removable now rather than a top
plastic panel so they've eliminated the
plastics which is also a trend and
probably a good one but also changed the
overall look of the take the case and a
lot of the function of it with that
aside from that internally pretty
standard motherboard layout there could
probably be another cutout for cable
management on the top of the power
supply shroud that would be nice
it could probably be better cut out
placement for an eight pin in the top
but also not bad the way it is now and
it's got a bear layout with the hard
drive cage is located under the power
supply shroud also pretty standard for
current design trends also frees up some
space for air to move around a bit
better so it's got some things going for
it it's got some things against it but
this isn't the worst front panel we've
ever seen
so we'll have to test it and see how it
actually does because ultimately it
still breathes a lot better than most
the cases on the market and depending on
how those fans can fight that front
metal fill we'll see how well it does
now before that I want to read some of
Patrick's notes from his build process
and his written review which you can
find linked below
Patrick noted about appearances that
appearance-wise the PMO too has almost
nothing in common with the PMO one the
most obvious difference is that front
panel elimination solar stone describes
its primary line as pioneering computer
cases with exceptional style and
functionality that's a direct quote
so the connecting theme here seems to
there are some of Silverstone's nicer
cases that don't necessarily fit into
the Ravens series depending on your
opinion of mesh great the o1 looks
either a little old-fashioned or
cutting-edge this is one instance where
lagging behind current case trends has
put Silverstone ahead of their
competitors almost unintentionally so
the version we tested this time is the
PMO one RGB which comes with a glass
side panel and RGB LEDs but it's
functionally identical to the base model
it's huge it has a deep top and front
panel and it scopes the profile of a
case and the style of old towers like
the Thor The Phantom or similar cases
from a few years ago this is in contrast
to the o2 which has a smaller and more
stripped-down design with a flat panel
and no removable top it's modern but
that doesn't necessarily translate to
good or bad that's up to you building in
the PMO one was already fairly easy
thanks to the large interior but
Silverstone has made some improvements
in the PMO to a good thing the glass
side panel now uses it to old-fashioned
thumb screws together with metal hooks
at the bottom and that's as opposed to
the zero ones for thumb screws both of
these cases use protective rubber
washers that wedge into the glass which
is a minor detail but prevents them from
falling out and rolling away as they
tend to do on other cases the PMO to the
other side panel is unexcited but it
differs from the PMO ones in an
important way every single time we build
in the PMO one is practically impossible
to probably the metal panel off the side
the PMO one also has an optional Flaming
unicorn graphic on the metal panel
whether that's good or bad is subjective
of course but there really isn't a
removable top panel on the OT other than
a magnetic filter that's probably for
the best
silverstone went overboard with the
number of screws in the o1 and it makes
it a hassle the top mount fans and
radiators so they've improved their
ignoring airflow concerns for a moment
the o2 front panel does look good
subjectively it's made of a thick and
heavy steel and has some plastic it
doesn't flex at all when it's pried off
the fasteners are a ball joints and the
kind that hold the side panels of the
define r6 on which makes it easy to
remove and clean the filter without
breaking the clips a problem we've had
with the plastic clips and the
asked so there's been a few improvements
but let's move now to thermals the PMO
too takes the same for fan brute-force
approach to cooling that the PMO one and
redline zero six did it's got three
intake and one exhaust just without the
matched panel we have too many cases
really at this point and the reason we
chose the primary oh one for multiple
builds was it's mesh front we can add
fans but adding mesh is harder if the o2
can't cool as well as previous
Silverstone enclosures there's little to
separate it from dozens of similar
tempered glass cases we didn't bother
testing any additional fan
configurations this time either since
four slots were already populated but we
did remove the front panel to test the
level of airflow obstruction or
impedance by that panel we're starting
our charts with a strict comparison
between the PMO one and PMO two the
primary oh one kept CPU temperature at
three degrees Celsius idle delta T over
a means and forty eight point six C
under the torture workload that we use
the primary Oh to idle that three point
seven delta T over a man's and averaged
fifty four point one under load the
clothes off front panel of the o2 is the
obvious culprit for the higher
temperatures but it's possible that the
top panel the oh one is more breathable
as well since the huge plastic cover
eliminates the need for a dust filter
removing the front panel of the o1 had
no effect whatsoever on CPU temperatures
were within margin of error here and
removing the O two's front panel lowered
CPU temperature to forty eight point
nine almost exactly what the stock oh
one scored this is the difference of a
front panel a five degree drop isn't the
biggest we've gotten by removing a front
panel so the o2 isn't blocking a huge
amount of air it's not doing anything
criminal but it's notable here
specifically because it indicates that
the o2 could perform every bit as well
as the o1 if it received the same mesh
treatment to reiterate this doesn't mean
that the PM o2 is bad relative to most
other cases or even in a vacuum it does
however show that there's something of a
disappointment here in that the PMO too
loses the spirit of the PMO one and it's
all to meet modern industry and trends
moving to a comparative chart we get
some perspective here fifty four point
one degrees solace is actually pretty
good compared to the rest of our charge
the level of respected cases even like
the mesh fic or the H 700 eyes hands the
smart device however those cases didn't
have the advantage of for 140 fans
running at full blast and they also
didn't have predecessors with a
particular reputation for I airflow the
PMI ones CPU temperature of 48 point six
degrees gives us more perspective it
puts it among the top performers
alongside the open-air cooler conquer
and just slightly warmer than its
smaller sibling the redline o6 it's also
near the mesh of icy kitted out with
Noctua a f-14s that's the context that
the PMO who is fighting here and in that
context it's uninteresting Silverstone's
primary series has fallen from a chart
leader to something that sits above
average that's still above average mind
you and it's still tough in the quarter
of the pack but temperatures although
doing just fine are simply unacceptable
design and the context set a high bar
for the PMO to to beat PMS use CPU
cooling is a disappointing step down
from PM a 1 however it does remain among
the better cases on the chart and if we
didn't have the context of the previous
case if this were released today as its
own new series we'd probably call it
above average and say not bad but then
again you can just buy the PMO 1 and get
something that performs a bit better
this chart shows GPU temperatures versus
the PM series cases GPU temperatures
were three point eight degrees delta-t
idle and forty eight point six under
load in the o1 we also measured four
point nine idle and fifty-four point
four under load in the o2 the
perforations in the PM o twos a front
panel thin out towards the bottom mostly
below the level of the power supply
shroud and right in front of one of the
fans this could restrict airflow towards
the bottom of the case unlike some other
cases there's no big air vent in the
bottom of the front panel since that's
where the transparent Silverstone logo
is placed to be projected onto the desk
as with CPU temperature is it taking the
front panel off of the O one had no
effect on GPU temperatures but taking
the panel off of the o2 had little
effect it's actually not that big of a
deal here there's also the LED projector
mounted in the front of the bottom fan
which provides another minor obstruction
is a comparative data the PMO one again
it performed spectacularly outperforming
most other cases other than the our l06
there's not any secret to why these two
cases perform so well again mesh and
fans those whose performance was more
average edging below average even near
the age 500 P GPU boost ena is adjusted
with heavy workloads to keep
temperatures down and we usually call
this throttle II and as a catch-all so
check the blender section coming up next
for a lower intensity benchmark and a
better look at GPU performance the
redline 0 6 and fire strike isn't even
here because we started the 3dmark
testing shortly after that case review
but at 50 point 5 degrees Celsius DB
temperature the PMO 1 is easily the
coolest of what we've tested and the PMO
two places at fifty five point six delta
T over ambient in the middle of the
chart just above Silverstone zone KL
zero seven again the zero trees
performance here would be fine if it
weren't following up one of the best
performing cases we've tested
moving on to blender rendering on the
CPU CPU delta T averaged thirty six
point seven degrees Celsius in the PMO
one and thirty nine point two and the
PMO to the one place is between the
Cougar conquer and define are six while
the o2 is again stuck in the middle of
the pack with the age five hundred P
rendering on the GPU GPU temperature
averaged twenty two point seven degrees
in the PM a1 and twenty seven in the PMO
to this test eliminates the boost
concerns for the most part of the more
stressful torture workloads proving that
there really is better GPU cooling in
the O 127 degrees Celsius is the same as
the cooler master C 700 P and between
the Alpha 550 and DBP 900 cases that we
liked for reasons other than airflow for
noise predictably the PM o one and P mo
two are respectively the noisiest and
second noisiest cases we've ever tested
by a decent margin even and that
includes the redline o six the po2 does
have more sound damping thanks to the
closed front panel but not nearly enough
to make audible differences the noise
levels are taken when running fans at
max rpm and there's no fan curve here so
you could reduce that significantly by
doing a custom fan curve but there are a
lot of fans in each case and not much
material separating them from the user
that's the trade-off though of going for
airflow the elephant in the room is the
PMO one which was and is a great case
that we've enjoyed building it in some
respects it's not fair to treat the o2
as a successor to the o1 because they're
dissimilar enough to be from completely
different product lines if they were
just named as such if it is a successor
as the name suggests the PMO too fails
to fill the PMO on shoes the O on
performs better there aren't even any
shoes to fill because you can still buy
the PMO one it's still being made and
sold and at the same price we'd prefer
the PMO one but the original plastic
window PMO one which is perfectly fine
and performs better is actually cheaper
at $120 on Amazon versus 144 the PMO -
so to kind of temper all of that a bit
I've been critical here the case
certainly to some extent does disappoint
given the context of the PMO one however
looking at the greater context of the
industry it's still a fine case
Silverstone's put something together
that has decent quality build materials
it's got a good amount of fans that
actually function well who not garbage
fans that you throw out and most of
their competitors can't even manage that
so they've still done decently but
compared to Silverstone's history just
recent history the last stuff still
being made the register sounds own
products it's almost worth just buying
one of the other ones now this doesn't
look anything like the PMO one
externally so if that look doesn't fit
you and for some reason you don't want
the red line 0-6 maybe space or
something
I guess it's fine but at that point
they're just filling a role in between
two of their existing cases so they
competing with themselves and here's the
same solar stone seems to be falling
into a pattern we've mentioned that the
red line is an excellently cold case for
the O six the red line o7 a no way are
chasing the front-panel trend this kind
of get in there but not quite and
hopefully in the future silverstone will
try to preserve some of the positive
aspects that have been received really
positively obviously i guess by the end
users and continue those in the same
product line rather than doing kind of
the opposite and join we
this product line that was really well
received let's change it completely and
try and promote it through the user
channels where people have liked it so
that they see the new one not really
sure what the strategy was there but
just Silverstone please I know who's
watching this I'm talking to you right
now we talk every year at CES I don't
know what power you guys have to to get
the naming scheme on track here but
seriously there are really good products
at Silverstone I like them a lot the red
line zero six gets my top recommendation
for a case under quite $90 maybe under a
hundred and the PMO one's a really good
case also at a really good price point
super competitive
but then the o2 and the oh seven oh
eight are nothing like the predecessors
to the point where we've now told all
these people go buy those cases they're
gonna keep an eye out for the next
version of those cases because you know
maybe someone wasn't building a system
when we reviewed the red line oh six and
they build one in a year from now they
go oh Silverstone let's see if they have
a new version of that case okay what
have they done so that's that's kind of
what I'm getting at here is you
establish you have established a really
good reputation for certain types of
cases and I know it's difficult the
industry is going RGB industries going
glass and she's going closed front
panels there's still a market that wants
what you've made you just have to reach
it
switching over to what everyone else is
doing I don't think is the right move
for a company that has so competently
shown they can still make a box that's
high quality and actually cools the
components that's not to say you
shouldn't chase the trends because I
mean someone needs to make a good one of
those boxes too so why not be
Silverstone but I would like to see it
done under different product names now
all of that said the PMO - as a case is
okay I would recommend the PMO one and
the red line zero six depending on the
class of system you're trying to build
the quality your budget things
that if for some reason let's say the
PMO want look right to you but you kind
of like how this looks look it's not
that bad it's a couple degrees warmer
the reason I'm disappointed is not
because it's a bad cooler it's because
it's not as good as the previous
Silverstone products so if you really
didn't like those and you like the look
of this one it's okay but that's kind of
it really it's just okay so that's it
for this one thank you for watching as
