great strides to showcase products that
overall look good on paper especially on
the CPU side even still as with anything
promoted on a stage at the world's most
bombastic gaming event there is a lot of
flashy marketing that deserves scrutiny
to keep perspective of reality will be
looking both qualitatively and
quantitatively at the scenario AMD used
for its stream testing showing the
differences between x264 fast medium
slow and more while also showing tuning
with process priority in FPS caps this
video will discuss why we think AMD
streaming presentation was needlessly
misleading especially since we agree
that the CPU should handle streaming
workloads more capably than the 9900 k
competitor if you're already better at
the game there's no reason to stack the
deck before that this video is brought
to you by us and the GN store the best
way to support our independent reporting
is through store gamers and access net
viewers like you allowed us to recently
switch to paying for all of our own
flights to product launch events rather
than accepting flights from companies
this is made possible with your
purchases of merch like our GN medium
mod matte in stock and shipping now and
designed with GV teardown diagrams and
grids our 100% custom-made two-tone
shirt is also a great way to help and
it's currently on sale the shirt uses
95% cotton and 5% to last in for a
sporty fit with vibrant colors and was
designed entirely by the GN team
learn more at the link of the
description below or go to store
documents access net let's be very clear
here we're not saying that Rison 3000
won't be good this is a matter of
scrutinizing a specific part of a
marketing presentation that's what it is
and we've done this for just about
everybody so it's important to do this
because our job in the industry is to be
a reality check and that's for the
companies and for viewers from people
who are buying the product and this did
deserve a bit of a reality check so what
we are saying one not that Rison 3000 is
bad or going to be bad
it actually looks promising on paper
although wait for our benchmarks and
then to we're saying that some of a.m.
these presentations were misleading and
do deserve some additional information
shed on them so today we're focusing on
the AMD streaming demonstration we
already talked about Andes
that measuring thermals with the risin
cpu's in our navy and risin announcement
video or the specs disclosure video and
that was a whole separate thing but the
streaming demonstration mostly amounted
to laughing at intel's 9900 k sayin haha
it does one FPS and that is probably for
the most part of a reproducible number
it's it's not we didn't a hundred
percent replicate it but it's close
enough that it doesn't matter because in
a stream if you're not playing at a
reasonable FPS and you're below ten it's
irrelevant it's all bad so it is for a
number that can be replicated the
benchmark in that regard is sort of
accurate it's just that it's misleading
and that's the the hard line that we
just redraw and we need to explore today
in this video so one of the things i md
said here is that with the twelve core
cpu quote you can do things that you
couldn't do before the other guy with
eight cores sorry which is sort of
throwing the and the 2700 acts under the
bus as well which is a very capable
streaming performer by the way although
a.m. these sort of disclosed some of its
testing procedure it was still
misleading for being an inaccurate
representation of the need to use the
settings that were shown in the
demonstration in a real environment so
before anyone starts slamming the
keyboard typing in the comments section
below or remind you of this many
enthusiasts felt that intel's principal
technologies benchmarks were misleading
so if those same people are arguing that
AMD wasn't misleading strictly on the
basis that it disclosed its testing
approach that's a double standard we saw
a lot of that on twitter and just wanted
to address it now principal technology
is disclosed in far greater detail how
it tested to the extent that we were
able to really burn them with it we
literally showed up at pcs doorstep to
ask about the benchmarks that I ran for
Intel versus am the at the 9000 series
launch so their results like a and these
here and the stream and demonstration
are replicable they're repeatable you
can reproduce it in your own lap but
that doesn't mean that they are
realistic or representation
representative of any real use case in
the real world it's more similar to
hiding tessellation under the world and
then demonstrating that one product runs
this workload better than the other
while neither receives a visual
benefit our quality comparisons today
will help illustrate why slow settings
don't only add zero value for gaming
content but actually have no perceptible
impact on quality when tested and
compared properly this is true for
locally recorded content and streamed
content but especially streams and
further even the core deficient
ninety-nine hundred K relative to the
twelve core CPU can be made the stream
perfectly acceptable yet still high
quality settings the Andy presentation
may have made it seem to some like the
99 hundred K can't stream in-game at the
same time but that's far from the truth
as a quick aside our thanks to e post
Vox on YouTube for helping converse with
us about stream quality concepts and for
talking through some of our ideas he
posed box runs a channel based on
improving stream quality and game
capture visuals we'll link him below he
provided some of the x264 flags that
we've played around with for stream
tuning today let's start with an
on-screen comparison showing the
different encoding modes helps to
visualize things so we'll start with
this and we'll explain more of what's
going on later well change the different
encoding modes on the screen
occasionally is that you can see the
differences between them as you're
watching try to discern the differences
if there are any between the different
encoding modes as we change them try to
guess which mode is fast which is slow
and which is medium and keep in mind
that the slower in name the in theory
higher quality at least for the things
they were designed for initially so for
example slower or placebo or slow would
be better quality in theory than medium
or fast or faster very fast but the
reason in theories in there is because
it's not always the case as you'll see
today so this was all captured on a 31
75 X there are never any dropped frames
and we can strictly look at the image
quality without the variable of
performance if you've been waiting for
the encoding mode to change while I've
been talking we actually have been
changing it well label each of them now
with slow fast and medium watch these
sequences playback for a moment and try
to keep tabs on if you see any
differences in the image quality a huge
note here some benchmark scenes changed
slightly like the clothes that
characters wear or the vehicles on the
road so it's important to pay attention
only to static objects in some games
like GTA 5 we're able to get much more
consistency and avoid those issues
together a lot of games like the
Division two and Far Cry 5 which we'll
show briefly as an example have dynamic
lighting and even the benchmark scene
this means that these particular games
are useless for comparison because a lot
of the arguments online revolves around
people thinking that they see a
difference in the shadows well if the
clouds move and the lighting is affected
it'll look different because of the game
not the encoding choice so we've
eliminated these types of changes as
best we can and just gone with games
that stay more static aside from
elements like character clothing now
that you've had some time to pick
between the three settings for the best
quality that you think you've seen it
will reveal what each is actually we
bait and switch to you all three of
these were not only the same encoding
option but were the same exact video
nothing changed we did this because
we're trying to encourage people to be
open and self-aware about having a bias
we all will so it's best to just
acknowledge it early and figure out what
it is there's no shame and a preference
just make sure it's over something that
actually has differences all three of
these were exactly the same video
overlaid and sort of fake switching
between them well drop the tricks now
and actually show you the difference is
we're going to use one two and three
labeling for a moment so that we don't
influence your opinions with the actual
titles of which setting is used these
scenes are actually switching this time
between three different captures with
three different encoding presets and we
want you to try and perceive a
difference again the one two three
labeling is a check against bias and
we'll reveal them in a moment
all three are used with a 10 megabit per
second encoding option just like AMD did
we've actually used this in the past too
and they're locally captured but we also
did separate streaming tests local
capture was necessary for this
comparison for one funny reason with the
streaming tests although it worked for
comparing them internally it's a
terrible idea for this video because
then we would have to download and
reload the stream and then you just
compound the compression so it's a
terrible idea for this video because
you'd be looking at results has happened
compressed and rendered several times
instead of just the ones that it needs
to go up the first time aside from OBS
obviously in the initial capture so by
taking this route we're actually giving
the AMD the benefit of the doubt much
like they claimed to do for Intel
although that's
different story and we're doing that by
uploading the highest quality possible--
within the settings used remember once
uploaded you hit upload our compression
by the website that further mitigates
the differences between those quality
choices that's a big part of the story
here let's now review the basics while
you watch these comparisons a little bit
more keep in mind that smoke or fog
effect changes our in-game dynamism and
that they may have some procedural
elements in the games as well that are
not affected by encoding quality x264 is
an encoding option available in OBS
another capture software and in
rendering software and is used in
conjunction with the CPU to live encode
video capture for stream viewers or for
upload later in OBS you have the option
of x264 CPU encoding or GPU encoding
whether that's on Nvidia or AMD like NV
encoder the x264 library has dozens of
options that can be tweaked but most
users will choose between ultra fast
super fast very fast faster fastest low
and slower that's all the presets really
but you typically do that instead of
hand-tuned your own options which is
possible you could actually do that the
slower the encoding option selected the
more resources it requires in theory
image quality increases but there is
also a placebo level of quality at some
point and there's also a right place to
use each of the settings like slow and
slower and it's not typically game
streaming or capture if ever really but
the bit rate at which games are streamed
and captured is also lower than high
quality media like you might get from a
movie or something
most streamers use very fast or faster
if streaming on the host system might be
the system playing the game and
streaming at the same time with a bit
rate likely of 6 megabits per second max
twitch does not permit a stream greater
than 6 megabits per second but YouTube
does so we actually don't have too much
of an issue with Andy's use of 10
megabits per second bitrate we actually
use that bitrate for our own testing
because we use that bitrate for our own
streams to YouTube and so we aren't too
concerned with that aspect but if you
care only about twitch streaming just
keep in mind that you're more interested
in 6 not in 10 and for our benchmarks
and you'll see them when the CPUs come
out we do actually benchmark both 6 and
10 so you have a representation of each
now determine if you think there was a
difference between
one two and three and make a note of
which you thought looks best when I
reveal them if you thought fast or
medium looked best that means you're in
potentially placebo territory and
there's probably no actual meaningful
difference between the captures you were
just trying to find one which is okay we
did that too when we first went through
these tests and tried to discern the
differences so let's reveal what those
clips were now we'll explain some more
while they play back with the proper
name revealed you'll see these frames
repeated from earlier and we might add a
few additional quality settings and here
for you very fast we'll start showing up
and showing some compression differences
where the others don't necessarily but
we maintain that slow medium and fast
all look functionally equivalent to
locally and that should be doubly true
once uploaded there may be some small
pixel pixel differences but there won't
be quality differences like better or
worse it's just how YouTube at this
point is processing it and if it is a
problem we'll upload it somewhere else
uncompressed although that is part of
the the point here too is that YouTube
does compress but anyway as for what
each mode does while that runs through
some more here's a breakdown slow versus
fast which is usable on the 9900 KB by
the way I will prove that later keeps
adaptive quantization - mode 1 for both
settings enabling adaptive quantization
the ability to redistribute bits within
a frame going up to mode 2 would
redistribute bits across the entire
video which isn't useful here and go
into a cue mode 3 will net more
distribution to dark parts of the scenes
but that option is not enabled in any of
the presets and we're on one for both of
these to being compared slow changes be
adapt to mode 2 from mode 1 with fast
and very fast which changes to a slower
and newer algorithm that suffers a speed
reduction with a higher B frame setting
or bi-directional frame but how our
chart shows that B frames in both fast
and slow are the same and B frames will
provide a pixel Delta that contains only
the information from changed pixel
values frame the frame but not the
absolute value for every pixel in the
frame these act as an intermediary step
in the temporal process for example the
change from frame 0 to frame two the
newer algorithm will
slower but does not improve the quality
output in a gaming stream it takes more
resources to run without any added value
remember a lot of these settings are for
video transcodes and encode and as Ipoh
Spock says again linked below more for
pixel junkies and enthusiasts than they
are for game streaming where the value
is anywhere from low in the value add to
non-existent here's a chart on the
screen again to help illustrate these
sourced originally from archived site
bean dog d-block remains at the same
between slow and fast
this setting impacts encoding quality
and time more heavily than some of the
others but only changes with the ultra
fast preset slow changes direct from
spatial with fast to auto which means
that slow will choose between spatial
and temporal particularly in a multi
pass and code where each option can be
attempted and then the better choice
can be kept it's sort of averages along
the way in that second pass you get some
additional data much of the usefulness
is lost in a single pass game capture
environment particularly one where we're
working with relatively low quality to
begin with more notably slow changes
Emme from hex to umh from the ME GUI
wikibooks entry this change is quote
considerably slower than hex what
searches a complex multi hexagon pattern
in order to avoid harder to find motion
factors
unlike hex and dia the ME range
parameter directly controls at um HS
search radius allowing one to increase
or decrease the size of the wide search
this should theoretically help with
motion ending the quotes there but as
you'll see in our demos there really
isn't any tangible difference with a
game stream slow also changes look ahead
to 50 measured in units of frames up
from 30 with fast
this means that 50 frames will be used
for rate control and with regard to
mbtree should theoretically increase
video quality at the cost of speed but
again a lot of this will depend on what
kind of video you're encoding and for
what Pervis h.264 after all wasn't
invented for this purpose solely it
wasn't made for game streaming it does a
lot of other stuff and we use it to
encode all of our videos too there are a
few other changes and you'll see them in
the chart but what else
matters is the quality comparison in
this use case it comes down to a
qualitative look performance is the
other angle of this getting into
performance we'll be looking at stream
benchmarks using the division - just
like AMD but we're going to run at 1080p
locally in streams this is because the
1440p local setting that AMD used
created a GPU constraint on the host
system they did stream at 1080 though
and this artificially limited the player
side performance to bring the Intel CPU
even with AMD CPU it also creates enough
GPU load with Andy running at nearly
100% GP load during its stream evidenced
by the in-game UI on the right side of
the screen it's enough GPU load that OBS
will miss some of the frame renders we
believe this removes Headroom for OBS is
a scene compositing and when checking
with a post box it sounds like he
believes the same this introduces
variables that AMD should have accounted
for in fair testing but instead create
it
we'd be curious to see what the render
lag metric was for Andy's test runs
along with the percent delivered within
2% of 16.6 67 milliseconds as these were
some of the only metrics not published
starting with viewer performance this is
the output that the viewer will see when
watching the stream except represented
as percentages this testing was done
with real live streaming over a fiber
network we tried a lot of settings
especially now that we know how similar
fast medium and slow and often very slow
will look to each other and we found
that the 9,900 k stock cpu without any
overclocking at all with turbo duration
limits enabled and running at in tiles
at 95 watt TDP it's capable of game
streaming with 10 megabits per second
fast settings with the division - at
Ultra settings again that's with turbo
boost duration limits enabled so we're
running this thing properly stocked
more so than almost any motherboard will
do for you out of the box by disabling
the non stock mother would power
override options with fast settings and
no tuning the 99 hundred K delivered 100
percent of its frames to stream
meaning that the viewer did receive a 60
FPS stream while the player maintained a
119 FPS average gaming framerate with a
low as bottoming out just at 50 fps
this is reasonable when considering the
local streaming going on in the
background
the host system always hits a 0.1% low
as hard even with the high-end HED t18
core CPUs and can be improved it
primarily if not only by using a
secondary system this is what seriously
competitive streamers should be doing to
avoid frame time drops if they are
actually competitive in the games
they're playing and they need that frame
time consistency the only downside of
the fast stream is that it's frame
delivery pacing sits at 51% within plus
or minus 2% of sixteen point six sixty
seven millisecond delivery we're still
within a few percent of sixteen point
six six seven milliseconds overall
enough that we hit the 60fps deliverable
target but the frame pacing is imperfect
and could be improved this is actually
more results of the frame lag caused by
the higher GPU load than by the CPU load
created but we can make some changes on
both sides of things to try and address
this this is also something that AMD
likely would have counted at its e3
presentation but did not talk about or
discuss on stage we demonstrated this by
carefully reducing the GPU load with
in-game options but by keeping the CPU
load exactly what was previously plus or
minus about 1% error with these changes
frame pacing improves to 93.3% within
plus or minus 2% of sixteen point six
sixty seven millisecond delivery and
further demonstrates that AMD's test was
flawed there was too much GPU load in
the scenario creating external variables
in frame lag because OBS is also running
behind on the GPU resources it needs
this is why we spend so much time
explaining our streaming tasks when we
do them and often dedicate in 10 to 15
minutes just doing stream tests there
are a lot of variables and it requires a
lot of care to do properly when I say
dedicating 10 to 15 minutes I mean in
one video where the whole video length
might be 25 minutes anyway going back to
the ultra settings by using real time
process priority for OBS we can see that
we improved the frame pacing to the
viewer from the original 51 percent to
71 percent but the reduction in our
other chart was to 0.1 percent lows for
the player this too can be tuned out by
keeping process priority targeted at OBS
and setting an 80 FPS in-game cap we're
now freeing up CPU resources from the
game which is spewing potentially
unnecessary frames for the player and
locating them instead to the much more
important OBS we now have a 97% delivery
within plus or minus 2% of 16
milliseconds this results in a high
quality stream for both the player and
the viewer and can be tuned further with
other settings of desired medium
encoding delivers 59% of the frames to
the stream so is where the ninety-nine
hundred K starts to struggle with this
title ultimately we found that medium
encoding does work just fine for the
ninety-nine hundred K in some games but
it depends on how intensive the game is
on the CPU in this instance the
ninety-nine hundred K has trouble out of
the box without any changes it can do
fast and with some small changes it can
start to do fast with a near-perfect
delivery in terms of frame pacing but
it's already pretty good it's good
enough that most viewers won't really
complain and if you're a professional
streamer you'd either want some heavy
tuning on there like some of the stuff
we've done in here plus additional x264
tuning or you just get a separate system
and really do it the proper way
slow is too abusive on the 1900 K for it
to handle on its own so I'm tuning with
priority and FPS caffeine boosts it's a
30% frames delivered but that's
obviously an entirely pointless stream
with very low viewer quality and you
will almost certainly win in this
comparison but it's a pointless and
misleading victory ultimately just like
running a game with tessellation under
the map Crysis 2 will make AMD look
worse than Nvidia the actual visual
quality is not improved even though the
FPS looks different whenever we've used
slow in demonstrations in the past we've
been extremely careful to outline why
it's not a useful comparison beyond a
purely synthetic workload our issue with
AMD's presentation is that it wasn't
presented this way but instead mislead
viewers to believe the quality would be
meaningfully superior at the end of the
day the comparison should have been
something else because realistically the
900k can stream every bit as well as any
of you will ever need for a single
stream slower isn't actually better here
anyone getting more serious should be
using the secondary system anyway
because the frame times will always be
more consistent without background
processes something we've extensively
shown in the past a better demonstration
would have been Andy demoing it's a
likely capability of managing two
simultaneous live streams both twitch
and YouTube for me will have multiple
audiences something that the 99
would struggle with without using any
rebroadcast or service another great
example that we would have loved to see
AMD use would be doing a local recording
with x264 and also doing a live stream
this is useful if you're a streamer who
wants to upload to twitch live and then
maybe upload bits and pieces of your
performance to YouTube later without
having to read download the vaad through
twitch so you retain a lot of that
quality this is a valid comparison and
one where the 12 Corizon cpu would
probably win we don't know for sure
because we don't have it but almost
certainly be better than nine 900k added
well certainly it would be actually and
it probably would be good enough to do
both of these things with very fast or
maybe fast or faster settings not slow
but something that's actually useful a
dual stream test has some real use cases
and would still have had AMD in the lead
but in a more useful realistic metric
we're not trying to say and II won't be
better at this little comparison it's
just that the comparison is useless and
misleading because it provides no value
and a massive performance hit if
anything we're trying to help and the
marketing better represent its own
product finally looking at the chart for
player side FPS we're hitting 147 FPS
average with baseline performance this
metric highlights the CPU without any
streaming constraints functionally an
unhindered gaming the frame rate and is
useful for illustrating the impact to
frame rate and time that streaming has
going down to a 10 megabit per second
and fast from baseline we maintain 80%
of the original speed while also
maintaining a 60 FPS livestream Albi it
with mixed frame pace and results
instituting a frame cap obviously caps
the frame rate 280 FPS but does allow
0.1% lows to climb back to 50 FPS while
improving frame pacing to near
perfection on the stream side you can
also see that these slow settings aside
from the frame capped one maintain a
high frame rate this begins to show a
resource allocation issue compounded
with an overall lack of sufficient
resources on the Intel CPU for these
unmodified presets and for the stock
clock hardware that frame time hit by
adding a stream always brings us down to
50 FPS for 0.1% lows in the best case in
this game and we're looking at the
better performing options you'll see
that's true across both of them in
previous testing we have Illustrated
that this happens on both Intel and AMD
sometimes with much worse
percent lows and it's a nature of live
encoding from the system that's also
hosting the game so that's it that's
really all this was it was okay they're
testing this with slow settings let's
explore this and a couple of things here
we are happy to take credit for being
the ones to popularize this type of test
so we started doing this around the 7900
acts launch and our first set of testing
or one of them was to do dual streams
where you broadcast the two services at
the same time without a rebroadcast
service in between to eat quality or
introduce latency and that's a valid use
case sort of but it's rare one another
use case we've tested in the past was
local recording and streaming and that's
where we think Andy should have focused
its attention because it's a very valid
use case for streamers who are serious
about pulling some of their content
uploading it to YouTube and bits and
pieces before someone else captures it
off of twitch and reuploads it under a
different name so another valid use case
AMD former one of the former marketing
team members told us in person that he
had borrowed some of this testing
methodology for their own marketing
presentations which is fine but it being
that they did borrow this in part from
us originally whether or not the onstage
presentation did this at e3 we obviously
caught we knew the deal like we've done
these tests we know what we were looking
for and knew it was reasonable and what
wasn't so anyway the biggest problem we
have with the test is that it has
already propagated a mentality that this
quality preset in OBS is somehow
advantageous in any meaningful way
that's the key word meaningful way we
can't see it if there is one so there
are places where these other quality
settings with x264 or h.264 if you
prefer are useful and as he posed Fox
said pixel junkies maybe if you're
converting files or transcoding videos
that are higher quality dealing with
with greater level of detail than
something like a game would especially
stream that 6 or 10 megabits per second
that's where you might start seeing some
advantages but for these purposes it is
not a tangible advantage
and that's the problem is a lot of the
discussion around this from people
who've never done any streaming before
or don't really know anything about it I
haven't done any testing of streaming
before have no idea how its tested those
are the people who are out in forums on
reddit wherever and defending a
presentation with really there's no
reason to like Andy and their CPU
they'll do just fine in game streaming
they'll almost certainly be ahead in a
reasonable use case for this application
as well it's just the matter of how
threads work with streaming content so
this is something that Andy would have
won regardless it just we would have
liked to have seen it with a real use
case not something that is synthetic to
the point that again it's putting
tessellation under the map in Crysis 2
and then showing that Nvidia tested
better that's the same kind of thing
that's happening here so anyway a lot of
people thought that SLO would actually
improve the stream quality and started
parroting the presentation so we wanted
to put this video together and beyond
that there's this this sort of
fascinating double standard with AMD
where when intolerant Vidya get
criticized by the media and we've done a
lot of that for misleading marketing
practices there's a sort of peanut
gallery that cheers it on and then when
AMD gets criticized there's a big jump
to the defense of AMD but Andy's not a
person being picked on they're not a kid
in the playground and he's a big company
too and Andy needs to needs to be
challenged for its marketing as well
especially as it gets bigger it gets for
a confident that's going to become
increasingly important so you don't need
to find any reason to defend AMD is what
we're saying and at the end of the day
we do this to everybody just as a
reminder because some people didn't do
the usual Joel comments about this as a
reminder we published a video at
Computex last year titled Intel's 28
cores of bullshit and then we also went
to PT principal technologies visited
them we had a scene were kind of counted
on counted from three down and flipped
off the camera because of the testing
methodology with Nvidia we put them in
our disappointment bill
and on a shirt that we sold a lot of for
the disappointment build so if this
happens to everybody from us it's not
meant to be personal for those of you
who are big game the fans please take a
step back look at the quality
comparisons we did and try to remove
that bias and just think about well okay
so this wasn't really a valid comparison
but there are a lot of valid comparisons
and let's just focus on those because
again if you're already good at the game
there's no reason to stack the deck and
this is a matter of AMD has a lot of
things that its processors are genuinely
really good at so we'd like to see those
focused on not creating these synthetic
scenarios that will actually benefit
nobody in the game streaming space which
is where it was targeted so that's it
