processor for streaming but there have
been few data-driven tests to look at if
this is actually true
today's benchmark will be a truly
multi-threaded multitasking workload or
bogging down the 70 to 100 K and r7 1700
with gaming OBS game streaming and
stream playback all on the same system
at the same time we've been saying that
Rison should theoretically be better at
game streaming dollar-for-dollar since
its launch but that was based largely on
educated assessment of the production
performance today we're here to look at
whether the 1700 is better than the 7700
K at streaming not just better but
better in a meaningful paradigm-shifting
way before that this is brought to you
by EVGA S at CLC 280 liquid cooler for
CPUs which we previously benchmarked and
found to be a high performer given its
relative silence the temperature output
learn more about this $140 cooler at the
link in the description below there are
a lot of things that make stream
benchmarking difficult and a lot of ways
to optimize the performance for one CPU
or another for example you could tune
the h.264 profile you go through xsplit
OBS and change all manner of settings in
there including the bitrate which
certainly helps out and helps with
uplink that's problem or you can start
getting into windows side things like
tuning the affinity or process priority
for OBS or for xsplit that makes it
challenging that's why it takes a while
to get through this so everything here
in this video just to get this out of
the way now is based on our testing
we're not going to make sweeping
statements about either of these tube
CPUs for all games streaming because
frankly will vary based on the game
based on if you use xsplit OBS based on
your h.264 profile and tuning based on
how much after you're willing to put
into things like process priority
optimization we've got a few of those
tests here but it's just not reasonable
to do all of them so everything here is
based on our tests if you get better or
worse performance in one way or another
then try to use the settings we used and
maybe you'll improve your performance or
worsen it depending on what you're using
so that's part one now the testing here
looks at a few different things we are
effectively doing a multitasking test
finally but it's by using some very
heavy workload so we have the game
running we're using dirt rally right now
for a baseline and then dota 2 as well
just because it's a pretty common stream
of old game well you can add other gains
for the future but those to set a good
baseline and then we also are using OBS
or open broadcasting the open source
program that you can use for free using
that we have settings tunes that are all
detailed in the article below and the
stream testing methodology but the very
quick part of it is based on viewer
feedback from you all
we took some polls not long ago and
found that the most common settings for
h.264 tuning were fast and very fast and
so we chose the one in the middle
faster and then there's a couple of
others as well like ultra fast but we
chose the one right in between what most
of you use when you are streaming and
then the next question we asked was
what's the bitrate that you use and the
answer was basically six to ten megabits
per second so we tested six and ten
megabits per second for main bit rates
our uplink depending on the day it was
tested limits us to anywhere from 20 to
40 megabits per second up but 6 to 10 is
always within that range that's a
non-issue and then finally we had some
questions about twitch versus YouTube
popularity it seems like originally
YouTube was more popular twitch edged it
out at the end twitch we had some issues
with on the account side on the partner
side of things so we ended up using
YouTube which is fine because ultimately
it allowed us to do more tuning anyway
just because YouTube with our accounts
anyway allows for better bit rates
allows for better resolutions things
like that so we did do some twitch
testing at 720p60 we ended up scrapping
it for some better testing with YouTube
so that's the main information during
this test and we collected power
consumption which is a bit unique did
that with a current clamp at the EPS
12-volt cables going to the motherboard
straight from power supply so that is
not through software and then we also
measured thermals which we won't really
be going into today in the video there
will be some notes on it in the article
and then we're focusing on a viewer
experience and streamer experience
viewer experience is what someone like
you would see when you're watching a
game streamer and the fluidity of the
stream coming
out to you and then player experience or
streamer experience is what they're seen
when they're playing the game which is
not necessarily what you see they may be
there may be some disparity in the
framerate there
so interesting stuff to look at that
goes through most of it though this will
wrap up our storyline for a lot of the
1770 700k testing you're previously
tested VR and found no significant
difference between the two of them for
the most part now we're looking to see
if the same is true for streaming
we'll start with dirt rally then move to
dota 2 on the screen now is a
side-by-side output comparison of these
7,700 cavers of the r7 1,700 we have not
labeled either right now both are in
stock configuration this video playback
is the resulting stream that went to
youtube so this is what the viewer would
experience but not necessarily the
player this playback is at 1080p 60
natively with a 10 megabit per second
operate now that you've had time to
develop some thoughts on the outputs
let's reveal which CPU corresponds to
which playback this gives you an idea
for viewer experience but let's put
numbers to it we'll look at the players
experience after we go through some of
the OBS benchmarks getting to stream
performance numbers starting with 1080p
60 at 10 megabits per second going to
YouTube using dirt rally first we
monitored the on-screen performance
during the stream the 77 100k CPU stock
dropped 40 4.3 percent of its frames
during encoding due to inability to meet
the sixteen point six seven millisecond
deadline you want that number to be as
close to zero as possible dropped frames
it means that they are completely
skipped they never make it to the viewer
and so it's a stuttering experience if
you're not performing at sixty or thirty
or whatever you've configured it to the
r7 1,700 CPU dropped 0.1% of its frame
amounting to double digit numbers versus
thousands of total frames and on for a
second though because we do some process
priority optimization in a moment that
has interesting results and helps Intel
out a bit within plus or minus 2% of the
sixteen point six seven millisecond the
delivery window for frames or 60fps if
you prefer the 7700 K delivers 63
percent of its frames at around the 60
FPS delivery cadence while the r7 1700
manages to deliver 85 point five percent
of its frames during the 60fps cadence
we want this number to be as high as
possible
and we also want the next two numbers
frames above and below 16.7 milliseconds
to be as low as possible and keep in
mind that this is only looking at the
frames that actually get encoded to be
delivered so this does not count the
dropped frames for example which were
never they just never made it this far
even though frames faster than 16.7
milliseconds will be well faster it
doesn't mean that the experience will be
better we want consistency at 60fps not
frames delivered at varying intervals
which leads to choppiness appending that
eight milliseconds followed by a frame
at 20 or 24 is going to look choppy
end of story the 7700 K delivers about
16% of its frames faster than sixteen
point seven milliseconds would be 1700
delivering six point six percent of its
frames faster than this window as well
we're at twenty point six versus eight
percent for the frame times above
sixteen point seven knows I can but
ideally were just as close to sixteen
point seven as possible as shown on the
overclocking figures the 7700 K Clause
back some ground and drop frames by
going to four point nine gigahertz but
not enough to really even out the battle
drop into six megabits per second stream
and will lighten the load on the CPU so
we're doing that next at six megabits
per second with 7700 K jobs twenty six
point four percent of its frames rather
than in the 40s before and it is now
markedly improved that the six megabits
per second bit rate rather than ten the
r7 1700 is now dropping zero percent of
its frames with frames in our sixteen
point seven millisecond window improves
a bit as well bringing the 70 to 100 K
to 64 point four percent and AMD is
delivering about the same as the 10
megabit per second test still on the
lead though its lead in drop frames is
significant and the most notable the
7700 K is delivering more frames to the
player as we'll show in a moment in most
instances but that doesn't mean the
experience is good for the viewer as
we've just clearly seen we can improve
it though and we did so it's priority
optimisation for OBS on the 77 hard K
but this doesn't fix everything by
changing process priority to high on the
7700 K s stock we drop down to
effectively 0% dropped frames that is an
insane change from what we were just
looking at a moment ago this results in
all rendered frames being delivered to
the stream but fewer frames are rendered
total so it's a trade
chenna hard k is now masked with the r7
1700 technically for streaming
performance insofar as ability to
deliver rendered frames to the stream
viewer and it seemed that the fix was
easy
except there's still FPS on the other
side of the argument remember just
because we deliver 100% of the frame so
the streaming service doesn't mean that
the frame rate is high or that the frame
latency is low all it means is that
we've delivered all the frames however
many that may be listen provement occurs
because we've taken resources from
rendering the game and have given them
to rendering it with OBS for encoding on
the streaming side so we're not adding
resources anywhere that's not possible
what we are doing is reassigning them
this means that there must be lost
elsewhere in the system or the
experience it's just a matter of how
relevant or visible that loss is looking
at FPS to find out how relevant the
losses are our baseline FPS performance
shows how each of the CPUs performs
without any active streaming or
streaming playback the stock 7700 K
manages 114 FPS average 90 FPS 1% lows
and 82 fps 0% lows for fluid performance
across the board overclocking doesn't
get us much more in this case the stock
1700 operates a 108 FPS average for this
particular workload with lows at 88 and
76 remember this isn't a number we
actually care about today we're not
comparing these two numbers is just for
perspective when we're comparing
performance loss on the client side when
streaming during the 10 megabit per
second stream the 7700 K drops to 104
FPS average width was at 77 1 % and 30s
your 100 cent we've traditionally seen a
big hit to the 0.1% fame time metrics
resultant of streaming so this follows
that trend the performance loss from
baseline is 9% Intel to Intel with
streaming vs. not and the client side
streaming performance is consistent for
the player with no seriously jarring the
hitches despite what the viewers are
seen in the stock configuration and the
experience is a 16 percent performance
loss from baseline to 10 megabits per
second streaming but again is able to
sustain a better stream output for the
viewer as for the 77 100k with high
process priority on OBS we drop down to
64 FPS average with 1% low frame time is
computing the 17 and 0.1% 210 1 0 the
experience is a stuttery mess and dismal
all around despite
all friends technically being encoded
and alerted by OBS this was where that
number is misleading there just aren't
that many frames to work with so the job
isn't that hard and delivering 100% of
frames really isn't a big deal when you
have ten for your low-end frame rate six
megabit per second numbers will be in
the article if those interest you
they're largely the same those spoiler
performance on the streamer side is
relatively good on both processors
overall let's now look at power
consumption during the 10 megabit per
second dirt stream we're measuring power
consumption by clamping the 12-volt
wires going to the EPS 12 volt CPU
cables and then multiplying the current
clamp rating by twelve point three volts
which is the output of our power supply
down those cables the 70 to 100 K plots
first with a very stable and consistent
66 watt draw from the EPS 12-volt cables
and when we overclock to 7700 K which
did improve streaming performance output
somewhat significantly in cases if not
enough to compete anyway the overclocked
version results in about 89 watts drawn
at the PSU cables and plotting the r7
1,700 power consumption last we see
power consumption that averages out to
about 64 to 69 watts with peak
consumption at sixty eight point nine
that's having 700 K and 1700 to our
drawing effectively equal amounts of
power in these tests though the 1700
response seems more varied next game
here now looking at dota 2 and I
side-by-side comparison between the 7700
K and 1700 which we've left unnamed once
again dota 2 doesn't run into any
limitations other than the CPU for this
test given its lightweight GPU workload
this was conducted while playing back a
match with team complexity during the
2017 invitational
so each test is identical to the
previous and is easily replicable we
start this test around the 15 minute
mark of the playback let's reveal which
CPU is which the unveil is probably
somewhat expected after the results from
dirt but on to the numbers next start
with streaming the output performance at
10 megabits per second we observe about
fifty nine point nine percent of dropped
frames on the 7700 K with the
overclocked version dropping 54 percent
of its frames for a slight improvement
of the frames that the 7700 K does
successfully deliver without dropping 85
percent are dispatched within the two
percent window of sixteen point seven
milliseconds and the r7 1700 manages to
deliver 95% of its
encoded frames within 2% of its 16.7
millisecond window remember this metric
isn't counting drop frames since those
frames are never made any way they're
never encoded so the number it looks a
bit better than perhaps it is in reality
to the viewer dropping the 6 megabits
per second improves performance across
the board as expected on this next chart
for Intel anyway and these performance
really couldn't get much better than it
was already the 70 100k now drops just
47% of its frame stock 38% overclocked
with 94% of the total delivered frames
at landing within 2% of the 16.7
millisecond window that's good for
consistency but the actual delivery
isn't really that great and can't really
make use of it and these are 7 1,700
didn't drop any frames in this test and
delivered 98% within these 16.7
millisecond window looking good giving
the OBS a processed priority of high
however and ranking it above dota for
the performance priority in Windows we
began resolved the issue of dropping
frames and are now delivering all frames
to the streaming service theoretically
this smooth things out but not of FPS
tanks let's take a look at that next
we're going to have the FPS testing with
dota 2 we found our baseline performance
to be about 171 FPS average of the 7700
K what was that 89 and 47 0.1% dota has
some issues here as it always has these
17 100's baseline performance is 167
average again and this is important the
point here isn't to compare the two
against each other right now it's
establishing a baseline for comparison
against the same product while streaming
while streaming at 10 megabits per
second the 7700 K manages a 118 FPS
average for a 31% reduction in baseline
average FPS performance or not streaming
the r7 1700 manages 73 FPS average for a
56% reduction from its base line the
7700 K delivers a higher frame rate and
overall better experience to the
client-side streamer in this instance
while the r7 1700 delivers a better
experience for the viewer different
sides of the same coin the difference is
that the 1700 manages a still adequate
frame rate for both the streamer
despite being lower overall while also
offering a significantly better frame
rate for the viewers this is the
balancing act and an hour
tests and he appears to be doing that
better our test with process priority on
OBS yields an average FPS of 92 still
better than a.m. these are 717 100
streaming average fps and our lows are
at 34 and 21 overall results are worse
than these stocks 7700 K tests with
normal process priorities but better
than these results it's a hell of a
fight for Intel to get this far but in
this lighter weight game that's more
frequency intensive the 7700 K manages
to pull it off
I gracefully mind you and you have to do
some tuning but it's possible moving on
to power consumption at 1080p 60 with a
10 megabit per second up rates the 7700
case sustains a flat consistent power
consumption of 60 3.96 watts at the EPS
trouble rails with a plus or minus 2%
error from our device identical to last
time really or close to it 1700 is
bouncing around near 62 63 watts of
power consumption with minimum at 52 and
maximum at 65 B 17 100 averages a couple
watts of lower power draw overall versus
the studies of 100 K there's no major
difference between them this is where
all those caveats come into play that we
mentioned earlier if you wanted to
stream on the 7700 K you could there are
just a lot of things you have to do to
make it happen and it's really going to
depend on the games you're playing for
one you could change the quality where
we did faster h.264 you could drop to
something like very fast or ultra fast
which will increase your encoding speed
at the cost of the output quality to the
viewer on the stream there is some level
placebo effects once you get down into
the slower settings mind you so there's
room to do this tuning if you wanted to
you could also set process priority for
OBS which clearly picked up the
streaming performance but did hurt our
gaming performance so depending on what
game it is you may or may not have room
there to do that if you're already
struggling to run the game without
process priority given through OBS
you're going to struggle even worse when
it OBS is given priority and ultimately
if the game just can't sustain a good
framerate to begin with it's not going
to look good on the stream either even
if it delivers a hundred percent of the
frames if you're delivering 20 frames a
second it's still going to be 20 frames
a second despite how efficient or
consistent that delivery is a next item
of note
is that you can keep in mind the more
intensive games will have more
difficulty coping with the process the
prioritization when given to obs
as resources get assigned to OBS rather
than the game we're not creating more
resources we're just moving them around
and you have a finite amount of
resources on the CPU side to give to the
game and the streaming service and in
this case all to the playback service
which is the lightest workload of all
finally you could lower the bitrate
where we did ten and six you can go down
to something like 3,500 kilobits per
second or 4,000 basically four megabits
per second below that would certainly
help out but again you're doing so at
the cost of quality for the output
product just depends on how important it
is to you to have a higher quality
stream if you're doing this
professionally it's probably still worth
looking into a dedicated streaming box
that'll make your life a lot easier
going forward but it is potentially a
more expensive solution if not more
expensive depending on the market of RAM
and all that stuff right now in the very
least it is more space consuming so
different options for different folks
but right now as it stands in our test
today they're rallying dota 2 being the
only two examples we have currently
Intel is getting crushed in dirt rally
it's kind of doing okay and dota if you
do all the tuning but again you're
entering into arguments where yes it can
compete but you have to work for it you
have to lower your quality potentially
and AMD is doing it a bit easier out of
the box which is kind of an interesting
flip considering and the out of the box
when Rison shift and up until really
just recently had a whole lot of issues
it was a like we said about Vega it was
a project car you bought it because you
were okay with the idea of playing on
settings you're okay with the idea of
BIOS updates of Windows updates of
tuning things and trying to get things
to work of finding stability for memory
timings those things we're hopefully
okay to you as a project but now looking
at streaming Intel is the one that
requires the tuning Intel has become the
project car so depending on what you're
doing there are different options for
different people and right now we have
to go with and the Rison 7 CPUs
dollar-for-dollar vs. Intel
so the 7700 K versus the 1700 for
streaming that probably extends down to
the r5 line as well we haven't tested it
yet but one could reasonably assume that
an r5 CPU versus an i5 CPU is probably
going to crush an i-5 potentially more
so than we've seen here but we haven't
tested it yet
it's just that looking at the numbers we
have core counts we have thread counts
we have the processor speeds it's pretty
clear how it would perform and the i-5
is don't hold on as well as the i7s do
because they've got a frequency deficit
and a major thread deficit to the i7s
and of course the r5 is by extension so
if you're streaming and you don't want
to use NV encoder and you don't want to
use a capture machine look at Rison for
the easier to work with option if you
are using one of those things doesn't
matter so much pick whatever is going to
play your game at the frame that you
want and then hook it into NV encoder at
the risk of the other new issues you
have to run into with that side of
things or hook it into a capture box and
really resolve
pretty much everything quality wise but
introduce a whole bunch of new headaches
for you in terms of money spent space
consumed and learning how to use the
tools there's no perfect solution here
but AMD is doing well to compete in a
market where previously Intel had no
competition to the point that Intel CPUs
kind of looked ok but today it's
different so thank you for watching as
well you can go to patreon.com/scishow
and access to help support this type of
testing it does take quite a bit of time
to figure out we have a lot more we want
to do with streaming i'm curious to hear
what you use for your settings when you
stream we've already asked this question
a few times now it doesn't hurt to tell
us below what settings you use what
quality you try to target when
outputting maybe we'll consider it for
inclusion in our next round of test
games of course are also interesting to
us if there's a particular game you want
to test it maybe overwatch let us know
