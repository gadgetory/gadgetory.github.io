in the news manager over there today if
you are a nearby place or your future of
this year we've got a really great panel
lineup and best way to get started is
starving introduce ourselves a lot of
say a little bit what you worked on Red
Storm and I work partly including last
few Splinter Cell Games comment
my name is Rebecca 19 some campaigns
I've worked bridgeman pass various
compromising games Ghost Recon in 806
and just very excited here today I
choose to Graham and he doubles internet
games work doc Gear franchise which in
the franchise government for a while
army
a 1-up window oil eggs honor epic games
and work down here for three levels for
that and before that I was working on
these different forever
so the reason for kind of payments panel
together is the future of the shooter
and I don't think we would really need
to ask that question if it wasn't for
kind of the state of the genre right now
we're see necessarily made but you can't
argue that there are tons of shooters
out there so first obvious question is
how do you do set apart in the siege of
shears I think both ways response he
hates it says that part in the seller is
by potential around felonies and ask the
players here in society we're starting
to see much more attention page and
narrative storytelling
and those elements became more in the
past they got church rift or shunted off
to do readings or walls of text now
they're being more fully integrated and
doing this service or atonement
also art styles Andrea quinta and
differentiate yourself in the crowd like
notice on my team fortress 2 and lotus
like goodly all the time right so
experimenting with you know varying
degrees of realism heavy side lies is
another way to say part fanatics and
also the potentially tackling challenges
social issues I know Glasgow Street on
time feature a lot of civilians in the
particles and non-combatants here to
actually try not to shoot but the future
I think players will get a chance to get
a chance to put out other things like
child right yeah the shoppers doing all
week long to city employees of shooters
the art
its first person with a gun so it's kind
of hard
we talk a lot of games as a service not
just eight years and years of shootout
game in box when it's wonderful an
interactive experience to play
difference
three that will do that really house
just have have a shoes can alice is to
really i guess i would say freedom of
plays i think a lot of people talk about
my free to play but for me it's more
freedom to play and how i would express
that is if you have shooter be pushing
people all the time is people guns and
freedom of play be as a lot of people to
play ways besides just being the Slayer
the person is really good at killing and
for me one thing i do really have a game
to stand out as a shooter is what if
there's someone that was able to not
just shoot people but also to make the
weapons people are shooting with right
what if there's a guy i was a gunsmith
and he has materials that collects in
the game
another like crafting tap games what if
this year at whole this guy's whole roll
he just made guns and then it was on the
market maybe it was sold to two other
players and the developer takes account
or maybe there's a game economy that's
all tripping and with that shooter alone
is that someone that could be doing
something that's not just a FG people
rocket motors all of us so that's that's
one of the things I think that could
help new shooters in the future is
trying to incorporate more freedom yeah
so um what I things we notice a little
bit is that a lot of people tend to
think that shooters are kind of similar
to each other and this is where the
reason is bringing this question is
because a lot of people are looking for
ways to stand out but my next question
is how important is it to stand it I
mean how important is it to do something
other than okay with really tightly made
mechanics where you're a soldier in that
media you know for that shot and how
much of that is a try the developing
process to go beyond it or is ok to
knock your ventra actually begin to
fight that have something
otherwise it's going to be too broad
right it does about what that is
necessarily but it has to be something
ask you something special about me to
try some retailers are going that want
to 80 money to play your hand and want
to even give up there even more better
spend a lot of your project goals to
just finish playing through spec ops 2
lines they may have to play a few people
highly recommend it it looks like a very
ill be appreciated for star playing and
then like stuff starts to happen and
goes this whole way of progression is
it's like you're saying it's a really
great way to talk about a story and
character development all these things
that really make it separate it's not
just
there's no need to walk away from
something that works well these
international artists are tired industry
or 30 years now anything worked really
really well and stepping with just the
same time he finds something you need to
add that
yeah I think that's the real key is if
you mention the whole question is yeah
feels really tight control really well I
think that's all good at once i have
that but guess would be that first I
score as the base layer game if you
don't have that it doesn't matter how to
make or whatever cool your game is it's
not going to do very well and after you
received very well that's that's the big
key of developers we try to now I was
getting you with your right now is if
you have whatever your spin is on that
we try to do as well as a let's take
something and put our own stone so this
of course is looking fine and everything
but as far as trench concern one of the
things that we've really started to
notice to specialize by Pierce is this I
can't emphasis on multiplayer components
it's something that particular to this
Sean people really enjoy so how
important is this multiplayer component
and do we have a future in the genre
where people step back and focus again
Warmack and ammo or is that a death
sentence for type
currently especially if you don't have
Bart groaning you're probably not
getting really just recently Frankie but
yeah actually cannot bubbly instead if
you are working on it can't make the
game service then we don't want to be
but I think there will be people who
break out and really do a good job of
telling a story and create an
interesting characters that are
connected and they exam is I think
that's going to come from more than any
loads our developers that are out there
that are gonna be getting more Marcel
coach yeah actually the same thing at
the Triple A or whatever that is these
days there is a few shows
attack on
the chance to top stories i think is
still there
it's like but for me it's not just
percentage it's more about active games
are oftentimes escaped with their often
times also a great chance to bring
people together so it's not necessarily
multiplayer as much as bringing people
too
could be co-opted in me asynchronous is
just around other people online extend
your network conferences and cooperative
yes
I think here's war two of the organ
donors like the b-mode for that game
gears of war choose will declare out of
boxes was not the best but board was
fantastic and all your people together
and that's to me the clock development
really i don't i guess i understand i
don't think that spec but you should
have a social aspect a multiplayer
aspect that's one of the ways of
exploding right now
I understand
so you brought a publisher issue a
little bit when you said II kind of came
out and said this is what we're doing
this is where we're coming you guys are
on through most part of the creative end
your game makers non-game sellers to a
point so are you happy about that I mean
does it make you feel confined
creatively is it something you don't
mind so you at anyway there's certainly
a financial perspective maybe set games
multiplayer are doing better on market
but how does that work for you when
you're the one behind scenes actually
making it personally for me I love
whether it's go out for them like more
more these ages you see more co-op
campaign shows that that allow them to
or even four players or more to go
through the actual support campaign I
think that trend is is going to really
log 2013
caricatures but as far as what I want to
make I enjoyed wear shoes I it doesn't
really affect
I think that it's harder Gator gopher
must have in their name somebody else's
penis that's always kind of your dream
so the trick is finding something that
you love doing that publisher blogs in
addition to free number 22 everybody
wants to talk to me for two years that's
more than I guess this question George
even have on the ocean and I think
that's also huge
do what they wanted to accomplish
to be honest sometimes strengths of our
creativity they're told okay you need to
have a call campaign that tells the
civil suit larry campaign and written
great solar company that is very focused
on specific individual moments well as a
design challenge that's an area
challenging job they can really drive in
traditional creators things you wouldn't
necessarily done without having that
actually founder
so I mean a certain question is how does
it make me feel being a creative design
your games sure I mean I do you feel
cramped like your train that you have to
go to San Jose it makes me really happy
to be honest it's a it's an awesome job
to be able to get in arguments with
coworkers over rocket launcher higher
rate kind of like that you know that was
the you know looking at whatever just
another not a job you know I mean yeah
did some jobs i don't i love i love
being able to talk with people and to
come up with environments systems that
players will play with and I don't
suppose mr. eggs are good as well such
as no constraints and again we'll never
so this is perhaps the best example
because no one at this table is with its
ok if it's safe to me but right now I
think one of the things gamers feel
about the genre is that we're slipping
in some ways into a sequel culture not
just with first-person shooters I mean
all sorts of games movies are suffering
from this but what do you guys think
about what I might call like a nigger if
series right so like call of duty we've
got one two three
force equals on sequels and so forth is
this part of the genre is this something
that as we move into the future and
continue to bring all these ideas you
guys are talking about yes I got a
weaponsmith multiple stuff is that
earning history is it stopping by fuel
from making games like your website name
and so forth or is interesting flavors
from what they want where's that balance
I personally you know that they had
adopted pretty much the baton you know
every early early release I don't think
that's necessary early the genres whole
but because they had to and they mix it
up they try something new I mean I
beulah the biggest most exciting thing
is ending and you can drop her ultimate
you know they had some small who wants a
feature every year and they might
subtract some that add a few more
technical features but they add
something there
push I think as long as I doing that and
they don't just punch out just release
and are not advancing something you know
the story from telling a new story
putting it into a new setting can be
somewhat try and timeline but as far as
only back the drama I don't think it is
I think I think looking for shooters out
is a good as long as as long as the
with the chakra
got some
that if you
well
take some chances try some good things
because they know that the next
iteration was working classes in theater
sure
yeah you better get yer I long as you
keep you focused the interest is there
then yesterday to share kind of key
that's why I'm here and eventually
you're just there until all
soccer turn yeah i agree i think that's
more like what we talked about
kind of a service every year you gotta
renew your subscription or sixty dollars
i guess one could be called you example
but at the same time the we want to talk
about the corba cancer all there but
those games are different to agree to
have you know different eras of their
enemies you know this year is the black
ops year and i think there's there's a
definitely different I don't think it
hurts me Deshawn oh I think it it allows
other people to to see what they do
maybe well and eventually maybe put
their spin on that or something with it
and I personally it's a good thing to
get that many people playing the genre
of employers there's a lot of people
playing this game there's a lot of
people playing that sugar and I think
it's developers think it's nice to have
that many people interested in the genre
if you're developing sure
see while why people enter here comes
Elvis selfish corner units also really
cool to see how they tackle the same
problem to have anal as a developer how
they handle the same situations we were
trying to do and it's also like that if
like if it was trying to one-up 10 so
the games continue so how much
crossbreeding is there you guys take a
lot of inspiration from other games you
slices and stay away from that idea you
know something that was ripples that you
don't worry games on this platings and
bleh everybody loved playing games and
so even if it's just so conscious to
absorb else is out there to see what
benchmarks been said
and then also you know I might be
inspired by somebody or feature or
mechanical within it and and I
understand go buddy you would actually
take it and it gives you a view idea
news Anton also we have this new way of
approaching that one thing to thin
enough that it comes in economy has like
there's a whole parable that there's
only two stories in the world history
teacher comes to town or somebody goes
on a trip to the island i wish the same
storage the Occident so maybe it's all
my reputation yes i play
sure
games how did you how they do what
they're doing I was just
and I think my number one tip for for
this is play the be rated games well
games that are you would consider not to
be time for today awesome franchises
play the games that are based on like a
movie franchise you know play the games
aren't like I said probably a bit of the
better games the reason the one play
those is because there's a lot of good
things in finding people that they take
risks and you'll be able to find
interesting really cool things that
happen in those containers and then you
can even take that and apply that to
your game so what's a little bit more
about innovation in a different way
we've got up a lot of stuff coming out
right we've got motion controls I'm sure
you guys to see me oculus arrest right
kind of the armor etc what are you guys
what do you want just personated do you
want better graphics so much more
realistic graphics you want the motion
controls what are you looking for for
your next hand if you have it if it was
a fantasy world I think I'm going to
have more ways to engage the player and
bring them into the game but also Hugh
pulse rate where the books are looking
at like literally like oculus rift you
know you're going to have this device in
your head way it going on and that will
bring out you know all the sudden all
the third person shooters are now you
might start seeing more of a slight back
to push more security because that right
but just imagine having some sensors
that are on the inside of the thing
detected your heart a your temper your
body temperature and kind of reacting
and the game knows you look at certain
things you are you're bored now gotta
mix it up in the game system actually
it's fine indian right right or throw
surprised at you your sins committed
this is going to sound like your path
eventually i want more more think you
are waking up later
the water accessing the better the
technology for facial animation and
interaction and anything else that might
be my child well
you later tell a better story to meet
lighting that affects you more directly
that doesn't get the Weaver gateways and
were seen as part of your experience so
every technological advancement long I'm
ready for it I want to know what I
take that
I'm used even in a lot of ways to be
opposite
I want to stay client experience and
just into core of what then what a game
is and engage player the players are
together so I don't really care as much
what the input device is or how we get
there I just wanted to make a simple
understandable experienced and tuned to
get a new booking experience I'm with
the kind of the original question when I
won games what I want I definitely want
to play game her look substantially
better next gen I wanna see something
that i would say it passes the mock test
you know your mom walks in the room and
she looks at TV and it looks amazing and
she like oh that looks amazing but she
doesn't notice that looks amazing that
must pass the desk right that's when I
was playing my dance 64 for the first
time I was family had two thousand my
dad walks in it's like all that looks so
like realistic that was you know like 12
years and he was like that looks so real
like red skins on TV like I know look at
his daddy and this when you tackled it
looks great and for me I want the next
generation I wanted to really to be that
input glasses
my juices yeah whatever but visually
monitor really want to be able to have
my mom when she comes to visit she must
cease oh my gosh it was amazing just
begin devices tortures a lot of game go
straight else is I think time to have
these really like tight controls I mean
most games offer you know sometimes into
10 or more different configurations of
buttons and its really become a thing
you know somebody is good at what sugar
sometimes they can carry over to find
someone configuration and use those
exact same skills do you think we're
going to hit point anytime soon where
that primary input device can change and
how much you to change so here's an
example when we came out and we got all
the wii sports right you got me open and
there's a point where it can only get so
real before it eventually just need a
bulk then throw it and if you had motion
controls with let's say you come foo
game you never want to take you to that
11 ratio of control because we don't
actually have comfort why homes before
myself but I'd say I think probably cam
fights of the integra program so where
is that cap for the sugar is that cap
where we have people
virtual reality feel like a hollow debt
you know actually holding a gun or is
that future sitting with this type you
know buttons represent action inspector
in one yeah that one buttons which I
think I always be around I always be
quick real simple either they're tapped
out but I think eventually in this light
way I'm not saying with two years from
now we have a holiday experience but it
is coming all the system you can purge
oh you got the connecting into to
recognize like literally the connectives
to give your basic country at how you
feeling emotions happy very sad or angry
or frustrated in the game could account
I think I think a lot of Ottomans rivers
converge and we're gonna slowly see okay
now i have a projection display that
just gives me a sense that i'm in a
different apartment i'm not just and I
started hearing medical all homes and
uses something on your wall every
peripheral
and and you just turned out react to me
stuff like that actually I'm obviously
not going to merge as we drive tours
really i think the end the most in tune
because that on one page with a fantasy
what we can imagine around this yeah i
mean if i want a thing is on space
that's the biggest hang-up i think is
more talking like holiday stuff like
unless we have a warehouse a dedicated
to some virtual reality all in place and
it's really hard and then and you're
walking on a treadmill you know through
a jungle and it looks like you know it's
space is limited we got our living room
or we've got our office we got a mouse
and keyboard controller and i think
that's that's going to be the hardest
thing so we thought about is being able
to escape into something i'll pick it up
on my couch and with my fingers I can
block a guy through military complex or
through the hospital and so I think
it'll it'll be a while till we can
actually get into something where my
space is affected by me walking through
it I don't know how we'll be able to do
that someday but that's I think until we
can figure out something about that
we're going to have to be using our
there's something that's somewhat
stationary or using and
physical personality people of this hand
controls where you move how like with a
controller your left thumb is your
movement and your right thumb is here
your look if it's virtual reality you
can't be moving I physically to feed
maybe this is I'm going forward back
right hands gave me I can see something
along that line so I put on a headset
eat with this hand have a one-to-one
aiming and they're not running it's
almost like connecting away but I kind
of like the hard way I like being a
holding of this or this must be Morgan's
that's kind of game on the Dinosaur now
I rejected say that I'm a terrible
person answers questioning that there's
some national for submissions
there's also cameras
I actually have a question does it make
me think that somebody's gonna solve
like what we met from NASA keyboard to
control I will stay always art has the
success of Android Ice Road tested
virtual gallery star wars are shoes
this
people want to play these years well I
know one of the things I've been doing
with them is like objects reality where
you're looking through the screen at a
world where you know enemies this kind
of primitive moment or reading popping
behind walls and your actual in your
kitchen you know they're looking at you
know kind of the three four maybe so
there's some animation that I've seen
out there but of the most part that list
of people that I spoke to from the
flavor side they're not there in I don't
know anyone who is a part for like I
gotta rush home from school woman there
whatever sugar dumbass it's impossible
so what's been to genre forward and
again this counter play Tetris okay but
one of the things that people are
talking about as cheers from out and
multiplayer kind of gay for attention is
the single player campaigns maybe
getting less attention not so much in
mechanics because that carries over
multiplayer but perhaps from a campaign
or narrative standpoint so the next
question is what do you think about
story and is it okay to forgive what a
quote something that is not necessarily
a complete story maybe it's too short
it's poorly written in some people's
opinions is that forgivable if you have
game that excels on a purely mechanical
level probably one person I have that
strong story I think one of the great
fallacies are constrained the shooter
genre
person narrative from game it's all part
of later experience it's very doesn't
have to be long that we need doesn't
have to be any other than fun as long as
it's appropriate to the player
experience and developing your story
along with the rest the game so that
reinforce you can wave game delivery
person and together they made for a
better their experiences but you have to
strive for shortchanging jewelry is the
same shortchanging any other element of
your game
I I didn't think that the industry's
concept of stories 30 games like a queen
really fantastic story
controls totally separate issue you are
standing still very popular for pumpkins
but I have just as much of an attachment
to the story Dunkey the baikonur story
oh because for me and this is kind of
equipment in earlier I think as well is
that the story is what the player makes
the player story is way more important
than whatever sorry I'm trying to tell
and their personal experience is what
they're going to remember not like this
convoluted series of characters in the
world and enumerated so I hope that
means we're focusing sure should be
allowing empowering the players stories
especially for babies more
like lions whatever people usually don't
work out the main story county job and
water corner or whatever what they did
last night and an awesome random thing
that took place and how they overcame
right and but if you have a leader
shooter that or some of your shoe that
is on a versatile sweet story about of
those specific set of characters the
player visit selecting free then I think
I think that is on but if you are doing
sure did
we have bad controls in that somebody
has paid
talking about experiencing tightness and
that's something that
appropriate in order we're not letting
this or here putting the building watch
the story
later experience
they make their scoring on coming out
yeah I mean me I prefer story a simple
story the batter cannot appointing would
be let you know like what do you want to
do the original do you shoot a bunch of
demons from hell all right and but the
levels are really cool because it's not
very linear me a and B point A to point
B it's the same location but there's a
lot of choice between those levels will
secret passages things like that mess
and but dude felt really good without
really good blasting people with that
shocking absolutely on any dating those
fireballs and you know holding down the
shift key would be really quickly
there's a lot of empowerment to the
player there that in a way a lot of lot
more modern teams lost every way that
protective Janine has a right I mean
it's always a silent protagonist doesn't
talk Gordon Freeman or heavy on
Drake and just a handsome and different
sorts of books may I think the simpler
the story and don't even worry about the
story as much or more about the design I
think that's where you have sure that
has a higher chance of being more
successful that's a funny one you'll
feel better so then what is the most
important thing to get right when you
sit down your starting work on the game
you say that's everything else up in
this game what is the one as small as
you can get component today right
meaning gameplay is not shooting the
ocean right but you need like the
technically controls I mean like a when
you say like making the shooting right I
mean what is that what are you trying to
damn because at the end of the day at
least from a player's perspective so
that he doesn't design games I think of
a short way more complicated as as my
thumb's joystick and their radical
groups over envy and it was fun and be
dice and that's the core experience most
players right so what makes it different
between games what are you guys doing
focus
that that's changing a lot to keep being
boiled down to just feel like there are
so many things like you need to say the
rebels and people know Gables the thing
on the screen is a circle another that
they usually feedback and a lot of
people don't notice it we're going to
scamper or don't you know just focus and
I but it's telling your over an enemy
it's probably true it's getting tighter
we have a better shot it's quite blown
out you know when you when you're
running moving because you don't have to
like there's a lot of feedback in
something as
so there's so many factors to consider
any cheap and if there's a key factors
in the system just for feedback to the
player right away it's imagining the
shoes model every conversion to that I
go the feedback especially because the
does the results of fire and weapons
week or what the player has their mind
the psychology minor you have a shotgun
we shoot someone at close range you have
a certain expectancy what do you think
would happen there same thing if he had
a sniper rifle to shoot something far
away you the result needs to match them
and if it doesn't that's where the
shooting doesn't feel good that is the
sniper rifle not an accurate weapon that
kind of doesn't make sense it's
microwave and as you notice funny games
that haven't made over just these simple
things I polish shop now I should
someone close range depend on the rating
of your game whether it's for sure not
you know there's more people exploded
all over let's shoot something with each
other again we can go back to shooting
those green toxic barrels next one him
and that implied jibs fly in the
opposite direction of that right there
feels amazing so we brought this up a
little bit earlier when we go back to
her for a second which is the idea of
any game CalPERS I think right now with
players here indeed their mind for the
most part doesn't go to change it goes
to innovative platform reverse puzzlers
you know the topic at once I'm sure
there is a issue in community out there
but do you think that they're
competitive against the quote unquote
triple-a those things were just talking
about dining in that feedback and
designing all of those components is
that something that they can move to it
and if it's everything in it what are
you guys doin with the rest of this
pleasure put into other time you step
into projects I think the reason you
don't see these years the cyclods of
perversions my house because they're
harder to make and make something right
I'm going to take a lot of time
energy of Argentine
great
but pitch ins then we can the hours
closer to me they are starting to
equalize
Andy's will move into the ship re
because they will have more stuff
package ready to go that will help them
jumpstart into doing something hopefully
they they have laser focus on one point
innovation one thing that and maybe get
it out in a little fasteners but they
go for we talked about making sure that
it is just three general V at 3d to be a
small indie team you need to then start
blogging characters and 3d always
animations effects you need 3d
environments but you could make it
shooter a platform share this to me my
contractor is the shooter right
direction sugarcane you know smash TV to
awesome game as well as a shooter game
and that's something that I need to get
and kind of do it here or you get street
cred that way and these monies welcome
to license right that's where I think it
helps those guys that's that's been a
big boon to have licensed private
the person shooters respective lives
these days
our and a lot of the other genres it
sounded brooch
15
interesting with
Francis a better
we'll be able to mention before that
alternately we could see
that's for counting
chance of success happy they are
we're still considered a small you need
so yeah us all the studios as well yes
that's all that's not here but yeah
there are things out there that are
doing it you're saying earlier
the most part they're all following just
how successful they were to fight
multi-million dollar budgets
the most notable that I've seen that
just a millionaire talking make sure my
dad's are that project and we think they
started I think that's what they really
want to really describe and I can't so
it's coming right so you know some lot
of what you guys are saying is that
indie games as far as this genre have a
little it's a little hard for table as
opposed to something like that 2d
platformer so if they're shot after a
little while there's kind of this
perception right now that the big
publishers are a bit more leery of
individual visits whiskey right Andrea
budget
the less you want to risk so there's
this idea that a lot of the new
innovation is coming through in the game
so if they are being slightly more shut
out from this particular genre does that
mean that as we move forward the shooter
genre will stagnate more than convenient
chocolates taking a new set of movies or
books or entertainment you're not going
to make it extra mainstream what people
say that's true this kind of weird if
not earlier is that you just kind of
have to find that thing that makes you
special it makes you stand out build up
enough momentum again and even though
there's a lot of singing cheers out
there i would say genres noun stagnated
in the past few years lots of really
exciting things
reiteration of every game or a new title
he comes out so if they're just kind of
how big against it who touches on
alright well I've got one more question
for you guys I want to open up to some
Q&amp;amp;A with the ions and some fire question
if you had total control of a team of
wherever you want and unlimited budget
what's your next year look like what is
it yeah the other space single words no
restraint for watching ice cream so
maybe I can bring this down to a more
manageable level to question didn't say
is there anything that you've personally
ever really wanted to do but for
whatever reason it's not your job title
imagine control the strength of wherever
coming that you haven't been able to put
in your game at any idea for its
narrative mechanic liability is there
something that you had a stream to get
it
you have done yet whatever me this is me
I feel free happy with what I'm doing as
far as what we're building over at epic
but one thing that I think regards to
the future and what really cool and
different is shooters are shooters you
go to e3 see what's coming and what is
always been there it's a lot of our
games are built around I guess a violent
nature right kill this guy I feel like I
point a point me do this what I think
would be really interesting is if in the
future we could ever make again with
shooter type of candidates that actually
isn't that the coding and addressing
isn't violent right you're not killing
people what if there was a you know this
is kind of like if you look at say dead
space dead space is very violent killing
these freakish monsters but the guy's an
engineer i was like what if that game
was drastically different and you aren't
actually killing any listings
and repair things even with the same
mechanics right and I don't know if us
as a culture will ever be interested in
playing the game house what if I miss
emergency medical have to get over here
to all these wounded soldiers and do
some really cool game mechanics trying
to advantage this guy or you date other
people that are trying to be and lead a
team like I said being a backup that it
or what if there's a cool fire banking
back drafting movie is awesome make a
thing what if there's a really cool
fireman game and I think that is
something that could totally be done I
just don't know as a culture lead that
interested in making a game where I
don't blow people or creatures or aliens
and monsters and ready for me it was it
would be something that brings everyone
in it all measurements and emic get hurt
I don't know what that is whether it's
like a game that I play the console at
home with my sister plays on her phone
and somebody else reads a book and then
I'll talk about the store where I don't
know and whatever that is which is
something that brings everyone
so we share whatever that experience
even two different devices what if your
grandma's on her her phone and I found
that out of my reading and I remind
bombs by an angry birds she's never
played a game for what are you doing I
need to get all the stars in this level
okay longer man you took my Nintendo
were lots of kids doing in school yeah I
think bringing people together that's
another local gamers have someone you
know may be directed troops on there I
have and there's the troops are people
playing first-person shooter I don't
think all that stuff is coming we got
smart class yeah sunny motorboat me you
all that scum we
directions they don't have to be as hard
as
the shooters are normally perceive this
very hard especially the multiplayer she
was a high barrier country there's a
fear of new lose that are going to talk
about that they're going to trash talk
me become a monk all up for the team
right I would love to create something
that kind of slow rank these players
player and it's um it's keeps the genre
grown because if nobody else knew comes
in to approach it on right now then
we're going to run to impress I think I
think we'd even more use and ideas like
they're up everything talk about this
more blessed and
push what's on the screen check that I
can arrive in a little stress wave and
we just need to come up with ways
players also grab a controller and maybe
have an object win whether it's going
around
or just that kind of person chosen you
know every over has their green project
there is make some day most of us have
45
the most threat for the animal tracks it
will be a taxi to QK concepts but really
is the next game
I can't
go inside of these papers I've gotta
break that we also
well I want to open it up to some
questions from the audience if you guys
have questions we do me a favor and when
I'm here we're going to bring Mike can
get to as many as you can for our silent
so the life story please before much
