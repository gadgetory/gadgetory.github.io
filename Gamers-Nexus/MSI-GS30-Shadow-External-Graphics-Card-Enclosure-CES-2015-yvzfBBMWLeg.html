Nexus tonight this is our final coverage
of msi is sweet all this coverage of
course brought to you by cyber power and
their vapor gaming console this is a GS
30 shadow which is pretty cool it
reminds me of something we saw from
silverstone last year that hasn't been
put out yet because of some kind of
legal issues but basically you've got a
laptop with a docking station and the
docking station is capable of equipping
whatever basically video card you want
to throw in there technically they
support msi and reference cards but you
can throw md or nvidia in there and then
you mount your laptop to the docking
station it connects via PCIe and it's a
proprietary connector that goes up
through the dock it feeds through the
dock and it is a pcie 3.0 by 16 dock or
interface rather so that's it's it's not
gonna throttle you at all and that
connects down to the video card the
video card is supported by a 450 watt
power supply in the front there's a
pretty big speaker system for what we
have so there's a speaker system in
there if you wanted one and then it's
got a 3.5 inch hard drive dock if you
want to add a hard drive in terms of the
laptop itself it's got a 4870 HQ Intel
processor it is thirteen point three
inches and and everything else is fairly
standard so you can check out all this
information in the link in the
description below price is about 1699
1700 MSRP and yeah that's the GSEs 30
shadow buy</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
