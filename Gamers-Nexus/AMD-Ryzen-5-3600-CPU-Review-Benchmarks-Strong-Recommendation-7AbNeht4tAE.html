acts that we're also reviewing AMD
launched its r5 3600 today to the public
we got a production sample of one of the
r5 3600 cpus through a third party and
after seen its performance we wanted to
focus first on this one for our initial
rise in 3000 review this CPU is supposed
to be a $200 part we've been
recommending and these are our five CPUs
since the first generation as intel's i5
see views have seen struggles lately and
frame time consistency and are often
close enough to AMD that the versatility
same time consistency and close enough
came in performance have warranted r5
purchases today we're revisiting with
the r5 3606 core 12 thread cpu so look
at gaming production workloads like
premier blender and v-ray and more power
consumption and overclocking before that
this video is brought to you by
gigabytes X 570 ARS master motherboard
built with a true 14 phase vrm and for a
high-end rise in 3000 series built the
gigabyte X 570 master uses a properly
finned heat sink for VR I'm cooling
accompanied by RGB LEDs in the i/o cover
to makes it looks and performance
gigabyte also includes BIOS flash
features to update the motherboard BIOS
without a CPU or RAM the overbuilt BRM
is the major feature on this board
though and gigabyte has a brand new BIOS
for overclocking the new rise in 3003
CPUs learn more at the link in the
description below a couple of quick
notes on this this CPU was not sent out
by AMD and so this is a production
sample but it's from a third party and
that means that you probably won't see
too many of these reviews just yet but
they are going to be sold so these will
be $200 to the r5 3600 there's an X Q as
well the XQ has a 200 megahertz higher
advertised boost frequency whereas this
one's at 3200 that would be at 3400
megahertz so those are the main
differences that there's price
difference as well but just like
previous generations where you can buy
the non XQ and an overclock it to match
the XQ that's basically the only
difference it's the frequency and
everything else is the same between the
XQ 3600 and the non XQ so you could buy
this one an overclock it or because
we've already overclocked it in our
charts you can look at that data and
then extrapolate where the X would land
if you do prefer that one our 3900 X
3,700 X overclocked with much better
voltages although the same frequency
then our 3,600 and some of that is
potentially because of the higher NCP is
requiring higher quality silicon so
that's part of it probably will note
also that the CPS a and V cent had
thermal paste left on them so something
to take note of as well but our 3600
although it overclocked reasonably it
did require a lot more voltage and then
our 3900 X we'll talk about that more in
the 3900 X review which is coming up
after this one and after our 5700 XT
review so those were the main notes
other than that all Windows updates up
to 1903 have been applied for our new
CPU test bench and BIOS mitigations have
been applied for Intel CPUs we're on the
latest bios for just about everything
unless there was a reason not to you for
example the AMD BIOS is for a risin
3,000 there are a couple that are
questionable right now so for by us
we're using fc5 for the gigabyte X 570
master that's the mother would we used
for all of our new rise in testing that
you'll be seeing this week and we do
have other boards as well but we're
starting with that one the F clock is
another thing I want to mention so the
Infinity fabric clock is going to be a
big part of overclocking for this
generation of Verizon from what we
understand
we've done some F clock overclocking and
it won't be included in this review
because without also overclocking the
memory it doesn't really do a whole lot
and at least vs. auto so we're going to
be visiting F clock in a separate piece
and we're also doing some xoc
liquid-nitrogen overclocking hopefully
this week with Rison and X 570 CPUs so
we'll have a lot of depth on that coming
up as we tinker with it with liquid
nitrogen
timings for this updated bench have been
very heavily controlled so we've
improved our test bench and our testing
methodology significantly for this round
of testing we are now manually
controlling more or less every single
timing and BIOS before we did the
important ones but now we've controlled
all of them so our FC for example can
have a pretty big impact and it's to the
extent that it just it tightens the air
margin so it's an extra plus or minus 1%
closer every time we do the runs and now
sometimes it's 0.1 FPS different run to
run which
fantastic let's get straight into it we
like to illustrate CPU behavior on new
architecture launches part of this is to
look for boost duration limitations or
power fluctuations something we'll cover
next the first chart shows frequency
over time with a blender workload which
is a 3d rendering application hitting
all cores nearly equally the average all
core frequency ends I've had about 40
104 megahertz the CBA was under a to 80
millimeter CLC with 22 degree ambient
for this test
so boost behavior was not thermally
affected the CPU has an advertised boost
clock of 42 hundred megahertz which will
apply for workloads that don't fully
load the core is that 100% there's
minimal fluctuation with this frequency
plot and it does not appear that any
boost duration limits come into play
boost eration limits are typically close
to the 100 second mark for example for a
better view of this well plot each core
clock individually and with the y-axis
constrained to Jeff's 40 50 to 40 200
megahertz the point of this is to
magnify the data as observed here
pre-testing starts with cores bouncing
off of the 40 200 megahertz a limited
core turbo while still an idle once the
work begins the cores take turns
bursting up to 40 125 megahertz and
falling back to 4100 with rare dips down
to 40 80 will keep drawing other cores
as we go here there doesn't seem to be a
preference for which core boosts up to
40 125 but they all do it at some point
a pattern emerges where cores 0 and 1
will pass the ball back and forth and
then on to cores 4 &amp;amp; 5 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 3 seems to
do similar at the end of the day they
all take turns boosting will use Shadow
the Tomb Raider at 1080p to give a
gaming look at frequency behavior well
so skip straight to the zoomed in chart
for a better highlight of the boosting
in this chart we stay closer to an
average of 41 75 mega Hertz boost went
under heavier loads with the lighter
threaded scenes rendered we see single
core boosts up to 40 200 megahertz the
maximum stock boost before falling back
to 41 52 4175 as for the core number 5
dip below the chart range that spike
falls to about 3300 megahertz we use two
of total war hammer tears baked in
benchmarks starting with battle designs
a test performance on the RTS map we
also test with the campaign for a look
at turn-based vantage points strategy
games are a good place to demonstrate
performance for CPUs as AI processing is
often CPU intensive the higher end Intel
CPU is a 1080p approach AGP
bottleneck with a maximum average FPS of
174 for the 5.1 gigahertz 9900 K and
these are five 2600 and are five 1600
came nowhere close to this limit
previously with the overclocked 4.2
gigahertz 2600 maxing out at 145 FPS
average the r5 3600 makes a big step
towards closing that gap with a stock
average of 159 fps a twenty seven point
three percent improvement over the stock
1600 and a 10% improvement over the
overclocked 2600 4.2 gigahertz core
overclocked in the 3600 yielded a minor
3 FPS improvement to 162 FPS average but
leaving the frequency stock and
disabling SMT bumps the 3600 score up to
equal the stock 9600 K placing at 166
FPS average we've observed in the past
that total warhammer - and some other
games can react negatively to hyper 13
or SMT so this is one way of leveling
that out with these six core six thread
9600 K we first broke this information
in the first generation rise in reviews
and it seems that this persists here we
wouldn't recommend actually disabling
SMT as the usefulness is a wash between
games some like it some don't and
ultimately it's better to have the extra
threads that is half the reason you're
buying the processor anyway this is more
of an exercise to demonstrate behavior
in Zen to versus the original House for
the 9600 K the stock performance that
leads the stock 3600 by 4.4 percent
they're close enough that other
applications may matter more than this
Delta we'll look at production workloads
later the total war 1440p battle
benchmark is a GPU bottleneck so we
can't see any CPU differences until we
get to the bottom of the chart we'll
move on from this one quickly and leave
discussion for it in the article below
if you want to read a bit more
the second Total War benchmark uses the
campaign map as seen in the grand
strategy portion of the game it's much
more CPU dependent than the battle
benchmark so we'll start with 1080p at
1080 P there are 5 3600 stock 155 FPS
average shows a 7% improvement over the
2600 overclocked to 4.2 gigahertz and a
33% improvement over the stock 1600 this
beats the full range of older six core
12 thread a and the parts overclocked or
not overclocked in the 3600 itself was
ineffectual in this test as it was with
the total war battle benchmark but again
disabling SMT offered a
to performance that made the 36 hundreds
performance around the stock in 96
hundred KS both at 161 to 165 FPS
average that's stock to stock frequency
the 9600 K has much more overclocking
Headroom with a 13 percent to FPS
improvement from stock the 5.2 gigahertz
in this test and a not an impressive 183
FPS average the 1440p results aren't as
GP bottlenecks like they were in the
battle benchmark but that also means
that much of the chart lines up with the
1080p results the 3600 with SMT disabled
lost some of its edge here with the 3600
overclocked outperforming it slightly
and the stock to 9600 K just beyond that
so 1440p sometimes will matter for the
CPU choice and sometimes it won't like
with a battle benchmark where we saw
they all more or less equal if you have
1440p there with any of the top end or
even mid-range CPUs you're going to be
limited by the GPU choice f1 2018 is up
next a DirectX 11 standard
implementation of the game on the ego
engine everyone 2018 runs out higher
frame rates than any human could require
in our 1080p testing but it still shows
good scaling between CPUs the stock 3600
to 67 FPS average is again well ahead of
the previous best score for the six core
12 thread AMD parts surpassing the
overclocked 2600 to 35 FPS average by
14% and the old stock and the RFI of
1600 by 34 percent overclocking at 3,600
again had very little effect and he's
done a good enough job at boosting per
core frequency that is difficult to
improve the performance with an all core
overclock at least in lightly threaded
applications like games
everyone is another title where
disabling SMT raises performance
although not quite to the level of the
9600 K this time we climb to 273 FPS
average with SMT off and stock clocks
it's possible that disabling hyper
threading would give a slight boost to
many of the CPUs on our charge but it's
rarely worth going into BIOS and cutting
a CPUs thread count in half for a minor
performance increase in some video work
and some gaming workloads the only
reason we're treating the CPUs
differently is because it's a new
architecture and we want to see if SMT
overhead has changed in the past two
years
here's a quick frame time chart with
have 120 18 at 1080p
remember that lower is better but more
consistent is better than just being
lower overall the r5 3600 remains close
to 4.3 to 5.0 millisecond frame to frame
intervals and typically we don't notice
stutters unless there's an excursion
equal
to or greater than eight to twelve
milliseconds frame-to-frame something
that only happens once in this benchmark
for both tests and it happens on both
the 9600 K and the 3600 the same spot
and the same test overall these two
processors have similar frame time
pacing and consistency with at least
this game with the 9600 K faster by 0.3
milliseconds on average frames of frame
1440p f1 is next the CB is at 240 FPS
average and above are almost entirely GP
limited but all of our 3600 results fall
just short of that range the narrower
range of results means that all three
stock overclocked and SMT disable to the
3600 averaged almost exactly the same
the 9600 case still went out by 4.5
percent stock versus stock technically
speaking although the value of the 3600
is a tough match for it particularly in
later tests and with the lower price the
top-end of the results hit the GPU limit
so note that all differences are within
error margins that's why the 9900 KOC
isn't at the top it's because it
bouncing off the limits so any Delta
here is just run to run variance we do
multiple passes of the new gathering
storm AI benchmark for Civilization six
each of which takes an average
completion time for 5 turns
and then averages those numbers together
it's the only game test we do that isn't
too measured by frame times and the
results are extremely consistent we took
a look at turn time instead as this is
entirely CPU dependent and heavily
impacts how enjoyable the experience is
unfortunately despite being an AI
benchmark it shows a strong preference
for frequency over thread count as can
be seen by the r5 1600 at 3.2 gigahertz
base outperforming the r7 1700 at 3
gigahertz base the 9600 K stock took 34
seconds to complete each turn reducing
the average turn time by 5% versus the
3600 stock and the overclocked to 9600 K
is far beyond the overclocked 3600 and
performance at 30 point 3 seconds versus
35 point 3 multiplied across all five AI
turns that means it take an extra 25
seconds per turn for the human player to
have input again and that be more
exaggerated as the game grows
complicated Assassin's Creed origins has
revealed itself to be one of the most
balanced titles we test in terms of
benefiting from frequency and core count
at the same time disabling SMT you had
an appropriately negative results for
once so it's the stock six core 12
thread 3600 results that slightly edges
out to the 96 hundred K by one
1 FPS average more or less within error
margins at that point so they are
functionally tied interestingly the
overclocked results for the two CPUs are
fairly close as well the 12 threads of
the 4.3 gigahertz 3600 bring it closer
to the 5.1 gigahertz 9600 K than we've
seen in the previous tests with only a
7.4 percent advantage for the Intel chip
the 3600 is also the first of AMD's X
600 series CPUs to bring 60 fps and a
0.1% lows which it does even at stock
frequencies at 1440p the 3,600 3,600 OC
and the stock 9600 k are all within
error margins of each other
the results are pushed together closer
by the GPU constraints for this one the
9600 k OC still has an advantage but
again everything is clumped together a
bit more GTA 5 is next the oldest game
on our bench still has some life left in
it thanks to some settings tweaks to
further load on the CPU and it's also
still one of the most played games on
Steam it's another title we're just a
way now since he allowed for a
performance increase of a few FPS but
not past the stock 9600 K this time
frequency is important in this title and
a lack of major improvement with a 3600
overclock all core settings indicates
how close the stock boost frequencies
already are to the maximum achievable
all core overclock we'll be interested
to see whether the 3600 2x can justify
its $50 higher price with what seems
like very little room for improvement
and these generational improvements are
as strong as ever here with a 20.7%
uplift over the stock 2600 and a 37.4%
improvement over the stock 1600 pretty
good scaling at 1440p between 1080p and
1440p is almost perfect for GTA 5 with
only the nearly tied overclocked 2600 ax
and Sox 7600 K trading blazes FPS
numbers themselves are also barely
changed meaning we're a healthy distance
from a GPU bottleneck or the observe the
FPS cap of about 180 7.5 FPS for this
engine you would have to go to a high
resolution or even higher settings to
limit the GPU down to a point where the
CPU is bottleneck shadow of the Tomb
Raider is another one of the minority
games we're leaving SMT enabled gives us
a better result
the stock 3600 showed an 18% improvement
over the average FPS and the stock r5
2600 but with barely any further
improvement from overclocking the
generational improvements are big but
it's the same story as it has been
manufacturers
squeeze performance out of parts more
efficiently these days so stock
performance goes up and
walking Headroom can go down as a result
the 9600 K is one part that still has
some room left and the 5.1 gigahertz I
see put at 13% ahead of the overclocks
3600 due to popular demand we've
switched to DirectX 12 for our hitman to
testing DX 12 support was passed into
the game relatively recently and any
previously published benchmarks from us
in the CPU side were done using dx11 we
use both 11 and 12 for GPU reviews know
that dx11 has better frame time pacing
and performance than DX 12 but so many
people seem to prefer the different
graphics API that we decided to just
move to it for CP testing even though
the frame time performance is
technically worse hitman 2 showed a
reassuringly strong preference for SMT
on rather than off with a 7.9 percent
improvement from the extra thread
slightly better than even the 646 thread
stock 9600 K our testing with the 8 core
16 thread 9900 K showed much better
results with hyper threading disabled
across multiple tests and retests and 16
threads doesn't exceeding some threshold
because the 8 core 16 thread 3.9 Giga at
1700 our performance the 6 core 12
thread 3.9 gigahertz 1600 so it must be
down to hitman 2 treats thread count the
4.3 gigahertz our overclock on the 3600
was as disappointing as it was in the
other gaming tests or most of them
leaving hitman two is universally bad
your apartment low is unaffected for
this CPU you're really getting so much
out of the stock performance that a
higher power consuming OC is getting
tough to argue in the games the r5 3600
out-of-box performance is highly
competitive with Intel similarly priced
CPUs already included in games and a big
leap over the previous two generations
by AMD the 1440p results stack up the
same way as the 1080p results did 9600
KOC is better than the 3600 OC but by a
smaller than usual margin 3,600 stock
just barely better than the AI 600 K
stock and the 3600 1000 T disabled
Tralee and well behind the normal six
core while thread result we can get into
the production workloads next including
Adobe Photoshop Premiere blender v-ray
GCC canoe compiler collection and some
additional testing so our gue new
compiler collection benchmark is
basically a cache benchmark something
that's Illustrated clearly by this chart
this demonstrates how quickly the CPU
completes our code compiled in the
benchmarking it is not however
benchmarking the compilers against each
other nor is it testing the
compiled quality the faster and higher
core count CPUs and especially Intel
CPUs would do better in other code
compile environments potentially but
something compiling GCC with GCC is as
Wendell of level one text told us quote
cache hits all the way down in this
respect we can functionally use this
test as an illustration of the impact of
having so much l3 cache by all counts
the overclocked 2700 X should clearly
win against an r5 3600 and pretty much
every other test if you happen to work
in a similar environment to this
basically cygwin or mingw compiling on
Windows the higher cache will help we
may have accidentally discovered Andy's
new favorite benchmark as one of our
patreon subscribers noted and it's
functionally a look at the cache so a
bit of a unique test but not one that
necessarily scales to the way most
people would compile the code we need to
look into expanding this testing going
forward moving on to the next one our
next benchmarks are for compression
decompression with 7-zip with
compression the r5 3600 pushes 55,000
that million instructions per second or
55,000 MIPS ranking it between the 1,700
at 3.9 gigahertz and 9700 K a 5.1
gigahertz the bigger story here is that
a 3,600 at 4.3 gigahertz all core
performs about where a 5.1 9700 K does
and not distant from the 2,700 X dot CPU
generationally we see an improvement of
27 percent over the twenty six hundred
and forty six percent over the r5 1600
cpus decompression is next in this test
the r5 3600 pushed of 72,000 MIPS
roughly tying it with a 9700 K a 5.1
gigahertz and holding a strong lead over
the price comparative 9600 K which isn't
even in consideration at this point
Adobe Photoshop is next like premiere
Photoshop refers frequency first
performing transforms warps applying
filters color changes and resizes we see
the 9900 K illustrate what Photoshop
likes in a processor the 9700 Kay's 5.1
gigahertz result being so close to the
nine nine hundred KS 5.1 karakurt's
result is useful for demonstrating that
frequency matters first for photoshop
the r5 3600 ends up nearly tied with the
i5 9600 k stock cpu leading it by about
two percent overclocking the r5 3600
gets it to 979 points an improvement of
just 2.3 percent
the 9600 K with an overclock despite 13%
from 942 points to 1065 points and these
are five can hold its own here but
frequency dependence and Photoshop does
shift the recommendation to be less
strongly towards the r5 3600 blender
2.79 is next this is a real application
for 3d modeling and animation and is the
very one we used for our own GN intro
animation these videos and for designing
a lot of the GM products on stored I
Kara's excess net the GN monkeyhead
render gives CPUs a mixed about heavy
workload to crunch for this one the r5
3600 stock cpu finishes in twenty four
point eight minutes ranking it as faster
than the 8700 K and just under a minute
slower than the five point one gigahertz
9700 K blender has an organic use for
the hike or count on a.m. these
mainstream CPUs and doesn't lean as
heavily on frequency though it obviously
still matters generationally the 3600
finishes the render faster than the 2631
minute result by 20% with the 1635
minute results reduced by 30% on the
3600 the 3600 completes the render
significantly faster than intel
similarly positioned to 9600 case stock
and overclocked results overclocked in
the 3600 ties it with the r7 1700 at 3.9
gigahertz illustrating that Andy has
brought $330 performance from 2017 to
the $200 price class in 2019 but also
highlighting that a used processor in
the r7 class may be a good consideration
if you can get it for cheaper like maybe
the 2700 the GM logo is a heavier
workload not much changes but the 9700
km 5.1 guardsman was up the ranks more
than earlier meeting the 2,700 X the r5
3600 is close to both of these one stock
and an overclock gets at only a time
reduction of 4.2% not much from the
limited OC Headroom in this one our
Adobe premier benchmarks are next using
a 1080p show report project that we can
hopefully show on the screen with a roll
and b-roll followed by a 4k project
that's heavily comprised of b-roll shots
we're rendering without Vig P in the
case of Intel so there would be some
potential performance uplift if I GPUs
is acceptable in your organization and
workflow the 1080p show report renders
in 4.8 minutes on the AMD r5 3600 as
discussed in the past Premiere and
Photoshop are still heavily
frequency-dependent
but the 3600 does well to reduce render
time versus the stock are 526 hundreds
5.9 minute results and 18% decrease in
render time stocks
and generationally is a major lift where
AMD needed it and he has been weak in
Adobe Photoshop and Premiere previously
so the IPC and clock increase help here
for reference in overclocks 2600
rendered the file in five point five
minutes with the 1600 stock CPU from
2017 rendering it in six point seven
minutes making the 3,600 about twenty
eight percent last time intensive
compared to the i5 9600 K a processor
with comparatively fewer threads and
these are five thirty six hundred
finally begins to ball ahead in one of
Andy's weakest realistic production
workloads Intel stock 9600 K and it's
five point six minute results it closer
to the r5 2600 at four point eight
gigahertz overclocking the Intel CPU to
five point one it ends up about tied
with the 3600 the 3600 finishes in about
the same amount of time as the 3.9
gigahertz 700 from a few years ago
basically a 1700 x4 reference there are
more or less the same when overclocked
and not far behind the Sutton 9700 K the
4k renders I have your workload for this
one the I 999 hundred K predictably
chart topside eleven point nine minutes
stock more relevant to our conversation
today the 3600 finishes the render in
fourteen point two minutes allowing the
more expensive and I do 900 K a time
requirement reduction of 16 percent when
both our stock the r5 3600 our
performance of stock 9600 K with an 18%
time reduction pretty massive and
further manages to push a 7% lead or
less time required than the overclocked
at 9600 K generationally the r5 3600
stock CPU our performs the stock 2600
CPS 18 minute result by about 20 percent
or about 28 percent shorter time than
the r5 1619 point eight minute result
finally an overclock on the r5 3600
allows us to finish in about three
percent last time let me stock 3600 dra
is the last production test for us it's
by Kaos group and one that workstation
users have requested this one measures
in render time by minutes so lower is
again better the r5 3600 CPU finishes
the v-ray benchmark render in about 1.45
minutes landing it near an i7 8700 K
stock were under time and ahead of the
1.5 for a minute
r5 2600 4.2 gigahertz render time
generationally the 3600 stock CPU
completes the rendered in 16% less time
than the 2600 stock CPUs 1.7 30-minute
render or about 26 percent faster than
the r5 1600 stock CPU the r5 3600
finishes the rendered about 23% less
time and the in tile 9600 K
stating that v-ray does actually utilize
the threads overclocking the 9600 K
closes the gap ranking it at one point
six minutes but it's not enough the 3600
with an overclock is near the 1700 I
want 3.9 gigahertz and overclocking the
r7 2700 would get you to about the r7
2700 X levels of performance or 1.25
minutes this again shows you that there
may be even better value in buying an
older 2700 CPU on clearance and
overclocking it at least there would be
for some workloads like this one power
consumption testing is measured at the
EPS 12-volt rails before vrm efficiency
losses but after the wall this is a much
more accurate measurement than the wall
and gives us a fairly direct read on CPU
power consumption without all the
variability and noise of the rest of the
system the a.m. the r5 3600 measured at
79 watts on the stock gigabyte
motherboard with no overclock supplied
our 3600 silicon is much worse than our
3900 X 3700 X silicon so the overclocked
requires 1.43 volts to hold 4.3
gigahertz all core this lands us at 90
watts down the EPS 12-volt rails with
all power limits manually disabled this
is the only chart that will contain the
r7 + r9 data for our 3600 review but
briefly the r7 3700 X stock CPU consumes
about 87 watts when stock and 103 watts
when overclocked 4.3 gigahertz at one
point 3 5 volts
note that our voltage required here goes
down one full step from the 3600 but
core count has gone up this is a silicon
quality advantage and that carries to
the 3900 X our 3900 acts could
impressively hold 4.3 gigahertz all core
across 12 cores
at just one point three four volts this
is really good this and that's a 170
watt power consumption but more
importantly we're able to run both the
3700 X and 3900 x with a lower power
consumption and lightly threaded
workloads that in stock or auto with the
motherboard the motherboard pushes
higher voltage than the CPUs need and so
we can clock higher with lower voltage
and power requirements and therefore
heat requirements when working manually
will talk about this more nor 3700 ax +
3900 X reviews hitman 2 quickly gives us
another look at power for this one the
3600 stock CPU stays within Andes
defined spec of 65 watt TDP noting that
TDP on a processor box is slightly
different than actual power through the
socket but not by much we were outside
of spec and blender but within spec for
a more lightly threaded gaming work
the 3,600 measure depth of 52 watts
overclocking pushed us 256 and the 3900
ex ran at 76 watts when stock is 72 and
overclocked that's not variance that's
not margin of error that's about testing
error that's because we were able to
pull lower voltage than the stock
motherboard BIOS assigns by manually
tuning it but still pull higher
frequency conclusions then this is
actually pretty fun processor Patrick
did a lot of the testing on this and
wrote half of the script so we I wrote
the production section he wrote the
gaming section and we've both come to
the conclusion that we feel good about
the r5 3600 this is a processor that we
can confidently recommend it is more or
less superior in all ways to competing
Intel i5 parts now technically the i5
9600 K does perform a bit better on
average in gaming scenarios you can also
overclock it further so if you count
overclock to overclock performance yeah
it's in the lead but the problem we have
with the i-5 now is the same one we've
had with the i-5 for the last two years
which is that they are much harder to
defend at a purchase than say an i9 or
an i7 high-end CPU a couple like they
did some hundred K a couple years ago
and the reason for that is because
threads are artificially turned off on
these on the 9600 K and it has now
gotten to a point that was some of the
benchmarks we've done in the past and
even recently frame time consistency is
just not as reliable on those Intel six
core parts as it used to be so
interestingly as a separate conversation
for those of you who've been in the
industry long enough and it's only been
maybe eight years since this was
relevant
you might remember when people pretty
much everywhere said an i5 is not for
gaming and I said that too many years
ago so we're now in a scenario where an
i5 isn't enough for gaming for Intel but
and our v is enough for gaming from an
vo is something we'll talk about more in
our our 737 hundred extra view so r5
3600 is genuinely good it is highly
competitive we can strongly recommend it
and versus the 9600 K in general we
would prefer the 3600 and that's because
frame time consistency is reliable we
know it's almost always going to be good
and if it's not there's probably some
other problem with the software we know
that it is versatile and not everyone
needs the versatility so this is
something we
recommend as a strong point because 3900
ex versatility is irrelevant if you
aren't going to actually use it so if
you're only gaming that's a different
story but for the r5 3600 having strong
enough gaming performance plus the
versatility it just becomes an add-on
feature so that's something that's good
the value is good it's $200 so that
makes it cheaper than the 9600 K making
it easier to purchase or defend the
purchase of and we would recommend
getting a cooler with it as we do with
most CPUs but technically you get one in
the box so that is most of the
36-hundred conclusion a couple of
interesting notes here AMD has become
AMD's biggest competition now with these
CPUs so for a video maker with a
stricter budget the r5 3600 is superior
to its immediately price matched
competition from Intel you may be better
served though by purchasing an R 7 2700
on steep sale and overclocking it for
perspective if you did our benchmarking
that land you had our overclocks 2700 X
results of four point three minutes for
1080p premiere and that would cost about
$200 but that inventory will stop being
made at some point if not already even
of the 200 to 250 dollar range there's
no point in buying a 9600 k if premiere
will be part of your regular activities
or any rendering software that can make
use of more than six cores like blender
will be doing streaming benchmarks that
later as part of our ongoing rise in
3000 coverage but for now we can at
least say that the 3600 is the better
choice for those who plan to edit and
render footage if AMD is its own biggest
competition then they've done a great
job on the gaming side of
differentiating the 3600 from the 2600
the 1600 excuse or otherwise there are
significant generational improvements
over the other six core twelve thread
parts with clocks being pushed closer to
the max out of box there's still freedom
to overclock but there's a less and less
point to pushing in an all core OC on
AMD parts at room temperature we're
hoping for better results from PBR
precision boost overdrive so stay tuned
for that the i5 9600 K outperforms the
3600 and most of our game benchmarks as
games have been slow to adapt to CPUs
with more than eight threads and the 5
gigahertz overclocking potential the
9600 K makes it an even clearer winner
for exclusively gaming but the r5 3600
is again more versatile
cheaper the big question is whether the
$250 or five of 3600 ex that Andy is
also coming out with can justify its $50
price point because the 3600 you can
just overclock it on average to about
the same point then that's probably the
better solution but they'll be close
enough so this is a scenario now where
for the most part we're recommending
picking between a 3600 and it all or
2700 for about the same price and
overclock either one of them or don't
there the 3600 pretty good out of box
the 2700 definitely deserves an
overclock view by the non ex though so
yeah those are your considerations go
look at the old AMD stock first it's
good and a lot of it is anyway not all
of it but pretty good and competitive
and price and with Andy's new stuff and
if you're on less of a budget or you
just want the newest thing the 3600 is
something we can recommend without any
concern so that'll be it for this one
check back for our r9 3900 ex review
that'll be a heated battle versus the I
$9.99 hundred K and you can check back
for a 3700 ax review after that we also
have a teardown of the 5700 XT coming up
today and a review of the 5700 XT coming
up today so that'll be it for this one
