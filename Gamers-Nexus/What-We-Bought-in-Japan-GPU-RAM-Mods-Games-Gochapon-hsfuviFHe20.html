in Asia video we've been in Asia for
about two weeks now I went to Taiwan
first for Computex
and then Japan we got a lot of cool
stuff from well I would say the
tradeshow but actually none of that was
worth our time but we bought some cool
stuff outside of the tradeshow and some
of it is computer hardware so we going
through all this stuff today and
hopefully you'll be testing some of it
once we get back to the States
before that this video is brought to you
by the gamers and axis at two-tone
Raglan hoodies sporting the GN color
scheme and a tear down logo on the back
with a GM logo on the front chest these
are perfect light weight hoodies for
spring or cool summer weather and we've
just restocked them at store doc gamers
Nexus done that or click the link in the
description below so let's go over the
quadrants on the table here first of all
we are in a very tiny apartment in Japan
right now in Tokyo and didn't realize it
was this small so this is our set you're
gonna have to deal with it first thing
we're talking about this was 1640
Japanese yen so it's just under $16 US
and it's a Jones bow part now if you
don't know Jones though they are a very
common case supplier so they actually
supply a lot of the basically finished
products to manufacturers like Rose well
who then sticks their brand on it and
call it their own and Jones bow is more
common here in Japan than I mean we
don't see them anywhere in any any
stateside stores so this is just an LED
heat sink for a memory so you can
convert your ddr4 kit into what Corsair
g.skill and everyone else in the
industry charge a lot of money for it's
bit under 16 bucks for one of them so
yes it's still expensive but basically I
don't know we're gonna try it out just
for fun and see if the digital LED is
any good or not but that's a John's boat
component we also have from Jonesboro a
VF one of this memory kit I think this
is called the NC one if you're
interested in it and not sure if it's
easily available in the States but we
also have the VF one which is a graphics
card cooler so we'll open that one up
next so here's the VF one this is
another John Webb part I think I paid
about thirty four dollars for this u.s.
something around there thirty five
thirty five forty Japanese yen
current conversion rates about 1 USD to
110 japanese yen and this they label as
the actually let me read some of the
text here they label this as a graphics
card radiator which is not factually
inaccurate actually the f1 is a video
card assistant cooling equipment for
gamer developed by Jones BOE team the
sense of the development of this product
is to provide a straight blown air
supplement for sounds like a medical
device for those video card which do not
have sufficient heat dissipation or
inappropriate cooling channels by an
appropriate case structure which will
cause high video card temperature high
noise level with VF 1 Jones bow team has
tested that the temperature of the video
card will drop around 5 degrees Celsius
that's much more modest marketing
language than most the companies work
with different figures will be achieved
from different hardware finally they
state there is RGB light effect on the
top of the VF 1 it can not only
supplement the insufficient light effect
most video cards throwing some shade but
also provide simple and elegant light
effect embellishment to the video guard
area this sounds like the best thing
I've ever purchased especially because
they're casting shade at the max the
video card ad on board partners saying
that they don't develop sufficient LEDs
please do not tell them that drones but
we have had enough RGB LEDs for a week
so this is the VF one I'm actually very
interested to test this one once we get
back home as stated it's a bit over 30
bucks
and I'm gonna be honest I'm not entirely
sure how this one's supposed to mount
but I would assume it hopefully comes
with something for vrm cooling or
contact otherwise it looks like a
brushed aluminum plate on this side and
then just three fans so I don't know
we'll see how it goes
might come with some additional parts
before nope adjust cables for LEDs so
we'll see how that goes not really sure
to be honest next thing we got so let's
go through some non computer hardware
items one of the most fun things that we
did in Japan was this game which I'm
gonna sangoku San Goku she Tyson is
sorts of card game it's actually really
cool we have some b-roll of it and
I have magic cards in here - it's ignore
those so these cards we went to an
arcade and I I wish we knew more about
the guy but there was a guy a local
there playing and we bugged him and
asked him to show us how to play and
it's very kind to do so and even gave us
a card that I assume is no good so you
put the cards on the table
and basically it's all NFC enabled so
you just move the cards around we've got
footage of it to do more or less a card
based RTS system in arcade format so you
take one of these cards put on the
machine allows you to play then you take
your different armies or character cards
heroes armies so forth it was all in
Japanese but it's a game and there's
more or less able to understand the
extremely excruciatingly multi lawn
tutorial but in the top left of each
card there are symbols like elephant for
I think potentially seed there are
horses which are literally just
horseback units archers for ranged units
sword Spears so forth and it's typical
soft and hard counter stuff like you see
in any RTS game except all the units are
controlled with NFC cards on top of a
physical board so you just move them
around based on where you're trying to
move on the map which is on the other
screen in the S fashion so it's actually
it was a really fun game even though you
don't really even need to speak or read
any Japanese I think to figure it out
and enjoy it and if we had more time
here I'd play it but so yeah we played
that one that was a lot of fun if anyone
knows that I'd be curious to hear more
about it I think it's got some kind of
mana based system as well based on the
bottom-left of the cards and speaking of
mana based systems we also picked up a
couple of just out it for me out of
nostalgia picked up a couple of magic
packs so we got masters 25 and I've been
out of the game for quite a while but
ended up just getting a local Japanese
language booster pack basically and I
think we picked up two of those picked
up these sangoku cards that we played
with at the arcade that was at the Sega
arcade by the way really cool place
they're like five or six stories some of
these arcades another item so these were
extremely popular here and in Taiwan
this is a from a gotcha pond machine and
basically they just
our a more controlled form of gambling
and that you're guaranteed to get
something but it is somewhat randomized
so Pokemon of course very popular still
got a couple of Snorlax and out of the
ones that I dumped money into you and
then I think we have plenty of other
ones here this was probably the coolest
thing we got Keegan got this one out of
a Gacha pong ball but basically this
comes disassembled as just a jumble of
parts and you assemble it pretty
straightforward and get a Gundam out of
it for prospective a lot of these things
cost between 200 and 300 Japanese yen in
that range some of them are up to 500
like I think this one was about 500 so
that's anywhere from 3 to 5 bucks to at
the low end for some of the Pokemon
items we got a couple other ones - I
have a Kirby figure I have a hamster
that goes on a coffee cup from Taiwan
Diglett Pokemon we got a lot of them
anyway it's kind of fun I guess but
they're also really popular crane games
here and in Taiwan the way they worked
is you have pretty bad odds so it'd be
like one coin to play and very low
chance of winning even if you grab the
thing because once it grabs it the claw
will roll some dice and decide if it's
gonna actually hold on to it even if you
grabbed it and a lot of the time it
drops it however Ryan who is with us
did it happen to win this which we've
named creep at you or peep at you
because it spent the last two weeks
hanging from various ceilings and two
windows and mirrors and things like that
in spy positions so that Pikachu's been
with us for a while now and it's going
all the way back home so this is another
one of the more interesting items this
one is one that Keegan got as well he
got all the Gundam stuff I don't know
much about Gundam but this is a turn a
Gundam it's a model from and it comes
partly pre-painted as with most models
you pull the parts off of the sprue and
then assemble it so this was 1280
Japanese yen it's about $12 u.s. pretty
cool fine the store with this stuff was
insane by the way first of all plays the
same song on loop constantly and
brainwashes you and then on floor two
there's a bunch of PC hardware which is
where
check out this Jones post off on floor
six is basically the giant toy store
which has two entire rows dedicated to
Gundam so we had to drag Keegan out for
his own good and then there's also tons
of shelves dedicated to Pokemon Nintendo
characters Gacha pond all kinds of stuff
it'd be it'd be easy to spend a lot of
money that was an Akihabara which you've
probably heard of so pretty cool stuff
coming out of there this one is
different and very cool so this is from
EVGA CEO personally who gave it to us
after we did a tour of his audio setup
we're working on a video of that he's
got a really impressive audio setup like
it's I mean there are pieces of
equipment in the audio room that are a
hundred years old basically so we're
working on a video of it explaining how
all that works and showing the setup
it's it's extremely impressive but this
is a Western electric sound system
plaque Western Electric is actually one
of the oldest and at one point most
powerful companies that has ever existed
in terms of modern sound and actually
one of the most powerful companies
period when they were at their height so
Western Electric became so big that
they're broken up as a monopoly they
supplied military radio devices their
date back to 1830 or even before then
but some of the first products that
really gained traction were 1830 and
Western Electric worked on things like
the horns that you'll see in some of our
b-roll so those are just giant basically
four speakers they put a tweeter and a
driver horn and a subwoofer so they
worked on that they worked on theater
systems they worked on projectors they
worked on Telegraph's and telephones and
all that stuff and they were eventually
broken up as a monopoly I think became
just Eastern Electric and maybe north
electric or something like that not much
left of them these days but that's a
plaque from one of the devices that he
purchased where a sound system we'll be
talking about that more soon
pretty cool put it on the set wall and I
think other that's just a neat piece of
technology history though other stuff we
got picked this up in Taiwan so these
are definitely legitimate definitely
licensed keychains for
and the flash as gifts for home and on
the back it's got definitely licensed
high-resolution images of each of them
they went as far as to put copyrights on
there for DC Comics and Marvel really
not sure why we also saw some other
things that were not Avengers that were
branded as Avengers either way that this
was in the Shilin night market in Taiwan
it's a really cool place if you haven't
been it's crazy it's just a lot of stuff
basically but kind of fun to walk around
if you can get dropped off in the right
place by the cab it's huge though so
yeah small items kind of mixed quality
on them but they were cheap so we we
talked to I talked to the guy and he
wanted something like I want to say 250
for two of them 250 Taiwan dollars as
about 1 234 NTD to us so you can kind of
haggle down though in the night markets
kind of part of the part of the fun this
is from Japan so we were told this is
pretty good I'm not sure I believe it
but for coffee drinkers I guess it's
Nescafe and I don't think we know why
it's supposed to be good but someone at
home told us it's good and said to bring
back some so that's what we're doing but
if you've heard of it I guess let us
know why it's supposedly good it's it's
semi pre-ground coffee that we found
here in Japan the next item the let's go
with the solar bug so you'll see this
video soon if you haven't already
probably have already by now so Solar
bug is something that I are actually was
purchased for me by Sasha our tour guide
in Taiwan Sasha was awesome he's
featured in the awards video as well
received the final award and the most
important one and this is just a solar
power I mean shine a light on it and it
walks that's all it does it was in one
of the markets though is in a Guan hua
digital Plaza so that was just kind of a
cool pick up for a couple blocks and
then this one is the transforming with
transformers text and it's also a solar
robot except it transforms into a t-rex
a robot a drill machine or a rhino
beetle and just thought that would be
fun debris
oh so some more tech items that we're
gonna be testing this is from Aki Aki
Habra also this is just a set of heat
sinks I liked it because they were about
MOSFET sized so we can stick a bunch of
them on a video card for mousepad
cooling and very targeted areas and also
they're purple and blue but I think they
are probably anodized aluminum it's not
gonna be as effective as pure copper or
something like that but it'll still be
fine it stills 205 watts per meter
Kelvin at 25 degree Celsius so better
than most things and then this is just
some Sanwa supply they're all paste
which was about $5 they claim that it is
2 grams of 6.5 watts per meter Kelvin
thermal paste basically just wanted to
buy it because it was relatively
affordable and wanted to see how it
performs against on the name-brand stuff
that we have in the states this is a
Japanese craftsman spirit brand part so
there were a lot of these in the market
that we were in in Akihabara and this
was a about 16 bucks
it's an m2 SSD heat spreader and heat
sink and as we've seen in the past those
have questionable performance at times
but I think this one will perform better
than some of the motherboard ones so we
wanted to buy it and try it out comes
with a thermal pad and a heatsink for
the SSDs as always you really just want
to cool the controller in there not the
flash but we'll give it a shot anyway
couple more things here a Dragonball
from a gumball vending machine a
pokeball that's in stress ball format a
small Lego thing these are all gotcha
pond machine things so just kind of fun
to sink money into when you need to get
rid of coins because there's a lot of
that here these are our cookies from our
favorite bakery in Taiwan I don't know
the name of it it's a bakery and it's in
Taiwan it's near a Roma cafe
if you live there check it out it's
across the street I'm tell them we sent
you they won't know who we are
so those are really good though so I'm
bringing those back this is Pocari sweat
so this saved me last year when I
started feeling very bad after we landed
and it's basically like a Gatorade
equivalent with an awful name because
it's but it's got the word sweat and it
they call it anion supply drink but it
it takes a bit of accommodating to get
or it
get bit of getting used to but it's an
okay drink overall kind of like Gatorade
Pocari sweat we knew about because they
sponsored a bunch of broodwar teams back
in the day so if you know Starcraft
that's where we first heard of it and
then we also Keegan he picked up this
he's he's got a taste for Asian alcohol
I guess what is this paint the paint in
it okay this is Taiwanese equivalent of
Baiju okay so it's it's paint thinner
that I'm is a Taiwanese equivalent of by
Geo and last year Keegan was gifted from
one of our tour guides it was just a he
was a tour guide actually two years ago
tour guide in China not affiliated
directly with any of the companies who
work with he is a runs a factory that
makes a bunch of electronic parts for
companies that we work with and he was
giving us a tour he bought I guess paint
thinner for Keegan at the time and so
Keegan's not replacing that what is the
how much was this this is 800 Taiwan or
Japanese NTD 800 MTD for that one and
that's so one 230 if you want to convert
it and then this one is showed you
showed you showed you what is showed you
add distilled Chinese white rice wine
distilled Chinese rice wine apparently
for this one so we're gonna bring those
back and I'm gonna bring back Pocari
sweat that tells you about everything
hits now everything else I think we've
gone over all the cool stuff so as
always I would say links in the
description below but the probably won't
be any just subscribe for more content
go back and check our Computex stuff if
you missed it
this is the last thing we're shooting
here in Asia we'll be back we've been
gone for about two weeks now so yeah
we're done
well we'll be working back a normal
