dotnet and we're reviewing am these new
r9 380 x video card which ships and only
one variety and that is four gigabytes
so no 2 gigabyte 4 gigabyte stuff here
it is only 4 gigabytes and the 380 x is
priced about where you'd expect it it's
above the 380 in the vertical landing at
two hundred thirty dollars MSRP with
several the board partners shipping
their 380 X's pre overclocked at about
240 to 250 dollars so you've got a ten
to twenty dollar price disparity in
there depending on which aib you're
looking at or add in board partner and
the card has pretty familiar specs
because it's still running the same
architecture as found on the previous r9
300 series cards like the r9 380 still
on Hawaii which was on the older 200
series cards as well at least some of
them like the 290x and the specs overall
are familiar so here's a specs chart
that'll show some of those but the core
items to look at are of course the
engine clock also called the core clock
stock the card ships at 970 megahertz
but our model which is a sapphire nitro
r9 380 x ships at 10 40 megahertz with a
couple of other changes to the memory
clock and things like that if we look at
more of the stock specs you'll see that
it is strictly 4 gigabytes as I
mentioned and the 380 x has 2048 stream
processors if you're curious for the 380
had you can see it in a chart next to
the 380 x here and the three idx has a
rated TDP of about 190 wats that we did
our own internally validated GN official
full power consumption test and have
charged for that later on in this video
there are 26 pin headers required for
connection on the 380 x that we have of
course with non reference designs or
super overclocking cards they may add a
pin or 2 48 + 6 pin normally for some of
the overclocking cards and then the aib
is that important partners are offering
380 x overclocked cards for about ten
dollars more with the core clock at ten
40 ish megahertz in the case of ours and
the memory
at about 1500 megahertz versus the 14 25
megahertz gddr5 memory clock stock
setting for the three ATX the rest of
the specs as shown in the table are all
pretty standard for a device of the r9
380 x is positioning within the vertical
and you can check the charts on the
website or some of them in this video
for comparison against the existing 389
x video cards and e is clearly targeting
nvidia's gtx 960 here as its primary
competition go head-to-head with and
that would include the primary model the
4 gigabyte gtx 960 priced at almost the
same as the 380 x about to 32 to 40 with
some rebate give and take if you even
count those but generally to 30 to 40
and the gtx 960 two gigabyte ships
closer to two hundred dollars so there
is that model as well but as we just
showed in our Assassin's Creed syndicate
test the two gigabyte vs. 4 gigabyte
models can actually have a pretty large
performance disparity between them
depending on what game you're playing
and you can search our channel for more
information on that for or just hit the
Assassin's Creed syndicate article at
the top of the website MD is pushing
Direct X 12 support pretty hard because
it is actually in some games like ashes
of singularity which to be fair is a
little bit and the favored by the
developers in some games MV is showing a
decent lead with DirectX 12 against
Nvidia and that is largely due to the
way their architecture is designed so
that doesn't mean that there can't be an
nvidia lead it just means that as of now
in the very early stages of the x 12
with one or two games that exists with
it there is somewhat of an advantage for
AMD finally where it generally sees a
disadvantage with its dx11 optimization
and drivers and the architecture sort of
struggling without a little bit of extra
help so to the end of this dx12 support
andy is very big on pushing the fact
that as dx12 comes along cards like the
r9 380 x are much better at tessellation
than the older and the cards were and
this is definitely worth noting because
Andy does regularly get beat out in
tessellation by n video which is pretty
good at it that's why Nvidia does
some of their technologies and game
works with tessellation not necessarily
to spite AMD I'm not saying that but
because nvidia is good at tessellation
they know that and they leverage it for
things like hair works or some of their
other effects that we've talked about in
the past aside from tessellation Andy is
also pushing the fact that the dynamic
usage of vram for tiled resources like
tiled textures particularly allows for a
higher virtual resolution of texture
files so you can get a general higher
quality output in the game assuming the
developers build for it because it
doesn't matter what the GPU supports if
developers don't build for it but the
tiling is another feature that Andy is
promoting as hey this is something that
will work on the 380 x we're supporting
it and we think we're good at it so
that's kind of where they're coming at
from a marketing angle and the other big
items to look at are just going to be
general performance and how does the TDP
stack up against the previous cards
which ran very hot if you remember the
200 series and things like that so we're
going to look at all that now before
diving into the FPS benchmarks a quick
note that is important we are in the
process of merging two of our GPU
benches into one and that means that we
have some z97 benchmarks that we
conducted in some x99 the reason we're
including both of them here unlike
normally is because the x99 platform did
have some newer games benched the
including battlefront fallout and things
like that so we wanted to include as
many of those new games as possible and
get the 380 x benched on those as well
now when I had 380 the 390 and the fury
X we had all those cards on loans so
when you're looking at that data it is
using older drivers the important note
but for some of the games like metro and
grid and those types of older games GTA
even there haven't really been any
driver optimization since launch the z97
and x 99 charts are pretty thoroughly
explained on the website but i'll try
and mention which one was used here in
general you're still looking at a 960
versus 380 x benchmark there's some
comparative 380 benchmarking if it was a
game for which we had
III 18 on X card let's first look at the
thermal and power charts these were
created using our z97 platform which has
been running our thermal test for quite
a while now and allows for comparison to
the r9 380 398 fury x and many of the
nvidia cards including the competing 960
and this shows thermal data first that
the r9 380 x nitro which is the sapphire
card using the sapphire cooler and all
of that landed at roughly 53 celsius
average delta T over ambient compared
against the 45 c or so of the 380 nitro
and both of these were nitro cards which
is great because that means it is
somewhat of a more linear comparison
than cross brand cards the 380 does
primarily host a lower clock of 10 10
megahertz versus the 1040 of the 380 x
so that certainly contributes to the
heat which you can see in our 380 OC
benchmarks as well but if we look to
power consumption that gives a bit of a
look at the full peak system load on the
z97 platform plus the 380 x so this is
peak load whole system not just the GPU
we see the 380 x consuming about 300
point 8 watts of power and that's about
40 watts more than the r9 380 about 30
watts more than the overclocked r9 380
and about 85 watts more pretty big than
the gtx 960 GPU that we've tested and
that's the most immediate contender the
r9 390 sits at around 341 wats just for
a comparison of something out a bit
higher tier of a structure in the
vertical getting to the FPS tests let's
start with call of duty black ops 3 just
because it's a newer title this test was
conducted on our z97 platform but the r9
380 and r9 390 are not present here
because they were on loan and we didn't
have them for this test you'll see more
of those in the following benchmarks in
black ops 3 the r9 380 x performs at an
admirable 66 FPS average those struggles
a bit on the one percent and 0.1 percent
lows the frame times as we call them the
66 FPS average plants the 380 x just
under the gtx 960 4 gigabyte card and
over the gtx 960 two gigabyte card
though both 960 s do have superior one
percent low metrics there's a bit of a
gain for the 380 x on average over the
960 two gigabyte card the 9 64 gigabyte
beats the r9 380 x by three percent with
380 x beating the 960 two gigabyte by
also three percent so hopefully that's
not too confusing if you just look at
the table here moving on to the 1440p
resolution black ops 3 tests the 380 x
falls below the general playable range
landing at 43 FPS average and with an 11
FPS 0.1% low certainly not great to get
1440p playable would require either
tanking the settings pretty hard to a
much lower configuration or just running
a lower resolution really or a
higher-end card with the 1440p
resolution for the 380 x you're
generally stuck at about 1080p at least
in this game unless you want to crash
your settings which isn't worth it in my
opinion you're better off going to
another card let's look at some charts
that show the r9 380 and r9 390 for
better vertical comparison these are on
our z97 platform also the witcher 3 is
still new and a GPU intensive games that
makes for perfect comparison for an x
benchmark and at 1080p with hair works
disabled anti-aliasing completely
disabled and ambient occlusion set to
SSAO for fairness the 380 x lands at 38
FPS just above the r9 285 and r9 380
both of which are at 36 FPS that's a 2
FPS gap the gtx 960 cards both hit 34
FPS and are effectively identical to
each other in performance and this has
them beaten by the 380 x by about five
point four percent at 1080p and we'd
have to move to something more like
medium or high for better playability
granted because even at the frame rate
we're at right now with the 380 x it's
not great but for comparative and
competitive reasons the 380 x is
exceeding the 960 s performance by about
5 perform five point four percent excuse
me with the Nvidia technologies disabled
like hair works and things like that
which would impact the performance of
nvidia as well metro last light is a
long-standing
GPU benchmark and includes nearly all
cards we've ever tested at 1080p with
very high quality and high tessellation
settings the 380 x pushes 58 FPS which
is about a five percent gain over the
389 x and that means the 380 x holds as
you see here about a 10 point nine
percent lead over the gtx 960 tested at
1440p the next resolution as you can see
here the 380 x can push about 40 FPS
average and just barely lands above the
r9 380 and r9 285 effectively identical
cards again this is not really a great
card for higher resolutions than 1080p
but this is sort of where Andy is
targeting the 380 x card it's the gaming
sweet spot so to speak as everyone calls
it these days at 1080p shadow of mordor
puts the r9 380 x at about six point
seven percent over the r9 380 a
reasonable improvement and lands it just
within the 60 FPS ideal performance
range the 380 x is about 9% ahead of the
384 1440p performance so that is a
reasonable gain or delta in the
percentages but would require some
settings tunings to get it more playable
in the ideal 60 FPS range because it is
a bit lower than that with 1440p let's
look at something new Assassin's Creed
syndicate doesn't include the 380 and
390 in our benchmarks but it does show
some modern-day lineup performance of
Nvidia and AMD GPUs in opposition with
one another at 1080p with our ultra
custom settings to find an hour separate
Assassin's Creed syndicate benchmark
video and article the r9 380 x pushes 54
FPS against the gtx 960 s 53 FPS and if
we look at the 4 gigabyte 960 that's
about a 1.8 percent gain so negligible
against the 2 gigabyte 960 however there
is a much bigger gap of about eighteen
percent and that gap between the 2 960 s
just strictly between them is sixteen
percent and is in line with previous
Assassin's Creed games which seems to
accentuate the two gigabyte vs. 4
gigabyte mid-range GPU disparity so a
much bigger gap there for more
benchmarks including the new battlefront
game grid GTA
check gamers Nexus dotnet for additional
charts and analysis looking at
overclocking the r9 380 x is fairly easy
to overclock and limited right now given
that we didn't have proper voltage
controls at launch here's a table
showing our stepping of the overclocking
over a test period so you can see our
trial failure and successes with the
clock rate and so forth we ended up with
an 85 megahertz core clock offset
yielding and 11 25 megahertz engine
clock and 50 megahertz memory offset
yielding a 1550 megahertz memory clock
the power offset was maxed to twenty
percent which provided stability
throughout our short term and endurance
tests with these finalized settings this
means we can overclock only about seven
percent on and these are 93 ATX or the
sapphire version anyway which is pre
overclocked and we see around a five to
eight percent performance gain shown
here in these overclock charts for the
witcher 3 metro last light and shadow of
mordor all of which have overclocked in
non overclocks benchmarks shown in the
charts this makes overclocking hardly
worth it but that's been true since the
previous 300 series launches for andy
and really the fury x2 for that matter
and the board partner cards are already
pushing up against their stable limits
with the architecture provided and the
fury x which is all done by AMD
basically is also against its limit so
not a whole lot of room for overclocking
right now alright so that's enough of
that let's get into the conclusion here
and talk about value the r9 380 x is
priced effectively identically to the
gtx 960 and depending on which 960
you're looking at and which game you're
looking at like Assassin's Creed the
disparity between the two gigabyte model
and the 4 gigabyte 380 x is quite large
and that's true for the four gig verse 2
Giga 960 is also one of the biggest
performance gaps we saw was in GTA 5
which held about a 13-percent advantage
for the 380 x over the four gigabyte 960
and we also saw a gain for the 380 axon
metro last light about 10-ish percent
for the 380 x 1st 2 960 as well and when
you look at games like black ops you see
that there is a bit of trade between the
two cards
916 the 380 because the 4 gigabyte 960
has a couple FPS hold over the 380 x so
they do trade blows depend on which game
you're testing and that's pretty
standard for cards of about this price
range the 380 x is a fierce competitor
at this price point it deals a hearty
blow to nvidia's gtx 960 stronghold at
its current 230 ish dollar price point
of the four gigabyte range and that
makes andy a worthwhile look when you're
buying a card of about this price the
380 x does hold a pretty substantial
lead in some games like GTA 5 where
there's a 13-percent delta and in other
games metro there's a good bit of a lead
some games it's down to maybe five
percent or even less one-point-eight
percent in the case of a few of the
titles we tested so ultimately as always
depends on what game you're trying to
play but I would feel comfortable
recommending either the 960 or the 380 x
at this point which is not something
I've said of Andy in recent attempts in
the past and that's been because of
drivers so with the iteration of AMD's
drivers over the past couple months the
past five or so months in particular I
have seen a lot of improved stability
the team that is working at gamers Nexus
has had a lot fewer problems with black
screens and flickering and crashing and
things like that so the drivers have
gotten a lot more stable they've matured
a lot and the new Radeon software is
hopefully something that will continue
and these software related efforts
because it's not out yet but it does
look like a step in the right direction
for usability and sort of pushing users
to the point where they can actually
access the software with some level of
certainty what they're doing rather than
going through catalyst control center
which although not bad is not the most
friendly to some of the newer users and
builders out there the gtx 960 s primary
advantage as always it seems is in
thermals and power draw so it draws
significantly less power about 80 watts
or so than the 380 x and that is
something that nvidia has been good at
for a long time now since the 400 series
which was very hot and their thermals
are solid as well so comes down to how
much do you care about overclocking
because the 960 will be better at the
in general how much do you care about
power draw because again 960 is a bit
better but it does lag behind in some
games thirteen percent GTA 5 and then
you got to look at the overall value
proposition with frame rate I would feel
comfortable recommending both cards 380
x is a very good bye if you're a budget
system builder or if you just don't care
about things like the power draw because
ultimately 80 watts maybe not so much
for some people because you're looking
at pennies ten cents or so per kilowatt
hour but anyway 3dx it's a good buy I'd
do it at the two hundred dollar twenty
thirty dollar price point the 960 has
some advantages primarily in software
support and in its power thermals and
