Plaza we were here last year actually at
Computex 2017 back there's a lot of
really cool stuff here so PC components
home of it's actually better prices then
in the US
tell them it's much worse and then
there's also a lot of small SMDs
lots of test equipment all kinds of
stuff so we're gonna just look around
and see a couple that we have a couple
of objectives today one of them can we
find a GPU at MSRP and if not what's the
closest heartbeat that we can get and
the second objective thing where you
look around for memory 2 is here we can
find for ddr4 prices if we can beat us
price you know typically Taiwan does not
have better prices than in the US just
because the markets smaller but given
the oddity of the market right now
particularly in the US for ddr4 seems
like a good bet to try and look around
to buy and then also finally see we can
find any weird components while we're
here so we're gonna start with a shop
behind me they have a couple of GPUs I'm
just gonna go ask them how much for one
of on point one out and see what it
comes out to and USD before that this
video is brought to you by thermal
grizzlies high-end thermal paste and
liquid metal thermal grizzlies cryo knot
is an affordable high quality thermal
compound that doesn't face some of the
aging limitations of other pastes on the
market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted tests by a tube at the link
in the description below who has a chin
one joke do Xiao Chen 583 90 okay so 391
for rx 588 gigabyte what about
jeka yeah so there's one 1063 gigabyte
here we while we've seen some 1063
gigabytes for like 220 for us and then
there's one here for like two Aiden yeah
285 ish it's about a sixty dollar
difference supposed to be like two
hundred versus 250 really not bad
considering we're in Taiwan for one and
the mine and stuff so I don't know if
that's because mine is starting to wane
a bit and come down and so the prices
are lower but yeah 285 not terrible
considering the baseline for three
gigabytes to 24 it's really not bad rx5
80s kind of rough at like 400 bucks for
an RX 580 and i guess i should ask about
vega 56 as well maybe dou xiao qian gu
Shirley Oh 580 man 580 dollars
okay little Steve okay take a left
that's okay yes yes yes yeah
yeah no Neha
yeah oh sorry live in Taiwan no visiting
visiting yeah come from us us us a video
card
what about what's your cheapest 1066
gigabyte sixty six six
okay okay okay sure yeah why not came in
do you get a lot of mine in here yeah a
lot of people there really yeah more
mining or more gaming more gaming yeah
okay this worried than 9400 okay I need
to see how much in the US okay you said
nine thousand three hundred so two
hundred two hundred eighty five USD yeah
okay 25 USD not that do you have a 5
gigabyte by people yeah okay only China
yeah yeah how much for Vega 56 okay
nineteen thousand okay 33 525 okay it's
a lot man still high yeah yeah just
hopped into shops of GPUs and they're
next to each other
exact same prices so to 84 84 us for
1066 see a bite and 520 5.75 us for Vega
56 and each store so I know all the
places here work with each other someone
compete but either really fierce
competition or they're working together
same prices though nothing too
spectacular yet sadly so we're gonna
look around some more we will find like
a 1063 gateway for a bit cheaper or
something like that
that's a start so far not a lot of luck
so first two shops basically same prices
1060 and Vega 56 no check one more and
see what we can get for a 1050 or 1050
TI or something like that so 1050
supposed to be like a hundred bucks u.s.
780ti supposed to be like 140 150 US but
we'll see ya turn into $87 turn in
eighty eight hundred dollars more than
it should be but okay okay wait so two
hundred eighty-eight dollars let's see
what are they in the US for five seventy
that'd be nice
so rx 570 Amazon is $320 US and it was
280
yes that's like the best one we've seen
so far 320 verse 280 so about 40 dollars
cheaper for an Rx 570 here a gigabyte it
was an msi armor to fan card and that's
a Polaris card Amazon selling the same
card right now for $320 you ask so it's
actually not bad should just bring a
bunch back and sell them so how much is
it flight yeah so we need to do is start
a video card smuggling operation
oh also I asked some of the vendors
what's were popular mining or gaming and
so far everyone said gaming I don't know
if they're just if not but it
sounds like gaming sales more we didn't
see one street vendor that will be in
this video somewhere that had mining
operations so they pre build the mine
set up for you 12 video cards all are x5
80s and 1300 watt power supply and that
was like six grand six thousand dollars
you asked for that so mine is still
pretty popular but anyway
look at a few more
so let's look at like our exes still
like a 1060 or rx 580 or something
what are these brands I don't know they
could be aces could be M aside 392 what
card is that 1066 gear bite yes yeah
1066 gigabyte $392 not retail price
quite quite far from retail price not
even like Taiwan retail price
224 that's really good is this a free
gigabyte so I'm only like $20 too much
really that's pretty good that's good
not to bring home yeah where's the RX
cards 8 gigabyte card or that way but
Thunderbolt so is it is it an external
card I don't know that's an external
card either way that's $603 and of
course the external is the same as
internal only difference is it doesn't
come with a dock or not if it does
that's a bit different
50 they're like no AMD cards here
XG station 1070 TI tonight on API 1070
1080i 1070 1080i where the 1080p is oh
my god
1080i a thousand three dollars rx 470
11,000 so that's gonna be 300 something
that's way too high that should be a
even in Taiwan that should be way
cheaper so okay so we have a shop that's
actually laid out all the prices
vertically which is really nice so I'm
going to go through a couple and we'll
just convert it to USD by dividing by 33
so let's start at I don't know 1080i
1080i armours for MSI 1080i 28 500 by 33
so 863 you it's actually not bad
considering video card prices lately
this is also roughly the same that's
coming around eight hundred sixteen
seventy dollars and that's the gaming
MSI models so let me get about gaming
let's check at 10:50 T I haven't seen
one of those yet 1050 TI 4 gigabyte
gaming MSI 6890 actually you know what
we can go a bit cheaper for gigabyte
non-gaming
I think that's the cheapest one they
have on the board here so that's 60 190
and that is going to be 188 us that's
kind of rough actually that one's not so
great
I'd like to see that about $30 lower but
for Taiwan though keep keep in mind I
think a lot of people think prices here
are way cheaper than the US but the
tacks are not true even when there's not
mining so in fact we found anything
cheaper than the US is pretty surprising
for the 1080 is going to be $636 us
again not terrible should be 500 if
we're at MSRP in the USA but in Taiwan
it's gonna be a bit higher anyway money
gives you a bit of a premium so I don't
know gives you a rough idea 636 for that
one and then let's look
GT that should say GT 1030 not GTX 1030
way up there at the top so GT 10:30 not
GTX 3 gigabyte and don't know what the
model is those really mad at all the
same actually except for ddr4 ones
hopefully that's how it that is 2890 for
that one $87 actually pretty good that's
actually better than the last GT 1030
prices I saw in the US because last time
I checked GT 1030 prices they were
skyrocketing they were like a hundred
bucks u.s. so the fact that this one is
88 it's not bad because I'm started P on
GT 1030 is about 70 bucks I don't know
if it's ddr4 I really doubt it because
it's still brand new but not bad
actually for that price I see a couple
of other things they have here so maybe
we can check some of the CPU prices
let's take a look at those see if those
are any different 7700 k i7 so that's
ten thousand three hundred NTD which
comes out to $312 actually not bad it's
roughly the same as in the u.s. if not a
bit better so really again battle now ng
5632 hundred divided by three that one
is 96 that's kind of the steeper so it's
actually not bad either so what about
ret rise in parts we have no 26-hour
2600 ax right there so 2600 seems $700
that one $203 I must basically what I'm
getting here CPUs are at MSRP even US
MSRP is based to the same prices even
after the fact that the work we're not
in the US other parts is there a
memories you see any memory on the board
okay ddr4 so ddr4 HyperX there's one a
HyperX kit from kingston eight gigabytes
26:50 and that one is going to be $80 us
we don't know the frequency of Oh twenty
four hundred eight gigabyte 2400 so that
comes out to eighty dollars which is
actually if it's dual-stick is really
good sadly oh you see all this
mining stuff oh whoa Wow so this shop is
actually mining no it's not active it's
not out there selling yes so you think
they sell like the entire thinner just
like the asset demo probably like
made-to-order
all right
water okay so if if we want if we want
to order one $95,000 I come out to top
grant one ninety five thousand it's no
33 right yes dollars thirty three five
thousand nine hundred so you get the
whole the whole rack for five thousand
nine hundred with yeah what 85 85 80 so
twelve cards twelve cards five eighties
1300 watt power supply good memory oh
Claire I thought clef died chain 1 dou
xiao qian bao 68 US dollars 8 gigabytes
2,400 is that single stick or that is
that - 686 dollars for this one yeah
this is sick this is 68 no but it
doesn't need it this is ddr4 Wow it's
actually a good div eighty dollars
versus 94 from new eggs yeah 9406 94
dollars in the US for one stick is 90 96
in the US and she's 105 for a cake 2400
which is insane
and then here it's 80
ya know like anybody who comes to copy
sex yeah yeah if you need it now like
you're gonna go home and build a pill
system or whatever that's not bad
actually I hate to like walk in and like
ask all these questions and then not buy
anything it's kind of rude but whatever
they ask okay so that's punch the prices
at Guan ha dinner'll Plaza here in
Taiwan really not best CPUs are more or
less MSRP even in the u.s. prices GP is
still a little bit of over MSRP given
the circumstances that's to be expected
some of them are cheaper than we could
find in the u.s. most of them are a bit
more and price gaps are roughly
equivalent to what they should be it's
just they're all offset upwards to
account for mining prices shortages
stuff like that memory prices are so far
I haven't looked too hard okay so I
haven't spent a lot of just looking at
Amazon my phone right now so far some of
the memory tends to be a little bit
cheaper here than in the u.s. prices
just checking versus Amazon so if I
could get an affiliate link to this
place and post it below I've been to
that but otherwise I don't know we'll
see if if any of this price trend comes
over to the US but some of you have told
us in the comments that our memory
prices are crazier than yours and I
guess now I've seen that for example G
view prices kind of soso demand where
you learn so that's a plaza thank you
