years ago we posted an article entitled
how many watts does a gaming PC really
need which focused on testing multiple
configurations for power consumption we
started working on a revisit to this
last week he was seen the new cooler
master master watt bronze at 450 watt
PSU as a baseline seen as recently and
in general we vadoma kated for more 400
to 450 watt power supplies and build
this content piece shows how far we can
get on the lower wattage power supplies
with modern hardware before getting to
that list coverage is brought to you by
the EVGA 1080 TI sc2 and NVIDIA destiny
to bundle running up through September
4th the 1080i sc2 comes with a
synchronous fan control for its dual
fans and nine thermal sensors and again
includes destiny to learn more at the
link in the description below this is
kind of an old topic we've looked at it
probably a couple times over the years
because as Hardware iterates attempts to
get more power efficient generally
speaking so it's always worth going back
to and there was a period where 1,000
plus watt power supplies were pretty
common for gaming systems outside of the
mining craze where it actually kind of
makes sense but now with where modern
hardware is 400 450 Watts will really
get you quite far for something like a
1080 10 70s stuff like that
most people we see online pick stuff
that's 600 800 watts somewhere in that
range even that's a little overkill 600
is ok but once you start getting 700
plus it's it's not needed for really a
lot of the hardware that's out there
right you could do an i7 or an r7 or an
hour 5 build with a 1080 or a 1080i and
get away just fine at 600 watts and even
lower if you really wanted to which
we'll show today so we're using the
cooler master master while PSU which
we're just using because brand-new and
it's 450 watts and it's supposed to be I
think $50 which is where we want to see
them and with the lower wattage power
supplies hopefully becoming more
prevalent it's there's give me more
questions on line of weight can I
actually use 450 watts and get away with
PC so that's what we're gonna look at
today a couple of reasons you would want
a high-end PSU which is different from
just a high wattage power supply they're
not
they're not the same thing obviously so
high-end power supplies will get you
things like better voltage ripple which
has potentially a significant impact on
clock stability if you have a power spot
with a whole lot of voltage ripple cause
it's garbage then you're gonna end up
with problems with the clock dropping
like if you have say 80 to 100
millivolts the voltage ripple versus ten
that'll be noticeable especially with
overclocking other reasons for high end
power supplies are all the different
protections over current over power over
voltage stuff like that are built into
the thing to try and prevent either you
or an external force from inadvertently
destroying the power supplier that
components that hide behind it so a lot
of reasons for a high end unit but a
high end unit doesn't have to be high
wattage it can be a lower wattage unit
too so that's what we're looking at
today the point of this is mostly to
illustrate how overkill people go
because really you don't need 800 plus
watts for a lot of the stuff that's out
there let's start with idle power
consumption this is expectedly low
across the board and not really that
exciting you're well below a hundred
watts and pretty much all scenarios so
we can move on from this one quickly and
just go straight into gaming so look at
GTA 5
we tested games in 1080p and 1440p and
are only showing average draw for these
applications not the peak draw but the
average during the gaming scenario with
the msi gtx 1060 used which is the
lowest power consumer of the GPUs we
have on this charge and with these 1600
x combined with it we rest at just under
200 watts on average for GTA 5 EVGA is
1070 SC and 1600 x combo comes up next
running a power consumption of 220 to
240 watts with peak consumption at 246
this puts us around or a little over 50%
of the power supply's total continuous
capabilities meaning we're roughly at
the peak of the efficiency curve for the
230 volt outlets and europe and
elsewhere in the world for the master
watt bronze 450 watt unit for the u.s.
outlets at 115 volts peak efficiency is
closer to the 45 percent area pushing
beyond that 50 percent marker the 1080
FTW and 1600 x configuration consumes
about
230 to 270 watts and the 1080 plus 70
700 K a stock config draws 270 to 280 to
the latter positions us at around 62%
utilization which is really plenty
acceptable switching to an Rx 580 moves
us up between the 280 and 300 watt range
or both configurations around where the
4.9 gigahertz overclocked 7700 K antenna
80 land at 300 Watts draw we're using
67% of the power supplies available
continuous supply and at 230 volts we're
still plenty efficient at this point
just above 85% with 115 volt efficiency
dropping to around 85% or just below at
this point efficiency is less of a
concern that noise might be well as
power supplies will begin ramping fan
curve at this mark so noise levels rise
that increase may not be noticeable over
the rest of the systems of noise under
similar load granted but it's something
worth pointing out and just a quick side
note here the efficiency curve chart and
noise curve chart that we have are from
cooler masters marketing materials so
we're working with their scales here
total war is next and it gives us
another look at different types of game
performs for CPU load is higher with
performance ranging from 206 watts
consumption to 336 Watts average power
consumption at the wall across all the
configurations 336 wasps were breaching
74 percent utilization out of the 450
available which increases us along the
fan curve acts as significantly now at
around 7 to 8 DB a higher than the 60%
mark and we validated this with our own
DB meter that's not a concern the power
supply can still handle it especially
considering that most gamers aren't
putting their systems under constant
high utilization scenario is non-stop
this is sustained for gaming it's still
fine it's just not ideal we're also
losing a head room here for the spike
your load levels which peaked at 3 54
watts with a 1080 and 7700 KOC system
and losing room for additional
components or GPU overclocking
realistically you really shouldn't pair
a 450 watt power supply with a GTX 1080
and overclock study 700 K anyway because
you're spending that kind of money on
those components you probably have
enough money to buy a higher wattage
power supply and although you don't need
it's worth getting with those high-end
components just to have the overhead for
GPU overclocking that's not of interest
and you've got some room but still at
some point you draw the line and when
you're spending that much money it is
worth considering a slightly higher
wattage power supply just to give
yourself room because you can move these
power supplies from one system to the
next as you iterate and build but either
way that doesn't mean you couldn't use
the lower wattage ones like the 450 watt
unit we have here
here's rocket League where we see lower
power consumption due to the lighter
weight workload at the very high end
we're drawing 284 watts give or take
keeping us reasonably close to peak
efficiency on the curve and lower noise
levels this games not that stressful
though speaking of not that stressful in
terms of power consumption we can look
at the production and synthetic
workloads that are more CPU driven we're
clearly well below the 50% mark here as
the GPU remains unutilized and other
resources don't engage as heavily we're
well under 200 watts and most of these
tests so clearly for a lot of gaming
builds you'd be fine
with 450 watts you'd be fine with 400
watts if you can find one the problem is
towards the lower wattage end of the
scale there's a whole lot more garbage
components a lot a lot more cheap stuff
that may be 80 plus white if you're
lucky for efficiency ratings but
otherwise kind of gets untrustworthy in
that area
so it's harder to find power supplies in
the 400 watt range that are actually
good value for the money without also
getting into the dangerous component
assembly area but 450 watts is starting
to fill out now cooler masters got this
Silverstone's been pushing for 400 450
watts for a while now and they have good
product in that category EVGA is
starting to work on it
Corsair starting to get more of those
out there so it's becoming more popular
for 50 especially and clearly it's
enough power for a lot of configurations
the ones we built here aren't meant to
be like the best PC you get build just
meant to be here's a look at a couple of
popular components thrown together and
what kind of power they consume
arguments for higher wattage you can go
with would be well maybe you want to
transplant the power supply into future
systems and maybe a train you're trying
to do more with it
or planning to do something like
multi-gpu or memory or CPU overclock and
GPU overclocking things like that
there's argument there for higher
wattage power supplies but for a lot of
builds really get away with this or with
stuff even in the 400 watt range
especially when you're looking at the
lower end GPUs that are lower power
consumption so that's all we wanted to
point out is that you really don't need
these 800 watt power supplies everyone
wants to use now with Vega 56 and 64
when you start doing stuff like we're
doing and stay tuned for this content
and pushing the power target by a
hundred plus percent then you probably
want it we were drawing a hundred plus
well it might have been 150 watts more
in some cases than stock so there are
reasons to go with higher wattage but
most people don't ever get into that
territory so that's all for this one as
always you can help us out directly on
patreon.com slash gamers Nexus gamers
Nexus squarespace.com to pick up a shirt
like this one and a side note will be at
PAX West this weekend
I suppose so if you see us there give us
a shout otherwise stay tuned for the
coverage subscribe for all that and
we'll see you all next time
