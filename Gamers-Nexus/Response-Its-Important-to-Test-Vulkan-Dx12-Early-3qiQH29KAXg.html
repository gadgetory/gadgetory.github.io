cuff I was actually in the middle of
renovating or set and changing some
things up on the set but I saw more
YouTube comments on our Vulcan and our
dx12 videos and they started driving me
a little crazy so the comments that
we're seeing lately are along the lines
of why are you testing Vulcan or dx12 so
early it's not even done yet the games
aren't done yet none of this is
adequately supported all you're doing is
making these things look bad well here's
the thing about that so first of all to
think that because something is new and
unfinished it should not be tested is
just horribly short-sighted and it's for
a million reasons the main one is that
our site is pretty scientific in its
approach to everything so when we get
news that a new API is in the pipes or a
new game is being developed or anything
like that we start testing it as soon as
it is possible and that's because we
want to plot the trend line of this
thing and proving because that's really
cool data right if we look at Vulcan now
today we look at Talos principle
whatever it is and see that this thing
is actually a little bit worse than TX
11 right now but maybe three months from
now it's actually starting to achieve
parity then three months later it starts
surpassing it as the developers have
predicted maybe a thirty percent gain or
whatever that's really cool to see that
is progress and first of all from a
media standpoint there are a lot of
sites that are all going to be
benchmarking this stuff as soon as it
comes out and we've got to compete
secondly from an analytical from a
scientific standpoint from an industry
standpoint we need to see how this stuff
actually iterates does it do what it
says it can do from a marketing
standpoint all these companies they're
all dx12 volcom this welcome that dx12
can do all these things but as soon as
it's available we don't touch it because
the game's not done or whatever the
complaints are on YouTube that's that's
just bad that's a bad approach to
anything because then we're really not
validating these claims that the
marketing people are making at the
various companies the API companies GPU
companies the game companies so we
validate those claims first of all and
then we make huge giant disclaimers all
throughout the video in the content that
basically say you know look this might
not be done yet here's what we know
right now it's pretty
cool it might happen or maybe the
converse maybe it's terrible and won't
happen but for dhol milk and we've
basically said you know this stuff is
cool it's on the right track it can
actually do great things for games these
new API is they can really tap into
hardware in a way that can't be done
with dx11 or whatever other API is
OpenGL and that's cool stuff but we also
put into perspective of you know this
isn't something that you download today
you don't just download Vulcan so just
because something I've seen asked you
don't just download these things these
AP is or go download games that actually
do support them much that's why it
really works you get a game it has it
integrated you don't just pull one of
those down the pipes and immediately see
improvement no actually right now it's
all sort of up in the air while
developers are trying to integrate
properly from the ground up that's
something we talked about with chris
Roberts in our interview with him about
Vulcan and dx12 where basically he says
you know it's going to take some time
for games to properly support these new
api's and that's because they basically
have to be built from the ground up yeah
you can just do pointers and calls and
change the calls from DX 11 to 12 or
whatever so technically it will execute
on the new API but that doesn't mean
it's actually taking advantage of it and
talking to the CPU we're talking through
explicit multi-gpu functions or whatever
other feature set you want to access
those have to be added manually so yes
it takes time the games have to be built
from the ground up we've said that
several times in the videos and tried to
talk everyone through why these api's
take salons really get to market in a
perceptible manner rather than the way
they are right now which is they're
technically available as libraries to
developers but they're not really
executing for gamers so we talked about
all that but I just wanted to point out
that you know to say that it's not good
to test something because it's not done
is very short-sighted we want to build
up a database we want to see all this
data as it progresses it'd be really
cool to build charts and show here's how
this technology was a year ago when we
first tested it when it was in its early
stages not beta but in early stages or
maybe even beta and then here's hit
where it was six months ago here's where
it is today and this is the trend line
we can see them
movement whatever overtakes some other
technology something like that so that's
really cool that's content that we've
done in the past and is a lot of fun to
work on it's fun for everyone to watch
and read and that's why we test these
things constantly aside from the fact
that we're also validating claims where
we've got these you know billion and
million dollar companies just dumping
resources into marketing / AP is or what
have you we have to validate that to
protect the consumer whatever all that
other stuff that I basically just
explained the last few minutes here so
that's hard for this hedge one to really
jump on camera here in the middle of
adding to our set I've been building a
new set wall over here off camera and I
saw those comments and needed to jump on
camera and talk about it so that is all
for this video as always hit the link
the description below to check out the
channel on the website subscribe if you
like it hit us up on patreon all that
good stuff thank you for watching and of
course I know not all the fans and
viewers yeah are against testing Vulcan
or dx12 I know that but just for those
who have been adamant that its
technology that shouldn't for some
reason be tested right now want to put
this out there so thank you for watching
that listening to the half rant half
explanation I will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
