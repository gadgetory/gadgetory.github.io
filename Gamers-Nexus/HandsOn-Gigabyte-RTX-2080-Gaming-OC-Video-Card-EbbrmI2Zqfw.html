Gamescom at the gigabyte booth so
gigabytes got a couple there are TX
cards we did not see that Mike Gamescom
and the ones here are from the gaming
series so there's gaming OC cards
there's a twenty eighty and a twenty
eighty TTI behind the glass they are as
I understand it probably the reference
PCB designs we were not allowed to take
it apart this time go figure but I can
see the cooler though so we can give you
some information on the cooler four
gigabytes new series for the r-tx 20
launched and we'll go through some of
that in today's video before that this
video is brought to you by the NZXT e
series power supplies the e series PS
use our high end power supplies with
real time digital voltage and
temperature monitoring per rail wattage
measurements and data logging
functionality for power usage the e
series PSU is also come with a 10 year
warranty all the way down to the 500
watt unit and they run fully modular and
with silent fan operating modes
learn more at the link below so for the
cooler on this one
I think this is the 20 80 in front of me
it both are three fan coolers this is
gonna be really common for this
generation because NVIDIA is now making
its own dual axial cooler so anybody has
kind of seeping into the market where
the AIB partners typically would make
their low-end cards with dual fan
coolers so you're gonna see a lot of try
fan coolers for this generation and
that's what we have here today so to
three fan coolers for each of the cards
it's the same cooler as far as I can
tell right now I should note nothing is
100% final I can tell by looking at it
some of this stuff is handmade so it's
it's a little bit early but we have some
basics and one of the basic things we
have is gigabyte now so the backplate on
this it does not have at least on this
model that copper block on back of the
GPU that we previously criticized as
being non-functional so that's cool to
see they got rid of the the useless
block on the back and just went with a
straight back plate it's an aluminum
backplate and there are in the present
model there are two millimeter thick
thermal pads and at least two locations
maybe three between the back the piece
to be in the back plate and those are
our behind the GDD r6 memory and part of
the vrm so it's not crucial to sync heat
into a backplate but it does help and
one thing I should note is if you touch
the back of a card and it feels really
hot that's a good thing
that means the backplate is doing its
job it's sinking the heat away from the
parts that matter so they've got their
own pads there
we tested this in the past with other
vendors other manufacturers and have
found that it actually works quite well
not sure if it doesn't this but it
probably will be the same basic
principle so for the cooler so if it's
got three separate finding stacks so
there's a fin stack over here on the i/o
side of the card and that one's the most
interesting because as I said this is
probably almost certainly a reference
PCB design at least right now and the
reference PCB design looks to have some
of the vrm components on the i/o side so
typically you see it all kind of on one
side to the right of the GPU unless it's
like an HB I'm card in which case you
have an l-shape vrm but this one has
part of the BRM over here part over here
and from the top top my had the ten
eight the 20 atti
i think is a thirteen plus three setup
and we'll talk about this more later and
the twenty eighty ninety i is something
like an eight plus two or eight plus
three
we'll talk about it closer to launch but
that's the layout we have so part of the
VRMs on one side parts on the other and
that's why there are three separate thin
stacks one of which is straight over the
GPU once over the right side BRM once
over the left side VRM and for the rest
of the cooling solution there's about a
one millimeter or last maybe 0.5
millimeter thick they're all pad between
the g6 memory and the cold plate or
actually a a connecting plate for the
memory that goes to the cold plate which
is something we've seen before it tends
to work pretty well so connecting the
memory straight in to the cold plate
which is on the GPU it'll make the GPU
temperatures appear higher but in
reality that's because it's sharing the
cooling solution with the memory as well
and that actually tends to be a net
positive but it depends on the design
heat pipes there are three on this side
that I can see there are four on this
side that I can see there might be more
in there as I said not allowed to take
it apart but that's my understanding
right now an eight and a six pin
connector and then there is a metal
plate between the inductors and the fin
stack over here so they've got direct
contact between even the inductors and
the cooling for what we can see right
now and then I think final item of note
here that's pretty interesting is this
has two fan headers and also a
synchronous cooling design which is
something I think Nvidia's publicly
talked about at this point but this is
technically this is one of those areas
where ebj did that first before on video
this isn't a gigabyte thing doing what
they did this is Nvidia doing what EVGA
did with the asynchronous point so
that's a point of interest for the
future that there
two connectors and it will have a
synchronous fan which just means that
you can run the fans of different speeds
if you wanna cool the GPU differently
from the BRM components and memory
components stuff like that and I think
that covers the entire cooling solution
for the card so this is the gigabyte or
the ars as it may be called later Gaming
OSI model and we saw the twenty eighty
and twenty atti today what we don't know
is how do they custom PCBs look and
we'll find that out closer to launch
most likely the custom PCB is if you
missed our Gamescom coverage will be
coming a bit after launch for the most
part because Nvidia gave everyone
extremely late notice some of us the
cards you're gonna see are gonna mean
three fan coolers maybe some new cooler
designs and up Fitz and then the
reference PCB with custom stuff coming
out later so that's it for the gigabyte
