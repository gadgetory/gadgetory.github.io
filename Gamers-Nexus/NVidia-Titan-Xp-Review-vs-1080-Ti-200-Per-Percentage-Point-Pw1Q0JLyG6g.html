way into our hands on loan from a reader
before cranking away on the hybrid bond
we ran all the numbers and benchmarked
the car just like we would for any
gaming GPU on our bench this isn't
necessarily something meant for gaming
though it still carries a GeForce GTX
branding and could certainly throw down
some numbers in benchmarks today we're
testing the Titan XP versus the best and
worst 1080 TI cards on the market all
tests were conducted under stock
conditions at check back tomorrow for
part two of our hybrid mod with part
three arian shortly after containing the
results for the Titan XP is no thermal
limit before getting to that this
content is brought to you by ifixit.com
who helps provide the toolkits necessary
to mob the Titan XP into the hybrid card
that will soon be unveiling on YouTube I
fix it makes the pro attack toolkit
which is $60 on their website you can
find a link in the description below for
more information
use code gamers nexus for five dollars
off the Titan XP at $1,200 isn't really
advertised for gaming but that won't
stop people from buying it for gaming
because they want the best that's kind
of what a lot of people do in the market
and that means we're going to test it
from a gaming standpoint now this is
something that is more suitable for
something like neural-net or machine
learning type applications that grant
the reader who loaned us the card is one
of those developers who works in neural
net applications and so could take
advantage of the extra one gigabyte of
memory over something like a 1080p eye
for gaming it's an extra $500
potentially for minimal gain but we will
find out shortly and just to kind of
throw that in there although NVIDIA
doesn't market the cards as a gaming
device heavily it does still contain
GeForce GTX branding on it and it does
have the words gaming appear a few times
in its product page information on the
official website since we don't
specialize in neural networks I took the
opportunity to ask grant how he would
use the Titan XP nuts more targeted
application grant stated the following
data sizes can vary and the GPU limits
are based on data size and the applied
algorithm a simple linear regression can
be done easily on most GPUs but when it
comes to convolutional neural networks
the amount of math is huge I have a four
gig data set
run at CNN on the 1080i but it can do it
on the Titan X also for us CUDA cores
matter a lot and the good machine
learning algorithms even Google's
tensorflow
need kudos and and video specific
drivers to use the GPU s why does not do
anything for us multiple GPUs can be
used to split up data sets and run them
in parallel but it's tricky as hell as
neural networks with multiple cards it's
better for us to run one algorithm on
one card and another algo on the next
card even Google created their own
version of a GPU for deep learning that
can be farmed much better than any
Nvidia option so that's what it's meant
for but we are going to be testing it
with gaming because again people will be
buying it for gaming whether or not
that's the best thing they should be
doing just to clear of a few things
there is GeForce GTX branding on this
card in the initial renders of the Titan
XP that Brandon was not present they
were 3d renders so they were not the
actual product the fact that it appears
on this card doesn't really mean
anything other than nvidia probably took
the same tooling and applied it here
once again if we look under the hood the
card here the Titan XP with the little P
uses AGP 102 - 450 GPU whereas a Titan X
2016 edition the one we previously
called Titan X capital P that one uses
GP 102 - 400 so this is a rev higher its
- 450 and if that's not enough for you
to tell the difference you could also
look at the back of the card the Titan
XP lacks DVI ports whereas the Titan X
2016 has a DVI out so that those are the
two primary differences here since the
branding on the outside looks
functionally the same actually in every
aspect for the full specs on the card
you can check the article linked in the
description below which contains the
review and all the benchmarks that
you'll see here along with some extras
the Titan XP again $1200 card is about
$500 a head of MSRP for the 1080i
reference card and other than that there
that's I mean that's really all there is
there will be no adding board partner
models of the Titan XP the one you see
here is our modded version it does not
come with a liquid cooler it comes with
a normal F equal er and it's Nvidia only
you can only buy it from Nvidia com
getting to the benchmarks will put the
OC stepping table on the screen now
since we referencing that as we go
through some of the overclock benchmark
numbers the hybrid mod will come shortly
here after
and it will probably contain a bit
higher clocks because it's liquid-cooled
for full methodology and testing
procedures check the link below for the
article in the description looking at
total system power draw at the wall with
3d mark fire strike extreme the Titan XP
system draws around the same power as a
1080 ISC 2 cards from EVGA oh and
brother stock each system draws around
345 watts overclocking the Titan XP gets
it to around 400 watts total system
power draw for an increase of about 15
percent of the stock card the only
configuration that draws more powers on
this is expectedly the crossfire 580
plus 480 grouping at 460 watts or about
16% more power draw than the ti XP
looking at for honor next to the Titan
XP card stock configuration draws about
355 watts about 10 watts behind the 1080
is CPU a card with the boosted power
budget on that PCB overclocked MPI XP
pushes its power draws at 375 watts
total system power consumption for an
increase of about 6 percent in this
particular workload Ghost Recon
wildlands post total system power dried
around 370 375 watts for the stock se 2
and for the stock Titan XP cards with an
overclocked Titan XP we see that jump to
424 watts total system power drop the
wall that's an increase of about 13
percent power consumption from the
overclock alone finally idle power
consumption for the full system is at
about 75 watts the ti XP system and
about 73 watch for the 1080 T is e2
system given our less tight tolerances
for power testing compared to other
testing that this is effectively
identical let's get into the most
interesting aspect of this cards and
thermals traditionally the Nvidia
founders Edition coolers have been the
most limiting aspects of the cards this
can typically be compensated with higher
fan RPMs at the cost of noise but our
hybrid models resolve both issues with
one go as do the AIB partner models
which will be present for the ti XP the
Titan XP doesn't do too poorly here
though we're still hitting a thermal
wall around 84 C with a fan stopping at
around 55% fan speed from the default
profile when under load
but clock fluctuations and fan
fluctuations are shockingly study with
this card but we're still losing at
least 100 megahertz off the clock as
soon as thermal start rising our range
is about 120 megahertz with
the important point being that the clock
remains steady after its drop that 100
megahertz that's good and bad it's ideal
for the classroom and stable as we're
seeing here for the most part but it is
less than ideal for them to drop as a
result of thermals that can be fixed by
a better cooler that keeps frame times
more consistent in the least our hybrid
model talked about this more and attempt
to keep the higher clock speed
maintained keep in mind that this is a
power virus workload so the clock does
not enumerate in the same way that it
would during a gaming workload fox will
therefore be lower here in looks but
we're just looking for stability not max
speed moving now to a thermal analysis
chart we're looking at component
temperatures using thermocouples mount
the MOSFETs and the vram components we
can compare against 1080i FP momentarily
for a look at a nearby EPI card the
Titan xpf at number 7 hold the
temperature around 68 to 70 Celsius with
its vram temperature around ADC this is
pretty common for the vram temperature
though we haven't expanded that test
into the 1080p IFE just yet GPU
temperatures for the Titan XP are in the
84 C range as you'd expect which is
roughly equal to the temperature of a
1080i F II card let's get the F II
temperatures on the screen now just to
expand this chart of it the temperatures
are all roughly the same once we're
under load which makes sense seeing as
the Titan XP is using a PCBs basically a
1080 TI fe PCB Fe PCB for what it's
worth was one that we praise fairly
highly in our component level vrm
analysis by build void but again it's
about the same as we see on the Titan XP
here fans ramp at exactly the same
profile between the TI x PM at 1080 TI
if you are curious as do temperatures
and clocks so the 1080 TI runs a higher
clock overall the TI GPU temperature is
wanted to see higher in the beginning of
the test but the cards get closer over
time for noise testing we're measuring
at 20 inches away and doing so with a
passively cooled system the only
component making noise in the system is
the GPU fans be that idle is the same
for the Titan XP as for all other
founders Edition cards of this
generation
running at around 22% idle fan speed
with a be partners demonstrating the
noise floor with passive
operation under idle conditions the
Titan XP maintains an output of about 31
DBA idle which should be covered up by
the case fans and most systems Auto
speeds lands the Titan XP at 47.9 DBA
when operating in the 55% fan speed
range compared to AIB partner 1080 TI
cards in the 30s and 40s this
demonstrates the value of those AIB
cards but again none will exist for the
Titan XP at 50% fan speed we're looking
at a noise output of around 40 4.9 DBA
with MSI and gigabyte around the same
noise levels with EVGA a bit higher
you'd ideally never run a 100% fan speed
on any of these GPUs but we've included
the numbers to demonstrate maximum noise
possible anyway moving on to FPS
benchmarks we don't expect to see any
extraordinary gains over the 1080i cards
but we'll see if that $500 difference
makes any impact on our gaming tests
starting with Ghost Recon wildlands at
4k and very high settings the NVIDIA
Titan XP stock card performs at around
60 FPS average with lows at 52 and 48
this puts the card tied with the
overclocked 1080i gaming X and our own
overclocked hybrid 1080i f:e mod leading
stock 1080p I cards by a couple percent
versus the 1080p IFE reference card
we've got about an 8% gain from 55.3 to
60fps average over the AIB partner 1080
is he to card that we just reviewed
configured stock we see a percentage
gain of about 2.2 percent average with
frame times effectively equal that means
you're spending over $200 per percentage
point gained in performance overclocking
doesn't change much the ti XP takes the
lead at 65 FPS average followed next by
the 1080 is C 2 a 2 FPS average the
percentage difference here is 5 percent
so we're only paying $100 per percentage
point once overclocking is permitted at
1440p the Titan XP performs identically
in averages to the 1080p is C 2 card and
close to the gigabyte extreme RS card
both are priced at 720 and 750 dollars
respectively currently anyway the Titan
XP it falls slightly behind the 1080i
cards and frame times are not in any
meaningful way however this is a trend
we see in a few other places later
overclocking boost the ti XP to 104 FPS
average that we run at the thermal and
power limits that threaten clock
stability and therefore
or frame time performance we're at 104
FPS average versus 99 average on the
closest Natt IOC card that's about a 5%
lead again consistent with the 4k
results we see the same performance at
1080p with the Titan XP overclocked
faltering and frame time consistency in
exchange for a 5% lead over the EVGA sc2
and averages Mass Effect Andromeda at 4k
positions the Titan XP at 68 FPS average
just behind the 1080i gaming X and ahead
of the 1080 T is c2 from EVGA these
three cards are effectively equal in
performance given standard deviation run
to run and are completely equal with
regard to user experience at 1440p the
Titan XP ties again with the MSI 1080i
gaming X and slightly leaves the EVGA
1080i sc2 cards all around 131 to 132
FPS average running Doom at 4k with
Vulcan and ultra settings with Titan XP
star card runs around 94 FPS average
ahead of the 1080i reference card by
about 5 percent Titan XP is effectively
tied with the pen ATI reference card
once the thermal constraint is removed
as seen in our hybrid mod and falls
behind at the higher clock rates of all
the other cards in the bench a real
argument Titan XP boosts it to 108 FPS
average on this clock sensitive game
particularly benefiting from a big
memory overclock begin about 3% of the
1080 TI extreme horas and that's
rounding up if we're being generous
leading to about a $160 cost per
percentage point gained running for
honor at 4k the Titan XP stock performs
around 72 FPS average title to gaming X
and averages but behind it marginally
and lows with 52 fps 0.12 61 FPS yo kwon
percent lows 1080 is c2 runs a 71 FPS
average tailing the Titan XP by 2.2
percent once again overclocking in this
game it proves problematic for nearly
all devices we've tested with stability
becoming an issue without backing off
the OC in substantial ways still the TI
XP manages to cling to the top spot just
barely once overclocked though does
falter again and lows slightly for at 4k
resolution with the x12 annexing compute
allowed our crossfire rx 518 480 combo
to outperform a reference 1080i thanks
to friends a multi GPU optimization in
this game
titin XP runs at 87 FPS average in the
title just ahead of the game and acts at
6 FPS average and just behind the
overclock 1080p is d2 card we've got a
weed of about fourteen point nine
percent over the reference 1080i or
about ten point four percent ahead of
the crossfire cards was particularly
well optimized title overclocking gets
us a reasonable lead of eleven point
five percent over the sc2 overclocked
card but in our costs per percentage
point increase down to forty dollars
since that's apparently a new metric
that we need to use with this card
clearly this is not a good buy for
gaming do not buy this card for gaming
you would be far better off if you need
something high-end with a 10 80 TI
because you could buy either one of
these two variants of the 1080i this one
is 720 today so that may go up we've
been told and this one is 750 either way
they're both going to for sure be sums
with your below and that is a savings of
something like $450 over a $1200 TI XP
and the performance is roughly the same
it's like two percent in some cases
different and once you've overclocked at
these outperform until you overclock
that in which case it's maybe a five
percent difference for that much money
$100 per percentage point at 5 percent
not such a good deal so we would not
really recommend this for gaming however
that doesn't mean it's a bad video card
big difference right it's an OK card
it's just not OK for the price so what
this thing is meant for it seems we're
not experts in neural networks is stuff
like what grant does the guy who loaned
us the device if you are doing something
like neural net look for a review where
they specialize in that kind of thing
they can tell you if it's good for that
application apparently the extra 1
gigabyte really helps in certain types
of algorithms and workloads for gaming
the extra 1 gigabyte of VRAM is totally
irrelevant and the extra cores are
clearly not giving us any kind of
advantage over the really anything else
we've got on the bench so that's it for
the Titan XP review thank you grant for
loaning us this card if you want to help
us out directly you can go to
patreon.com/scishow spawned our in-depth
testing we have part two and three of
this coming up very shortly for the
hybrid mod results should be pretty
interesting on that when you get a store
that gamers nexus net to buy shirts like
these and subscribe for more thank you
I'll see you all next time
