mac slick tech tr4 cooler so this is a
closed-loop or as some people call it a
io liquid cooler and we took it apart
for our part of our review and talked
about how it actually goes together
really well it's high-quality materials
nice metal body for the pump housing and
should be pretty easy to refill so in
terms of closed-loop coolers and a iOS
this is the most serviceable we've seen
yet and now it's time to actually
demonstrate that so we've got a funnel
that we made we're gonna pour some
liquid and reassemble the whole thing
and see how the data looks compared to
the original out of factory build but
before we get into that this coverage is
brought to you by ifixit.com and their
Pro Tech tool kit I fix it as refreshing
their Pro Tech tool kit in time for the
holidays you can find a link in the
description below to the Pro Tech tool
kit and other toolkits that iFixit sells
we find the Pro Tech and essentials kits
to be the most useful for DIY
enthusiasts so for what I have in front
of me we have the cooler which we
previously disassembled on camera this
is a thread Ripper cooler it has a
threader precised cold plate that
actually performs really well in our
testing and we need to reassemble
everything first so do that and then
once that's done we'll be able to refill
the liquid it had about 200 millimeters
millimeters 200 milliliters of liquid
when we measured it originally plus or
minus a couple drops that we didn't
catch in the measuring cup and I have
next to me just some this comes with the
ek fluid gaming kits so this is just I
poured it in here for film purposes but
it's just distilled water and the ek
cryo fluid whatever mixture they have so
it's mixed to the ek spec it's not going
to be the exact same propylene glycol
mixture but it should be pretty close
then we'll be able to see if there's a
performance disparity that would be
measurable from it but really the point
is by doing this this is something you
could use to keep the cooler alive
because closed loop coolers tend to have
permeation issues after about 5 years so
if you have a long service life and a
thread ripper workstation you might want
to keep the cooler for 5 years or more
if you start seeing before
degradation you hear pump gurgling
noises or air being sucked through the
loop that means that there is permeation
where the liquid is starting to seep
into the tubes and so to help solve for
that you can take it apart as we did
drain what's in there and then refill it
to about 200 milliliters plus or minus
whatever is extra so yeah we put all of
our excess fluid gaming stuff in these
vials that we had for a b-roll prop and
we're just going to refill the thing
with a funnel made out of a sort of
plastic coated paper so that hopefully
shouldn't decay too much as we're
pouring it we taped it with gaff tape
and yeah let's just get started with
reassembly so I think it's been a while
since I took it apart so I need to try
and remember the exact order for
reassembly which I think the best way to
do it is probably sort of watching our
own videos remember it probably gonna be
dropping that in there but there's a
gasket that needs to go in first so we
have a rubber gasket that goes around
this thingy here so it's not perfectly
clean it's pretty clean though so the
gasket will go around there okay so that
should pretty much take care of that
cable goes through the cable channel
right there so that's where the cable
goes and now I think we have a bunch of
screws
okay so that should be tight enough that
there's no leakage in that seal
hopefully but that's what we got for
getting the motor back in then this has
to push down and I think over that we're
gonna put the pump cap don't remember
what way this was oriented though could
do it either way I guess alright that's
pretty secure no liquids in that chamber
anyway next thing is the bottom so we
already put the gasket back in on the
other side there's a gasket on this side
too which is this one and it does have
two different sizes to it so it does
actually matter how you put this back on
I think the correct orientation is this
one yes it'll fit kind of funny the
other way so that's how it goes back on
there is there so there's actually a
little bit of rust in here or something
corrosion of some kind which if we grab
the giant Torx 20 I can show here's
where we're gonna try and refill it -
and these giant things these are TR
these are Torx 20s so I think that's
definitely corrosion on the end of that
and you can't really you're not gonna be
able to see it but there's corrosion
down inside the chamber as well I think
there's a little bit around here not
positive on that last part though but I
think this comes from probably the screw
they're using I also it's possible that
this would not be an issue if we had
never emptied it to begin with if they
had some kind of agent in the liquid to
prevent corrosion and you know we've
left this sitting for a while now with
no liquid in it so whatever was left in
there if it wasn't the right mixture may
have caused
so we can't really blame anyone for it
but copper bolts would avoid that as
well so let's let's get the plate back
in this orientation probably matters as
well I would have to look at our own
video to see what it was though so I
know this is right because I can see the
outline of where the fatter part of the
gasket was which is over here as opposed
to the outline of the skinnier part over
there and I could reference our video
but these are gonna have to be really
tight this isn't the right size but I
just want a couple turns on it that's
agree great use of a magnet so these
screws are nice because you really you
can't over tighten them they go until
they hit a point then stop and that's
gonna make our lives a lot easier okay
so we're good on these those are secure
so we already took off one of these I
guess I'll leave the other on and we
just need to try and refill it I think
the plan I don't think there's a better
spot to do this certainly not in the
pump block there's not a better spot I
don't know if we started taking these
embellishments off the radiator if we'd
find a secret but I mean there's no
tanks over here the tanks are on the
ends and unless it's hidden under a
sticker no there's no refill cap in
those we could probably take one of the
barbs the tube off the bar but that's
really not any better than doing what
I'm about to do so I think what we're
gonna do is I'm gonna hold it up kind of
higher for gravity refill up here and
then just like tip it and hope that it
refills the whole thing and I think the
best way to know when it's full because
it's probably gonna take a few tries me
like move closing it and moving the
radiator around best way to know when
it's full is probably gonna be to fill
this container to be 200 milliliters
that we measured previously and then
just pour that amount in plus maybe a
little bit extra how much
how much just 200 so I'm gonna pour like
205 to 210 just to allow some room for
spilling or for what I spilled on the
way out previously so that's probably
it's probably about 220 right now okay
got a funnel we made I'm just gonna put
some tape around that okay hopefully
this works coming out of the tube I
think right of the funnel now I poured
too much in
okay so some of that went in okay so
first the time to no good
it's somewhat refilled that time
it's like bleeding brakes or something
both those are full this size way easier
which I think I shouldn't have to do
with flow direction because the pumps
not on but whatever so that trick is
much they get air bubbles moving if
there are any basically like burping
brakes if you've ever done that for
something like a bike same idea actually
here I liquid in there now that's good
so new development is I was resealing
those to be safe each time but you can
get it to tip about this far before it
starts coming out of the top which is
enough for it to start going down the
tubes so I'm able to just do that
instead of recapping it which is gonna
make this about four times faster that's
two screws I don't have to do every
single time now it's also gonna allow me
to more accurately refill the unit to
the amount it's built for so we're gonna
lose it a little bit like a drop where I
first starts Hilton and then once I can
see where my limit is how far I can go
like right there I see the liquid coming
out we just stop tilting it and let it
drain straight down into the tubes the
tubes need to be vertical nice this is
actually gonna work with how much these
things cost it would be worth your time
to spend like I mean now that I figured
out how to do it should only take really
30 to 40 minutes to do a rebuild well
you got unbuilt it's hits maybe call it
an hour but I'm getting most the tricks
so that should make it faster for you
and for how much they cost it if it
takes you an hour to do it
and it saves you 130 bucks 150 bucks
that's basically 130 dollars an hour not
too bad
okay so we turned the pump on once it
got pretty much
all so that the pumps lubricated enough
it won't hurt itself and now we're just
topping off the last couple drops of
fluid turning the pump on helped a lot
you don't want to do that unless you
know it's not going to burn out but once
you have enough liquid in there to start
with it does make it a lot easier to
pour more quickly at this point I'm just
trying to figure out how many more drops
of fluid it needs it's getting pretty
close you can even see the liquid
entering through this tube like down the
hole so I'm not really gonna be able to
show that but I can see it coming in
through there now
the pumps making some noise a little
unhappy but we should be able to fix
that and second yeah okay that's a lot
better pump is quiet and down a bit now
losing some fluid because I have 2
radiator above it obviously it's mostly
they're gonna use a couple more drops of
liquid but it is mostly okay at this
point it's only unhappy when it's
fighting gravity with the tubes so that
means it just needs to be topped off
probably another 10 or 20 milliliters so
I will do that off-camera but as far as
this goes I think we're pretty much done
so get in there so yeah it takes a
little bit but if you spend a lot of
money for the cooler which probably did
the 360 is 360 $150 so you spent a lot
of money for the cooler might be worth
doing to make this easier a larger hole
for one a hole in the radiator tanks
would be ideal enter max if you're like
listening and you if you actually want
this to be a feature or a selling point
of the cooler then stick an access valve
in the radiator tank I don't I don't
think it would have been better for us
to go through the tube I think going the
way we did
probably one of the easier ways there
might be another something hidden away
somewhere but that's best I got so yeah
it's refillable now we just need to test
it and see how it actually performs so
we'll do that separately and keep an eye
out for that hopefully it should be
about the same performance worst case or
maybe slightly better depending on if
this coolant I filled it with is better
or worse than what it came with so
