remaining RX lineup so these are the new
radeon cards and at e3 today and they
talked about its RX 470 and RX for 60
which fill in the 100 to 300 dollar
rains it could be more in there we don't
know for sure because we didn't get
pricing information on these cards or
really much else so what we've got right
now the RX 480 is positioned in the 200
to 250 2 30 somewhere in their range for
the 4 gigabyte and 8 gigabyte models
respectively that one has been announced
since just before computex and that card
is it meant more for the higher end
gaming for VR things like that dropping
down a bit the RX 470 is targeted as of
today at 1440p gaming and the RX 460 is
targeted at 1080p at 60 FPS gaming so
sort of they haven't given us
specifications what the graphic settings
are supposed to be or really anything
like that we don't know the compute unit
count we don't know how many stream
processors there are you don't know how
much memory theory as we don't know the
release date specifically anyway and we
don't know the price except for the RX
484 release date price and specs but for
its outing for 60 we don't have anything
yet so we know they exist we know that
we'll find out more on jun 29th with the
RX 480 launch and other than that the
other major thing that Andy mentioned
was a very specific move toward more
mobile notebook GPUs so this is a space
where Andy has been lacking for a couple
years now if you go out today right now
and look for notebooks on newegg amazon
wherever there's a very good chance i
would wager that you'd find almost
entirely intel and nvidia devices
particularly at the sort of seven
hundred dollar plus range AMD has almost
no presence there Polaris with its
process reduction with its efficiency
gains is going to be a better use case
for notebooks than previous and the
processors or GPUs because of that
increased power efficiency that didn't
exist previously so that is something
Andy very explicitly said they will be
targeting with the new ray
beyond RX series other than that we have
no good information but we know they
exist now so that's really all I got for
you on this stuff link in the
description below if you want to read
the same thing that I just said because
we had the same amount of information
obviously a little bit frustrating to
not get a whole lot more than that but
that's III so as always pay traveling
through postal video subscribe for more
information I'll see you all next time
he's got brand new releases so then the
1060 becomes a concern but we'll come
back to that in a moment as far as the
RX 480 its positioning as a 4 gigabyte
card at two hundred dollars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
