are now looking at them MSI motherboard
so we just looked at their video cards
and now we're talking about motherboards
mostly for broad well II today these are
on the same x99 chipset as haswell-e
motherboards we're on but with some
differences in these are important to
note first of all all the boards are
labeled as x 99 a that a suffix is not
an Intel thin it's not the new x99 a
chipset from Intel it is in fact MSI's
sort of the suffix that just identifies
that these are for broad well II they're
built for broad well II not for
haswell-e that out of the way the main
things here to look at are the x 99 a
gaming pro carbon the x 99 a titanium
and the soon to come x 99 asli plus
which is in the same family as the z1
70s li+ but updated for broadwell each
hip sets and the like so of these boards
the titanium ones really the major
overclocking focused one this is for the
super enthusiast users it's actually got
a really heavy duty backplate behind the
board and if you're wondering what a
back plate on a board is for it's really
mostly for instances where you've got a
huge amount of torque applied to the
board so these instances would include
using something like a really heavy duty
be quiet cooler that might exceed the
spec of the socket type of what it can
support in terms of force or gram force
whatever applied to the board so that is
one of the reasons another one would be
if you're doing really serious sli or
crossfire maybe three or four way in
those cases all the force from the cards
will definitely apply some nasty torque
to boards and can do some warping over
time so in this way the back plate is
useful with regards the more technical
features these new x 98 motherboards do
all support you too and an MS eyes at
versioning this is called turbo you too
it's a bit boosted I think it can do
about 32 gigabits per second something
like that but you dot 2 uses the PCIe
lanes rather than the SATA HSI oh lanes
from the chipset and pce I Elaine's for
storage are of course much faster this
is where you get things like nvme
through pcie ssds so you two will be
featured on the new msi boards we
already covered it on the new gigabyte
boards that's definitely becoming
thin the next item is USB 3.1 gen2 that
will be on these x99 boards and then the
MSI direction for these boards is also
to introduce what they're calling a
one-click VR not OC one-click VR this is
different from OC genie they will
feature both OC genie and this one click
VR function the VR one specifically does
does actually overclock the CPU because
CPU overclocking has a pretty tremendous
impact on a VR performance right now and
a lot of that is because of the
unoptimized nature of VR games but it
also disables some background tasks
services things you don't need running
it will disable MSI hardware services
like the zero frozer which is when if
the cards under a 60 degrees Celsius
absolute temperature it'll throttle down
the fans to zero in VR mode it doesn't
care about that feature it's just going
to focus on running the fans because you
probably can't hear it if you're in VR
anyways let's look at that auto OC or OC
Genie is still the same as it's pretty
much always Bentley uses a lookup table
or something that extent you does some
testing on the system to check what
hardware you have in the system and that
pretty much covers the new updates for
these things they've all got some kind
of mystic lighting on them and to some
degree or most them do anyway and the
game pro carbon does have more of that
lighting on it because the targeted at
gamers rather than sort of the super
enthusiast market but that that's
everything so that's everything for amis
eyes new x98 motherboards these will be
supporting the broad well II CPUs there
on the chips that you would expect x99
same socket type that we all know so
there you have it check out the previous
video for information on the new twin
frozr 6 cooler where we talked about
some overclocking for the GTX 1080 and
overcoming hurdles with the voltage
control V BIOS and power limitations on
the founders edition card so thanks for
watching patreon link official video on
helps that directly I will see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
