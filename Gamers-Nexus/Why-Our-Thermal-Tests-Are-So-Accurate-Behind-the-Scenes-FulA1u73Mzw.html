accurately testing the thermal output of
cases coolers GPS and CPUs and getting a
measurement that from product to product
is actually representative of the real
world performance without some kind of
variance within the results that may
actually invalidate some of the
differences shown in charts and I am now
confident in saying that I think we have
one of the most accurate and best
testing methodologies for thermals on
the media side of the industry and the
reason I am able to say it with such
excitement and confidence is because we
just validated our own testing
methodology in a real thermal chamber
several thousand dollars this thing we
got access to through a friend and we're
able to use this to see if our results
are actually accurate within a
100-percent controlled environment so
this is something that was pretty unique
to us it was a new experience with
validating our thermal testing
methodology and that's equal parts
nerve-wracking and exciting because
obviously on the one end you could find
out that Oh everything we've been doing
is questionable but we were very happy
to see that the results from the thermal
chamber and our everyday lab setup are
actually almost directly identical with
the cpu load to load tests and the idle
to idle tests and GPU tests they are
right on the dot in terms of accuracy
between each environment so I want to
explain how this all works because it
was pretty cool and I think that the
enthusiasts in the crowd might enjoy
this type of thing so first of all if
you are not familiar with thermal
chambers a thermal chamber is they vary
in size they vary in climate control
abilities some of them have humidity
controls that you can directly access
some of them are just temperature
controls and the whole point of a
thermal chamber is to contain your test
environment and create constants you
know exactly where the intake is know
exactly where the exhaust is in the
system they're often very low powered
fans so there's really no reasonable
impact on test results if you have a
good one and for setups like the one we
use there's actually a lot of extra
thermocouples built into the chamber so
we can position those all over the place
and figure out exactly what is the
temperature of the intake in front of
the intake fan what's the temperature
behind the intake fan what's the
sure of the exhaust what's the
temperature of the CPU if you place one
of these things between the cold plate
and the IHS all this stuff were able to
collect data for and validate our
testing methodology now having years of
experience testing cases I can vary
directly speak to the level of variance
that you can see an environment if
you're not well trained and you don't
have a solid bulletproof methodology for
making sure that the tests are accurate
from day to day even or from case to
case or from season to season there's a
lot of stuff that changes even in a
controlled house and these are only
loosely controlled any kind of office or
house that's on an open-loop HVAC system
or heating and air conditioning system
is going to have variants in the test
results and that needs to be accounted
for by producing Delta values we use
things like this which I'll explain in a
moment to make sure our accurate
readings are achievable by basically
measuring ambient constantly and
checking that against whatever the diode
temperatures are and I'll explain that
more momentarily so a couple of concerns
and challenges with the test engineering
of methodology in a non chamber
environment like this where we do our
testing is you've got to control where
your cases or device it has to be the
same freaking spot every time and I know
it sounds sort of insane that you needed
in the exact same spot from product to
product but it's really it's true
because if you do move the thin the
ambient over there might be cooler or
warmer than the ambient over there and
that might change based on the season
this is the wall that's external so it's
near a window and if I put the case over
there and I've tested this with our
internal testing the result might be
that there's actually a slight few
degree even 12 to warmer temperature
when it's the summer when the Sun is
hitting the wall or when it's winter or
it might just be different because
there's a vent in the ceiling over there
and if you don't position the case
correctly with the intake fan in the
exact same spot every time that intake
or whatever it is heating or air coming
from the ceiling will impact results
that's not good is not a subjunctive
thing it will impact the results and
I've tested that several times at least
in this environment so these are all
very big concerns
the way to deal with it that we've done
is by taking something like this which
is a very accurate basically digital
thermometer that has thermocouples
linked out of it can fit a few of them
in here and we measure every second the
ambient temperature in specific spots
like in front of the intake fan of the
case will occasionally do measurements
of things like the exhaust the output of
the case what does it measure
immediately outside of the rear exhaust
fan what does it measure within the case
between the intake and the GPU and you
can do all these different measurements
and get pretty accurate or actually well
really within point one Celsius
resolution results of the temperature of
wherever that particular thermocouple is
and we use k-type thermocouple so
they're they're rated at these the ones
we use are rated for 800 degrees Celsius
so that helps make sure that these
environments remain accurate so what you
do or what we do i should say is we take
a reading of the ambient we take a
reading of the diode using some software
normally 80 64 and we subtract the
ambient from the diode to create a delta
that delta value shows you the
difference that change from case to case
instead of using an absolute temperature
if it is 21 degrees celsius in here
today and it's 20.5 celsius in here
tomorrow for whatever reason maybe the
AC turned on a few minutes into the test
or something you need to account for
that and the only way to account for
that is with something like this now for
testers and sites or youtube channels
that just check their thermostats you
the thermostat says that's not good
enough and that believe me that is
nowhere near good enough first of all
the thermostats probe might be in the
hallway where the thermostat is that's
not the temperature of this room that is
actually several degrees different from
this room and our other lab or main lab
where all the production and video
rendering happens that's got hot
computers in it's got other electronics
in it that room measures that I don't
know the Celsius reading is measures at
about 84 degrees Fahrenheit depending on
how much work is going on here it'll
measure it may be 68 max 70 Fahrenheit
and in the hallway it might be 67 so
this is all stuff that you can't just
take
a reading from a thermostat and think
it's going to be accurate for a delta
value in a case test and that's why we
introduce these different thermal
couples and stuff we've worked on with
silverstone we worked on with course
share with NZXT all these companies
we've talked to them for years now to
say hey what are the big problems that
we should look for in case testing what
do you guys have trouble with internally
what do you have trouble with externally
with media outlets that you think maybe
aren't doing it 100% correctly or are
doing it correctly and how do we improve
our testing so we did all this we talked
a lot sent back and forth ideas and came
up with the methodologies today which
I'm not going to reveal Foley on camera
but i'll give you the overview of things
to sort of share insight as to why our
tests are accurate so first of all what
were the actual results within the
thermal chamber that we tested in which
again I think they're ten thousand
dollars when we were using which is
really not bad for a thermal chamber but
certainly not something that I can just
throw down and put up in the corner of a
room somewhere so when we used again was
accessed through a contact of mine
several thousand dollars very closely
controlled and the results for that I'm
showing you a chart right now it should
be a chart on the screen the results for
that are almost identical so for the
stock test on the cob like halo 5
silverstone case we saw a difference of
about point zero seven degrees Celsius
from the lab test here and the test in
the thermal chamber that's a very good
thing that means that after we
subtracted the ambient temperature for
this lab and for the thermal chamber we
saw and a readout that had a resolution
of a point one Celsius reading margin of
error with the devices so I read out I
had a point zero seven Celsius
difference between the values so I
basically the same for all intents and
purposes now with our next test with the
bottom intake we saw one I think it was
point 0 46 Celsius again so close it's
just it's it's really exciting how close
the results were and then the biggest
difference we saw was 0 point 2 25
that's a bit larger than the other two
but still pretty damn small difference
between the two and I did talk with the
reason why
that happened we had some access to
other tools we use thermal couples in
different cases or a situation spaces
within the thermal chamber to figure out
why that happened just slightly
different from the other two and it was
because the I had installed a rear
exhaust fan didn't have one stock and
install the rear exhaust fan that was
spitting heat into the wall which was a
couple inches away three inches away so
spitting heat into the thermal chamber
wall and then that heat was
recirculating back into the bottom
getting sucked in below the GPU and that
caused a very very slight increase in
temperature from one test to the next so
that's sort of how we validated
everything at a top level and there's a
lot more concerns too so when designing
these test cases we look at everything
with how close is the wall to the case
is the exhaust facing the wall or is it
facing away where are the vents in the
ceiling on the floor where is the case
positioned exactly in the room what is
the surface of that the case is sitting
on what's the material does the table
run cooler or warmer than ambient on
average depend on what kind of material
it is should almost always be cooler if
you're in the winter anyway that's what
we've experienced and in the summer you
may experience warm it just depends on
sort of where the windows are basically
there's a million things that can change
within a non-controlled thermal chamber
environment and the way we account for
those so like I said this sits there
measuring ambient every second and then
we have the diodes measuring am you at
every second we take this data remove it
from that and then we have a delta value
which gives us accurate results based on
this thermal chamber test so the whole
point of this we use a couple different
tools we use one of these as well this
is a laser you pointed at different
surfaces you get a thermal readout I can
see a table in front of me right now is
17.1 degrees Celsius and using this
device if I had a thermocouple plugged
in which i'll go ahead and do right now
we will see that the ambient temperature
of this room is 19.3 degrees Celsius
where I'm standing right here and that's
17.1 on the table so you can see just
how much the temperature can change from
object object from location in the room
one to the other it's right now we're at
let's see here we are at 18.7 now that's
how
moment to calibrate I put it in front of
this light here and now we are at
nineteen point two and that's an LED
light so that's pretty cool but you can
just see how much things can change and
if you're testing cases these are
products that often maybe have a degree
of difference between them if that so
obviously you've got some margin of
error built in and that will help you
figure out is there a significant
difference between two results one case
the next if they're zero point maybe
zero five zero point zero seven degrees
apart then we know that it's actually
almost within margin of error where they
could effectively be the same and in
terms of practical use they are the same
because your CPU and your GPU don't care
that much about one degree but within
the world of cool and it's also a unique
challenge for these manufacturers
because cooling is the type of thing
with computers anyway we're ASA texts
and cool it's and all these a politics
all these companies of the world they
are trying to compete with one another
for maybe one degree at a time it's a
big deal if you can drop your
temperatures by one degree Celsius so
that's why this accurate testing is
useful because even though it's
practically not that different we can
still see what is the absolute best
product in each category within a slight
margin of error built in there what is
the best product we can rank them in a
hierarchy and then we can talk about it
in the article and in the videos hey how
does this impact you practically and
sometimes there's a pretty damn big
difference so if you have one case it
might be we test the revolt to leave all
to was what was it I think it was almost
30 degrees Celsius I want to say warmer
on the 980 TI hybrid GPU than when we
tested it on an open bench so that is a
giant difference and that just shows why
the accurate testing is important for
finding those types of things now other
tools we use we do use multimeters as
well this is a bit more involved then
probably a lot of sites think is
necessary but I do it just as a
precaution so this is especially
something we do for testing fan
controllers and that's because fan
controllers if they're cheap they don't
output a constant voltage they might
fluctuate even from something like 11 12
volts
the high speed setting so that's a
pretty fair fluctuation i will drop your
rpm a good bit so we use multimeters to
sit there and read out with probes
during testing or after testing what I
ever read out what is the voltage
throughput what's the the current and
all that stuff and that's something that
we use to help validate as well we use
this to check the temperature in a
couple different spots do spot checks
and then we use this for ambient put it
on a spreadsheet do a bit of work there
crunch the numbers and count with the
charts that you all have become familiar
with so that was the adventure of
testing all this stuff in a thermal
chamber some of the photos should have
gone through during this time if you
have any questions let me know in the
comments below I'm pretty pretty happy
to see that the testing methodology is
accurate that its sound and next we are
working on DB testing some noise testing
I've said this many times actually in
every article about cases lately and
it's for good reason so we don't
currently test noise and that's because
it's really hard to test knows you need
to know some math about how the decibel
levels work need to know some math about
the deltas and it's logarithmic it's not
just a simple subtraction formula if you
add more fans it's a logarithmic change
in the noise output so that's my next
goal is to start adding DB tests and
we're going to buy some expensive
equipment after we talked to a couple of
manufacturers figure out what's what's
good for our purposes I'm not going to
go build a half-a-million-dollar
anechoic chamber that's just absurd
frankly I just want to do the best test
we possibly can within a realistic real
world everyday environment and hopefully
over the next few months figure out a
methodology that is so accurate and
reproducible that we know definitively
from case to case GPGPU which one's
quieter and even if that's in a somewhat
relative setting so I'm not building any
anechoic chambers I do have access to
them and we're going to be validating
our methodology and those as well when
the time comes so i will be able to use
those zero DB noise floor anechoic
chambers and figure out if we set up a
case in here how loud is it and no
absolutely how loud it is and then set
it up in a lab environment in our lab
this one and figure out okay what's our
noise floor how loud is the case here
and how do we compute that
elta to figure out one to the next
what's louder especially because things
like noise can change on a day-to-day
basis see there's all kamillion more
concerns there does your air
conditioning turn on that's a noise
increase is there a train going by is
there a plane there's a car on the
street driving by all kinds of small
things can impact noise testing it is a
nightmare to get into and do accurately
but now that we've conquered thermal at
least the Psalms agree i'm not going to
say we're the best at thermal dynamics
there is because it's not really what we
do we're not thermal engineers just test
engineers so I am pretty confident that
we've basically conquered that problem
in terms of measuring thermal i will say
that but DB is next and that's going to
be a very big challenge but i'm excited
to tackle it and for anyone who wants to
help us all this stuff it is expensive
to do so I you know there's sponsors
that definitely helps and then we've got
patreon link to the postural video or in
the description below if you want to
help us out directly but other than that
just watch the content if you like it
then great please comment stuff like
that all the usual youtube BS people
spew you know like comment subscribe
what it actually does help but thank you
for watching the discussion on how this
stuff works and behind the scenes of
what we're doing to make sure our tests
are accurate and not just I frankly
excuse but not just that people
post up with some kind of half-assed you
know check the thermostat and subtract
that or even worse just post absolute
values where you might have a
temperature fluctuation I mean we've
with this thing let's see what it is now
it is now it's now 19.1 here and here a
minute ago it was I think it went from
18.3 at 1.2 19.1 over there it's like
19.2 and that has increased as well so
just standing here has increased the
heat of the room the lights and you know
I the point is that there's got to be
some kind of science behind how you
account for that and that's what we do
and that's what we do pretty well so
thank you for watching I will hopefully
see you in the next video where we talk
about some more product stuff and news
and yeah I'll see you all next time
thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
