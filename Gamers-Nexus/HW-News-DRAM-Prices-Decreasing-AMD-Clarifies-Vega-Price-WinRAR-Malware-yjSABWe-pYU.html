hardware news recap for the week we have
information about vacant 56 pricing will
be following up on our hashtag something
positive campaign that we started the
charity drive and talking about
malicious vulnerabilities that have been
in WinRAR for 14 years now since 2005 I
was probably still playing Jedi Knight
Jedi Academy at that point using WinRAR
regularly DRAM oversupply potentially
causing prices to continue to downtrend
which would be great to see and more
before that this video is brought to you
by the power color red dragon rx 588
gigabyte card the RX 580 red dragon is a
good fit for 1080p and 1440p gaming
priced very competitively at $170 and
including two free games from AMD like
the division 2 or Resident Evil 2
the red dragon series got a big name on
our channel when we pushed the vegam 56
red dragon to the limits but it's now
available at lower prices with the RX
588 gigabyte and rx 574 gigabytes the
latter of which is presently a $130
while the promo lasts learn more at the
links below so first up the something
positive hashtag that we started was in
response to a tweet from somebody in the
industry we'll leave that there and I'll
name the heavyweights that jumped in
there the those from our industry I
didn't see a hundred percent of the
tweets because there were literally
hundreds of them and I looked through as
many as I could I think I looked through
all of them but every time I started
scrolling through Twitter on that
hashtag the top would refresh and say
like 100 new tweets so I'm not sure if
it showed me all of them I think I saw
them all but anyway Paul jumped in there
so Paul from Paul's hardware he wanted
to outdo how to me in donations I wanted
to outdo Kyle if we're gonna be
competitive over donations to charity I
guess that's about the best that you can
be competitive over so Paul showing that
he is smarter than both Kyle and me
jumped in there and I gave thirteen
thirty seven dollars so 1337 of course
referenced elite Paul and I are Bolivar
we're both fluent and leet speak this is
actually it's how we normally
communicate to each other when we're at
shows and Kyle gave a thousand dollars
to a charity as well to eating
reforestation projects which we gave
1272 and then our community
impressively outdid all of us so how did
all of us combined in fact it's it's
incredible and heartwarming to see but
if you want some good news I guess if
you want something uplifting you can
check the hashtag something positive the
hashtag on Twitter and see all of the
donations from the community to various
charities so I think it was over $7,000
that's where I stopped tally and did my
best to tally but every time I scrolled
the top of the page refresh and say like
160 new tweets so I'm not sure Twitter
showed me all of them but either way I
was able to add up about $7,000 of
donations to charities from our
community so first of all that's amazing
thank you for showing how good the PC
enthusiasts community can be between
spats over which one of these is the
best and some of the charities donated
to we asked you to just give to
whichever one you felt personally you
felt strongly about and even
reforestation projects which is the one
that I gave to received a lot éä fevicol
organization on ik Frontier Foundation a
really good organization very fitting
for the topic of copyright which by the
way YouTube has changed its system on
that now but that's a different story
Doctors Without Borders water.org PKD
foundation to fight kidney disease
longevity norris lifts ambulance an
oncological a foundation or a couple of
them actually super Dan gave food to a
homeless shelter sick kids vs Brain
Injury Association of America Black Dog
Institute books for keeps and a whole
lot more so it's incredible work and a
lot of good choices by the community and
yeah I mean thanks for joining in and
doing the hashtag something positive of
course you can do that all the time but
it's more fun when you can I guess join
the community and do something
collectively good so anyway check out
Paul and Kyle if you don't know who Paul
or Kyle are it would be Kyle and Paul
read Paul's hardware and I mean I'll
leave that story there but you can check
out the Twitter page for that hashtag if
you want some uplifting news
AMD clarifies vegam 56 pricing so in our
news in our review of the 1660 tii that
was legitimate I actually had the look
editor of the name that was not that was
not acting in our review it's been a
long night of the 1660 ti we talked
about vagin 56 pricing potentially get
adjusted and so did several other
outlets this is because A&amp;amp;E sent out a
news blast before the launch of the card
that indicated the current pricing and
some game bundles and so AMD clarified
they sent us a note and said radeon RX
vega 56 has been heavily promoted since
the holidays and into the new year as
partners have been eager to make rxwiki
56 and its forward that's not how you
use an apostrophe in its and its
forward-looking eight gigabytes of HP m2
available for more gamers to clarify the
current Radeon rx Vega 56 promotion is
not a price drop additionally the rx
Vega 56 card will continue to be offered
as part of the eighth of an these raise
the game fully loaded bundle with three
of this year's blockbuster titles so I
want to clarify there that the
clarification statement that's that's
their use of an apostrophe on possessive
it's not mine but anyway on so the price
is not I guess firmly adjusting we
didn't email them back and clarify so
are the lower prices we're seeing right
now going back up or what's the deal and
we didn't really get a great response
right like I don't know what the
response means so Rx bacon 56 comes with
three games I guess is the takeaway here
free games as it were and the promotion
is not a price drop I guess the idea
being that the card is supposed to stay
around $280 or less and has been there
or it might go back up it depends on the
partner models I think because some of
the cards you'll see are still over $300
and those might not move it sounds like
based on what this is saying but anyway
there's your update from AMD Vega with
u6 of course to clarify is a great card
for overclocking enthusiasts if you just
want to play around with hardware that's
pretty unlock it's not fully unlocked
but it's better in terms of overclocking
mods that don't require hard mods then
Nvidia's offerings then Vega 56 it's
still good for that the sixteen sixty Ti
is fiercely competitive and depending on
if Vega 56 actually stays around the
price that AMD I guess is clarifying it
is not a permanent price drop then it's
it's a tough competition I mean Vega 56
if it's a partner model card especially
like the red dragon for example which I
mentioned because
our charts if it's 280 $300 as a partner
model then that's that's pretty
compelling buy do you Rama oversupply
this is also pretty good news so PC and
Server DRAM looks like it will continue
to see these sharp declines it's been
seen over the past couple of months now
so DRAM if you're kind of new to the PC
market you weren't around building a
computer and maybe 2016 or so then you
missed the lowest memory prices that I
think we've ever seen since
so DRAM was something like $50 for eight
gigabytes of at the time high-speed
memory and it was like 70 for 16
gigabytes so prices are finally coming
back down and the latest market analysis
by DRAM exchange which is the most
reliable source for this stuff the
company stated that they continued to
oversupply in the DRAM market will lead
to price declines and serve a dram by as
much as 30% and it looks like there
could be a 20% decline for PC Ram which
would be us for first quarter 2019
additionally the oversupply is expected
to perpetuate through the second half of
2019 at least DRAM exchange also states
of the oversupply and weak demand are
still affecting the market and will
continue to do so in second quarter of
2019 where PC DRAM the pc dr mark you
can see a 15 percent
quarter-over-quarter reduction in price
on top of the current reductions were
seen and meanwhile the price declines
are not expected to moderate first
modulates for a server diriomo until at
least third quarter of 2019 as selling
off excessive inventories becomes vital
at that point so by the end of 2019 we
could see year over year price drops
approaching 50 percent which is great
news for the PC enthusiasts and PC
building space malicious vulnerability
hiding in WinRAR staking out for 14
years now since 2005 when rara is of
course one of the most popular file
compression and decompression utilities
it is very commonly is one of the first
things that a lot of people in our
audience I'm assuming would install on
their computers and recently when rar
announced that it has patched a
vulnerability that's existed for about
14 years so this potentially puts 500
million users at risk but
got a specific use case here so the
potential attack vector was discovered
by checkpoint software and the short
version of this very long story is that
winrar supported the outdated AC II
archive format and this support of the
AC II archive format was to blame when
rar has since dropped support of the AC
format so if you update you will lose
that support but also the vulnerability
will be gone and when ro are noted in a
statement that first of all they thanked
checkpoint software for finding the
vulnerability and informing WinRAR of it
and secondly they noted that it's a
vulnerability in the U n AC ev2 dll
library which WinRAR has no source code
control over it was a third-party
library and so when rar has updated to
drop a C II archive support and has
resolved the issue as a result so if
this concerns you might want to update
WinRAR all state acquires I cracked yes
all that all state the insurance company
acquires I cracked as a right to repair
vector I guess a lie in a sort of
surprising move Allstate Insurance
announced that its acquired I cracked
one of the largest independent
smartphone repair companies in the u.s.
it was purchased through all states
SquareTrade subsidiary I cracked will
now join SquareTrade which offers
extended protection plans and tactical
support you've probably seen SquareTrade
when you buy technical products like
cameras for example on Amazon or
elsewhere it is one of the most
prevalent warranty programs for
electronics this acquisition will
presumably allow SquareTrade to extend
its services by allowing customers to
use I cracked who offer on-demand and
on-site repair services more importantly
however is what the right to repair
movement stands to gain from acquiring
an ally in the fourth largest us
insurance provider and this coincides
with iFixit in their push for supporting
right to repair laws right now and more
than 40% of the u.s. writes repair laws
are up for discussion we actually made a
short video on Twitter talking about
right to repair working with iFixit on
that so this is a big topic right now
the executive director of repair org
told motherboard that quote allstate has
been very helpful to us and noted that
allstate has also assisted behind the
scenes sort of in New Hampshire and
where we're right to repair laws
legislation proposals are up for
discussion I think that's HB 462 in New
Hampshire if you live there and are
interested I fix it of course spoke to
motherboard as well and talked about the
eye cracks and all state partnership and
you can find more of that on the iFixit
blog if you want to read about that I
think I fixed that org is talking about
this specifically so a few weeks ago
news broke that TSMC was dealing with
production issues at its fab 14 in
southern Taiwan at the time there was a
disruption of wafer production there was
contamination of wafers and of silicon
and wafers had to be thrown away as a
result so there's a bad batch of
photoresist chemicals that caused the
damage at the time details are scarce we
didn't really know the wide reach and
impact of this or if there even was one
but TSMC was potentially facing
thousands of scraps wafers now TSMC has
detailed the financial impact of the
disruption to its production lines and
tsmc noted that it will lower its first
quarter 2019 guidance as the photoresist
incident is expected to cost the SMC as
much as five hundred and fifty million
dollars in revenue for quarter one
additionally gross margins will see a
2.6 percent reduction as well as a 3.6
percent drop in operating margins the
wafers lost in the first quarter will be
made up for in second quarter of 2019
TSMC stated that the photoresist
chemicals from its unnamed supplier
contained abnormally treated components
resulting in the creation of a foreign
polymer they said creating an adverse
effect on 12 nanometer and 16 nanometer
wafers eventually damaging and
destroying them to a point where they
couldn't be used so it's a bit of an
anomaly and doesn't count towards normal
yield but was one that impacted their
bottom line nonetheless see SMC stated
quote it has maintained constant
communication with affected customers
and has worked out replacement and
delivery schedules with each of them
Intel buys in NATO systems so in a move
to flesh out its continued foray into
GPUs Intel has purchased annada systems
which works with autonomous vehicle
products for an undisclosed all-cash
deal according to The Times of India
Intel is less interested in the actual
products of this company and more
interested in its employees Intel is
looking to acquire or
about a hundred of the engineers from
the company into its GPU team to
continue to grow its team intel issued a
statement Tom's Hardware saying Intel
acquired engineering resources from a
native systems a silicon and platform
services provider this transaction
provides Intel with an experienced SOC
team to help build a world-class
discrete GPU business and Intel's been
on sort of a tear lately with all of its
everything so Intel's been working on
fab discussion of expansion in Israel
are working on expansion actively in
Oregon talking about expansion in
Ireland I believe was the other one
so it's it's sort of its booming
everywhere in the GPU side of things
attired Raja Kaduri Jim Keller Chris
Hook and others former AMD employees and
plans to roll out its graphics brand for
data center in gaming and probably 2020
so we'll see about that but NZXT is aged
500 overwatch addition we have one of
these we're doing a build with it just
for some fun but it's an H 500 which is
actually a pretty good case we reviewed
it positively and actually a contrary to
its negative pressure setup it did
perform pretty well too so NZXT is
working with Blizzard to make another
game themed case for overwatch as part
of its craft series CRF t NZXT is not a
fan actually of vowels
that's why build is just B LD to them
and craft is CR ft I guess I guess I was
gonna make a joke about NZXT name but I
guess it already doesn't have any vowels
so the overwatch Edition should sell for
about 150 bucks it's a bit bit of an
upcharge but it is different theme so
we'll be looking at it just for some fun
you can check it out on Angie X T's
website if you want to see it two more
quick horns to talk about here this one
so quick for note we're not a hundred
percent sure of the accuracy of this
story it's sort of a rumor sort of a
retailer leak but sometimes the prices
that retailers list the head of launches
are placeholders so this story may prove
inaccurate please note that going into
it
European retailers have been listing new
Pentium and Celeron chips that we
haven't heard of before including AG
56:20 and others like a Pentium Golda G
54 20 and these are supposed to 4
gigahertz chips the points of interest
would be a higher frequency and that's
about it
so we don't know firm prices or
frequencies but it looks like they
should be over 4 gigahertz and then
finally overclockers UK offering a
$46,000 PC and it's not it's it's well
it's called the Orion x2 PC and it's an
ultra premium PC which is built into
overclocked by former world record
overclocker turned to system builder 8
pack and 8 pack we have worked with at
events like Computex he's often with
their Bower with Stefan Z the other guy
is typically up on stage talking about
something so can often be spotted near G
skills overclocking competitions at
Computex - anyway the Orion x2 comes
housed in the fantex enthu elites
chassis it contains twin systems it's
got a primary system with an Intel 790
DX e 2 or 3 water-cooled
Titan our T X's 128 gigabytes of 32
hundred megahertz Ram secondary system
offers either an Intel night ahead of K
or 9700 K combined with a water-cooled
Titan RT X as well or 20 atti if you're
poor yeah that was a joke to be clear
from other boards the primary system
uses the X 299 Asus Rampage 6 extreme
Omega Edition EA T X and the secondary
system uses in our og Strix d39 TI
gaming mini ITX motherboard both of the
builds are powered by an eight-pack
edition of super flowers 2 kilowatt
power supply and then the orion x2 is
cooled by three independent water
cooling loops with a whole slew of
radiators fans pumps reservoirs and
acrylic flow plates the system is
configurable up to 46 grand if you're
interested in it maybe just go over
there and check it out for fun just just
to see what it would be like I'm
sincerely curious if any mmm I don't
think anyone's gonna spend that much but
I'm sure he will buy it but we'll see if
it's for $50,000 or nearly and that's
after shipping and taxes and everything
so that's it for this one go to stored
on cameras axis dotnet topside directly
or patreon.com slash cameras next is
we're gonna push a behind-the-scenes
video over there I think today went
demand when this goes up
and subscribe for more I'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
