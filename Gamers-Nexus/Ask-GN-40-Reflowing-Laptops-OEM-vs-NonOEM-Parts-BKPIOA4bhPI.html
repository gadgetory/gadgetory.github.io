of ask GN finally back from CES working
on some follow-up CPU testing for KB
Lake and other CPU so do stay tuned for
that the questions as always if you have
them leave them in the comments below
I'll try to get them for the next
episode this week we have a couple that
are wordy but I think we can get through
them somewhat quickly I'm still waiting
on responses from intel on a few
previous questions we sent them they've
been a bit slow getting the answers
really anything that they do acknowledge
all of the questions I guess that's a
start
before we get into the questions this
video is brought to you by cyber power
and there's cyber XL gaming PC which has
the invertible motherboard tray layout
and a couple of other cool features with
the polycarbonate side panel and lights
of course check the link in the
description below for more information
on that the first question this week is
from Tim Tom T Chris who says question
for Steve many motherboards I have
different connections like for your
mouse USB stick or other device audio
ports etc does the quality of signal
suffer when devices are connected
directly into your motherboard into your
keyboard rather does a mouse latency
increase USB Drive transfer speed and
decrease audio quality worsen is it
better to connect to your motherboard
instead the one I haven't tested here is
USB Drive speed that'd be kind of
interesting but generally the so those
ports on keyboards and know what you're
talking about they're normally called
pass throughs so the Logitech I think
that Jesus 710 plus or something a lot
of them but that one especially comes to
mind use two USB headers out of the
keyboard and one of those connects into
a slot and your motherboard and
basically just passes it through to the
keyboard so you should have full
bandwidth that shouldn't be a problem at
least if you're doing it that way where
there's two USB headers on the board the
keyboard connecting into the motherboard
then you you do pass that signal through
the potential I suppose downside would
be latency technically if you plug into
the keyboard it's got to go through one
extra layer to get to the motherboard so
there could be an increase in latency
there whether or not it's relevant I
haven't actually tested that would be
kind of interesting but I don't have the
tools to test that and
in a way that would be repeatable and
accurate one thing not just kind of in
general I do prefer to plug my mouse and
my keyboard directly into the
motherboard and then if there's a
pass-through on the keyboard I'll use it
for something else I have had issues
with several keyboards in the past where
they'll drop signal now and then to the
USB device so I would not want that to
happen to a mouse while I'm gaming
because you just lose signal for a
second and have no movement well you
also don't want to happen to a USB key
so it's not a lot of good options there
most of them are fine truth be told in
terms of connectivity but I've had
enough issues with some of the earlier
samples of the usb pastors on keyboards
that I just generally try to avoid them
for anything critical at this point
other than maybe a USB key that's not
gonna do a whole lot of them transfer
files for a few seconds to answer your
question I don't have a hard number for
you
latency would increase because you are
going through another layer if if not
digitally definitely at least physically
you've got more travel but again that
could be totally insignificant and from
sort of just hands-on use I don't know
that I've really noticed any Mouse speed
decreases from connecting to the mouth
of the keyboard but just because I
wouldn't want to drop connection and
because I guess to some extent maybe I
was gaming the superstition or something
I would rather have my mouse plugged
directly into the motherboard the next
question is from apple maggot that's a
lovely thing haha
a boo maggot says question I have a
Toshiba laptop l 675 D that has failed
and needs a reflow or reball of the
video chip what is your experience with
this xbox360 had the same red rain of
death that was solved with reflow and
third-party cooling and has since turned
into a cottage industry due to laptops
having inferior cooling solutions there
seem to be four solutions the oven
reflow heat gun reflow professional
reball with new graphics chip for $120
on a 17 inch laptop so Louis rossman I
think as his name has a really good
video on this and
it was directed at Linus from - tech
tips because Linus did a reflow video
some time ago Louis is an experienced
repair technician mostly works on Mac
units but has done enough with reflowing
things and actually soldering things to
fix them to know what's up soldering and
rhe flowing normally you're going to
reflow something because the solder has
micro fractures in it as Lewis said it's
not a permanent solution this is
something that if it works you get a
couple months out of it and then the
problem comes back to a more permanent
form so this I would not recommend using
an oven to reflow your video card or
your GPU or laptop one it could go wrong
and two if it works it's temporary so if
there's no other action I guess you
could do it to try and get data off of
there but you can still just pull the
drive anyway hopefully and just recover
the drive through an external enclosure
connected to a PC or something like that
so I don't know that I would really
recommend reflow in it maybe maybe if
you have no other good options and you
need to get an extra couple months maybe
one to three months out of the thing
before you upgrade maybe it's worth
doing but check out Lewis Rothman's
video and it's he's got a pretty good
one and Linus actually revisited him in
New York City where he works and they
did a follow up video where they
actually tried to reflow some stuff or
properly restore some some equipment so
that's a bit educational but generally I
would not recommend it my experience
with it is very little and I am NOT an
expert on it and I don't think that
anyone who isn't an expert on it should
be doing it either
because really you're only good option
is to actually properly replace the chip
and that's normally not worth it on a
laptop unless it's an MX M card anyway
that you can kind of just swap if you
can get a professional to do it like
you're saying for 120 bucks and they're
actually going to properly reball the
GPU rather than reflow it then that's
not a bad price I don't know how old
that laptop is but I might be worth
considering I
would do that before sticking it enough
and I think exiled storm asks my
question is what is the difference
between an OEM CPU 6,700 cavers om 6700
K and why do they usually cost more
money than a standard version so the OEM
CPU is normally I think on Amazon or
Newegg one of them recently I was
talking normally when it's listed as om
the I don't know about the case keys for
skylight because they don't come with
CPU coolers but traditionally om has
meant that it they removed the box
anything in the box other than the CPU
and I sell you a straight CPU and my
idea is that it should be cheaper not
more expensive kind of like how any
other OEMs of anything like Windows is
going to be a bit cheaper because idea
is that it's sold to system integrators
who then pass it on to a customer and
can do so at a reduced cost for the
product the 6700 case specifically I
haven't looked into but generally it's
an absence of a CPU cooler and absence
of manuals or the box and things like
that
don't think it should cost more because
it's not going to give you anything
special the next question is well and
quick note if you saw it on Amazon their
prices are all over the place anyway so
that might be why a next question is
from Rodney Rogers he says how easy
would you say it is to revive a not
working graphics card how can you tell
it's the dye and not something you can
repair with soldering I would say that
it is very not easy to repair now
working video card this goes into the
this the reflow in question just pulling
out a soldering iron and applying it to
parts on the GPU isn't gonna fix it
especially if it's the dye there has to
be something really specific that you
can recognize and understand how it
works and how it's connected to the PCB
and what its job is to to make anything
work with the soldering iron so
generally with video cards unless it's
something really expensive you're out of
warranty the manufacturers not going to
help you at all retailers not going to
help you at all
if that's the case and it's maybe a six
or seven
our video card I guess would be worth
looking into I have no idea where to
tell you to start because it's not what
I do but I would have to imagine that
pain a professional to do that would
cost close to a new card and probably
had just be better to get a new card so
the answer how easy it is to revive a
dysfunctional card would be not easy the
best thing to do probably is to just do
some basic troubleshooting so plug it
into a different system see if it works
it doesn't work that well try different
ports as well hdmi displayport TV i use
all of them see what happens you can do
some testing with the different monitor
just to make sure it's not the monitor
that's broken those are all the things I
would do first after that point if
you're really desperate and there's
nothing else to do it might be worth
opening the thing up and seeing if
there's anything really obvious and
that's wrong like for example if the GPU
heatsink is applied incorrectly or
something like that and the card is just
refusing to function because it's
running too hot too quick or something
but I yeah again not really worth sort
of reflowing or soldering anything
unless you really know what you're doing
and can identify the problem quickly and
I can't that's not what I do
so the next question is from super goody
I'm planning to build my first PC soon
I'm planning to use the i3 6100
concerned about my options question KB
Lake has the 1151 socket like skylake so
could you use a KB Lake processor on a
motherboard designated for skylake I've
seen that there needs to be a BIOS
update if one were to do that how would
I go about that I plan to buy the be 150
I gain Pro AC wood MSI released an
update for this that's on MSI yes you
can sort of mix and match cable akin
skylake processors and motherboards to
an extent check the board manufacturers
website a lot of them have been pretty
eager in releasing BIOS updates MSI
included for some of their boards I've
seen them for MSI ACS gigabytes I think
as rock as well a couple I'm sure almost
all of them at this point have done that
they released BIOS updates they are for
specific motherboards so you can't just
take a BIOS update from MSI's what
our gaming Pro carbon or something and
apply it to whatever it is you want to
buy it has to be specifically for that
board it would be listed if you type in
what do you by MSI be 150 I game Pro AC
drivers that would take you to MSI site
click the support button download go to
BIOS see if there's a BIOS update that
has the compatibility patch that you
want and then you would download it and
install it through this depends
manufacturer manufacturer you install it
either through an exe that you just run
from the desktop or you put it on a
flash drive restart boot into BIOS go to
some easy flash utility pick the drive
pick the file and tell it to load and
then it will flash your BIOS it needs to
be compatible you can't lose power
during this because anything like that
would potentially brick the motherboard
and you might not be able to get it to
turn on again keep that in mind it is
pretty easy so I don't don't want to
scare anyone away but just make sure
everything looks good
the short answer how do you know if a
board will support it check their
website they will definitely tell you if
it does support any kind of forward
compatibility with KB Lake because
that's a feature to brag about so they
would let you know it's not hard to do
if they do though the next question is
from name I can't pronounce will just go
with my cutie coca I suppose I apologize
question is I liked I would like to know
if aftermarket blower GPU is like MSI
arrow and the issues turbo are any
better than referenced founded edition
in terms of cooling and sound Emma
didn't blow our Styles because of my
case this I'd like to know if it's
better to go with aftermarket coolers or
reference and yes so it depends on the
fan and the heatsink because the blower
cooler itself based there are different
types of blower fan just like there are
different types of radial fans and there
gonna be a different qualities the
founders edition fan to give NVIDIA
credit where it's due
is actually pretty high-end they used a
good fan it doesn't cool very well in
terms of the rest of the GPU but it's a
good fan the and when I say it doesn't
cool very well I mean compared
two aftermarket solutions like the dual
radial fans or axial fans rather and
insert so is it good it depends on you
look up a teardown for the cards you're
looking at the MSI arrow I don't really
like to be honest but if you look up a
teardown you'll want to look at the
heatsink itself so as the heatsink
better than or equal to the founders
Edition heatsink if it is then and it's
cheaper then it might be a better card
to buy just because it's cheaper has the
same cooler heatsink you want to pay
attention to finding city doesn't have a
copper base plate or aluminum does it
have a vapor chamber or copper heat
pipes or anything like that and they'll
tell you all of those things or they
should in their marketing materials and
then you just have to find sites that
have torn it apart
I haven't torn apart either of those
specific cards I am NOT a big fan of the
MSI Aero card I did use that but didn't
tear it down well I guess we sort of
didn't tear it down with the Seahawk the
Corsair an MSI Seahawk mostly the same
card but yes so yeah they can be better
or worse than founders edition
absolutely it just depends on if they
used a better or worse fan and heatsink
and the fan for the founders editions
pretty good so if they have a better
heat sink on the aftermarket card it
might be better but the fan that's gonna
be harder to beat a Massiah it's not a
big fan of Asus I have no experience
with that specific card and then oh also
it's kind of worth noting this the PCB
layout is also important so if you're
using basically a reference PCB with a
modified cooler it normally means
they've gone with a cheaper cooler
cheaper fan cheaper heatsink and they've
stuck with the Nvidia reference PCB if
that happens it's gonna be a worst card
overall in terms of cooling specifically
unless they run a higher fan rpm profile
which is definitely possible and the
piece of you if it's aftermarket they
might have added to the vrm so it might
have more phases if that's the case
you're spreading heat out over a larger
area which is important and that could
reduce your temperature as well so it
just depends on the specific card
there's no yes X is better than Y for
this question
next question is motherboard airflow is
it a myth for some water cooling builds
having the radiators in some locations
without case fans it's clearly going to
give you great temperatures on CB and
GPU but no real airflow over the vrm is
etc on the motherboard
where you'd usually have case fans
blowing air over them and then goes on
to say that they're building a water
cooling system and that's the concern
yeah there's it's not a myth motherboard
airflow matters but VRMs can get really
hot and go over a hundred C easily and
pretty much every case on a motherboard
that doesn't mean you should he
shouldn't try the to that but I
generally wouldn't worry if you're doing
some serious overclocking maybe put a
fan pointed directly at the vrm is
depending on how serious the serious
overclocking is because if it's actually
really extreme like builds I'd would do
then you're gonna go with something like
with liquid nitrogen or dry ice or
something like that or Peltier cooler
but yeah a lot of the VR M's like for
the was that board reviewed the RS game
in seven the Z 270 board the VR m4 that
you could probably run it without a
heatsink even on the motherboard because
they're really not going to get that hot
especially with the new Intel stuff they
just don't tax the tax of erm that
heavily so I would not worry about it
too much now if you're putting your
system in a box where there's zero
airflow and your fans aren't gonna push
any air anywhere near the motherboard
I'd probably put a fan in there pointed
at the board just to help get rid of the
heat even if it's at a low rpm like 800
rpm just because sitting heat makes me
nervous in a computer and the memory is
going to generate heat the PCH generates
Heat
when you're doing i/o and of course the
vrm around the cpu the GPU vrm on the
motherboard all that stuff generates
heat at some level so having still air
is not something I like I would put a
low rpm fan in there and then hopefully
that can just kind of keep it
circulating enough that your liquid
cooling radiators
and their fans can get rid of whatever
heat is sitting in the case but yeah not
a huge deal but definitely not something
to just completely ignore in all use
cases either so that is it for this
episode there's a ton of CES coverage on
