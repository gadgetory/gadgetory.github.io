ask GN as always there are a lot of good
questions last week won't be getting to
all of them but if you have questions
that weren't asked or we're asked and we
skip to post them below I'll try and hit
it for the next episode getting started
here first off the question of notes
from the the first viewer is about AMD
in their new RX series this is actually
pretty topical right now Don joe says
hey steve md said in there are x 480
presentation that polaris 10 / 11 will
feature cards with the price range of
100 to 300 dollars since the RX 480 is
199 to two hundred thirty dollars do you
think the three hundred dollar card is
the 490 do you think you can challenge
gtx 1070 or could it possibly be better
so first of all just because the range
is one hundreds of 300 I don't think
that means there has to be a
three-hundred-dollar card now that's not
saying there isn't or won't be one but i
think that's plain to the marketing
language of we're making something
that's 230 or two hundred fifty dollars
and trying to keep it at a cleaner
number now that said the 490 certainly
could exist I don't have any inclination
what it would be right now from any
official sources I'm sure there's rumors
out there I try not to to buy into those
too much because one if the rumors are
accurate and legitimate it means that
they've been leaked past NDA's and
that's bad for everybody or to their
complete BS and made up so I don't know
anything about the 490 if it does exist
I I really I have no good speculation
for you about the three out of dollar
range now that said I do think that part
of the the 300 number is just to include
the 8 gigabyte model the RX for 80 notes
that maybe this is something useful for
you Polaris is not meant to be a
high-end competitor Andy is not trying
to release a halo product which
basically means a flagship product with
Polaris there reserving that for Vega or
viga and Polaris is really just
targeting power efficiency and
affordability that's all they're going
for with
Swan they are targeting laptops as
you'll see in our recent news video we
did from the e3 announcement but none of
these things are really getting heavily
pushed towards a fury ex equivalent or
for 90 x or 3 90 x equivalents or
anything like that so I would not expect
a high end GPU to ship with Polaris or a
big Polaris chip to exist it just it's
not what they built the architecture for
and we'll have more information for you
that on that as the review embargoes
lift I'm sure next question is Charlie
waffles who says not sure if this has
been asked before but how likely are
these clothes that loop corsair water
coolers to leak what's their average
lifespan so the first of all liquid
coolers we did a video about this you
can search the channel for who makes
your liquid coolers I think so liquid
coolers the ones by Corsair by NZXT
thermaltake in almost every single
instance the actual maker of the liquid
cooler is someone like ASA tech or cool
it cool I tea or Swift tech or someone
like that aqua tuning so there's the
actual suppliers of the liquid that
means that Coursera NZXT for instance
actually use the same supplier and the
same model and the same unit all the way
down to almost everything is up for tube
length for the most part in some of
their liquid cooling products so what
I'm saying here for corsair and their
summits on their product line will apply
to other folks who use the same supplier
the one that I know if the top of my
head is a Sutekh ASA text liquid coolers
that coarser uses and that NZXT uses
currently anyway are rated for about
five years of use or five years of
existence anyway I'm not sure how they
do if you were to buy one keep it on a
shelf for five years but five years of
use certainly after that point it's
actually it's not leakage that you're
worried about the the question here very
specifically says do they leak or how
likely are they to leak it's not that
they start leaking or they shouldn't
anyway if they
you need to call on the warranty what
happens is the liquid actually starts
sort of permeating the tubes depending
on that there's different types of tubes
so there's some tubes that are more
rigid and plasticky like the ones used
on the fury X there's tubes that are
more rubbery like the ones that ace
attack uses and a lot of their active
coolers that are out there and so
depending on that material there's a
different type of will call it entropy
of the liquid just for sake of ease so
in the case of these rubber tubes
what'll generally happen is over the
period of five years the liquid will
start permeating that rubber or that
material and so now you've introduced
some air to the system the pump has to
work harder to push the Sam out of
liquid it'll be less efficient at coulon
there's less liquid so that means that
there's it generally will have a higher
temperature the liquid temperature
itself will be higher that means your
components get warm or so you keep an
eye on the component temperature and
that will give you a good indication of
life span but the answer is about five
years for liquid so if you're building
something that you want to kind of put
in a closet and access in 10 years I
would suggest an air cooler just because
those don't really fail and the fans if
you put it away the barians will
probably still be fine so that's
hopefully that answers most of that
they're just plenty more to it but
that's that's the basics next question I
want to keep this one short is from
cyborg in 1994 who asks how accurate is
PZ part Pickers wat amount on a part
list how close to the water mount can I
get away with I actually don't use pc
part picker because I don't need to but
I will say I can't comment on how
accurate their what reading is but
generally what you can do and this is
the best way to stay up to date on this
stuff is look at reviews of really just
the GPU and the CPU that you're planning
to buy the rest of the components are
pretty inconsequential with their wat
draw look at those two components
specifically and find reviews where
they've done power testing we do power
tests and almost every review we we
publish now and that will give you an
idea for total system power
when using that component and then you
can look at Delta values so you can look
at device a versus device be so for
example GTX 1070 versus a 1080 which I'm
pleasing because they just came out and
you can see the Delta between those is
maybe I think in our test it was a I'll
top my head it was something like 30
watts which is about right so you see a
30 watt difference that'll help you
figure out if you need more wattage in
your power supply now to answer the
question well also actually just a quick
throwing we did a big how many watts do
you actually need article it's pretty
lon it's got a lot of specific systems
and component configurations tested so
you can find out how many watts you do
need in that article and then kind of
extrapolate from there based on your
components because I'm sure we didn't
pick the exact thing that you're
building but that said how close can you
get away with in terms of actual wattage
amount generally you will actually
almost always you'll be at peak
efficiency with the power supply at
fifty percent load so if your load is
500 Watts you'll want something like a
thousand watt power supply to be a peak
efficiency but that might be a peak load
scenario so how often will you actually
be at 500 watts and the answer is
normally not very often so for things
like gaming you'll tend to be at a
slightly lower than the total system
power consumption possible just because
gaming isn't the most intensive thin
that can happen if you were to do
something like transcode a video and
transcode or compile software or
something like that simultaneously you
basically had one hundred percent load
in such an instance and if you're doing
that regularly you would want to account
for that in your power supply selection
but generally fifty percent will keep
you towards the peak efficiency of the
power supply you can certainly push
higher than that I tend to saturate my
power supplies at eighty percent went
under peak load but I also know that my
system is almost never under peak load
so for normal use I'm sitting at fifty
percent or less for idle and the closer
you push that one hundred percent
capacity the more likely you are to have
things like voltage droop or excessive
heat that cause
death of the power supply or other
components capacitors can blow things
like that but that should hopefully give
you a basic guideline check out our
article the how many watts do you need
article that will give you more
information next question is we've got a
couple here nacho chips is question i'm
looking to buy a cpu cooler and ditch my
stock intel cooler i want to test the
temps on stock and then on the
aftermarket cooler which stress test
program do you suggest this is
benchmarking this is what we do there's
a couple of them prime95 is really good
but i know there were some issues with
Sky lake I have not seen them lately I
don't know if they were completely
resolved by the microcode update that
Intel pushed but prime95 with the large
FFTs you'll see a pop-up and ask you
let's use use large f of tease that will
load the CPU almost exclusively and
that'll put it under an upload to
generate heat and and create your high
heat scenario then for measuring you can
use a 264 free edition you can use the
twenty-dollar engineer addition you can
use speed fan mostly accurate and
hardware monitor plus those are all
options are monitoring the temperature
if prime95 isn't working for you because
of some reason microcode or whatever you
could also use 3d mark and just kind of
run it at a really high setting and put
it on the cpu test the physics test that
will load the cpu almost exclusively and
that would be a good generation of sort
of a more semi real world but still
synthetic load for for temperature
testing there are other options as well
those are the 2i would look at four
basic testing next question Colton
Parker can you explain UEFI and legacy I
install the new hard drive in my system
and there was a problem with it so I
went on forums and bunch people said
enable a disabled UEFI or legacy so
first of all legacy refers to bio space
can put out this output system UEFI you
serve to bios bios is really when people
say the combined turn UEFI bios its kind
of left over from ages past there is no
really more
bios the way it used to be it's all UEFI
now UEFI is some console interface
basically it's a type of firmware that
can more directly communicate with your
app your OS layer so UEFI is capable
talking to windows where BIOS could not
and that's where you get programs like
AI suite or something like that where
you can tune the CPU from within windows
that wasn't possible with just bios so
that's the difference between them in
that regard and the regard that you're
asking which is boot order I have a
couple notes here just kind of make sure
I address every key point quickly so
first of all bios a legacy after post
which is the power-on self-test that's
when all the devices are enumerated and
post and tells you what's working what's
not and does error beeps if there is an
error after post the legacy version will
check each device in the boot order in
order that you've configured and see
which devices are bootable and which
have an MBR present Master Boot Record
the Master Boot Record has a lot of
limitations one is that the maximum
capacity is is two terabytes for a
partition so you don't want that if
you're using larger drives which a lot
of people are now another issue is UEFI
can have multiple boot loaders so if
you've ever seen a screen pop up windows
8 on word that says you have multiple
windows installations which do you want
to boot to that happens because of you
UEFI which uses the GPT which is a GUI d
partition table rather than MBR Master
Boot Record so it enumerates multiple OS
is a lot cleaner makes it easier to do
multi installs and boots generally you
will want to install every new system
with UEFI mode selected first do that
before you install your OS you've
already installed your OS you need to
select the one that it was configured
with otherwise it just won't work
because the MBR versus GPT a disparity
between them so I think that answers
that the last question for there's a
couple others I do want to address what
we'll do it next time last question for
today you kept flashing that big red
button this is from the last video what
should I have done with it again so
you've already forgotten please
