nexus dotnet and we are back with the
spiritual successor of our steam
greenlight spotlight series the show has
been officially rebranded as the hyper
edition of our heat signature series
thus expanding its focus to all manner
of upcoming games rather than just green
light and for today's episode we're
highlighting seven promising gaming
titles including Double Fine's new
strategy game and MMORPG that's driven
entirely by player-created music a
charming platformer that uses player
death as an integral mechanic and the
successor to nitronic Rush and of course
more let's start with with that last one
the successor to nitronic rush and that
is known as distance it serves as the
follow-up to the hit indy racing game
and distance fuses classic arcade racer
elements with a futuristic neon
aesthetic resulting at what feels like
an amalgamation of stock car racing
speed racer Tron and trackmania that's
that's kind of how I see it and
especially the track many of it so game
mechanics consist of boosting jumping
flight and rotation which is effectively
gravity reversal and players must
overcome obstacles and survive the
entire course hopefully scoring in a
quick time and there's multiplayer level
editing modding stunt mode capture the
flag all that stuff available check that
out along with all the other games in
the description below if you're
interested moving on to slot number six
we've got the forest which is an
open-world Survivor horror hybrid that
aims to integrate with oculus rift which
is probably the most interesting element
of the whole game of course oculus rift
is the forthcoming virtual reality
headset that's out of the scope of this
check that out separately if you're
interested link below the forest is a
sort of interesting mix of traditional
survival elements like resource
collection and encampment with
traditional horror and exploration
elements as evidenced so clearly by the
games of naked Slenderman and or I
suppose also communities human being I'm
not really sure which is the more
appropriate example there the lead
developer of the forest has serious
visual FX experienced the movie industry
Tron Legacy and three
are some of his credited projects and he
notes minecraft trespasser and in the
movie world Cannibal Holocaust and the
descent as influences for the forest
moving on next we have void destroyer
which I first spotted on a star citizen
subforum where the developer of the game
offered his game as a means for our side
backers to tide themselves over before
star citizen has launched void destroy
refuses tactical unit command with space
flight combat to create a new space sim
that's focused on the grander scale of
things the entire war rather than just
individual conflicts and similar to x3
you've got a scalable in-game economy
massive space sectors and conflicts and
as a twist the game reduces the focus on
the players individual combat
performance and and rather looks at the
overall command of other units while
still putting you on the frontlines very
interesting mix there moving on to
number 4 we've got a plain old bizarre
game abducted is self described as a
quote an action adventure mystery horror
game so yeah it sounds a bit lofty and
ricci but the themes appear to fit
together from what little information we
have right now the player character has
been spoiler alert abducted and taken to
another planet where she must progress
through environmental puzzles combat and
atmospheric oddities in order to learn
where she's been taken and why I
maintain that bizarre is the correct
descriptor for this one before we get to
tim schafer and double fine let's talk
about one more small game called life
goes on we've actually written previous
articles about how death can be used as
an interesting game mechanic and that
it's generally used irresponsibly by
developers as a form of punishment and
life goes on the player is often forced
to sacrifice her current hero to pave
the way for future spawns making for
interesting gameplay decisions and for
instance in order to cross a pit of
spikes it may be necessary to
purposefully die on them and then use
that body to hop across with your next
hero in the same fashion players can
utilize their infinite heroes corpses to
block gates or hold down switches and
stuff like
that a very interesting puzzle
platformer that's definitely worth
checking out and hit that below if you
are interested and now we move to
massive chalice double fine's latest
venture in an experiment in tactics and
strategy using dwarf fortress esque
multi-generational heroic bloodlines and
classic turn-based tactics to create
something new and so what unique units
will be born grow to become heroes and
inevitably die on the battlefield or
vault age then pass down their knowledge
in the form of relics to later he rose
and all of this happens in one campaign
effectively under one roof the game
spans hundreds of years so as you
progress through the campaign you'll
need to strategically try new heroes to
take place of those who will soon go
extinct ideally strengthening them with
each generation the team is still
looking for funding for this one so do
check that out if you like Double Fine
and want to back them finally let's talk
briefly about anthem anthem is an ultra
ambitious project to bring music
creation and mmorpgs together except
rather than just hitting hot keys on a
bard you'll be actually creating the
music with your group members you choose
your starting city and class based on
personal music tastes and it pretty much
covers every donna and there are actual
in-game locations similar to those
tastes that fit in with the story this
becomes relevant later when you end up
using in-game lessons on music theory to
craft your own war songs the depth of
which is not discussed and those are
then played in rhythm based battle to
fend off assailants in standard gameplay
so that's all for this episode check out
the links below if there's a particular
game you're interested in and standard
kickstarter disclaimer kickstarter
involves risks so don't invest in
something without heavily researching it
first have fun and i will see you all
next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
