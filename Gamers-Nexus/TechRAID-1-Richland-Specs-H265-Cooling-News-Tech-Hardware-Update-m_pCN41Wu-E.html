nexus donna and today i am introducing
our new gaming and hardware news series
tech raid every other week i'll be
putting a news roundup video online that
covers all the most reason and relevant
gaming hardware and gaming news the goal
is to keep these short fast-paced and
focused on the hardware and tech aspect
we will have links in the description
below if you'd like more depth on any of
the topics please comment below with
feedback so i can improve these videos
going forward so let's jump to the
episode for this episode we have seven
toppings to cover including leaked specs
on trinity successor richland and some
very interesting cooling advancements
from all the cooling companies so
starting with richland in a recent leak
it was revealed that and the successor
to trinity's 5800 k the a-10 of course
is officially at richland a10 6800 k and
will operate natively at 4.1 gigahertz
an increase of point 3 gigahertz and
will utilize a modified HD 6000 series
chip officially rebranded as the 86 70d
don't let that confuse you it is not the
8000 series we've been waiting for just
a rebranded 6000 series chip it should
be a pretty impressive follow-up to
Trinity but perhaps not as impressive as
Andy's upcoming Kaveri project which
also launches later this year in theory
and will feature a fab drop to 28
nanometer process and should have
overall better specs it looks like
there's a series shift toward the
integrated market definitely a lot to
look out for in graphics news and vidya
has announced the release of new beta
drivers claiming massive gains at sli
performance for crysis 3 beta and large
performance jumps across the board for
games launched around quarter for 2012
single card performance was also
improved by these drivers and you'll
find a link to the download for the
drivers below as well as it's all
contained in the same news article so
check that out silverstone a world away
from semiconductors we have news from
silverstone of a unique new case fan
design that aims to minimize turbulence
induced high-frequency acoustics
produced by throttled air between the
fans blade and the case is metal mesh or
filters most cases with 120 millimeter
fans will exhibit some variation of this
quiet but annoying noise which tends to
resemble a whining sound Silverstone
aims to eliminate that noise by using
three different fan blade designs within
the same unit you'll see here they've
demonstrated to read this to reduce
turbulent air caught between the fins
and the mesh which reduces that annoying
acoustic the resonance you get will be
looking at this new fan relatively soon
along with antics nude shoe quiet fans
so do keep an eye out for those videos
and in more cooling news coolermaster
the renowned of course cooler and case
manufacturer has officially launched its
side on 240 millimeter and 120
millimeter closed-loop liquid coolers
these were originally announced a while
ago they were officially launched and
they aren't your standard ace tech
rebadge from what I can tell as it looks
like these side on coolers use a
different cold plate and mounting system
from the A's tech supplied coolers these
side on units are available in 240
millimeter 120 millimeter and 120
millimeter XL and are fitted with a very
nice mounting mechanism that we're all
used to from the high four to 12 and it
even looks pretty damn good too as an
aside coolermaster also has its new
storm line of peripherals available and
those were very promising for what we
saw at CES but I don't have time to
cover that right now in a completely
unrelated sector of the industry the
h.265 encoding standard was approved
this week by ITU and what does that mean
well the h.264 is the previous iteration
it is the popular high efficiency video
coding standard and the new iterate
that's what we use by the way in many
other video editors use but the new
iteration h.265 aims to have bandwidth
requirement for video meaning you'll be
able to render out videos at higher data
rate for higher quality but utilize the
same bandwidth this is ideal for mobile
devices and benefits everyone not just
video editors as you will be able to
stream the current quality video at a
lower bandwidth so you won't have any
stuttering or higher quality video at
the same bandwidth now back to cooling
in cases for a moment we recently
reviewed
Rose Wells armor evolution mid tower
gaming case we've previously been very
impressed by the quality of some of the
company's cases but we're unfortunately
left scarred by the poor build quality
and design of this newer option despite
the case really destroying in the
performance side of things it did
phenomenal in performance just really
mediocre for quality so check out the
youtube channel for that video review
and finally for our last topic we look
to fractal design for their new case
launch the arc midi are too i know many
of you are fans of fractal who have
recently become famous for their high
quality materials optimization for quiet
cooling and sleek looks but this case
aims to further all of those points the
arc midi are two ships with three silent
series fans a fan controller a swivel
able set of drive cages if i can make up
some words and heavily leans toward ease
of installation features the case is
targeted at a hundred ten dollars MSRP
and should be available in march of this
year we will try to review it for you
that's it for this tech roundup please
leave a comment below let let me know
how you think i did if you think there
should be more topics with less info or
fewer topics with more info let me know
let me know how frequently you would
like to see these videos and the current
plan is about twice a month so with that
i will see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
