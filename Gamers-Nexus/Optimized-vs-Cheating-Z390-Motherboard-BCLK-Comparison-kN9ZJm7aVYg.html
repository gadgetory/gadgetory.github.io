benchmark here's a histogram of all our
test results for the Intel I $9.99
hundred K at presumably stock settings
the scale is shrunken and non zero as
the results are so tightly clustered we
had to push them together but you can
still see that we're ranging from 1970
CB marks to 2300 which is a massive
range that's the difference between a
heavily overclocked to r7 2700 and an
overclocked 7900 X so 4.2 gigahertz
eight cores versus 4.6 gigahertz
10 cores except this is all on a single
CPU it's all in the 9900 Kate stock the
only difference is that we used five
different motherboards for these tests
along with a mix of auto XMP and MCE
settings the discussion today focuses on
one it is considered quote cheating to
modify CPU settings via bios without the
users awareness of those changes the
most common change is to base clock
where bios might report a value of 100
point zero zero but actually produces a
value of 100 point eight or point nine
on the cpu this functionally pre
overclock sit but does so in a way that
is hard for most users to ever notice
before that this video is brought to you
by thermal grizzly and their high-end
thermal compounds Thermal grizzly makes
cryo not paste for high thermal
performance and conductivity without
being electrically conductive so you
don't have to worry about shorting
components Crona is particularly good
for replacing stock GPU pastes as cryo
not is a non curing compound
learn more at the link in the
description below that's what we're
looking at today we're looking at the
differences in BC LK and how it affects
baseline performance so this is a
problem because running tests sometimes
they'll come across reviews or user
benchmarks where it's not really
controlled environment where they might
not know that BC LK is different we had
this issue with MC e last generation
where one of gigabytes board had boards
at MC e enabled by default in the
original pre-release bios this was later
corrected for the released bios and all
later iterations MC e was disabled now
what is MC e you might be asking if you
don't already know multi-core and hasn't
we did a video on previously but it's
just this feature that's in the boards
now you can enable it
whatever and it will auto boost all of
the cores to the highest single core
frequency Intel bins it scores in a way
that you've got 5.0 gigahertz on the
best core for a single core boost
whereas you might have 4.7 gigahertz all
core for the 9900 K it has an example
and with MCE on it would be used all of
them the 5.0 and that's an overclock now
that's not an issue this time
fortunately MCE is basically gone it's
disabled by default on all five of these
boards and the only thing now is that
where MC e is gone some of the vendors
primarily one have become a bit tricky
with base clock instead which is another
way to pre overclock the CPU so for the
boards we have today that we're testing
with the ACS Maximus 11 hero we have the
gigabyte zi 390 master we have the MSI
godlike board the EVGA Z 390 FTW and the
asrock Taichi ultimate that's what our
test platforms are for today you've got
an idea of MCE base clock effects
everything so it is what the CPUs
multiplier multiplies against to get the
core frequency that's a big deal so even
a 101 base clock can have a big impact
on the frequency because you end up 50
megahertz ahead if you're going times 50
for example and then it also impacts
PCIe bus speed it impacts the ring bus
the system agent lots of stuff gets
affected by B CLK memory frequency as
well gets affected by B CLK and we also
talked to companies about why they chose
the BC LK settings they did so base
clock our firm belief is that as all of
these boards should be 100 point zero
max and ideally that's it just 100 point
zero period but that's not what they all
do and we talked to the companies that
don't do that asked why and got some ads
we'll talk about those at the end but
before those let's go through the
component testing where we look at just
Cinebench this time cinder bench isn't
that creative a task for reliability and
you'll see that in here but it's good
enough for some quick runs and it's good
enough to enumerate clock so we can see
how it behaves and multi-threaded for
single threaded so good for that
situation we just Hardware in photo log
everything constantly and we did our
Cinebench runs without any login
software then did them again with
logging software
just to make sure the results for
performance were isolated from the
logging of the frequencies in the base
clock in case there's any interference
there we have over 325 runs of Cinebench
conducted on these boards so it's a lot
of data and we have all that to look for
the differences in base clock and when
is it considered cheating to increase
your base clock this testing primarily
looks at BC LK differences as this is a
sneakier way to impact performance of
parts without leveraging maxed out
ratios via MCE something a lot more
obvious this generation all five of our
boards ship with MCE disabled so that's
great news BC L case should be set to
one hundred point zero by default for
all motherboards for the most part the
board's fall within this range or
they're close enough at ninety nine
point nine nine nine or something EVGA
operates at around ninety nine point
eight and although this might sound like
a small reduction of only 0.2 megahertz
it does mean that all core frequency
ends up at forty six ninety instead of
4700 mega it's not a big deal but it
shows you just how much small changes to
be CLK can impact me final speeds
remember this is the base number that
multipliers work against ergo the
difference multiplies this isn't really
that big of a deal again ninety nine
point eight is close enough and worst
case it's undershooting not overshooting
so there's no stability concern ebj has
some performance overhead they could
calab AK if they wanted to though msi
really does some screwy stuff here msi
maintains a 100 point 8 bc LK when XMP
is enabled in either version of BIOS or
100.5 when the board is left to complete
Auto settings ie out-of-the-box
configuration this means that the CPU
runs at about 40 megahertz higher
natively at all times that Ram is also
overclocked PCIe is affected rain bus
and system agents are affected and so on
MSI has boosted the numbers in a
somewhat noteworthy fashion and appears
to be the only vendor doing so in such a
sweeping way for this generation well
come back to em assign a moment but
let's get through the rest of the boards
first gigabytes master motherboard runs
dead steady at 100 megahertz in all of
our testing averaging thousands of cells
of data it's about 99.999 865 so we call
that one
this is what the frequency should be as
one hundred megahertz times 47 is 4700
megahertz or 4.7 gigahertz the asrock
board is also at around one hundred
megahertz and all tests between both the
old and new versions of BIOS with XMP
either on or off doesn't matter
Asus is the next of the boards that
shows some questionable behavior but
only briefly with XMP on or with
settings manually adjusted Asus operates
at 100 point zero megahertz PC LK which
is exactly where it should be with the
full default settings complete auto ACS
operates at 100.5 BC LK what starts
impacting performance results in funny
ways sometimes fortunately this is only
for the full auto settings so if you're
worried about reviewers who use this
board like us it wouldn't affect any of
them for the most part or at least it
doesn't affect us because we always
enable XMP and then configure the
timings if necessary this eliminates at
most concern of data contamination a
good portion of users probably don't
know to enable XMP though and so we'll
be running pre overclocked unwittingly
100.5 times 47 is 47 24 megahertz the
ring clock runs at 43 20 records instead
of 4300 system agent runs at 1005
instead of 1000 and single core runs at
50 27 megahertz instead of five thousand
mega hertz memory speeds are also
affected here we'll come back to this
more in a moment but to better
illustrate how these BC LK changes
impact performance here's a chart of
multi-threaded Cinebench scoring across
all configurations we should first point
out the outlier result at twenty one
ninety five points gigabyte z3 90 master
motherboard is leveraging MCE to max out
all cores to the single core turbo of
5.0 here's the thing and this instance
MCE is okay because it was a manual
change made by us gigabyte does not try
to trick MCE
into being enabled under auto or x and b
configurations this is the correct way
to do it we think they're offering an
option but not sneaking it into a state
of being on and so we commend gigabyte
for this arrangement asus does sort of
the same thing for MCE where it disables
it completely unless you tell it
explicitly to be enabled at the low end
we have the acs maximus 11 hero with XMP
enabled and no selected when prom
for enhancement options after enabling
XMP to performance is actually worse
than depicted here because the CPU is
hitting a snooze power limitations on
ICC Macs on occasion we saw a power
throttling from 10.8 amps to 8.8 amps or
130 watts to 105 watts under some
Cinebench multi-threaded workloads when
running some passes it doesn't always
happen but a power throttle is enough to
cause a lower average score and the
worst AC score here because of the power
throttling wasn't 1976 points just for
reference if we highlight the a C's
Maximus 11 hero with Auto settings
you'll see that it actually outperforms
the board with XMP and no selected to
the prompt if Asus is following proper
power throttling to match Intel's ICC
Mac specification they should probably
also follow it under complete Auto
settings just with X and P on we find
this choice of behavior odd to say the
least
selecting yes to the prompt results in a
score of 20 56 points which is markedly
higher than the 1976 to 2030 range of
extreme variants that we had with the no
selection option and roughly equivalent
with the auto settings that's because
the auto settings are using a 100 point
5b CLK so it's able to achieve the same
performance as the memory under XMP
finally msi clearly holds an unfair lead
Emma sighs BC LK of 100.8 is resulting
in a 2087 score in Cinebench
multi-threaded which is significantly
ahead of other boards that use lower
base clocks the next closest board is
gigabytes of master motherboard which
runs a be CLK of 100 point zero or zero
zero if you want to be really specific
power consumption is another major part
of the story and this one doesn't carry
the questionable variance and accuracy
of a Cinebench in general for these
tests we were looking at clamped power
draw down the EPS 12-volt cables for
each board EVGA runs the lowest power
consumption a consequence of also
running lower voltages the EVGA FTW
operates a 120 watt EPS 12-volt draw
during both the auto and XMP tests
gigabyte is adjacent at 125 watts with
all of the asus tests falling within the
range of 130 watts let's again knock out
the outlier and address the one
96 watt draw number that's from enabling
MCE explicitly by the user on the
gigabyte board which again is done
manually you could do this on the Asus
board as well if you wanted to power
consumption goes way up to support the 5
gigahertz all-court overclock as
expected and single core power draw also
increases as you can see here MSI draws
significantly more power than EVGA
gigabyte and A's use motherboards
borrowing the MCE results pushing
upwards of 140 watts with a baseline
configuration this is a result of higher
voltages sustaining a higher base clock
higher system agent clock higher
rainbows higher PCIe speeds and still
also contributes to temperature variance
in results we've talked about that part
in the past you can see previous videos
for that even still as rocks board is
aggressive in its power pulled down the
EPS 12-volt cables with a 100 bc lkm the
word clocks than msi asrock is blasting
voltage unnecessarily and boiling 145
watts to 160 watts during tests the
updated bios is better by 12 watts but
still overkill when compared to everyone
else and that includes msi which is
running a higher b CLK than anyone else
either this board should be closer to
EVGA and gigabyte for the asrock board
that is and it's over drawing power in
an unnecessary way after all that then
here's the thing msi is the only one
that really steps way out of line but
that's a pretty big jump when you
consider it's multiplied by whatever the
multiplier might be and it's not huge in
so far as performance it's a higher
performance result for sure 2080 cv
marks first is everything else below it
but it's not game-changing it is however
enough where Emma sized board looks
artificially better in ways that it
doesn't really deserve now we're not
saying which board is or isn't the best
here but what we are saying and we have
different content for that we are saying
is that Emma size board these ether 90
God like maybe it is better in some ways
but the ways in which it is demonstrated
as better here with higher points in
Cinebench are not because of the board
it's because the CPU is functionally
overclocked and so that kind of creates
an hour view an unfair stack where
looks like the point structure the point
distribution favors MSI's board even
though it's actually just favoring a
higher clocked CPU that's really the
difference so that's a point of concern
and again it's not a big difference not
like we're looking at 2500 versus 2000
but it is a difference and motherboard
vendors are constantly struggling to try
and prove that they are providing a
value over their competitors so that's a
big point that should be made where if
someone's not at 100 if they're not at
spec or at least not at what is expected
to be spec then yeah they look better
than everyone else and maybe not for
reasons that are resultant of the
motherboard quality there are other
concerns with this too because so
there's a good reason to do a higher
base clock maybe an MSI we talked to
them about this maybe you want better
support for high frequency memory and so
MSI so that they set their base clock
higher we wanted to talk to them about
it figure out why are they doing this
and I'll just bash on it without
understanding why so MSI's says they saw
their base clock higher to more easily
support higher memory frequencies like
40 to 66 megahertz for example which is
very hard to sustain so there's there's
good basis there but here's the thing
the trouble is the math doesn't really
work all memory is divisible by the same
dividers and it can be multiplied by the
same multipliers so against PC okay so
if you got 42 66 megahertz memory and
you divide that by 41 point 33 then that
equals a 103 base clock not 100.8 if you
do it the other way let's say you do it
forty to sixty six divided by forty two
point six six well that equals 100 so
neither of those is 100.8 so we're not
really sure where they're getting 100
point eight because it just it doesn't
work for this math the clock gen we
understand might have something to do
with it but the end of the day there is
good science I guess to saying that
increase in your base clock increases
your high in memory support because you
can reduce the memory multiplier where
you can run 103 times again 41 point 33
or something instead of 100 times 42
point 66 that might be more stable for
you
but that's not what's happening here and
it should be done probably on a per kit
basis if they can store all that in the
board's flash so that was homicides
reasoning they said they use it for qvl
guidance for qualified vendor list
guidance for Z 390 at least they have a
reason we don't think that's a good
reason
they also said after we kind of pushed
them on it a bit that well it's better
performance and so of course our
response is right but that isn't that
doesn't that seem wrong is that unfair
to achieve better performance that way
and it didn't seem like at the people we
spoke with at MSI really either
understood that line of thinking or
agreed with it one or the other but it
seemed more like a a disconnect and what
we were concerned with versus what they
were concerned with so to MSI's credit
yes they are correct it does increase
performance and that's the goal that's
fine we just think it should be openly
declared somewhere on the product page
on the Box in BIOS BIOS it says 100
point zero right now even though it's
100 point eight so BIOS isn't it's kind
of misleading to so we it's okay it's a
pre overclocked product if you want to
they do it for GPUs all the time it's
just it should be openly disclosed and
we mentioned that to MSI and they're
looking at updating their website and
their pages for the product to state
that so that's good that's what we want
ultimately is for it to be openly
declared so it's not like it's a secret
that people just don't notice because
why would you notice 100.8 most people
who aren't reviewers will never notice
that and so then their power consumption
is suddenly way higher than what all the
reviews show and they're confused why so
that's a kind of big deal with
motherboards where these small changes
in base clock that shouldn't be there
greatly affect numbers so what I want
from you all is I want to know post your
comments below try not to let too much
of the musings influence your thoughts
just go by the numbers we showed what I
want to know is this post a comment and
say if you think they should all be 100
base clock or if you think it's
completely fine if they pre overclocking
because that's basically that I mean
that is what it is it's not basically
what it is it's literally what they're
doing is pre overclocking the base clock
so if you think that's fine that's
totally cool just please let us know why
and if you don't let us know why as well
because what's gonna happen is we're
gonna send this all the
motherboards manufacturers features in
this video and they can read through it
and see why you think one way or the
other and not have to hear it from me
they can hear from however many tens of
thousands of you instead that would be
far more impactful than just coming from
me because I just complain all the time
anyway so other reasons we think that
this might be a problem it's kind of a
slippery slope you get back on that
slope towards MCE being on by default
that's a bad thing we don't want that
that influences performance it's
cheating and people don't notice it and
the power consumption is higher and if
you have PSO DS we've seen it because of
pre overclocks like that not with 100.8
BC okay probably not gonna happen but
it's a slippery slope argument and and
one which could actually become true
because it has in the past for this
situation for Ace uses part a CS agreed
that base clock should be 100 megahertz
on auto settings and weren't quite sure
why it wasn't so they are looking into
that I believe is my understanding now
so that's good too
we think this is a problem because
manufacturers will go into an arms race
by pre overclocking means that they
probably shouldn't it could be bad for
stability if there's power consumption
numbers way off and ultimately you end
up with reviews where now your different
reviewers you watch using different
motherboards if they don't notice this
stuff and that's totally fair because
it's kind of sneaky some of it then the
results will be different we didn't
experience that fortunately we use the
AC board we selected XMP so our base
clock was 100 and all those tests but I
mean look back at for example the
principal technologies testing they used
em aside boards those red 100.8 so all
the results can be boosted by another 40
megahertz on the clock and that is
somewhat substantial in some tests so
anyway that's it for this one let us
know what you think this is kind of it's
hard to blow it up and make too big of a
deal out of it because the numbers don't
look super inflated it's just it's a
really small incremental way to create
what we think are unfair differences
between motherboards when it's actually
the CPU doing the work I mean it
effectively be like if you put the CPU
in that board set it to five points you
gigahertz and say that it's better
because it was preset to 5 point 2 Giga
it's not really the motherboard doing
the work there so that's it for this one
let us know what you think subscribe for
