are live find out momentarily who wants
to chat shows up I think we're only on a
couple second delay so we should find
out quickly are we here it I think we
are live hopefully we are this is our
first attempt at a live stream hopefully
some of you start showing up and you can
let me know if the setup is working for
you I'm going to go ahead and share this
link everywhere so give me a second okay
people are starting to pop in alright
cool
before we get to preview please as I'm
talking post and chat let me know if
there any major issues audio/video that
we need to resolve think we got it all
on the side general though we did a
sneak preview over there on the tiny
side channel and a couple people we're
lucky enough to be our guinea pigs for a
moment so thank you for that today we
are going to be taking this apart this
is an old cooler master cooler
it came with who's holding the camera
your cat snowflake is in fact holding
the camera she's been I don't know if
that's a lateral move for her in the
company but seems like a step down from
senior and the analyst but a step up
from her previous position of shipping
and receiving so yes so what we are
doing is dismantling this this cooler I
believe it's a site on it came with my
AMD 9000 series CPU about years ago
so before we start really working on AMD
CPUs with the company directly I bought
a 95 90 I want to say or 93 70 I think
it was 95 90 my intention with that was
to get some experience with AMD's
high-end at the time and it came with
one of these now this has been through a
lot of abuse it's still got some dust in
the radiator and what I'm gonna do is
take it apart and see if there is still
liquid in there because one thing I
don't actually know right now is if it
has fully permeated or not because in
theory the reason this thing failed is
because the liquid permeated the tubes
that's what I want to find out so we're
gonna do is open it pour it into a
bucket see how much liquid is left in
there
and if it's not much then we know why
the pump failed if there is the liquid
then I don't know we'll figure it out as
we go so okay I'm gonna check chat for a
minute and see if everything looks good
cuz again this is our first live stream
thank you for being here ten minutes
until start yeah we start a bit earlier
than scheduled sorry I don't see anyone
complaining about audio/video so I think
we are good cool
maybe a little overexposed some
commentary about exposure and white
balance we can look at that okay I think
we're okay overall though but please let
me know if there's anything major
otherwise I think we are rolling video
quality's good people are saying okay
sweet well thank you for joining so our
plan with this couple couple
housekeeping things we don't plan on
doing a weekly scheduled livestream
right now my current plan is basically
as I run into things where I'm like I
need to take this thing apart we'll just
try and post a tweet and say tune in and
about an hour tune in a couple hours and
we'll tear this thing down live that's
the plan not planning on doing any kind
of weekly news show or anything like
that right now there are a lot of those
and I like our short news video format
for that and the plan is to interact
with chat a bit more so that will make
it kind of fun but yeah other than that
before getting into the teardown this is
brought to you by Thermaltake and their
core g21 chassis I think there there is
there's a link into the in the
description I'm ahead of of the curve
here today so link in the description
below if you're interested in that it
has tempered glass on both sides I think
it's a $70 case so it is a budget
tempered glass case with SLI tempered
glass panels alright let's let's go
ahead and get started with this there's
a half second delay for audio someone
says that anyone else see that is my
question to you what we're going to do
is I guess we'll start with removing the
the mounting bracket here which is just
Philips head and then there's some weird
triangle style screws on there as well
and slow mode is on yes that is correct
slow mode is on just so that I can make
sure I can keep up because I'm the only
one moderating right now all right so
let's take this apart I think we're
gonna start with these screws and then
move on to the triangle screws the outer
ones are just Phillips heads and have
you used the ek WBA 240g yet I have it I
have not used it I need to and I'm
planning to soon we have some stuff in
testing right now that I can't talk
about yet but once all that's done I'm
planning to move on to some of the new
ek stuff and do some noise noise
normalize testing like 40 DB a noise
normalized and then for those of you who
are our patreon backers in discord you
know who you are if you guys wouldn't
mind doing an at Steve and tagging me if
there's anything that I really need to
know about with this stream and pay
attention to or if there any important
questions things like that please do
that because I'll see that in discord
pretty easily alright so that was easy
that's the mounting bracket I want to go
ahead and take this off and get on the
triangle bit where's the triangle bit
there's one of them let's see what size
that is
okay so is actually that might be the
right size I don't know that I've gotten
a chance to use these oh yeah there's a
fill port on the top yes okay so that is
third size what is this this is a two
millimeter okay so that's two millimeter
for the triangle I am curious about the
fill port actually I'm kind of tempted
to just like punch that in and drain it
I don't know okay chat chat should vote
you guys want me to just pull this thing
out where it says warranty void when
removed which I actually pushed it in a
little earlier and it's clearly like a
fill port or should we just remove the
cold plate and go through that way the
old-fashioned way that's what I want to
know other than that what else do we
have here we've got a dirty radiator
protruding copper plate this design is
not really used anymore and punch it
through a drain it drain it what mike
are using we are on a son Heiser g3 we
use it for our it's a wireless setup we
used for conventions drain a drain the
drain it smash it open it
who needs warranty punch it drain it
okay I think got the point okay I got it
all right thank you let's get the
disclaimer face in the camera I don't
know how this actually comes out to be
honest with you
does it twist off I don't think it
twists off never I'll be honest guys
I've never worked with this site on
Kuler enough to know anything about it
so you're gonna see live me probably
just punching a hole in it it's a screw
underneath it and a fill port kinda
tempted to just say oh actually is this
covering anything important they like to
cover stuff with these
nope no hidden secrets yes no food so
that is stuck on there that's not that's
not a screw Ralph that's enough food
alright you know I'm not gonna reuse
this and if I do I'll cover it with tape
let me just I'm gonna poke at this I
really don't care if it breaks what
happened if we just kind of push that's
not gonna go in pry the cap off yeah we
can try that let's try prying the cap
off what do I have for baby crying tools
look at this
give this a shot screw underneath and a
fill port rubber insert removed from the
top okay so do we remove it from this
part or do we like fish it out from here
and hear your discord sounds oh really
sorry about that I fixed that how do I
let s-- just mute discord
it would be nice if their volume mixer I
was gonna say it'd be nice if Microsoft
could not change their interface alright
so that should fix the discord sounds
who's ready in discord yeah I think we
fixed it let me know if it's not all
right so do we fish it out keeping in
mind that I don't care if it breaks off
the cab yeah I feel like the caps gotta
come off somebody at all I don't know
how to release it
you know I'm gonna think we're gonna go
ahead and go through the Coldplay
because I'm not 100% positive and I
don't want to go too crazy to ham on
this right now pull it up you yeah I
can't grab me the what we have over
there that I can use can you grab me the
red pliers and the gray crappy pliers
how old is it it's as old as the 95 90
when did the 95 90 come out yeah
use pliers they say let's destroy the
caps they say why not there's actually
metal under there I'm not gonna drink
the liquid there might not be much in
there it's propylene glycol it should be
technically fairly safe you still don't
really want to drink it
reciprocating saw all right I'm gonna
I'm gonna do this my way reciprocating
saw before anyone complains that there's
camera shake it's the table and we need
to fix that at some point it's actually
the easiest so for her cold plate that
I've worked on those are the 9000 series
that was someone said yes it was the 95
90 what does that FX series
which this died so anyone tuning in now
we're taking this apart because the pump
that I had set up in my my main daily
system has now died three times three
different pumps a silverstone tundra
which is made by a politic two of these
made by Cooler Master I think they're
just overheating the liquid temperature
was getting too hot from that FX
processor because it's a 220 watt unit
the airflow is not great in there I
ended up fixing it so it's it's resolved
now but we're going to take this apart
and see if when they fail is it a result
of the a result of the permeation
trying to read chat while doing this at
the same time if you can put on streamer
mode on your discord it'll stop those
discord notifications stop I think they
did yes I thought it was a rubber insert
but uh I wasn't having too much luck
with it and I don't feel like spending a
bunch of time looking it over and I've
done it this way before so we're gonna
go this route the good so there's two
approaches to this one if we can get
this thing apart without destroying it
which I don't normally care too much
about we can actually attempt to refill
it just out of curiosity I wouldn't use
it but we could refill it this is oh we
got one of those donation things cause I
think you're the first one to ever do
that is that Ryan Ryan says this is for
snowflake get a can of Fancy Feast on me
dog snowflake is not going to appreciate
the dog sentiment of that but I will do
so
shoutout to the cameraman yeah we
thought that was kind of cool
so Andrews met Andrew is manning the
camera he does the video and editing
work normally but we thought it'd be
kind of neat to do that for a live
stream just for something different yeah
there's a lot of screws sorry tomorrow
we're almost there this is why you guys
watch the edited versions this would be
done in like three seconds and I don't
have the best driver for this right now
but it's the only one I had a bit for so
because so weird triangle bit to
millimeter by triangle bit what do you
think about flashing by us on a 1080i to
get more performance well what kind of
BIOS flash are you looking to do hang on
one sec I need to actually pay attention
to this for a second are we gonna leak
if I flip it over yes definitely we will
I will try to get back to the Oh try and
get back to the BIOS flashing question
alright I should have gotten more paper
towels than we did this green so how
much fluid is still in it there's
actually quite a bit this thing might
might not have permeated all that much
it sounds like it sounds like a bathroom
break it sounds like you forgot to turn
the mic off alright
so despite being green and looking like
something spider-man would drink this is
theoretically propylene glycol there a
couple different types for the adblock
but I can't get a shirt right now thank
you for that I'll try and check the
other question once I get my hands away
from this liquid
okay all right so I think I can set this
aside for a second we're still kind of
bubbling at the top let me put that down
for a second
wipe that off elsewhere and try and get
back to this question oh hello from
Switzerland well thank you much
appreciate it
okay so yes we've gotten rid of the
green coolant those of you who have
watched our tear downs of coolers before
you already know the deal it's a
propylene glycol this is so this is two
parts this is a part distilled water
trying not to get it in my hair part
distilled water and then basically the
the way the manufacturers do this we
describe this an hour
how do liquid coolers work video the
reason they do propylene glycol is well
there's a few reasons one of them is it
helps with storage so a certain amount
of propylene glycol is dictated by the
manufacturer not the supplier so NZXT or
Coursera or EVGA might go to something
like a ZOTAC or cool it and say we want
20% mixture or we want 40% mixture with
the other sixty being distilled water
and the reason we want that is because
we're trying to target storage in a
minus 20 or minus 40 environment Celsius
and that's part of the reason another
part of the reason is just because it
happens to do better in a liquid cooler
where your cooling something very hot
expansion properties are a bit different
these tanks actually aren't filled to
the brim we were kind of talking about
that in one of the Vega videos is the
liquid dangerous I am NOT going to
commit to an answer to that because I
don't drink it I think so theoretically
if you look up propylene glycol and
Wikipedia I think it is supposed to be
safer than some of the other types of
glycol coolant but I still wouldn't
drink it it's not gonna
well I'm not gonna commit to any answers
on safety Ron's dream so yeah don't
drink it it's not water though so it's
not just like pure water it's a
distilled water and glycol and that
helps with a lot of things it changes
the boiling temperature to the way they
seal this and all that stuff so liquid
temperature for these coolers tends to
be about 60 C target that's what a stack
targets this is not a stack cooler this
I believe was one of the last site on
coolers before cm was kind of sued out
of using them by ASA Tech at least in
the US but 60 C is about what the liquid
temp can be so you could have a CPU
let's say you did a really kind of worst
case scenario and you ran something like
a to 80 millimeter kraken X 62 I'm
saying this because I've done this and
you forgot to plug in the pump or
something what might happen is your CPU
sitting there at 99 C throttling itself
the liquid temperature even though the
CPU is at 99 there's still gonna be a
big Delta there might be in the 70s now
that's still way over spec which is 60
on that particular cooler and eventually
you have concern of boiling inside of
the system or of permeation or things
like that and the pump is not well if
the pumps not moving to test matter but
the pump needs the liquid to be cool to
be lubricated anyway so let me catch up
on chat here anything I need to see ten
dollars to do more videos like Rx Vega
and 1080i hybrid we are absolutely
planning to do more of those thank you
for that yeah we have some pretty cool
content coming up I've been working on
some special benchmarking today that
help you live this week we have
benchmarking it from yes we will leave
the stream up we have benchmark beaten
from some unreleased and housed products
as well it is not so it's not ethylene
glycol there are two types propylene
glycol is normally what's used and it is
definitely used in the a is tech coolers
you're correct I'm not positive what's
used in this coolermaster one but
generally speaking the haze attack ones
which dominate the market do use
propylene glycol not ethylene it is a
bit safer and they can get away with
using it for this type of application
Asian Wow everyone here just lost the
game I don't think I've seen that in a
very long time but damn
alright so that's that's part of it I
don't really know what to do with this
we're gonna look at the cold plate and
some other stuff in a moment though once
I get this reasonably uh we might need
some better solution than this but what
do I put this put this on the floor
don't step on it
oh yeah go fishin I've read that boss
the game thing everyone's complaining
that they lost the game okay all right
so what's next cooler or a cold plate
maybe
okay all right sorry for the pauses I'm
trying to keep up with the super chat
stuff okay so this is the cold plate
you've seen them before in our videos if
you haven't welcome to a cold plate this
one's a bit different than traditionally
so you can see at the edges cooler
masters supplier for the cold plate has
sort of bowed it out and normally they
are flat these days so the manufacturers
used to do there are two types of cold
plates there was a perfectly flat one
then there was one with a very slight
indent it was concave very very slightly
you'd have to take a laser to it to see
the difference and the reason they did
that was because if you're cooling on an
IHS there's a slight curve to an IHS so
theoretically your cooling is gonna be
better if your cold plate matches that
curvature this has actually been stopped
they don't really do that anymore but
that was a thought then the GPU plates
were flat on the bottom so this part
down here they're perfectly flat and
that's because well GPU is pretty much
exposed with no IHS so you take better
contact with a flat plate now they've
all basically replaced it with just a
flat plate period and there is no more
no more curvature on the the mainstream
coolers these days that I'm aware of so
internally these are micro fins if you
are not familiar with them the little
copper fins here are called micro fins
the way these work is well there's a few
things one the liquid comes in one side
and goes through the other sometimes
they have a rubber gasket on here or a
split flow setup and you can learn about
split flow and the and what the gasket
does an hour how liquid coolers work
video maybe someone can link that in
chat for me but the liquid flows through
you've got the fins to add surface area
so it helps sync the heat into a larger
surface area spreads it out just like a
heat spreader would liquid comes through
and whisks it away into the rest of the
cooler to be dissipated by the fan on
the radiator now the two things here to
be pay attention to the fin density
determines kind of how well these can
actually deal with that
the the thermal issues coming from the
CPU so finding city is one thing that's
how tightly packed these are together
another aspect is the thin pitch so
that's the angle of the fins some
manufacturers don't do it straight
ninety degree like this one does see if
I can get there you go so that shows
like you can see it straight is standing
straight up so thin pitch is nothing
special here sometimes they change it
though and now the reason you don't just
pack these in as tight as possible
because you're also concerned about
impedance so impedance of the liquid is
a problem where the more you pack these
in you may end up with a case where
you're actually hurting the cooling
potential more than your help in it and
that's just gonna be because of well
because the liquid can't really get
through well enough so I think that
explains those pretty well there's
actually a rubber gasket around here
around the edge this is to help stop
liquid from leaking out and then we've
got foam padding over here which is
probably and I'm not positive because I
don't tear coolermaster units apart
generally this is just to force the flow
through a certain area coming back to
1080i question to improve performance
yeah let's do a couple reader questions
for a moment then we'll come back to the
cooler so the question was a while ago I
think it was should i flash bios on a
1080i to improve performance flashing
bios on any card your if it's a non
custom bios first of all be aware that
you can break your card normal
disclaimer all of that you might want to
flash it for example to increase your
power limit you could certainly do that
on some cards increasing the power limit
would potentially give you more Headroom
if you are power limited on your
overclock you can flash it with a custom
bios that's been tuned by someone else
for your card which may do something
like under volt in or something like
that is it worth it depends on your card
and what BIOS exists out there for it or
if you have to make your own you use a
hex editor and dive into some of the
settings yourself that we've been doing
that lately are there any other major
questions here I'm learning I'm learning
super chat I think we've gotten through
all of them
am I missing anything congratulations on
150 thousand subscribers in your first
live stream thank you yes oh geez ADA 50
bucks
yeah first live stream I guess I could
have said something about this being 450
thousands of subscribers we're pretty
excited about it
I mean I'm just using a razor ripsaw
right now is pretty cheap to set up
we're plugging it into our camera that
we just bought we have video about the
new camera it's a UX 180 and it's
working pretty well we're plugged into a
bench I threw together is not a
permanent streaming machine it's just an
i-9 7900 X and because I was testing it
and that's got a Quadro card in it just
because it's quiet and then some other
stuff but yeah that's what we're set up
to let me get one more question then
look at this cooler some more we ever do
a video showing what happens if he is
kalium based liquid metal on an aluminum
cooler or mixing copper and aluminum
over time I would love to I don't know
the best way to do it right now I'd have
to think about that I do I am planning
to do some stuff with liquid metal soon
I can't commit to a timeline on it we
have a lot of products we're reviewing
right now keep an eye out I don't think
we're gonna do mixing metals yet it is
something I'm interested in just to show
like a practical here's what happens if
you do it and here's how long it takes
okay so alright I'm gonna stop reading
those for a moment let's get back to the
radiator so a pretty standard setup here
you've got a radiator with tubes these
tubes are there are two types of tubes
there's a rubber tube and then there's a
more plastic rigid two of which you can
just I mean you can feel the thing and
tell the difference and these plastic
tubes that cm and other people use have
a Teflon inner coating in them more or
less and that coating helps with
permeation is highly resistant to
permeation which may explain why so much
the liquid is still in there though I
don't know if it was enough and the only
downside to that Teflon coating is if
you start really bending this thing like
kink it like a hose
it will crack and if that tap on coating
cracks you start having all kinds of new
problems so that's their design choice
here is to use the teflon inner coated
plastic tube some people use the rubber
tubes down this hole I don't know can we
get a shot of that there's the impeller
is down there and can you see that maybe
maybe a little bit need to focus there
there we go so that blade down there is
the impeller I don't think I'm gonna be
able to poke at it we'll take it apart
that's what maybes you liquid around and
then there's you're in and you're out
basically as I understand with this
cooler right now so keep an eye on
superjet okay alright what else can we
look at here how do we take this part
off of the other part is there an easy
way to do so it looks like there's some
so there's little see that right there
these little clamps these are just for
the bracket these are on the a so tech
colors as well but they're more exposed
so we can push let's try pushing these
in and see if it just separates that
would be nice and easy push oh I just
pop the background - goodness okay so
one
please one my hands are like coated in
that stuff still
there we go see it's starting to
separate where's our next one and over
here you're still okay that's looking
better okay next I see the PCB I look at
chat in a second guys
alright so we are obviously dismantled
Item had 4k I don't think we have the
upload to support that sorry we do have
the equipment to do it
I'll get that Google Fiber when it comes
in alright so let's take a look
Stream buffering sorry about that so
what we have here is solve this you've
seen before if so it's a little bit
different here but not too much
there's your pump cap it's obviously the
cap of the pump goes on top right there
and underneath it just a piece plastic
underneath it there is so we've got our
pump motor right here and then the PCB
which the PCB is generally it's got some
firmware on it I don't think this cooler
was updatable by firmware at least not
by the user and they probably wouldn't
do it service like and service either
but the newer coolers that aren't
ancient like this one by cooler
standards have firmware on them that you
can normally update or have service
update and that includes things like
pump speed adjustments for example or
lighting adjustments if you have an RGB
cooler I'm tempted to just start
unscrewing that let's see what else is
on there power cable over here and then
this is really not that complex alright
any different bit
yeah it makes the motor spin I know you
got the idea that impellers below it
alright let's just see if we can get the
impeller out it's kind of kind of
difficult to work with while also
showing it to the camera but work with
me here
I just watched the MSI bloatware video
yeah that was a fun one I don't think
much has changed unfortunately but we're
looking at some more laptops I think
that Nvidia max-q might look into
bloatware as part of their requirements
okay so we freed the cable what else is
in here what's holding us in nothing
okay cool
trying to read chat alright so we got
that out and we have exposed some dust
we have exposed the rest of the plastic
part portion of the cooler impellers
still in there this is actually impeller
housing so if we can get access in there
we'll be able to pull the impeller out
it's it's just I think three or four
fins that's been nothing that's special
really
and there's the electromagnet for the
motor and then what else do we have
does this separate I don't know that the
separates I don't think this separates
that easily if it does I kind of want to
get the tubes off the barbs but I don't
know the best way to do that it's my
first time working with a cooler master
cooler normally we do a stacker cool it
oh this is nice though I'll point this
out I wish I wish more than would do
this nothing there's much function to it
they do have an in and an out indicator
arrow so that's nice a real reason but
they do it we're still leaking fluid can
you lock the camera position for a
second and get me something to set that
up
if you want to do your drooping if you
want to grab mm-hmm
just a hand out like one of the and owls
it'll probably work better alright and
just grabbing something to help me out
with this because we ran through all of
our of our napkins and veins already the
CM have their own unique pump so this is
an older cooler it's changed since then
the newer CM stuff like the master
liquid I haven't really looked at lately
but they do have their own pump design
they make their own unlike a lot of the
companies where it's either a Sutekh or
it's
what else is there a politic they're a
lesser known one they make the Leppa
coolers if anyone knows Leppa AKA under
Max's sub brand so a pol tech makes them
ap alte K and then ASA tech is the big
one cool it his another semi a fairly
big one they're pretty big pool it
neighs the tech both work on core share
stuff and then who else is there a
couple Dino Tron Dino Tron makes or made
the antec 1250 and the other older antic
coolers so those were the ones that had
the the pump mounted on the fan that was
Dyna Tron they made those to get around
the ASA tech patent which is kind of
interesting that's been an ongoing issue
in the industry um oh I just clap since
the mic sorry
so the patent more or less states that
the pump can't be on the cold plate or
in the same block so Dyna Tron and an
tech work together to move the pump to
the fan which is an interesting design
but there's a lot of problems with that
one you can't replace the pants which a
lot of people do and you start running
we're dropping flank frames someone says
I'm seeing 0.1% drops frames I'll keep
an eye on it if anyone sees more of
those please let me know so yeah Dyna
Tron and an tech works on that solution
cool it does some Corsair coolers
they're pretty well known as in the
industry as well and then the rest is
all is all just going to be smaller
brands that either do things like the
Silverstone tundra or the Leppa lick Max
and lick tacky coolers just like it
probably work on those names so yeah I
think that walks you through most of
those we'd be making a video on bios
flashing I do want to well if you're
talking video BIOS the answer is I would
like to do something like that because
it's relevant right now with Vega we're
trying to figure out how to work with
the BIOS there's really two methods you
can
couple of Raspberry Pi and dude
externally and it's not necessarily the
easiest thing to do or figure out where
you can get a solver to love flash it so
if we can figure out how to flash EFI
then the plan is to hex edit the BIOS
that's on there
increase the power limit flash it but
like I said before I'm not promising
that because I don't think we're gonna
be able to do it right now unless we can
get the last we can get the tool from an
AIB partner or something so I think
that's pretty much the cooler I don't
really know the bottom of it that's
that's really all there is to it though
so yeah pretty fun thank you for joining
for this one I'll hang out for a minute
and we'll talk in chat for a quick
announcement we have our new shirts live
this is one of them so this is a try
blend we also have cotton it's the
design and you just came up with it's
basically a teardown or explosion view
of the GM logo does not come with the
lavell ear mic and it's it's kind of
cool it's got some like PCI Express slot
stuff on there down the bottom corner
it's got vrm components it has blower
fans all that stuff and then I also have
where's that gray shirt where do we put
that one we also have a grey shirt
design thank you so then we have the
grey shirt here which is gonna have to
be washed now because it's got propylene
glycol on it but yeah pretty cool stuff
so those around the story and go to
gamers Nexus dot squarespace.com to pick
those up link is in the description as
well alright so let's go through some
questions while I'm here while I well I
have everyone for our first livestream
ignoring the cooler for a moment how
much coolant was in the cooler you know
that's a good question that I kind of
want to pour it into pour it into let
just measure it measuring cup or didn't
see how many milliliters we have I
actually don't know thank you disturbed
medic glad to hear no dropped frames so
that's what came out of it though if you
missed their earlier part of the stream
it looks toxic you probably shouldn't
drink it but
it's also not radioactive waste there is
some dirt in there which really isn't
supposed to be in there but some of that
I think is from me screwing around with
the pump the fill cap earlier and not
really really committing to removing it
properly next question
hello any chance of you guys getting a
look at Enterprise version of ASA tech
products you know that's a really
interesting question I could do it we
could we'd probably get some in I've
really thought about it to be honest we
could definitely get some in though what
else is in here
next question oh they they don't have
shirts for his fat people someone says I
think we did up to 4x if they're not in
stock then I'll make sure we can get
stuff back in stock any plans concerning
the horizon multi-threading content a.k
yes so the answer that is yes we did
some streaming tests with thine eyne CPU
and it was a learning experience I was
the first time done streaming benchmarks
I want to do more of them I'm again left
wondering what to do with this I want to
do more of them and we are doing more of
them right now but that content will be
up this week so stay tuned for that it's
it's closer than then you would think we
are just focusing on gaming and
streaming right now for those
multitasking workloads I'm not
introducing anything like 100 chrome
tabs I know it's a bit hyperbolic but
not really working with chrome tabs or
watching video playback or anything
right now it's just going to be live
stream while gaming because those two
things are pretty common they are very
easy to replicate and automate to some
extent and so that reduces a lot of the
test variance concerns but I'll look in
tomorrow any other questions that are
tagging me that's what I'm looking for
right now go and review the six core
first gen AI 7 or Xeon x 5650 you know
we got a lot of requests for that and I
am I am not sure if we will or not it's
it's an interesting idea we we're so
slammed right now with like with some
Rison follow-up stuff with planning for
thread Ripper with planning for our
expand tree promise that right now
if someone suggested hook the pomp up
and see if it works that's kind of an
adjust to see it spin I guess probably
start spewing coolant everywhere but we
could try it I need a 5 X shirt okay I
will ask them to add that in the next
print run
you know it's has some of the really
small form-factor cards half-height
please any specific requests on those
how often do you think you guys will be
able to livestream I don't think I I
said at the beginning so at the
beginning of the stream I was basically
saying we're not planning a scheduled
stream we're not planning to
like weekly news show or anything like
that there are a ton of those out there
people do a good job of it already
my plans are basically when I'm taking
something apart anyway either for work
or for curiosity will try and throw on a
stream
hopefully announce it a couple hours in
advance if not a day in advance
oh man everyone's tagging me now but
that's the plan for the stream going
forwards basically kind of ad hoc do it
live style and we'll let you know in
advance if we know in advance otherwise
we're sticking to the standard weekly
news format for the news videos there's
a stream today's content for the channel
yes it is we will have a separate video
for another day but this is the content
for today please make sure your snow yes
I don't worry I will make sure it's no
flip snowflake will not get near the
coolant it is going straight out
received the rise on our three yet
cannot discuss may my AIO just died and
spilled into my power supply yikes what
should I do
first who should I contact I'm gonna say
the CLC maker tell them the issue
hopefully they'll cover the cost of
whatever other components died I don't
think the power supply that's really not
in the power supply manufacturers
territory how did you tell the AI Oh
died all these times that it kill any
hardware or did he get lucky
so I just knew because the CB
temperature started spiking really hard
Windows performance was so bad that when
it really finely would died I couldn't
drag Windows around at anything more
than a couple FPS so that's how I know
CP temperature spiked like crazy do you
think Intel will begin soldering their
CPUs with all the flak they've gotten
I'm not sure here's what I have to say
about that
so there is a reasonable amount of flack
to send Intel's away for not soldering
their CPUs we talked about that when we
deleted the Center 900 X at Computex
and I hope that as people make more
noise and reviewers make more noise
Intel will start thinking maybe we
should do something about this but it's
also a slow process
so they might already be in the gear of
changing things but we're not gonna see
that as changes reflected in products
for a long time yet takes a while to
roll that tooling out and they don't
have a new product right now other than
the stuff that just shipped so I hope
that it's something they're considering
I would hope that making noise means it
will be considered I would also
encourage remaining like civil and
level-headed in it and not just sending
hate at their Twitter account because
the PR person is not gonna forward it
along but yeah that's all I really have
to say with that a second a vid on the
best cooling method for nvme SSDs Isis
Ark some people about that those are
tricky to cool in the middle of a PC
bill most the components C via cooler
but ready but no mounting kit for a m4
yet can I boot into BIOS by pushing the
a IO to the CPU manually the answer is
yes just don't I mean they take a lot of
force to really adequately cool so just
be careful if you do that I don't know
do you really have a reason to do that
as the question or can you just wait a
day if if you can't just wait a day then
I guess you could do it who is this guy
okay isn't no solder good though because
it makes deal it in easier well I think
the idea there yeah deal it is easier I
think the idea is that you wouldn't do
it if it's soldered or at least most
people would perform should be a bit
better so I think that's kind of what
that comes down to thank you for the
support I love your channel from lonely
hacker thank you for the support to you
for the upcoming ek a 240g testing I
need trustworthy numbers yes we are
trying to work on those
okay so I've gone through a couple of
these I'll keep an eye out for a couple
more there's a coolant in the AI Oh any
good or does it clog the fins over time
this one I don't know I can't I couldn't
tell you I don't think it clogged
anything I'd have to like really dig
into it cut it open to know generally
that stuff comes with like a biocide and
that should help with with some issues
and then it also is propylene glycol
that shouldn't
clogged veins now there is stuff that
clogs like there's some open-loop
coolant that's clogged on the market and
it just kind of creates a sediment but
you don't normally see that in a iOS or
CLC's as I call them what is the new
camera again it is a Panasonic u X 180
we have a video on the channel talking
about it so that's all should be public
if you search for new camera on the
channel I think you'll find it I'm gonna
take I'm gonna take three more all right
so three more have you done the cooler
dissection yet yes I'm sorry this is
what's left of it that's the cold plate
and I think the DVR is enabled for this
so you should be able to go back and
watch this is the rest of the the pump
housing and some gaskets and things like
that pump cap pump plate impellers in
there and yeah that's all there is left
of it really okay the next question will
there be a whole new lineup of thread
river coolers I guess yeah we'll be
interested to see the differences the
answer is yes there will be new thread
river coolers that's not I don't think
that's a secret I think everyone pretty
much knows that the question of that
though is well the plates look like this
or are they going to widen them and I
think some of the manufacturers at least
are going to be going with a more
standard circular cold plate like this
that might not cover or contact the
entire IHS whether or not that matters
remains to be seen the thing with that
is in theory you don't need to touch the
whole IHS with the cold plate because in
theory the dye is only occupying part of
that space so as long as you have
contact directly over the die area then
it should cool reasonably well until we
actually test it though I can't tell you
if contacting the entire IHS with a fat
or cold plate which would have to be
customized for thread Ripper and would
increase the price I can't tell you
right now today if that's gonna be
better I would think it would be but how
much is the question is it worth the
extra cost because it will cost more to
make a bigger version of this since all
the manufacturers already buy their cold
plate supply with the designs you all
know about so
will there be a new design probably
someone will do one will it matter I'll
try and find out and let you know okay
let's take one more okay I'll take two
more
this one says are there more thread
rescues than the two that have been
confirmed ten core 20 threads perhaps I
don't I think I like to have been
officially confirmed okay do we have any
more I think that's most questions hey I
have a question does x29 hind suck the
hard answer to that does it suck is no
the more complex question is in what
ways does it suck or in what ways is it
insufficient if we're going to be more
correct X 299 isn't a bad like the CPUs
have a 900 X is not a bad CPU but some
of its things like the thermal concerns
the power concerns which we've been
testing power by the way I overclocked
one to four point five gigahertz with a
V ID of 1.15
7900 X I think we were drawing at the
PCIe or at the EPS 12-volt cables I
think we were drawing I want to say 20
amps by twelve point three volts so what
is that does that come out to 2246 watts
and then stock I think we were drawing
like what was stock it I want to say was
15 under a prime workload which is a
pretty heavy workload peasant is about
15 understand a bench as well twelve
point three that's so we're at like 180
watt stock out of box which is higher
than the TDP a TDP is not power drop but
it they're normally pretty closely tied
so it is higher than that so yeah it's
x-29 highest problems for sure it's not
the worst thing in the world but Intel
has a lot that they need to fix like
thermals and ideally power motherboards
could have some improvement if you buy
it just like anything else just research
it see if if it's something you can fix
for your needs or if there's a better
all
about their thread refers not to
terribly far away and theory SIGGRAPH I
think is coming up it would be
reasonable to assume that there would be
some kind of discussion there we already
know
all right so Vega will be discussed
there so keep an eye out for that maybe
we can see how a competition looks yeah
that's a kind of a nice interesting
question to when approaching vendors for
review units what metrics do you
emphasize to soften the blow of a shitty
ROI I'm not positive what that means so
when we approach vendor these days the
vendors approach us if I ask for a
review unit I basically say here's the
testing I want to do I think it's pretty
cool I haven't seen other reviewers do
XYZ
we want to do XYZ what do you think and
they'll probably say that sounds cool
let's do it and then we work together
test it if I run into issues or find
major flaws I'll communicate with them
and say this is a major flaw can you
guys see if it's happening on your end
if it's not could you send me another
unit make sure it's not defective if
that's not the problem then let's see if
you have a statement for me to publish
alongside the critical aspect of the
review so that people know you're
theoretically trying to work on the
problem that's how the review process
goes and then will you be attending ok I
can't talk about some of these things
thought on the upcoming Elmer's igloo
discussion the merger between AMD and
Homer Scalia I guess that's an in common
to Intel did you see that Intel's server
slide they put out they said and their
chips aren't held together with glue
like AMD's are yeah that was probably
not the greatest PR move okay all right
thank you for watching guys this is the
first livestream we've done I had a lot
of Q&amp;amp;A in there the cooler teardown went
faster than I expected we did not use a
drill this time which I also expected to
need so yeah thank you for watching tune
in tomorrow for our regular content if
not on the channel at least on the
website gamers nexus net you can check
out our new shirts at gamers Nexus
squarespace.com there's a link in the
description below we have teal we
gray cotton and tri-blend versions of
the shirts and subscribe for more as
always we're gonna try and do these semi
regularly with no fixed schedule as of
now that may change but not today
and last one have you commented on the
intel slides I think I just did
thank you for watching I'll see you all
next time I guess I guess I actually
have to end the stream it doesn't
anybody turning the camera off I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
