nicest on-net and today we're going to
be looking at overclocking or CPU using
basic BIOS and UEFI BIOS this will cover
the principles and methodologies of
overclocking and is not meant to be a
specific guide for specific numbers on
CPUs so please ask us for detailed
support on CPU specific questions and
apply these basics to your overclocking
endeavors
check the description of this video for
the full highly detailed overview of
overclocking where we explain what it is
why you can even do it to begin with and
how to do it so I've also posted a GPU
overclocking overview video so if you're
trying to overclock your GPU check out
that video as well now with CPUs if you
are an absolute beginner I'd recommend
reading that primer first with that set
there are a few key elements of CPU
overclocking that should most concern
you most of which are terminology but
there's certainly skill involved too
it just depends on how far you want to
push it as far as BIOS goes
most modern boards will certainly have
UEFI BIOS or visual BIOS and Intel's
case your input will largely be the same
in both classic and UEFI BIOS you'll
most likely be interested in any
overclocking utilities that your board
has as well for me the tab that that is
called AI Tweaker MSI also has an OC
Genie utility asus has ai tweaking
asrock has their own proprietary
overclocking tab and they're all
primarily the same at the end of the day
some are certainly more detailed than
others to overclock only your CPU
depending on which CPU you have you'll
be modifying multipliers sometimes
called the core ratio and you'll also be
incrementing the base clock speed
potentially depending on the CPU and the
voltage here's how they all work
together the internal clock rate which
is your CPU speed the number often
advertised as X point X and gigahertz
2.9 gigahertz the int that is called the
internal clock rate this is the product
of the external clock rate which is the
base clock or B CLK or bus speed or any
number of other synonyms really and it's
that BC LK multiplied with the
multipliers and that equates the
internal clock rate so if we have ABC LK
of say 133 megahertz like and first
Jenna I 7 would have an a multiplier of
22 X like a first gen i7 would have then
your internal clock frequency will be in
the range of 20 900 megahertz ish or 2.9
gigahertz Ivy Bridge will lean toward
higher multipliers often in the 30s or
40s but remain most stable at lower core
clocks like 100 to 105 megahertz that's
pretty stable the reason for this is
because intel has opted for a a lower
core clock or base clock or whatever you
want to call it busted because that
consumes less power it will be less hot
as a result and you can just rely on
multipliers which now are getting
increasingly higher with every iteration
of CPU this means you don't manipulate
the B CLK quite as much a newer CPUs for
Intel anyway and you can often rely
heavily on again multipliers for basic
overclocking but the principles for all
overclocking are the same and these CPUs
still use hypertransport overclocking
and all forms of other overclocking but
we will cover that in more depth if you
have specific questions so you will be
messing with the the actual base clock
of AMD CPUs if you want to push it as
much as possible and really optimize it
but for the most part stick with the
multipliers the objective of what you're
actually trying to achieve with with
overclocking is quite simple after
reading the detailed article you will be
aware that overclocking serves primarily
to speed up multi-threaded applications
that can utilize more processing power
not all games will take advantage of
this so please keep games in mind if
that is what you're focusing on and keep
also in mind that you may not see a
noticeable improvement or even any FPS
improvement at all from overclocking it
really depends on the game
encoding rendering and things of that
nature will certainly see an advantage
because they will they're not quite as
bottlenecked as games are it's all just
it's it's all game really of getting
what you paid for the chip can often do
more than stock settings and the reason
for this is covered in the article and
primer but to go over it very rapidly
it's because Intel and AMD will been out
there chips to be the most stable common
denominator which means it will be
slower so most chips are clocked to
slower speeds to ensure stability with
their customers and and then it's your
job basically to get as much out of that
chip as possible the methodology here is
simple you'll incrementally increase the
multipliers or be CLK each time you boot
into Windows and or well before you boot
into Windows obviously and each time you
do boot it into it you need to check for
stability most modern systems will
initiate a thermal shutdown of things
get too hot this is an attempt to
preserve the CPU so don't freak out if
it happens it's probably a good thing
because it's protecting you most likely
any freezing or shutdowns are an
indication of volatility in the CPU is
overclocked settings and you should
probably step it back a little bit I
would recommend running prime95 to run
torture tests on as many threads as
possible this should provoke a failure
in a contained environment if the
settings are unstable and if the CPU
seems to be surviving you may be able to
continue to increment those multipliers
and be CLK a bit further keep running
this test every time you increase things
because you'll want to provoke that
failure as soon as possible that way
it's not happy it doesn't happen in the
middle of something important once you
find the threshold at which the system
becomes unstable it is time to start
considering voltage modifications or
decreasing the OSI levels those are your
two options you can either step it back
or increase voltage you have to be
careful with increasing voltage since it
has the potential to cause a
catastrophic failure in your CPU if it
is over volted but if you stay within
the guidelines for your CPU you should
be fine look up guides or ask us for a
specific help and I'd suggest to do this
on our forums where you'll get more
responses more quickly
increasing voltage will increase
stability and allow you to get those
last few bits out of your clock rate or
multipliers
and the Antep hour will help you help
the CPU itself the best way really to
explain it is that it more voltage will
help the CPU keep up with itself it
increases the bandwidth so to speak of
the gates on the CPU so with that in
mind it is going to generate more heat
because of course there's more voltage
so you need to very carefully monitor
the temperatures using core temp if
you're in Windows this is an excellent
program or thermal probes core temp
should read directly from the CPU and
some UEFI BIOS options will also be able
to read directly to Windows using
software that shipped with your
motherboard so you'll want to monitor
that thermal probes are a hardware
option if that is more interesting to
you that is the basic overview of CPU
overclocking if you're still confused or
have more questions
there are certainly tons of numbers
thrown at you with these higher-end
boards
especially this asus rog board i've
messed with that is running on on an AMD
processor so there's definitely a lot to
learn but for the most part is very
simple as far as multipliers go you can
certainly get four gigahertz out of
almost any CPU these days without much
problem at all and that is with even a
stock heatsink but with that said let me
issue a quick disclaimer please note
that overclocking will often I'm
actually not aware of any any times when
this isn't true it will void your
warranty so do not overclock if you are
afraid to pay for a replacement but
don't be don't let that scare you away
from overclocking the other just do it
responsibly do it in increments as I
have said a hundred times now there's a
reason for that because it is very
important just be patient do it a little
bit at a time and you'll find a great
stable setting for your CPU and be able
to get a little bit more power out of it
so with that please let me know if you
have questions comment to LIKE and
subscribe as always for more videos like
this check our forums for the
very responsive staff that we have who
will help you with almost any question
you have about CPUs and overclocking and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
