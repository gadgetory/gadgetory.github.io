dotnet and this is your weekly hardware
news recap first up for this week is the
patent lawsuit between Nvidia and
Samsung that is still progressing not a
big surprise though and if you recall
one of our last updates and Vidya
actually lost its case against Samsung
and NVIDIA is appealing that decision so
the quick history here is that Nvidia
issued a patent lawsuit against Samsung
for alleged GPU patent technology
infringement and Samson then countersued
Nvidia on four counts of alleged patent
infringement but from samson side they
were alleging that Nvidia had infringed
upon intellectual property involving
memory technology memory chips and these
were of course used in GPU so both major
companies have been fighting each other
to try and stop or prohibit sales of one
device or another from either company
and that would be a pretty big somewhat
vicious movement that I actually played
through on either side but so far NVIDIA
has lost its claims against Samson and
actually Nvidia had one of its patents
invalidated in the process samsung had
its four claims looked at by a judge and
so forth and the first one fell through
the second two were ruled a mistrial and
then the last patent infringement count
that samson was bringing to levy against
and vidya was ultimately ruled on by a
jury which found that just recently and
video was not infringing on any patent
technology which of course made nvidia
very happy as they note in their
statements so so far the main thing
going on right now is an appeal process
between Nvidia and Sam somewhere and
videos trying to appeal their decision
where they were pursuing Samsung or
patent infringement for GPU technology
so that is where things stand right now
next up is a pretty major announcement
from micron which is one of the world's
leading memory manufacturers they work
on SSDs and on DRM and also on vram and
this news pertains to the vram market so
micron has its gddr5 x memory which is
not the same as gddr5 and it is not the
same as hbm so there's gddr5 in the
middle is 5x on the far
speed is hbm and hpm version 2 is coming
soon sometime this year likely with
Pascal and the other architecture
updates so the deal here with GDR 5x is
it's a bit faster actually forty-seven
percent faster than gddr5 non ex and
that is because the non x version has a
throughput of 8 gigabits per second
whereas the new gddr5 x version of the
GPU memory is actually a 13 gigabits per
second quite a speed increase again
forty-seven percent so that will be
major for the GPUs that don't feature
hbm or hbm version 2 for reasons like
cost and hbm is a bit too expensive
right now to be hitting the lower end
market maybe even the mid-range markets
we don't know exactly how much cost but
it's certainly too much for low-end and
in these certain applications the memory
used will either be gddr5 or microns
brand-new gddr5 X which will be a bit
faster be cheaper than hbm and actually
gddr5 X is a lower power consumption as
well so it's good all around it's just a
matter of implementation at this point
and mass production is already rolling
out micron has already tested its
initial samples and they've claimed that
things are looking good so far we've got
a quick news item on the game in front
so this one is about unity which of
course is one of the most popular and
prolific game engines on the market it
is competing most directly with
CryEngine and that's made by Crytek and
unreal engine made of course by epic
game so these are the sort of the big
three engines right now and just as a
quick aside lumberyard which is an
amazon engine that is sort of ill-fated
ly named amazon lumberyard isn't exactly
the greatest selection of two words that
you can put next to each other but that
is another new engine that is based on
CryEngine so we've got four but three
major engines that have some tenure in
the industry that's unity unreal and cry
engine and the news item here is that
unity engine has just added support
officially for steam or valve vr and
that would include the HTC vive which is
manufactured by HTC they use their
production lines and their advantage
with certain technologies like displays
and it is engineered by valve who have
built up this contract so the
I've will be supported through unity and
that is good news for game development
all around because hopefully this helps
the major issue that we've talked about
with virtual reality which is a Content
problem this was further solved in
another news item from the past week by
assistance from gabe newell from valve
so in a recent steam event a steam vr
event the HTC vive was provided for free
too many many developers and this was a
gesture on Valve's part to try and
improve the content upon initial launch
which will hopefully trickle down to the
consumer in a way that makes steam VR or
the HTC vive a more immediately valuable
product upon purchase in partnership
with AMD HP the hewlett-packard company
that produces laptops and computers has
started to move free sync technology
into its AMD apu laptop so any a series
laptop the HP cells or at least most of
them going forward we'll be featuring
some version of free sync this is for a
few reasons I one of course they're
pushing the adaptive synchronization
angle where you get this adaptive frame
rate synchronization thing going on if
you are a gamer but the main news item
here probably for the laptop argument of
things is as reduce power consumption so
if you have an adaptive sync technology
like free sync there should actually
theoretically be slightly lower power
consumption that could impact battery
life we have not validated this
internally I would love to do that but
of course until that time I can't really
say for sure what the real world impact
is but that is certainly the advertised
impact from both HP and AMD the last
news item is a pretty major one this is
about CPU architectures of course I'm
talking about zen and the news here is
that CERN the European research firm
that works with nuclear and particle
acceleration and all these different
types of scientific technologies they
had a conference where they talked about
zen and if you're wondering why it's
because these processor architectures
are pretty critical to the advancement
of science early research and they're
normally looking at things that are very
heavily threaded looking at 64 or even
in some cases hundreds or thousands of
cores and threads but on our end we also
benefit from the advancements of new
architecture so relevant to us as gamer
the majors n updates that were announced
recently are an alleged forty percent
improvement in IPC which is an aspect of
processing that intel currently excels
at which directly relates to gaming
performance for the most part and that's
because a lot of games are very heavily
single-threaded dual threaded and they
like those higher instructions per clock
or per cycle that intel is generally
advantaged with on the zen that's moving
forty percent forward in a good
direction hopefully to achieve some
level of parity with intel and then the
next major item is that zen will be on
14 nanometer FinFET process which we
discussed in our AMD polaris video live
from the show floor of CES so FinFET
just a very very brief and quick recap
with processing nodes you have the
transistors that are the item described
by the nanometer so that's sort of what
we're talking about when we say 14
nanometer FinFET we are specifically
talking about the process or the
manufacturing fabrication process used
to create those transistors FinFET the
word thin is as in shark fin and that
very literally means there's a fin on
either side of the transistor so you
create this bucket it's straight down on
the sides and flat on the bottom more or
less anyway that's sort of a very
simplistic overview of it and this means
that there's less power leakage and it
contains its power a bit better all
these things are beneficial especially
to Andy who have needed the power and
wat draw advantage in recent years and
that is shown on Polaris and hopefully
will be shown in AMD Zen so then we'll
be using FinFET 49 abou process just
like their new GPUs and it's also
theoretically got a 40-percent IPC
increase from the previous architecture
which would include the fx-8350 for
example which is a number of years old
now so very exciting news all around if
Andy can actually deliver on these
things because it's been as I said a
number of years since a major processor
architecture from the company other than
just more and more refresh is and for
