access net and today we're talking about
who makes what in the world of liquid
cooling solutions for CPUs and GPUs so
we're talking about CLC's closed-loop
liquid coolers also known as a iOS
all-in-ones and specifically talking
about who makes the actual underlying
pump solution provided to the brands
with which you are all familiar this
topic came about following some of our
coverage of asa tech cooler master and
cool IT lately when readers and viewers
asked who is asa tech who is cool IT and
why do I not see their liquid pumps
liquid coolers on sale on newegg and
Amazon so the reason for that is because
they are OEM s or original equipment
manufacturers and they are effectively
suppliers in this market they supply the
complete liquid cooling solution to
brands that exist like Corsair NZXT and
several other companies AMD intel they
supply the cooler to those companies and
those companies provide some level of
design input and then effectively brand
it as their own and sell it as a
finished product there are many other
suppliers in this space as well so OMS
would include at the top of things we
have sort of the main aisa tech cool IT
and cooler master cluster of suppliers
and to give an idea of what they produce
what you've seen them in a syntax pumps
their blocks are normally circular and
those are sold through Corsairs product
line up the odd numbered ones like the
h110 the h100i gtx emotes odd-numbered
end or odd numbered 10 digit it's still
the GTX model which is an AC tech thing
of course there's line is pretty
confusing but you can see on the chart
that these are the products that ace
tech makes now of course are also
sources supply from cool itu make a
slightly different pump and cooling
solution but not different enough to
avoid a settlement with haste attack so
it's it's sort of similar at a top level
at least and those products would
include things like the h-60 the h80i
the h100i GT and similar products so
those are the actual suppliers of the
solution
now where does coarser in this instance
come out to play well a company like
Corsair enermax ndx he any of these
companies Silverstone not to single
anyone out any of these companies can
approach the CLC supplier the OEM and
provide a spec sheet they can say we
want LEDs we want variable pump speed we
want things like this certain type of
fan that we already make which by the
way is supplied from another company
like dynatron often and then the CLC
supplier will take all that data they'll
modify whatever their existing offerings
are they have a list of existing supply
that they can modify tune and customize
the manufacturers liking and then
hopefully that differentiates them
enough to produce a noticeable
performance Delta and testing it's not
always the case and we were there within
a couple of degrees of each other but
sometimes there's a big difference so
the manufacturer does actually matter
even though this feels like it's all the
same product and that's because things
as simple as fan choice can greatly
impact the dissipation ability of the
radiator if you choose a fan that
produces a lot of turbulence within the
fins it's not going to work very well so
it does matter and the company is like
the manufacturers and the brands do put
in some level of testing depending on
who it is so we've toured some of their
labs we've seen that they test these
things and the reason I bring this up is
because I don't want to ruin the
mysticism of the hardware industry for
any of you yes at the end of the day
power supplies cases coolers GPU heat
pipes all that stuff it comes from sort
of a small list of people the companies
that we see every day on newegg and
amazon aren't necessarily actually
engineering the very low-level details
of these products that doesn't mean they
don't have input so there is still an
important differentiation to be made
especially when you look at things like
support warranties testing validation
all that stuff but at the same time it's
important to note that a select few
group of suppliers are the ones actually
contributing the base product which is
what impacts the core performance of
that product to the industry so to run
through a few of them very quickly for
liquid cooler specifically
assotech makes a lot of the corsair
units that would include the h 110 the
h100i some of the GT suffix products and
cool ite also makes some Corsair units
including the even 10 digit models like
the h-60 the h80i h100i and things along
that nature the suffix GTX models and
then you have other companies NZXT their
x 61 x 41 x 31 the x 30 x 40 x 60 those
are all ASA tech products they've
differentiated themselves from competing
asa tech products like Corsairs by doing
different LED setups they have an RGB
LED they plug into the crack and
software and they have a variable pump
speed so that's sort of what they're
selling point is in that specific
instance then you have the sort of
smaller but boutique companies like
Silverstone and fractal design they have
their suppliers as well there OMS and
silver stones is a pal tech and they
make enermax coolers as well they make
epic coolers which is an animatics brand
so it's sort of all the OEMs get around
with these companies you can see all
their products from all the different
manufacturers and those lists or the
table should detail who makes what and
hopefully that demystifies things a bit
without ruining the the infatuation that
everyone sort of has about their
favorite brands if if they do have that
so that's the content for who makes what
on liquid coolers check the article link
to the description below if you just
want the table to get a look at who is
actually selling me the product I like
at the end of the day and as I said
manufacturers do still matter so don't
just sort of rule them out as relevant
to the process because it doesn't matter
it's more than just a sticker operation
it's more than just putting their brand
sticker on it that said you can buy
unbranded ones three companies like
system integrators high power cyberpower
those folks will sell unbranded supplied
liquid coolers to reduce their costs and
compete more directly with the DIY
pricing that's one of the ways they can
compete with the price and the DIY world
so that's all for this time if you like
