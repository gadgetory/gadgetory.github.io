differences are pretty simple there
really aren't that many at least not
that many really important ones are
critical and you can still use Rison 1 &amp;amp;
2 on each platform if you want to it
just comes down to the vendor to
properly support the CPU that you're
using make sure there's good memory
support for it and that's really the
crux of the differences its memory
support so in this test what we're
showing as X 370 versus X 470 but the
air quotes are there because ultimately
it comes down to all the million BIOS
variables and how well each motherboard
vendor has tuned for them before that
this video is brought to you by thermal
takes view 37 case the vo 37 focuses on
highlighting custom PC builds with its
full panoramic window and tinted front
acrylic and our thermal testing the view
37 performed reasonably well when
considering its looks focused build
which is partly thanks to the airflow
design and the removal of a bottom power
supply shroud for a balance of looks and
performance check the link in the
description below for the view 37 unlike
Intel chipsets where basically every
generation of chipset has some kind of
semi major change maybe the high-speed
i/o Lane count changing from 26 to 30
and these are pretty straightforward we
have a chart of the i/o differences
quick tip there are none and most the
rest of the differences really again it
comes down to memory support and
overclocking features not necessarily
memory overclocking as we showed in our
review you kind of get stuck at 36 66
maybe you'd certainly push it higher
under the right conditions but for most
users that's where you'll get stuck
maybe one tick higher so memory
overclocking itself hasn't really
improved a lot it's specifically memory
support for different kits and we will
demonstrate that today with guile versus
Corsair memory where we with one kit saw
very large differences in X 370 versus X
for Sony frame rate performance and the
other kit we saw basically zero
differences so what does that tell you
that tells you that the chipset itself
is not that relevant to the equation of
performance because when we talk about
motherboard differences or chipset
differences unless you have the exact
same motherboard in
both the last generation and the current
generation exact same 100% identical 110
identical BIOS everything unless you
have that and then you just change the
chipset you can't do a proper a B with
the chipsets so consider this more of a
how have the motherboards changed as
well have they improved at all like Andy
and the vendors would tell you they have
with memory support the only other
difference here is going to be precision
boost and store mi outside of the BIOS
changes and all that stuff in terms of
layout memory traces have changed a bit
and the rest is basically just coming
down to updates to UEFI and memory
support our previous video the 2700 X
review which you should watch showed
export sony memory testing for frequency
differences where we found that there
was about a 1400 point performance range
and times by when controlling for
timings that range dwindled down to 200
points which we can also show when we
left the sub timings and tertiary
timings auto and adjusted only the
frequency and controlled for the primary
timings the point is that these boards
are getting sophisticated now they're
getting good enough to change the
subtitle the tertiary times that most
people ignore don't pay attention you
don't know what they do so that they can
accommodate for less strain if you have
for example 3600 K that you drop to 3200
it might actually tighten up the timings
for you so you have to control all those
variables but that was where we started
with this let's go into the new data for
our final data in the review we switched
over to a kid of Corsair Vengeance 16 18
18 36 memory at 3200 megahertz we
performed initial testing which was not
published on our guile kit that AMD
previously provided but ultimately
discarded the data as the guile memory
performed significantly worse on both
Intel and AMD platforms but mostly AMD
we have two sets of tests to look at
guile memory testing with Auto sub
timings and manual primary timings and
coarser memory testing with controlled
timings the motherboards used are the
gigabyte X 470 gaming 7 and the AES
crosshair 6 hero X 370 motherboard for
watchdogs - starting with the 1700 X we
observed 2-0 difference when using
controlled timings and Corsairs
vengeance lpx memory which will
highlight with all differences landing
in-between error margins these are
functionally
the same you'll note that the error bar
is on the charts are aligned with
differences measured meaning that we
can't meaningfully determine an
advantage 4x4 70 or X 370 using guile
memory the kit that Andy provided with
the r5 1600 X last year we observed
about a 10 FPS change in performance
between the X 370 and ax 470 this is
primarily a result of sub timings and
tertiary timings which some AMD boards
still have a lot of problems with it
comes down to the board vendors make
sure your kits are validated for the
risin motherboard that you're buying and
you should be fine
those 10 FPS differences though manifest
as a 10% swing and performance 2x3 7e
favoring its but all this really means
is that e crosshair 6 hero has better
tuned timings than the gigabyte board we
validated this by looking at the
configurations and noted some
differences in user controlled auto
timings there are also timings that
never get presented to the end-user so
we can't be sure how those are
configured for the 2700 X with guy'll
memory we also observed about a 10 FPS
performance wane from 89 on guile with
x4 70 to 100 FPS average with guile on
x3 70 again this isn't the chipset it's
the motherboard and that means every
board is going to have slightly
different behavioral characteristics we
ended up testing only with coarser
memory as we found it to be best tuned
on all boards without requiring as much
extra technician oversight for total war
Warhammer we observed the Corsair kit
producing no significant difference
between the two platforms controlling
for timings functionally produces
equivalent performance when stock the
guile kit demonstrated 83% performance
difference which is small even for that
kit the 2700 X produced similarly
nondifferent results with the guy'll kit
we noticed about a 1 to 2 FPS delta
which is with invariance civilization 6
is tested for turn time instead of FPS
as the FPS increases with slower CPU is
due to lengthy turns sitting static FPS
is also a useless metric for turn-based
strategy games return time we observed
functionally zero difference between
actually 17 X 4 sounding for the 1700 X
demonstrated here we measured a 0.1
second difference that's within variance
for the 2700 X we also measured node
we are within error margins even with
the guile kit for project scars all kits
on the 1700 exit landed at around the
same performance this game is not memory
intensive which helps further illustrate
our point that memory sub timings are
primarily responsible for performance
not the chipset if you tuned every
single setting in BIOS and use 2
otherwise identical motherboards you'd
get about the same performance the same
is true for the r7 2700 X with guile
memory here where we observed
performance differences within a margin
of error ashes of the singularity tends
to be somewhat memory intensive and
shows the same exact trend on the 1700 X
as we saw previously there's no change
from other games for the most part the
2700 accent ashes is also similar where
we've seen better performance on X 370
with guile as a result of better memory
auto timings on a Seuss's half as
demonstrated in the previous chart with
the coarser memory it all equalizes once
you have controlled timings blender
produced the same kind of result scaling
he saw his 0.1 minute difference on the
2700 X when tested with Corsair memory
timings controlled there's no chipset
impact at all he saw a 0.2 minute
difference within error with the 1700 X
so there you have it
differences emerge from things like the
board quality primarily not just that we
could not find a simple chipset
difference in terms of your frame rate
or things like that
not with a 1,700 ax not with a 2,700 X
and yes it's entirely possible there are
differences that are more worthy of note
but we could not find any for
performance it's not we obviously didn't
test every single application in the
world that said for consumer gaming
things like that don't sweat it
the thing you should be concerned about
is the vrm quality for example the
gaming sevens got a pretty good VRM but
it's also kind of weak in the BIOS
Department they're getting better
they're good enough for most users but
both of those parts of the equation
matter a lot and that's really what the
difference comes down to is who's got
the best memory support for the kit
you're buying and you should check every
vendors memory support official
validated list when you buy your memory
that's something that I think a lot of
people probably overlooked in the
building process because it seems like
memory is kind of memory but that's I
mean although that's true to an extent
the motherboard vendors are ultimately
responsible for making sure the memory
you're using is properly configured for
the lower level Auto timings unless you
want to do that yourself and that's the
takeaway it's for the most part there's
no difference a to be with the chipsets
that we can presently find and to
properly test that you would need
basically this motherboard in identical
form and I would need a socketable
chipset that I can just pop in and out
as I desired for testing that's what
you'd really need for a perfect test but
we got close enough to tell you that the
motherboards are the difference not
really the chipset which is more or less
what we said previously and our pre
review content and a review content so
that's it for this one subscribe for
more as always go to patreon.com/scishow
and axis top that directly go to store
dock gamers Nexus dotnet to pick up a
mod mat like this one we're really happy
with how their sign doing quite well
we'll have another round of them in the
next couple of weeks shipping out to you
guys so thanks for the back orders and
for watching I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
