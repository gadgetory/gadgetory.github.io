net and today we're talking about an
enter max case this is the edimax lipa
lennox case or the lennox 801 pc case
lipa is a brand of enermax and the case
we're looking at here today is annie ATX
full tower so it's fairly large
certainly not as big as the rosel b-2
spirit that we will be looking at
shortly but it is a larger case and that
classifies it as a full tower the case
MSRP is 160 dollars it's currently
selling for 170 on amazon but in theory
that should drop to 160 through other
retailers as i know my continues to see
the case and for basic specs the unit
ships with three fans to 200 millimeter
fans one on the top one in the front
both of those are blue LED fans and then
11 hundred forty millimeter fan in the
rear and all three fans can connect to a
fan controller which is a three-step fan
controller so it's got a low medium and
high setting we tested all three of
these and we also tested additional fan
support so you can install bottom fans
in the case including 2 120 millimeter
bottom fans so we tested if we had one
fan to this case how much of an impact
does a 120-millimeter in the bottom
actually grant to performance and that's
something we look at later the case has
a lot of extras and some of those
include a USB charger port at the top
that's actually a 2.4 amp port which is
pretty high and this is meant to be used
for charging mobile devices cell phones
things like that so for frame of
reference I have a moto x cell phone my
charger for my Moto X is about 1.2 amps
this puts out 2.4 amps so it will charge
much faster but the charge will have
less staying power and it's really not
that great for the lithium-ion battery
but if you wanted a very quick charge
because you're about to run out the door
or something then this does have a port
that does that a lot of modern
motherboards support this functionality
as well other features include a hot
swap 2.5 inch SSD bay here in the front
which is actually pretty cool because if
you're spending one hundred sixty
dollars on the case you may actually be
in a position where you have a hot swap
2.5 inch drive SSD or not
in that case you just plug it in the
front it's pre-wired to Sita and then
all you have to do is basically go
through windows and access the drive
there's no damage that inherently occurs
from unplugging or plugging in a drive
when the motherboard in the case and the
drive itself I'll support that
functionality so you've got that there
and then on the back of the case there
is a handle that's coated in rubber
pretty nice so that means that you can
actually lift the fairly heavy case and
system up from the back using a steel
support beam rather than pulling on this
plastic paddling that a lot of cases
will force you to do speaking of the
paneling it's coated in a soft grip
rubber pants so the top and the front
are coated in this paint it's actually a
very expensive paint and that's part of
what contributes to a high cost of the
case the side panels are standard steel
coated with a matte black paint and
there's a slight difference in the color
between the metal and the plastic which
I really wish didn't exist because the
difference is it's really not a big deal
but i would rather a more uniform look
unfortunately that is basically an
unavoidable issue when you're dealing
with different materials for the
paddling and the side paneling so that's
what you've got there the soft grip
rubber actually does have a very nice
feel to it and the aesthetic is pretty
good i originally thought that this case
would appear more plasticky because of
the molding of the front of the top
panels they are definitely of the gamer
aesthetic but with the soft grip rubber
it does come out looking a little bit
more professional and sleeker than the
average low-end plasticky case the specs
are relatively standard otherwise the
front door does this action right here
which all that does is hide your optical
drives if you don't want to show them or
if you're not using them and there are
three five and a quarter inch base here
definitely something we've moved away
from but it is a feature that some users
still demand enter max gets a lot of
things right with the leap at lenox case
and some of those things include a told
space to allow head-on access to
expansion slots so you don't have to put
the screwdriver in at an angle when
installing video cards and other
expansion devices which reduces risk of
cross threading
the rear grip with the rubber coating is
definitely a big plus and a small
feature that they added for which I am
grateful the split top panel is actually
pretty cool as well so the top panel
mounts on Rails and it's split it to a
to third section in a one third section
the two third section of the back you
just unscrew two thumb screws and then
slide it off the rails pull it off and
you have instant access to the radiator
install and top fans if those are of
interest for replacement so that is
definitely something I was a fan of and
I wish more cases would put their top
paneling on rails in a similar capacity
because it makes it easier to work with
finally enter max puts the SSD trays on
the rear of the motherboard so you've
got some of those back there just like
NZXT does on its cases and a lot of
other manufacturers ease of
installations fairly standard no major
complaints there it's pretty easy to
install case it's mostly to lyst there
is one instance where i thought the
cable management could be improved by
enermax and that would be to add a
second cut out near the cpu so the cpu
power pinouts on motherboards are
normally located either in the top left
of the board meaning top left of the the
cpu or in the center above the cpu or a
little more to the right if you have a
certain larger board like EA to export
so the asus rampage as an example is one
of the boards we have that has its power
pin outs for the cpu located due north
of the cpu on this case the way to get
to that would be basically to go through
one of the other side flanking cutouts
so you're going to have to sort of
awkwardly install the power supply cable
this is really not a huge deal it does
not functionally impact the case all it
does is impacted mostly aesthetically
because you've got to grab the cable
through more open space now so it's
exposed and it doesn't look as good but
that is a small feature that NZ ft and
Corsair have caught on to and I think
enermax would benefit from as well and
then another small downside is that
because of the high pressure output in
the rear exhaust fan we end up with a
sort of high-volume exchange of air on a
lower end fan with a
mesh in front of it and what that does
because the fan is not optimized with a
frictionless coating or with a better
slipstream as some of the higher-end
fans do have like Silverstone's fans and
be quiet fans for instance the rear fan
ends up making a lot of noise and it's
not really an irritating noise as much
as it's a deep hum it's a low frequency
output it's fairly loud and that's from
forcing all that air through a port that
has a mesh and you get sort of
turbulence in there that creates the
noise so this is something that could be
easily improved by changing the fan in
the case and it's something that enermax
should perhaps look into in the future
but not a major issue if you lower the
RPM of that fan let's move on to the
thermal benchmarks over time and the
equilibrium benchmarks and then conclude
the case review here the lipa lennox
cools marginally better than the Noctis
454 cpu and GPU temperatures outputting
48.4 to celsius of heat on the cpu at
equilibrium and 20.6 celsius on the GPU
at equilibrium looking at the
temperature over time charts our
automated tests align the benchmark
perfectly and show the lenox is slightly
warmer than the fan tax many XL we later
found that it's also warmer than the b-2
spirit we're testing a number of other
cases in the background and we tested
the fan controller on all three settings
for the Lennox low medium high finding
that the thermals aren't effectively
identical on all these this is likely
due to a bottleneck created by the thick
plastic bars on the front and top of the
case which restrict air intake to the
point that it throttles the fan
potential more than the controller does
so to this end you're really better off
just kind of leaving the fan controller
one setting and ignoring it when we
added a 120-millimeter 1200 RPM bottom
fan we saw a 14 Celsius improvement and
CPU thermals which is a gigantic change
and that is potentially an oversight by
utter max it's definitely something we
think should be included stock and if it
isn't then you should be buying one
pretty early in the process because it's
a big cooling difference overall the
case impressed me with its feel of the
coating and look
really was expecting something much more
plastic e and a lower quality aesthetic
but that is not what we got here
thankfully it's actually a pretty nice
appearance overall and the thermals are
average they're par for the course
nothing special there but the extras on
the case are well thought out and show a
an attention to detail for smaller items
that I think enermax deserve some notice
for the front SSD port the supercharger
in the top and then my favorite is just
the small handle and the rails for the
top panel of the case those are all
small things that definitely don't make
the case functionally better from a
cooling perspective but Portability and
other things it adds a bit of character
the biggest downfall of the leap at
lenox case is its price point at one
hundred sixty dollars MSRP and 170
retail through amazon and newegg right
now the case is actually in direct
competition with some heavyweights in
the industry including Corsair 760 T
which is actually one of my favorite
cases right now and that has a heavier
use of rigid strong metals it has a very
large tempered glass side panel there's
slightly different markets for each of
these cases but coarser definitely is a
bigger name and they're going to have
some power in that department other
cases around the same price point would
include the NZXT noxus 450 that's a
hundred forty dollars it is a smaller
case but it does compete in the gamer
aesthetic category in terms of
appearances for cases and then there's
also rose wells be to spear which is
gigantic it's bigger than this and it's
sort of a mini server setup if you have
a lot of hard drive so there are a lot
of different options at this price point
some of them are more direct competition
than others but at the end of the day
comes down to preference for aesthetics
because structurally and in terms of
functionality this case is at least on
par with the others if not slightly
ahead in some areas the plastic coating
is a plus that some other companies
haven't figured out yet or just don't
want to pay for so there's pros and cons
to all of them I would feel fine
endorsing this case I wish the price
point where 100
forty dollars instead because at 160 I'm
probably a buyer of the 760 tea instead
or even some of Silverstone's cases are
cheaper and like the Raven 05 is a very
good option that has more focus on
cooling functionality than this case
does so it's not a bad case it just has
a lot of fierce competition and the main
reason just like this case or really any
other one in a direct competition is
because you like the look of it and the
look and feel of the plastic so that is
the lipa Lennox case it is the 801 p ck
