question we asked Intel at their press
day it's not compatible with LGA 1151 it
works with more expensive motherboards
and half of the components on the board
will go on use for example four of these
dims you can't use with Kb like eggs and
then part of the PCIe devices as well if
you're planning to populate them so
those features aren't free to the
consumer you pay for all the stuff on
the board but the CPU can't drive them
so it ends up in a very weird part of
the market we asked Intel about why this
product exists and why it's 2066 and not
1151 we'll have an answer for you in a
moment but if you look under the dye
even the top part of the substrate looks
pretty familiar so we're not fully
convinced that this product needs to
exist in the package it does but we're
going to be here reviewing it anyway
looking through thermals gaming
performance and more before getting to
that this video is brought to you by
ifixit.com and the pc essentials toolkit
which can be had for $20 making it one
of their cheapest yet most complete
toolkits use code gamers nexus for $5
off to bring that to 15 you can go to
ifixit.com slash gamers nexus or click
the link below for more information
getting into this dana intel's answer to
our query which was why does this kb
lake axe exist was that it allows it
consumers to get into the high-end
desktop platforms like $2.99 at a lower
price point so that they can upgrade
later to the higher-end cpus this we
think is a little misguided but that was
their answer there are a few things we
could speculate from here but first of
all the misguided part here's the thing
if you're spending 330 dollars anyway on
a CPU which is functionally the same as
a 70 time 100k except for actually
they've stripped out the IGP but
otherwise functionally the same once you
have $330 on the CPU you're kind of out
of territory where you're going to throw
it away or even just move it to another
build and buy a different one later
because if you're spending 300 bucks on
this and 300 plus on a board might even
end up with a board that's more
expensive than the CPU in this series of
of chipset and platform once you are
there it's time to stop
pretending and go properly high-end this
chip and I 777 40 X is considered low
end when coupled with something like
this ever 77 RK which is what this is
really isn't a low-end processor it's
not but when you pair it with one of
these it becomes a lone processor and
the pairing doesn't make any sense this
is especially true for the i-5 76 40 X
which we will probably not be reviewing
because it's also it definitely
shouldn't exist that one we know for
sure should not be a CPU you can buy for
this so one or the other either you have
high-end CPUs for high-end boards or you
fill those audiences which is kind of
what the existing i7 line does so that's
that's the positioning for these
platforms and it's not a mid step it's
just weird
this isn't like the G 45 60 where it
might make sense to buy it with a Z 270
board and upgrade in a year now it's a
bit worse than the hex you're spending
so much money on the motherboard and
half the features are unusable more
realistically we think that intel is
trying to work toward merging its
high-end enthusiast products by eighth
generation we wouldn't be surprised if
we start seeing things like these 7700 K
equivalent chips moved permanently to
x-class hardware at least if there's not
enough push back but that answers why
Intel thinks KB like X exists of course
shows that we don't necessarily agree
but it's just ultimately more confusing
for end-users as for the differences
between the 7700 KMA 7 study for TX
here's a chart that shows them don't
look too hard because there's really not
many differences it's the base frequency
that's the one at the 740 X climbs to
4.3 gigahertz from 4.2 was boost at 4.5
on both and they're still using dual
channel memory controllers despite being
on the X rays platform so again only
four DIMMs are available and also
they're still both limited to 16 PCIe
lanes on the CPU itself the last major
difference is that the socket type
changed its 2066 a few things with this
the exterior chipsets are more expensive
for the producer of the motherboard
which means it's more expensive for you
and the sockets more expensive just like
a.m. these thread ripper sockets more
expense
it's more metal so it cost more money so
the socket type changes you can't use
one of these with the Z series platforms
otherwise this might make a little more
sense a is just a standard refresh
nothing wrong with 100 megahertz bump
but it's a little worse than that
obviously because we're looking at a new
motherboard one more big change though
the IGP again is gone
so this is where intel's argument gets a
little nebulous because they have said
the intention of these cpus is to buy it
discard it or relocate it and then put a
better cpu in the system with the
intention being the upgrade later if
your intention is to upgrade later why
not provide an igt if i'm the type of
person who's going to upgrade a cpu
later then i probably might want to just
sit around and wait to buy a video card
to in which case my GP would make this
more arguable for intel you can't do
that here though there's no means of
troubleshooting and look we don't
normally like the iGPS we don't even
talk about them in the reviews of the
case cube part but the reason it's being
talked about now is because it was
removed and i'm not sure there was a
functional reason to do so so it does
just kind of seem weird and it's not
like the price went down for the
consumer if this cpu we're $30 cheaper
than the 7700 k that kind of makes sense
and then you can at least mentally tell
yourself ok it i'm saving $30 on the cpu
so i can invest there anymore on the
motherboard or something like that but
that's not how it works here that should
largely outline our stance on the cpu
let's look at the benchmark numbers
starting with thermals and as always you
can find our full testing methodology
link in the description below the
thermals here we're using a crack in X
50 to completely max out on the fans and
the pump we've used this for our
thermals for some time now and we're
also logging liquid temperature which
allows us to look at the Delta between
the liquid temperature the CPU package
and the CPU cores so we can figure out
how well the CPU die is transferring its
heat to the IHS and then into the cooler
starting with just the 77 40 X and its
stock configuration with a navy X
workload we found that the CPU tended to
operate around 1.7 7v core when Auto V
core was used on our ACS prime board and
it does change per board and that was
with a CPU temperature peaking at around
75 to 76 Celsius on the package
for about 74 to 75 C for a peak averaged
core temperature in this time our liquid
temperature only increases from about 29
or 30 C to about 35 C for a delta of
about 6 C start to end of the test the
last time we showed this data was for
the 77 100 K review when we noted that
the 7700 K was running pretty hot even
compared to its 6700 K predecessor part
of this seems to be that there's poor
transfer from the CDs diets of IH s on
the cooler as the liquid temperature
doesn't really move all that much even
when testing it for an hour and again
this is with a crack in X 62 maxed out
and we're still around 74 to 75 C so
let's CPU runs hot if we were to drop
the fan speeds around 1050 rpm which is
pretty bearable and you can see in our
CPU cooler testing the temperatures
would rise substantially to the point
where it really wouldn't be worth
dropping the fan speed and less powerful
coolers wouldn't be as effective
comparing now to the overclocked version
of the CPU at 5.1 gigahertz with a V
core of one point three seven we're
looking at a temperature that's bumping
into the 100 Celsius TJ Max limiter
causing severe clock jobs that bring
down our OC the chip can clearly handle
it but we need a lot more than even a
280 millimeter cooler with maxed out fan
and pomp RPMs in a room with an ambient
of about 22 to 23 C so it's again pretty
hot we just weren't stable below one
point three seven volts and at least
with the five point one gigahertz clock
for AVX instructions but we were stable
at one point three five for non AVX
instructions the next interesting
comparison will be between the 7700 K
and the 77 40 X this is the last one
we're publishing for now but we do have
a lot more data to dig into for some
future content for this comparison both
CPUs are clocked to 4.5 gigahertz with a
1.2 volts v core and we're running non
AVX thermal test to compare these non
AVX thermals between the CPUs they're
roughly the same when at the same
voltage 1.2 0 volts with about a 68 to
70 Celsius range most differences in
thermals between the two CPUs can be
attributed to motherboard changes
primarily motherboard Auto V core that
might run a higher voltage on one socket
than the other more thermal discussion
in the link in the description below as
always but now we're going to move on to
a few
test before getting to these this CPU
again is basically at 7700 KS so we're
going to be comparing that primarily to
a 7700 K to show when and if there are
differences because of that there won't
be a lot of discussion comparing it to
other parts and that's not because we
hate the other parts it's because they
were compared against already in our
Aizen 5 reviews so if you would like to
see discussion on the non 77 X X parts
then check the r5 1600 X review and
check the I 970 900 X review for the
most up-to-date data and comparison on
all of those today it's a focus on the
277 blank chips 100k and 40 X so that we
can see how these scaling looks and if
it's worth putting it this 7700 K on a
three hundred plus dollar motherboard
let's look at blender next the i7 7740 x
stock cpu completes our scene render in
42 minutes which is basically the same
as the I 777 hard case forty two point
four minute result basically the same
overclocking that 77 40 X gets us to 37
about 1 minutes for an improvement in
performance of about 13 percent over
baseline then again you shouldn't buy
either of these CPS or blender rendering
anyway it's just a good tool to look at
the difference between them if rendering
is the primary goal the r7 1700 would do
significantly better at 33 minutes and
would cost the same and then you can
overclock it granted the i7 series CPUs
do time to hold an advantage in gaming
but we'll get there looking at fire
strike next the 77 40 X runs a physics
frame rate of 40 6.49 FPS with the 77
higher KS stock CPU at 45.96 fps
this is within test to test variants
actually and isn't release exam can't
difference overclocking gets us to 50
2.44 and 50 2.16 FPS on the X and case
Keys respectively both at 5.1 gigahertz
so again the same sorting by physics
scores instead shows us the same thing
the 77 40 X with its 14,000 645 score is
about 1.2 percent ahead of the 7700 K
with time spy it's more of the same 77
40 Xbox CPU runs the CPU frame rate of
20 FPS with the 7700 K SR CPU at
nineteen point six six FPS for the same
test let's say 1.7 percent difference
overclocking gets us to
1.88 FPS versus 21.4 FPS ami 7700 KOC
cpu ashes of the singularity is our next
synthetic test with dx12 and puts the
7740 x stock CPF 42.4 FPS for our 1080p
high test with lows at 33 9 and 31 FPS
0.1% the 77 100k runs its average at 41
point 5 FPS lows 32.7 and 39 1 and 0.1%
that puts the 77 40 X at 2% I have this
7 700 K CPU a little bit boring there so
we'll move on to ashes escalation which
we haven't fully updated with all our
CPUs yes but it does have the 1700 K
stock CPU at 40 4.3 FPS average 36.4 1%
low and 33 2 is your boundary so close
the 77 40 X is measurably but
imperceptibly better at 40 4.8 m/s
average or 1.1 percent faster this
change like all the others could largely
be chalked up to the fact that even just
the motherboards are different so there
might be differences in things like DBC
latency and other aspects of the board
Grand Theft Auto 5 isn't much different
the stock 77 40 X measured at 149 FPS
average with 108 fps 1% blows with these
7700 K stock CPU at 149 the to
overclocked skis are different by less
than 1 FPS and are within tests of test
variants they are effectively identical
there are more gaming results in the
article
normally we would go through at least
one or two more of them here consider
Nash's is basically synthetic but to
save you the time they're all the same
the difference between these CPUs is
barely there at all
sometimes the 70 time one hard K is in
the lead in some of the games sometimes
this one's in the lead and when I say in
the lead I mean the bar is bigger but
that doesn't mean that it's outside of
test variants and there's plenty of
differences just in the motherboards for
example the maturity of this chipset X
299 is not quite as far along as the 270
so there are instances where we saw
improved performance on the 77 hard K V
270 platform then on this one even
though they're technically the same
clock and solve that is the chipsets
being different solve it is the maturity
of the drivers but at the end of the day
we'll come out to be about the same fps
so no point in going through more of it
as for the conclusion on this CPU the i7
7740 X it's very plain and simple this
isn't worth buying do not buy it if you
want to buy a CPU that is really gaming
focus from Intel the 7700 K with a Z 270
it makes a lot more sense the CPUs
themselves are the same price let's say
that this CPU were somehow attainable or
obtainable on the z 270 platform if you
could get one of these on z2 70 would it
be worth buying well probably not it
depends but ultimately even if they were
on the same platform they cost the same
price and they were both being sold
alongside one another what you end up
with is a 100 mega Hertz faster base
totally irrelevant for most of us
because if you're gaming it's probably
going to be pinned at 4.5 anyway and
that's the same on both of them and you
lose the IGP
and technically the TDP rating on this
is higher on this one than the other
I don't know why maybe the base clock
pushes it the extra 20 or so watts or
maybe they're just accounting for the
high temperature scenarios that the 7700
K exhibited but either way the only real
difference is that IGP and a hundred
megahertz on the base so it's not worth
buying this waste of money to get it for
the X 299 platform if you want to buy
the X 299 platform there are some really
good motherboards out there putting this
on it would just really be an insult to
the board's so if you go X 299 get a
good board for it and then get a decent
cpu for it doesn't have to be a 10 core
but something better than these so that
you can actually use everything on the
board and then then you have a platform
that might be worth using there are
still some reasons that X 299 isn't
perfect we talked about those in the
7900 X review and he gives them quite a
run for their money in the consumer
department where you might be rendering
in blender or whatever as a freelancer
or a semi professional or someone who
doesn't work for a large studio where
you'll have workstations with Intel
products but for
most of our audience things like
rendering Rison is quite good at it for
things like gaming the 7700 K is as good
as this on a cheaper platform and it's
way more streamlined and less confusing
with more mature drivers a more mature
chipset and the driver support from the
motherboard vendors and they've gone
through all their revisions to fix all
the problems with the first round of
boards so that's the best way to go if
you don't want to screw around with
things and you just want to play games
with a high frame rate and that's it so
