covering the show and we've still got
about five videos following this one to
go up with show coverage so it's been a
big week for us this time we are talking
about some more am4 motherboards this
time from asrock biostar and Maxon we've
already covered MSI and gigabyte so you
can check the channel for that coverage
before getting to the new am for
motherboards that this video is brought
to you by cyber power and their cyber XL
gaming pc which has an invertible
motherboard tray layout you can learn
more in the description below so as
we've said a few times now there are
three main chipsets for the am4 platform
that would be x3 70 of the high-end B
350 of the mid-range area and then a 320
at the low end which would be about
equivalent to an a 68 previously and
then there's the extra X 300 chipset
which is not so much a chipset as just a
chip used for security boot it doesn't
really do any i/o functions that is
going to be on the Mini ITX motherboards
we did not see any of those I don't
think anyway on the show there were a
lot of motherboards I did not see any
mini ITX so for today we're talking
about the let's start with the Macs on
board this is a Chinese brand
you probably don't really hear about it
in the US but they had one or two boards
at the AMD booth at CES pretty
straightforward eight pin power header
it looks like a total of six phases that
might I don't know if that's a 4 plus 2
or 5 plus 1 because we there were no
representatives there but six total
phases it looks like the rest of the
specs were the well actually the most
immediately interesting thing that you
noticed looking at the board is
something that AMD didn't want to talk
to me about the board says that it
supports quote an AMD s3 radiator so
from what I understand there will be a
couple of different cooling solutions
for AMD CPUs we'll have a separate video
on this the s3 radiator as the
motherboard would suggest probably is a
liquid cooler and I would have to
imagine that as 3 would be for the
higher-end SKUs from the maybe rise in 8
core 16 thread SKUs or something else
I'm not sure what but it's going to be a
liquid cooler of some kind probably some
kind of AMD made or branded device
anyway
knows which vendor could be cool it or a
Sutekh or coolermaster any of them but
that's kind of interesting on just a
side point the rest of the specs to the
board it looks like four SATA 3 ports so
that would be your six gigabits per
second there's USB 3.1 gen2 on support
and just again to kind of reiterate USB
3.1 gen2 on there are some differences
from just saying USB 3.0 but for the
most part it is a nomenclature change
there a couple of differences but the
speed is the same so it's so about five
gigabits per second 4.8 something like
that there's a clear CMOS button there's
a comport for some reason I guess well
it's a Chinese board and they tend to
have more of those on there because if
they're selling to market in China then
there's there's reason to actually
support there's older interfaces to m
dot 2 ports and those are PCIe X 2 so
they're a bit lower in terms of the lane
assignment and then there's one that's a
two three as far as Biostar Biostar has
a couple of GT series boards they're
racing boards with checkered flags and
things like that which I guess isn't
that much worse than like gaming boards
that are everywhere the GT boards are in
gt3 five or seven I'm not sure which one
we were looking at but it is a be 350
board the GT 7 board is an X 370 layout
so this is either 5 or 3 that we saw in
person did not have a rep or labeling on
the board to tell us which one
specifically but it looks like a total
of seven phases maybe six for the CPU
and maybe one for the GPU something like
that it does include push buttons for
modes that are called eco and sport and
then it's got a reset and power button
on the board as well so eco and sport
probably requires software to trigger
it's normally some kind of pre OC and
some kind of lowered voltage option
there's a multi BIOS toggle switch which
is interesting don't see those too much
on the mid-range and low-end boards and
then there's something called a 50-50
RGB LED ports and that's near the USB
3.0 header so I guess we can't escape
LEDs they will be on this board as well
or at least supported externally
speaking of the USB 3 header there are
solder points for a second USB 3 header
that's kind of interesting there's one
on here but it's not the only board that
Oh is multiple USB three front panel
connector options so that does look to
be the way that things are going this
looks like it might be the same PCB
that's used for the actually seventy
board which we didn't see and if it is
that slot might be populated as rock as
our CAD four main motherboards at the
CES event in total but I think we only
saw three at AMD suite or booth or
whatever you call it they had the X 370
taiichi the X 370 gaming k4 and the be
350 gaming k4 and then an a320 M pro for
the M signifying that it is micro ATX
not full ATX the k4 in the X 370 models
both have the fatality branding with red
and black coloring the X 370 Tai Chi
sort of a higher-end board for the
lineup from asrock it has a ton of
inductors I'm not sure exactly what the
phase design is at this time it's a lot
it looks like about 16 total inductors
so whether that's total phases or
they're doing some kind of doubling or
something like that I'm not clear on
right now seems to use the same
reinforced PCIe slots that we're seeing
on everything now even though a couple
of companies are trying to patent it
good luck with that at this point PCIe
slots are wired if you look at them
closely the full-length PCIe slots are
wired for x16 x8 and x4 and it does look
like it has some sort of muxing
capabilities to make multi-gpu more more
compatible I suppose with the Lane
availability the asrock purity sound
marketing language is present on the
motherboard eight SATA ports 4x4 m dot 2
lanes using the ultra m2 slot a seven
segment display and then my favorite
part is the giant Intel logo on the side
of the board which is four Gigabit
Ethernet next as rocks got the X 370 Pro
gaming fatality motherboard this also
looks like a 16 total power phase design
through the inductors at least we'd have
to probe it to really know more it's got
a single power connector so even though
it's got this insane VRM whether or not
it's actually good we'll see but huge
vrm still eight pins for the power which
on the MSI titanium motherboard the X
power board we saw that was an eight
plus
for some curious to see how much that
actually matters in overclocking PCIe
reinforcement again on the X 370 Pro
gaming fatality to full I'm about two
slots one of which at least is rated for
PCIe gen3 by four and then the slots are
again wired for x16 x8 next for in PCIe
and also looks like there might be a
multiplexer on the board might be the
same board as the Taichi just with
different colors and a few different
soldered on items SM DS and things like
that but the board itself looks pretty
much the same and we're down to just two
left there's the gaming k4 which is a be
350 chipset this will be a cheaper board
looks like something maybe 1/8 plus one
set up for something like that and it's
got again a reinforced PCIe slot there's
just one of them assignments x16 the
other is just x4 so there's no x8 here
but with be 350 you can't really do
multi-gpu anyway so it doesn't matter
the m-dot 2 slots are present in the
form of at least one using PCIe gen3 4x4
lanes there's two total m2 slots
looks like six SATA three slots or ports
and then it's a single GPU motherboard
pretty basic
finally the a 320m pro 4 is another
asrock board this one is micro ATX it
has four dimm slots not quite many ITX
so they can fit more on there another 8
pin power connector for the CPU there's
a very cleanly hidden RGB LED pin out at
the top so I think that's becoming
somewhat standardized at this point
where it can support at least the
external strips that you plug into the
board if it doesn't come with its own 4
SATA ports one USB 3 header and 2 m dot
two slots on the motherboard and that
covers it so that's what we had for all
of the am 4 boards that I'm aware of
that we're at CES we covered gigabyte we
covered MSI previously there are two
other MSI boards we didn't talk about in
the video but we've got some discussion
and articles on gamers Nexus net and now
we've got asrock biostar and Mac's on so
that about covers it
check back we'll still be posting 2 days
2 videos a day for at least a few days
now because we've got a lot packed up
from CES as always subscribe for more
