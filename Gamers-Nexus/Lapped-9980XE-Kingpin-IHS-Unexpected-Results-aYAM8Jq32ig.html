references into the creation of our 99
80 X II kingpin Edition CPU which used
the expert overclockers sanding stones
to grind down the CPU with near-perfect
flatness this is useful for improving
contact to ellentube pots under extreme
cooling conditions but can also flatten
the cooler and remove unnecessary
material in a way that improves ambient
cooling capabilities
today's testing looks at that aspect of
things trying to narrow down what kind
of improvement a nearly perfectly
laughte CPU can post before that this
video is brought to you by be quiet and
it's straight power 11 series power
supplies the straight power 11 PSU is
shipped from 450 Watts up to a thousand
Watts accommodating most of the gaming
PC build requirements you'd encounter
and focuses on delivering a higher
quality power supply that doesn't
sacrifice on efficiency or stability
noise is also a heavy point for the
straight power 11 using a 135
millimeters silent wins three fan that
can spin as low as 200 rpm for quieter
low load operation learn more at the
link in the description below this
process we'll be discussing two things
with the lapping of the IHS there's
obviously an expectation that you
potentially improve thermals and it's
from two different aspects of the
process one of them is you're reducing
the actual material between the die and
the ultimate cooling solution and
ideally you want as few thermal
interfaces as possible between the die
and what's cooling it so in a perfect
world what you do is direct eye contact
or even more perfect you might just
solder a cooling solution directly to
the die but that's not how reality works
so in reality what we end up with is you
could do a direct die you would deal it
it and then you get a really fine finely
made direct eye kit that has tight
tolerances so that you don't
accidentally crack the die and then you
put the cooling solution on top of that
at that point you don't really need the
liquid metal anymore because you're so
close to the source of heat which is the
silicon that has a high thermal
conductivity about 200 watts per meter
Kelvin that you can use a thin layer of
pace and you'll be in good shape now the
other thing here though is that you
might expect an improvement in thermals
from lapping a CPU yhs because
has now potentially levelled out the
thickness of the IHS or at least the
concavity of the IHS so in our scenario
what we were dealing with was an IHS
that appeared from working with kingpin
on sanding it to be very uneven in fact
there were three really tall points and
we have footage of that where the IHS
just took significantly longer to sand
down the rest of it and I just realized
I haven't mentioned all this on the
table coolermaster played a joke on us
we'll talk about this later but anyway
so that's one of the bigger things is
that if you have high core - Kordell
toes they're kind of two main theories
as to why that might be and one of them
is the IHS is imperfect to a point that
the cooling material on one side is much
thicker than on the other side of the
IHS that create thermal gaps or Delta's
that are large and then the the other
theory is that internally under the IHS
there's a thicker layer of solder than
is truly necessary or something to that
effect the real reason that people like
kingpin laugh the IHS though is not to
try and gain a couple of degrees or
reduce temperature by a couple of
degrees when you're cooling with
ambience when you're doing liquid
cooling or something like that it's just
it's it's not what they're after
so what kingpin is after is improving
the contact between the ellentube pot
and the IHS by flattening both of those
surfaces so they contact each other
pretty directly and then he might even
scuff it up a bit to improve some
contact area give some some extra grip
for the thermal paste to grab on to and
then the reason for that is to reduce
the chance of the thermal paste cracking
when it's under the liquid nitrogen
where you're going to be in the
negatives you might be minus 100 degrees
Celsius or lower so that's what he's
going for which is different from what a
lot of people are trying to achieve when
they lap the CPU for normal use and what
we're testing is what's the improvement
in normal use it's not going to be a ton
we've done this before but now we're
doing it with a more perfect approach by
using the sanding discs that can been
had in reality what we've done is
prepare the CPU for better use with
liquid nitrogen because we've flattened
the surface so the contact
between the the cooler the Ellen teapot
and my chess is less likely to a gap in
a way that causes the pace to crack and
require reheating it with a heat gun or
just removing the pot and putting new
Allen to orden you paste on it for the
next Allen to run so that's really
what's happened but let's go through the
test data and see if it's improved in
any meaningful way for air cooling by
which we mean liquid cooling but using
ambient air so we're not using any
extreme cooling solutions here just a
crack in X 60 to 280 millimeter cooler
and then we'll have additional test
bench details in the article linked in
the description below in our four point
four get your Hertz 1.15 volt tests a
light overclock that can be reasonably
cooled on the X 62 we found our
unmodified Intel I 999 ATX II CPU to
perform at 86 degrees Celsius for
package temperature with liquid
temperature at 39 degrees and average
core load temperature at 75 degrees
Celsius now if that ambient is logged
for all tests ambient was controlled to
three tenths of a degree for these tests
as a refresher deal it in a 79 80 X E
and adding liquid metal got it down to
67 degrees Celsius core and so D 4
degrees Celsius package this is
something we previously covered but the
advantage to the 79 80 XE is twofold
it's easier to deal it so cooling that
is not sub ambience is improved with a
reduced gap between the die my HS and
it's also using a thinner interface of
liquid metal in this instance there are
downsides to but as shown in some of our
b-roll of the deal editing process the
79 80 X
II CPUs are the same as the 99 80 X YZ
except that the IHS is secured with
paste and silicone rather than indium
solder so it's just silicone adhesive
and thermal paste on that 7000 series
once the silicone adhesive is removed
the die to IHS gap is reduced and that's
further improved when using two thin
layers of liquid metal as the contact
media the 99 ATX EE meanwhile has
potentially more distance between the
die and IHS as a result of the soldering
process this is why we see such large
improvements on the 79 80 XE we're
reducing the distance and improving the
interface and that's really the benefit
of it
back to the chart the 99 ATX e and the
79 ad XE really showed their gap when
set to 4.6 gigahertz and 1.2 4 volts
core which is an awful terrible
configuration but one which we use to
artificially stress the CPU under AVX
loads that thermal Delta is noticeable
here going to our kingpin tests we see a
reduction from the 1990 DX e is eighty
six point two degree baseline package
temperature to eighty three point one
degrees in the final like-for-like test
we did some additional tests with newer
thermal paste batches than the one we
originally used for the pre lab testing
finding performance falling within a
single degree of variation for each one
the package temperature improved by
about two to three degrees Celsius
depending on test versus the baseline
benchmark this is a good improvement
from just removing a layer of nickel and
flattening the copper interface we
emailed experts kingpin and ten about
this and received confirmation that a
two degree reduction is common for CPU
lapping but we also received a lesson on
the greater item of importance a flatter
interface for liquid nitrogen cooling
solutions is really the reason that
these CPUs get lapped tin told us the
following quote while we hoped for more
significant results two degrees Celsius
is quite usual for us the problem with
non flat CPUs lies in a different route
when you get too much grease filling
voids between the flat CPU Allen to pot
and the curved IHS it's more prone to
crack and lose good thermal contact
making CPU overclocking on at
liquid-nitrogen poor with lapped flat
CPU integrated heat spreaders and flat
pot bases this almost never happens even
when benching 18 cores at 6 gigahertz by
the way with little CPUs like 1151 this
is a much worse issue due to high power
density versus the area we also
previously discussed this with Joe
Stefan Z who pre lapped all of his Allen
teapots and CPUs before starting
benchmarking in our initial bench build
when we were working with Stefan Z on
our Alan two efforts we asked why the
lapping was needed at all when working
with liquid nitrogen because at that
point it seems like a couple of degrees
is sort of a pointless reduction the
answer was the same this can reduce the
chance of paste cracking during testing
means that contact loss is less likely
when under extreme temperatures with
large sub-zero temperature swings the
end result is that our lapped 18 core
CPU Falls with an expected range of what
kingpin and 10 C for the average
temperature reduction just from lapping
but beyond that the CPU is now more
suitable for future liquid-nitrogen
overclocking as its service is much
flatter and if you want to see our
efforts with Joe previously we have a
video preparing and recapping for the
live stream that we did with liquid
nitrogen but for smaller CPUs like the
normal case q desktop CPUs the
difference might be marginally higher
than what we saw as a result of the
increased power density in that tiny
area but overall the real difference
here is that the improvement is in a
time reduction versus the manual sanding
approach which can take hours and the
thermal reduction being about the same
versus a perfect manual laughs the big
question now is whether we improved the
core to core Delta because that's where
we saw the worst performance in our
original testing for core to core doubts
as we previously observed the max versus
minimum core difference of about 39
degrees on the 99 ATX II went under a
stress test that pegged us to the
maximum package temperature
it's about 104 degrees Celsius more
reasonably under the 4.4 gigahertz and
1.15 volt overclocks we were closer to a
30-degree delta across all of our 99 ATX
e tests this is about the same even the
79 t DX II only saw an improvement to 25
degrees core decor when we use the
liquid metal with these same tests and
that's exactly why we thought lapping
would post a bigger improvement because
that's the one thing we hadn't done to
the 79 t DX II but we didn't laugh the
79 t DX e so we don't get that
comparison we left the 99 t DX e which
means we're still dealing with an
interface between the die and the IHS
which we haven't controlled it was made
at the factory disappointed with these
results overall we are now hypothesizing
that this is potentially a matter of how
the CPU was soldered or made potentially
indicating an issue under the IHS rather
than with the IHS Intel did not
reengineering ID 9 t DX e IHS or
substrate and dies and so the processor
is the same as the 79 80 X e aside from
some
more process maturity and the solder
change it's possible that intel has
thicker solder than is required because
the heat spreader is unchanged for the
most part from when it was used for
thermal paste so solder would need to be
at least as thick as thrown paste or the
throne paste to use on the 79 80 XE to
ensure contact between the die and the
heat spreader there are some minor
changes in here but the amount of
changes for the 99 to DX e whereas the
70 90 d XE are not as significant as
what you would typically see when going
from paste to saw like the changes we
saw with a 9900 K versus something like
this 7700 K so overall it's possible
that the solder thickness is the next
point of consideration and for that it
gets tougher to test paste can be
compressed but solder can't reasonably
be compressed in one of these CPUs it's
possible yes but you'd really have to
cook it the next thing we would have to
do would be deleting the IHS that we
just laughed which would improve things
further but that'd be a lot of work for
a CPU which is already perfect for the
could nitrogen overclocking and is
functional for anything else and it's
$2,000 and D letting these is dangerous
something that Rowand demonstrated
clearly when he attempted to deal it his
own 99 80 XE that's the deal at King
doing that we didn't get the results
that we were expecting to get for the
quartic or deltas everyone was expecting
a much lower court to court Delta
because in the sanding process you can
clearly see that the die has leveled out
and it is level this is not an issue of
an imperfect sand I mean we had arguably
the world's leading overclocker
basically do it for us so it's it's a
more or less a perfect lap there's some
imperfection toward the very outer edge
but that wouldn't cause any of the the
lack of improvement that we saw in court
Accord Delta so realistically what we're
left with is a couple of different
options one of them is that potentially
under the IHS there's another problem
that we can't see and that might be
something to do with the way the solder
has been applied in theory and this is
just
my own speculation in theory Intel
didn't really change a whole lot for the
IHS with the 99 80 X E versus 79 80 DX e
so this was not a the the substrates the
same the CPU is the same so it wasn't
re-engineered for solder maybe that is
part of this but we're not really sure
we can't speak to that the 79 80 XE also
had pretty large Delta's core decor so
it gets a little tricky to figure out
what's expected because the one place we
see this change is if we do direct eye
contact and with direct dye we see those
Delta's on a 79 80 XE drop to about 10
maybe 12 degrees instead of 25 degrees
with liquid metal and an IHS now the 79
80 XE is not the same as our 99 80 XE so
we still have variables there where with
our 70 90 a d XE we didn't laughs the
IHS but we deleted it and put liquid
metal on it so we've we've removed the
one variable that we're questioning on
the 9090 d XE but we have a variable
that we've removed on the ninety nine
eighty XE
which means it's not a perfect
comparison so really if we wanted to go
crazy with this the thing to do would be
to next lap the 79 80 XE IHS put the
liquid metal back on it with no sealant
no no glue to hold them together and
then see if that quartic or Delta really
vanishes because at that point you've
eliminated the variable VHS we could
even if we wanted to risk it we could
deal with our not United txt and swap it
so we would have eliminated that
variable and then we would have
eliminated the consideration of the
interface below the IHS and also the gap
caused by the silicone adhesive so
that'd be what we'd really have to do at
this point to try these things they try
to find the difference or try to
eliminate the difference for the quartic
or deltas another potential theory is
that because a lot of these cold plates
for liquid coolers are made with the
expectation that they're going on a cpu
there are some some exclusions from that
but the expectation that they're going
on the CPU might dictate that a lot of
the cold plates for the liquid coolers
on the market are also going to be
concave or convex to accommodate
whatever
you service they're trying to fit and if
that's the case then that could also
potentially introduce some of the
thermal Delta that we're seeing core to
core but that's not not particularly is
it's not the biggest consideration the
biggest consideration we have is that
solder under the IHS that's what we
think is more likely the issue so we'll
see it's I mean if there's a ton of
interest then we can laugh the subnet ID
XE maybe I can set it out to cane pin
and ask him to do it for us just that
the IHS we have and then test that again
with a lap digest and liquid metal and
no sealant and see what happens if the
deltas go down at that point then we've
found our issue on the ninety nine eight
exe in theory would have been the
interface between the two if it doesn't
go down then there's something else at
play and maybe it's just normal even if
it's not particularly great we our
understanding is that this Delta is on
the higher end of things and in working
with their Bauer previously we learned
that the the core to core Delta of
something like a case Q desktop
enthusiast CPU might be twenty degrees
and then direct IO pretty down closer
like ten or something so yeah it's it's
looking like maybe the interface at this
point either way what we can take away
from this is that a perfect lap on the
IHS cuts it's about two to three degrees
Celsius reduction and speaking with
kingpin and ten this is expected and
usual so if you wanted an extra two to
three degrees that's what you can do to
get it and then the core to core Delta
is something that we need to investigate
more and we don't have a firm conclusion
on what specifically is causing the
large gaps and hours but they are
consistent now and they've been been
seen between multiple runs including
multiple batches of thermal paste and
even different their own taste we're
able to reproduce this issue and even
some of the different coolers too so
that's the big question mark now if
there's a ton of interest we'll keep
looking into it but this is this is
getting to be pretty pretty low down at
this point and not sure how many people
care about this so if you really do care
let us know that way we can take note of
it and continue that's it for this one
though thank you for watching sorry if
the results were disappointing to you
for the
or to court deltas but we've learned a
few important things which is that
there's a lot more to consider than the
IHS and also this whole process just to
really reinforce this is more about
improving the contacts for liquid
nitrogen cooling not really for ambient
so that's why Kane pin does it kingpin
does it because if he uses the cpu as is
where it's got that slight curve in the
IHS then that causes problems with the
thermal paste can crack and then your
liquid nitrogen overclocking gets shut
down temporarily while you either
reapply the paste or try to heat it up
and melt it and and fix the solute that
the issue so that's really why he does
it
should you also lap your IHS well
depends on do you want two to three
degrees improvement if you're doing air
cooling or liquid as the case may be so
that's it for now thank you for watching
