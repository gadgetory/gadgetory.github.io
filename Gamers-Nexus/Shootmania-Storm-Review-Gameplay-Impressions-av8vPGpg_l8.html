nexus dotnet and today we're reviewing
shootmania storm which is nay do and
ubisoft's new venture in classic twitch
shooting gameplay first off i want to
note that I've already uploaded 2
gameplay videos from shootmania so if
you're looking for raw footage and
commentary while I'm actually playing
the game go check those out that are
linked in the description below the full
review is also link there that is a full
written article okay all of this out of
the way we need to talk about what
shootmania actually is the game has kind
of been around for about a year now and
beta and alpha phases but it's finally
shipped and it's been hitting the news
with a couple pretty large tournaments
there's actually an alienware at three
thousand dollar tournament coming up
soon so it's trying to make a splash in
eSports but it's not just a competitive
game it has very good casual elements as
well making for a very fun twitch
arena-style shooter that can really be
played by anyone so the game fuses the
skiing and momentum elements found in
tribes or tribes ascend with the twitch
shooting and arena format in quake and
unreal tournament it's a brilliant mix
of speed and precision so honestly I've
been a big fan of this since I started
playing a couple weeks ago and
shootmania really tries to differentiate
itself from the classic twitch tutors
onra by placing an even heavier emphasis
on player skill and and really removing
a lot of the balance elements that can
happen with for example multiple weapons
so you're saying why are you implying
that there's only one weapon well that's
because there is actually only one
weapon at any given time and really only
one weapon period there are two others
technically but they have very specific
conditions that need to be met to use
them and I'll discuss that in a moment
here's the thing with shootmania it
operates very heavily the entire design
design of the game is built around the
idea of constraining the players so you
only have one weapon you have a
Limited sprint duration you have two
shields it's not a lot of health you
know you can only get hit two times
before you're out basically and then
finally the the map for the free-for-all
mode which is sort of the standard mode
right now unless you're competitive the
map for the free-for-all mode which is
called Royal will compress as the
gameplay goes on so each new map there's
a pole in the middle a player will run
and capture that pole that initiates a
storm and the storm starts on the
outskirts of the level and moves in
slowly until eventually a couple minutes
later you're stuck with just the central
part of that map so it constrains
players forces them inward anyone caught
the storm is immediately eliminated and
then obviously by nature of being forced
closer together the players and the
outer perimeter who are kind of hanging
out and trying to camp will be forced to
abandon their sites and and fight each
other more directly so this does a lot
of things first of all it eliminates
camping almost entirely it keeps the
game very fast-paced because rounds are
pretty strictly limited to only five or
so minutes as soon as a player grabs
that pole that flag it gives them points
so there's incentive to capture it and
it starts the storm which then starts
forcing players inward and and it starts
down a timer so when you're eventually
left with just the middle of the map as
playable space the rest of it is in the
storm just the middle the map the player
account is normally reduced around two
or three at this point and they just
they do can battle each other until
finally a victor is declared if there is
no Victor then the timer will expire and
it will be a draw so so that's really
the gist of the constraints that's the
game design and even with the weapon we
mentioned there's only one weapon even
with that one weapon there's one more
constraint on top of it being your only
active weapon at any time and that is it
has limited shots so for the plasma
cannon which is our standard standard
issue weapon for every character you
only get four shots consecutively in
rapid succession before it needs to
recharge that means each shot needs to
methodically placed
and really carefully timed because if
you miss especially if you rapid-fire
all four shots if you miss you're out of
luck until basically until it recharges
and at that time it's entirely up to you
to move your ability to dodge shots in
coming from other players and on that
note i've been saying in these last two
videos i just talked about in the
written review I've been saying there
are three huge elements to shoot mania
one is your ability to aim
self-explanatory two is your ability to
move around and dodge basically your
dexterity also self-explanatory and
three is speed and momentum and here's
where we start talking about the other
game modes first of all a huge aspect of
the rewarding elements of shoe mania
because it does not reward you with
unlockables and level ups and all of
that shiny stuff it rather rewards you
just by you being better and feeling
good about that and it does sound kind
of stupid to say it but it's true it is
a very rewarding game just to play and
that is awesome so as far as speed and
momentum ago the game really is all
about your other than the shooting the
aiming the dodging your ability to move
quickly and really navigate the map in a
manner that puts you at a constant
advantage and the game has a couple of
small tweaks I suppose in the way
momentum is calculated so there is a
curve and it's not just something you
can't just like hold down spacebar and
instantly be fast there is a trick to it
so there's a lot to learn just in that
aspect alone there's stuff to learn in
the wall jumping the obstacle overcoming
the aspect and by the way there's a full
game mode for that as we've mentioned
and then of course there's a lot to
learn just in aiming and in learning
when to fire your shots so the game is
all about rewarding the player for
learning how to play it not necessarily
being good like Call of Duty does and
that to me is a huge reason that is an
appealing game to all audiences
including more both the more casual side
and the more competitive side who can
play the 3 verse 3 elite mode and that's
just let's talk briefly about that
before we conclude here the game has a
couple modes that has royal the
free-for-all mode we've talked
shown it has an obstacle we've talked
about and shown and that's a player made
boat by the way as joust which is one
versus one duels with other players and
that's pretty cool it's a lot of fun
it's a completely different health count
different way the weapons work it really
switches things up then there's elite
which is basically a 3 vs 3 one person
juggernaut rotation what that means is
each team has there's an attachment of
defender the attacking team has one
player in play so the other two are
sitting on the bench that one player is
going up against the three defenders who
are defending a pole the attacker must
either eliminate all three defenders or
capture the pole once it is available
for capture it's not immediate there's a
little bit of strategy to it and all of
this noted the elite player as the name
implies has a has the hits can rail gun
which is a one hit kill in this mode and
he also has three shields whereas the
defenders will have one shield each and
are stuck on the plasma cannon making
for a very difficult a really tight
competition it comes down to numbers and
the defending team's ability to
communicate where the attacker is that
way they can sort of stick together as
soon as you break apart the attacker is
at a huge advantage like a ninja in the
night or something just going to Sasson
ate them one by one so that's the
competitive mode and really just to wrap
things up here shootmania personally
because this is a review i have to give
you some opinions here i think it's a
fantastic game for twenty bucks all day
long buy it i would i would buy it again
it does have some bugs Justin like
minimizing for example I've had to
restart the game a couple times because
of minimizing nothing huge they're
nothing like actually game breaking our
prohibitive that I've experienced and as
far as other downsides there really
aren't any major ones perhaps the
community is a little bit small but
still as long as you're playing at a
reasonable time at night or afternoon
you're going to find a game just fine
and if you're trying to play in the
middle of the day I'm speaking strictly
to North American service here if you're
trying to play in the middle of the day
well you're going to have a little bit
harder time with the
a royal and competitive modes but you
can drop into player made modes all day
long no problem like obstacle will tide
you over just fine so the game does have
a bit of a following in Europe it's
growing in North America and I
personally hope to see it grow a lot
more i would love to sponsor tournament
in the future but we will talk more
about that separately go check out the
other two videos for gameplay looks just
pure gameplay and you go to the
