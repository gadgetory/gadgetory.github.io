now focusing on the best CPUs for 2017
this includes awards for biggest upset
best overall value budget gaming and
biggest disappointment along with a
couple of others 2017 has given us an
onslaught of CPU releases more than any
year in recent memory and deserves a
send-off to recap the battles in each
category each of the CPUs were
discussing today we'll have a link in
the description below if you want to buy
it and then we'll also have the reviews
with them if you need to catch up on
what we said about them when they first
launched before we get into that this
content is brought to you by the
Thermaltake flow RGB closed-loop liquid
cooler which is a 360 millimeter
radiator plus 3 120 fans that are RGB
illuminated the if then will take it
rain fans at that this is a 4.5 done a
detect pump which is one of the faster
pumps you can learn more at the link in
the description below for the CPU awards
we have one CPU for each major category
from the low end to the high end and
because this is a CPU recap it's
important here to note that as you look
through older coverage will link each
review in the description below for each
of its respective CPUs as you look
through the old coverage keep in mind
that Windows updates driver updates
things like that have impact on the
results so you'll probably want to just
look at our most recent CPU reviews
which would be the coffee like 80 480
700 K ones to get the charts that
include the most up-to-date numbers
possible that stated again each one will
be linked in the description below if
you want to buy it and then we also have
the respective reviews with them so
let's get into it
our first award best overall value
teetered between the r5 1600 and I 580
400 but the r5 1600 ultimately wins the
award back when the r5 CP is launched we
declared the KB Lake I 5s as approaching
obsolescence and awarded the r5 1600 X
with our editors choice award the 8th
gen launched strongly challenged the r5
s in many instances but lacking B&amp;amp;H
motherboards and a paper supply further
fuels the r5 16 hundreds receipt of our
best overall value assignment the rest
of the fuel stems from competitive
performance across the whole suite of
tests including production and
reasonably competitive performance in
gaming the CPU manages to keep
within a couple percentage points of the
i-580 400 most games tested aside from a
select few titles that just don't play
well with risin like destiny - and GTA 5
if those are going to be your years long
obsessions maybe look at other options
but for all-around performance the RFI
of 1600 offers overclocking Headroom
upwards of three point nine to four
point one gigahertz has plenty of
affordable motherboard options and
maintains a strong lead in rendering
workloads of course comparatively few
users are going to leverage the fold
production capabilities of the r5 CPUs
versus those who post multitasking
capabilities but the r5 CPUs give
mobility for exploring beginner
professional workloads which we think is
important for this class of CPU it's the
first CPU of its kind that lets you get
into these types of workloads without a
major upfront investment and that's the
main reason we like the CPU it's an
option that gives excellent beginner
avenues to learn overclocking ones which
yield very direct gains and performance
while also offering beginner to
intermediate options for workstation
tasks gaming performance never chart
tops in our tests but it's also not that
far behind the 8400 and even closer when
accounting for twenty six sixty six
megahertz memory with a hypothetical B
or H motherboard the r5 1600 receives
our highest praise for its whole value
proposition and we find the CPU to be a
genuinely exciting gateway for inbound
enthusiasts ignoring the value side of
things we see Intel's i7 8700 K as the
most well rounded CPU launch in the sub
$500 class for the year the 8700 K and
it's Z 370 platform have wide-reaching
memory support high overclocking
potential even on our potato chips
relatively it also pushes chart-topping
performance in gaming workloads short of
going for a thread Ripper or skylake X
the 8700 K is able to easily keep up
with four gigahertz r7 CPUs and Intel's
usage of the HCC Tim on the 8700 K also
significantly helps with its thermals
this makes the CPU completely reasonable
to operate even without a deal it though
d-lighting does still grant tremendous
gains to aid and power leakage reduction
something we showed in our review
overall the 8700 K is a strong showing
from Intel and was the company's return
to form after years of small increments
in Thals may have the six core 12
threat is just as important for AMD as
it is for Intel as the transition will
help secure development focus on
multi-core optimization for years to
come
87 hired K also improves in key areas
were in to us falling behind like the
improvement to thermal performance by
way of die area increases and HCC Tim
and the CPU also exhibits strong
performance in h.264 live stream
encoding an area where the previous 7700
K was heavily outmatched by the 1700
it's just a matter of whether you can
find one in stock unfortunately and
whether that retailer is selling them
close to the suggested price of roughly
370 dollars maybe you don't care much
about gaming though and need something
that's a bit more money efficient the r7
1700 takes our award for best value for
production as a cpu since its launch we
have held the r7 1,700 high over the
heads of its 1700 x and 1800 x neighbors
and time and again it demonstrates how
easily the r7 1700 is overclocked to
achieve similar if not better
performance to the more expensive
alternatives with pricing that regularly
seen sales as low as $270 but commonly
sitting around 300 the r7 1700 easily
takes this award we see the 1700 as a
good fit for small business or hobbyist
and freelance workstation users people
who might do things like 3d animation or
modeling for instance or other render
centric tasks that can benefit from core
account the r7 1700 stands alone and its
value offering for such users and its
AMD's best launch in the r7 family its
power efficient as overclocking Headroom
and handles multi-threaded render
workloads readily and it's also
affordable the next award is for the
best budget gaming CPU we're looking at
ultra budget here I send cheapest
possible gaming build that still remains
reasonably scalable and this goes to the
Intel Pentium G 45 60 the G 45 60 has
lived a troubled life thus far
like the g3 2 5 8 before it the 45 60
saw instant success in low budget
markets and quickly sold out the CPU
also shot up in price has gone through
supply shortages and up until recently
has been difficult to get a hold of
finally though the 45 60 is readily
available and it's still slightly higher
than desired at a price of 70 to 80
dollars
but one of the best options for a dirt
cheap desktop gaming PC the senior
performs reasonably in most games we've
tested we even performed AG 45 60 GPU
bottleneck and test earlier this year
finding that the CPU didn't
significantly choke on GPUs until
entering into the GTX 970 territory the
G 45 60 is well suited for our x5 70s
and 4 seventies gtx 750ti s and even GTX
10 sixties but now for purposes of
balancing system cost we'd recommend
staying in the sub $200 EP price range
that said you've got room to go a little
beyond that not much but it's there and
for the most part the CB does well in
games there are as a couple that it
struggles with just make sure you check
our original benchmarks to figure out if
those apply to you for win cost is the
heaviest restriction and $120 I three
CDs aren't an option the G 45 60 remains
competitive our next award goes to the
79 60 X for being the most fun to
overclock this year required a lot of
prep work d letting and some conductor
not to set the stage with big radiators
and high end fans doing the rest
this award is shared equally I suppose
by the a C's X 299 rampage board for its
limitless nya overwhelming overclocking
options and sub options and a direct fan
on the vrm d lid later and we were able
to push the 79 60 X into the range of
4.7 gigahertz with just a 360 millimeter
radiator we were nearly stable at 4.8 to
but some further tuning may have
achieved it pushing 4.7 on a 16 core CPU
and what is an actual potential user
scenario is impressive to say the least
it's a 500 watt power consumption doing
so of course so it's impractical for
long-term use but it's a fun day of
testing and it reinvigorates the
enthusiasts spirit of it if you're
looking for overclocking we do like the
79 60 X for that task and it is a good
CPU as well just a bit expensive when
you look at our next category and that
one is the biggest upset of 2017 this
one goes to the thread Ripper CPU before
thread Ripper we thought this would go
to the our 5s but the thread Ripper and
X to 99 shipments completely changed the
h EDT landscape thread rivers launch up
set the high end mark
in a way that has had wide-reaching
impact at its price the one thousand
dollar threader for 1950 ex has some of
the best performance and heavily
multi-threaded workloads and has
challenged most heavily by significantly
more expensive Intel CPUs additional
PCIe lanes become highly valuable in use
cases that are left otherwise unserved
at this price point and thread Ripper
manages to serve both traditional HD DT
and fringe h EDT users exceptionally
well for this category we do favor the
1950 X oh and before someone begins type
in a gigantic tirade please note that
the words biggest upset aren't a bad
thing we're saying that it upset the
incumbent in the market not that it's
upsetting that goes to the next category
and that's biggest disappointment across
all the products launched this year and
there were many contenders for biggest
disappointment the absolute hands-down
winner of this dunce cap is the KB Lake
X cpu line we were clear in our dislike
of this lineup when it launched some of
you took issue with our quote
disrespectful tossing of the 77 40 X CPU
but that's a minor grievance when
compared to how Intel tossed KB Lake X
users aside instantly with coffee lake
mere months after its a nearly pointless
launch the languishing that KB Lake X
CPU argument became more belaboured in
the face of copy Lake the KB Lake X
launch is the single biggest CBD
disappointment since bulldozer it's not
horribly performing but it also has no
wide reaching at mainstream defense to
its existence this is not a matter of
performance it's a matter of why it
exists the product line it was a
bullshit segmentation attempt from the
start and has remained such through the
rest of the year the final award is for
worst trend we're using this one to call
out commenters AMD and Intel have both
put out some good CPUs this year and
when we look at head-to-head matchups at
the same price there tend to be
victories on both sides of the fence the
worst trend award goes to everyone who
felt it necessary to forge new truths
also known as talking out of your ass or
lying and this is for the people who
felt it necessary to defend their
preferred CPU in every single use case
whether or not the CPU made sense in
that use case news flash no one CPU will
be the best
everything hand when something like
risin or coffee-like are as good as they
are at the respective strengths there is
no need to make things up
no objectively speaking NR seven 1700 is
not quote smoother in gaming than a
modern i7 and no an 8700 K does not
invalidate these 1700 as a world-class
production CPU it's possible for both of
these CPUs to coexist and dominate
different markets fortunately they're
both fairly versatile so they have some
crossover between them where you can
even do things like gaming on one or
production on the other so this is an
instance where we don't need to go
around posting comments that straight
make things up because seriously the
CPUs are good enough on their own they
don't need your help just stick to the
actual reality of them so separately
with the advent of the six core Intel
CPUs and the Rison push further on eight
cores six cores and so on we'd like to
remind everyone that Chrome and discord
don't count as multitasking that's not
really what people mean when they talk
about multitasking oh and before anyone
says but my cores we're not saying it's
a bad thing for the industry to move in
this direction
we're just saying seek to understand
what the change actually does for you
rather than making things up so that's
all for this one we've got some good
CPUs on the list and we've got some
great comments on the list thank you for
a year of those and we hope you
appreciated a year of CPU reviews I
think we're done with the reviews of
CPUs for the end of the year though
hopefully but there will be more to come
sometime around or after CES so stay
tuned for all that you can subscribe for
