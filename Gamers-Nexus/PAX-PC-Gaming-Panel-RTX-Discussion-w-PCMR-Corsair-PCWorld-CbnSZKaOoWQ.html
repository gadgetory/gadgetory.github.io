topics in the past week or so
the 2080 what are your guys fuss at at
the same time you know people have been
angry at me because they feel like I'm
you know I'm the shill for in video but
I think people 1 never pre-order because
why would you but wait for the
benchmarks at the same time would I run
out and go buy a 1080 TI or a 1080 right
now I want to wait and see what what's
gonna be on the other side and I do
respect that what they're trying to do
with this card may not go over well but
they are at least trying to go for
something else besides just more frame
rates at a higher resolution which most
people don't really need me at this
point so I respect that and I think
people need to just pump the pump on the
heat brakes a little bit so now I feel
like whatever reason there exists to
during the keynote we we haven't seen
any kind of performance benchmarks or
different numbers
whatever reason it is it's not a
positive reason so we have to wait
unless we just buy it once all your life
to have ray-tracing man yeah
for me it's I'm not as smart as most of
my co-workers so for me it's just the
itch I'm just like I don't I don't know
why I just when I see something new and
shiny I just want it and I think that's
kind of a problem but at the same time
to each their own you know do you guys
think that's a thing among the the PC
community is like when there's a new
hardware announce everybody is like oh I
need to get it it's a humanity yes you
everyone wants the newest biggest and on
the twenty eighty though I think a lot
of the ray-tracing stuff it is really
cool there is validity to wanting to go
that direction definitely anybody is
doing a good job of trying to go that
direction they're also doing a good job
of trying to go that direction when
there's not a process shrink and they
can't get them improvement in
performance elsewhere so like there is a
marketing play but hopefully there's
some action
we'll gain from it for the industry
because like chicken or the egg problem
no one can do rate racing if they don't
have hardware to do rage racing on the
right valper side but also on the
consumer side games don't really have it
yet other than the few they listed or
any of the other features they had so
it's a problem there but the end of the
day and video can't get more gains
easily until we get down to seven
nanometer cuz they're on fourteen or
sixteen now depend on which card so
that's a limitation and price is a
limitation because g2g are six is twenty
percent more than gddr5 so definitely
there's a lot of marketing going into
the RT x announcement which is not
abnormal for any product announcement
but I mean keep it in mind I guess
because it's not it's if you buy it it's
not like the games that you play today
will look amazing and way better than
they ever have unless you consummately
old graphics card because they frankly
just they don't have the features that
it supports yet right ultimately the
problem is we need we need competition
for graphics cards right
ambi needs to get its button into action
because it's been awesome on CPU side
with rise in a thread Ripper and core I
9 and core i7 we're in a I mean you
could get cores now that you could never
get five years ago for the price you're
paying for if we see that in GPUs
everybody will be happy nobody will
compete complaining about twenty eighty
at whatever price everybody will just be
happy the competition is a huge concern
too because as nvidia takes more control
of the market they're getting into a
position where they have more control
over partners and media and everyone
else in the chain so like i mean ideally
they just keep making good video cards
and leave it at that but definitely
there is a president that without
competition I look at Intel for like ten
years before they had rise in the face
it kind of stagnates so yeah that's
that's actually a big concern of mine is
what happens if and these stops making
video cards that can compete yeah I have
a yeah I would imagine that what
happened but yeah that is what was a
concern I think they're gonna continue
to push in you know twenty eighty could
be amazing it could be a complete
disaster because they could take a right
turn
named he makes a left turn and everybody
wants to go left turn with AMD this time
so we don't know so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
