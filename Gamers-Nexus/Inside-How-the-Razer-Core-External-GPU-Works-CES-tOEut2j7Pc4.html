donna and today we're talking about the
razor blade stealth core that would be
the external GPU enclosure accompanying
the razor blade of stealth that we
looked at previously on the channel if
you want to see more about that hit the
channel linked down below but before we
get to that all this content is brought
to you by our powers revolt to a small
form-factor gaming PC the core box is
actually pretty interesting compared to
the other external GPU enclosures and
that is primarily because it is a
non-proprietary unit so this could
actually use for other devices you don't
have to use the razor blade stealth
laptop with it and that's different from
say alienware is you know that came out
last year where you had to use the
alienware special connector at a
proprietary connector in this case it
just uses USB type-c to connect the core
to the blade stealth and that's a pretty
big deal and that you could use type c
with other things not just the laptop
that raisers making and the other non
proprietary connector is of course
thunderbolt version 3 which has a 40
gigabit per second throughput and that
is what enables us to do the external
GPU at speeds that are somewhat
reasonable the speed translation there
you're stopping down a pcie x 16 gem 3
slot to about pcie x 4 so you lose a bit
of the laning because of the 40 gigabits
per second cap on thunderbolt 3 but that
translates to about a six percent FPS
hit in gaming so it's not a huge
real-world performance hit on the rear
side of the enclosure there's a Gigabit
Ethernet port which will obviously take
up about a gigabit of your bandwidth
there's also for USB 3.0 ports which
operate at somewhere around five
gigabits per second 4.8 and with four of
those had about five you're running 20
gigabits per second with ethernet at one
so saturated and all that Foley which is
pretty unlikely you'd be running your
GPU at a fairly hamstrung speed it would
be suboptimal but because the USB 3.0
ports will almost never be operating at
fully saturated speeds unless you're
driving a bunch of extra
drives off of it it's really not that
much of a concern because the pcie x 16
at the 40 gigabits per second USB type-c
or Thunderbolt 3 protocol will be plenty
for most gaming the razor cores also not
they worked with Microsoft with Intel
with Andy with NVIDIA on the driver
support and the main thing here is that
you can disconnect the razor core sort
of almost hot-swappable style you can
just disconnect it through the interface
as you would do with an external hard
drive and then reconnect it and just
kind of go as needed so the reason that
was a challenge is because of Optimus
with laptops that do the internal I the
igp or the internal GPU on the CPU and
the dedicated GPU and run them together
with the razor core the drivers are
loaded as soon as the GPU is connected
and once it's disconnected they're
unloaded so that's all done on the fly
and that was the most difficult part of
developing this unit with all the
software support to learn more about the
razor blade stealth and core check the
previous video we did on the channel
where we looked at it at the AMD suite
at CES 2016 thanks for watching we'll
see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
