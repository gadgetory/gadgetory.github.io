Nexus dotnet and today we're going to
round up four new ish liquid coolers
closed-loop liquid coolers excuse me
or CLC's and those four coolers for
today will be Corsairs 280 millimeter
hydro series h 110 CLC and 140
millimeter H 90 CLC against NZXT s 280
millimeter X 60 and 140 millimeter X 40
models and all four of these units are
supplied by ace tech who is a liquid
cooler engineer and supplier and they
engineer the radiator the pump and the
tubing so really for this reason all for
use identical mounting mechanisms and
perform relatively similarly in terms of
thermals although you will see that
there is quite a large difference and
one aspect and a little bit let's first
talk about the hard specs for each
cooler and then jump into objective
thermal performance data and my opinions
so starting with the smaller units
here's what we're looking at the the
small units are in this in this case the
H 90 and kraken x 40 by coarser and NZXT
respectively the corsair hydra series h
90 and the x 40 are both 140 millimeter
radiator units so they are larger than
the until now standard size 120
millimeter radiators and both ship with
one fan but can be equipped with two
which i tested and we'll talk about that
in a moment and both of them use the
same copper cold plate design by a stack
same radiator by a stack all of that
same tubing
although the NZXT units do have longer
tubing in this case i don't have it in
front of me right now i think it's 16
inches which is slightly longer than the
corsair units and as for the larger
coolers we're looking at coursers h 110
and NZXT scratchin x 60 both of which
are 280 millimeter radiators so
radiators wow that was a whole jumble of
letters and that's pretty huge I don't
need to tell most of you that so very
few cases support these right now a
Corsair and NZXT of course to make most
of them that support this sized radiator
and they do utilize a dual fan cooling
design to 140 millimeter fans and can be
mounted with two additional fans for a
total of
or in a push-pull configuration and all
four coolers are compatible with all
modern socket types including Intel's
LGA 1155 1156 1366 and 2011 sockets the
AMD socket compatibility includes a.m. 2
a.m. 2 + + 3 + a.m. three expose and FM
1 so all four coolers are compatible
with pretty much every CPU socket you
can think of I'm not sure what Intel's
LGA 1150 or Haswell socket is in terms
of the mounting I don't know if you'll
need to adapt it or not but regardless
all 4 coolers also offer a two-year
limited parts and labor warranty in my
experience both coarser and NZXT do have
pretty good warranty policies the the
NZXT coolers differentiate themselves a
bit from the Corsair units and I already
mentioned tube sizes 1 or lengths rather
but NZXT kraken coolers also use a
custom software solution to offer the
user regulation over fan speed via
voltage modulation and custom LED
coloring and they even give user
visibility to the temperature of the
liquid and pump RPM only a Corsairs the
iSeries coolers offer that functionality
and neither of these are ICS that is the
suffix so the h 90 and h 110 are both
bereft of such features and as I discuss
in the full article linked below is tech
supplied coolers are tough to
differentiate from each other
given their similar roots but software
generally does help split them apart a
bit more let's talk cooling our testing
methodology for these is a little bit
more detailed than normally so it's in
the full post below check that out if
you're curious but in short we use a 4.4
gigahertz overclocked 35 70 K at 1.3
volts ish under both idle and load
conditions the load is synthetically
generated by prime95 s4 threaded large
fft algorithm which effectively forces
the CPU to perform complex computations
at 100% load this is a four threaded CPU
so there's that we allow the CPU to idle
prior to the bench and collect thermal
data under idle and then initiate a
fifteen minute
via prime95 SL fft test and I tested
NZXT the their coolers with the
pre-configured silent extreme and a
custom max profile that I configured in
the software and of course Corsairs are
a bit simpler they just you just plug it
in and go and as i rapidly found out you
shouldn't take the maximum custom
configuration that i created too
seriously it's unbelievably loud and is
entirely intolerable for any normal user
so imagine playing games while the
loudest most monstrous sounding vacuum
cleaner you've ever known sits beside
you that's about how max sounds for
purely for performance reasons I left it
in the bench so if you're curious it's
there don't take it too seriously the
coarser larger unit hovers at around
thirty to thirty seven decibels under
normal usage and NZXT Zechs sixty silent
setting puts it slightly below that
threshold but the extreme is slightly
louder so it kind of flanks Corsair
there if you're planning to add
additional fans to these units you can
calculate the increased noise level
using a standard standard logarithmic
function of the total fan count the
output is the decimal decibel increase
and as for the extra fans when I tested
it there was about a two to five percent
difference depending on the cooler in
terms of cooling in terms of thermal
dissipation so personally not worth it
to me
don't even worry about it just adds
extra noise it's more expensive it's
bigger and the advantage is minimal so
so that was my my testing there on those
I didn't even include it in these charts
all units were tested in the top mounted
position and we ran into interesting
results when playing around with rear
mounted 140 millimeter radiators but you
can read more about that in the article
Corsair hydro h 110 is the hands-down
winner out of the pack at roughly 3 C
cooler than NZXT Zechs 60 on a tolerable
Xtreme profile and with a significantly
lower idle measurement if you are going
for pure performance the H 110 appears
your best bet the x60 under our maximum
configuration profile is basically
identical to the h1 10 when it's at
normal settings it's within margin of
error it's like 0.1 C so we do have a 5%
margin of error and the idle
temperatures are strangely high on all
NZXT units again I'd say discard the max
settings due to noise levels your mate
mainly looking at extreme and silent
profiles as I mentioned in the article
if you're after a low noise threshold
and don't care much for an extra 3
Celsius of dissipation potential well
the X 60 is an easy choice
the silent profile is just too good to
ignore and it does give you a bit more
control over what's going on the option
to create a bursty custom fan speed
config is highly appealing to noise
sensitive users and again if you're
looking for a pure performance get the
h1 10 ultimate control over noise get
the X 60 pretty simple as for the
smaller units the H 90 is easily the
best overall value as you'll see on a
chart in a moment and it's a couple
degrees cooler than the X 40 on the
extreme configuration and significantly
cooler on air at idle it is also
generally more cost friendly and if you
don't care for the LED NZXT branding or
software control the H 90 is the best
choice between these two units it's
quiet enough that personally I'd even
disregard the silent setting on the X 40
in favor of the H 90 that's just me your
preferences could well be different so
do do a bit more research on that if if
noise is something that bothers you
if you are trying to use this in some
sort of living room environment go with
the NZXT coolers just because you'll
probably want that control ultimately
it'll come to price and aesthetics pick
the logo you want decide if you want the
led decide how important softer control
is and grab your unit that's what these
manufacturers are doing anyway it's all
it's just build a bear put a sticker on
it so you can view the full benchmark
results in the link below where you'll
also see how our control pasted air
coolers match up against the liquid
coolers and with that that's all for
this roundup I will see you all next
