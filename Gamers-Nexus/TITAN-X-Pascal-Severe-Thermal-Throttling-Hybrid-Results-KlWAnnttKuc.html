complete so that's what this is here now
with a liquid cooler attached to it and
the blower fan and the results are
actually pretty interesting this shows
the biggest change out of all the hybrid
cards we've built so far including the
ten eighty four eighty and ten sixty
this one actually the results very
directly impact performance clock rates
and things like that and the conclusion
is basically that the cooler on here is
not adequate for for what we were doing
and we'll talk about that in the moment
this coverage is brought to you by I by
power and the new elements in gaming pc
which has the arc LED fans a full
tempered glass side window and under
glow if you want to have neons like in
Need for Speed Underground 2 so the
hybrid card pretty interesting stuff we
catalogued chronolog the last build
process in the last couple videos you
can see how we tore it down built it up
and today we're looking at the results
the methodology is in the article linked
in the description below you can also
find more depth there if you're curious
and a quick shout out to Sam thank you
for loaning us this card because Nvidia
did not sample this one to us though
they sampled the rest of the cards
recently during our endurance test we
plotted the Titan X P with its stock
cooler as throttling at 84 Celsius every
hit 284 C caused an immediate drop in
clock rate and the clock rate got stuck
around 15 44 megahertz but sometimes
would spike to 1670 or drop as long as
the 1400 the spec calls for a fifteen
thirty one megahertz boost on paper and
the chart makes it pretty clear that our
clock rate is spiking hard and as a
result of the thermal it's not the power
limit in this instance but it's still
within spec we occasionally spiked to 85
or 86 Celsius but the card mostly
throttles hard to keep itself at 83
Celsius here's a look at some raw data
to see what's going on you can see that
the clock has a range around 100
megahertz
top to bottom which doubly presents
itself and 0.1% low values if you happen
to hit a spike during workloads putting
that into perspective the original chart
plots us at hovering around the 15 100
megahertz to 1580 megahertz range kind
of averaged with an 84 C temperature
with our hybrid mod we brought the Titan
X Pascal up to nearly 18 100 megahertz
that's the absolutely no overclock at
all on average we're moving
15:31 megahertz or thereabouts on the
stock cooler to an average of about 1784
megahertz with the liquid cooler we've
improved the clock rate of the stock
card by more than 200 megahertz just by
fixing its air cooler and this next
parts even better the only reason we're
still seeing that spiky frequency plot
is because the card is now choking on
power rather than thermals it's almost
funny in that way we've resolved the
thermal constraint and are now hitting
power constraints which can be somewhat
resolved and tested simply by increasing
the power limit of the card you don't
even have to overclock it so that would
resolve this and flatten the clock rate
even a little bit more here's an updated
look at the peak average temperatures
we're down to a delta T versus ambient
value of nineteen point eight five
Celsius from fifty nine point four
Celsius or a reduction of forty c for
the load temperature idle temperatures
are a little lower than a ten eighty and
that's for a few reasons it actually
does make sense despite maybe being
confusing at first because this is a
higher TDP chip the main one is that the
die size is 471 millimeters squared on
the GP 102 Titan the X whereas GP 104 is
314 that millimeters squared this extra
surface area helps dissipate heat and
that's mostly noticeable when it's idle
because not doing anything obviously but
the improved air cooler for the air
tests and our improved implementation of
liquid for the hybrid tests also
contributes to the lower idle
temperature across the board than the
1080 and part of that is keeping the
base plate this time which helps drive
down thermals across the card we were
able to overclock higher end with a
greater sustained average clock rate
than before thanks to the improved
thermal solution still the Titan XP
chokes hard on power availability and is
demonstrated by the fact that increasing
the memory clock beyond 450 megahertz
will actually decrease fps and that's
because power is being eaten away from
the core we actually gained more fps by
dropping the memory overclocked from its
actually stable 600 megahertz offset
value to a four 50 megahertz value that
we settled with for the original
non-modified card that seems to be the
point beyond which Domitian returns come
into play so once you've passed that 450
mark on this particular card there are
diminishing returns in so far as the
framerate will actually decrease and
that's again because core frequency goes
down regardless our over
stepping is on the screen now we landed
at 2012 megahertz peak that's the very
highest or about 1974 megahertz
arresting clock with the hybrid card the
stock card by comparison with a loud and
high rpm fan was getting stuck at about
175 megahertz core offset for a total of
1987 megahertz Peak or 1911 megahertz
average we've managed to decrease
thermals and noise and increase the
overclock by about 63 megahertz it's not
a huge OC but there's more to it than
just numbers we've also got a look at
stability and now that the thermals are
not throttling on the card it's down to
just the power limit as for FPS
differences we see a change of less than
3% in shadow of mordor at 1080p and 4k
moving from 91 FPS average to 93 FPS
average but the 0.1% low values have
been improved from 62 to 71 FPS as a
result of the more stable clock rate
that's not super noticeable to the gamer
at this level of performance anyway but
it is cool to see our methodology
picking up the clock rate instability of
actually showing where it shines to
measure those low values well looking at
GTA 5 what we see a performance swing of
nearly 4% and the average is at 4k 1080p
doesn't really show any real change but
the 0.1% lows are marginally improved
again imperceptibly but measurably
Mirror's Edge catalyst posts the biggest
swings with a change of about 5% at
1440p and about 6% at 4k high so not
massive but overall the performance of
the card has certainly increased and
part of that is just a better overclock
and most of it is the better clock rate
stability so that is the Titan XP hybrid
project really cool results on this one
just to kind of see how it performs and
Vidya I think should have used a better
cooler weather that's liquid maybe by
kind of the stock configuration would
would make sense for a $1200 video card
if they're trying to make it so that
it's more compatible with a wider range
of cases as FF and all that then just a
better air cooler would make sense
because this is very obviously
throttling even in its stock
configuration so pre OC we're changing
the clock rate by something like 100 to
200 megahertz just by changing the
cooler that's because this thing when
it's under Auto control for the fan is
hitting 80 485 Celsius now if you were
to configure the fan manually to
something like a hundred percent speed
and under the
extra noise then you would resolve some
of these thermal issues with the stock
card but 100 percent noise on one of
these blower fans does get a bit loud
and really when you can just throw
better cooling on it it doesn't make a
lot of sense to do again especially
because it's an expensive card so why
why not do a default push fan side up or
something like that I know it kind of
breaks the Nvidia aesthetic this is only
sold on on videos website right now to
my understanding I don't think there'll
be partner cards there might be a few
from EVGA like with the Titan X Maxwell
but that would be about the most I would
expect so exclusivity does ruin the
cooling potential of this a bit because
there's not gonna be as many a B partner
models if any at all with the push fans
with liquid coolers things like that to
resolve the thermal throttling points of
84 85 Celsius but this fixed it so and
in the very least there's a cool proof
of concept this card will now be going
back to Sam who loaned it to us for
review he's one of our viewers not in
video they didn't sample it so thank you
Sam for that hopefully if we if we do
any modifications before sent in the
back we'll do a quick Twitter post or
something to follow us at gamers next us
on Twitter subscribe check us out on
patreon the post roll video or links in
the description below if you want to
help us out directly on the next
projects and thanks for watching I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
