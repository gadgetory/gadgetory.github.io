access net and I'm joined again by Alva
come from the total war Warhammer team
at Creative Assembly we previously
talked about some of the new Warhammer
features on the game inside now we be
talking about so the optimization stuff
the technology and before we get to that
this coverage up from PAX East 2016 is
brought to you by cyber power to make
the fan book that we recently
overclocked past four gigahertz so wow
what what can we talk about immediately
with regard to the engine what's the
most interesting thing to talk about
with Total War well I think we could
probably start with yeah the engine
optimizations that we've done
essentially graphics programming team
has taken quite a lot of time in the
schedule this time around months in fact
to work simply on optimizations and you
know implement things in a more
efficient way so one of the things we've
done there is we've got a much better
sense of load balancing across the
different CPU cores in Warhammer than
we've ever had before so for example we
used to have the game logic and the
renderer running on the single thread
which you know kind of maxes out one
core maxes out one thread leaving the
other threads not really doing an awful
lot and we've decoupled those so
information is passed and one thread to
the other from the game not into the
renderer so now you're seeing a much
more evenly balanced load across the
across the different CPU cores so and
that's really helping just with general
frame rates and the model update which
dictates you know how smoothly
everything runs after and frame rate so
so with the game logic thread and the
renderer thread what are some things
that each of those does what's the logic
thread responsible for so the logic
thread is responsible for welfare
essentially for the game running for
everything you see on screen so in a
battle it's it's running the battle
model which is literally executing
everything you're seeing so you know you
give an order to something it's moving
away you're seeing all the animations
different units and they're clashing
those calculations are done the a is the
a is responding that's all that's all
bound up in the game logic so in the
battle model so and then it pass the
information to renderer which then draws
what you see on screen so so yeah having
those separated is a big win basically
frame frame rate wise on the GPU side we
were targeting for it sounds like you've
some other particle effects to the GPU
yeah we've offloaded our particle
simulations model to the GPU that again
that used to be able to CPU so that's
yet more load off the CPU making it less
CPU bound that we've ever been so we've
also optimized our targeted task system
as well which is you know everything
that's being executed by the CPU to
further balanced load across across the
different calls so once again it's more
of a win less CPU bound GPUs freed up to
do its job better so what about some of
the anti-aliasing techniques so you
doing anything special there yeah we've
actually we've done a ton of
optimization with MSA so R 2 R 2
anti-aliasing solutions we've got in the
game MLA and MSA a so you know MLA a
being a bit of a post-process hat almost
so you know it improves it improves the
look and feel and doesn't hit the frame
rate too badly MSA is much more much
more framerate intensive so what we've
done there we've made our solution a bit
more kind of selective and a bit more
intelligent about what actually aunty
aliases so looks at the whole scene it
looks for the edges rather than rather
than anti-aliasing every line every line
and every edge is just looking for the
edges which are going to be visible to
the player so and it's selectively
anti-alias as those all of which adds up
to less you know less hit on the
framerate this will be something of
course it's still you know it's still a
fairly intensive operation but much less
than before and we've got MSA a two four
and eight times running
yeah so it's not not as abusive because
it's just only anti-aliasing the things
that actually can be visibly seen
exactly yeah so if you think of ever you
know a soldier standing side on and the
edges are there that's where you're
gonna see the jaggies so that's what
it's working on rather than absolutely
everything so sure and other future
topics of course we'll eventually be
able to talk about DirectX 12 you're
working with AMD on that right yeah work
very closely with work we have got AMD
engineers coming into our offices and
helping and helping the graphics team
out with that so yeah we'll be rolling
that out we're happy performance it's
great and it's nice and stable so what's
this based on the I guess one one final
note here just on the game itself so
reminder what's the launch day in any
any major items you wanna remind people
of with total war Warhammer
yeah so we're launching on May 24th
actually so ya know it's any month away
now wow it's kind of scary but yeah yeah
I would say get on our social media and
look at look look at some of the videos
we're putting out of gameplay at the
moment and yeah it's just not like any
other tie ball game ever made basically
very cool so to see more about the
fusion of a Warhammer in total war links
in the description below for more
information thank you as always for the
information right good to see and we'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
