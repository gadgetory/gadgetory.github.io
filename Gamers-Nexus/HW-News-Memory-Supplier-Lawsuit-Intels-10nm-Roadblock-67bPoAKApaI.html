this week's pretty big so memory
suppliers are now facing a class action
lawsuit never saw that one coming in
tiles got a 10 nanometer delay which is
hugely problematic and we also have
Intel documents showing an X 399 and
Cannon Lake support on Z 390 so lots of
talk about this week before that this
video is brought to you by I fix it's
brand new man 2 driver kit the iFixit
Manta kit is a universal repair tool kit
that includes 112 steel bits redesigned
from the ground up with longer necks for
four millimeter bits allowing more
precision when working on components the
$60 iFixit Manta kit has everything from
pentalobe drivers to why drivers and
standard bits
learn more at the link in the
description below quick Cheon merge
update before getting into the memory
supplier class action we have these new
glass crystals that have the GN teardown
logo in 3d as 3d laser engrave they're
available on store gamers Nexus thought
net we have a small one here we call it
I guess medium is what we're calling it
we have a keychain and then we have a
large glass crystal with a teardown logo
that is suitable for hand-to-hand combat
and you can buy it on the store but also
we are planning to use these as awards
for manufacturers at events when they do
something actually worthy of accolade
which is rarely will probably give one
out of here but either way in all
seriousness we're looking forward to
using them as awards we a lot of the
partners do great things at shows and we
want to make sure that we give them
attention they have something to show
for it and say look what we got from the
most critical outlet on YouTube those
guys are assholes but they gave us an
award so that'll be fun but also you can
buy it on store I can't resist on it so
first real news item memory supplier
class actions we've previously reported
on Chinese government bodies
investigating memory suppliers for what
might be price-fixing at the time is
what they were looking into we reported
in our latest ask GN one of the two
episodes that memory suppliers claims to
be making more money than ever and also
more money than God in one direct quote
from a source I spoke with so they're
doing pretty well right now for money
and just to be really clear when we say
memory suppliers
referring to SK Hynix micron and Samsung
Prime net primarily there are three of
them who make the memory that we all
interface with daily it does not mean
Coursera Kingston g.skill guile any of
the other manufacturers who buy the
memory from the suppliers and stick it
on to a PCB with a heatsink basically so
this is strictly talking about the
suppliers there are three of them who
control effectively 100% of the market
so this class action has come about
because of the DRAM pricing right now a
quick few notes here DRAM sales the
server and enterprise groups are just
fine they're doing about sixty percent
margins from some of the suppliers which
should give you an idea of why we don't
matter in the enthusiasts space if
you're spending maybe a hundred bucks
for a kid of memory and you're hoping to
spend less than that then why would you
sell to enthusiasts if you can sell to a
server user hundreds of gigabytes if not
terabytes for sixty percent margins kind
of puts into perspective just how small
our side of the industry is and also the
same wafers have to be used for GPU
memory for phone memory for flash in
some cases where the suppliers create
flash at some of the fabs and also for
all the other different types of DRAM
out there and cache memory and all
that's the first small devices to so
you're sharing a lot of space we know
for facts through direct sources that
some memory suppliers make as much as
$8,000 profit per wafer with the super
fabs the 15 billion dollar super
fabrication facilities as they're called
putting out hundreds of thousands or
over a hundred thousand in the low-end
cases wafers per month at eight thousand
dollars profit per wafer they're doing
pretty well so HBS of law is now filing
a class-action lawsuit against micron
Samsung and SK Hynix and HBS law is
alleging conspiracy to fix prices for
memory and also know that this lawsuit
it's currently in complaint form so
there's no proof right now nothing has
proven at this time there's no proof
that there is price fixing or collusion
or any other foul play there's just a
lot of allegations coming from this
particular loss law firm which is a
filed class-action lawsuit currently a
come
Planes and that means that they're
basically representing people who have
purchased memory from these three
defendants so memory suppliers have been
found guilty of collusion for
price-fixing in the past but the trouble
is that in the past as with other cases
of wrongdoing in the industry typically
the company committing the wrongdoing
profits more than the fine and they end
up in a market position of dominance
where the fines are negligible anyway
look at Intel and what they did when
they worked with Dell in very special
ways on the CPU side of things so as a
reminder as of this instant there's
nothing proven and there's no active
investigation or discovery it's a
complaint filed by a law firm after a
complaint is filed just so you know the
defendants have 21 days to respond or
motion to dismiss we should know the
response within a month or so and then
we'll see where it goes from there the
plaintiffs for the case alleged that
samsung micron and hynek's quote
defendants combined and contracted to
fix raise maintain or stabilize the
prices at which DRAM was sold in the
United States from at least June 1st
2016 to February 1st 2018 further
stating that quote defendants conspiracy
artificially inflated prices for DRAM
throughout the supply chain that were
ultimately passed through the plaintiffs
and the class causing them to pay more
for DRAM products and they would
otherwise would have absent defendants
conspiracy the complaint also states
quote beginning no later than early 2016
through statements to investors and the
industry micron called on Samsung and SK
Hynix the two other DRAM manufacturers
to engage in supply discipline for
example on March 30th 2016 micron was
specifically asked whether it would
engage in supply cuts and micron CEO
Mark Durkin responded that micron would
be foolish to be the first ones to take
capacity off microns at CFO further
confirmed that micron it would not
unilaterally cut production quote it's a
really ill-advised move to be
unilaterally cutting production but at
the same time micron reassured
competitors that quote our focus is not
on market share micron told its
competitors that it would cease trying
to take
market share from Samson and Hynek so
these are all quotes from the document
which is in some cases quoting
executives at micron this is more or
less saying that micron in its
statements noted publicly that it would
be moving its focus to profit or profit
per wafer rather than to market share
and expansion of market share taking
over more of the market when you only
have three suppliers and you're focusing
on making as much money as you can and
really squeezing those wafers where all
the money they have it's starting to
look a bit strange but that's where the
allegations come in so this part is
equally interesting and what I wanted to
read for you on February first this is a
quote 2018 it was reported that Samsung
and the NDRC that's the Chinese
governing body that we mentioned earlier
the governing body that began
investigating for price fixing in
December last year which we reported on
they're saying that the NDRC and Samsung
entered into a Memorandum of
Understanding where Samsung agreed to
increase manufacturing capacity the MDRC
investigation and agreement with Samsung
caused defendants conduct that change as
they increased capacity and the class
period came to an end after February 1st
2018 DRM prices fell as a result of this
change in behavior so we'll have to wait
and see what happens here as noted
there's no hard evidence yet there's a
lot of consequential evidence and things
that look really fishy and strange given
the timing of everything I will provide
some level of opinion here and say that
it does not seem completely out of sorts
that there would be some kind of foul
play or very shady but legal play going
on within the DRM and memory supplier
industry right now they're making tons
of money their stock prices are insane
if we can pop a stock chart on the
screen if we haven't already for micron
or hynek's those would be the ones to
look at can't really look at Samsung's
because they make so much stuff that it
just it becomes kind of invisible what's
causing what but micron in hynek's our
memory suppliers first and foremost you
look at their stock charts you look at
the price of memory they go up in unison
so basically the the less product they
make the more money they make
so if there is intentional constriction
of supply and there are three
manufacturers in the world that's
potentially a problem if they're all
doing it but we'll see where this goes
it's still allegations
it's a complaint this isn't actually an
investigation or discovery at this time
we'll definitely be following the story
though Knox news items also pretty big
Intel has a huge 10 nanometer delay
problem and dont's delayed their 10
nanometer process once again it's been
years in the attempts at making now so
this time they're citing more production
problems and I will instead be shipping
14 nanometer iterations later this year
in the form of whiskey lake for client
pcs and cascade lake for server and data
center Intel originally promised 10
nanometer parts back in 2015 however
multiple delays saw in time of the
target date to 2017 and now onward 2017
became second half of 2018 which is not
happening at this point and as of now
and I won't begin hvm until an
unspecified time in 2019 for what it's
worth Intel claims to be shipping 10 Ana
meter in low volumes presently but will
not disclose what products and to whom
they've gone to in the meantime and
Tahoe has effectively been stuck at 40
nanometers since 2014 Intel cites issues
like aggressive scaling and density as
well as problems with their multi
patterning process for generating it too
many yield reducing defects to ship 10
nanometer cost-effectively until I
admitted they bit off more than they
could chew by increasing density 2.7 X
for the 10 nanometer transition
comparatively Intel only increased
density by 2.4 acts for the jump to 14
nanometers Intel is revisiting their 7
nanometer plans accordingly
learning from the production problems
that 10 nanometer has been fraught with
Intel asurs us and everyone else that
they've defined fixes and improvements
at this time and have a plan of action
but will take time to impact yields in a
significant and positive way the hiring
of Jim Keller a former MD engineer one
who was largely responsible for the Zen
architecture and I believe previously
Athlon 64
recent hiring of Jim Keller to lead the
silicon engineering group can be taken
as a signal fire that intel has to
succumb to stagnation and essentially
cede some advantage while they try and
get back to grips with their ten
nanometer process and their competitors
so we'll see where this goes but two
major items there that we just went over
ten nanometers delayed Jim Keller
networks at Intel having left Tesla and
previously AMD and to some extent Apple
a long time ago also interesting from
Intel last week was the AMD news show
this one's the Intel news show and the
release notes for a recent version of
Intel's at Rapid Storage Technology or
rst it's all suggested that the Z 390
chipset would replace the current
flagship Z 370 and will supposedly be
compatible with Intel's 10 nanometer
Cannon Lake if it ever exists
additionally a new AG DT X 299 successor
is ostensibly coming in the form of X
399 X 399 is listed as supporting both
coffee-like
and Cannon Lake parts and we can tell
you from our own information that you
can expect to see some new Intel
motherboards coming up in the next
couple of months we're not sure when
they'll be launching but keep an eye on
Computex that tends to be where we see
things like that copy text by the way
May 31st is when we'll be there it goes
from something like June 5th to June 9th
and we'll be on site reporting on
everything so make sure you subscribe so
you can catch our coverage of the show
also as noted previously from the
newsroom at Intel's website Intel has
hired silicon engineer and former Xen
architect Jim Keller to become senior VP
of silicon engineering Keller has worked
at AMD Tesla and Apple this move comes
just ahead of the news that Intel is
delaying its troubled ten nanometer
process yet again this no doubt implies
that Intel wants to assure investors
that their 10 nanometer ramps have their
full attention next thanks to the
volatile memory market
Samsung has unseated Intel as the
world's top chip vendor however fleeting
their lead maybe at 14.2% vs. Intel's
14-point zero percent regardless this is
a significant feat as Intel has held
that spot for more than 25 years Intel
emerged as the world's top semiconductor
man
back in 1992 when you could purchase the
Intel 486 processor
now there is one AMD news item how could
there not be after the last two years of
AMD news items and they revealed that
they have working seven nanometer GPU
silicon running in their labs in the
form of a Radeon instinct with Vega
architecture the silicon is fabricated
on TSM c7 and of your process as well
and these future 7 nanometre graphics
cards and these says that they are on
track to sample these seven nanometer
GPUs and epic two CPUs later this year
there's not much to say about this one
yet but it's interesting and there's a
job listing on indeed at the website
that shows Corsair is looking to hire a
product manager for displays for gaming
monitors we've continued to see Corsair
foray into many facets of PC hardware
everything from memory to power supplies
cases and generally leading the charge
with RGB LED is something that they are
very proud of it
and this also by the way includes chairs
and soon to openly water cooling parts
so now they're adding monitors to that
list the last news item here is just a
couple of hardware sales we spotted the
first ones kind of depressing EVGA is
1070 t is C gaming is presently $510
after a $100 discount from B&amp;amp;H photo and
some other retailer websites that will
link in the description below
510 bucks is pretty close to what they
were supposed to sell for so yes calling
it a sale from $100 over MSRP down back
to basically MSRP is sort of
disingenuous but at least it's close to
MSRP now one of the better deals we've
seen if you can call it that lately
basically the 1070 TI's were supposed
were originally 450 to 510 so being at
five times pretty close
also of course our vengeance lpx eight
gigabytes to buy four gigabyte kit at
3000 Hertz currently a hundred ten bucks
only two times what it should be which
is still a decent discount from where
wise so that's all for this one you can
find those links in the description
below along with everything else as
always go to patreon.com/scishow stop
that directly go to store ty cameras
nexus not match let's pick up one of our
GN mod mats on backorder or one of the
new GN glass crystals with the
tear down logo subscribe for more I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
