net and i'm back presenting the second
half of our recent interview with star
citizen's chris Roberts the first half
talks about some of the recent
developments in the game but primarily
looks at Direct X 12 both in an AP is in
this part of the interview we talked
about CryEngine and its architecture we
talked about the methodology and
approach to development of star citizen
zoning and instancing system which is
pretty critical to game and we've spoken
about that in depth with Chris in the
past so check the channel for instancing
and you will find that if you search the
channel for instancing and then finally
huge thanks to all of you for the
tremendously positive response we've
received on these interviews lately if
you want to help us figure out who to
interview next or if you have questions
for specific people star citizen or
otherwise please tweet them out at us at
gamers Nexus and I'll check those
personally see what we can do and we'll
set up more of these going forward
because they seem to be well liked so
that is all for the intro on this one
hit me patreon link as always if you
want to help us out in producing more of
this content and remaining fairly
independent from the traditional models
of the internet and enjoy the interview
with Chris I'll see you all next time
can you educate me on like a sort of
canonical view of the render pipeline
when you're drawing something like say
character model or a ship or something
like that what what does it look like a
cry engine or to the GPU what are the
sort of step-by-step processes when
you're rendering something well I mean
what happens is because it is threaded
essentially stuff gets pushed on to the
rent so what happens is in the sort of
accumulation of the main thread render
gets called and render basically on the
main thread site just starts pushing the
objects like you know the basically in
try entering the co render objects and
they get pushed on to sort of the render
key and it gets pushed on with the
information about the object including
it's location in 3d space because it's
going to
threaded so you can't depend on the
stuff for sitting the main thread so
just basically you know Thomas all this
stuff on to the render thread and then
the main loop goes about doing it stuff
again Wow the render thread carries on
doing stuff so basically the rendering
and the main loop that sort of happening
concurrently all the time and just at
the right end of the main loop that's a
bit where that the word the main loops
done gets pushed off to the render
thread and the render thread goes about
the work and actually transforming and
rendering and bring on rest this stuff
and you know then at that side on the 3d
engine side it sort of does the various
things that used to do like you know the
passes to the deck buffer and the shadow
maps and all the stencils and stuff that
you need for our kind of stuff and yeah
flash it out you know it's the CryEngine
rent beside itself you know it's a
pretty tricky complicated piece so
that's not one that I would be
personally like excited about
replastering do have had people here
that actually wrote much of it so you
know luckily like they they're all
working you know and they know it they
know it better than me because it's you
know it's I would say that it's it was
written back in the day where it was
less modularize and less sort of object
oriented or based so there's a lot of
slowly too dependent codes and checks on
flags that are passed down through
various levels a render that probably
wouldn't necessarily do today as well
and so those are kind of things that
don't worry part of the idea is to sort
of refactor the plumbing is sort of like
you got a house it looks really pretty
it's a really nice house but some of the
Plumbing's a bit old and you know you
got more quite have to go in and redo
the plumbing Greg you may not
necessarily realize that the Plumbing's
got some of the issues that have after
it the hot water will flow better right
here but you've got the you've her dance
from the Crytek people forget we
I have quite a few of the original core
engine team so we we know we've got I
think three of the original Far Cry team
carried on doing some of the from there
there and then there's quite a few that
have been from crisis one onwards from
the engine team so we have a decent we
don't have more there's plenty of other
ones that are also there in two minutes
of big companies lots of stuff but you
know we've got people that helped you
know basically build the engine design
architected so they know free inside out
so so that's that's very beneficial for
us it's usually if you're a licensee you
wouldn't have that knowledge which is
useful for us because we're trying to do
something very different than you would
normally use CryEngine for me and you
must be honest what we're doing is
different than doesn't matter whether it
be unreal or unity or CryEngine we would
a lot of the refactoring we've been
having to do we would have to do yeah
especially the 64-bit stuff at 64 bits
the big also just kind of approaching
spatialization and sort of kind of data
passing differently because of the vast
scale we have and scope and the fact
that we can have a high density of like
information and data but then also
passed areas of nothing so you know more
traditional sort of spatialization
techniques like our trees and stuff are
particularly useful for what we do so we
need things a little bit more dynamic to
be possibly so that's that's something
you've mentioned a few times with me now
the arc trees what what is that okay
well basically where is it it's just
sort of like stop dividing it's like I
take a cube ah right and then I can go
inside this tube and say just imagine me
subdividing into 4 more cubes okay when
you go into one of those cubes you can
subdivide it into 4 more cubes so it's
just it's a it's a way to sort of pass
out essentially areas a data for like
figuring out whether you're included in
our food or whether you be visible in
the camera fairly efficiently
without having to have it as flat like a
flat list I was like it's one thing you
could use up a flat list of objects and
you could just check them against the
view frustum whether they will be in the
camera not encounter right but then you
know if you have ten thousand objects in
the scene you check against 10,000 now
doing something like this you could say
oh well you know you could you could
basically take a view frustum you know
and essentially figure out against a
tree and then figure out what sort of
containers essentially would be visible
and then you would deal with the object
and so you move rent typically in the
engines you move the the writer objects
around these around an octree structure
and it's just sort of an efficient way
to kind of get to and pass and figure
out what object or what area pretty
query but it's you know it's sort of
more it's more rigid right it's sort of
like you start with a certain size and
subdivides down a path down so it's not
it's not quite as flexible or movable
because we have issues like you know
like this is what the zone system does
is you know imagine having a planet
right and this planet has city and other
people on it right well there's own
system and you know really what we call
his own container holds all that now if
that planet is orbiting right moving
through our space right what would
happen in an up tree because a nut tree
has no a nun trees fixed that would mean
that there the planet and the object on
it would all actually be transitioning
from one part one area the artery to
another area tree you'd have to be
moving them around you'd be sorting them
inside your artery all the time right
you sorting thousands of objects but
with us that's not the case because we
have these zones what's own containers
with you the way you are big of them and
the zone containers contain their own
frame of reference and so we basically
it you know like a Russian doll you
contain things two things at the very
top level we move the very top level
around you don't have to move anything
inside that top level because there are
still relative
to each other perfectly right so and so
it allows us to do things like planetary
orbits or ships flying around with lots
of stuff inside and not worry so much
about you know like moving around and
moving them around a fixed the spatial
data structure so it's much more much
more suitable for our uses it's not a
typical use in a 3d game is usually in a
3d game the structure itself is like
you're walking around a map well that's
fixed right right so you know the plants
and the buildings they aren't moving so
that's fine they can all be because the
artery then allows you to sort of
determine which plants are what part of
building you'd see really quickly and
the only things are really moving
through them at things like your
character or a bullet or something like
that sure and so typical shooter things
like a most engines use an up 34 sort of
its its kind of render like pipeline
basically relative what you'll see what
you want to see everything else but for
us obviously it's not that suitable will
be doing a bunch of work that would
rather not be doing and and and you you
know and even though our trees are
fairly efficient in sorting data and
moving data around because you're just
generally moving pointers around when
it's a big enough space and big enough
data it you know it does actually take
an appreciable time so what we do allows
for sort of the moving of because like
you can always think of a big spaceship
is a mini IPS level on a planet as many
FPS level or something like that so it
allows for the movement of these things
without having to you know have the
challenges of you know a fixed spatial
data structure right we can and we can
sort of scale the data structure inside
each one of the zones to be appropriate
for the data we have inside it that's
this is why I level talking to devs who
are more familiar with like the
engineering side of things because we as
you know we look at a lot of hardware
mostly and to understand the hardware
properly it really helps to understand
some of the
through our driving it rights that's
where my knowledge fool is really
shallow so it definitely a huge help you
get the walkthrough much appreciated on
that I'm throw it all</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
