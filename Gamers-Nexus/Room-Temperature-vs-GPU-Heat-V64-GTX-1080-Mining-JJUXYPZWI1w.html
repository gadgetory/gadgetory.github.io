GTX 1080 but how much does that impact
room-temperature that's what we wanted
to know and we eventually expanded that
concept to include how much a 940 watt
mining machine increases room
temperature and how much a 600 watt
machine and so on we were able to
effectively replace any need of a heater
for the past week as well and right when
it started get colder so in this test
we're looking at the room ambient impact
of various PC builds and wattages and
whether or not you can replace your
heater with your computer before we get
into that this content is brought to you
by the thermal take flow RGB closed-loop
liquid cooler which is a three hundred
sixty millimeter radiator plus three 120
fans that are RGB illuminated if then
we'll take it rain fans at that this is
a 4.5 done a stack pump which is one of
the faster pumps you can learn more at
the link in the description below
although this test is a little bit
harder to control than our usual tests
to quote friend of the site VSG it's the
right balance of science flaw and
madness to make for an entertaining
educational video and that's really what
we were targeting something that's kind
of real-world very interesting and can
be somewhat controlled if not perfectly
this test started off just trying to
look at actually 1070 and Vega 56 but
there wasn't enough of a power load
there to even really begin the test so
we moved it up to Vega 64 and a 1080 and
then we started ramping into the higher
wattage units and ultimately this type
of test is inherently very flawed but
we'll lay out everything we did for
testing and then hopefully establish how
it can apply to you or where it applies
the most because obviously when you're
testing room scale temperatures you're
dealing with things like insulation age
of the house or building the external
temperature what you're doing with AC or
HVAC during the tests and if you're
going to do things like block the door
with a wet towel or anything like that
it's preventing heat from escaping so
there's a lot of places where there are
decision points and we chose to stick it
to mostly realism so we're controlling
to a point and then we're trying to
implement some more realistic scenarios
for the testing in
and for these tests we spoke with a
thermal engineer in the industry and
with vsg of thermal bench and that helps
us plan but we did have to make a couple
of decisions on our own there are a lot
of variables here we're not going to
attempt to control for all of them but
we discussed the possibility of for
example testing in a thermal chamber but
the Chamber's we have access to and have
used in the past are small just big
enough for me to stand inside of it so
it would have heated up fast and
wouldn't really relay real-world room
temperature we ultimately decided to
test in an actual bedroom in an actual
house and this means we have four walls
insulation a door a small gap under the
door a ceiling fan and all of the other
things you'd have in a room for room
setup we configured the ceiling fan to
spin out of medium speed and left the 60
watt ceiling light on for the entire
test as this will generate a minor
amount of additional heat if
insignificant the idea is that a user
who's trying to combat rising room
temperature would probably have the fan
on to some degree and you'll probably
have a light on while you're in there we
considered blocking the underside of the
door with a wet towel to help isolate
the room and the testing but ultimately
decided against it there's no real point
in controlling for that type of variable
when there are inherently so many others
with this type of test and in a real
world scenario no user is going to do
that so we left that one out we also did
control for as much as we could the
external weather factors though we ran
all tests on different days giving the
room time to cool down between each test
so we waited for similar or identical as
far as they can be weather conditions
outside to run the tests and that meant
that the tests took a couple of weeks to
run because we're waiting for the right
conditions and also allowing the room to
cool down rerunning tests as we found
flaws with the methods and improving
them and things like that so there's a
lot of data that was used to improve
testing for the final data set we also
had to decide what to do with AC so we
considered disabling it entirely but
ultimately decided to configure AC to
regulate a temperature of 70 degrees
Fahrenheit or 21 degrees Celsius and
here's the next challenge the thermostat
is located in the hallway outside of the
room
iemon now that you're watching this on
the builds were on this table
and the hallway is not too far away it's
a couple feet away so the thermostats
there which means that the temperature
sensor is also there and AC won't trip
until that sensor reaches whatever the
value is 70 F in this case so the
temperature in this room is somewhat
isolated but as more heat sort of slowly
seeps out under the underside of the
door and gets out there it will trigger
AC now this was by design and were
pointed it out for a few reasons
we placed a thermocouple down the hall
in one of the colder rooms as the
coldest room in the house there's
another one down the hall placed a
thermocouple there that's our control
room and then we placed two in here one
was one foot away from the computer
where you would be sitting the other one
was in the center of the room about six
feet away from the computer
this room is sized that 15 foot 4 by 9
foot 9 we're measuring temperature every
second or so over a period of several
hours to allow steady states who be
achieved if possible some tests went as
long as seven hours and we're still not
at steady-state at the end but had to
call it there so just to give an idea
thermocouples again positioned in two
places in this room and the point of all
of this is to highlight that this is an
imperfect test but it's an academic
experiment it's it gives us enough good
data that we can still figure out how
much a computer would heat up a room
given these parameters that I've just
spent the last few minutes laying out so
the point of saying all that is so you
can figure out if it relates to you and
either way we've controlled for our
environment as much as possible so it
gives you a good idea now if you're
sitting in a warehouse or something like
that obviously your mileage will vary
tremendously if you're in a warehouse
but I don't have to really worry about
this at all because it's just gonna
spread out but that's where we're
starting so your mileage will vary
depending on your AC policy things like
that but seemingly small things like
keeping the door closed which we did can
have a big impact on tests depending on
how you do it at home so your results
would it change based on that as well
opening the door for instance would help
a huge amount maybe for some reason you
want to keep it closed maybe you have
pets who jump on your test bench for
example so those are our variables and
our controls let's get into the data so
to recap our AC power
see quickly we had the AC on during the
900 watt mining machine test it came on
occasionally and that's because if we
allowed the room ambient to reach 40 50
C maybe not 50 but 40 C that's obviously
becoming a fire hazard so we've got some
limitations there the AC was basically
off and all the other tests because the
room didn't get hot enough to see peed
out into the hallway and trigger AC so
it was on for 900 watts and basically
off for the other two we're starting
with the most extreme experiment since
that's the most fun one to look at this
is from our 940 watt temporary mining
machine which used a mixture of four GT
X 1080 and 1080i GPUs we had three tea
eyes and one 1080 all configured to 70%
power limits with 100 to 150 megahertz
core overclocks and a 250 megahertz
under clock the fans were also blasting
and we had a few fans positioned on the
table to reduce heat in key locations
and the idea was to avoid burning down
the video set while all of these were
going though we also had the CPU burning
for crypto night for which we used a
1950 X under the lick tech three sixty
millimeter cooler power sat at around
940 watts at the wall all said and done
and for results here's what we got room
ambient for this test started at around
20 degrees Celsius with our control room
at around 20 point four degrees at one
foot of distance the room temperature
increases by five degrees within a
half-hour and keeping the door closed
this of course means that it's going to
be a bit more accelerated than if you
opened the door the temperatures at the
1 hour mark climbed to twenty-seven
point five degrees for those using
Fahrenheit that'd be a climb of about 69
Fahrenheit to about eighty one point
five Fahrenheit in the span of an hour
our AC kicks in at this point and
regulates the control room and hallway
down to the target temperature where we
briefly saw temperature drops in this
test room of about 1.5 degrees between
AC cycles we managed to climb all the
way up to about thirty degrees Celsius
following three hours of testing and
that's while AC was battling the
temperature rise on occasion in
Fahrenheit that puts us at 86 degrees
effectively eliminating the need for
heating
in the room during winter actually it
sort of starts necessitating AC middle
of the room temperatures aren't quite as
bad as being in the combat seat with a
maximum temperature of about twenty
eight point one degrees as for power
consumption the charts about to get kind
of messy this Green Line mapped to the
right axis represents power consumption
during the test this machine was running
nice hash back before it was hacked and
that's what loaded the rig fairly evenly
for the testing period if you had a
similar room setup two hours a bedroom
attached to HVAC and with its door
closed you're looking at high room
temperatures from something like a
mighty machine or a rendering machine or
anything that generates a 900 watt load
we went five degrees over control and
just half an hour and reached nine
degrees Celsius over in about three
hours and just to establish a point here
it doesn't matter how you generate the
heat it's still heat it's still wattage
so if you are pulling 900 watts through
some insane gaming machine we're pulling
900 watts through a rendering machine or
900 watts through a mining machine it's
all 900 watts doesn't matter how you
create the power in this instance as
long as it's created in a steady way it
will heat the room up in the same
fashion so it doesn't matter what you're
using to create the temperature
basically or create the heat load and
the power load more appropriately stated
this next test is closer to a high-end
gaming or production machine and
consumes about 600 watts of power
looking at this fire strike chart from
our gtx 1070 TI review we can see that a
crossfire configuration was pulling
about 460 watts for the system with our
power modded vega 56 at 447 watts for
the system a 600 watt machine would be
similar to running to 1080 T is at Full
Tilt's with a lighter load on the CPU or
running a an overclocked I 9 CPU with a
high end GPU this chart from our 79 80 X
a review helps reinforce that it's not
hard to make CPUs draw 500 watts alone
if you're running in an h EDT class part
these CPU power charts were measured at
the rails so that's just the CPU for
those knowing that our next test is at
600 watts so it's a bit more achievable
but still on the high side this machine
progresses somewhat linearly as the
temperature never reached a point of
tripping the AC
from the hallway sensor the 900 watt
machine had just enough heat seeping
into the hallway that a/c triggered more
frequently and so this test once again
shows its imperfections and limited
control that said it's good to see how
the room temperature behaves when left
uncontested by a/c and is all ultimately
experimental not comparative anyway with
no a/c to help out the room temperature
starts at about 20 degrees Celsius for
all of our probes reaching only 21
degrees after half an hour so no big
deal by the one hour point we're at 22
degrees this climbs again to 24 degrees
after 2 hours so it's almost perfectly
linear temperature still hasn't reached
steady state and so we allowed the test
to run for 7 4 hours at the end of all
this we're at 25 point six degrees and
climbing higher as it's still not
perfectly steady state that said seven
hours is a long time to run a machine at
full tilt
so keeping with our theme of realism if
you're running a 600 watt machine for
seven hours you're probably rendering or
encoding something and that means you
can probably exit the room if you wanted
to our final test is the one that
prompted all this we know that Vega is
power-hungry
more power-hungry than its direct
competitors the 1070 or the 1080 for 56
and 64 so we wanted to compare 1080 to
have a 64 card and see that given the
higher power load created by Vega 64 is
there also an appreciable change in room
temperature with this particular room so
that's the next and final test this test
was a loopy and firestrike benchmark for
a few hours and here's the power
consumption chart the Vega 64 system
consumed about 360 to 380 watts on
average where the GTX 1080 system
consumed 302 330 watts on average this
50 watt peak to peak amplitude manifests
itself minimally in room thermals as you
can see in this chart of temperature
from the combat seat once again a 1 foot
distance after a few hours the Vega 64
card heated our room by about an
additional one to 1.25 degrees Celsius
over the 1080 card and given the
inherently difficult nature of
controlling this test you know we can
sort of write this off as functionally
equal and start mattering as you stacked
more and more cards but with single card
gaming machines under gaming workloads
with this type of power load it's just
not showing up in rooms
this is also without AC ever triggering
to even turn on so there wasn't enough
of a temperature change for it to fire
if the room were smaller we had more
machines running or if it were already
hot outside this might be more
noticeable our chart of temperatures
from the middle of the room it shows
largely the same performance though the
temperatures are even closer as we get
farther from the PC making it even less
relevant and that pretty much wraps it
up so this testing was a lot of fun it
was different
again it's an academic experiment the
900 watt to 1 kilowatt load whether
that's a gaming machine overclocking
machine or mining clearly creates a big
impact and just to exit all the
objective data and speak subjectively
walking into this room at the end of the
test at the end of the mining test was
noticeable it's like walking into a wall
of heat like if you transition straight
into a desert basically so going from 20
degrees on the other side of the door to
30 in here is definitely noticeable it's
enough to make you sweat a little bit
depend on who you are and so that's an
area where obviously you pay for what
you're running in terms of how you feel
personally in the room now opening the
door again subject to leave this wasn't
measured opening the door definitely
helped a pretty good amount in terms of
human feeling probably drop the
temperature by about maybe 3 degrees
after it was allowed time for air to
kind of circulate out of the room again
and so that would certainly help if you
had that capability another option of
course turn on a/c to run it all the
time or open a window or any number of
things you could do to combat this but
clearly within a relatively controlled
environment there is a a direct increase
in room temperature versus your
computer's power consumption so that's
pretty cool and this is where things
come into play of how much does power
consumption matter how much does a heat
load matter all that all that stuff but
between two competing cards head-to-head
even with a an 80 watt difference
amplitude peak to peak is obviously not
a huge change so we were looking at one
degree 464 versus a 1080 after a couple
hours probably not going to notice that
much in this type of room maybe if you
were gaming in a really small room with
no AC and you got other machines running
you might notice it at that point but
doesn't look like it's gonna be nearly
as noticeable as just going from
something like single card to crossfire
or SLI for example so that's all for
this one as pretty funds has to do let
us know what you thought of this idea
post comments below if you have similar
test ideas to this one that or maybe
less easy to control but still fun from
a scientific standpoint and as always
you can go to patreon.com/scishow and
exit stops out directly if you would
prefer to not use patreon you can go to
store that gamers nexus net the bridge
is a shirt like this one subscribe for
more and we'll see you all next time
crossfire or a for example so that's it
for this one kind of fun let us know
