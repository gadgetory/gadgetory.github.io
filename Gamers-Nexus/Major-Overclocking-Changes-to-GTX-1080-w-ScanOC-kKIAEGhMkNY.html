dotnet and I'm joined again by Tom
Peterson from Nvidia and we're gonna be
talking about some of the new Pascal
stuff so the most interesting item to me
here at least is overclock and it's
changed a lot in the interface so how
has it changed well it's pretty exciting
you know when you look at overclocking
what you're trying to do is extract
margin that is built into the design to
account for a variation of games or
variation of silicon or variation of
boards and the way you want to figure
this out is you want to test your chip
running a real game and figure out if
it's stable at a particular frequency
now GPU boost 2 which is on Maxwell only
allowed you to add a fixed frequency
offset to your stock voltage frequency
curve what we've done with Pascal is
said you know we're leaving a lot of
headroom on the table what if we
actually instead of having a fixed
offset apply across the whole curve we
can now let users do a frequency offset
for each point of the weak voltage
frequency curve so what that allows you
to do is really get much much closer to
what I call the theoretical horizon of
your GPU performance right
so it's think of it as if you had to
have one frequency offset somewhere
along that curve you'd fail because it's
linear and now by allowing it to be
deformed to match your real GPU you can
get higher performance now we've also
since we've gotten a lot more
programmable on how you can overclock
we've enabled something called an OC
scanner and now an OC scanner is another
tool that will kind of generate this per
frequency I'm sorry per voltage
frequency offset for you and it does it
by automatically running tests over and
over and over locking to a particular
voltage and then increasing the
frequency offset until a point of
failure now in Biddy's add a whole bunch
of stuff to allow that tool to run
efficiently without locking up your
system so you're doing things like
comparisons of values in the frame
buffer trying to figure out hey is the
GPU had a miss compare rather than a
hard crash because that's a much better
way to fail right so the OSI scanner is
think of it as the engine that's now
testing your GPU against a particular
workload
and then it's writing the results of
that scan into that manual overclocking
table and how long does the scan take to
complete and it's completely up to the
individual AIC that's doing the tool but
we've recommended that it's configurable
so you can configure how long do I test
each point what is the range of you know
frequencies that I want to test so if
you only want to look for say between
150 and 300 millivolts I'm sorry 300
megahertz frequency you can configure
that in your drill you can also
configure how big of a step do I take on
the frequency if you got more time you
run the test longer and you take smaller
steps and you'll get a more accurate
curve so if I'm an enthusiast who enjoys
overclocking it sounds like this tool is
taking my job away from me well yeah how
do you can you enabling the enthusiast
well the enthusiasts still has all the
normal tweaks that they had before where
they can get in there and dial their own
thing and the OSI scanner is is is going
to be limited because effectively it's
going to run one application it's not
going to be running a whole bunch of
different applications but again I think
humans are gonna end up doing a little
better job kind of tweaking it up there
for their particular use and and they're
gonna enjoy we do have three modes of
the overclocking now before we just had
that fixed offset now you can do fixed
offset or you can do a linear
interpolation so you know it turns out
that the voltage frequency offset
capability increases or decreases based
on where are you in the curve so by
having a linear interpolation you can
actually extract more performance and
finally there's that manual mode that
you could get in there and like plug in
every single voltage and frequency point
or you can use that as sort of the
target of an OC scanner very cool and
then before we go here at SMP oh I need
to find that for us I can SMP stands for
simultaneous multi-project and what it's
all about is if you remember I was
talking about the world that's created
in geometry and then mapping that world
to a two-dimensional screen that process
is called projection and it's been done
forever onto a single screen or a single
projection because really that's all we
had well what's actually changed is now
you people have surround configurations
and and there's VR and effectively the
screen
that we all are interacting with are
becoming more complex so what this
technology allows us to do think of it
as transforming the projection that we
look into when we're trying to calculate
pixels and that by transforming that
geometry we can match what's really
happening with your displays it removes
distortion it can improve efficiency and
it's just I mean it's just like an
obvious thing to do
at the end of the days you can imagine
things like lenticular displays and a
mental reality and even even circular
displays you may walk into some day and
if you do that what you really want to
be able to do is look around anywhere
and see the correct projection and that
that type of environment will require
continued innovation on projection
manipulation and we're definitely
heading that way and does that work so
obviously VR is in there as a focus
point yeah what about curved screens
like the ultra wide
yeah I mean we support 16 different
transforms for a single view of
projection so that means you could sort
of slice up a curved screen into 16
different slices and approximate that
that curved surface now it is an in-game
thing so it's up to game developers to
take advantage of the new capability
provided by MV API right yeah so to
learn more about this stuff as always
links in the description below and by by
this point we should have all the basic
information you need online yeah some
people I think you're gonna be I think
you're gonna be blown away by Pascal
when you get it home so check back for
that because we will have more of it but
thank you Tom for joining me see ya and
we'll see you all next time okay take
care guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
