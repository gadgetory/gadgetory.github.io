joined by thermal Mike from thermaltake
we're gonna be talking about some common
misconceptions and mistakes with liquid
cooling because we're both talking about
this there's a lot of things we see
people do wrong with liquid cooling you
because it's their first time or they
haven't learned the right way or
whatever so let's start with the common
mistakes what are some of the most
frequent mistakes you see when you look
down like YouTube videos and stuff like
that well you know I see a lot of stuff
of course you know a lot of people also
ask me hey what's the best way to go you
know the most important thing I would
see is making sure that the tubing is
going to fit in the fitting properly
because a lot of people might cut a
little corner and you know that little
corner can be a big problem for you
later down the road so making sure that
the tube fits into the fitting
everything's tight you know but not too
tight some people get a little freaked
out about over tightening things and
especially with a lot of blocks that are
now acrylic you know seeing the
transparent stuff I mean you can
definitely see that become a problem you
know people get a little too over
anxious about some things right so you
know us here at Thermaltake we're trying
to educate people you know show them
what you can learn from us as far as
using our product I mean like our
fittings for example they have a 300
ring design so there's two o-rings on
the inside with an additional overhang
on the owl and it's a compression
fitting so it secures it properly so
it's really important to look at that
when you're looking at you know
different fittings different colors
there's a lot of options out there so we
want to make sure that the Thermaltake
option is going to be a good option yeah
I guess to give folks some credentials
you do liquid cooling all day every day
I mean you did this mod and a couple
days right yeah it was a couple of days
I mean the paint process took a little
bit but once we got that and then you
know also Asus hook this up with this
Maximus 9 board and we got that like
last minute because it was kind of a
rush you know for CES you know typical
stuff but get a couple days put it
together do the tube work a lot of fun
yeah Mike does a lot of liquid go a
knows it stop let's talk about mixing
metals that's another really common
thing we hear about like mixing aluminum
and copper or nickel plated conference
whatever give us a rundown on that so I
mean you know most of our blocks that we
offer are nickel plated for the most
part a lot of our newer SKUs are kits a
copper coal plate but it's nickel plated
to you know prevent the corrosion stuff
and everything and a lot of our new line
is all nickel plated so it makes it real
a rule neutral to be able to be used in
a lot of different complex systems right
and using different products we do also
have other products at our copper based
but that does fall on the coolant what
type of coolant you use and is that
coolant going to support mixed metals
you know for example RC 1000 opaque
supports a lot of different mixed metals
more than what you may see out there so
we're just trying to make things even
just more options more user-friendly
more compatibility okay the main thing
that we're looking out for there I guess
is corrosion right yeah yeah because I
mean you know corrosion or stuff growing
in there and all that kind of stuff you
want to make sure that you don't put
just regular water definitely not
something from the tap right but you
know our cooling scum premix got all
their biocides and stuff in there so
that way the coolant should last you a
good 12 months we usually recommend a
flush at least within 12 months and with
with mentioning biocides so most these
cool at least want to you so that's
those agents are mixed in there is there
a case where someone would want to add
their own bio side well yeah if you get
a coolant that does not have a bio side
in it then you're definitely know it's
something you have to look into her like
a kill coil you know a lot of those
different additives stuff that they have
to premix it but it you get the formula
mixed a little wrong you can have some
chemical reactions so to make it a
little bit easier we like to have a
pre-mixed solution versus everybody
having to figure out you know what's the
best mix and you know they feel more
comfortable with the building what have
i walls that was the other thing I'm
talking about
I built this I do my liquid Cola have
seen a ton of bubbles should I be
freaked out yeah I mean one of the
things I get from a lot of people is
they'll send me a picture of their
system right and they'll be like hey
there's all these bubbles in here is
this gonna go is it's a problem is it
gonna overheat you know I mean just
relax I mean a lot of times is gonna
take a little bit to work one thing i
usually recommend is put power just to
the pump itself let the pump run for a
while let the system run and purge all
the air out sometimes you might have to
tilt the system a little bit get that
bubble out but it's always good to do
that everything else is off no power to
it and then once you get everything
comfortable you feel comfortable about
it then go ahead and fire it up yeah
right we're just running the power
through though all the liquid components
liquid cooling components first makes a
whole lot of sense cuz then you're at
really no risk of damaging the
even in the event of a league yeah yeah
if you have a leak and everything's off
it's the safest way to go yeah there's
the other thing as with leaks how
frequent are they where do things
normally leak how do you prevent that
type of thing well I would say the most
important thing to prevent and where
you're going to see the issue probably
the most is your fittings because that's
the largest quantity of problems that
can occur and then with the fitting
making sure that when you do especially
hard tubing that the hard tube is cut
properly and it fits all the way into
the fitting don't cut corners there
folks because that could be a small
little leak that you'll see we're the
first day or maybe even later and you're
like oh hey what happened you know so
keeping sure that you know what's going
on and making sure everything's set up
right is real important any other
misconceptions or mistakes you want to
throw in before we sign off here I think
you see a lot that grinds your gears
well you know I mean a lot of people
will take a back on you know our
aluminum Zara radiators or aluminum
right I mean a lot of people may not
know most all AIO radiators out there
are aluminum based I mean it's a common
thing we're blog people might not think
of it that way but we do protect it and
we are looking into some other solutions
as well so definitely stay tuned for
some other options and more stuff from
thermal take care as we go into 2017
great calls for more information as
