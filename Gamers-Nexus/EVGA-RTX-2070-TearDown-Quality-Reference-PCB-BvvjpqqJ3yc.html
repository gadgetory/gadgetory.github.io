r-tx 2070 cards out there $500 invidious
requirement to send $500 cards to media
was discussed in our review and this is
the one we wanted to take apart because
the $500 cards are almost certainly
always going to use a reference PCB and
video did not sample austin fe card and
to our understand they didn't sample
really anyone in fe card but this has
the same PCB so we can still look at
what you would get from an MP card if
you wanted to liquid cooler or something
like that and also it's 500 bucks is
about the price point the 2070 should be
anyway so we're gonna take it apart and
see what the EVGA r-tx 2070 non-branded
edition looks like because that's how
cheap it is it doesn't even doesn't say
what it is anywhere on there other than
our TX 2070 so they don't have a special
name for it this time before that this
video is brought to you by the Corsair
strafe RGB mark to mechanical gaming
keyboard the strafe mark 2 uses Cherry
MX which is available in MX red and MX
silent and uses the elevated key cap
design that has become part of course
there's keyboard identity elevated key
caps make the keyboard much easier to
clean with a blast of compressed air and
limit dirt build up the keyboard use a
metal body design of have received
praise from us in the past in old
reviews for high build quality learn
more about the Corsair strafe mark 2 at
the link in the description below
technically evj does have a name for
this they call it the RT x 2070 black
but there's there's really no way to
know that unless you talk to their PR
rep and then you figure out that's the
name so this is the 27 t blacks 500 are
card there are more expensive models
they have been ultra silent that I
think's 550 or 600 but at that point you
start exiting the value argument of the
2070 so 500 to bat where it should be
and you get basically a reference card
with theoretically a less bad cooler but
we'll have to I don't know if we ever
get the FE card we can test it out but
based on previous experience probably
this is going to be less bad than the FE
and we do have thermal data on this in
our review so we're going to take this
thing apart it's pretty straightforward
it's gonna be a lot of Phillips drivers
and that's about it so reasons you would
want to do this of course for
so we want to see what the PCB and the
vrm look like are they quality what kind
of ER mr is nvidia using because this is
a reference model so even though evj is
buying the reference board or the design
from nvidia we still need to know if
it's any good and we're gonna be using
our mod mat here to track the screw
placement so you can pick one of those
up on store documents accessing that if
you want a work surface a PC building
and modding work surface and we're using
it's not they're not advertised but
we're using the iFixit toolkit and we
just like to know that because we do
think it's one of the better one so this
is the protec toolkit well link both
those below so this thing so far it's
pretty straightforward we've got just a
lot of Phillips head screws it's trivial
compared to the founders edition card
the one difference being that the back
plates kind of odd so being a $500 card
and this is a really interesting problem
that partners face it's really not
possible to put just a straight good
cooler on here a lot of the really good
coolers costs about $50 or up depending
on what kind of cool you are talking
about when we're talking about let's say
1080i class cards if you were talking
about a card that was sort of like icx
class something like that icx high-end
windforce Strix any of those you're
looking at 50 bucks plus or minus maybe
10 for the coolers and these there's
really not a lot of room for any
manufacturers to price out of cooler
because they're spending so much on the
GPU itself of course and then they're
trying to keep a $500 price point so for
the backplate going back to what I was
saying you know with this thing where
it's like it's helling really haired it
doesn't need to be there at all you just
blow air straight through it I suppose
it looks a bit better but that's all you
end up with for the place so it's not
really a backplate it's just a back of
heatsink that hangs over PCB plate at
this point and the PCB as you've likely
noticed by now is short Oh interesting
okay good
miss misread the screws for a second so
PCB is short which places the the power
pin out right in the middle there like
we've seen on Vega cards and some other
cards I think Polaris cards do that in
the past the GTX 1060 did that as well
so this is not uncommon the only way to
really push
the power headed over here and NVIDIA
did this with a 1060 reference card or
Founders edition card is to stick it
over there and then wire just run some
lawn wires over to the PCB which is
really obnoxious to take apart and
completely pointless so we're glad that
EVGA didn't opt to do that here because
this this makes more sense it's easier
to maintain this sticker I'll just note
so this is not a warranty void to remove
sticker we've asked the EVGA about these
in the past even though it says EVGA
everywhere they're not going to void
your warranty if you have clearly
tampered with it well you could remove
it easily if you wanted to that's not
gonna avoid it just because there's a
hole in that if you for example stuck a
water cooler on this PCB it's a tamper
seal so they can figure out what you've
changed and what they do with that data
I don't know I would if we're hoping
they're only doing good things with it
then it would be that they are trying to
figure out where to troubleshoot
problems but it could also be used to
figure out if there's reason to void a
warranty I suppose we just we don't
actually know how to resell trees
they're doing so yeah screw nuttin screw
on the iOS plate which is pretty common
practice by a there's not one here but
just screw there at this point we can
probably separate them without removing
the screws from that weird backplate and
it's got a base plate that's separating
as well we have a combined power cable
and here that you can see so I need to
disconnect that and the safest way
possible which is going to be avoiding
pulling on the cables there we go looks
clean cool so we did not break anything
that's good toys a goal so for this if
you do take one of these apart just
stick a fingernail under the corner here
and Paul don't pull the cables it's very
easy to rip them out so here's the card
we've already done thermal testing on
this on mind you we have testing with
stock pastes and testing with
aftermarket solutions in the main review
if you want to see those and then we
also tested with well in the future with
thermocouples under the base plate
because I mean that's why we're taking
this apart right now
so okay baseplate can come off at this
point let's remove that and then look at
it further okay pretty straightforward
so what we end up with is a flat base
plate there's no real surface area there
and the base plate is aluminum it's got
that going for it
it is conductive it's just not
dissipative in any meaningful way and
that's sitting with it's got a hole for
the inductor line right here to look at
and this now look at the PCB
this explains partly why we're limited
in power target 214 percent it's a very
weak power target and it's not the
strongest beer around but we'll have
builds I'd look at it as well and let's
pull some of the pads off so should be
how much one two three four five six oh
yeah eight memory modules as expected
let's just remove these for now I need a
spudger so this is iFixit spudger that
they actually include on with the pro
tect toolkit to you but we like these
removing thermal pads it's a good way to
kind of prevent them from tearing apart
as you remove them or stretching that's
the bigger problem if you pull at it
it'll stretch and if you need to reapply
it that becomes increasingly difficult
as it stretches out so I'm just gonna
put this over here so I can kind of
remember where it goes and I might as
well reveal the die we haven't seen this
die yet so that'll be new typically EVGA
uses shin-etsu paste for some of their
cards we don't know what they're using
on this one it is a lower end model but
they did change their paste for the
twenty series it's normally a non or
well fairly non-hearing compound but
time will tell how it holds up we don't
know what the reason on this one there
that's the 20 70 die first time we've
we've seen this in person this is the tu
106 - 400 - a1 and normally the a1 is
just a revision numbers that's really
insignificant at this point so tu 106 -
400 is the GPU or the silicon just going
to clean off the base plate of a cold
plate as well this is a
nickel plated copper cold plate so for
the heat pipes here going into the plate
the most important thing with heat pipes
is not how many there are
despite what manufacturers like to use
for marketing its where do they contact
and in this instance there are large
heat pipes we can measure those those
look like probably ten millimeter that's
ten so those are ten millimeter heat
pipes there are three of them of course
for the GPU and actually for the whole
card the whole card they're three and
they do go right down the center so
you've got good contact on one and then
maybe half of each of these two here you
end up with a bit of a radius issue or
the chamfered edge you lose all of your
contact there so hopefully it's soldered
to the cold plate at that point to
increase the thermal transfer but that's
why sometimes you'll see a bunch of four
or six typically six millimeter pipes
instead of larger fewer larger pipes
just because it's better overall contact
the pan and how it's built but they've
got three of those on here
adding thermal paste to the mod mat with
all the other if they're home paste
needs a cleaning stains been through
like probably a year of use at this
point including my literal blood on the
mat and also lots of water cooling
spills so it's durable
it'll hold up to a lot you should buy
one on stored I hear as excess that net
so that's the cooler what we end up with
is aluminum fins as always some of these
are l-shaped fins on the bottom which is
a blockage to airflow depend on what is
sitting over so what is that sitting
over that's gonna be sitting over the
inductors which are probably the hottest
part of the vrm with the MOSFETs very
close second and having those L shaped
fins although it blocks air flow will
allow for direct contact between the
thermal pad and the fin stack with the
inductors and that is actually more
valuable than allowing air flow to get
down there for the most part although
air flow is just fine if you take the
cooler off and blast it there and then
let's just go ahead and remove this
backplate just out of curiosity now
after that we can look at the BRM and
this requires a smaller bit you're
keeping track at home
that's plastic this is actually a
plastic backplate with rubber bumpers on
it probably for vibration or spacing so
this actually does nothing highly then
brands the cars and maybe looks cool to
some people so there's the rest the
cooler then pretty basics got two fans
on it and a couple of 10 millimeter heat
pipes as for the cold plate so it's a
copper cold plate nickel plated copper
heat pipes are copper nickel plated as
well and that's important this time
because of cheap cards so you never know
might go aluminum these are indeed
copper and then they also have this gate
they've added on to hide the cable a bit
and they tape the cable down so just
some level of detail notes for you
cables not using all the pins either so
I believe they could fit either led
functionality or maybe another fan into
this header if they wanted to you can
see they're only using about two thirds
60% of the cable of the header I should
say this card has no LEDs so that may be
what it was originally intended for in
higher-end models or something so that's
all I have on the cooler it's really
very basic the base plate also very
basic just but just an aluminum plate
the vrm is using on semi NCP 302 155
MOSFETs and some cheap and doctors and
that's for the vcore vrm so no doubling
scheme or anything here I don't think
let's just double check ok so here's
some of the controllers on the back so
for the controllers we've got a u p9 v 1
2 R right there that's what that one is
and build xored will talk about this
stuff in his PCB analysis if he does one
for us talk about the capabilities of
this then current wise and there's also
a non semi brick over here which is a
four or five four nine one on semi on
the back for shunt resistors
there's this shunt resistor here this is
a five million shot and there's probably
only one except for the one for the PCIe
slot there's another one
this shunt resistor right here the R
zero zero five that almost certainly
goes to the PCIe slot and then the one
on the back probably goes to the pin out
but let's just validate that so this is
pretty simple we're just gonna do a
continuity check and the purpose of this
is if you want to do a shunt mod you
could do it with liquid metal we've
never really advised that approach you
gain a bit from it in terms of lifting
the power target the shunt resistors and
this stuff most you probably know at
this point but these little things the
shunt resistors right there those are
used to control the cards power
consumption and if you short it to a
certain degree you can trick the card
into draw in a bit more power the
trouble is if you short it too directly
like with a short wire just bridging it
then what will happen is the card will
enter a safety mode go into 2d clocks
and run about 300 megahertz but you put
liquid metal on it which again we don't
necessarily advise the liquid metal will
we'll provide that that short you need
in order to draw a bit more power it's
just better ways to do it
there Bower and build we'd have both
talked about those if you're interested
for example on some cards you could
piggyback another chunk resistor on top
of it but there Roman de Brouwer did run
into trouble with that with this
generation so let's see resistance check
we're gonna check versus we have an EP
PCIe power pin out here on our mod mat
so it's a 6 pin that sort of tracking
against although eight pins really not
any different we have one of those there
too
it's just adds a sense and a ground line
that's what the plus two are for no 12
volt is added so we're gonna check the
you probably do this the easy way on the
back of the board
check the shunt resistor versus one of
the 12 volt lines is what we're
interested in so what we're gonna do
because this card just upside down and
we're measuring the back the top becomes
the bottom for the pin out typically if
you're measuring the top you kind of get
in there between the pins and you're
checking the ones on the inside line not
the outside line flip it over though
and what we're measuring is going to be
at the top instead so that we're taking
a 12 volt line here and if you look at
our mod Mak over here you can see the
PCIe 6 pin pin out it's the same as the
8 pin so it doesn't matter which one it
is 8 pin just adds a ground and a sense
pin and we're measuring against 12 volt
so on the card we take a 12 volt here
and measure that versus the shrunk
resistor and we should get continuity so
you see 0.1 ohms on the multimeter that
means we're continuous and that means
that this shunt resistor corresponds to
this power header so if you wanted to
short the shot on your 20 70 this would
be the one to do just to give me an
example of what you'd see if it's not
continuous imma probic the completely
unrelated pin and you'll get a very
different number that generally just
keeps climbing or fluctuating so those
would not be continuous which is what
you would see if you measured the wrong
shunt resistor and then this one if I
had the patience to do it and we had a
pin out that was easier to work with you
could measure this shunt resistor versus
the aligned 12 volt line on the PCIe
slot and you would see the same thing so
do not don't short that one that would
be bad you'll pour you'll they'll pull
too much power through your motherboard
and that would be an advisable so that's
what we have for the card
as for the vrm layout we'll have built
so I'd look at that but we've got six
power stages here and then these two
would be for the memory so it's got a
two phase memory VRM and that is using
what looks to be fdpc part so it's using
an FD g for one c e is the part or while
55 zero one eight five zero eight five
zero 185 G I really wish my eyes can
zoom in so yeah two phase memory vrm and
then we'll have build to look at the
rest but that is all the parts on the
card so that's the card it's really very
simple it's a small PCB we're not gonna
bother water cooling this one or liquid
cooling it because we kind of learned
about that with the 2080 Ti and with
this generation on like previous
generations thermal limitations aren't
really the main concern its power
limitations and if you open up
or some other monitoring application
while you're running this card
constantly the perv calf is going to be
a perfect cap reason will be power and
at 114 percent maximum offset when
overclocked you know you don't offset
the clock speeds and you just do the
power percent increase it's still
perfect app of power not even VL on this
one so it is very power limited but
we'll talk about the vrm separately and
the the cooler itself we would have
talked that we'll have talked about by
now in our reviews check the review for
cooler performance notes how this thing
does versus the vrn versus the GPU we
have all that stuff how EVGA stock paste
is versus aftermarket we've got all of
it
check the review for that as always you
can get a store like Aaron's axis Don
that supports directly find one of our
mod mats for example that was featured
in this video or will link the iFixit
kit below not in advertiser but we do
like the protec toolkit so check that
