motherboard for its PCI M PCIe potential
for video cards that's because we spent
$50 on eight video cards via the vision
tech mystery box so I don't think they
knew who I was when we ordered it I
don't I don't think they recognize the
address Patrick and I both ordered so we
sent some of the Patrick's house some
some to me that way we could mix it up
in case I tried to sneak something in
there based on the ordering the
destination what we end up with these
eight before that this video is brought
to you by the gigabyte z3 90 ARS master
motherboard which comes equipped with
one of the more powerful z3 90 V RMS for
heavier overclocks on the new 9th gen
Intel CPUs the ARS Master is also one of
the few motherboards with a real
heatsink this generation featuring a mix
of high surface area fins and looks
oriented cover blocks oh and it's also
got updated RDV illumination learn more
at the link below
so these eight are the Radeon HD we've
got a 64 50 in here we have a couple 54
fifties actually a two gigabyte note 512
megabyte we have a two two gigabyte 5450
sg4 8400 GS 512 megabyte a 2400 pro 256
megabyte and a Radeon X 1300 and 2600 XT
so we paid about five to ten dollars per
card depending on if it's PCIe PCI or
AGP and then decided after we saw what
what we received from the mystery bundle
to see if they're any good tested on
sort of semi modern tests vision deck
has done these before we ran an article
in 2014 when vision tech first did their
mystery box GPUs vision Tech's been
around long enough that they have
probably a warehouse full of old
inventory that they can't get rid of at
this point this is a good idea to move
through some of it now the usefulness of
the cards to you probably not that high
but if you just need a display out on an
old board I guess really specific then
maybe it's worth it either way though we
wanted to test it out and originally in
that 2014 article and we can show it on
the screen here the cards at the time
we're less they cost less than they did
for this round of cards you know they
say
the same one so previously the AGP cards
were a dollar the Radeon 2000 3000
series cards were $2.00 and then the
three the 4000 5000 series cards were
three dollars and for this round
visiontek increased the price to five
dollars for most of them and then ten
for a quote high-end or once high-end
anyway PCI Express card and what we
ended up with is what we have on the
table so these are not particularly
high-end devices we had to roll back our
testbench
and methodology a number of years but we
do have tests on them and then as noted
earlier we did two orders so one went to
me had my name on it the other one went
to Patrick had his name on it and it was
just to make sure that nothing
unrealistic slipped into the boxes in
case you were to order one we didn't
want to say you'd end up with an Rx or
r5 card or something like that as for
the cards available the 8400 GS and HD
6450 are the only two new options that
we received that were not offered in the
older and cheaper boxes from before
moreover at the time of working on the
content for this all the mystery GPUs
have disappeared from visiontext site
once again
so either we bought them all or
visiontext waiting for that HD 5450
market to really spring up the 5450 is a
crossfire capable GPU it's one of the
more interesting ones we got so getting
two of them meant that Patrick had a
chance to compete with my 6450 that I
got in an obviously identical cards or
at least identical amounts of VRAM would
be ideal but we did experiment with that
briefly using the - 2 gigabyte cards
together although it was against the
sort of the spirit of the competition
since one of them was mine and not
Patrick's but he stole it from me anyway
one of the two gigabyte 54 50s was a
terrible overclocker so we continued
with the mismatched pair instead
although we're mostly scouring to see
who got the better
mystery box of GPUs we did have to work
together on some of the tests so for one
of them we used identical we used the 54
50s that had higher overclocking
capabilities to just get a number on the
chart that had some chance of doing any
framerate that was reasonable and for
that we use the higher overclocking 54
50s in
fire the crossfire overclock used for
testing was a 700 megahertz core clock
up from about 650 and 720 5 megahertz
memory up from 500 megahertz not too bad
but that's about what was stable and
that was on both cards so they could
have been tuned individually but doing
them together was a bit easier for this
and frankly you're probably not going
out to buy these anyway
then finally the lower capacity 512
megabyte 5450 manage the memory clock of
900 megahertz without any visible
artifacting and all this was done
through Andy's control panel so the plan
then visiontek may not have stacked the
deck against one of us or the other but
one of us did get a better deal and
clearly highly scientific benchmarking
is the only way to know for sure which
selection of five-dollar decade-old GPUs
is superior and with that in mind the
first step was to figure out a
compatible test bench testing PCIe GPUs
is easy
we have shelves of motherboards and all
of them have PCIe slots dating back to
the beginnings of what we were doing
here we could plug in every single PCIe
GPU that we've ever had and to still
have slots left over PCI and AGP are a
different story the only motherboard
with PCI slots that we've used in normal
benchmarks lately is the asus p8 z68 - b
pro and that's the board we use for
testing our 2500 k and 2600 K Intel CPUs
this board wouldn't post with a PCI card
connected unfortunately and neither
would the nearly identical p8 P 67
deluxe that was sent into us by GN
discord moderator Liquid Paper it's
probably a solvable problem
but it wasn't worth spending yet more
time to figure it out so we began trying
more boards that were sent into the P o
box by viewers and we had a few options
here the EVGA 790i FTW was promising but
damage to the CPU socket meant that it
would constantly reset BIOS settings
preventing the selection of PCI cards
from the primary display the gigabyte G
am 7 5 0 sli - D s4 is an an - plus
board and therefore needed an old Athlon
64 chip socketed to apply a BIOS update
before it would support the Phenom 2 X 6
1090 T that we preferred for testing and
it also required a CMOS battery
replacement it's old it would boot and
then
using a drive with Windows 10
pre-installed but Windows 10 refused to
even attempt a clean install this led to
some increasingly desperate attempts to
boot into Windows with the Nvidia card
connected long enough just to try and
figure out its name which didn't work
the system worked fine using Windows 7
until we started swapping GPUs
afterwards the bios issues reappeared so
we had to move on from this one and it
didn't support crossfire support anyway
and could only fit four gigabytes of
ddr2 because we don't have any sticks a
larger than one gigabyte so after two or
three days of not getting much done with
these boards we gave up trying to be
creative with the viewer donated boards
and we dug out our 888 2x pro this Asus
board right here and this one is
something we use back when Andy was
sending us lots and lots of their ap is
to benchmark and review and I think we
ended up using the 7890 K APU for this
process for benchmarking and this board
finally did actually work so it took a
while but we found one that could run
PCI cards without any issues finally as
for the AGB cards we just didn't bother
we had a board here from a viewer but
just it by the time we got it anyway it
didn't work anymore
so the two cards that we got that were
AGP will not be in these charts they are
the Radeon X 1300 and the 2600 XT but
realistically if you bought one of those
for an actual use you're probably using
it just for display out on some old
system to get some files off or
something like that so PCI and PCI use
what we're testing for this we tried to
keep the benchmarks semi-modern while
staying within the hardware capabilities
but the PCI cards are not dx11 capable
and in fact had plenty of difficulty
just launching Windows at least Windows
10 we used 3d marks cloud gate and sky
diver benchmarks primarily with
Cinebench r15 and the OpenGL test for
extra testing Unigine heaven and for a
game Metro last light tests were run at
720p because Patrick's 512 megabyte HD
50 or 50 didn't seem to like running
1080p at all at least not in crossfire
and he wanted to be able to use
crossfire as an advantage because he's a
cheater
rest assured the GPUs were still the
bottleneck at that resolution the scores
recorded
are all the benchmark provided numbers
which is not the method we normally use
for scoring games like Metro last light
but it was hard enough just getting
these tests running at all without
adding third-party login software to the
mix and then there are plenty of
additional challenges too just because
it's all old hardware we run the
Cinebench OpenGL test for extra
verification during CPU testing although
those numbers don't make it to the
published reviews it's intended to be a
GPU rather than a CPU test but r15 was
released in 2013 and it take a pretty
low end GPU these days to bottleneck it
fortunately that's exactly what we have
the HD 64 50 Bostock and overclocked
handily tops the chart at 16 point 1 FPS
average this is the only one of our
tests that doesn't utilize crossfire
so the HD 5450 is all scored roughly the
same in all configurations but with
slight advantages from overclocking that
was led by the extra fast a 512 megabyte
card the 8400 GS brought up the rear
with an abysmal 3.5 3 FPS average but at
least it actually ran the test which the
HD 2400 Pro did not Cinebench runs a
validation pass before the OpenGL test
to make sure everything is working
properly and the HD 2400 Pro repeatedly
failed this validation pass so for the
start on this one we've got a mix of
cards in terms of whether Patrick's or
mine performed better although there is
some clear distinction and who got the
better value Metro is the only real game
on our list because it's one of the very
few games that we've tested in recent
memory that could actually run these
cards the benchmark was Ronda in dx11 at
720p with high quality which ruled out
the older non dx11 capable cards we ran
the entire benchmark pass and took the
provided numbers from the end rather
than using our usual method of using
frame logging software after all when
the benchmark average is under 10 FPS
the 0.1% lowers really don't seem that
important at the top of the charge is
the pair of overclocked crossfire 54 50s
with an average frame rate of eleven
point nine that might actually become
playable with some settings lowered but
impressively even the stock 54 50s in
crossfire beat the single overclocked 64
50 although it gained a good bit of
performance from overclocking the 512
megabyte 54 50 runs
an impressive 5.4 FPS average which ties
it with the 2 gigabyte HD 50 or 50 the
straight in that memory isn't the
limitation here but rather the core this
is further illustrated a second time
when our overclocked to the or 50s
effectively achieved the same 7 FPS
average within overclocking variants
between the two crossfire scaling versus
a single card wasn't impressive 83%
stock to stock it's rare to find that
kind of scaling in modern titles but
still happens sometimes Cloud Gate is a
testament for low-end systems like
laptops but it works for ancient GPUs as
well the two graphics tests are the
relevant ones here as it would take a
really awful GPO to bottleneck the
physics test instead of our 7890 K only
the HD 2400 Pro performed that poorly
again but this was also the only
graphics test that it could complete at
all the 8400 GS consistently crashed
after completing the first graphics test
at about 1 frame per second but it made
a valiant effort in the very least the
card still can achieve 60 frames per
minute which sounds impressive if you
zoned out and missed the change metric
of time there 2 minutes on the high end
of the chart the overclocked sat
crossfire cards dominate once again
managing an almost semi bearable 22
point 3 FPS average in the first
graphics test in 18.4 in the second the
overclocked 64 50 scored almost as high
as the stock crossfire 54 50s roughly in
line with the scaling seen in the Metro
test skydiver is a real test in the
second to last one here in the sense
that this one was made with desktops in
mind rather than laptops and ap use
there's also no pure physics test here
instead making do with a combined test
that was absolutely GPU limited with
these cards anyway the gradients of
scores looks a little smoother than in
cloud strike at a glance anyway but
that's only because the lowest end GPU
is could run cloud strike
whereas sky diver is beyond their
capabilities and they were removed from
the test as a result crossfire scaling
is again about 2x in this benchmark with
the worst card operated at 5.7 FPS
average and functionally tied with an
error margins to the HD 5450 512
megabyte card this again illustrates
that the extra v round capacity really
doesn't help in these benchmarks Unigine
heaven is the last of the tests and it
largely confirms what the others already
showed the overclocked crossfire cards
were the best scoring
by far and the stock to gigabyte 5450
lags ever so slightly behind the stock
512 megabyte one the crossfire 54 50s
ended up at 326 points when overclocked
leading stock crossfire performance by
28% the stock 54 50s in crossfire led
the fastest single card 5450 stock score
of 133 by 92% posted nearly perfect
scaling all right so now I'm joined by
Patrick he did all the testing on this
stuff and encouraged me to buy the cards
so we spent 50 bucks on this Patrick
what what's your conclusion I mean some
of these you know the display outs are
DVI and VGA and I think s-video
yes so usefulness is limited but would
you would you would you do this would
you actually spend $5.00 well it's it's
a tricky question because would I spend
$5.00 on one of these if I just needed
an HDMI out or just something to like
slap into a test system really quick yes
but their mystery cards so there's no
guarantee of what you're gonna get it's
probably gonna be in HD 5450
statistically speaking
yes statistically speaking we got what
three about four old three of them three
and 16450 and we paid more for one of
them on the other I think yeah so we
paid five five dollars for one of the 54
52 gigabyte cards and 10 for the other
one there so clearly at visiontext
there's no actual I don't think they
actually have bins of like this is five
and this is $10 I think it's like here's
a bin of garbage and just put any of
them in the box and ship it it's
probably true and they also took down
the mystery box offers after we bought
these so we may have just bought the
whole bin of trash eyes on them I there
have to be more I feel like there had
more probably because they did this
before like in 2014 they they did this
people didn't buy enough room and they
were the same cards then yeah but which
which was the one that you liked for
it's cooler so these are the a JP cards
here we didn't test either of these I
there's no reason to think that there
working there probably working fine we
just don't have any AGP boards around
but this one is heavier which makes it
better yeah and it has a picture of a
lady on it and this one doesn't so I'm
declaring this one the winner yes and
there's at least 10 polygons in her face
yes so this is clearly capable of very
high resolution high poly rendering also
it has a backplate on though which is
better than some r-tx cards presently
but oh and it's got their own pads on it
too if we're just judging by a cool
Aurora though I think this gives it a
run for its money yeah that's great
really good cool all right guys sitting
at a desk very prophetic sign you know
it's profession right I had forgotten
yes so I don't know I think I think
we're probably in the in the not worth
it category for the most part if you
don't know what you're gonna get it's
not worth it because you could always
end up with if you buy one of the PCI
cards something like this which
coincidentally happen to have a cable
that fits this but it's not a normal DB
il would even know what card this was
for a long time yeah
and yeah is that the Nvidia card yes
that is the one the one Nvidia card
which didn't have its name anywhere and
you you just tried to boot into an OS to
get it to tell us what it was yeah so
fun though fun experiment for a couple
bucks I guess if you're in the mood to
throw a few dollars away and I don't
know it's basically a loot crate IRL is
what it is
except then you can't like you can't
wear it and fortnight I think that's
what people do and crates and you can't
resell it on eBay you can't resell it on
eBay yeah yes oh well you could for
definitely less than you paid for yes so
probably not worth it fun experiment
though if you see anything similar to
this out there alert us to it you can
post a comment below with any
suggestions content ideas you have in
this vein and we'd be happy to look into
it because it's it's in the least
affordable content so 50 bucks down the
drain but you get to see what the
mystery was and and it's
now it'll probably back around Christmas
again because that's what visiontek
tends to do since I don't think they saw
much of anything at this point other
than the mystery stuff and maybe some
all these Jesus speakers well it's true
