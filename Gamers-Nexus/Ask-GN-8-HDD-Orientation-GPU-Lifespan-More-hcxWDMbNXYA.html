donna and we're back for another asks GN
episode some really good questions this
week and a couple that were pretty
detailed and i'm not getting to hear but
i replied to at least one of them
because i want to do a full feature
article video everything on that
question and particularly i want to do
more than just breeze through it on an
asked GN episode but let's go through
some of the good questions for this week
and of course if i didn't get yours
please post it again below and i'll see
what i can do about the next episode the
first one is from dink see who says i
have a short question if you could cover
it is there any risk to having hard
drives placed in a vertical position any
known issues of skips failures reading
data that you have come across this is
actually a really good question and i'm
a fan of this question because
vertically mounting hard drives if you
think about it seems like it could
potentially be a gun spec so a hard
drive in a traditional use case you kind
of think of it as sitting like this and
a desktop rig or something like that and
a hard drive as you all likely know has
moving parts it has spinning platters
some of I have three some of 5:01
and those are little metal discs that
spin very rapidly in a circle so
normally 5400 revolutions per minute or
7,200 or something like that and the
traditional point of failure for hard
drives is the very way that they operate
it's the mechanical method it's the
mechanism through which they spin so
because you have a spinning platter at
several thousand rpm and you have a
header which effectively acts like a
header on like a record player you have
a header that's trying to read a very
precise point on that platter just like
with a compact disc although that uses
lasers you're reaching a very precise
rein in the disc around the around the
center so it requires a lot of accuracy
it requires high speed requires
precision to make sure you're not
missing the data and hitting the wrong
point of the drive which causes all
kinds of errors reading errors check
errors stuff like that drivers fail a
lot they often do the click of death
death excuse me as it is known and the
click of death starts happening when the
drive age
and things like the the platter will
start wobbling at its rotation or the
header will just really not move quick
enough to access the data so hard drives
are very interesting mechanically and
technologically because of the way they
operate I'm I'm very interested in the
topic we can do more on that later but
answering this question specifically if
you look at the specs from all the major
manufacturers including some of the
defunct ones like Mac Store WD Mac's or
Samsung HGST and Hitachi which has been
consumed or HGST has been consumed by WD
but all these manufacturers state very
clearly that their drives will function
across all six axes so you don't mounted
in any direction it's got six axis
functionality and if the drive will not
care so you would think that gravity
would have an impact on the vertical
revolution of a disk because it's it's
just it's applying more force in ways
that would not be applied when it's like
this so you would think that's a problem
but all the manufacturers insist that it
is not in their spec sheets and these
are even stretching to enterprise drives
so this is an important point if you
think about enterprise outside of the
consumer world's hard drive racks for
servers are normally mounted so the
drives are vertical and that's for space
reasons they can fit a lot more devices
that way they can build blades and more
fine-tuned configurations for their
clients so the drives kind of have to
work vertically and all the specs sheet
spec sheets say it's not a problem there
is one potential concern but it's
probably not a concern for any of us as
gamers or system builders or enthusiasts
and one concern is that you will
generate more heat if it's mounted
vertically but I'm talking a very very
small amount of extra heat and hard
drives don't get too hot to begin with
and that is because the platters
dissipate heat best when they're mounted
horizontally heat rises from the surface
and the the enclosure for the hard drive
for the platters is designed in a way
that allows the heat to escape more
readily through the big metal plates on
the top and get out that way so that is
the one
tiny concern but for our audience for
you guys for me personally that is it's
really not something that's worth us
worrying about unless you're in some
sort of enterprise configuration then
you really should not be talking to to
YouTube about that you should be
consulting you know experts for
multi-million dollar enterprise
configurations but so that is the the
deal with that
next question let's go IO IO actually I
remember this name previously
let's go iOS says hey Steve on the topic
of degradation talking about PSU
degradation for the previous episode how
well do older graphics cards hold up
over time have you noticed any
particular trends one way or another
with a certain model and then goes on to
say I think the long lifespan of the gtx
8800 and AMD 7970 we're I guess he's
saying we're good while the 580 seems
left by the wayside in comparison what
traits lead to a lawn GPU service life
another good question I would agree that
the 580 has not aged well I actually had
one and used it for a number of years
and it's really not holding up that well
at this point which it's kind of
surprising because actually in this
example you're talking about the 8800 I
had one of those as well and that held
up crazy well so a couple things here
when we're talking about how things hold
up there's there's different things that
can mean with fps that is going to be
largely dictated by the environment of
the game development atmosphere
currently so when the 8800 came out it
was the top of its class the only game
really pushing it was Crysis 1 and this
is I don't remember for his 2007-2008
somewhere in that area maybe it's not as
late as 2009 7 or 8 and games did not
really get a whole lot more intensive
after Crysis 1 for quite a while so the
thing we're talking about with FPS
metrics in terms of degradation is more
dependent on the game space and the
drivers space than it is on the
architecture of the GPU because the
architecture of the GPU is always going
to be limited by some technological fab
process or similar engineering challenge
but the way game engines utilize those
cards the way API is you
those cards with dx12 and back then it
would have been probably the x10 maybe
going into 11 eventually that that
changes how long they will last in terms
of FPS so and that's going to happen
again with the x12 coming up but then we
look at other topics outside of fps and
those are going to be things like
thermals so how well does the GPU itself
hold up under lawn service life as
you're asking and the answer to that is
going to depend on how the heatsink is
designed so you want to look at things
like the compound used talked about this
in a recent video certain types of
compound will decay over time and some
metal compounds will really don't
necessarily hold up too well over time
you want something like ceramic or some
non conductive compound for long service
life and then other things like the
thermal pads used to hold the heatsink
to the V RMS to the B Ram and all of
those very critical power management or
memory management items if you don't
have a high end thermal pad on there and
a high end heatsink design or when I say
high end I really I just mean quality
then yeah it's going to age faster and
the way it ages fast is from thermals so
if if the GPU is running at 90 Celsius
as one of the counters pointed out in
the video or in the reply to the
question here it's running at 90 Celsius
for its whole life it's not going to
have a long life and you can replace the
compound the heatsink all that stuff but
it's still getting damaged over time and
silicon does actually like heat a little
bit but not that much heat so you'll
want to target a lower temperature as
low as possible you know kind of build
the get a case that's cooler build the
system around it they even go with the
closed-loop AI OCLC or something on
there but if the if the thermals are
lower it'll it'll last forever
I mean it's not going to really have a
problem because the thing that happens
with thermals is as it gets hotter the
compound cracks the heat pads lift up
off the surface and get some separation
so then they're not doing anything
anymore and then the the heatsink has no
contact with the BRM ER to be
and another item to look at is bearing
so fan bearings will wear out over time
and a double ball bearing setup for
example has a pretty long service life
than only 40 50 thousand hours something
like that
so that's a number of years of 24/7 and
then you look at things like the driver
support going back to FPS driver support
matters because it dictates you know how
well does the card hold up for new games
you look at and videos recent 700 series
drivers against their 900 series drivers
the 700 series video cards sort of fell
off the cliff as the 900 series is
ramping up and that's because driver
support was less emphasized or just not
done correctly so that's something to
look at as well as part of why the 580
is now basically useless and 800 because
they're just not supported and tuned for
anymore so those are all different
things to consider but at the end of the
day it is thermals I'm not going to
really harp on one brand or another here
but some thermal designs for GPUs are
better than others that's all the AI B's
the Adhan Board partners actually do is
thermal design so you want to buy one
that's a good design silence does matter
but don't don't go full silence if
you're going to run this a long service
life because you want it to actually
stay cool as much as possible next
question Howard Thompson who is also
posted before asks Steve can a budget
motherboard eg H 81 limit GPU
overclocking versus what pairing with a
higher-end board the Z 97 with cleaner
power delivery might be capable of I
wonder because the GPU can pull 75 Watts
through the PCIe slot so and so's I'll
of the channel say thank you so this is
a good question as many of you know the
H series chipsets will limit CPU
overclocking and actually to the point
that you can't even do it depending on
which generation we're talking so that
is actually a thing that happens and
they also normally have weaker VRMs it's
fewer phases lower grade chokes or caps
not all of them but a lot of them and
this limits the the efficacy of the
power management
so that's why you don't want to
overclock and why you can't overclock on
those chipsets now with GPU overclocking
what you care about is going to be the
BRM on the GPU not necessarily the
motherboard so the motherboard does
matter it still manages power delivery
to the GPU and if you look at high-end
of other boards you'll see that some of
them are built for GPU overclock and so
an example would be we've got an X 99
EVGA board in the lab I think it's a
classified board or maybe the FTW so
it's a high-end x99 board and that has
an extra pin out on the board for the
GPU so we can plug in other six power
pins from the PCIe header from the power
supply into the board and that gets
managed and delivered to the GPU if
you're doing any kind of extreme
overclock some boards do this through
molex 4 pin connectors so yes the board
can impact GPU overclocking but we're
talking at the sort of extreme class
here you're doing serious overclocking
then you will want that extra power but
a lot of GPUs you'll need to custom tune
the BIOS to even get to the point where
you can accept the power to prove any
difference so boards do impact it but
not terribly so if you have an HID one
board or whatever something similar h1
10 whatever one of those then the
limitation is going to be primarily by
the GPUs vrm itself and your power
supplies grade of cleanliness for the
power delivered and you can probably get
a couple hundred megahertz out no
problem it will get hotter though so the
the chipset which is located beneath the
GPU if it's not really cooled adequately
on a lower on board the chips I can
start overheating that will cause IO
problems and stuff like that so
hopefully that gives sort of an answer
to the question the I guess the short
form is that yes a motherboard can
impact GPU overclocking but not to a
crazy extent it just it well it can but
we're talking extreme overclockers here
not kind of the average user who just
wants 200 extra mega Hertz next question
hi Steve is from ill to xbox hi Steve
really like me to ask GM videos they're
very informed
I have a question about improving air
flow reducing the noise in my system and
then the question goes on for for a good
bit they're talking about different
items in the scenario so reducing noise
the best thing to do is fans first so
you can just getting a liquid cooler
first of all it does not make your
system quieter depends on the liquid
cooler a lot of radiator fans are pretty
loud so the first thing to look out is
that for is pwm fans and those are
indicated by a four pin header on the
fan cable and that needs to be plugged
into a four pin header on the
motherboard pwm fans can be controlled
depending on need by thermals that the
CPU often dictates so if you're in a low
thermal environment it'll run them at a
lower rpm they're quieter that way so
that's one thing that can help a lot now
not all fans are made equal either so if
you have a bunch of 120-millimeter fans
it's important to look at the bearing
type some bearings are louder than
others some age more poorly than others
sleeve bearings for example do not age
very well ball bearings age pretty darn
well but towards the end of their life
and we're talking four to 50,000 hours
here toward the end of their life they
start squealing from the the grease
drying up so that's another thing to
look out for if you have an older
systems is what kind of bearings in
there and if you got get some kind of
fluid dynamic or hydro bearing those
should be quieter in terms of the
bearing noise but you still need to make
sure the rpm is lower and rpm is really
what dictates a lot of the noise as is
the blade design the blade design will
impact the turbulence in terms of the
air being pushed into the system how
much is getting trapped between the
blades on the on the intake and let's
see other than that probably one of the
major things to do would be increased
fan size where possible and again not
all are made equal but the larger the
fan the slower it can spin and still
move the same amount of air as a smaller
fan so you'll want to eliminate like
eighty millimeter fans in SFF build you
want to eliminate 120 where possible and
the next thing to do is get some kind of
vibration damping set up so that you can
get like
Rober sort of glue vibration absorption
systems that you just attach to your
hard drives and to fans between the
normally the rear fan and the chassis
that will reduce vibrational noise you
can also get a foam that is applied to
the paneling the side panels a lot of
cases shipped with this now you can buy
separately from modding sites as well
and it's an adhesive and you have a side
panel sticky adhesive to it and that
will absorb block or deflect depending
on how it's designed a certain amount of
noise not a ton it's better to go the
fan route first and look for vibrational
noises and then probably look in to see
LCS or better air coolers and that's the
biggest item I think that I haven't
mentioned yet is your CPU cooler matters
that makes a lot of noise so sod coolers
are pretty loud if you want a quieter
setup you could get something like the
the be quiet coolers true to their name
they are very quiet we use them on our
test bench because they run basically
100% of time behind me or my shoulder so
those are dead quiet and they'll
modulate the CPU fan based on load which
is really good because you don't want it
spinning full speed all the time it'll
spin down and even almost stop sometimes
though it's not necessary because the
giant aluminum heatsink can do the job
just fine when it idle GPUs you buy a
GPU like the Strix
or the EVGA ACX cooler stuff like that
the MSI gaming coolers those will spin
down to zero rpm when they're under 30
watts or less load so dota or League can
generate a small enough load that your
fans only need to turn on for the GPU
that makes it quieter the power supply
after all these items if it's still too
noisy start looking at the power supply
because those fans make noise too and a
bigger fan is better in this instance
because you can spin slower so they're
normally 135 milliliters or 120
depending on what you're looking at
that's another place to look Corsair
makes pretty darn quiet power supplies
so does be quiet NZXT s can be a little
louder but that's all sort of
generalizations hopefully that helps
let's do one more here very quickly and
I'll address this one probably in a
a upcoming full feature articles so
we'll get back to this later but
question from Street guru says would you
suggest an 860 K with an r9 390 or an i5
4460 with an r9 380 so $70 plus $300 860
+ 390 versus 180 + $200 I 5 + 380 which
one do you think is better relatively
the same cost cost this is pretty cool
so this is a good question because it is
actually a real scenario where if we're
building that's something we think about
it kind of comes down to personal
preference I really like building with a
stronger base platform like the CPU the
motherboard and the power supply because
things like the GPU and RAM are very
easily upgraded later so for this
specific scenario I would go with the
i-5 and the 380 because I would rather
have a high-end board and CPU and just
swap the GPU maybe a year from now and I
have more money or something like that
so the my thinking behind this it's a
couple things one is Windows really does
not like it when you change the
motherboard and CPU if you're working on
keys then sometimes it won't let you you
have to call in and get yet another one
which might result will often do but
that is a consideration that can
increase your cost they hit in $100 if
you have to reinstall the OS but mostly
it's just that if I don't want to
reinstall my my host setup in a year
just to upgrade then I would probably
want a base platform that stays the same
static so the CPU in the motherboard
stay the same the next thing is GPUs are
really easy to upgrade you don't have to
do a lot you just pull it out and put a
new one in with CPU you might have to
change the motherboard in the case of
the 860 K it's a pretty good chance
you're changing the other board because
FM 2 plus only gets you so far right now
and that's another cost and then with
the the CPUs the actual performance you
really don't want a bottleneck something
like a 390 which will happen on an 8 60
K you don't want to bottleneck that GPU
for a whole year whatever long you're
waiting to upgrade it's just kind of a
wasted expense then so those are the
is to consider I am a fan of building a
stronger base platform and upgrading the
more modular items later if that answers
that but we'll we'll run some benchmarks
and do a thin on this because it's a fun
question I do have to get hardware from
AMD though and that is sometimes hard to
do so that's all for this video thanks
for watching and submitting your
questions post more below huge thanks to
those of you who are patreon backers I
think they're called patrons or
patchen's or whatever you want to how
you want to pronounce it and I think
we're up to maybe thirty now it's it's
getting there it's really tremendously
supportive and I am appreciative as is
the rest of team so that's all for this
time check back for more content
throughout the week check the website
for some good stuff on laptops some new
news items and things like that I'm
currently watching that the focus box
follow my head around on the camera
anyway that's all for this time I will
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
