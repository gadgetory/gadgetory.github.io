Nexus Donette and today we're looking at
a lot of SATA cables a whole lot of them
so I posted a video about a year ago
saying that there were fake
HDMI to VGA cables and I called him fake
because they were passive they did not
have an active converter in them so they
could not convert the signal from a
digital signal to an analog signal in
this video I commented that SATA 3
branded cables and of SATA 2 branded
cables were also fake the interface SATA
tube where's the SATA 3 very different
it's about two times different in fact
in transferee but the cables are the
same the spec has not changed for data
throughput on these cables since their
inception effectively and the only thing
that's changed is a little Clippy thing
on the end that was added more recently
in the updated st. expect to make it
lock into the drive so some people
disagreed with us on that statement that
SATA 3 cables so called air quotes were
the same as SATA 2 cables in performance
and I decided to finally take some time
and back up my statements so we tested
each of these cables I'm not gonna count
them right now but there's a lot of them
tested all of them they range from 48
cents to 12 dollars for a cable and
spoiler alert there's no difference at
all between the twelve dollar cables and
the $0.48 cables so finally vindicated
or I guess I should say finally proof
has been provided to substantiate my
claims and this is nothing
groundbreaking this has been known for a
very long time other media outlets have
done the same tests if you look at our
test there's less than half a percent
error and solve these results 532
megabytes vs. 531 or 531 versus 533 less
than half a percent 0.37% difference in
those results that difference comes from
things like host processes in the
background or inconsistency with the
software itself the benchmark they're
not 100% consistent it's not indicative
of performance differences with the
cables it's just margin of error green
tab so hopefully that provides some
validation to those comments you do not
need to spend $12 on a SATA 3 cable in
fact you can spend about 48 cents how a
cable and get the same performance the
only difference is going to be on things
that like the
here at the end which is a new santa
spec and all that does is make your
drive more secure there might be some
build quality differences maybe you get
more connection cycles out of a three
dollar cable versus a forty cent cable
but twelve dollars on a cable is insane
for SATA you do not need to spend that
there will be zero noticeable difference
to you as a user there will be zero
notice will build quality difference
versus a five or three dollar cable and
the only thing that might be different
is sleeping people like BitFenix will
sleeve the cable custom completely
different story at that point you're
buying aesthetics so that is the
performance analyzed for SATA cables I
hope that answers some questions please
comment below if you have other items
miss whatever that you'd like us to
debunk on the channel and I will do so I
will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
