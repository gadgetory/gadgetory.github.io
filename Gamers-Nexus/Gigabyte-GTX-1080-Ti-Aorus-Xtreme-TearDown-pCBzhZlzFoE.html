before the review of this card we just
reviewed the MSI 1080 TI gaming X this
is the gigabyte GTX 10 80 TI horas
extreme gaming video card sort of taking
this one apart it is huge it's the
biggest one that we've gotten so far I
think it's two and a half slots or
something to that effect and uses a
three fan cooling design that's somewhat
interesting we'll be taking it apart and
then reviewing it shortly thereafter
before getting to that this video is
brought to you by the current bundle on
the GTX 1060 and DT X 1080 video cards
where you can get Ghost Recon wildlands
or for honor at checkout this comes
alongside new MSRP is for the GTX 10 80
series cards now down to $500 you can
learn more at the link in the
description below so going over the
basics the three fan design here I'm
sure they have a name for it if someone
has some kind of marketing name but it
is a windforce cooler the interesting
thing with the fans you look at the side
to their normal axial fans the middle
one is an axial fan as well except this
blade is actually cut kinda in half and
the reason it's cut in half is because
these other blades come so close to them
that if it weren't cut like that they
would collide so theoretically this
allows gigabytes get an extra fan on
there without taking up more width of
the the card without making it wider
taking up more space now how effective
is that we'll see not really 100% sure
it's worth it but we'll find out in
testing so other features of note
there's a copper piece here as part of
the backplate this is isolated from the
rest of the backplate and connects to
the rear side of the GPU down there via
thermal pad so theoretically that helps
transfer some of the heat off there the
hottest area tends to be around this
spot where the vrm the MOSFETs and the
inductors are but we'll go ahead and
give the backplate it has just like we
did with the MSI gaming X although that
was published only in the article if
you're curious to see how much or if the
gaming X backplate effects that card
will do the same for this one see if
this affects this card that normally
back plates are primarily for structural
support for something that's large it
makes a lot of sense you've got a
massive cooler with a huge dual set of a
Lou
them heat sinks and then the baseplate
in the cold plate so you want some kind
of support here to keep it straight and
prevent sagging the fact that they've
added this to it means that they are
also trying to do something thermally
and we'll look at that
other than this there's some LED stuff
going on here as well and LEDs and the
cross bars on the front so in terms of
the card beyond that we've got a set of
five visible heat pipes that are
probably more towards the inside of the
card five visible heat pipes that look
to be six maybe eight millimeters this
might be eight and and then looking down
the center of the card I can see that
they've got what looked to be two or
five millimeter they're all pads in most
places which are pretty large so we'll
go ahead and start taking it apart and
look at all that stuff for this it looks
like it's all Philips and part of this
disassembly process is so that we can
get thermocouples on it to read the set
and and other temperatures PCB back
plate or backside all that stuff
how to peel all the pads off that is a
ton of cables okay so this one goes here
is more from my information than anyone
elses that goes there this one goes
there this one goes there and we've got
one unused connection here and they are
using the lower down one that's more
from my info for later all right
and so the backplate has these thins
these are where the actual Phillips head
screws were and then the other ones just
you don't do anything with of you as
soon as these are out you can just pry
the card off the plate off the base
plate which is pretty nice that's not
only how easy it is then once we get
under there you can see that these
screws are where the rest of the back
plate is being held on so we have to
remember to put these back in during the
reassembly process they're on the slides
horizontally of the GPU one bottom
center or bottom Center between these
two one near the power and those not
spring retained and the screw size is
the same this screw actually is I think
exactly the same yeah as the rest of
what was used in the back plate so that
makes organization easier that should be
it for the back plate we might not have
to remove the cover like expansion cover
over there okay all right
power cable for LEDs lots of cables on
this card I think was a $750 card okay I
just taped it in there I mean why not if
it works
so there's your LED pad I suppose and
we've diffuser anyway with LEDs in it
that's your
now for the thermal solution this you
can just pull off as well back Center
where the capacitors are there's no pad
around the sides of the thermal pad that
will conduct heat away and then
theoretically expose it to the outside
now you would need a fan directed at
this or at least case fans to actually
get the thing to do anything otherwise
just going to saturate and there's no
dissipation you need to the patient as
part of the equation to cool something
when you're conducting so these thermal
pads are contacting with the vram
backside right here
there's no vram backside coverage
anywhere else so it's just here and then
this line is making contact for this
capacitor bank it's on the back of the
card actually and this batter pad is
making contact it looks like yeah where
the MOSFETs are attached on the other
side right here so let's flip this over
oh and then we've got a hole in the
middle for their LEDs so that would
probably be the hottest spot and I will
it matter
probably not MOSFETs can get very high
in temperature and they don't really
care Oh also there's a front HDMI on
this board which is useful if you are
trying to do a VR pass-through I guess
but that's all that's there for so
pretty pretty densely packed board we've
got the chokes down the center anything
of note well first of all going over the
power headers again some of these are
for LEDs so there's LEDs on the front in
the back and the top of the card this is
three of those and then the others are
for the fan power and let's just see if
the fans if it's a three cables or
either one because if it's or two rather
because if they've individually
separated the cables we could actually
disconnect the middle one and see if it
does anything of
note in the noise and temperature
Department there's the middle one okay
so it's pretty hard to see but down this
channel there the middle fan is
connected to a pass through or extender
cable extension and that's going out to
one of these other ones it's probably
probably this one but that's going out
of the side so we could actually
disconnect some of the fans if we wanted
to out to try that and see if it works
the way I would like it to work now in
terms of the cooling solution beyond the
fans what we've got is a massive copper
cold plate for the GPU and for the vram
so this quite clearly contacts the GPU
and then these make contact with the
vram modules this one is missing the
same V Ram modules every other 1080 TI
we've opened so far same physical
position and then on this so we've got
vram contact theorem conflict the your
own contact all thanks to the same
copper cold plate and then that's
getting cooled by the heat pipes for the
heat pipes you can see that there are
five really small ones in there pretty
interesting so we got five there a
bigger one still not a six mil though
bigger one that's routed into this
aluminum block and that terminates in
here so there's the terminating I'm just
down there or you can see it's crimped
and then this heat pipe routes around
goes it looks like goes under the plate
with the vram then potentially back in
so that's what we've got for the cooling
solution there are four screws here
which I'm not it looks like those help
secure it to the aluminum thin stack and
then cut these like massive bolts on
here to this thing is really built up in
in a big way in terms of hardware
there's even holding on now let's let's
mess around with this and see what
happens so four screws here
thinking this might come loose and this
by the way this design we've talked
about it a few times now but it's
basically because they are deciding to
cool the GPU and the vram that's kind of
a new thing the last year or so it's
gotten popular that means your GPU core
temperature will be higher than if they
only cooled the GPU core if you're
cooling multiple things of the same
plate and the temperatures get so like
if we took this and we physically cut
that off the GPU core temperature would
look lower in software but you lose the
via Ram cooling efficiency in theory so
it's it's a good trade normally an extra
couple group degrees doesn't really kill
you on the GPU core but having that
extra cooling on the vram is nice these
are eight millimeters there's another
one in there so I'm not really sure
we're going to get anywhere with this
but we can try it just because I haven't
seen anyone do this on a video card
cooler ever I'm sure it's been done I
haven't like been in the industry so
many years nine years or so but this is
new to me so we're going to mess with it
where are we mounted oh here's the other
one there's not a big bolt down there oh
I think I got it
so another screw hidden down here
there's some of the most industrial
assembly of a card I've seen any time
lately oh it's kind of real pain that's
not going to be fun to reassemble
so notice Li because the cables and the
routing of the cables all right so the
thing I was curious about what the big
bolts going through here with the what
are these eight mill nuts on the end
this is just like it looks like a
another spacer type thing that will
actually fall off if you let it so not
that I want you to be doing this but be
aware of that you can see that kind of
dents and damage here that's from where
the cables are routed the center channel
is a bit the same density same thin
density it's just got this bar down the
center which we've seen several times in
other cards but I'm trying to figure out
what exactly is going on with these
bolts running through and might just be
structural support like we could take we
try and take those out I would need a an
l-shaped allen wrench to do it it's very
sharp
there's something I can do that and on
this reach
I really think that okay so this is all
this is doing having looked at it out
these bolts running through if you were
to loosen this and pull it out which
good luck with that you'd have to get
this one off too would you loosen them
and remove them I believe this aluminum
thin stack would separate from the
copper plate which makes sense because
they're not going to manufacture this
then all I want its the copper plate
will be made separately from the
aluminum heatsink
so that's how that's held together I
believe Hansa just five small heat pipes
in here the other one there we've got
another set of like three or we've got
five more total coming out of this side
which is the vram saw or vrm sight
excuse me so you've erm and inductors
and all those components are cooled by
this directly as indicated by the
thermal pads contact and you can see the
indents contacting the components
there's a little rubber bumper here and
that more or less sums up the cooling
solution we'll have to see how it works
in testing okay so these things right
here the sets these are fairchild six
eight two three C's which are part of
their it's a driver I see and it
integrates to fetes that'd probably be
your highside and low-side and then it's
also got a diode in there and what's a
ultimately a six by six package so
that's the fairchild dual FET or it's a
driver IC with two that's high and low
side I believe they'll joins the expert
on that for the channel but that's what
I'm starting to learn here and then
other than that I think we've pretty
much gone over the card so full review
is forthcoming we'll have the usual
overclocking testing have a lot of
thermal testing to do on this one not
100% sure how much we'll do in the first
run for the review might revisit it
shortly after for more button the very
least we'll be testing the BRM
temperature as we've done in the past so
that will be comparable to some of the
other vrm temperatures house we've done
like the 1080 TI gaming x from msi do
the GPU temperature
our frequency stability all that stuff
