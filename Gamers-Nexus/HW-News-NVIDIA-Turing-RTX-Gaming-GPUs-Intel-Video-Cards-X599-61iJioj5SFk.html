hardware news episode this one we have
actually some pretty big news Intel hot
on the heels of Nvidia talking about
their RT X graphics cards Intel has
teased their upcoming video cards and by
upcoming I mean a couple of years from
now but they wanted to hop on the
bandwagon and make sure they got that in
there early so in tiles got some
announcements that are potentially
somewhat significant going forward
anyway case labs
sadly closes its doors in the past week
it's been announced by case labs that
the company will be going under and
Nvidia of course dominating the news
cycle with RT X and with its touring
architecture coming up soon on as a
follow-on to the Volta architecture that
we talked up previously with our Titan
VIII before that this video is brought
to you by Thermal Grizzlies high-end
thermal paste and liquid metal thermal
Grizzlies cryo knot is an affordable
high quality thermal compound that
doesn't face some of the aging
limitations of other pastes on the
market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted test by a tube at the link
in the description below
quick GN news first as always you can go
to store documents access dotnet to pick
up one of our mod mats the last couple
are still in stock before we're in a
waiting period for the next round to
come in so if you've wanted one they're
still in stock and shipping now if you
want to grab one and also the blue the
cobalt color GN beer glass is with the
gold trim are back in stock now too so
Nvidia obviously huge news for the past
week and more coming as NVIDIA has
announced now formally that there will
be some Gamescom discussions in about a
week in Germany and we will be there so
Gamescom is where we'll be meeting up
with a couple of other people in the
industry as well but NVIDIA has got its
event spanning a couple of days there
and there should be some sort of gaming
celebration I think is what they're
calling it but basically it's going to
be probably some kind of touring related
architecture discussion or at least
video card teasing announcement because
at this point we've seen it from sea
graph on the professional side so it
follows that the game inside would be
next
so at SIGGRAPH 2018 Nvidia announced a
formal announcement of their touring GPU
architecture and they viewed their new
Quadro r-tx cards the Torino
architecture highlights a number of new
features like hybrid rendering and video
is calling it and real-time rate racing
RT and tensor cores are part of this
it's not really news at this point that
Nvidia is looking at real-time rate
racing but this formalizes that it's
Nvidia's next big push the Titan V and
Volta architecture did have a
significant foothold for real-time rate
race and it's something we've talked
about before where with help from things
like denoising and with a relatively
limited amount of rays it is possible to
do real-time rate racing we're not there
yet in the gaming world it'll happen
eventually but it seems like NVIDIA
wants to make that happen sooner than
later and video has been pushing for
this now for several years originally
Tony Tomasi in a 2012 or 2013
presentation stated that they were
looking at something like 2015 for
real-time rate racing missed the window
a bit but maybe it'll happen with the
help of touring so the tensor cores that
we saw in volt in the Titan VIII can
actually be leveraged for real-time rate
race and which makes them a bit more
interesting it's not just the machine
learning and deep learning that we
previously thought it might be they do
have more uses even within the world of
gaming something that until the actual
r-tx not like the geforce r-tx version
but the rate racing software
announcements from GDC is kind of when
we learned that tens of course might
actually have some use outside of things
like deep learning and machine learning
where it was originally targeted
additional news on the touring front
Nvidia is pulling over FP 16 support
from Volta architecture taurine is more
or less a stem from Volta architecture
not a big surprise there and also
they've got some int 4 and into 8
support enabled with the new Taurean
architecture not sure how much that's
going to impact our audience but we'll
find out soon I suppose this will be
more useful for non gaming applications
immediately than in gaming applications
pro visualization will certainly get use
out of all the features announced at
SIGGRAPH as that is a probe is
conference
so gaming comes next but the stream
multi-process have been reworked
architecture as well we don't have full
details or block diagram on the sm
layout just yet but typically the really
high-end like GP 100 type cards have had
a different SM layout than the gaming
cards anyway so it'll be something where
we might need two different diagrams one
for gaming one for the high end
depending on what Nvidia has changed
specifically in the SM layout and part
of Nvidia's focus is to speed up BBH
processing here this was big for
SIGGRAPH for that audience so for many
three manipulation programs blender
included like the blender GPU test we've
done in the past they will use bounding
volume hierarchies or bvh for object
storage and taurine specifically is
trying to speed up and accelerate bvh as
a basically container for objects within
that software so that's a big push along
with ray-tracing
and then nvidia is targeting a 25 X
increase in rate race casting over
Pascal just if you want a point of
comparison versus previous non volta
architectures certain will be a
successor to volta we've previously
detailed that volta the Titan V had a
huge push for asynchronous compute
support for the level api support and in
a way that was reflected in games like
Sniper Elite 4 and other DX 12 or vulcan
games where it was properly executed not
just a wrapper so we already confirmed
publicly that you can expect continued
improvements in the front of async
compute something that NVIDIA hasn't
been as loud about previously with
Pascal but they've been making that
moves for it and additionally alongside
this announcement and video rolled out
their first touring based GPUs formerly
the workstation class Quadro RT x-series
not only do the new cards highlight
obviously the torre√≥n architecture but
they also feature our TX branding rather
than just straight Quadro or GTX
branding so this alludes to Nvidia's
focus on real-time ray tracing and
dedication to it being the big thing for
this generation GD r6 memory
unsurprisingly is here as well with the
new cards we've already kind of detailed
that several months ago at this point
and the cards are RT x eight thousand
six thousand and five thousand and in
terms of coup de coeur account if you
want to call them that
it goes from 4608 on the 8006
to 3072 on the 5000 tents of course 576
for 8 and 6000 384 for 5000 and then the
memories the big difference here 48
gigabytes of g6 for the r-tx 8000 24 gig
for the 6000 and 16 for the r-tx 5000
again these are Provost cards not gaming
clearly if for no other reason than
looking at the B round capacity they are
quite expensive just in case you're
curious it's 10 grand us for the are TX
8000 it's about $6,300 us for the six
thousand and twenty three hundred for
the are TX five thousand and memory bus
with is 380 four bits for the larger 2
and 256 for the smaller the Nvidia is
using 14 gigabit per second memory on
this so the first g6 round we know that
hynek's micron and samsung have all been
making GDR 6 for a while now Hynek
started its mass production around july
or there abouts maybe June and micron
for a while Samson for a while now and
14 to 16 Giga bits is not unreasonable
to hit 14 is going to be more common
original or immediately and then 16
later on as the company's iterate on
their process and improve their yields
and things like that so that's what
we're looking at for Nvidia's big news
will get back to Nvidia in a moment but
first case labs closes so this is
certainly sad news the PC community case
Labs has been a a very high-end brand
for case manufacturing and if you've
ever thought about getting a gigantic
box for open-loop cooling maybe with
tons of drive base support stuff like
that that might last you a decade case
labs has been one of the foremost
companies to provide that experience and
it shows too because a lot of their
cases have been in use and deployed for
a long time at this point and they've
been in the 500 plus dollar range for
many of the really high-end ones so case
labs announced a few things for this
closing they said that it looks like one
of their major accounts has gone default
or abandoned them or something they were
basically dropped as a client and case
labs as a result has lost a significant
part of their revenue stream case Labs
also cites material price increases of
upwards of 80 percent as a result of
what they claim to be the
current tariffs that have been discussed
lately in other hardware news episodes
and so by losing the large account and
facing the material price increases
particularly in metals case Labs was
forced to close business and it looks
like there was almost a deal to save the
company but it does not look like that
one through at this time if you had an
open order for case labs they say that
they're trying to fulfill all orders the
parts orders are more likely to be
fulfilled than complete case orders at
this point as they were largely handmade
or individually ordered for the orders
that came in so no guarantee that people
with open full case orders will get them
we don't know the status on how refunds
are going to work but follow up with
case labs if you have any open orders
because at this point you might not get
it next one Nvidia so back to this with
filing a trademark for GeForce r-tx
specifically for GeForce r-tx rumors
were swirling for a while that the new
GPUs could skew the long-standing gtx
branding and with our TX announcements
at SIGGRAPH those stopped being rumors
and started being reality after SIGGRAPH
it looks like with the gamescom
announcement we might see our TX
branding continued for geforce cards
nvidia has filed its trademarks and over
at the US Patent and Trademark Office
and video filed for touring quadrille
our TX and GeForce our TX as of now two
of those taurine and quadra r TX have
already been unveiled so we can expect
clearly what the next one would be and
Gamescom makes the most sense for that
as that's where NVIDIA has already
publicly indicated their gaming event I
believe they call it a gaming
celebration event which is probably
under signing to debate and video teases
the next GeForce lineups this is also in
the news after announcing taurine and
the new Turin based quad row cards and
Vidya teased new geforce lineups with a
short video subsequently redditors over
at our and video dissected the video and
found some Easter eggs alluding to what
appears to be a GeForce r-tx 2080
announcement based on that we might
finally know the answer to whether it
would be eleven eighty or twenty 80
unless Nvidia's just messing around with
all of us at this point but also rumor
for this one Intel's ex 599 chipset will
power the
new skylake ex architectures and h EDT
or HDTV plus cpus coming out soon
intel has been working on a new h EDT
platform in response to an DS threader
for two and rumors suggest that it could
coincide with a new ex 599 chipset while
details are currently scarce information
indicates that the chipset will use LGA
3647 sockets offer hexa channel memory
support 12 dim sockets and featured
chips based on skylake ax silicon and
this might coincide with a 28 core
processor but we're not clear at this
time it was sort of originally shown as
a processor that five gigahertz it was
overclocked clearly we had a problem
with some of the presentation of that
but it we're not clear on what the
status of that processor is it might
have been going towards cascade lake
eventually but was on Scylla cache
originally one was shown as far as we
understand it we're pretty confident in
that so x5 9 and I'm not clear on what
the final processor choices will be for
that but it does look like 28 core makes
sense for for that platform and then
finally Intel graphics cards are
actually real so in a move that seemed
out of the Kris hook and Raja Kaduri
playbook Intel followed suit on Nvidia's
announcement to note that they too would
have GPUs someday and this by the way
Chris hook and Roger Kaduri both now
work at Intel so makes sense that those
play books would come into play for
Intel here Intel's pushing for a 2020
launch on its GPUs we're not clear yet
on whether those will be consumer
focused or for professional users but
it's a couple years away anyway Intel's
pushing that it's IGP will be quote set
free for its future d GPU options and
that was really the start in the end of
their marketing stick for the new GP is
not much to show at this point there's
some blue smoke some shrouded graphics
cards likely old Larrabee stock and a
teased future for Intel in graphics
which actually all of the lack of
information aside Intel coming into
graphics especially for the gaming
market would be great because we could
use some more competition there it's
been a duopoly for a while and NVIDIA
has the lion's share of the market
clearly so some other competition would
be good if Intel can pull it together
and do something
just probe is but we'll see what they do
and then finally hardware sales will
link a couple below there was a 1080 SC
with a 750 watt g3 modular power supply
for 490 bucks if it's still on sale
it'll be linked below monitors have been
not bad lately graphics cards at this
point because we know our TX or whatever
it's called is coming up
clearly the Pascal cards will be
considered obsolete soon and they're
probably end-of-life and a lot of
instances not being made anymore or will
soon stop being made so if you see those
on sale might be worth picking up but
just make sure it's actually a pretty
good sale otherwise it's worth waiting a
bit and seeing what comes out in the
future for the gaming cards that's it
for this time as always go to store doc
guarantees access net to pick up some of
our products like the GN beer glasses or
the shirts that we've had like the Graf
logo shirt was restocked recently you
