that we're at GDC 2016 at Nvidia's booth
and now we're looking at g-force now
which is a game streaming service I'm
joined by Chad Cooper from Nvidia to
talk about that he's a build engineer
working on GeForce now before we get to
this coverage all of our GDC 2016
coverage is brought to you by raw fury
is it gone or platformer game what you
see on the screen now Chad so what's the
top level overview of GeForce now we
know there was this grid thing before is
this grid just with a new name or what's
going on and this is a latest version of
it right now it's available on NVIDIA
shield branded devices it's currently
$7.99 a month you get access to a huge
library of games and then we also sell
titles as well and what's unique about
that is if you buy the title you can
play it immediately so you don't have to
worry about downloading it or driver
updates or patches or anything like that
you launch it it works and then on the
back end we also email you the license
key to the game so you can download on
your PC if you want so you get both
options there what about so what about
input latency things like that with with
regard to when I'm playing the game I'm
streaming it I push a button on the
controller how long does it take to
respond on the screen input latency we
try to keep it down to be on console
level and we've that's been a big
challenge at Nvidia and what our
engineers have done is they put a
hardware encoder
on the actual GPU so as soon as those
images are loaded up into the frame
buffer they're then compressed and
encoded immediately on the GPU in about
2 to 5 milliseconds depending on the
resolution and the frame rate that we're
going to be sending through it and then
on the client side we have that same
encoding technology there and it's
decoding it real quick so that's what
makes it extremely snappy so that's
that's kind of how we solved it and how
about a millisecond target for input
latency specifically target wise we try
to keep it on par with consoles just
really a low latency target as fast as
possible we deploy data centers around
the globe to also assist with this and
we do work with ISPs to ensure that
people get the latency less experience
and then server-side so there's the as
they used to be called grid but I guess
the g4 is now servers are those set up
in different locations around the
country or how are you setting those up
correct right now we have them a few
players around the US and we also have
them around the world as well so in data
centers like Singapore in Tokyo we also
have them there and in Europe in Ireland
so it's it's a global right now and it's
available does the server basically do
all the graphics processing all the
computing and then just ship a package
sort of video to the computer to the
client is that how it works
that's exactly how it works so what we
do is we put our high-end Tesla great
GPUs in the cloud and then we create a
virtual machine that's dedicated to that
end user
they've got dedicated CPU cores RAM even
provision I ops so it ensures that they
have the best gaming experience possible
from the cloud and then other than that
we only support shill brand devices
because of our decoder so we cover it
from end to end to ensure that you get
the best experience possible trade shows
as as we know maybe the viewers don't
necessarily know but trade shows have
historically terrible internet it's
really hard to talk outside the show
what do you use here to work with
GeForce now and you're demoing yeah for
this event what we do is we piggyback
off some of the technology that we've
been working on on the engineering side
so a lot of our engineers and architects
have idea is to deploy single rack units
and small data centers so it's a
proof-of-concept so we've done is we've
taken that concept and we shrunk it down
into essentially like a monster gaming
PC and so that's what we brought to the
booth so we have a whole virtual
environment or a whole data center tons
of VMs running all the networking all
the beyonds going all at once and it's
streaming to these end devices now for
our game saves and our entitlement and
all that stuff it piggy backs off of AWS
still so it goes back to our datacenters
that release out for AWS just for that
and then those user saves come down to
this this local server and then you're
able to play your game where you left
off even if you logged in with your own
account here so it's kind of neat that
is cool what's the GPU set up inside the
GPU that we have in this config is our M
5000 so basically a GM 204 is Maxwell
class so
it's equivalent to a gtx 980 effectively
so that's that's what you're getting in
this demo to the rig
because it's pretty powerful yeah yeah
that's pretty powerful that you
mentioned bison staying with AWS with
for when you communicate to AWS that's
one other question I have so most these
games now obviously have some sort of
DRM or licensing how do you guys work
with that do you do you talk to the
publishers or what's the deal there yeah
we have a great relationship with the
publishers so we've had that for years
working with them and so each publisher
we handle it differently and so it's
really kind of up to them we are
releasing a grid SDK or a cloud gaming
gets SDK for the developers to use for
onboarding games to the cloud to make
things easier and we can provide I'll
provide you more information I'll send
you a link so cool so more information
linked in the description below if
you're curious we've got an article on
this and then of course there's some
pretty big game works and news that came
out yesterday
we've got a full 2000 plus weird article
detailing all that if you're curious how
it works especially with things like
voxel accelerated ambient occlusion and
all that so links to the description
below thank you for watching we'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
