that we're at GDC 2016 at Nvidia's booth
and now we're looking at g4s now which
is a game streaming service i'm joined
by chad cooper from nvidia to talk about
that he's a bill to engineer working on
g-force now before we get to this
coverage all of our GDC 2016 coverage is
brought to you by raw fury is it gone or
platformer game what you see on the
screen now Chad so what's the top level
overview of g-force now we know there
was this grid thing before is this grid
just with a new name or what's going on
this is a latest version of it right now
it's available on NVIDIA shield granted
devices it's currently seven ninety-nine
a month you get access to a huge library
of games and then we also sell titles as
well and what's unique about that is if
you buy the title you can play it
immediately so you don't have to worry
about downloading it or driver updates
or patches or anything like that you
launched it it works and then on the
back end we also email you the license
key to the game so you can download on
your PC if you want so you get both
options there what about so what about
input late and see things like that with
with regard to what I'm playing the game
I'm streaming it I push a button on the
controller how long does it take to
respond on the screen input latency we
try to keep it down to be on console
level and we've that's been a big
challenge at Nvidia and what our
engineers have done is they put a
hardware encoder on the actual GPU so as
soon as those images are loaded up into
the frame buffer there then compress and
encoded immediately on the GPU in about
two to five milliseconds depending on
the resolution and the frame rate that
we're going to be sending through it and
then on the client side we have that
same encoding technology there it's
decoding it real quick so that's what
makes it extremely snappy so that's
that's kind of how we solved it and how
about a millisecond target for input
latency specifically target wise we try
to keep it on par with consoles just
really low latency target as fast as
possible we deploy data centers around
the globe to also assist with this and
we do work with ISPs to ensure that
people get the latency less experience
and then server side so there's the a
USB called grid but i guess the g4s now
servers are those set up in different
locations around the country or how are
you setting those up correct right now
we have them viewable areas around the
u.s. and we also have them around the
world as well so in data centers like
Singapore in Tokyo we also have them
there and in Europe in Ireland so its
global right now and it's available does
the server basically do all the graphics
processing all the computing and then
just ship a package sort of video to the
computer to the client is that how it
works that's exactly how it works so
what we do is we put our high-end Tesla
great GPUs in the cloud and then we
create a virtual machine that's
dedicated to that end user they've got
dedicated cpu cores Ram even provision I
ops so it ensures that they have the
best gaming experience possible from the
cloud and then other than that we only
support shield brand devices because of
our decoder so we cover it from end to
end to ensure that you get the best
experience possible trade shows as as we
know maybe the viewers don't necessarily
know but trade shows have historically
terrible internet it's really hard to
talk outside the show what do you use
here to work with GeForce now and you're
demoing yeah for this event what we do
is we piggyback off some of the
technology that we've been working on on
the engineering side so a lot of our
engineers and architects have ideas to
deploy single rack units and small data
centers so it's a proof of concept so
we've done is we've taken that concept
and we shrunk it down into essentially
like a monster gaming PC and so that's
what we brought to the boot so we have
our whole virtual environment or hold
data center tons of VMs running all the
networking all the villains going all at
once and it's streaming to these end
devices now for our game saves and our
entitlement and all that stuff it piggy
backs off of AWS still so it goes back
to our datacenters that release out for
AWS just for that and then those users
say it's come down to this this local
server and then you're able to play your
game where you left off even if you
logged in with your own account here so
it's kind of neat that is cool what's
the GPU set up inside the GPU that we
have in this config is our m5000 so
basically a GM 204 it's maxwell class
so it's equivalent to a gtx 980
effectively so that's that's what you're
getting in this demo to the rig cuz it's
pretty powerful yeah yeah it's pretty
powerful that you mentioned bison
staying with AWS with for when you
communicate to AWS that's one other
question I have so most these games now
obviously have some sort of DRM or
licensing how do you guys work with that
do you do you talk to the publishers or
what's the deal there yeah we have a
great relationship with the publishers
we've had that for years working with
them and so each publisher we handle it
differently and so it's really kind of
up to them we are releasing a grid SDK
or a cloud gaming gets SDK for the
developers to use for onboarding games
to the cloud to make things easier we
can provide I'll provide you more
information I'll send you a link so
people cool so more information linked
in the description below if you're
curious we've got an article on this and
then of course there's some pretty big
game works news that came out yesterday
we've got a full two thousand plus word
article detailing all that if you're
curious how it works especially with
things like voxel accelerated ambient
occlusion and all that so link to the
description below thank you for watching
we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
