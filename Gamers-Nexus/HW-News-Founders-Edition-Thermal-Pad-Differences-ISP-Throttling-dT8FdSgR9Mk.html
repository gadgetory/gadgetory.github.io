hardware news recap for the last week
lots of r-tx stuff going on not sure if
this video will go live before after the
review is probably before but we have an
RT x factory overclock lockdown to
discuss aren t ax assembly differences
that we found and you'll see in our
previous to tear down videos of the RT x
cards founders edition cards gigabytes
advertising using our content without
permission that was an interesting and
unexpected one and then Intel report of
the outsourcing some of its 40 nanometer
production to tsmc before that this
video is brought to you by Thermal
Grizzlies high-end thermal paste and
liquid metal thermal Grizzlies cryo not
is an affordable high quality thermal
compound that doesn't face some of the
aging limitations of other pastes on the
market cryo not has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted test by a tube at the link
in the description below
so first up here our TX assembly
differences we have the teardown video
where we go through the PCB primarily
and then the one where we took apart the
cooler up separately and hopefully we
can have some b-roll that in this
segment so what we found there a few
different things that weren't mentioned
in that video one of them the thermal
pads difference so the there are canvas
throne pads similar to the Fuji poly
pads on our 2080 founders Edition card
we should have footage of it versus the
normal pads on our 2080 ti founders
Edition card so theoretically the 28 es
in this instance should actually be the
better of the two and I thought it
really ultimately matters a whole lot
we're not sure why they're different
especially why they're different
skewing better towards the lower end
card but most likely it's because
anybody is using multiple sources to get
these cards made and so it's either
because these were made before the
entered mass production or they just
didn't have the supply and switch
thermal pad suppliers randomly between
the cards which is going to skew their
own results a bit so we're not really
quite sure what to make of that we've
reached out and asked Nvidia why how to
received an answer as of filming this
and then additionally there's an RGB LED
controller on it
we noticed when profile II probably in
that top thing off the part that was
glued on that's his r-tx 2080 TI is
glued on like an apple product when we
pried that off there's an RGB LED
controller under it and the cable can
support RGB LEDs and yet the logo only
outputs green so a little little weird
it seems like and video don't want to
jump on that RGB bandwagon but for
whatever reason they've probably
artificially disabled RGB LEDs from what
we can tell because we know it's green
because if you look at the press footage
from their own press event all the stuff
that's publicly now you can see the
cards running and it's green LEDs and it
does not change color as far as we're
aware but it has the capability to so
we're not sure why they didn't enable
that and finally this one's extremely
small the 4 millimeter hex screws that
go under the backplate which again we
have shots of that too are black on the
28 efe versus a silver color on the 2080
TI fe so it doesn't matter but they're
different that's the three main
differences we saw between them that we
can talk about today but moving on our T
X factory overclocking potentially
locked down as discovered by tech power
of the developers of the extremely
useful GPC utility if you don't use it
we highly recommend you download it it
is an excellent overclocking application
for gesture doesn't actually do the O
scene but it monitors all the thermals
and statistics of your cards so tech
powerup develops GPZ and in doing their
development for updates to RTX they
discovered that Nvidia created multiple
device IDs for new touring GPUs and
working with this information and their
own industry sources techpowerup was
able to confirm that Nvidia intends to
recreate its gtx 1070 TI scenario where
inboard partners were barred from making
overclocking models of their gtx 1070 T
eyes and had to stick to a fixed clock
for all models of that card so we
recently showed the dies a few r-tx 20
series GPUs in our tear downs and you'll
notice that the name includes things
like k1 which that specific strain is an
identifier of which memory module is
missing as far as we understand now they
also contain a signifier of either 300
or 400
some other suffix and that's what
techpowerup found as a difference
between factory overclocked and
completely locked down chips for board
partners techpowerup confirmed the
following quote when a board partner
uses a320 and GPU variants factory
overclocking is forbidden only the more
expensive - 30 - a variants are meant
for this scenario or - 300 a probably
both can be overclocked manually by the
user but it's likely that the
overclocking potential on the lower bin
won't be as high as on the higher rated
chips separate device IDs could also
prevent consumers from buying the
cheapest card with reference clocks and
flashing it with BIOS from a faster
factory overclocked variant of that card
think buying an MSI gaming card and
flashing it with the bios of a gaming X
so to clarify this doesn't look like an
end-user limitation you'll still be able
to overclock the card but it's a
limitation of what the board partners
are allowed to do for factory
overclocking which means that the chip
is probably lower quality so you
probably won't be able to overclock it
as high if you're doing it as a user and
again to clarify it's the 300 ID versus
300 a one could argue that this is a
good move with disallowing the board
partners from differentiating themselves
by clocks but doing so would require you
to say that well it ensures a certain
level of chip quality for overclocking
cards and that this certain level of
quality would allow you to sustain
higher overclocks then leave our been
chips it does not increase Nvidia's
yields as far as we're aware because
they'd be selling those chips anyway
it's just that you typically rely on
board partners to pretest and sort them
for performance as EVGA does with their
kingpin cards or their gaming black
cards at the lower end on the other hand
this is a restriction on board partners
that isn't necessary we should trust
board partners to do their own testing
and if they fail to do so let the users
find out from other media or other users
and stop buying from that partner if
this locked clock variant exists in
reality and it probably does Nvidia is
slowly chipping away at the advantages
that board partners provide for this
generation there's almost certainly
reality that Nvidia is charging more for
these on mock GPUs which are sold to
board partners for factory overclocking
and we'll link that article below if you
want to read it and our show notes you
should also download gpu-z if you don't
have it but kind of
concerning its it's not necessarily a
big deal it's just that if nvidia is
creating more 1070 TI scenarios where
all the cards are the same even for the
clocks the only difference is the cooler
most people don't overclock so that's
not something we really like but we'll
see what they do in theory they're
selling higher end ones but that might
be what's partly driving up the price
because here's the problem and video is
now whether they say it or not and they
won't they're competing with their own
board partners because their founders
Edition card is a dual axial card it's
also one of the really it's supposed to
be a higher end card and it's sold at
$100 over official MSRP but in reality
if you're selling to board partners
these chips that are specially unlocked
for factory overclocking how much does
that boost their cost does that put them
above the founders Edition cost and then
they also have to deal with the cooler
custom PCB all these other things so
it's not on unrealistic that board
partners end up above Effie pricing and
Effie has a dual axial cooler so it the
limit the the value they provide is now
limited and that's a bit of a concern
because Nvidia this entire this whole
launch is behaving very much like Apple
and that's something we're concerned
about and video makes a good product
their game products are largely
uncontested the prices on the 10 series
are great right now for the value so we
like the present lineup of higher-end
products barring things like the 1063
gigabyte and the 1030 stuff like that
that you already know about the cards do
fine it's a good product but the company
is behaving in a way that's a little bit
concerning considering its rough 70 to
80 percent market share in the gaming
market because they have a lot of poll
and seeing that poll exercised in the
ways it has been with taurine is
disconcerting today I'm moving on
gigabyte using our content as an
advertisement against well actually
without even asking us or telling us and
I have YouTube premium so I didn't see
it so some of you reported to us that
you saw our gigabyte r-tx 2080 hands-on
from pax run as an advertisement on
YouTube before content made by our our
peers in the space like
the other technique series so we'd never
authorized the use of this content I'm
glad you all emails us or tweeted at us
thank you for doing so we filmed this
content as part of our regular show
reporting it was a news report from pax
from the show floor so we were confused
why it appeared as an ad that wasn't
what it was and after reaching out to
gigabyte we found out that the company
used our independently produced video
which was entirely our content as an
advertisement without our permission or
even telling us and we demanded of
course if that be terminated it was
fortunately relatively quickly so we've
heard that this has become a common
problem with YouTube reviewers mkbhd had
this issue with I believe his oneplus
review where the company used his review
as an ad and it does boost the views
significantly but it doesn't benefit any
of us does you're not watching that
sense ads within the video because it's
already an Adsense ad so we don't gain
anything from that other than
potentially it's harnessed reputation
because now his oneplus review looks
like a paid advertisement and the same
is true for anyone else who'd ends up in
that situation I think Luke from Linus
tech tips had that problem too in the
past so it's a problem and it carries a
few issues a few of them are for example
it makes the reviewer like us in this
case look like we're endorsing a product
makes us look like we're endorsing the
Gigabyte r-tx 20/80 that we showed at
pax because they're using it as an ad
when in fact we've never used the card
and have no idea if it's any good so we
don't endorse it it's I'm completely
neutral towards it I don't know if it's
good or bad and then further it makes it
look like we were paid for that video
but in reality we're at PAX to work on a
panel and to show reporting which is
what that was so that's definitely not
the image that is accurate or the one we
want Thank You gigabyte for creating it
for us and then further gigabyte could
easily film their own advertisement this
is the weird thing here so they have the
card they have more time with the card
they could have a studio with a card we
were on a show floor and spent 10
minutes shooting it so they can make a
better ad than our 5 minute long video
which contains some criticisms of the
product and an ad for another company
baked into the video bit odd so then you
have to start asking why would they run
our content as an ad if they can make a
better one and the answer is it's
because as the same for mkbhd it's
because they know that reviewers have
credibility and carry weight and people
will see that reviewer and think that
they endorse the product and that's
incorrect in this situation we don't
know if it's any good or not so the
company leveraged our position in the
market to try and promote their own
product one which we presently haven't
used which is a huge violation of any
sort of trust with us and it also can
tarnish the reputation of the media
outlets mkbhd us Luke anyone else so we
want to be clear we do not endorse the
r-tx 28 gigabyte cards and have never
used them so we don't know if they're
any good gigabyte did provide a public
apology after the incident and the
letter reads gigabyte would like to
issue a formal apology to gamers Nexus 4
recently promoting one of their videos
as a pre-roll ad on YouTube gigabyte was
wrong for using content from gamers
Nexus without consent and I've put
measures in place to ensure this kind of
situation is not repeated in the future
to be clear the video was not sponsored
by gigabyte nor should their coverage be
misconstrued as an endorsement of
gigabytes product or brand gigabyte has
great respect for the work gamers Nexus
does to bring accurate and unbiased
information to the enthusiast community
so first of all Thank You gigabyte and
well that was internally who pushed for
this pushed for us to get an apology of
some kind we appreciate that some of the
people there obviously took this issue
extremely seriously
our contact primarily and pushed to
resolve it so thank you to the
individuals doing that and the company
seems to understand it now so that's
good too but if anyone sees our content
or really any youtubers content run as a
pre-roll ad in the future be advised
that we might not be aware it's an ad
and a lot of us as content creators have
YouTube premium just so we understand
how that works so if you see it please
let us know via Twitter and it's almost
certain that it's not an authorized use
of the content so we'll get it taken
down if you see it that way but thanks
for pointing it out to us issues
completely resolved with gigabyte they
took it all down they were pretty
understanding once we explained the
problem so we're good there
but I did want to clarify for everyone
who reported the issue next one intel is
attempting to mitigate an expected
supply constraint of 49 we see
use as reported by digit times and digit
times also suggest that Intel is looking
to offload some of their lower end lower
margin products like the HP 10 chipset
to TSMC by outsourcing the HD 10 chipset
and several other 300 series chipsets in
quotes
this would allow Intel its precious fab
capacity for higher margin products
which would no doubt be server grade
data center chips as digit times notes
TSMC is already under contract for some
of Intel's SOC and FPGA design so they
would be a natural first choice as they
already have experience supporting
Intel's designs onto their nodes
additionally there is speculation that
CEC 2019 or California Energy Commission
regulations could have some bearing on
the move to TSM C as California is set
to have at stringent new power
regulations for PCs and other
electronics in saying that until may
find it appropriate to lean on an
external foundries lower power node
rather than refining their own amidst a
supply crisis and report by semi
accurate the company purportedly
obtained documents from HP e to
illuminate the effects of Intel's 40
nanometers shortage one such effect
being a potential increase in sales of
an these epic CPUs the documents are
internal from HPE and detail mitigation
strategies were dealing with Intel being
unable to meet demand for their Xeon
skylake SP CPUs the most eye-catching
among these strategies and probably the
most practical is to quote offer
alternatives these alternatives would be
the AMD epoch based platforms the server
ones last year AMD and Hewlett Packard
Enterprise announced the ProLiant gen 10
series of servers based on AMD epoch
these are the exact models HPE would be
recommending in lieu of models using the
Intel Xeon SP processors HPE as well as
other enterprise players may be looking
to AMD in the last half of this year to
mitigate loss in sales while Intel
struggles to meet demand and for another
brushstroke in the painting of Intel's
misfortunes and supplying 14 nanometer
based chips is Intel based laptop
shortages although they have an upside
of potentially lowering DRAM prices
there could be a silver lining here so
for consumers if you're not buying into
all based laptops out anyway there's a
report from DRAM exchange which is a
leading memory price
website that shows OMS are suffering
from insufficient supply of intell's new
whiskey Lake processors yet another high
demand part and 14 nanometer is
exacerbating Intel's struggle to meet
the unanticipated 40 nanometer demand
without 10 nanometers support to back it
up so this constricted supply is set to
disrupt a laptop production but it could
lower DRAM prices and these have been
exorbitantly high for about two years
now even with price fixing
investigations going on in China and
elsewhere and there's a gap between
production and sales here with a
decrease in laptop shipments there will
be a hopefully an abundance of DRAM
supply in the market which could
potentially drive down prices for fourth
quarter 2018 it just depends on whether
that supply comes to us in the
enthusiast space or not the next one a
new study concludes that ISPs are
increasing throttling so why is this in
the news is this this is news apparently
I have species are increasing throttling
so research from Northeastern University
confirms what is really not surprising
which is that ISPs are throttling
network traffic the data which is
subject to of an exhaustive study set
for published in 2019 highlights the
trend of arbitrary throttling by many US
cellular providers primarily throttling
when network traffic is at its peak is
one thing but throttling just because is
kind of a different thing with no
apparent rationale either as the report
indicates what's more is the throttling
tends to be aimed at video streaming
services like YouTube and Netflix and
even Amazon ISPs are cherry-picking at
which network traffic to throttle which
is known as differentiation a violation
of the previous net neutrality framework
struck down this year the study finds
that throttling is happening
discriminately 24/7 even when the
network appears to be uncongested often
the big ISPs are the focal point of
these issues AT&amp;amp;T Verizon the defect
from charter but this study shows that
smaller lesser-known ISPs are happy to
follow suit Hue's network systems a
subsidiary of Hewes Communications is
actually a satellite provider
and according to the data they're guilty
of throttling Netflix to a mirror 0.7
megabits per second there's no reason to
believe that rampant throttling won't
extend to wired networks either there
were already many cases of that just
before net neutrality was gutted and
many fear here that ISP behavior will go
unchecked post net neutrality including
us because we already deal with evil
ISPs and they're getting eviler as it
were so next one 52 percent of us gamers
play on PC according to eat our eeda are
the one of the research companies that
we've reported on in the past shows a
20-18 gamer segmentation report finding
that 67 percent of Americans play video
games seems kind of low to be honest and
52 percent of those gamers playing on PC
additionally the report also finds that
42 percent of gamers play on a console
or designated device and of course some
of these numbers can overlap because
it's you could actually play on multiple
things not just PC believe it or not and
Mobile is still King here accounting for
60% of the gamers of the people who
identified as gamers and the report not
a big surprise there the free version of
the report doesn't dive into how many
gamers play across multiple devices ie
how many PC players play on console or
mobile but it should be in the paid
report if you're a market researcher and
want that data the numbers are
interesting though if only to rebuke the
misnomer that PC gaming is dead as it's
been reported for the last decade now
and it serves as fodder for the pc vs
consoles or so feel free to use that
link as you violently attack other
people for enjoying something that you
think is bad next one up and video will
introduce a scanner for automatic over
clocks we talked about this with Tom
Peterson in our interview with him but
it's a new scanner that's actually the
old scanner that's been rebuilt so this
is a one-click overclocking utility it
launches a scanning program it checks a
bunch of voltage and frequencies Klotz a
curve for it and theoretically builds a
pretty good overclock that is based on
performance characteristics so you might
have different clocks on frequencies
depending on the type of load the
application is producing which is good
because if you typically work with you
work with any kind of overclock and you
try and do it quickly you'll find that
it's stable and one advocate
not the other so in theory scanners
supposed to do that better but in the
past it crashed a lot especially the
EVGA version of scanner but they're
trying to build a new one for twenty
series cards this is still one-click
automatic overclocking so as always
it might not well let's be honest it's
not going to do what manual overclocking
would do so if you enjoy manual
overclocking just keep doing that but if
you just want better performance and you
don't want to put any effort into it
baby it's worth while it probably is
worthwhile we'll test it and we'll let
you know it was decent in the past it's
just that manual always did better but
automatics not bad these days finally
hardware sales lonely when we lined up
for now is and these threader for 1920
axes been marked down pretty
substantially from launch and will
probably stay there at this point
because a thread Ripper too so if you
want a CPU and you don't need it to be
the newest and the best it's a decent
price we'll link that below if you want
it otherwise there's always show notes
in the description below or in the top
comment and you go to store document
