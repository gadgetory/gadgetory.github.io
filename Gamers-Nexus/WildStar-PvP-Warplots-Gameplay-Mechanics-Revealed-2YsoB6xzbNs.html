nexus net and i'm excited to be talking
to you about the MMORPG wildstar from
carbine studios and their war plots pvp
combat or plots is a 40 vs 40 pvp base
battle mode that features upgradeable
and destructible structures and some
amazing npc combat integration so i'll
talk about how a team gets set up how
the war plot is constructed all the
upgradeable structures and some tactical
items and how the game generally plays
out so to form your team or war party
you can have up to 40 members everyone's
got to be level 15 or higher if you
don't have 40 people you can also
recruit mercenaries who get matched to
your team's skill you can actually have
80 people on your roster but only 40 of
those can be in battle when you go to
set up the base you'll have your basic
foundations and structures like ramps
and stairs force fields and two
generators in the back that the enemy
can destroy to win but that's just one
way to win the other is draining all of
the war parties energy meter which I'll
go over a little later creating the warp
lot happens in a stage that's separate
from the battle so you don't have to
rush this part the war plots actually
floating in mid-air and you can invite
others to come in and help you build the
war plot and strategize freely before
you enter that separate battle stage the
war plot is seven spots called socket so
you can populate with plugs these are
kind of like armories or the research
labs in the RTS as you might have played
like Starcraft I'll go over them one by
one here so first of all you've gotta
travel plug to shoot players from the
base to the battlefield kind of like the
man cannon in Halo then you've got small
plugs that are offensive and defensive
plugs for armor mitigation health
bonuses for your deployables like
turrets and handcrafted items traps
things like that also there can be
barriers and defense grids for the map
armed with lasers and obstacles and
things like that the third type of plug
is the large plug and there are two
varieties that they come to mind here so
there
a guard plug that summons NPC guards of
different types and abilities to your
base and you can upgrade their health
and damage and then there are also
hazard plugs that create full 3d zones
the deal out damage to the enemy but not
to you actually you can camp out in the
hazard zone in your hazmat suit to
easily finish off players the last plug
is the super weapon and as cool as the
multiple rocket launcher and the
gargantuan orbital lasers come off to me
I'm going to cut right to the chase and
talk about the boss owner modification
you can actually go to a dungeon or out
to a raid and pick up a boss token that
lets you summon your boss during battle
it's actually a 20-man boss so that
means that the smaller bosses from the
game have been upgraded specifically for
war plots and have they may have
different abilities and attacks that you
haven't seen before so your boss by
default guards one of your generators
but you can spend your match resources
and actually teleport your boss into the
other team's base for a boss on boss
battle so I mentioned earlier that you
can win a match by destroying the
enemy's two generators or by depleting
all of their energy you deplete the
other teams energy by player kills boss
kills and destroying all those plugs
that i mentioned actually the you
destroy the smaller units around them
that are called structure units now to
be able to upgrade your plugs fire your
super weapons and summon reinforcements
guards you'll need to win the neutral
ground of the battle and control what
are called nano pack nodes every nano
pack node that your team controls will
generate a stacking damage vulnerability
debuff to the enemy's generators but if
you can control some of the nodes and
the neutral ground you can upgrade your
plugs and fire your super weapons sooner
alright so that's a quick overview of
warp lots to learn more about these
different gameplay elements in detail
check out our extended war plots

watching everybody and for putting up
