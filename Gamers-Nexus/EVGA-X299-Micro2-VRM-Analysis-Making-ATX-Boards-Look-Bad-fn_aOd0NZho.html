going to be taking a look at the PCB on
the EVGA x2 99 micro 2 motherboard which
we have right here so it's an m-80 X X
$2.99 motherboard and this is the second
revision of EVGA x' micro ATX
motherboard and as far as i'm the i'm
aware the main difference with this one
is this here heatsink which looks like
an actual heatsink instead of a fashion
accessory that you get on 99% of other
motherboards before that this video is
brought to you by Dollar Shave club's
daily essentials starter set this full
grooming kit ships at five dollars and
includes a trial sized versions of the
companies at popular shave butter body
wash and wipes and also includes a solid
high quality razor and a full set of
cartridges go to dollarshaveclub.com
slash gamers nexus to get the daily
essentials starter kit for just $5 and
with free shipping or click the link
below so this right here this is very
nice to see it even comes with a little
fan that is actually hooked up over a
standard three pin connector that fan is
normally plugged into this fan header
right here so if you actually want it to
like replace the fan or get rid of it
completely and then use like a larger
fan to blow air over that heatsink
you can and you can still have it hooked
up to the same fan header with the same
controls as the original plan had so
that's kind of neat
also the this heatsink is very very high
surface area so I mean yeah the this
this is what I'd like to see on a lot
more motherboards but you know now it
doesn't look very pretty does it but
personally I like the very sort of this
whole motherboard kind of has in my
opinion a very business aesthetic like
there's not really any unnecessary fluff
anywhere anyway let's get into some of
the overclocking features that it comes
with it's not that extensive and then
we'll get into the vrm so right off the
bat you get a power button you get a
reset button you get a postcode
you also get a clear CMOS button it's
located on the rear i/o and it's above
like reasonably far away from all the
USB ports somebody pointed out to me
that they accidentally hit clear CMOS
buttons on the rear i/o well this one
should be a tad harder to hit because
your USB ports are way below it so you
know that's that and then you get a six
pin power connector down here which i
think is completely unnecessary because
this is a like this is a micro ATX
motherboard and the reason why these six
pin power connectors exist is basically
to feed more power into your PCIe slots
the thing is this connector right here
as to 12 volt connection so reasonably
like you'll generally not want to push
more than 240 Watts through it but on an
EM ATX motherboard with only two you
know 16x slots that's 120 watts per slot
like that's almost twice this normal
specification so this down here you know
this is unnecessary on a motherboard
that supports 3-way or for way you know
multi-gpu setups I get it I get why
you'd want to have this but on a
motherboard that only goes to two-way I
can't really think of a scenario where
where this will actually be useful so
you know it's it's kind of pointless I
mean it doesn't hurt anything that it's
there but it is kind of pointless
because this is a micro ATX board so
that's that and finally you get also two
eight pin power connectors for your CPU
which makes sense because X 299 pulls
absolutely ridiculous amounts of power
if you have one of the high core count
CPUs and really you know push the push
the clocks on it so yeah that basically
covers the sort of the you know the more
general stuff and let's get into the
VRMs so the most important one and
largest one is of course this one right
above the CPU socket this is the VCC
in and it is controlled by this chip
right over here which is a International
rectifier three five two zero one which
technically now is Infineon because
Infineon recently bought international
rectifier now that is a up to eight
phase voltage controller but here it's
running in five phase mode then there's
five of these chips which you can't see
all of them but that's fine there's five
chips down there and those are IR $35.99
and those are running in doubling mode
so you can probably guess what what we
have here in terms of phase count this
is a one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten phase and the $35.99 is
not exactly the brightest doubler on
earth mainly because it's based on uh
it's actually a quadruple er so you
could if you wanted to you like if EVGA
felt like yeah and there was enough
space on this board with this controller
and this book this doubler well this
chip right here you could actually have
a twenty phase but uh here it's just
configured for two-phase configuration
because as far as I'm aware I are
doesn't actually have another dedicated
doubling chip so they have this thing
and that's it like this is the only one
you can get you want to double you buy
this if you want to quad you buy this
but the the issue with this thing is
it's not like it doesn't do any current
balancing at all which means that you do
get like a 10 phase interleaved output
it's just not very clever so if one of
the phases for whatever reason like on a
load transition or something ends up
pushing way less current than the other
phase on the same doubler the voltage
controller will not know about it and
it'll ignore it because the voltage
controller the three five two zero one
still sees the entire vrm as groups of
basically two phases so you like groups
like this those can
current balanced so if you had way too
much current going through these two
relative to everything else then these
two would get reduced duty cycles for a
bit to bring all of the other phases up
to equilibrium with like two equal
current output but if you have a current
imbalance between this power stage in
that power stage you can't do that
because the three five two zero one has
no idea that these two are actually
separate separate phases as far as its
concerned this is one phase and the 3599
doesn't do anything either that that
chip is has eight pins PWM signal goes
in PWM signals come out that's basically
all that chip does so it doesn't have
any monitoring or logic in it or like
more advanced logic in it so this is
like it's a ten phase it counts as a ten
phase it's just kind of dumb
so the actual power stage is used here
our IR 35:56 --is which is not the most
powerful power stage and I can't write
today so 35:56 that's a 50 amp power
stage and that means your theoretical
maximum output for this entire vrm is
500 amps this is actually above the
maximum theoretical output of any ASIS x
to 99 motherboard which is in my opinion
extremely disappointing no for this
board but for the company
right I like I'm disappointed with the
ASUS motherboards like this you know the
the like because the thing is like asus
has a RAL rampage six apex and that's
still stuck on an eight phase and then
there's this thing which is just this is
an EM ATX motherboard it's never gonna
probably never gonna see liquid nitrogen
unless I decide to put it on liquid
nitrogen because EVGA did send me a
review sample of this motherboard which
is why the picture quality is terrible
so that's if if you're wondering why
that what's up with that it's because I
took the picture and since I can rely
since I have the board in hand I can
read the chips myself I don't need the
photo for that
more so anyway max output is
theoretically 500 amps though if you
were actually running that you know if
you had a sky like CPU and you had to
push 500 amps which on liquid nitrogen
you just about might hit that kind of
current output kind like not really but
you can get pretty close to it 500 amps
2 volts you would be looking at about a
hundred and thirty watts of heat output
on this vrm and at that point this
heatsink right here would not be
adequate but that's why EVGA makes the X
299 dark because the X 299 dark has a 12
phase a bigger heat sink and that that
kind of power output only produces about
96 watts of heat instead of 130 so that
gives you some reference point for Y you
know we have even stronger VRMs on the
extreme overclocking boards but looking
at more reasonable applications like say
well if you wanted to run an X 299 chip
on air you can so if you were on air
you'd be looking at around 200 to 300
watts of CPU power consumption because
much more than that and your heatsink is
not gonna deal with it that's just kind
of a hard limit for air cooling though I
don't know maybe if somebody like if
there was a like a heatsink with like an
absolute ton of heat pipes they might be
able to exceed that but all of the the
ones that like I've dealt with you you
basically like you swap out the fans for
something ridiculously loud and you're
still stuck at 300 watts for sort of
maximum heat dissipation but 200 to 300
watts for those kinds of power levels
the vrm would only be producing 14 to 20
watts of heat which is slightly more
than what the X 299 dark would do under
the same low you know under the same
power output but then again that dark
has a much bigger vrm this kind of heat
output on the vrm should be no issue for
this heat sink right here especially
because it has forced air flow through
the
because of the fan so that's great and
then for water cooling you're gonna be
looking at 300 to save 500 watts you can
actually push 600 watts ish on water
cooling if you have a seriously massive
water cooling loop but generally
speaking you're gonna top out around 500
going much above that is Jenn or like
it's not really practical on water
actually it's just not really practical
in any circumstances to go above 500
Watts worth of CPU power consumption so
with 300 to 500 watts of power
consumption the the motherboard would be
producing 20 to 39 watts of heat on the
vrm which that should still be well
within the capabilities of this heatsink
mostly because of the fan if it didn't
have the fan then like I think any same
thing exceeding much more than 25 watts
would actually start being problematic
because this does have a pretty high fin
density and so like its passive cooling
capabilities aren't gonna be exactly
incredible but the way this is actually
set up is that fan blows basically into
like light these faint like there's
basically channels set up for air to go
through like those fins right here that
I highlighted and so the fan actually
blows into those things directly and
then you'd have hot hair exhausting out
the top and bottom of the heatsink so
that's it's a really good way to design
it because yeah it massively improves
the VR I'm cooling situation and also
EVGA has a very thin thermal pad on the
bottom of that heatsink which really
really surprised me because a lot of
motherboards they'll go for like
ridiculously thick pads because the
thicker your your thermal pad is a you
know the worse your manufacturing
tolerances can be but EVGA is using what
looks like a point five millimeter pad
which is like the smallest normal
thermal pad thickness that you would
normally see so yeah that heatsink
should have like that
heatsink basically makes this
motherboard a lot better than a lot of
the other X 299 boards because VR my is
this is comparable to a lot of
motherboards it's better than some it's
worse than others but there's not that
many boards that come with and this to
cool the vrm and this makes a huge
difference so I really really like that
right there so that covers the VCC in
you know it might be viable for liquid
nitrogen but I don't like I already have
the X to ninety-nine dark so I don't see
a good reason to abuse this little board
but if it turns out that the BIOS is
actually capable which it might be
because or this board doesn't like
versus the dark the main loss on this
motherboard is that the dark has a whole
bunch of LEDs scattered around it for
trouble for like easier troubleshooting
which is really handy when you're on
liquid nitrogen and stuff stops working
and you're going like well I don't know
what isn't working and the post code
isn't being helpful then those LEDs get
you know are really really useful but
those are all missing here but you know
there's plenty of other boards that
don't have them and you can run those on
ln2 fine so if this I don't know it it
might be viable but it will really
depend on if the the BIOS is up to up to
scratch because there are certain
voltages that you need to have control
over and voltage ranges which is I think
EVGA might not give you like ridiculous
voltage range on this board just because
it's meant for you know nor like
high-power em ATX gaming builds more so
than or like editing builds or well
whatever you want to do with the name em
ATX form factor motherboard with the
next $2.99 CPU just null lnto because
they have another board for that and
that's the dark but this does still have
the two memory slot like one memory slot
per channel situation from the dark so
I'd hope that it's decent at memory
overclocking as well and at that point
you know it's just like well does it
have the voltage because the vrm would
mostly be okay until you like hammered
an 18 cores
things like the eighteen courgettes
ridiculous but the other chips should be
able to handle those so that's the
that's the VCC in there and then we move
on to the minor rails
starting with VCC sa and vc cio and
since I don't know which one is which
and my best guess is that this is VCC SA
and this is VCC IO well they're both
controlled by this chip right here so
basically that that'll be like that in
terms of controls and that chip is a
ir35 2:04 not a zero one this is
basically it's the same family of seep
chip as the three five two zero one it's
just a lower phase count which makes it
cheaper here it's running in a 1+1
configuration for the VCC i/o and a VC
CSA the power stages are again 3550
sixes which is ridiculous overkill for
these rails because neither of these
does very much especially if you're on
ambient cooling VCC i/o and VCC sa my
recommended range for both of these is
like one point one volts we see CIO and
1.05 VCC si
there's no reason to raise them higher
than that and in fact even on liquid
nitrogen I end up running the si si si
around 1.05 and VCC io at like one point
three five because on ln2 it really
helps with mesh overclocking but on
ambient cooling I've not actually
noticed any benefit from raising either
of these and I did all of my ambient
benchmarking with with the X 299 dark
around one point one volts for both so
yeah you know neither of these needs to
do a whole lot of a whole lot in terms
of moving power both of them at for 15
amps output at 1.2 volts assuming you
would set it to 1.2 volts because the
power efficiency gets a little bit
better if you go for lower voltage 15
amps 1.2 volts you'd be looking at about
1.3 watts of heat for each which you
that's they don't have heat sinks so it
makes sense that EVGA opted for
ridiculous overkill though there are
plenty of motherboards out there which
for VC CIO and vccs I go with much much
weaker single-phase vrm designs compared
to this because again like these are not
high current rails so yeah that this is
just overkill this is nothing to
complain about they're moving on we get
the memory and you can't see anything on
that side because it's all blur well
this sides not that much better is it
but the memory situation is similar on
both sides so you have two phases
they're separate they're not together
there's another ir35 2:04 running I
assume 1+1 again because I've not
actually managed to well I don't have a
pin out for these chips so I can't
actually figure out what they're wired
up to because I can't check where where
their pwm signal lines go but I'm
assuming what's going on is so this
one's VDD are just because that's where
the VDD our rail normally sits and then
this one should be VPP and both of these
should are controllable in software I
assume so they're going to be hanging
off of the three five two zero four so
yeah and both of those and actually for
the actual power stages there these are
not the 35:56 s I mean they're a lot
smaller
these are TDA 888 24 zeros from Infineon
which is basically the same as all the
international rectifier stuff at this
point because IR is owned by Infineon
but the TDA 88 24 zero is a 35 amp dr
Moss part and that's basically a type of
power stage and I think it's actually
just a naming convention difference
between Infineon and a lot of the other
manufacturers where a lot of the others
will call their stuff power stages which
as far as I'm aware power stages are all
technically direct Moss anyway so
yeah so Infineon Infineon calls this a
dr moss whereas like international
rectifier considers the 35:56 a pal i
our stage yeah because you know spelling
power with e is just too mainstream when
you can spell it with i but it makes
sense them but so power IRC so you have
the power our stage from international
rectifier and then you have just dr moss
for anthony on 35 amps output for memory
power is ridiculous overkill ddr4 really
doesn't pull that much current so yeah I
know I mean the X 299 dark was a similar
situation where there was like a 60 amp
power stage from Intersil on the memory
and that was just like more overkill so
yeah this is slightly less overkill but
still very very overkill and more and
the same applies to the VPP rail like
this barely pushes him you like this
pushes even less power than the VDD are
so this is basically like using the TDA
88 240 0 imeem to the 88 240 is mainly a
cost-saving measure because I know in
EVGA uses this power state dr mosque
well it's a type of power stage so power
stage on a whole bunch of other
motherboards like the z3 like I think
most of their z3 70 line up uses these
so for like V core and everything
basically so since they have a bunch of
them for those boards I assume the logic
was well we already have a ton of these
we can just smack them onto the em ATX
board where we don't need the current
handling capabilities of the 35:56 is so
and on the other side of the the CPU
socket you get the exact same thing 3 5
2 0 4 read EDR VPP so it's actually
basically mirrored right across the CPU
socket so yeah that's that's the that's
pretty much it for the board there's not
really much else left well actually
nothing left at this point so this on
like
hardware-wise I have nothing to complain
about you get your to eight pins you get
a very powerful dumb ten phase
VCC and vrm which will also run the core
if you use a KB like X but KB like X is
just this thing that shouldn't really
exist so you know you have your nice
powerful VCC and VR MVCC sa and vc cio
are both massive overkill because they
need to actually cool themselves through
just the surface area of the chip and
the surrounding PCB so you know massive
overkill is the easiest way to which
achieve a scenario where they won't
overheat memory power is must-have
overkill you get some basic overclocking
features like you get basically the bare
minimum to get around with and you get
this unnecessary six pin down here so
yeah not much to complain about
considering that this is you know not a
not like a top top-of-the-line board
very well balanced I'd say and I think
like I still think this could be viable
as like the the cheaper alternative to
the X 299 dark so I may or may not well
we'll see like I still need to get
around to testing the board but hardware
at wrong wise I really like what I'm
seeing so far so that's it for the video
thank you for watching if you'd like to
support gamers Nexus there's a there's
