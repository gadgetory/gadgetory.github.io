at the same time and the same day and
this is because of review embargoes or
what folks commonly referred to as NBA
is not necessarily the same thing but
the same general idea behind each so
today for the Sunday topic we will be
explaining what a review embargo is and
why for the most part is something that
we actually like in the media the very
basics of it a review embargo is a
statement official or otherwise and an
agreement between the media outlet and
the manufacturer that says you will not
release information on this product that
you have obtained under these conditions
until the specific date and time August
8 9 a.m. Eastern would normally be an
example of an embargo so for an example
a product under embargo would be
something like I've been informed I'm
not allowed to show that yet before
we're getting to this discussion this is
brought to you by our patreon backers at
patreon.com slash gamers Nexus we had a
goal there that was met not too long ago
where I said if you guys can help us
reach this will do more Sunday topics
where it's talking about industry or
things that drive me crazy or whatever
that would hopefully be entertaining to
watch so that's what this is part of go
to patreon.com/scishow and razaaq's is
to contribute thanks to those of you who
have done so already so examples of
things under embargo would include
pretty much everything we've reviewed at
least in the more technical side of
things video cards CPUs very
occasionally cases not too commonly an
embargo at its core is supposed to give
us time to adequately test review and
form an opinion on something so that we
can post content that actually has
substance and depth and value as opposed
to the alternative which is all the
media racing to be first that says that
very recently had their sort of
controversial policy where they said
we're eliminated review copies reviewers
get it on the same day as a consumer and
it was under the guise of saying well
it's only fair that reviewers have to
wait to play it until the same day of
consumers that was plainly bullshit and
just trying to move more copies of
things by eliminating critical reviews
prior to launch not going to go into
that today
all topic but the idea is well first of
all speaking as a reviewer or I should
say speaking for myself as a reviewer I
don't care about getting the thing early
for the status of having it early I care
about getting it early so I could work
on it it's not the world is a lot
different when you're not in the sense
of games like what that does is trying
to get a game early to play it but
you're trying to get it early so you can
start developing content it doesn't have
the same meaning there's a big
disconnect there so ignoring that has
the core moment that would be an example
of when embargoes are not present and
they probably should be because
something like a game you need a long
time to play it beat it form an opinion
but what happens without that embargo
there well what happens is all the
reviewers go out they buy the game or
acquire it as immediately as possible
and then start working on content so you
might have one or two hours in the game
and you're already looking at this like
okay how do I turn this into an article
into a video maybe they skip the review
and instead do something like funny
faces you can make in test six or
whatever where the content is just kind
of low depth but it gets high views
because its first and that's what
matters a lot of the time when you're
fighting for traffic which drives money
the alternative is of course trying to
pump out a review and doing it in a
couple of hours which is just going to
overlook all kinds of things that could
be bad with hardware it doesn't work
quite so easily because if you try to
force a review without any time put into
it it will show benchmarking takes a
while video card benchmarks take quite a
few days at the least depend on how
in-depth we go so that's the other
question is how long are these embargoes
normally and do they benefit us or the
consumer or manufacturer from
manufacturers perspective they might
want an embargo in place and theory
they'll say it's for more in-depth
reviews I would have to imagine well a
lot of that is also just to align with
specific launches release dates with
competition things like that how do we
release this product so that it best
competes in the market against whatever
the other people are making but
generally with video cards
we are given something like one week to
review them maybe two if we're really
lucky but it tends to be about a week if
you count the weekend and we always work
on the weekends or any day really that
needs to work so tends to be about a
week cpu's varies a lot of the time just
recently with Katy Lake I think we had
Katie Lee excused in December or
November with the early motherboards so
that was a really long review time
especially for something that ultimately
was kind of boring as a product so 7700
K didn't drive a lot of excitement I
think our review video for the 7700 K
has fewer views than our brand new AMD
risin news video so I should tell you
about how popular the Intel SKUs were
for the last generation that's just
because they have somewhat stagnated
which is again not as we talked about
that but that was an exceptionally long
time to review a product and it's great
because you can do things like in our
case finds the V core issues on some of
the motherboards or look at temperatures
and more depth than normally or run
different types of CT benchmarks like
adding blender into the benchmarking
routine maybe you add h.264 265 encoding
stuff like that that time is very
valuable now companies will want to
limit the amount of time they give you
depending on how confident they are in
the product so if you are concerned that
there are going to be more issues with
launch then you might want to give less
time for reviewers to look at the
product why would that be well as a
reviewer it would be I suppose
irresponsible would be best word to
publish a review or criticism of
something that contains information that
is highly critical if we haven't had
enough time to thoroughly research and
investigate whatever we think is wrong
with the product so if you don't have
enough time to research it generally
what happens is you say ok we're going
to just have to shelve this and come
back to in a week or something when
we've got more time to really dig into
it and figure out if this is actually a
problem or if this is a problem with our
bench or problem with our methodology or
whatever you have to wait till you're
confident and with a shorter embargo
that's going to happen more often as
opposed to with a longer embargo period
with more time to work on it we have
more time to figure out oh this is
actually a very valid concern
we should probably publish this and
explain what's going on so that would be
one reason you'd have a shorter embargo
other than the most common reason which
is just the products not ready okay so
let's cut away from some of the basic
stuff this is all very unstructured as
usually for these types of videos but
and instead talk about the behind the
scenes of what happens generally
agreeing to an embargo or an NDA goes
like this the manufacturer emails us and
says hey we have some cool news for you
can you agree to an embargo of this date
and time and I'll reply to them and say
I guess so I'd really like to know more
about what this news is but sure let's
let's agree to that date and time and
see what you have to say so they'll give
us the information and then we sit on it
until the date and time expires and then
what happens is generally a video an
article or nothing will get published at
that date and time the case of nothing
that's because it was inconsequential
news no one really has the time to look
into it so we've skipped it but for the
most part that's the transaction you'll
notice there I didn't say the one thing
that seems to be a very common
misconception among folks outside of the
industry looking in is that there's no
generally agreements there's no physical
will send you a contract and you sign
this contract and it has all these
clauses in it that's really rare there
are a few times where I've gotten
contracts that I've had to fill in a
signature and email it back and those
are normally it's a tendency based on
company more than product so some
companies will do that whereas most of
them that we work with just have an
email simple agreement yes or no and
it's built on trust the whole industry
for the most part with regard to this
topic is built on trust if you really
screw up and disrespect the embargo they
probably just won't work with you again
it's not like they're going to drag you
through court or something so there's
not normally a contract but embargo is
generally the term that's used to refer
to news embargoes news a ban on posting
news until it's the embargo is lifted
whereas MDA more specifically would be
disclosure agreement generally an actual
contract is involved but people kind of
mix and match them it doesn't really
there's no really specific difference
between them so that's mostly semantics
but yeah generally the process is they
ask us to hold the news and we do now
there are times when I'll say no for
example I've been asked to sign back
dated embargoes before NDA's where
someone will want to talk to us about a
product and they filled in the date and
it goes back in time which is absolutely
not ok because it's a good chance we've
seen the product or talked about it or
whatever maybe visited a factory and saw
one and it's in the background of a
photo somewhere I'm not going to agree
to that because that who knows what
we've already done in the last few
months so back dated things I definitely
don't agree to there are other times
where maybe we've already acquired the
information elsewhere and I don't need
their primary source of information in
that case I might not agree either if I
feel like it would be more beneficial to
use our stores to go ahead and publish
what we have as opposed to potentially
limiting myself to what I can say based
on whatever this embargoed information
is which is very often not that
technical of us it's really that you've
gotten fortunate enough to talk to an
engineer or someone but or it's review
as opposed to news here's another good
topic about this I was thinking about is
what happens if you break an embargo
there are two types of breaking an NDA
or an embargo one is unintentional the
other one is intentional both of them
happen I think intentional pradhans a
whole lot more and there are plenty of
sites out there that post leaks and
information that a lot of the time
beliefs are not we've already seen but
we can't comment on or talk about
because we're under an embargo or an NDA
and that site might not be they've
obtained the information some other way
almost definitely not directly through
the company they're not breaking an
embargo or an NDA
they're probably in no legal trouble
they're just posting a leak that they've
obtained externally and that sucks
because we're not allowed to comment on
it or talk about it while all these
thousands or millions of people are
reading about this item this news item
before the embargo has lifted and so
we're sitting here with weeks of work
into something sometimes looking at
sites postings way in advance and you
could imagine that would be pretty fresh
like we're putting hundreds of hours
into this in some cases again the longer
embargoes or dozens in the very easiest
cases and every time an article goes up
that breaks embargo you're basically
losing money because you're losing the
potential to gain traffic because as a
news topic ages it loses views very
rapidly
the longer a news items a new item
generally dies in about a day that's
kind of when when people stop caring so
to see embargoes broken by sites that
are less scrupulous or don't provide
actual testing of their own and just are
leaking things is very frustrating and
people in media we all do talk to each
other and generally agree that those
sites are not fun to work in the
industry with but nothing happens to
them because they've never agreed to an
embargo or an NDA so they're just
getting their info separately there's
really nothing you can do to stop it but
what about if you intentionally break an
embargo and you actually were under one
well generally hopefully you've got a
damn good reason to do it but secondly
of course the RISM from peers and
potentially being at least temporarily
blacklisted by the company where they
might not work with that media outlet
again for ever or for a certain amount
of time so it depends on how much the
company thinks they should be punished
for it what about unintentionally we
have I've done that once in recent
history that I can remember and I know
we have certainly seen it plenty of
times so the company that makes Mirage
torn banner studios they made chivalry
previously we were at PAX maybe a year
or two ago or GDC I think we were at GDC
and they had a review embargo except for
not review a news embargo except for the
next day at I don't know I think 12 p.m.
or something and this was a very simple
thing of my system was set in Eastern
time zone we worked on the content
really wait late until 3:00 a.m. or
something and we're waiting to post it
when and scheduled it and scheduled it
on Eastern time zone so pop up three
hours ahead of one's embargo lifted no
big deal they emailed us pretty
immediately of course they see that
and they're like hey embargo what's
going on I was like oh sorry so you know
if you catch it early enough you just
set it back to private and publish it
later or you apologize explain it and
move on no one really cares if it's not
a malicious intent
now of course not a great thing to do
regularly but a one-off you're not going
to really get a whole bunch of trouble
especially if you are going to work with
them to either hide the content until
embargo time or if it's only an hour
away or whatever just apologize and kind
of move on so it definitely happens now
it doesn't happen a whole lot at least
not for us I know that recently for the
EVGA icx coverage Paul and Jay and I
were making fun of Kyle because he
accidentally released his icx video a
day in advance the right time just the
wrong day and he immediately hit it no
big deal Jacob from EVGA called him one
was like hey your reviews on my cat was
like oops oh shut that the private so
you know we make fun of them but I don't
think no no hard feelings or anything -
just a normal mistake so break and
embargo happens regularly it's just a
matter of was it intentional or
unintentional and should there be any
consequences that covers most the basics
in general kind of recapping embargoes
are good when they give us time to
properly evaluate something bench market
and form an opinion as opposed to racing
to be first which is absolutely what
would happen without an embargo and that
is because be in first matters if you
are not all going to be timed releases
now when everything comes out at the
same time I've seen a few comments that
are occasionally like all the same
information was just released by
released by all the youtubers and all
the tech reviewers why this is boring
now I have to watch the same information
from all these videos so hopefully an
embargo gives everyone enough time to
actually to develop some unique angle to
their story for example our icx coverage
was a very heavy in the thermals and
talks not how the thermistors work how
the power design was laid out so that
gave us a bit of a unique angle
other folks have their unique angles
were they different types of testing on
it so hopefully an embargo gives enough
time to have at least one of those gems
in there but otherwise you basically
just me pick someone or a couple
reviewers and consume the content and
you know you don't need to watch every
single one but yeah of course I'll
release at the same time but the idea is
it sets a fair playing field so rather
than fight each other again to be first
we can produce depth and this is kind of
an issue you see with with most news
media I think today but normally it's
not in a scenario where there's a
product I can have a fixed launch time
Dayton and embargo its if you have just
breaking news of course everyone's going
to tear each other apart to get to it
first
so I think that kind of covers it I'm
sure there are a million more things I
could say about this I've been dealing
with embargoes probably since 2008 so
there are plenty of stories plenty of
caveats things like that in general we
like them there are very occasional
times when I just flat-out refused
because they're sometimes ridiculous
like well at CES there were at least two
instances where I had emails come in 12
hours before an embargo lift and say hey
do you want to agree to this embargo and
the you know you're sitting there at a
convention center do you agree to this
embargo I've probably already gotten
that information from someone else and
there's a very good chance we've already
filmed something or they are in the
process of writing and publishing
something so that the response to that
is kind of like I screw you know you
didn't give me enough time for this like
what is it what am I supposed to do with
that 12 there's a period of embargoes or
NDA's where they become so short that
all they're doing is constraining you
and forcing you to avoid publishing
something or reducing the amount of
information that can be published as
opposed to providing time to analyze the
information so the good and bad it just
comes down to the outlet and their
ability to look at it and figure out if
it is favorable for their viewers and
readers or not and at that point they
can they can make decisions on whether
to agree or to modify the terms which we
also do quite regularly in the very few
instances
that there are written NDA is to agree
to but for the most part it's just a
simple do you agree yes or no here's a
date and time so that pretty much wraps
up the embarrass because I think that
was those plenty of depth as always
