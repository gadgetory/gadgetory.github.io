nexus donna it is something like seven
or eight a.m. i'm not sure i've been up
all night because Borderlands the
pre-sequel just came out and I was
benchmarking it these are two AMD cards
let's get rid of one of those and make
it a bit more even so I've got a lot of
video cards behind me a lot of them let
me just emphasize there are more video
cards than I can presently count bit
early but that's part of it so we've got
a 980 extreme and a 270x right now and a
lot of other ones and what I did was
benchmark Borderlands peace equal as I
do with every major triple a title
launch what you need to know is this the
game has very optimized graphics
settings it runs pretty much on every
video card that it's very uninteresting
in terms of benchmark performance but
that's okay if you actually want to play
the game and play it with high settings
because it'll run well so the 250 x is
our bottom line card for this benchmark
and it is performing at about 60 FPS
average with ultra settings with max
settings 60fps it's 90 FPS when you're
playing it at about medium settings
which is a both of these are things that
I configured I configure these settings
custom for the benchmark so it should be
pretty optimized and I talked about that
in the full article link to the
description below but the 250 x is a 75
to 90 dollar card and it's playing this
game at basically playable settings if
you want to play on ultra with a
guaranteed 60 FPS at 1080p this card is
really heavy guaranteed 60fps 1080p then
you're probably going to want to look
into the 750 ti which as I've said it
then every other one of these reviews it
is the best value for gaming and the
270x is also very good it's very
competitive in price with the 750 Ti so
look between us 270x at the 750 ti now
Borderlands it is optimized specifically
for nvidia and runs and videos physics
so if you like the explosions and rag
doll effects and things like
that physics gives you an advantage of
in Borderlands you should probably be
leaning towards Nvidia the effects
aren't that huge of a difference it's
not a deal breaker for me I'd buy
whatever fits your budget best and gives
you the performance you want depend on
if your multi monitor or singer single
monitor it's easy but at the end of the
day for Borderlands if you're playing
single monitor 1080p and you want to
play on medium settings you don't care
about Max just get either a tooth DX or
a 750 and you're good you will be able
to play that game on medium settings all
day long the problem if you want to play
on a basically max settings sands 16 x
AF I set it to 8x and I sub an isotropic
filtering you'll probably want to 750 Ti
whether 270x anything above that is way
overkill and in the hundreds of FPS as
you can see in the benchmark so that's
really all I have to say about the
borderlines benchmark check the link in
the description below for full details
and i will see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
