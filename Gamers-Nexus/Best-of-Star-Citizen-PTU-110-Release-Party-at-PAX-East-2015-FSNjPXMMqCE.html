I'll go better than last year's pax east
we're going to be showing you one of the
new game modes it's going to be the MPS
module that will be out later this month
and also talk a little bit about what
will be coming out in the next few days
so let me get to it okay so here's
another change that we're making is
actually something to be playing for a
long time I know there's a large debate
between yo who uses a mouse to aim and
new flyers around with a joystick and
one of the intentions actually was
always that if you had gimballed weapons
there was a sort of downside to them as
in you couldn't necessarily have as big
of a powerful a weapon so as of the 1.1
build the way it works is most good
mounts as long as the size 2 or above
will be able to have a gimbal mount
attached to it but if it's a sight to
gun mount then you would put a size 2
gibble now and it only accepts the size
one gun in it so you're you're sort of
trade off is either you can have a fixed
gun that size 2 or you can have a gimbal
gun that size 1 so you sort of have a
trade-off between fixed guns more power
or better precision better aiming but
less power so it's sort of it I think a
fairly we'll see but I think it will be
a good trade-off between people that are
flying with joysticks and people that
are flying with Matt mass but that's
something that we're doing with 1.1 it's
the place you can spend your egg-soaked
right a while ago electronic access was
bought out by original systems
and that initiation is a digital
storefront so that's the digital
storefront that you can spend the red
credits that you play um playing arena
commander and also later on airplane the
FPS and so that's where if you play more
you at the rack and you'll be able to
get different weapons or a lot of
different chips without having to sort
of pledge your pay from so it's sort of
the system that we talked about this
going to allow people to you know just
have that baseship and still try out a
whole bunch of stuff in arena commander
a triumph of your peers without having
to plant for anything extra which is
something that we wanted for the final
game and we sort of felt like we need to
bring it up ahead of schedule one of the
other big improvements it's in the 1.1
field and we were hoping to release the
1.1 build today but we still had some
fairly like legally bugs so we're
probably going to be releasing it on
Tuesday so when I one more day of fall
testing on Monday and then released on
Tuesday this what's that oh yeah well
yeah there's a couple of nice things
which will show you to me the 1.1 field
one of the biggest ones which I noticed
that people already on the PT you had
shots and videos of is the new damage
system that we're rolling out with 1.1
so our old damage tech was pretty cool
we model the whole bunch of different
damage of different states but you know
we had discrete models for each
different one of the levels so we
basically had pristine 25% fifty percent
75% one hundred percent damage and each
one of those damage levels could have
multiple pieces that were breaking off
and so there's a lot of work that the
artists did so in fact to give you an
idea you know a base Hornet is about 15
megabytes of pristine and if you added
on all the damage state modeling and all
the LEDs that come with it it was a
hundred megabytes on disk and so one of
our concerns outside of the fact there's
a lot of manual operation was that you
know with a big sort of online
multiplayer game us to live
the data over there you know I with
broadband is that you know how you know
how much data are we going to deliver
and can we actually fit it all the
memories one of the other properties
when you have that much geometry even if
you have a lot of memory is on the cpu
side your GPU see if you only got two
gigabytes on the GPU you've got to shift
all the mesh memory over like the vertex
data and everything over to the GPU and
so even if you have a lot of CPU memory
you can get sort of holdups in the
gameplay because it's shifting from like
normal system memory over to GPU memory
and so one of the things we thought okay
we're going to have to be a little
smarter about this and not have as much
you know mesh data because we already
have a lot because the ship's themselves
are incredibly detailed and complicated
so you know the olin analogies you'll
had vast amount of parts so we in 250
measures bishop is quite a lot so and
that's kind of what we were doing on the
old damaged technique and sort of see
the horn and broken up broken up into
different pieces sounded you yeah go
we've got some nice videos to show when
you'd understand so we basically
procedurally model like when we hit on a
surface we model whether it's a
ballistic whether it's a laser whether
it's an energy blasts whether it's
explosive blast we have defamation
thickness temperature of bird and it's
all very cool so the actual effects are
where you hit exactly on the ship you'll
see we don't need the predefined states
anymore or the LEDs we basically take
the pristine mesh we have it pre cut it
to all the obvious sort of breakable
parts and then everything gets
procedurally modeled and then if there's
enough damage at a same point that will
break off the partnership which is quite
cool and we use the x11 and direct
compute to enable you know the more
complex damage model improve visuals and
we'll longer term the using sort of
Direct X 12 them opengl next so here's a
little video of it
you
whenever that's the damage Tecton in
action so as you can see if you're
really good you can write your name with
someone else's shit so I think that
would be the ultimate form of T Bagga T
humiliation I love you go to see the
best give me video with some money just
to write their name on someone else all
right and so they fake the last thing
the Italian ER is going to be hanging
ready and we're working pretty hard and
getting it flag which is going to be
pretty awesome things are beasts and so
we have a little video for you
they
you
new high standard of shit bubbling that
we've done the techniques that were
built to use of the techniques that are
going to be using all the ships with
doing a refactor of the constellation of
the freelancer the Dalton road you will
be bringing it to the level that you've
seen retire I think when you get the
hang of the few you guys don't have the
retaliator will like it because it's a
it's really pretty awesome job is done x
factor UK guys making this and that will
be in the 1.1 release so i guess i'll
choose a problem alright so the next
thing it's kind of what we're here to
show parts of and we'll be coming out
very soon is the ground war so first of
all we're just going to sort of give you
a bit of an animation update because one
of the things that has put as slightly
behind is that we decided at the end of
last year to redo the skeleton and rig
on our base character and add a lot more
to it as a whole muscle system now and
we've actually went and scanned the
selected a bunch of different male
models of female models and scandals
we've actually got like real proper
Scott later and Belgium is sort of it
took some time it took a little more
time that we thought so it actually we
were hoping to release the FPS module
right here at PAX East but that's one of
the reasons why we're going to be
releasing it in two to three weeks time
depending because the animation so I
know the animation the animation
scientist takes a lot of tweeting to get
right so it's one of the things we're
doing but so basically are yeah we weave
out the entire renovation set for FPS so
it's add a lot more sort of rifle and
pistol realistic handling right
I think there's a quite a few people
that sack star citizen that have
military or law enforcement experience
and yeah and so you guys are always the
first to say no that's not the way you
handle a gun or so you know we actually
went out and we actually did this at a
mansion area at the end of last year we
have a couple of fairly badass military
advisors that were there for their
motion capture doing the motions it's a
lot more realistic animation set which I
think ultimately everyone's going to
delight so well hopefully kick ass and
all the rest of stuff so here's a little
video we did all those was we had some
issues with our pitching stuff so here
we go this sort of shows you this was
pax Australia and then we'll sort of cut
between sort of pax Australia kind of
where we are now
compositions a lot better the gun
public's fairly better i think so i
thought this looked good last year but I
just figure doesn't have any sound by
the way just later
and that's the old walk which you could
go there also the city road where you
could say well he's a bit stiff so you
can see him straight from left to right
here you'll see him moving in his
motions a lot better
there's no way there's no secondary sort
of animation we actually have a full
muscle system which there's a sealable
video the end that kind of demonstrates
although it's a fairly short
but generally we take the animations
much better than before which was one of
the bigger complaints and it's still got
away so this is that this is a silly
that this they all mesh on the left the
guy in the Middle's in the is the new
one which has a property forming
skeletal system and if we go to we are
the red is the muscle system that you
see for the different stuff so anyway
that's the quick animation
so we still have so much to do which is
one of the reasons why we're not giving
you the FPS this week but we have a
whole bunch of extra sort of you know
the difference between going from here
to stopping and all the rest there's a
lot of transition animations that need
to happen so that's all stuff that's
going in right now we've done all the
animations we just have to work it into
CryEngine the cover system is going to
be a fully really kind of cool cover
system you'll also be able to slide it
to cover and do stuff like that you know
a hit death reaction like when you get
here in different places and that's all
the stuff that we're working on a
finessing we've got some pretty cool
crouch movement we got pro movement as
well and we're also going to have sort
of three stages of movement so that's
sort of like a off position is an
alerted position in sort of your your
eye inside radius position when sort of
running around with the weapon out will
be sort of more fidelity of animation
station so our goal is basically well to
have pretty damn badass soldiers running
around so that's it zero-g which we are
going to be showing you people are going
to get to play play on zero-g here a
little bit it's pretty well that still
got a bunch of animation of programming
we've got to do to get that sort of full
style of have you seen the film gravity
in terms of like you know grabbing and
pulling and pushing we've got the basics
of that system in but it needs a lot of
finesse but that's one of the big goals
and what those two things are there
that's really what's going to be making
that's what's preventing us releasing
the FPS right now what we plan to
release in about three weeks time okay
so we asked everything you like to do in
fiction stuff
so its attention into the conventional
software is day one it says little
startup with a couple of folks like
change ROM enough and change my diet and
well they've created a new household
realistic scenario which is called
skarmory
and that easily available deplane is
simple in haggar of course available for
electronic access okay so you can choose
two types of the base FPS module gets
released has two game modes so the first
one is what we demoed in pax australia
so it's more traditional combat it's
more like counter-strike or something
that's on the gold horizon space station
and in that will have eight verses eight
play a combat and it's Marines versus
outlaws you battle many weapons armor
all the rest of stuff and the whole
environment damageable and you know
disabled Lighting's you can also turn
the gravity off and on of the station so
that sort of changes the playing field
when you're in in a combat situation and
here's a little walkthrough of the
environments you can sort of see the
different locations do we didn't get a
chance to do this and impacts Australia
so you can sort of see because I the
kind of a really detailed and beautiful
fun environment that I think will be a
lot of fun to blast each other
everything then the second game mode
which is the one that we know do you
live here that people play is zero
gravity so everyone see the Ender's Game
nobody's pretty much that it's
in astro arena actually is going to be
16 verses 16 up to the necessary has to
be 16 min 16 and basically it's going to
be something that people could use sort
of train 0g movement mechanics and also
have a sort of fun I don't know like in
fiction so ultimately in the world of
fasteners that this would be something
you could form teams to compete with
just the same way that we can have
racing competition so there will be you
know leagues and championships and
everything else I got so deep it kind of
fun so one thing that you use is the
laser pistol which has a crackling beam
on it you'll see in action but basically
to go around in zero-g you can fire up
the beam when you can use it to pull
yourself around so now we're going to it
i don't know we are we want guys guys
ready think it's when I'm liberated each
other I believe the game is I think it's
best of seven the rules are is the first
team that memorizing all the other
members of the team or gets a player
through the enemy gate
yes
what
ha
so anyway it's got it is still got a
bunch of Polish there's a lot of little
glitchy things like for instance it's
going to be a different color by so
depending what team you're in I'm one's
going to be altered because of a lobby
and then there's gonna be a lot more
fine-tuning of the sort of zero-g motion
animations and the price awesome which
is that but I think ultimately long-term
actually could be kind of a fun thing to
do in stassi's and besides fly
spaceships
so after what one point one point one
comes out which the FPS module which
will be in probably by the end of this
month the next thing we're going to do
which we're going to show a preview of
at South by Southwest next week but it
will be in early April is a social
module and that's where you get to leave
your hanger walk around the planet side
in the case of the social module will be
static are caught in the stanton system
and i'll give you a preview of sort of
interacting on a planet side basis when
you're visiting planets so that should
be cool we're going to tell about in a
week so of you guys like that and then
this is the sort of schedule for this
year which we've talked about before to
the first person shooter module by the
end of this month social module next
month will be delivering it Green Air
Command the 2.0 which is a multi crew
stuff sort of some attack and the end of
the end of this year is going to be
squadron 42 so I think right now
20 hours about 70 missions about
releasing the end of this year so we
sort of decided this big we have this
big overarching storyline and so in you
know sort of is a non sort of weak
commanded trilogy we're going to have
this overarching trilogy of squadron
like this story yeah so we let me come
at the gun to open in the grace of Allah
and then we're going to have the sort of
very early build of the full position
universe we limited number of systems
but you'll be able to take off fly land
trade interact and do some of the
professions are all the professions and
I'll be the end of the year so that is
it to be on the presentation</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
