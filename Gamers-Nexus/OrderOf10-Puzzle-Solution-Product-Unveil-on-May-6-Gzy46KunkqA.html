with this mysterious box on the porch
and this mysterious triangle with
mysterious code in the box we checked
Twitter quickly and found that we were
pretty new to this hashtag included
herein and that was the hashtag order of
10 and that 10 is also represented
somewhere over here on a sticker so as
the day unfolded i were to patrick
lathan he's one of our puzzle guys at
the site he'd refused the puzzle games
and he helped me figure out a couple of
the basics of this but we've just posted
the solution to the website so if you
don't know how this started check out
that first video because I'm going to
spoil the whole thing for you right now
so first of all these pieces in the
corner you may remember my first video I
talked about this silver pattern over
here and this isn't just something that
was aesthetic on the physical piece it
was in the website as well and so as the
pieces were unlocked ours was the bottom
left or bottom right I don't know where
camera left and right are and next to
ours was the slash gear piece that was
in the middle left so when the two
pieces were butted together this silver
lining actually formed words as all the
pieces were finally unlocked we were
able to read what the word said from
each piece all six pieces there were six
total even though more than six of these
went out because we didn't see
duplicates for example we got the same
piece that statesman got from Austin and
slash gear got the same piece that
roosterteeth got so there were
duplicates out there just to make sure
this thing got solved probably when they
were butted together the word spell that
find the hidden directory and that was
discovered a bit before the rest of the
puzzle was solved so we we knew we had
to look for a directory someone found
the / register which was not the
intended hidden directory to be found
quite obviously based on P filler text
email response he got if he registered
in that time but we will come back to
the final hidden directory moment to the
next piece that needed to be discovered
was the individual words comprising that
directory name and so directory of
course is referring to directory on the
server for the website which was the
order of 10 com website all of this
stated are two pieces that we matched
immediately where the
compute piece that was this one with /
gears vision peace vision had the actual
sort of scene I chart that you would
potentially see if you went to an
optometrist and that charge correlated
perfectly with the chart that we had for
rps compute which happened to be a
binary code and if you look at the
bottom of the page that our piece
represented the sort of decipher version
of the binary code could be filled in
with pieces from the vision segments
over in the middle left if you filled
those in which Patrick lathan did for
the site you end up with the word
humanity so we don't we at this time
don't know what that means what we'll
find out in a second the next piece of
the puzzle that we worked on was
enlightened or enlightened and this was
done by Jack from Rooster Teeth he did a
fantastic job with this and his fans and
what they did is on the screen right now
the numbers from the collision page
correspond with the page that Jack was
working on that's the one from hg wells
this is from one of his books and this
page had the sort of hopscotch blanks
placed on them and if you look closely
at the other pages of collision page
those same hopscotch blanks are there
you can take those numbers and then the
numbers indicate on the page where the
empty where the empty boxes will be
filled where the letters go and
eventually you end up with a couple of
letters and scrambled form if you
unscramble that text you end up with
enlightened so now we've got humanity
and enlightened and we were still at
this point missing the last piece of the
puzzle and finally Paul's hardware woke
up hey Paul and he filled in that last
piece said oops I guess I had the last
one and so his one the top center that
peace is what eventually led us to
finalize the formation of this text find
the hidden directory and it was an
astronomy page this page contained
mentions of Kepler you may remember the
previous video I mentioned Fermi the hg
wells Paige said that HG Wells inspired
scientists Fermi was one of his two
primarily inspired scientists and that
is a previous Nvidia architecture as is
Kepler so we've got Kepler on the
Astronomy pay
there are planets shown on this page and
if you look at the previous tesseract
page you'll see that the planets and the
tesseract points have the same colors
and they have numbers that correlate
with one another working with Twitter we
were able to figure out that these
numbers and the corresponding stars on
the astronomy page spell shall be one
word sha ll be e so now we've got shall
be enlightened and humanity put it all
together you get humanity shall be
enlightened and finding the hidden
hidden directory is order of ten calm /
humanity shall be enlightened so that is
the solution to this puzzle at least for
now if you go there it takes you to a
page that has a countdown timer at the
time of filming this it was three days
and 19 hours which puts us at Friday
this week and that is when Dreamhack
kicks off as well so that's worth noting
certainly the puzzle itself is seems to
be a pointer to something like an unveil
and I'm going to go ahead and say that
this is probably Pascal because again
we've got the Fermi reference we've got
the Kepler reference I didn't seem
Maxwell actually which is kind of
interesting so I don't maybe I
overlooked the Maxwell but that would
certainly be a major one to talk about
if they're speaking the GPU
architectures for me that would have
been too obvious so that is my guess I
basically keep your eyes open for friday
this week we will certainly be on top of
it yeah this pretty fun puzzle so if
you're making a game or making hardware
do more of this because that is a cool
noise that is a a new way to do a press
release I suppose pretty fun stuff
article link to the description below if
you want to see how this came together
as it came together live the hashtag is
order of 10 on Twitter and that has the
full feed throughout the day with all of
the progression thanks for watching hey
Charlie post all video if you like this
type of content I'll see you all next
