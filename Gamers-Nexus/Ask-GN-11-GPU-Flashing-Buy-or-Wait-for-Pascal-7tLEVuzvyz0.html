dotnet and this is episode 11 of ask GN
we haven't done one of these for about
two weeks now because of the crazy game
launch season that's been going on I'm
sure you've all seen of course
battlefront fallout 4 black ops 3
there's at least one other one in there
we did some overwatch work as well so
it's been non-stop for the last few
weeks just benchmarking game after game
hours and hours a day with the help of
some of our testers like Mike gaglione
big shout out to him for helping out and
of course keegan doing the videos all
that so it's been a very crazy couple of
weeks here but we're back with svn so
let's just dive right into it the first
question here is from abs in 33 who says
I need some help overclocking my 6700 k
i'm using the asrock extreme6
motherboard with the corsair h100 5
cooler i'm currently at 4.4 gigahertz on
auto voltage but once i go above 4.4 it
crashes even with more voltage should I
mess with low blind calibration so this
is a good question as well one of the
things that we do when overclocked in CP
is for review purposes is disabled all
of the power saving stuff and this is
even without overclocking CP as we do
this because it's important to get
consistent test data for reviews as a
user you can kind of leave it on but
when you are overclocking it is a good
idea to disable some of the sea States
if it's an intel cpu which in this case
it is to disable the load line
calibration helps with some stuff it
helps with v droop which is the dip in
voltage so if you have a voltage supply
imaginal line just a line on a graph
every now and then it'll dip like that
and that's that's not a good thing
because as you approach higher clock
rates you can introduce a lot of
instability by any voltage drop like
that called V droop and load line
calibration helps with that so at higher
load line calibration settings you can
sustain a more consistent voltage but it
does risk blasting the CPU with voltage
and it can heat it up and I would
generally advise against maxing out load
line calibration because as you do max
it out you are
threatening the life span of your CPU
you're planning to replace in a year
anyway it's kind of it's one of those
now who cares but if you are trying to
keep this for long-term use I would not
max out load line calibration if you
enable it to some extent your
motherboard should have a recommendation
if it's a good board it'll normally
recommend you want fifty percent if
you're overclocking or you want a
hundred percent if you're doing an
extreme bossy or whatever but generally
using load line calibration will assist
as far as disabling it it is I probably
i probably wouldn't do that unless you
really have nothing else to disable so
go for the sea state's first just
checking my own notes here because i did
take some notes on this question you'll
want to do a base clock overclock so if
your stock at 4.4 with the multipliers
you can get a bit more out of the cpu
with a base clock or be clk increase and
that will allow finer control so you can
do smaller steps basically between the
clock rates and then you also want to do
manual voltage control so get off that
auto control and switch over to manual
and just do some burnin tests to see how
it performs if you want to do a real
world burnin test games like The Witcher
3 producer pretty good load four cpus
fire strike is a very good load test
that's kind of real world you can do the
combined test to stress the CPU and GPU
but or the physics test just stressed
the CPU but that's kind of that's where
I'd start with those power states and
you should probably get a bit more than
4.4 gigahertz but sometimes the silicon
is just not as good so it is possible
that your CPU in particular isn't that
great at overclocking or your
motherboard can be limited but the
extreme sticks isn't bad you should be
able to get a bit more the next question
is from caffee Oh or coffee ohh Who says
have you been how you been following my
search history this wasn't reply to the
overclock specially did last time just
got an r 9 290 reference card and i'm
hoping to watercool so i can overclock
or flash it to the r9 290x that is
definitely something you can do which is
an interesting thing with AMD cards do
you know if there are any concerns with
overclocking a reference to 90 if I
can't get a water block soon first of
all there are concerns with flashing it
in my experiences worked out pretty well
but you do carry a risk of bricking your
BIOS your firmware on the video card
when you flash it so for anyone
interested in that just know that you
carry a risk of potentially damaging or
disabling the video card even if it is
uncommon on some devices and talking to
reference cards only have one BIOS
normally so there's not really a
recourse or a case of action you can
take to resolve that with the
overclocking card this is one reason
they're really cool this is one reason
that things like the kingpin to stop
thought my head exists it's because they
have multi BIOS so if you do brick your
BIOS you trying to switch a physical
switch and you can enable the second one
and then you try it again hopefully with
something more stable but getting back
to the question here are there any
concerns with overclocking the reference
to 90s the concerns our thermals so the
reference to 90 has a pretty bad cooler
design we actually do have a reference
to 90 in house or 290x i should say if
you look at it the so this is our video
card right and this is where the slot is
over here where the fan is it uses a
blower fan which is a good thing
normally but it's got the whole intake
right here closed off except for one
spot so we have front intake from your
case it's not going where we want it to
go which is straight into the fins it's
got to go and set around the underside
of the faceplate and that into the
blower fan so it's not a great design
thermally and that will be a restriction
as long as you monitor your thermals
actively you'll be fine just use a 264
or what's a free tool hardware monitor
has a free tool hwmonitor and speed fan
has a free tool i think that's only cpus
though there there's a couple free tools
for modern we use a 264 which is a
professional utility I think they have a
trial version that you can use I would
use one of those monitor the GPU diode
temperature actively when you overclock
run your burn in test watch it furmark
furmark has a GP diode reader in it as
you run the test it's not the best test
in the world because it's a little more
stressful than necessary sometimes but
that is one way to see it and as long as
you're not sort of hitting dangerous
temperatures I personally like to stay
below 90
and that is still pretty darn hot but 90
is about where I started feeling
uncomfortable and then you definitely
want to be below you want to be able to
follow a 90 that's kind of that's kind
of my limit personally some cards will
go up to a max of 100 before they shut
down thermally but 90 is a good max and
even sitting there is not great for the
silicon and mantra muse but one thing
that's cool is with the new radeon
setting the suite you can do per game
overclocking so if you don't need the
overclocking for everyday use you don't
need it for counter-strike go but you
want it for The Witcher then you can do
that and I would recommend that for
purposes of longevity moving to a liquid
cooler first is a recommendation so I
would wait till you get that water
cooler if you haven't already gotten it
at this point next question or the last
question royal predator says right now
how smart is it to buy a GTX 980 TI so
this is this goes back to what I say at
the beginning the 980 TI and all the
existing cards especially at the top and
the high-end are still really good even
with Pascal coming and whatever Andy's
got next so just because there's new
architecture doesn't mean you should
stop your upgrade plans this is
something we've said regularly for the
last few years of operation there's
always something around the corner in
the hardware world once it gets to
Pascal you're gonna be like should I buy
this one or should i wait for whatever
the next one that amd's doing is and I
would just say if you need a card now
just by now because the next GPUs that
will compete with the 980 TI are quite a
ways out we're looking at 2016 sometime
probably towards the middle or end so I
really wouldn't hold back my upgrade
plans based on an architecture that
doesn't even publicly exist yet if you
have a good card already you can wait
but if you're buying now just get
something and use it if you really want
to save some money maybe by like a 960
or 970 and then invest more heavily in
the next architectures when they come
out but I would not halt my upgrade and
build plans for the things after skylake
or Zen or Pascal so that is all for this
