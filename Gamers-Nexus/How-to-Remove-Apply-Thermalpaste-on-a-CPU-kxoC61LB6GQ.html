Nexus tonight and I am here with my
hardware editor Patrick Stone to show
you how to remove and apply thermal
paste will cover how to thoroughly
remove and apply a new thermal paste to
your CPU in the event you are changing
the cooler or are simply working on a
new build at the end of this video I'll
give a little more depth and explain why
proper technique can make the difference
of azzam as much as a few degrees
Celsius actually in a real-world
environment so technique is important
and let's first go over what you need to
actually to remove the thermal paste you
will need to be ESD free of coarse
ground yourself before working on this
you can read our guide on how to do that
in the description below you need to be
grounded because your your CPU won't
like it a few ESD it so keep that in
mind you also want a anti-static
compliant cloth is really what what we
say but you can use a q-tip and I'll
honestly just be careful not to zap
anything and also be sure to remove any
residual fuzziness from the CPU once
you're done you don't want that getting
into the socket once you've installed it
you need rubbing alcohol normal 70%
works fine but 90% rubbing alcohol is
preferable just don't drink it and of
course you will need new thermal paste
to apply now time to remove some thermal
paste or thermal compound so apply some
rubbing alcohol to your cloth or q-tip
as it were and brace the CPU you'll want
to rub with the grain of the metal
preferably to make things easier to
ensure that no thermal paste is left in
the crevices and continue removing the
compound until the surface is shiny and
clean you should see the alcohol
evaporating away momentarily so set the
CPU aside after you have thoroughly
removed all of the thermal paste and let
it dry out before reapplying new thermal
paste that way you're not wasting any
and that way no no rubbing alcohol gets
stuck in the system so do the same for
your CPU cooler it is not imperative
that this is as clean as new because
some thermal paste will almost always be
left behind in the cracks but do try to
make sure that all of the contact points
are fresh and scrubbed clean anything
that is contacting directly with the CPU
should be as clean as possible
now again rub with the metal to make
things easier
and eventually it should all be removed
once you're ready to apply new thermal
paste to the CPU and cooler it is
important not to overthink it
some tutorials will suggest using a gift
card to smooth out the paste or a credit
card don't do this as it can leave
behind air pockets which will actually
impact the cooling effectiveness of the
compound instead it is recommended that
you put a blob of the thermal paste onto
the CPU and the in the dead center when
it's and when the cooler is clamped onto
the CPU it will spread out nicely so
clamp the CPU into the socket of course
and make sure your backplate is in place
if you do have a back plate for your
cooler once it's all clamped down if you
you're gonna put a blob of thermal paste
onto the CPU it should be about the size
of I don't know about half the size of a
penny let's say use this video for
reference we're going to use the
pressure applied by the cooler to
naturally spread the paste around on its
own so apply the compound centrally
clamp the cooler into place and and of
course secure it nicely and and don't
over tighten it but secure it firmly and
you're done that's it it should have
squished the thermal paste around
underneath it no need to lift it off and
check as that will that will eliminate
the purpose of doing a lot of this so
just trust that it has spread around as
long as you put down enough you may need
to warm up the thermal paste first in a
cup of warm water if you have thermal
paste that is very hard to work with so
let's talk about understanding thermal
compound
first of all too much compound can
actually detract from its effectiveness
the entire purpose of thermal paste is
to fill air pockets in the metals of the
CPU and it's cooler and adding so much
thermal paste that it significantly
increases the distance between the CPU
and cooler will be detrimental and by
significantly increases I mean this is
not something you can necessarily see
with your eyes but if you put down
enough that it packs down and and comes
out of the sides of the cooler for
example that is too much so just keep it
small and simple about half the size of
a penny or a pea something like that a
cheerio it is actually better to have
too little thrown face than too much as
it can decrease the ability to properly
cool as I mentioned you want the copper
of the heat
to spread across as much surface area of
the CPU as possible and the thermal
paste act as acts as a filler excuse me
additionally not all thermal paste is
made equal some will have thermal
conductivity that is better than others
higher is better so as you see here the
antec thermal paste has significantly
higher thermal conductivity then the
stock paste that came with our cooler so
do keep that in mind as you are
selecting your thermal paste and that's
pretty much it you will find the full
article accompaniment accompaniments in
the description below wow it cannot talk
today so be sure to check that out for
further details on graphics which will
further explain how with their own taste
works and if you have any questions at
all please comment on the linked article
as i'll be more likely to see it and
answer them or feel free to comment
below and I'll keep an eye on it so I
will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
