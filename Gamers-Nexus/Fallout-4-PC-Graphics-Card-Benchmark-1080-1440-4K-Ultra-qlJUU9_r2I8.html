astana and this is our fallout 4
benchmark so we already posted the GPU
benchmark on the website and that has
all the FPS metrics the charts vram
memory consumption things like that you
can find that links in the description
below but this is the video recap of
that and first of all we already posted
a bench course for Fallout 4 so this
course basically runs through one of the
more intensive areas of the game and
creates a mix the GPU workload so the
objective of this course was to stress
the GPU pretty heavily at the beginning
and end of the test but create a more
realistic representation of the game
walk around less intensive parts of the
city during the middle of the test and
that creates a mixed workload so we have
the ability to look at the worst case
scenario and sort of the average slash
best case scenario in the middle that is
on the website and on the channel
already and it was rendered at 1080p but
the test was actually conducted in all
three resolutions and the video for the
bench course was recorded at 4k so it
was down sampled to 1080p when we
rendered it out because of some
limitations in YouTube regarding the
framerate can't do 60fps and 4k so
that's why that happened let's take a
look at some of the settings before
diving into the FPS results and fallout
4 so fallout 4 has a good amount of
settings but it is built on the same
creation engine as used for Skyrim and
previous Fallout games this means that
the eye and eye tweaking is the same as
previously for the most part there in
some new and some removed
ini lines that you can add or remove
from the text files but overall it's the
same idea where you can modify fallout 4
perhaps to I and I and other fallout 4
ini files to do some tweaking and then
other than that when you launch the game
you're presented with a splash screen
it's got the options page and in that
setting window you can change your
graphics to different levels obviously
so this is what that looks like and
we've got a full description of what all
these options do on the website just at
a top level if you're curious about what
any of one of them does in particular
fallout 4 has simple settings overall
and it's big on view distances because
it's
open-world game so part of the reason
aside from software optimization that
fallout 4 gets hit hard for fps in some
areas is because of the far drawing
distances especially as it pertains to
things like shadows object detail and
items of that nature an FPS first person
shooter like black ops 3 might look
better and hosts objectively superior
engine and graphics technology as we
found in our article on that but it does
not draw nearly as far as an open-world
game will do so you have to keep that
perspective in mind when looking at
these benchmarks if you're trying to
compare it against other games because
it's not necessarily a linear comparison
we found in some loose preliminary
testing that shadowdistance creates one
of the biggest hits to FPS to the tune
of about sixteen point seven percent
between its lowest and highest highest
setting so that is one of the first
items to tune if you're running into
issues with game performance our
graphics options are defined in the
article in the description below as is
our bench spec and complete testing
methodology including answers to your
driver questions a quick recap on the
test methodology though and videos
unreleased fallout 4 drivers were used
for testing those drivers are now
available but they were unreleased at
the time of testing and those include
fallout 4 optimizations the latest AMD
Catalyst drivers 15 dot 11 badda were
used for testing and game settings were
configured to ultra with ultra overrides
were not selected medium and low presets
were also run at 1080p and then Ultra
presets were run at 1080 1440 and 4k
resolutions once we determined which
settings provided a reasonable level of
load for appropriate video cards we
forged forward testing those
configurations on our suite of GPUs and
we also asked AMD if they would have
fallout 4 specific drivers to which the
company said that they weren't ready yet
so we ended up using the 15 dot 11 beta
until a point at which and the release
is updated drivers each scenario was
tested for 30 seconds identically then
repeated three times for parody we
tested in diamond city
the first major Township that the player
reaches and we found parts of Diamond
City to produce highly intensive load
with a performance gap as wide as nearly
60% in some instances this makes time
city a somewhat poorly optimized region
of the game that represents a mixed
workload scenario which is excellent for
testing our test run begins with the
camera pointed toward a heavily occupied
region of the city and then moves around
a much less intensive corridor
the result is a mixed GPU workload that
is 100% reproducible and representative
of real-world play experiences
benchmarks that don't precisely emulate
our course will have different results
so when you look around at other sites
running these benchmarks do keep in mind
the test methodology matters there's can
be correct for their particular bench
course but ours may be different because
we do some specific things in our bench
run that may not be emulated in other
tests as far as our preliminary and
somewhat unofficial V RAM and RAM
testing we looked at some of the V RAM
and RAM consumption just to understand
the nature of the beast it wasn't really
the intent to do a super accurate
published bit of information on this but
I'll go ahead and put this out there
anyway
fallout 4 commits about four point eight
gigabytes of virtual memory and uses a
working set of about 2.4 gigabytes so
that's physical Ram consumption of less
than three gigabytes and then total
system Ram consumption including virtual
memory of about four point eight to five
gigabytes as for vram the same 1080 max
settings that we used for testing the
quick memory consumption pushed around
2.6 to 2.9 gigabytes of vram at any time
using 1080 max and then you consume more
for 4k obviously so do keep that in mind
as well some quick anti-aliasing testing
was done to look at the performance hit
by taa which is Beth as does fallout 4
highest anti-aliasing setting we saw
that in our bench course the impact was
about three percent so we decided to
leave taa on for ultra test even at 4k
and the reason I point this out is
because a lot of the time with 4k you
don't need anti-aliasing because it's 4k
let's get into the charts here 4k is
effectively unplayable on single GPU
solutions when using ultra settings but
is achievable by dropping down a tier so
too high or medium high the 390x
gtx 980 and 980ti all struggle with
the 980ti pushing 46 average FPS and 46
is near playable and fallout since it's
not like a competitive FPS game where
speed is of critical importance when it
comes to framerate
we found that around 50 fps feels pretty
good for Fallout 4 though obviously
wanna be closer to 60 and that's where I
present interval will kick in and cap
you moving to 1440 as expected and these
shows it's difference-maker in the
higher resolution tests the r9 390x
lands fittingly between the gtx 970 and
msi gtx 980 fallout 4 is reasonably
played at 1440 on cards of equivalent or
superior class 2 the r9 290x and gtx 970
the r9 285 and gtx 960 cards are unable
to withstand the cycle and bandwidth
saturation of 1440 so we have to look
towards 1080 for that as for 1080 let's
talk obvious things first and I'm gonna
read this straight from my article just
so everything is very clearly explained
the 1080p GPU benchmark as you'll see
places a gtx 970 above and r9 390x by
about 5.1 percent which doesn't
necessarily seem right but in some other
games this happens as well though rarely
and we did not expect this to happen in
fallout 4 so I set forth to validate the
findings spent a couple hours trying to
figure it out and we thought we'd
located the setting creating the 970
lead when tweaking each option and
eventually noticed that shadowdistance
impacted results by nearly 20 FPS for
these particular two cards and that's
enough to close the gap but then when I
tested this on the 970 as well it
reproduced the result so the 970
maintained its a couple FPS lead over
the 390 X when setting the other
settings down lower the gap was still
the same and I've recently found that
volumetric lighting can be toggled in
ini files so I'm going to try that next
but overall the 390 X is outperformed by
the GTX 970 and the same 5% gap is
present throughout all the tests that
we've run at this particular resolution
and setting and things like that this
leads me to believe that the gap is
either a game optimization issue or a
driver optimization it
and we contacted AMD as I said late last
week in search of the four day one
drivers but we were told that the
drivers weren't ready yet so we ran with
fifteen dot eleven beta which just came
out for black ops it is possible at 390
X will outpace the 970 at 1080p with a
driver update or game optimization patch
but as the data stands right now that's
how it is and then finally here are some
medium and low settings benchmarks just
to quickly put those out there for
anyone who has lower and the cards but
at the end of the day the thing with
fallout 4 is that it does not look
impressive but that doesn't mean it's a
bad game certainly aren't everything and
we say this in our review where we
actually liked the game quite a bit
Michael Kern's reviewed it for the site
and you can read that on the website
gamers nexus net where he says that he
really likes the game despite some of
its quirky bugginess has his common with
bethesda titles and the odd graphics
optimization and graphics appearance in
general the aesthetic overall is good
and fitting of the Fallout series but
the graphics just aren't technologically
impressive so what video cards are best
we discussed this in the article but to
quickly recap the r9 285 and gtx 960 are
both decent performers depending on what
you're looking for and the 285 is
effectively superseded by the r9 380 so
we're eye buying a card to play at 1080
and close to ultra or at Ultra I would
go for the 960 or the r9 380 those are
the two options that will provide the
best price to performance ratio and
those are about $200 so that's kind of
where I would land for that unless you
want to go overkill and spend more money
but in terms of what's required the 380
and the 960 makes the most sense
looking at 1440 the 390 X is really the
best price to performance here it has
solid performance at higher resolutions
like 1440 it outperforms on videos
similarly priced at 970 at this range
and that's probably where I would steer
toward unless I specifically wanted a
970 in which case that's the only real
and video option in terms of price to
performance and then the 980 will get
you a bit closer to the higher frame
rates that you want which is a $500 card
so that's kind of where I am with it as
far as 4k goes it's really not
at Ultra settings with a single GPU
right now so you've got to either look
toward multi-gpu solutions or you have
to look toward dropping your settings a
bit down to high or medium or something
like that or mix of high and ultra so
that is all for the fallout 4 benchmark
