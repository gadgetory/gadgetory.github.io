form-factor CPU cooler that uses
whirling metal blades for an internal
fan of sorts though the fans
theoretically also serves as additional
service area for heat sinking and
dissipation the hope is that cool air
enters the top and gets forced outward
to a more traditional heat sink
theoretically permitting a smaller
physical footprint while retaining
competitive cooling performance to
traditional fan and heatsink designs
today we're reviewing the thermal take
engine 27 and its sandhya / cool trip
inspired engineering first this coverage
is brought to you by XOR diem games and
their indie game bear with me a more
themed adventure that tells a sarcastic
dark and nonlinear story with playable
sidekick teddy bear go figure the game
is currently 50% off on Steam at the
link of the description below the
original sandhya cooler had a different
design than the one that Thermaltake is
using though some aspects of it are the
same in the sandia model rather than
having a centrally mounted fan made out
of aluminum they spun the entire
aluminum heatsink so the entire set of
fins just spun in a circle with no
traditional fan centrally or otherwise
the cooler also used a hydrodynamic air
bearing and it conveyed the did the heat
transfer across an air gap basically
this was not something that ever really
came to market in a consumer or CPU
cooling usage we have never had our
hands on one cool chip also worked on
this design and works with thermal take
on the engine 27 so this is the closest
thing we've got to it right now and the
idea would be that in the original model
use the entire heatsink as a fan and
therefore have greater surface area
and theoretically you eliminate some of
that thin layer of air that accumulates
around the blades of a normal fan and
heatsink setup so Dante has taken the
piece that got the most heads turning
the rotating aluminum blades and stuck
it in a more traditional heat sink using
119 L shaped aluminum fins in the outer
layer and 40 aluminum fins in the inner
layer with a kinetic bearing and an 8
pole motor internally the motor does
mean that you'll have to divide your RPM
measurements by 2
get an accurate reading bios doesn't
quite understand what it's looking at
this is the exact same thing that you'd
have to do with most liquid cooler pumps
to determine their real rpm as they also
have double the poles of what is
expected for PWM thermal takes engine 27
is $50 and it's 27 millimeters in the
height as indicated by the name engine
27 the cooler is one of these select few
that would fit in something like
Silverstone's at Pt 13 case or the
petite series cases which are really
slim small form-factor HTV see boxes
that would be what you would use
something like this for it also means
that depending on how high you're
willing to go in terms of cooler height
the competition is pretty slim something
like Silverstone's MTO 8 115 XP right
here is 32 millimeters in height so even
this is larger than the engine 27 and
fitment is not actually going to work in
the PT 13 which demands a 30 millimeter
cooler or thereabout so there are a
couple of interesting scenarios for
testing this because we've got to take
height into account the silverstone MTO
is 7 would be the next smallest that we
could consider at 23 millimeters but
overall the engine 27 and its fan is
meant to be used in small form-factor
boxes where you wouldn't be stepping up
to something like a cryo rig c 7 at 47
millimeters because that's clearly going
to be better than both of these but
we'll be looking through all of those in
our thermal testing today taking the
thermal take engine 27 apart reveals
that there's a fixed base that doesn't
spin connected to the cold plate and
outer fins via a thin layer of thermal
paste the base then transfers the heat
to the rotating fins as you would expect
but is also still transferring the heat
to the outer thin as for the rest of it
thermal takes website uses a thermal
image to demonstrate the temperature of
the CPU cooler and the surrounding
motherboard components let's momentarily
ignore the flawed approach to pointing a
thermal camera at a heatsink and just
talk about scales in charts we're going
to remove thermal take scale and show
you the image with no scale the
direction we get from this is that the
VRMs are hot a towel as you'd expect
maybe eighty to ninety c while the
cooler measures just 35.6 c let's have
the scale back in its twenty three
thousand to forty five so probably
ambient to
45 Celsius for some reason so what
looked like a potential 50 C difference
is actually a 10 C difference and is
totally insignificant and again ignoring
the fact that pointing a thermal camera
at a heatsink is pointless anyway at
least this kind of heatsink we still
don't know anything either testing we
don't know what motherboard it was so we
don't know the vrm spec and more
importantly it's an irrelevant
measurement that means nothing the fact
that a CPU cool or a block of aluminum
appear is cooler assuming they've done
the thermal imaging correctly and taking
all the parameters into account like
emissivity and reflectivity and all of
that
assuming that why what does it tell you
it tells you that the block of aluminum
is cooler than who knows what
motherboard components were surrounding
it so that is exactly what you would
expect and it would look the same if we
took an image of this cooler or pretty
much any other cooler now again this is
just a fundamental misunderstanding with
thermal cameras we don't know the
temperature of the CPU just because we
can point a camera at the cooler and get
the temperature theoretically of the
blades so this is a marketing image and
you should ignore it completely and
instead defer to our testing which is
actually useful getting into this review
we're abandoning our standard cooler
test bench in favor of an ITX pacific
bench these small form-factor coolers
can't handle as much heat as the big
stuff so with a TT engine 27 were rated
for about 70 watt TDP CPUs because of
that rather than use something way
beyond spec like a 6700 K we're opting
instead for an i3 6300 CPU and an ITX
motherboard because ultimately this
cooler is meant for ITX so we'll be
testing it on ITX components all the
testing methods are in the article
linked below as always if you're curious
but for competition we're testing
against the silverstone and t o8 115 XP
and the cryo rig c7 coolers both of
which are also small form factor the
silverstone unit measures at 33
millimeters tall with cryo rigs quite a
bit larger than both thermaltake and the
silverstone at 47 millimeters tall this
means that cryo rigs will undoubtedly
outperform
both the others and that lower rpm but
provides a smallest to largest look at
performance across the stack as always
for all the testing methodology check
see link to the article in the
description below which also contains
the full review where we talk about all
this stuff in text form if you prefer
that the measurements use our delta T
over ambient so this is not sort of the
exact temperature of the diode or
package readings it's a delta T value
which we've explained in the past
it's to help equalize some of the
testing and that is all in that article
linked in the description below if you
have any questions at all we're only
showing three coolers right now as ITX
cooler testing is new for us the cryo
rig c7 lands at the top of the bench
with a load temperature of about 53
Celsius delta T as coolers also 47
millimeters tall or 20 millimeters
taller than the engine 27 and 15 taller
than the nto ate at a loud 3600 rpm
Silverstone's
n t o8 operates at around 57 H Celsius
delta T load with idols around 7 Celsius
the Thermaltake Engine 27 at 2500 rpm
its max speed keeps temperatures in
significantly warmer at 59.6 celsius
delta T load none of these are
particularly impressive but they are all
more or less equal when considering that
the lesson2 cooling performance and
potential of a small form-factor cooler
priority 7 bandages to properly
differentiate itself with a more
noteworthy advantage in cooling and one
which is attributable to its larger
stature and superior heat sink but
Thermaltake and silverstone aren't too
far apart and those are the head to head
competitors in this bench and they are
the numbers that matter most purely from
a competing size perspective Silverstone
and Thermaltake are the ones worth
highlighting right here we're setting
each cooler to run at an RPM that equals
a noise output of 43 DBA this means that
the Silverstone cooler operates at 3300
rpm and the sound will take engine 27
operates at 2500 rpm so we'll highlight
just those two results 59.6 celsius
versus 60.1 that's what we come out with
and that's within our 0.5 C range
a variance on CPU temperature generation
and measurements for all intents and
purposes when equalizing the noise
levels these coolers are identical in
performance here's a chart showing all
of the noise levels the coolers tend to
be more effective in terms of cooling to
noise when around 40 DBA just by
coincidence with the engine 27
maintaining a some level of acceptable
performance when at 70 percent fan RPM
with a 36.5 DBA output you'll start to
struggle with higher workload scenarios
if you want all the noise levels for
everything we've tested here's a quick
chart for that you might want to check
the article again links in description
below for more times read through the
data because the watt but the testing
methods for these are comparable enough
that we can put them on the same a chart
really it puts into perspective how
effective a liquid cooling is given the
height of the cooling block assuming the
tubes and radiator can also fit in your
SSS box pretty uncommon but worth a look
one thing that isn't shown with our
noise testing we do just a straight DBA
test what we're not showing is a
frequency spectrum analysis which would
be useful admittedly but it's something
we haven't expanded into just yet at
least not since the fury ACT
this thing the thermal take engine 27
it's noise levels even when matched to
the silverstone are a lot more they're a
lot less tolerable put it that way
basically it's a matter of the type of
noise so the type of noise coming out of
the Silverstone unit even when they're
both at 43 DBA is a lower hum it's more
what you would find with any fan whereas
the type of noise coming out of the
thermal take cooler is similar to
Sandhya's noise that comes out in their
original marketing pitch video they did
where it's got that high-pitched whine
and they said it was a variance in some
pre-production saying whatever the type
of noise the same that's coming out of
this so it is a higher pitch noise and
that means it's less tolerable at least
to me that's a subjective thing I
suppose
in general we find that the lower hums
like out of this are a lot more
tolerable than what's coming out of a
high-pitched whining spinning set of
blades the engine 27 is a unique attempt
at making a smaller profile cooler it's
interesting and Thermaltake explains
that they worked with cool chip to
develop
27 strictly in terms of thermal
performance it's around where the
comparable size NGO 8 115 X Pele and
particularly when considering equal
noise output it's also over two times
the price with the NPO 8 at $20 and the
end twenty seven at $50 if you can fit a
forty seven millimeter cooler and still
have breathing room above it for the fan
cryo rigs c7 at $30 is the clear winner
of all of these coolers is just a lot
bigger and won't fit in a slim htpc like
the PT series Silverstone cases
ultimately the engine 27 is in a bad
cooler it performs about the same as the
Silverstone n t o8 especially again when
accounting for the noise levels so
there's no crime against humanity for
making this thing the only thing that
this has working against it well there's
two things one is it's priced
significantly out of its performance
bracket so at over two times the cost of
an equally performing Silverstone cooler
which is a traditional fan and heatsink
arrangement it's hard to justify
spending fifty versus twenty in this
case there's also the high-pitched whine
which if you lower your fan speed and
you don't run it 100% all the time it
kind of goes away so it's going away
around seventy to eighty percent but you
will start having issues with really
intensive workloads if you need that
100% fan speed and are also trying to
avoid the noise so really specific set
of requirements there but this is a
really specific type of cooler so if you
are interested in more ITX cooler
reviews like this one let us know in the
comments below this is something that
we've got at least three we can put out
immediately and might look into more as
