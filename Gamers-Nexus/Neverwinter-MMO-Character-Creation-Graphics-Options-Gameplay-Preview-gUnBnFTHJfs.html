nexus dotnet and today we are looking at
neverwinter the beta of the new D&amp;amp;D MMO
so this is not DDO this is not
neverwinter nights this is an MMO based
in the neverwinter universe which is of
course Forgotten Realms for those of you
familiar with it now I'm going to do a
very quick overview of the video the
graphics options because I know a lot of
you are PC hardware enthusiasts if not
all of you at this point and just to
sort of recap everything here you have
up to 8x anti-aliasing which is fairly
standard it's actually kind of on a nice
hand for an MMO the lighting quality is
only lower high so not too amazing for
your options their shadows can be low
medium high or off and then you can set
maximum number of Lights per object
which is of course going to affect your
ability to render the the more advanced
lighting scenarios and shader quality is
also there so a lot of these are slider
based you can adjust the world texture
quality in percentages so this is very
Ram intensive it's actually because of
the recording I may reduce this but one
thing I can't increase the world detail
distance right now but I imagine it will
go to two hundred percent as well in the
future you'll see that the the terrain
detailed distance which is your level of
detail at at farther view distances the
terrain detail goes up to three hundred
percent you've probably noticed the
character detailed distance is two
hundred percent and world detail which
is your world structures like buildings
is one hundred percent right now the
reason if you're curious terrain detail
goes farther is because you're going to
be loading that train prior to loading
the objects there in which kind of makes
sense if you think about it but it's
also just it's friendlier to your system
resources got some more details for for
higher detail objects you can toggle or
to say or unable to disable them based
on your distance post-processing FX is
all there high medium low for visual FX
quality bloom is just most of you are
familiar with bloom of course we can't
see it on the screen
but bloom is just the way the world the
game interprets the the dynamic lighting
with respect to for example take take a
lake right you have some kind of fog
over the lake and that fog will be
dynamically lit up by the Sun or
whatever light source you have in the
game that's what bloom is in control if
you don't want to go too much over one
hundred percent because it look really
washed out so then some lens players and
that's pretty much it moving on we have
character creation which is of course
much more interesting too many of you so
we will create one on the Dragon chard I
already had a character there but you
have your basics and then a coming soon
over here who looks like a Sith Lord so
I imagine we will have tea flings
halflings and Sith Lords when the game
is done obviously male female characters
you have humans dwarves male female
elves male female halflings t flings and
the loser half elves who aren't quite
anything down here you see our abilities
or modifiers that ship with the
character this is all dandy 4th edition
based I believe there may be some next
stuff mixed in but I don't know I
haven't kept to up-to-date with the in
the past 3.5 and the beginnings of 4th
but this is 4th edition based for those
familiar with the tabletop game you have
different bonuses that make sense for
each race of course Elvis or more agile
humans are more mid-range dwarves or
sturdy halflings also agile and sturdy
or courageous i should say t flings
infernal and half elves again losers so
let's create I haven't yet created a
eh I haven't created a dwarf character
yet so let's make one of those let's hit
next you'll see here we have it defaults
you to the class that thinks is best for
your race which if I can interject here
I personally think this is a terrible
idea I understand why they're doing it
but wanted encourages min max in which
is incredibly boring and to it
everyone's gonna have like the same
templated characters templates are
they're so boring for mmos and really it
kind of breaks the immersion so I mean
what are you gonna do right the other
option I guess is default to the first
one and that's just not going to work
because not everyone will choose wrote
but regardless we have fighters who are
just tanks each of these has a Paragon
path just like in 4th edition there I
think there are three subtypes of each
major archetype this will probably be a
magic user so fighters you have rogues
ship with stealth bait and switch which
is a basically you put down a decoy and
jump backwards and then the enemies are
tricked into attacking it and then you
have some other stealth based skills
clerics of course healers and speak with
the astral realm they have shipped with
a flame strike ability and are able to
interact with religious symbols in the
game there are different elements which
the fighter is the best example because
he has Dungeoneering there are different
elements in the game that certain
classes can only interact with just like
D&amp;amp;D the rogue is the only one I believe
that can interact and disabled and
detect traps without you actually
stepping on them to that detect them the
fighter likewise is the only one that
can interact with dungeon Irina objects
which are normally lower based or
otherwise helpful for getting some kind
of special advantage or loot or whatever
in the dungeon let's choose let's choose
fighter just for the sake of doing it so
now we can roll our ability scores like
indeed indeed so you get to pick your
two options you can choose a racial
ability plus two Constitution plus T
strength or plus two composted wisdom
for those not familiar with the dungeons
and dragons rule set strength governs
your ability to hit things and deal
damage also lift some objects
intelligence governs
you're effectively magica for the Elder
Scrolls players it's your ability to
cast spells effectively Constitution as
your ability to take damage it affects
your armor class or your armor points
however you want to call it it affects
your health wisdom governs some skills
like as this says perception which is a
your ability to spot or listen to things
so very useful if you're rolling spot
checks silently this isn't done in front
of the player you're rolling spot
checked in the background to detect
certain things dexterity governs your
agility and in your armor class as well
and ability to use some weapons
effectively like bows and charisma
governs the bluff and other speaking
skills and this in games that doesn't
translate quite as well as the tabletop
game but I would imagine that there are
some kind of bluff like faint attacks or
something like that skills involved in
the game now we don't care about krismo
we'll go with that so now we have preset
appearances these are all very ugly as
is common with dwarves I suppose so you
have a couple of presets and then of
course you can customize so if you hit
customized you get here and you can
choose different shapes forward full
focus turn snarl and complete with
missing teeth let's go with that one
that one for the purposes of this video
and then hair you can choose all these
different options there they're the same
they're identical for every race
including tea flings so you're not
missing out or gaining certain options
based on the characters race and just go
through all of these there's a there's
Einstein door for you let's choose that
one next we have eyes these are these
will vary based on race unlike the hair
oh yeah you can choose color as well so
let's stick with that one eyes can
choose glowing natural blinds blind left
blind right hurt hurt left and hurt
right and we're just going to go with
the
go with glow eyebrows pretty
straightforward for this this race for
dwarves will just go with that and then
you get the beard options so for
halflings you can only have either plain
or mutton chops right now two orbs seem
to be the most filled out in that regard
as would make sense I would imagine that
these will change as the game is
currently only in beta let's go back and
correct that color will go there
complexion this is just effectively how
old your character let's go with that
this is only 40 flings the section
tattoos there a couple of pretty cool
ones one of them looked a lot like arena
kisses facial scars that I saw earlier
let's go with that just because it's
kind of crazy looking go with the do a
green or something and then scars
straight forward as well doesn't need a
lot of explaining scaling this is kind
of cool you can scale just about
everything on your characters face with
sliders just like in single player rpgs
and some other MMOs so pretty pretty
cool stuff if you care about that I
personally do not i'm going to leave it
alone you get your your body archetype
so to speak so for dwarves they look
pretty much the same even the slim one
we're going to go with heavy though and
then finally body scaling which lets you
also scale more individual aspects of
your character so that is pretty much
the deal with character creation there's
really not much more to it than that
other than this screen which is your
origin these are different cities or
valleys or areas within the Forgotten
Realms universe I'm I'll be honest I'm
not quite sure what time period
neverwinter online is supposed to take
place previously the games they've been
all over the place that I think even
driz de peered in one of the games for
those Philip those familiar excuse me
with the Deward and family we do see
mithran or still exists so it's before
the myth strin or module that existed in
the second edition if anyone played that
but anyway you choose your starting
location so you can tell you the forest
of Cormier
and or baldur's gate more familiar and
then you get to choose your organization
or affiliation with in that category and
this really just affects your character
background I don't know that it affects
your skills too much I could be wrong
but I don't think it does so you see you
have a little bit of background here
generates for you it tries to give you
some purpose in the game because as we
will discuss later in another video you
really don't have much purpose it
doesn't give you a point it just says
okay here's a tutorial go play so not a
lot of introduction other than this text
making it pretty important then you have
your deities like saloon of course the
moon goddess and who else we have here
that I'm familiar with there's coral on
the Elven god I believe coral on Laura
the--and i think is his full name and
then chante the what is she the god of
livelihood and farmers more than of
course being the traditional dwarven god
and then there are a couple others here
i guess that's trade whatever however
you say that sounds like an work God
almost and then tempest of course is
also very popular let's just go with
morgan hit continue this is your summary
screen and you get to do your character
name and all that type in a brief
biography if you want in the next video
or in one of the other videos i don't
know which will finish up hooding first
you will see the gameplay and first
impressions and in my own overview what
i think of the game has a whole so check
that out for more this was the character
creation and video settings for
neverwinter online and with that i will
see you all in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
