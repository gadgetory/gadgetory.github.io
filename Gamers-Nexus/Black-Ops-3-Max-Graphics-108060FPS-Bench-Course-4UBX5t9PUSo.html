net and you are watching our maximum
graphics benchmark course of call of
duty black ops 3 this is the course that
we executed when benchmarking black ops
3 zat graphics with our huge video card
sweet we tested several configurations
and that benchmark is already live on
the website if you want to see the FPS
results of various GPUs but you'll find
our video version of the benchmark going
live later today so stay tuned for that
now black ops 3 is a really interesting
game because there are a lot of caveats
to the performance and this won't be
noticed unless the bench markers which
in this case is us perform a significant
amount of time testing all the different
game modes and the different areas of
the game and try and find where is this
then the most realistically intensive if
you're an end user if you're actually
playing it not just benchmarking it so
we found that the single-player campaign
was actually far more intensive to the
tune of about thirty eight percent in
some cases than multiplayer and this
factored into our decision to do a
unique multiplayer benchmark course so
this is actually a multiplayer map we
found through testing that the presence
of other models character models did not
have that big of an impact on FPS it was
more the environment objects the shading
the pixel effects all that stuff that
had the bigger impact on FPS and so we
created an easily reproducible test
using a multiplayer map which produces a
higher FPS then you would get in single
player by again about thirty to thirty
eight percent in some instances but
being that it is called duty we just
sort of figured while most field
probably interested in multiplayer so
we'll benchmark that and you can read
more about this methodology and the
whole test in the article on the website
gamers Nexus dotnet or just subscribe
and check the video later today after I
get some sleep from benchmarking the
game all night as always if you like
this kind of content please check out
the patreon link in the post well video
below but that is all for this time I
will see you all soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
