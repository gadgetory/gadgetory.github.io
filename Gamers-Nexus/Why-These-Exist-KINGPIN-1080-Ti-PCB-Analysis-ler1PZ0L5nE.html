we're going to be taking a look at a
very special GTX ten atti PCB this is
EVGA Kingston edition named after the
extreme overclockers kingpin who works
at EVGA and whoa does it show that this
card was designed with full intentions
of running on liquid nitrogen and
smashing world records especially 3d
mark well we'll go into why you know
this card is so very ELINT like extreme
overclocking centric we'll start with
the usual the VR ends before getting to
that this video is brought to you by
ifixit.com and the pc essentials toolkit
which can be had for $20 making it one
of their cheapest yet most complete
toolkits use code gamers nexus for five
dollars off to bring that to 15 you can
go to ifixit.com slash gamers Nexus or
click the link below for more
information starting with the largest
the vcore vrm located right over here so
that's V core that supplies the power
used by the GPU core and it is the most
important we are em when overclocking on
liquid nitrogen and while other sub
ambient cooling methods so that's one
behind that we find the memory of erm
and the memory of erm powers all of the
gddr5 X chips around the GPU core and
those are basically the two largest VRMs
on the card all the other ones from here
on our minor ones that you don't really
have to care about that much starting
off with this one down here this is one
way to describe this is the vrm that
powers the V RMS so this is known as the
variable gate Drive basically its job is
to convert 12 volts into a voltage
between five and ten volts though it
theoretically could go lower but you
wouldn't do that because this VRM
produces basically produces the voltage
that the vcore vrm and the memory vrm
used to switch their MOSFETs on and off
then this over here is the other another
one of the minor of erm this is the one
volt PLL
/alright /px voltage this voltage is
like you don't actually need to run this
one on liquid nitrogen it is however
very very helpful but you can get away
without it
of course this card right here has
voltage control available for that we'll
go into more detail later in the video
about that and then up here we finally
find the 1.8 volts VPP for the gddr5 X
so this is a supporting voltage for the
gddr5 X memory basically this voltage
used to be in internal to previous
memory systems except it became external
on gddr5 X as having it external
improves efficiency so yeah and this
voltage doesn't actually do anything for
overclocking so you don't have to worry
about it
so one thing before we get into the
details of the PCB here this is a
engineering sample PCB first of all you
can tell because it's a revision zero
point zero the other thing is there's
lovely things like this hand soul during
right here and the this right here as
well as all of the debug headers right
over here so basically there might be
some very minor changes from this PC via
from this PCB to what you end up seeing
retail but the V RMS in the feature set
will not be changing so let's start off
with the largest one the V Corps v RM it
is a one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten phase based on the
inductor count which if you've watched
past videos of mine on you know looking
at PCBs you would know that you can't
actually buy a 10 phase voltage
controller so this card is running a
doubling scheme and it's doubling up
five phases from the voltage controller
right here and those are doubled up
through international rectifier ir35 99s
which you have one here one here one
here another one there and another one
there so that's five of them in total
and ir $35.99
our our doublers and or quadruple errs
they can do either of those two
functions as a trade-off these are one
of the more basic doubler types they're
not they don't have some of the advanced
features you can get on some other
doublers out there which do actual like
current balancing between the two phases
that they're hooked up to so as far as
the actual voltage controller right over
here is concerned which that is a IR
3595 as far as that is concerned this
vrm is a five phase it cannot
individually there's no individual
regulation for the actual separate you
know ten phases that the vrm ends up
with however these phases are
interleaved so you do get some of the
benefits of a ten phase just not all of
them that's that's sort of the thing for
example you do get the increased power
throughput the better thermals you get
slightly better voltage regulation
because there's less current going
through each phase and since it's
interleaved even even if it's badly you
know not super accurately interleaved
you still get interleaved inter leaving
over the phases and that leads to
basically the VR I'm putting less strain
on the power supply as well as as a side
effect you get better voltage regulation
so you know it's better than any any
five phase it should be better than a
six and then if it's better than a seven
phase or an eight say that really
depends on the details of the
implementation so the our error 3595 is
a six plus two phase voltage controller
EVGA is not using the part plus two part
at all and the six is downgraded to the
five which then gets multiplied by two
by the ir 3599 and then that you know
gets you your ten phases so that's how
the vrm is controlled i've already said
you know what the doubling scheme that
EVGA is running here
does the 3595 has a switching frequency
range of 200 kilohertz all the way to
to megahertz however the $35.99 over
here only goes up to 800 kilohertz
output and the stock switching frequency
on this vrm is 400 kilohertz so alright
a bit is a higher switching frequencies
and some uh
than many of the other cards as
typically you'll see cards shipping with
sort of 300 colored switching frequency
however to be absolutely certain I would
have to have to have cards in hand to
check what their actual switching
frequency is with like a Scylla scope or
because most of the existing ten ADT
eyes use analog voltage controllers
based on how those are wired because the
frequency is set by a circuit so you can
basically check that circuit to figure
out the switching frequency oh yeah
that's the control scheme I in terms of
power quality especially considering
that you know the capacitor selection
and capacitor positioning and that kind
of thing also plays a very large role in
getting a good stable voltage level is
really hard to say how this vrm would
compare to other V RMS also with the
1080 Ti not being exactly a huge
power-hungry monstrosity like say the
980ti and other previous architectures
where own liquid nitrogen you could
easily see a single GPU pulling as much
as a thousand watts under load so I
don't see a problem with running a ten
phase yes did a higher phase counts
could possibly deliver a better voltage
stability however on a 1080 Ti I don't
really think it would actually have any
meaningful impact on overclocking even
on liquid nitrogen so yeah that's sort
of so I don't really have a problem with
the control scheme that EVGA has going
for here obviously it could have more
phases that could also be a waste of PC
board space at this point now for the
actual power throughput we're looking at
international excess power of fire power
stages and these are IR 3575 these
things
are pretty much the best power stage
International rectifier makes these are
60 amps rated 11 lots of heat output at
that current level and a operating
temperature of 125 degrees to achieve
this rating so this V R M right here has
a theoretical maximum current throughput
of 600 amps with a heat output of 110
watts and that would be like an overload
scenario so this would blow up the vrm
pretty much instantly but you're not
going to hit that
so the V R M is plenty powerful for
feeding a 1080 Ti and under normal
operating conditions this v RM will
actually be in it's sort of P in well
just past the peak of its efficiency
curve as at 220 amps power draw this erm
will be just about just around 21 watts
of heat dissipation and that includes
driver IC losses because these are power
stages so all losses are calculated like
in that power power loss value is
complete whereas for other V RMS I
usually just look at how much power is
lost on the MOSFETs themselves not on
the actual driving circuitry of the V R
M as well which won't be a huge amount
but you know it also pulls power and you
can't really ignore it especially
considering how most 1080 T eyes have
pretty good V RMS to start with so the
differences aren't you know tens of
watts it's a couple was here a couple
watts there but this is by far one of
the most efficient 1080 TI V RMS I
remember looking at anyway so yeah the
other cool feature of the 35 75 ignoring
it's ridiculous power draw and it's a
power capability and efficiency is the
fact that it has this metal heatsink
piece on the outer casing so basically
this is a metal bit of metal that goes
straight to the actual silicon inside
the MOSFET and this really improves with
keeping internal temperatures on these
down which improves lifespan and
reliability so yeah there is a reason
why these are
International rectifier is best and
since these are power you know power I
our power stages from international
rectifier these also feature body
braking mode as well as a diode
emulation mode which are both well body
braking mode is a really cool feature
for load release voltage stability so
basically when the card goes from very
high load to very low load body braking
mode can be used to really mitigate any
kind of big spikes in voltage very very
well and the 3595 here supports that the
3575 support that the 3599 also supports
the body braking mode as well so
basically the vrm can use it and the
other thing is diode emulation mode is
basically just a super high power like
it's for super low power usage the vrm
will basically stop charges stop using
power to turn on the low side mosa if
you ever pull that little current to it
which won't actually happen because the
vrm here instead of having multiple
phases turned on at the same time the
3595 can switch phases off on and off
dynamically so if you're at idle it
won't actually need to run the entire
vrm so it probably won't ever enter body
braking mode because as long as it like
the voltage controller can pretty much
keep the vrm at peak efficiency under
any kind of load conditions so that's
you know yeah it's a very nicely curved
erm as you would expect of a card with
the king pin name on it
so yeah moving on to the memory vrm this
thing is ridiculous overkill for memory
but it is nice to see so and it also has
some weird things so the memory of erm
right here is a 1 2 3 phase design it is
controlled by this voltage controller
because if you remember this was a plus
2 and we're not even using that and this
voltage controller right here is an ir35
7d and this goes again 200 kilohertz to
1 a 2 mega
but this is a three plus two phase
voltage controller and EVGA is not using
the plus two part they're using the plus
the three part because they want three
phase memory power this can actually
like three phase memory power is really
overkill but it can actually help with
overclocking range on memory so I don't
think it's needless what is kind of
needless is that EVGA has opted to yet
again use ir35 75s end result is this
memory vrm has a theoretical maximum
current throughput of a hundred and
eighty amps assuming you have you know
ridiculous cooling capabilities the
side-effect of that however is that the
memory vrm under normal load conditions
and even overclock you won't really see
the memory of erm really ever exceed 30
amps of current throughput this thing
will only ever put out about two to
three watts of heat so this thing will
run ice-cold the memory of erm on this
card will run absolutely ice-cold
even without the heatsink and you know
EVGA with their new IC x coolers are
just going absolutely insane with heat
sinks so the view memory of erm has a
you know it is heat sinks anyway even
though I honestly wouldn't bother
because these are overkill really really
overkill for the application you see
here there's you know there's 1080p is
out there with single-phase memory VR
ends with no active cooling on the
memory of erm at all so yeah really
really overkill the three phases improve
you know voltage regulation on the
memory as well so yeah it's a really
nice memory VR I'm interesting little
thing to note is that the memory of erm
is main capacitor bank is actually
located all the way over here which is
just kind of cool and worth pointing out
because it is kind of interesting
because this right here is the ground
plane and then you can see that you have
the memory power plane sort of going
around all the memory chips like that so
yeah these capacitors right here are for
the memory of erm and it makes sense
that they're located over here because
generally with decoupling capacitors and
filtering capacitors you want to put
them as close to your load as
possible and the load for the memory of
erm is of course the memory chips
themselves so putting them right here
makes sense a lot of other manufacturers
to basically get the capacitors close
enough to the memory chips what they'll
do is they'll like crams of memory VR em
up here or in this area or they'll mess
up like they'll split some of the phases
off of the vcore vrm shifted down into
this area so that the vcore vrm is sort
of longer in its layout but EVGA opted
for a kind of interesting layout with
having the capacitors really far away
from the actual chokes of the core of
memory vrm right here so yeah now let's
move on to the minor of erm the cool
thing about all of the minor of erm the
VPP the PLL and the Varg variable gate
drive erm all three of these are using a
fully integrated buck converter which is
an IR 38 99 this thing has a maximum
current throughput of 9 amps and 9 amps
10 volts yeah 9 amps 10 volts output
it's going to produce about 2.4 watts to
3 watts of heat so basically this thing
is plenty powerful not nothing to worry
about in terms of you know powering the
PLL or the VPP or or the you know actual
vrm itself so the vrm selection that
EVGA has gone for here is excellent
which you know you wouldn't expect
anything less of a Kingston branded card
so now let's get on to the actual sort
of cool lnto overclocking features
because it's one thing to make a GPU
that doesn't blow up like well one thing
to make a card a PCV that doesn't catch
on fire when you put it under liquid
nitrogen as in you make the VR I'm
strong enough to not get destroyed when
you really really push the card the
thing about that is is that's relatively
easy basically anyone can make a really
large massive erm strap
big eats ink on it and get a good
current rating now admittedly the better
manufacturers will actually do that
while maintaining good efficiency levels
and that kind of thing but generally
anybody can achieve that the harder part
is making a card that isn't a massive
pain to work with and that's a lot of
what EVGA sort of like that's what makes
the kingston cards really special for
extreme overclockers because the kingpin
cards are one of the few lines of cards
if not the only line of cards where you
can buy one of these and assuming you
have faith that the card didn't arrived
it wasn't dead on arrival you can buy
insulate and run on ln2 without doing
anything else to the card because you
have software and hardware support for
everything you could need and that is
achieved by the basically voltage
controller selection as well as all of
the extra headers you have around this
area of the card so the 3595 3570 these
are both fully digital international
rectifier voltage controllers so they
can be controlled through software and
both of them are controllable through
this USB header that USB header gives
you voltage control LLC settings
yeah I can't write that fast fault also
you get temperature monitoring for the
many sensors scattered around the card
and you also get well for the voltage
controls you actually get you get
obviously both of ecore in memory you
also get the 1 volt PLL which I did say
earlier is kind of optional for ln2 like
you can totally get away with running a
card with just v core control I've done
that I have a 1070 that I ran on ln2
that you know I only had a voltage
control for recore because I could not
be bothered doing all the other mods
around the cards so like I would need to
physically modify and basically if you
buy most other cards you end up having
to modify a ton of things and that just
takes forever it's risky it's a pain
sometimes you can't find data sheets you
know it really
makes everything a lot harder for for
extreme overclocking like you have even
very basic things like for example
clearance component clearance for
example this card right here there's
note all components anywhere in this
area which you know you might think oh
not really that special where well it
actually is because if I try to mount a
most ln2 pots have only a few
millimeters of clearance in this entire
area right here so you basically have a
rectangle where nothing taller than a
couple millimeters can be or the ln2 pot
won't fit on the card well it just so
happens that a lot of manufacturers like
to put memory VRMs right over here and
those memory VRMs end up with capacitors
sorta in this area so if you're an
extreme overclockers you basically end
up in a situation where you either have
to move components already on the card
around remove them and figure out
someplace else to mount them because you
need to have them you know usually it's
capacitors and like chokes so you'll
have to like be sold or joke and resold
or hit on the back of the card and you
better pray that your card is a
through-hole at that point because some
you know these are surface mount chokes
you can't actually move them they have
to be on the side of the card where they
were intended to be mounted so in
situations where you can't move the
components elsewhere onto the card
you're stuck running something known as
a base extension for an ln2 part which
is essentially just a chunk of copper
that sits between the ln2 pot and the
GPU core to give you extra height extra
clearance from the PCB for the lm-2 pot
and those ruin your thermal performance
like absolutely ruin it because that
extra block of copper includes an extra
layer of thermal paste to connect it to
the base of the pot and there's a
thermal place connecting the extension
to the GPU core so two extra layers of
thermal paste thermal paste at very low
negative temperatures doesn't really
like the less of you you the less of it
there is the better the less layers of
thermal paste the better like it's a
massive thermal insulator at very low
temperatures even the high-end thermal
pastes are the centimeter or so of
copper is a massive
thermal barrier it is so bad in fact
that if you go from like say for example
my GTX 970 idol I can have the card as
cold as minus 170 degrees centigrade
once the card goes under load it very
quickly climbs back up to minus 120
degrees and that's entirely because of
that block of copper just sitting in
there acting like a thermal insulator
between the GPU core and the ln2 Paul so
you know that's like a really basic
design thing for a manufacturer to take
care of you just don't put components
that are that tall in this area of the
car but a lot of cards don't actually do
that and then if you're an extreme
overclocker they're just not an option
for you this being a kingpin card
designed to run on ln2 only has this and
this which are like the only potential
clearance concerns and those are both
very low profile chokes so pretty much
any ln2 pot is going to fit on this card
which is really really nice if you're an
extreme overclocker so yeah so you get
the voltage controls the LLC the
temperature monitoring and then up here
you get more voltage control this time
through the evbot header this is a USB
as a USB header down there this is the
evbot header and the thing about the ez
ball is it's basically a dongle that
EVGA used to make for their cards which
you can plug in and get voltage control
and LLC settings and that kind of things
so basically it does everything the USB
port does except the evie ball is
unavailable you can't buy it it hasn't
been available for several years now so
that's kind of unfortunate but I don't
really see that as a problem since the
USB header kind of does everything that
you v-ball header does but for guys who
like using the EZ bought you know yeah
they can next to that we find these
three to channel dip switches which are
actually a permanent feature of the card
these disable various protections like
over temperature over current any kind
of limitations you can switch them off
with physical switches on the card so no
more limits next to that you find some
very basic troubleshooting LEDs so you
have a le
indicating 12 volts 3.3 volts PLL memory
GPU 12 volts 3.3 volts is basically
check your PCIe slot check your power
cables PLL memory and GPU if one of
those is not lighting up you have a very
very serious problem because it
basically means you're not getting
décor or PLL or GPU power I mean core
power memory power or PLL power and if
one of those is missing if your own ln2
there's a good chance some part of the
card is really really wet and something
it's not working because of that if
you're not on lnto the card is probably
dead so yeah but it does save some time
with troubleshooting because if you're
trying to post and you're not getting
any display output for no apparent
reason you know you can just quickly
check if the card is even getting power
properly so these are kind of useful for
troubleshooting that then up here we
find the probit belt basically this is a
there's a little header that goes into
that with a bunch of wires coming out of
it those are terminated in a it's not an
alligator clip but it's basically a
terminal that you can plug digital
multimeter probes into really really
snug I have a few motherboards that come
with something very very similar
these are awesome I love these and these
are extremely useful because when you're
running cards on eloquent nitrogen you
can't really afford title you can't
really run monitoring software on the
system you're doing your extreme
overclocking on so you can't monitor
voltages in with software so you have to
rely on digital multimeters and for most
cards that means you're going to be
soldiering on your own probe points
because after you've insulated a car you
can't exactly go and stab the legs of a
capacitor while the card is running 3d
mark with a hunt with ln2 needing to be
poured so this is very very handy and
again it just saves time from the usual
ritual by the card test the card mod
everything on the card and then finally
run it so yeah this is a very nice
feature then we have what looks to be a
third SLI connector it's not a third SLI
connector it's some super-secret feature
that EVGA won't currently won't reveal
what it actually does and next of that
we find a three channel
switch there's a regular bowels a backup
of the regular bowels and an Ln two
bottles I'm not entirely sure what the
Ln two bottles does but I imagine it
disables any limitations that you would
normally run into like like the actual G
Nvidia power limit would be listed and
that kind of thing so yeah the card is
fully you know it is very much one of
those cards where you can just buy it
test that it works insulate it and run
it on ln2 that's is really what makes
one of these cards so very very special
for for extreme overclockers because
most of the time you need to do a ton of
modding and you know sometimes you just
can't even do the mods because oh look
this component doesn't actually have a
datasheet that I can look up on the
Internet
so for extreme overclockers this card is
an absolute tree for for gamers and you
know normal people I feel like the the
ridiculous
just design and are like design and
engineering that went into this card is
is really really wasted but uh yeah you
know if you if you want like a formula
one that you're gonna drive daily this
is the card for you this is pretty much
a formula one because this thing it was
built to break you know but overclocking
records first and then everything else
was like well it can technically play
games so yeah I I don't really have any
complaints except maybe I smarter
doublers or more phases maybe like it's
not you know if they don't want to do a
twelve or fourteen or sixteen phase why
not just do an eight phase-- that could
have been another option but I totally
understand why putting a fourteen phase
or a sixteen phase on a ten a DTI is
just a complete waste of space because a
1080 TI will never pull that much power
even on liquid nitrogen
so yeah this is a very very impressive
card and it's a Kingston addition it
completely lives up to the name that the
you know the to the legacy that the
previous kingpin Edition cards have
established so that's it for this video
