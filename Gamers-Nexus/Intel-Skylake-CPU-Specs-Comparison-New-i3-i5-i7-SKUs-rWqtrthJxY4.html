net and we're doing a quick news update
this time on the intel skylake cpus the
remainder of intel skylake lineup has
been announced as of the last couple of
days and just a refresher the ones that
are already out would include the i760
700k which we reviewed and the i5 6600 k
both of these are as indicated by the
name case Q CPUs so they are meant for
overclocking they are the higher-end
cpus in the sky like lineup before
moving on to the sky like Extreme
Edition which is not yet officially
announced in any capacity so those are
the high end CPUs which are already out
and we've reviewed today the items of
note would be the i3 6300 series the i3
6100 series the I 566 and 6500 CPUs of
non k and the i7 6709 k CPU there are a
lot more cpus than these that were
announced including the core em series
the tcu CPUs which are a lower TDP
meaning lower thermal and power
requirement and those are interesting
but they're not really desktop use and
it's not something we're going to focus
on here today starting with the i3 cpu
is the i3 6300 drops to 47 wats TDP from
its predecessor the i3 4300 that would
be as well which was at 54 wats TDP so
that is a seven wat reduction in total
power requirement and it increases the
clock rate to 3.8 gigahertz from the
three point five gigahertz on the
Haswell equivalent so that is a zero
point three gigahertz increase or 300
megahertz the price should be about
identical we currently only have
wholesale pricing so this is not
direct-to-consumer individual box retail
pricing keep that in mind but for a box
of 1000 of these CPUs you're paying
about one hundred forty seven dollars
per I 360 300 so consumer price and will
be a little bit more than that because
there's a markup they have to make some
money but that's the general range where
you should expect them to fall for the
i3 6100 CPU the TDP is the same
reduction 47 wats from
54 wats oh that is seven wats again and
the clock rate increases also 300
megahertz so the same as the 6300 is 0.3
gigahertz increase in clock rates to 3.7
from 3 point 4 gigahertz on the previous
Haswell equivalent to the 4130 now has
well had a couple of interesting tweaks
that do not normally happen with Intel
CD launches and one of these was the
launch of the 4160 which followed the
4130 quite a while after launch actually
in the 41-60 increased the clock rate to
3.6 gigahertz from the original 3.4
gigahertz on the 4130 so in that
instance you're only getting a 100
megahertz increase on the i3 6100 from
the I 348 140-160 in this case the price
is about the same as the Haswell I
3-series CPUs at 117 dollars for a box
of 1000 so again add a bit for the
consumer pricing but that's about where
it falls moving on to the i5 CPU so
there's already VI 560 600k which is the
case Q CPU for the i-5 line up in sky
lake and the K just means as many of you
already know that is overclocking ready
so they've got very granular support for
base clock increments in the sky lake
architecture and then there's also
unlocked multiplier increases so you can
increase the clock of the case Q skylake
CP is quite a bit by using the base
clock and the core clock multiplier
jumps and bios for the 6600 9k cpu TDP
drops to 65 watts from 84 wats on the
preceding haswell cpu equivalent which
would be the i5 4670k me and after that
came the i5 4690 which as many of you
likely recall the 4690 the 4790 both of
these came with Devil's Canyon and that
was a refresh on the existing Haswell
architecture so it wasn't a new
architecture but it wasn't overclocked
pre overclocked refresh of has well in
both cases the TDP drop is about this
from 84 to 65 watts and the clock rate
increase on the i5 6600 from the i5 4670
three point three gigahertz bass 3.9
gigahertz turbo on the new one from 3.4
base and 3.8 turbo so there's a small
jump it's only 100 megahertz or so and
that's nothing to get super excited
about but of course there's a lot more
to these CPUs than just a clock rate
there's cash changes there are memory
changes so the biggest one is obviously
ddr4 from ddr3 that is quite a big
change and that will impact production
very heavily if you are a production
user so don't just take the clock
numbers and base a purchase on those
because there's a whole lot more that
goes into it but for the purpose of news
the jumping clock rates pretty small and
for gamers that is one of the main
things you're looking at is core count
and clock rate then cash is pretty
important as well but ddr4 support it's
it's good not something that's necessary
for the pricing you can expect around
the same price of the 4674 the new I 560
609 k CPU with a box of a thousand at
202 dollars for the wholesale pricing
and retail prices are yet undetermined
the i5 6600 drops 0.2 gigahertz below
the i5 6600 k the case Q so it's a 200
megahertz decrease in clock rate and you
lose some of that overclocking support
but it's expected to be about twenty
dollars cheaper so if you are absolutely
uninterested in the case Q overclocking
which is perfectly valid then you can
save twenty bucks by going for the 6600
9k which again very valid and that's
about the price that we saw the previous
non k CPUs offered at so it's really no
big change there for Intel as far as the
included coolers that is one item to
note with Haswell you did get an
included cooler with skylake thus far in
the case Q there is no included CPU
cooler so you do have to factor in that
cost though really at that point you
should be buying an aftermarket cooler
anyway for the i7 6709 k cpu that
TDP drops to 65 watts from 84 just like
the previous model and that is from the
4770 and the 4790 both I seven core cpus
and both has well the 4790 being devil's
canyon the clock rate is about the same
at 3.4 gigahertz on the 4770 and the
6700 and 3.9 gigahertz turbo with both
of those the price is 312 dollars for a
box of a thousand so it's expected to be
about the same price as the previous of
non case Q I seven CPUs as for the
difference between these 6700 and the
6700 k that is actually pretty
measurable it is a 0.6 gigahertz
decrease for the non k version of the
6700 cpu so that is a 600 megahertz
change pretty big and that's the base
frequency but the 6700 is expected to be
priced around forty dollars cheaper than
the 6700 k so that's quite a big
difference in price when you're doing
really any kind of mid-range build or
thereabout and that's something that
should be considered if you are not
planning to do any overclocking
whatsoever because you're not
overclocking they do been out a bit
better for the case Q CPUs but it's a
big price savings so that is all for the
Intel news with the new CPUs that were
just announced Core M CPS were also
announced as were the TCP is but we're
not going to cover those because they're
not really core desktop user products
they're more for power saving users
business users and folks like that the
laptop cps were also announced but
something we will go into separately hit
the link in the description below for
the article on all this with the charts
if you want to just see straight charts
the data and if you like this type of
reporting as always check out our
patreon page in the post roll video and
that helps us out a lot we're gain
subscribers there pretty quickly it's
very exciting to see so that is all for
this time i will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
