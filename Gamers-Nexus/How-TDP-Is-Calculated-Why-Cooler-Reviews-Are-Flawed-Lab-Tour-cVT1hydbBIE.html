China looking at one of cooler masters
testing facilities so we've already seen
some other stuff I don't have it on the
channel yet but we're looking at today
they're the two aspects I really want to
address here one of them is basically
all cooler reviews are flawed and this
is something that we talk about in our
cooler reviews they're flawed to an
extent we'll go over why here this this
equipment more or less demonstrates it
and then also TDP what we're talking a
bit about both of those subjects before
that this video is brought to you by the
gigabyte r-tx 2070 gaming OC now
available in a matte white model to
match the emergence of white PC cases
the RT X 2070 gaming OC is a three fan
cooling solution and four composite heat
pipes on Nvidia's newest Orion GPU and
ships with a pre overclock of 1740
megahertz in OC mode or 1725 in gaming
mode RGB fusion is also available for
the LED enthusiast learn more at the
link in the description below I guess
we'll start with this right now there's
a hyper 212 hooked up behind me here so
this is set up and what this chamber is
doing is pulling an air through the
bottom so there's actually a giant
blower fan here and the goal of this
test I'll walk through more of the
specifics in a second is to look at the
thermal performance so it's not a
obviously perfectly real world scenario
so you're not getting the real-world
performance that would be affected by
for example the Tim between the IHS and
the die so that's not accounted for here
but the point of doing something like
this which is the same reason we do sort
of really controlled tests in our own
lab is so that you can get consistent
numbers where you can compare one device
to the next so if coolermaster works on
another products may be following the
212 then they have some data they can
compare to you from previously so that
there's there's ups and downs to it
there's some real-world tests and we'll
show it to but the way this works is
looking at some of the thermal numbers
that are on the screen here from a
previous test run you can see that
ambient temperatures here it's hooked up
to a k-type thermocouple will show
momentarily so ambient temperature you
have the operating temperature of the
hot plate there's a thermocouple
sandwiched between the hot plate and the
the cold plate of the cooler and there's
actually a milled out hole for that
thermocouple to go into which
another thing we've talked on the past
Intel's T TVs do similar things to this
but it allows you to get some more
direct temperature readings so there's
no CPU required here which is actually
really good because and this is why
cooler reviews are often pretty flawed
because once you introduce a motherboard
and a CPU you're introducing potentially
dozens of different voltages most of
them on auto because people don't really
control properly and that changes the
performance every time so every time you
boot cycle if there's a reset somewhere
in BIOS then it could change the the
voltages to really small points your
fractions of a volt which will impact
the results but also there's impact from
things like for example past application
or whatever but anyway so this machine
we have the readout is fifty one point
three five for the current test the
hyper 212 and all the different readings
here and we can show this more in b-roll
but all the readings here give things
like the temperature of I think we have
ambient I think we have water
temperature or something like that so
there's actually a tank here that's used
for controlling humidity levels and this
is a water tank and it's hooked up so
that the humidity inside of the chamber
can be more or less simulated to the
humidity inside of a room that might be
under target testing depending on what
kind of humidity Coolermaster wants to
test for but so that can be controlled
and also another reason that cooler
reviews can be flawed because we really
we don't have any control over this
without a thermal chamber so it's only
so much you can do in a review to where
you get down to maybe a three degree
difference and at the end of the day a
three degree difference could be past
application it could be torque on the
socket
it could be humidity it could be ambient
temperature so all these things are why
if you're really making the products you
need real testing equipment like this
and the way this works is like I said
there's a blower fan the bottom it pulls
the air in and the air enters in on this
side of this particular chamber comes
through goes through some flow
straighteners which are just big mesh
wire is sort of in the middle of the
chamber we have some of this at home too
for our own airflow testing so it goes
through flow straighteners which make
sure that the air doesn't diffuse and
just go all over the chamber and as it
goes through the flow is straight
it eventually gets through all the way
over here and as you can see there are a
couple of pressure sensors hooked up and
these are tracked via software as well
so pressure sensors give us the air
pressure you could get CFM if you're
testing a fan for example there's
another test setup with that so you get
cubic feet per minute airflow and that's
calculated because you have a known
volume so you need to know in volume of
the chamber to get that and the air
comes out here and we can do the thermal
test or on the other side of if we show
it you can do the air flow testing with
the fans then moving on to this side so
this is where the air is actually coming
out and it's it's a bit warm here
because it's going through like I said
there's a hot plate on the bottom and
this is ultimately if we really in-house
wanted to do as perfect thermal testing
on colores as we could you'd have to do
something like this the problem is that
for us we start deviating so much from
real-world that in in a review for a
consumer it's not quite as useful
because as a consumer you're dealing
with again things like the the IHS or
the thermal interface between the IHS
and the dye and so even though this
cooler might be doing 51 degrees here
the hyper 212 this is 200 watts in the
hot plate for the earlier testing even
though it's doing 51 degrees for the K
type that's sandwiched between the cold
plate and the hot plate in reality with
a CPU vac number could be much higher
and it's it's going to vary depending on
the CPU as well and how well the dye
contacts IHS contacts the thermal
interface contacts the cold plate so it
gets really complicated and that's why
the real-world tests that we do are of
course to some degree flawed as all
review tests are but as long as you know
the flaws and you of course talk about
them and educate the audience it's fine
it's just that we wanted to show this
side of things where it's a more
perfectly controlled scenario so that
you can get some really good comparative
numbers and data and then you just
extrapolate to real-world as best you
can or you do real-world tests and we'll
look at that in a moment
so then finally over here there's two K
types hooked up and ones where I already
said it is there the second ones over
here for ambient temperature so you get
the temperature going into the cooler
and then the temperature of the hot
plate and figure out how how well it
cools so moving on we talked about real
world a bit and this set up over here
is representative of that so it doesn't
look like much but as I said you want to
eliminate motherboards where possible
and Intel for years now we've talked
about their ttv or their thermal test
vehicle we showed one of these in
Corsairs lab previously as well so it's
a it's it's it's a thermal test vehicle
that Intel provides and you can use it
for cooler testing it's extremely
controlled they also have some some
custom software they build for other
types of testing this is AM these so
quick note the thrown paste around the
CPU is just because it's been used a lot
but it's not it that's not how it's
actually supposed to be but that's how
ours looks to you so it's fine so this
is the AMD thermal test vehicle there's
a thermal probe up here probably just
for ambient you can move it around if
you need to change for the height of the
cooler and you can see that there's just
adjustment here so if you wanted to
change the height of that screw holding
the probe in place and that could be
done k types are hooked up back there so
that's more thermal probes you could
take I think actually there's a thermal
probe directly mounted to the top of the
and the rise in CPU there or the the
fake rise and see if you enter via the
thermal test CPU and then up here is the
benchtop power supplies these are used
to control the the wattage so if you
wanted to set a specific amount of power
going through the CPU you can figure
that out through just doing volts times
amps gives you watts so that's that's
the more real-world stuff this would be
used for sort of validating performance
for customers that people buying the
coolers it's no secret coolermaster
makes the AMD coolers so that's why you
see this here and then there's another
test vehicle over here so this one this
is pretty cool as well this is similar
in some ways to the one that we showed
first where it is pushing air through a
cooler and testing the cooler so you can
test for things like low impedance
caused by the fins that's a really
important point where as fins get denser
on a cooler you potentially encounter
the issue of the air flow getting
impeded to a point where there's
diminishing returns so ideally you have
you have the density you have the
service area without creating impedance
which could create things like
turbulence noise and actually worsen
performance so this is able to test for
that there's a cooler in there will show
in b-roll
and air is just pushed through it
and this is more or less to accommodate
different size cooler so you could work
with lower profile stuff if you're
working with like a longer cooler as
this one is or something with where the
height isn't as much of a concern as it
is with the other test chamber so this
is the last part of the lab we'll be
talking out this is the same machine
just mirrored from over there but it's
set up for different testing so instead
of a cooler mount into it it's got a fan
mounted to it and I guess I'll note a
few things here number one this is
Windows XP number two this machine is
$75,000 so you can put those two
together yourself so Windows XP
obviously very reliable if you've
already got your software set up why
change it and so this this machine setup
instead of using a blower fan to push
the air through and funnel it through a
cooler on the other side like was being
done over there where the air is getting
pushed through generated by a fan within
the system and then piped in through a
hose at the front instead of that
they're mounting a fan to the front so
it can be tested and if you're kind of
looking at the fan going well that's
sort of small compared to the volume of
the chamber the way the air is guided
through is there's actually another
blower fan down here which we have shots
of too and that one is working an
inverse from the fan of the front so
this fan at the front might be set to
something like fifty seven point three
fifty two point seven whatever it is on
the box for the CFM and then the fan
down here will mirror that and be set to
the same fan so that it doesn't impact
the result and but it does guide the air
through the system so that you can get
the pressure measurements as needed or
the flow measurements and then the
voltage can be varied so they can test
across different points of the curve
voltage curve or PWM curve to get the
performance that's a 30% dar pia or yeah
30% RPM or 50% pwm signal whatever it
may be and additionally the software can
aid in generating a PQ graph if you
wanted something like that so this is
more or less the cooler master cooling
test lab we wanted to show off for air
coolers you can use it for liquid
coolers but mostly for fans here we have
an air cooler mounted back there and
then the
real-world testing as well if you hadn't
seen the tea TVs before from AMD and
Intel then you've seen them now so this
this is exactly why it's so difficult to
do accurate cooler testing and this is
why we never say that our tests are
perfectly accurate what you really want
just to have a to address how testing
looks from reviewers standpoint what you
really want is a reviewer is to have
perfectly inaccurate tests so as long as
your measurements are imprecise
precisely then you're good by which I
mean if you're always off by plus or
minus two degrees that's fine it's when
you have extreme variance that it's
totally useless as a result and so we we
have some plus or minus numbers on the
bottom of our charts if you're ever
curious what the variance is and if it
difference is significant you can look
at that plus or minus so it says plus or
minus one degrees Celsius and you see
two coolers that are two degrees apart
they're basically the same statistically
we can't we don't have the test
resolution to see a difference now
something like this you might be able to
start seeing a difference of course but
I think that that addresses the cooler
test inside on the TDP side these
machines could also be used for
determining TDP so the test equipment if
you wanted to put a TDP number on the
side of your box just like this is used
to put a CFM number on the side of the
box you could do that through here just
like we showed the hot plate over there
with the cooler you could theoretically
produce a TDP number but everyone uses
TDP in different ways so intel's TDP is
different from how AMD calculates theirs
and i forget exactly what AMD's is but
it's based on like an optimal processor
temperature of sixty point eight degrees
celsius and based on some ambient
conditions and there's a lot of stuff
involved to create this formula to make
TDP so it's not necessarily comparable
from one to the next and then you also
have issues where if a company making
coolers puts on their box that it runs
that it can support 150 watt TDP and you
have a processor that says it's 150 watt
TDP those might not be the same thing so
that's that's important to note as well
so these could be used to produce a TDP
number but I believe for the assist the
fans we were looking at the coolers we
were looking at there's actually not a
TDP number on the boxer's potentially
the better way to go just because
otherwise everyone gets can
use that no one really knows what TDP
means so that's it for this one thank
