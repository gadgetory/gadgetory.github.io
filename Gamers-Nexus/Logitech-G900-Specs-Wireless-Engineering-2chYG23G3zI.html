dotnet we were at GDC 2016 I logitech's
sweet to talk about a new mouse call
it's a wired wireless mouse the g900
chaos spectrum before we get into that
all this coverage is brought to you by
raw Furies new gonner game chris i'm
joined by chris paid again you've
probably seen them before and we're
talking about the mass today so what's
the top level here so this is our new
wired wireless gaming mouse we wanted to
make a wireless mouse that was
professional grade so that pro gamers
could be comfortable using it in in
tournaments very cool and part of that
is the sort of weekender tournaments so
with a wireless mouse you've got battery
concerns how are you addressing that so
really people don't people have three
concerns when it comes to wireless
they're worried about latency they're
worried about battery life and they're
worried about weight right so we've got
best-in-class wireless performance and
we actually outperform wired in many
occasions we have great battery
performance you can go like it's at a
tournament weekend we have 24 hours of
run to die constant movement battery
life out of the box and you can get up
to 32 hours if you turn the lights off
and the last thing is the weight we've
made a lot of effort to remove weight
out of the product we got down to a
hundred and seven grams which is
significantly lighter than other
wireless gaming mice and as light as a
lot of wired gaming mice with wireless
one of the things that we constantly see
sort of people talking about what Mouse
they should buy it's always I don't want
to use wireless for gaming because it
dies or because the polling is not fast
enough or whatever with latency
specifically what what sort of your
latency expectation what are you doing
to you know reduce that concern so we've
been making wireless mice for a little
over 20 years now and we've been making
wireless gaming mouse for a long time as
well we have a lot of expertise inside
the company that allows us to create
very high-performance gaming mice in
Wireless we actually not only do we
outperform other wireless gaming mais
oui like I said in terms of cursor
motion sensor sensor reactivity and in
terms of button response time
we outperform a lot of wired gaming mice
as well with testing so a radio
frequency test or wireless testing this
is something we talked about pre
interview that was pretty cool and I
think people would be interested in
hearing what do you do on the test
inside to sort of bombard this thing
with different signals and create
impedance and what have you sure we've
got a full RF anechoic chamber in our
laboratory in Switzerland it's about six
hundred thousand dollars worth of
equipment in total we use that to
basically put the mouse in a totally RF
neutral environment and we spin it
around on a giant turntable thing and we
have an antenna that shoots a bunch of
RF signals at it so 2.4 land bluetooth
microwave whatever you want to whatever
you want to throw it and we've cranked
it up to the highest level possible we
have the the receiver put the receiver
about you know almost two meters away
from it and we get perfect performance
the entire time so to you've tested two
meters away from it what about the sort
of line of sight straight line testing
you know what's uh what should a user
expect reasonably in their house and
what's the long range that you've tested
so we've gotten it straight line no
obstacles up to 120 meters which is not
where you should be but even I mean
maybe if you're using a Jumbotron or
something but but probably You chef
computer computer next to you and use a
longer video cable but we put 10 meters
in the documentation it's it's it's it's
more than strong enough for any
reasonable kind of setup very cool what
about price on this we're looking at 149
so one 149 this is the RGB it's got RGB
lights and sort of interestingly we were
talking about how if you disable the RGB
lights you get about what seven hours so
out of the box like I said we'll do 24
hours run to die with the lights off it
goes up to about 32 so a little bit more
than eight hours more and then one of
the cooler things that I saw with the
software is the battery life indicator
calculator so what does that do so we
have a new tool in the software called
battery assistant what
that does is it allows you to look at
what the settings that you've got in the
mounts are actually doing in terms of
power consumption and lets you make the
choices that are that are appropriate
for for what you want to get out of it
very cool and I guess a couple final
features here closing out so the buttons
are magnetic right they can come off or
plates yeah so we've got we've got
removable buttons on both the left and
right side so you can remove the buttons
on the side and turn it into a truly
left or right-handed mouse or you can
put four buttons on either side or you
can put four buttons on it or no buttons
on it at your preference so you can have
it up to 11 buttons at the same time
these are held on by magnets in there
they're pretty durable they stay on
pretty well additionally we've developed
a new kind of click system for the left
and right buttons we in we in the G 302
in the g 303 we would put together our
metal spring button tensioning system
with the g900 we've actually gone a step
further than that we have removed the
flexing of plastic out of the equation
entirely and what we're doing now is
you're rotating around a metal metal
pivot bar which takes all of the extra
force required to deform that plastic
out of the click equation so all you're
doing is moving the microswitch itself
and then as the product comes off the
line in the factory we individually test
every single mouse to make sure that
those two buttons are within tolerance
to each other so everything has as close
to a perfect click as you can get so
that is the logitech g930 and wireless
mouse as the case may be one hundred
fifty dollars will of course post
reviews and other materials as as
possible here link in the description
below for more information thank you for
watching and we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
