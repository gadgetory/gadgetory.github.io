of Johnny guru currently at Corsair what
do you do at core sir I am the director
of power supply R&amp;amp;D so we're gonna be
talking about power supplies of course
and this I actually preempts something
pretty big for us that gamers Nexus
we're gonna start testing power supplies
pretty soon I've received some training
from mr. John Jareau you know now just
enough to be dangerous yeah that's right
and so the goal here is to talk about
why should you care about power supply
reviews there aren't a lot of them on
YouTube at least not ones that go into
depth with testing equipment yep so we
need to talk about why power supplies
matter before that this video is brought
to you by thermal Grizzly makers of the
conductor not liquid metal that we
recently used to drop 20 degrees off of
our temperatures Thermal Grizzly also
makes traditional thermal compounds we
use on top of the IHS like cryo not and
hydro not pastes learn more at the link
below
so the whole reason I got into power
supplies even though I'm not an
electrical engineer you know I have a
computer background first software than
hardware is because of the lack of
knowledge of what is in this mysterious
black box right you know so I I got my
hands on a load test or similar to this
many years ago because what I found out
was a lot of power supplies weren't able
to do what they said they could do when
you look at the label the power supply
and a lot of what the power supply could
do was also out of spec for what Intel
expects your power supplies to do and of
course this goes back to like 15 years
ago when you know a power supply that
had 150 millivolts a rip on the 12 volt
rail was not uncommon yeah if you're
paying like $20 for a 500 watt power
supply so yeah so I got myself a low
tester like this and started loading up
power supplies to whatever the label
said and blew quite a few of them up
fewer now than before because I think
everybody is now you know learning that
there's a lot of garbage out there so
it's it's been quite a quite a fun quite
a fun journey you know I mean we were
talking about if we kind of give
everyone a a spectacle to start with
yeah like catastrophic failure is always
a fun yes yes so on a power spike
catastrophic leaf
and you read online about a really good
example is for example the 24-pin if you
load say four GPUs into a motherboard
right and you start pushing 75 watts to
all the PCIe slots yeah something you
can melt the cables or some yeah that's
that's one of their most recent
catastrophic failures that we see
especially with all the cryptocurrency
mining is melted pins because PSUs are
pushing graphics cards running full load
24/7 and eventually you know that he
built builds up and those connectors
start to melt right they're just not
engineered to do that in most cases I
mean the power supplies can do it but
the problem is the cables
commonsense you would think would
dictate that you would want to spread
those loads up across multiple cables
and connectors but unfortunate there's
quite a few people in there they're like
I just want this to be neat clean I got
one cable that's got six connectors on
it let's use that and that's when you
run into problems yeah yeah so that's
that's one type power supplies can go
pop if yeah that's that's the really
dramatic ones that I usually wish I have
cameras running all the time on me 24/7
yeah and you never get used to it either
a power supply pops you will jump you
could be doing this for 20 years doesn't
matter every engineer in here power
supply blows up right through the roof
and and it's it's really spectacular
when you do see it because even in the
housing through the grille you're gonna
see those sparks shoot through like the
fan grille and stuff and typically
that's because you have MOSFETs that are
overloaded where they're on the PFC the
input voltage is just too low so you're
pushing more current through it can't
handle it it blows up or on the DC side
you're just pushing too much power
through it and it blows up and again
spectacular flash of light and a very
loud bang all right everybody in the
room you know there are skips a beat
yeah and you take a early lunch yeah
right yeah so what about for
overclocking something we do a lot of
run into things where for example it's
not uncommon to push 50 or 60 amps into
a video card right hopefully over
multiple PCIe K right of course one or
something right so when you're talking
about a situation like over
clocking in exiting spec and you're
dealing with a high amount of current
through a cable what kinds of points of
failure do you see there I mean wire
gauge yeah right yeah wire gauge is
really really important I mean we make
sure we specify wire gauge based on use
case you know but coppers expensive
right so you'll find a lot of power
supplies out there were the wire gauges
and thick enough to support sustained
loads of a high-end graphics card so
some of the some of the negative
feedback from that is that you know
obviously if the gauge is thinner you're
building up resistance the voltage drops
you know and and it's just everything
just goes haywire all right you know the
car doesn't get enough power your
efficiency drops the power supply
actually will potentially overload even
because it's trying to push power to
feed a card that's not getting as much
power as it needs because there's just
too much resistance in this locate wire
so it's just that that's something
that's really often overlooked but it
can really cause a lot of problems but
you know it's and again it's this kind
of the same problem as when you'd load
too many cards or too many riser cards
in the case and cryptocurrency mining
you know onto a single cable you know
it's too much power
it's being fed into a single wire at the
power supply and that's just gonna cause
so much resistance that heat builds up
I've measured like a hundred and sixty
degrees Celsius at a single connector
pin and then yeah you it's no wonder you
start seeing black plastic just off the
power supply yeah yeah and that alone is
once we get into power supply testing
fully that's something I want to explore
because we see a lot of I get tweets
from people all the time where we'll see
like melted connectors to riser cards
yeah and it's really not a big question
why it melted right it's surprising that
people actually are surprised that they
melted times when they do and and you
and you know it's funny is up until
recently when cryptocurrency mining
became so big for everyone you know
everybody wants to you know get on board
that train that I've really learned a
lot about the UL 94 V flammability
rating of plastic and the additives that
are required to put into the plastic so
it just melts it doesn't burst into
flames right that's yeah every day is a
learning experience right so what let's
talk about this thing
behind us yeah yeah so we have two units
we've got a power supply over there it's
a corsair HX 850 that's currently hooked
up to this which is an sm 8800 sun/moon
SM 8800 yep the auxiliary loads called
an SM 22 sorry 220 because you can't run
the 8800 by itself but what you have
here is four of the loads are actually
up here and because they had all this
extra real estate they give you a little
extra power meter here so you don't have
to have a separate power meter to
measure the power of the power supply so
what we end up with is ten loads here
six of them are 12 volt and then you
have a 5 volt 33 volt negative 12 volt a
5 volt standby and it will tell you your
voltages your wattage is on each of
these rails and then the current that
you have program into load tester and
then like I was saying about the extra
real estate up here for another display
this tells you your AC information so
you have your AC voltage wattage current
frequency that's all in there so you can
use that to calculate efficiency if you
look at like for example the DC load and
then divide but or take your AC load and
divided by u DC load than you right off
the bat you know you're raising yeah and
we can use one of these to do all types
of validation mostly checking to make
sure the label on the power supply is
exact accurate or truthful yeah and
there are also options like you showed
us a power good button yeah that shows
our good signal so the power good signal
of your power supply which is I guess
basically a response time it's yeah it's
exactly it's how long it's waiting for
the motherboard to feedback that it's
ready for power good right for power
from the power supply
sure and is that red back in
milliseconds like it's right back in the
so then I guess the implication is if
that number is too high the motherboard
might not hope it's too high the
motherboard misses it says well there's
just the power supplies not ready it's
ready much be something wrong the power
supply right and then other options so
we can program a load in here yep so we
can program for example you could put 20
amps on a PCIe cable or something if you
wanted to and basically the point of
that is to run through validation make
sure right yeah so you can either take
your loads and distribute it across the
six 12-volt rails and just to test the
capability of the power supply but also
you want to do something like you know
we're talking about what is the locate
ability or what kind of voltage drop are
you're gonna see on a single connector
if you load a single connector you can
load each of these rails up to you know
you can zero everything out and load one
up to like 40 amps if you wanted to
right just to see what happens if we
hook up and ask up to this as well yeah
we can start getting things like ripple
yeah you just hook your oscilloscope up
to here set it to measure AC and by
turning this dial here you're gonna be
able to measure the rip on each of the
rails on the power supply right right
and that I guess we should note why
ripple is important too because there's
not a lot of power supply videos on
YouTube so so ripple I'll say from an
overclocking standpoint that you can
tell you from an engineering standpoint
but from my perspective with ripple and
builds wide who works with us if you
start getting into a category where the
ripple is really high you can have
potentially stability issues or just
power delivery issues in general right
which is or both right or both which
again my experience practical experience
is more is more noticeable or observable
with a highly sensitive overclock or
something like that but how about how
about it does affect overclock more than
anything because it is so sensitive at
that point obviously Intel they only
want it to be within 120 millivolts but
horse Intel is working within the
specifications they designed their chips
for right but obviously I mean ripple is
AC current that is passed through to the
DC side and being that power supplies
are what they call switch mode power
supplies where you're switching the
frequency of the AC you're actually
creating ripple to the AC current and
then bringing it through the power
supply so it's even more of a problem
with switz mode power supplies than
anything else you know darn Tesla and so
yeah so anything that's not filtered by
the power supply because that's what
it's up to is is just the power supply
has to be able to filter afford sends it
out it's going to end up going to the
voltage regulators of whatever you're
running right right so this is a CPU the
GPUs and then like you were saying if
you overclock it it's even more
sensitive to that and so the more there
is to it the more has to deal with it on
its end it's much easier to deal with on
the power supply yeah sure because we
have all this space to you know throw a
bunch of caps in there filters a
throw it out as much as possible right
so if I'm reading reviews on power
supplies or watching them where do we
classify exceptionally good ripple where
it's as acceptable versus unacceptable
so personally I find acceptable like for
like Jo end user it would be like 60
millivolts 20 millivolts is usually the
goal for Corsair just so you know it
reviews well more than anything but also
you know we do sponsor a lot of
overclockers and and even the ones that
we don't sponsor they they like you know
I'll go to a show and they're using
Corsair power supplies because the power
supply is not part of the equation of
why they're having problems overclocking
you know whatever they're overclocking
because we do set such you know goals to
to bring rippled I mean something like
the ax I for example that ripples down
to 15 millivolts by spec you know so
different testers will get different
results but we basically we ax its
anything higher than 15 millivolts so
but like I said for Jo end-user 60
millivolts but you know really good
power supply should be twenty millivolts
and at what point doesn't does it become
noticeably unacceptable to an end-user I
mean when do you start really seeing
problems well to actually to an end-user
to be perfectly honest it's it's not it
shouldn't be it shouldn't be noticeable
what and one of the reasons why I got
into testing power supply is because if
it's really bad it is noticeable and
that the end result is killing
components so early on in my life and my
hardware life I was a head tech of Annie
Taylor and I had to deal with a lot of
RMA s and we had a lot of system
builders that would buy all their parts
from us but not necessarily the power
supplies because we only sold brand-name
power supplies they were too expensive
right right so they would buy like as
$20 power supplies and and then they'd
come back after a year and it's like my
motherboard is dead my graphics card is
dead they'd have swollen caps burn VRS
and I'm like what the hell is going on
because of immersion you ever have these
problems myself and you're coming in
here and like every motherboard you
bought from me is now dead after only a
year
and sure enough we tested them with a
low tester an oscilloscope and found
that the ripple was higher than 120
millivolts and the voltage regulation
was like all over the place it was plus
minus five
set which is within Intel spec but if
it's plus 5% within you know
milliseconds right you're driving those
voltage regulators on your board
absolutely nuts trying to keep up and
trying to maintain you know a stable
voltage right so to actually run the
computer yeah yeah that's a great
explanation
give me it so closing out here it gives
me a the if you're buying let's say a
moderately high end power supply and
you're looking around at reviews or
trying to figure out what you should
care about you how do you how do you
categorize the different performance
aspects of a power supply so on Johnny
guru you have the old rating system that
you used to use right you talked about
things like presentation I think you
talked about cable quality occasionally
so I mean first thing is always
performance and that's like the heaviest
weight of the score and that's going to
be your voltage regulation ripple
suppression but you know another thing
that you know we weren't able to test
for because these load testers are so
loud and setting up a good soundproof
room or a box or whatever it can be
expensive is noise and that's something
that is a big complaint with customers
right is the noise of person not just
fan noise but also coil whine to the
coil why it's hard to catch a be
captured because we're using different
technologies to switch these power
supplies in ways that they're more
efficient but unfortunately that
introduces more of that audible noise
through the magnetics on the power
supply and that's what's generically
called coil whine right
but yeah performance you know just
overall performance sound whether it be
you know coil whine or fan noise right
and then of course just feature set you
know does it have enough piece a he
connects how long are the cables are
they long enough for the case you're
gonna put it in single versus multiple
12 volt rail we were you know talking
about you know how multiple 12 volt
rails are a safety thing right and how
all of our power supplies that either
have a mechanical switch that switches
between multiple and single 12 volt rail
or you can switch in the software we
always have it a multiple 12 volt rail
by default right for safety for safety
purposes user wants to throw caution in
the wind and said it's single 12 volt
rail hey that's up to them that's their
choice but at least their machine is up
and running we know they didn't pinch a
wire inside the side panel of the case
and causing a short that would cause a
single 12 volt rail to overload and
start melting wires
well yeah art world you're a side panel
right so so those are the things to
really look for overall yeah and then of
course you know aesthetics are good you
know our big thing the cables how well
the cables can route and manage that's
when you get into things like fully
modular versus semi modular fully module
obviously easier to do cable management
right yeah yeah cool well if you want to
learn more about power supplies and
hopefully you do check back soon and
subscribe if you're not because we're
gonna be working with
I think this exact equipment or
something very similar it's yours
there you go check back soon for that
thank you John I appreciate it all right
thanks Dave we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
