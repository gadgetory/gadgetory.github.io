5 which finally ships for PC and it's
been a long time in development and the
reason for this development becomes
apparent when we look at the game
settings its graphics optimizations and
its overall performance on PC and that's
something we'll talk about in a few
moments here today what we're looking at
is the video card performance in GTA 5
when using a 4790k CPU so we're looking
at raw GPU performance for comparative
purposes and I tested everything from a
250 X all the way up to a Titan X and
sli gtx 980 s so there's a lot of
variety here in fact I've got so many
video cards around me right now I don't
really have anywhere to put my arms so
we have a lot of stuff and the game is
fairly interesting from a benchmarking
perspective and it's something we'll be
including in all GP reviews going
forward for the immediate future at
least and this is because it includes a
few new options in the settings menu one
of the most immediately useful outputs
in the GTA 5 settings menu is the video
RAM consumption or the memory
consumption made by your GPU dependent
upon the graphics settings currently
configured in the game so this doesn't
show the constant usage of video memory
but it shows the maximum theoretical
consumption of video memory as your
settings dictate if you lower the
settings in the game it will lower the
maximum the peak consumption of video
RAM and this is useful for configuring
options to make sure you're getting
optimum performance for the GPU you've
got and the amount of memory it's got
available to it so this game is one that
will run better in theory with 4
gigabyte or better video cards but we
did test it with 2 gigabyte and even a
one gigabyte card just for comparison
purposes to see how true that statement
is and whether you can get by on 2
gigabyte video card with GTA 5 we also
tested it at 4k 1440 and 1080 resolution
so big range there huge undertaking for
us those who are gaming on high
resolution monitors will definitely need
a higher end card because some of the
settings in the game are fairly graphics
intensive and will go over a few of
those now before getting to the frame
rate charts some of the biggest items on
the list are the three slider options on
the graphics settings tab which include
population density population variety
and then distance scaling population
density is the amount of NPCs and NPC
interactable objects drawn to the screen
at any given time so the higher this
slider is in the bar the more NPCs
you'll have rendered to the screen
this increases the geometry drawn it
increases the polygon count and and eats
into our poly budget and it also makes
more draw calls to the to the GPU from
the CPU so it places heavier load on
both the CPU and the GPU in this
instance increasing population density
will have a fairly noticeable impact on
gameplay as well because you'll have
more NPCs you can interact with but it
does eat into performance so make that
note population variety just educated
speculation here I have not confirmed
this with Rockstar I believe is the the
amount of objects and NPCs and things of
that sort
perhaps vehicles drawn to screen at any
given time before it starts repeating
objects and reusing some of those models
effectively recycling assets that are on
the screen so a higher population
variety will increase the immersive
nature of the game and then we've got
distance scaling in the graphics tab and
the expandable view distance in the
advanced graphics tab view distance and
distance scaling impact
the level of detail and the amount and
proximity with which objects are drawn
as you approach them so if you are
farther away from say this the downtown
area of the city and you're maybe
approaching in a jet and you've got a
shorter view distance you will not see
the city until you're effectively within
interaction range of the environment
it'll start rendering and buildings will
pop up and level of detail will increase
as you approach the city level of detail
much lower as you're farther away from
the city because you don't need all
those high-resolution textures and
finite geometry details when you're
farther away other settings include
shadow settings like Nvidia's P CSS or
percentage closer softer shadows and and
these contact hardening shadows or CHS
both of these technologies do
you somewhat similar things but have
different methodologies and
implementations in their approach CHS
will change the sharpness or blurriness
of the shadows edges depending on its
distance from the light in the game so
if the light source is farther away it
will impact how soft the edges of the
shadow of to be a bit more realistic and
believable P CSS does something kind of
similar and we've talked about it in the
past we've also got things like texture
resolution and quality of shadows and
shaders and these things don't impact
video memory as much texture resolution
has a huge impact on it let's move on to
the benchmarks and see what the actual
performance of all these video cards is
at 4k resolution using ultra settings
which I define in the benchmark linked
in the description below and the test
methodology we see that the two PNY GTX
980 s which are overclocked cards
outperform everything else getting 56
frames per second on average when 0 AAA
is applied and then following that is
the Titan X which is a $1000 video card
which performs at 40 FPS average in my
article linked in the description below
I explained that 40 to 50 FPS is
adequate for playing GTA 5 comfortably
and smoothly it is not the kind of high
precision game that demands 60 FPS
constantly so if you're at 40 or 50 FPS
you're in pretty good shape 40 is it's
getting a little bit close to the
dangerzone because when things get more
crazy there will be jobs that are
noticeable but 30 is not where I would
want to be the GTX 980 stand alone is at
30 so it's not great for 4k at Ultra
settings and then there are nine 290 X
falls below 30 FPS average and is not
really something we recommend for
playing 4k with ultra settings looking
at high settings though it becomes a bit
of a different story the Titan X is
suddenly pushing 63 fps so very playable
at high settings with 4k resolution and
still looks great too the GTX 980 for
gigabyte card runs at 47 fps and we did
not test the sli 980 s here because we
effectively determined that if you have
them you would not be playing 4k on high
you would be playing 4k on
try the 290x is finally a more playable
framerate at 39 we'd probably still drop
a few of the settings just a tick to
push it to 40 or a little above 40 but
still very playable at 39 for the most
part other than when it gets very crazy
moving on to 1440p we look at the GTX
980 s and sli at the very top with about
a hundred FPS on average followed by the
Titan X at 80 the 980 at 65 and so forth
at this point if you're trying to play
GTA 5 at 1440 resolution with ultra
settings we would probably encourage you
to purchase something along the lines of
a GTX 970 which does not appear in this
benchmark due to availability but would
perform similarly to the GTX 780 in this
benchmark so the 970 would be our key
recommendation therefore 1440 and then
on the AMD side the 290 X which is very
affordable these days is a very value
intensive competitor with Nvidia 1080
gaming with ultra settings really has
the top end cards blowing this game away
you should probably just play on a high
resolution or use vs RDS our virtual and
dynamic super resolutions from AMD and
NVIDIA if you have a higher-end card
because they can push it so might as
well but if you just want to play 1080
with ultra or very high settings then
you would do pretty well on a GTX 770
and r9 285 even a gtx 960 4 gigabyte
model or 2 gigabyte bottle do pretty
well with the settings as they are at
1080p you could drop them just a tad if
you wanted to improve performance
slightly of the 960 s and then anything
above that is getting to be a bit
excessive so we would recommend the 960
and the 285 at this price range if
you've got a 770 you're already in good
shape as for the 270x it falls a little
bit close to our limit for playable fps
so we would recommend the 270 X in the
instance you are playing 1080p with high
settings not ultra settings as you can
see in this next chart the 270x pushes
60 F gas at high with 1080p so very
strong performer at $140 it makes a good
price point the 750 Ti if you prefer
Nvidia and want to limit your TDP
requirements and your power cables and
make
run easier performs at 52 FPS so it's a
close contender to the 270x
and its price about the same and you
just kind of have to make that judgment
call on your own whether you care about
those extra and video features at the
end of the day the best video cards for
GTA 5 are fairly obvious based on these
charts the 970 is great for 1440p and
the 980 and sli or a Titan X would do
excellently for 4k at Ultra settings if
you are playing 1080p like most of us do
then you can get away with just about
anything that's in the mid-range market
so that'd be 200 or higher in terms of
initial buying cost the gtx 960 is a
very stable and reliable card with a lot
of technology on it that those who like
doing streaming and things like that can
take advantage of and then if you prefer
AMD or you just want the higher raw FPS
output at a similar price the 280 acts
would be worth looking at that's about
two hundred thirty two hundred forty
dollars depending on what you buy so
those would be my recommendations from
both major manufacturers on each side if
you want more detail I would encourage
you to check out the article into the
description below as it has the full
benchmark the charts the game settings
and all that stuff it's pretty cool if
you want to do the test yourself we help
you figure out how to do that so let me
know what you think about GTA 5 let me
know what you think about the graphics
in the comments below I'm curious to
hear if you think that this is a
direction we want to go in the industry
where we're finally utilizing PC
hardware to its fullest extent or would
you rather see resources diverted
