crossfire with the RX 480 is mainly
pointing to higher performance on to
four 80s which would cost 200 times two
to four hundred bucks or 480 bucks
depending and saying that was better
than it's single gtx 1080 which is of
course a higher cost product 650 to 700
dollars or more as we all know with the
current product availability so that was
the fanfare at the Macau event and later
at Computex with the RX for 80s Andy
used the game ashes of singularity to
benchmark that's the only one that we
saw in sort of a live benchmarking so we
bought our own second R X 480 paired
them together
we've got benchmarks for you here I did
more than FPS we did thermal testing
noise testing and power testing and
we've also got the usual FPS benchmarks
and you can find all of these linked in
the description below in the article if
you want full detail for things that
might not be covered in complete depth
here so first off when does crossfire
work well and why crossfire mostly works
in games where friends are not
interdependent on one another so games
where you have really heavy post FX
post-processing and temporal effects
effects that span from frame a to frame
be like temporal analysis of samples of
pixels for things like anti-aliasing
things like that those types of effects
and game environments do not necessarily
work well with multi-gpu setups whether
it's crossfire or SLI and this is
assuming sort of an Lda or maybe even
some MDA types of games so the reason
for that is because the frames are
interdependent so with AF our alternate
frame rendering gp1 renders a frame GPU
to renders a frame they put them
together they output it that's your
that's your frame rate so this is where
with post-processing you kind of lose
some of that performance and you can
actually have negative scaling and we'll
show that here so this table you're
looking at is our bench with all the
hardware that we use for these tests you
can find that again link to the
description below with the fold charts
first we'll talk about thermals so
thermals for multi-gpu configurations
can kind of go
through the roof with tight spaces
blower fans help a bit by nature being
more exposed to the air and Andy's got a
cutout in the back of their cards that
further helps with some breathability
we tested crossfire with our cards two
slots apart or one full usable slot
gapped and checked on thermals peak
temperatures and things like that this
first chart is a zoomed out look at the
frequency of GP 1 GP 2 and the
temperature of GP 1 which is the hottest
of the pair and this is an absolute
temperature so it's not the delta value
that we're gonna show in equilibrium
charts
note that the clock rate fluctuates when
exceeding actually the fluctuations
themselves exceed a range of 100
megahertz in some cases so we see a
pretty big swing and that can cause
spurious frame output and low frame
times when the cards are under more
duress and to offset this just like with
the Nvidia cards and the throttles it's
clock rate temporarily for a heavy
thermal reduction so this process it's
actually pretty normal between a.m. the
end and video and repeats ad infinitum
until you either stop gaming or things
have smoothed out but let's zoom in to
make it a little more clear what's going
on so we've distorted the scale here and
for good reason the temperature scale is
now 70 to 90 and that helps see the
spikes with greater resolution time
scales been restricted to 500 to 800
seconds rather than the fold 0 to a 100
notice that every temperature reduction
is accompanied by a brief frequency
reduction and the two are directly
related in their function in this way if
you look at them in the charts the
second card that seems to rounded a
lower frequency throughout the test and
isn't matching the frequency of the
first GPU necessarily and if we look at
our charts from the single arcs for a
tea review we see that similar frequency
and thermal values are being hit but the
our X 480 does a breathe better overall
and that's obvious because it's not
being blocked by a second card so here's
a chart looking at the quote unquote
equilibrium temperature values basically
average peak thermals for a single card
all the other cards and the crossfire rx
for a TS power draw of course is a very
important metric when looking at
multiple GPUs because even though you're
increasing your potential for
performance you're also drawing a lot
more power so this shows total system
power draw in volt amps or apparent
power consumption and that means it's
for the complete system not just the GPU
and what we're seeing is nearly four
hundred and thirty volts amps for the
crossfire our X 480 configuration and as
versus 240 on a single our X 480 and
then of course if you look at the
overclock power drop for the single our
X 480 we would draw way more power we
applied that to crossfire so you have to
take that into account if you're
planning to do crossfire with AIB
partner cards that are pre overclocked a
single gtx 1070 sits at 263 volt amps
and a single GT X 1080 sits at 280 point
six three volt am just for a comparison
moving on to noise we gained a couple DB
across the board with the crossfire
configuration we're at 38 point 4 DB
idle versus a single rx for ATS 37.3 DB
outputs 41 to DB Auto versus 39.4 DB for
the single card and then 44.9 at 50% vs.
42.8 also at 50% for the single card and
60 7.4 DB at a hundred percent which is
very loud versus 60 5.6 DB for the
single card also at 100%
so although the DB increase looks like
maybe one or two decibels in a lot of
cases and of course this is logarithmic
so it's not just a subtraction addition
thing although that is the case there's
a pretty annoying whiny noise that does
bring itself out a bit more with
crossfire at the hires fan rpms and
there's also a slight vibration that's
caused from turbulence between the two
cards it's not that annoying if it's
within a case and you're under 50% fan
speed you're probably fine but past that
point it does get to be a bit annoying
ok so enough with the power noise and
thermals now we're gonna get into the
game benchmarks these are not all of our
benchmarks you can find the rest again
in the link that's in the description
below
Mordor shadow of Mordor at 1080p ultra
we see a thirty eight point seven
percent increase over the single our X
480 the 0.1% lows are a little on the
low end but overall acceptable and this
pairing is three point nine percent
faster than a gtx 1070 the GTX 1080 is
eleven point seven percent faster than
the crossfire Rx for ATS moving the
1440p we see the poor 0.1% lope
introduced some noticeable stutters and
framedrops but we've improved our
averages overall and see a scaling of
72% over the single our X 480
performance improvement is about twelve
point four percent versus the gtx 1070
gaming X or eleven FPS average if you
want that number and that said the GTX
970 gaming act sustains a better 0.1
percent low performance and this is
generally a trend with multi-gpu
configurations versus single 4k pushes
the cards closer together with minimal
average FPS gaps differentiating the GTX
1080 and the RX 4 80s the gtx 1070 runs
at 50 1.3 FPS average but keeps
significantly better 0.1% low frame
times than the RX 4 80s in crossfire GTA
v was retested using these 16 not 7.1
drivers that results stuttering the rest
of these games were tested with 16,000
6.2 at 1080p at the very high and ultra
setting combination we use saw that rx
for 80s and crossfire performing at 106
FPS average with slightly lower 0.1%
lows than the single our X 480
configuration they're still positive
scaling on the averages since we've seen
the single 8 gigabyte card runs at 85
point 3 FPS and that's a scaling
improvement of 19.5% so not impressive
but definitely present and 0.1% low
values are negatively scaled with the
single card performing nearly 20% better
than the 2 R X 480 is strictly in 0.1%
low values at 4k with GTA 5 we're seeing
the crossfire rx for 80s pull ahead in
the charts and achieved parity with the
stack of GT X 1080 GPUs the crossfire Rx
for 80s are outpaced only by the AIB
partner gtx 1088 from msi and the sli
gtx 1070 s reference cards may be out of
black ops were clearly hitting a
throttle point at 1080p in the current
newest Call of Duty game for now anyway
with our top few cards hitting a wall
around 218 FPS there's obviously a
throttle point so black ops 3 remains
one of the better optimized games on the
bench and also has a history of posting
better and the performance than in some
other titles the crossfire cards tie
with the SLI GTX 10 70s at 1080p
creating a scaling of 39% over a single
rx 488 gigabyte card and that
a 130 2.3 FPS average for the r x 480 as
opposed to 218 on the crossfire cards at
1440p we see the sli gtx 1070 s leading
the crossfire our X 480 is by 3.5%
crossfire 1% and 0.1% low performance is
acceptable though is clearly lower
overall than the gtx 1070 and GT X 1080
cards despite maintaining a strong
average the crossfire configuration
shows an increase of 52% over the single
R X 48 gigabyte card
moving on to 4k this is actually
playable on crossfire for ATS though the
0.1% lows do dip low enough to produce
visible stutter when plane it's not
ideal but the average is positioned
between the GTX 1080 game and X and the
sli gtx 1070 s average FPS performance
is effectively doubled over the single
rx 488 gigabyte card but 0.1% low
performance remains comparable Mirror's
Edge catalyst uses a lot of
post-processing which is often
interdependent on frames and that's not
great for scalability on multi-gpu
configurations and we're actually seeing
negative scallion and Mirror's Edge
catalyst with a single arts 480 at 1080p
Ultra performing 35% faster than the
crossfire cards so this is an instance
where you would definitely want to
disable crossfire to play the game at 4k
high we're seen 25 FPS average for dual
Rx for 80s that's in crossfire vs. 33
FPS average for a single card so that's
again negative scaling granted the game
is not really playable on either device
at 4k high but the scaling is still
negative so it does illustrate that and
that's not what you want when you buy a
second video card we also tested hyper
and 1440p and you can find more
information on that below ashes of
singularities this games interesting
this one is optimized for MDA so we used
multi display adapter for this through
DX 12 and of course the X 11 does not
support that quite the same way as DX 12
does it's not optimized the same way
Asha's is where am these our x4 ATS
should it be expected to perform well
considering they're bombastic comparison
versus at 1080 looking purely at frame
rates we're seeing the same poor dx11
performance as we've observed on all of
AMD's currently tested cards on our
bench including the fury X r9 390x
and our X 480 but that subsides as we
switch over
dx12 this inflates and these scaling
numbers substantially given the poor
dx11 performance so they're scaling does
look much better than perhaps the actual
perceivable output is but it does help
that crossfire rx for IDs out match a
single gtx 1070 an average FPS at 1080
high and the two cards nearly achieve
parity to 480 as that is with the single
GT X 1080 single cards and against a
single R X 480 the crossfire
configuration runs 36.8% faster 4k high
post the crossfire rx for 80s at 59.2
FPS average for DX 12 or between the two
gtx 1080 cards and we land above the gtx
1070 gaming X and crossfire than
maintains a 41% speed increase over a
single our X 480 frame times are also
important to look at the average frame
latency at 1080p high has the RX 40s and
crossfire performing between the GTX
1080 and gtx 1070 and well above this
single our X 480 when looking at the X
12 is strictly the X 11 doesn't really
look good with the crossfire setup but
then again it doesn't look good for any
of AMD's cards on this bench and it
stretches am these scaling metrics given
the poor dx11 performance
here's a percent change chart to show
scaling from dx11 to DX 12 between these
cards and architectures the Talos
principle offers both the x11 and Vulkan
API benchmarks with dx11 we're seeing
clear scaling between the RX for 80s and
crossfire where's is the single card
option 1080p ultra post an increase of
45.7% for a comparison duel 10 70s
posted a performance improvement of
17.4% which that's of course not that
exciting but the story changes as we
look to Vulcan crossfire for ATS
actually posed lower Vulcan performance
than the single card then the single rx
480 of 71 point 6 FPS crossfire vs. 74
point 4 FPS for a single art X 480 that
makes the single card 3.8 percent faster
at 1080p moving to 1440p we see similar
results with the single 480 actually
about 2 FPS faster than duel for ATS and
vulcan using dx11
instead we see 150 3.6 FPS with
crossfire vs. 70 9.8 honest
card so obviously the API is not
favorable towards multi GPUs at this
time and that is more on the game side
so API matters and that remains true all
the way through 4k which is playable on
DX Alvin with crossfire but totally
unplayable when and volcán the division
is another game that shows negative at
crossfire scaling at 1080p high our
tests are showing a performance
difference of more than 10 FPS average
between the single card and dual cards
made worse by dismal 0.1% low values and
that makes the single our X 480 13.8%
faster than averages and 43.6% faster
than 0.1% lows and then the crossfire
configuration 1440p is again similar
with the RX for a DS and crossfire
dragon behind the single card setup or
56 FPS average versus 50 1.3 FPS average
and there's an even bigger gap in the
lows as we've seen in the last few tests
so that leads us to the question of
whether or not this is actually worth it
with crossfire cards and my answer is
the same as it's been for SLI x 70's and
sli everything else we've ever tested
for the most part SLI 9 70s we did as
well so this is is it's true for Nvidia
and for AMD I would presently advise
against going with two cards unless you
have a very specific game or use case
where you know that these cards will be
leveraged properly so if you're playing
one game where you know the scaling is
good you playing that game a lot and it
seems worth it in terms of value of
spending money on two cards versus more
money on one card then yeah I guess
maybe consider it but otherwise first
sort of a more general use case unless
you're taking into account production
tasks rendering what-have-you those
things we're not looking at here but for
a general use case I would say a single
card is still better than dual cards and
that goes for SLI and it goes for
crossfire so I'm making the statement
statement for both options here for ATS
they have negative scaling in some games
which is clear in Vulcan testing of
course it's incomplete right now but
that is a game and it's something you
can play a Talos principle so negative
scaling there we're seeing negative
scaling in the division we're seeing
good scaling and ashes of course you try
to expect that they brag on that point
and then we see negative scaling and
mirrors
and we see some spurious performance in
terms of the 0.1% low values and other
games and that's normal for multi-gpu
that's where we see the frame latency
czar kind of stretching out between
frame outputs because of the way
crossfire SLI work so overall not
necessarily something I recommend unless
again you have a specific use case and
you want to do it but power is higher of
course then a single card whether that's
a single 1070 or even a single 480 if
you'd prefer to drop your performance
overall
and then thermals are higher noise
levels are higher and performance is
hit-and-miss depending on the game so
that's the crossfire test these were
both 8 gigabyte cards the results would
be different with 4 gigabyte cards we
have a 4 gigabyte where's a gigabyte
single arts for ID test online you can
see that on the channel and that shows
where sometimes that u gigabyte takes
more sense but sometimes it doesn't
matter so as always thanks for watching
