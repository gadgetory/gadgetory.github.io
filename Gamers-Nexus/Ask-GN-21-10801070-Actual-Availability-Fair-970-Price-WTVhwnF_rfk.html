of ask GN as always leave your questions
below for the next episode
this past episode actually the last few
episodes have been getting a pretty good
amount of views and a lot of questions
all of which well most of them have been
pretty good so I'm having trouble
including all the ones I want to include
in each episode as always if it's not
addressed here try posting it again see
if we can get to it so for this week the
first question is from Remus or ramus
king of Rome who says what's a fair
price for a nine seventy one and the
four eighty and four 90s which by the
way isn't officially announced we don't
know if it will exist but when those
cards are released what's a fair price
for the nine seventy so this was kind of
addressed by other counters in that
thread but I can't really say what a
fair price would be I would say the best
course of action at this point if you're
looking at something in that price range
would be to wait I would wait until the
480 comes out see how the rx4 ad
performs and then at that point decide
doesn't make sense to buy a 970 if so
what price should it be if they're if
they're at parity with each other than
the 970 should be the same price or
lower than the 480 depending on what
you're doing but if they're not at
parity then the price should be adjusted
accordingly so there's really no good
answer right now the price was just
dropped for those of you who don't know
the 970 980 and 980 TI are now for the
most part considerably cheaper than they
used to be I think the 980 TI is now at
the $500 range used to be 654 MSRP the
970 I've seen as low as 380 and or
actually that was the 1980 the 980 is as
low as $380 now the 970 I've seen in the
200s so those are the new prices I don't
know what you should pay when the 40
comes out I'll have to re-evaluate that
one it's actually ours next question
Blair rice says how long do you think it
will be till the 1070 and 1080 adding
board partner cards that will be easily
available at the announced prices
instead of $800 plus so this is it this
is a good topic right now if you go on
Amazon or Newegg Newegg all the 1080s
are unavailable they're out of stock on
amaz
if you can find them there are a
thousand dollars which is a really bad
price the hearts spent it's a good card
but it is not a one thousand dollar
video card so don't spend that on those
so that's the price on Amazon right now
Amazon tends to have some opportunistic
pricing either by the retailer's or by
Amazon itself depending on what's going
on in the market we talked to a few
board partners about this we might have
more information for you soon or when
this video goes up it may already be on
the channel but basically look toward
late June to mid July for some
stabilization in the supply and demand
side of the market right now there's a
lot more demand than supply from what
we've been told all the AIB partners are
getting shipments daily but it's still
not enough to keep up so that's sort of
what you're looking at right now in
terms of availability it's going to be
in the next few maybe maybe two to four
weeks in theory if not more but that's
what we've been told officially the next
question is from exiled storm this is a
game inside question exiled storm says
what game are you most looking forward
to from e3
mine is definitely Forza horizon 3 is
what what exiled storm says to mine this
is not a PC game but the one that most
interested me was actually the new Zelda
game breath of the wild and that's just
because it looks cool Ivan let me give
you some perspective on my console
experience the most recent console I own
is a ps2 I guess there's technically a
Wii but it was never really used after
launch month but ps2 is probably the
most recent thing I have so I don't know
that I will actually ever get to play
the new Zelda game but it does look
pretty good it's definitely different
from the what the franchise has done
there are a ton of PC games though a new
battlefield one titanfall two ton of FPS
games in general there's the Elder
Scrolls 6 while not officially announced
was sort of hinted at being in
development by by Bethesda so that's
another one on my radar but it's not
coming out for years to come so that's
what I'd be looking at but the next
question kent's vaughn says does pairing
an AMD cpu with a radeon GPU like the RX
4 80 get extra advantage or any
different
than with Intel so now for Andy there is
no such thing as this better together
approach that we've seen in the past
they will the GPU will perform
independently and the same the only time
that's different is with the dual GPU
solution which isn't really a thing
anymore but kind of worked for a little
while with ap use and I guess still kind
of does with the correct GPU but they
were very low-end cards and not popular
to pair together anyway so no an RX 4 &amp;amp;
8 480 as it stands now should not see an
advantage just because he use AMD the
best cpu for the job will depend how
you're doing if it's a DX 11 or whatever
so no there's no explicit like just
because I'm using this brand the CPU and
GPU it's better that should answer that
question next one is from the LOD Medora
who says thanks for another video if you
have a chance please say a couple words
about external graphics solution
development when do you think this
technology will be supported by the
majority of laptop companies that's
happening now so Hema SCI is already in
gear doing this razor is supporting them
because of course they're making the
razor core Asus is supporting it with
their rog laptops they have their XG
station to power colors making their
double box or whatever it's called
double box I think it's is their
solution that'll make laptops but yeah
that's that's happening this year and
next year it should be pretty reasonably
saturated I would think on the market
but not quite here today though but it
is on the way next question to piggyback
on UEFI versus legacy from last video
does it affect in gaming FPS if I have
Windows 10 solved with legacy or UEFI no
not really
that's that should that's really all
that needs to be said about this
motherboards in general don't really
impact FPS directly as a result of the
board or the chipset some very small
exceptions but the differences would
come from things like overclocking which
are available on one chipset not another
but that's not a direct result of the
board that's a user a user said I want
to overclock this so you need a C Series
or whatever chipset board to do that
UEFI Brasil eggs
you won't see an FPS difference you'll
see differences in your storage capacity
I think the legacy limit is 2 terabytes
or something that uses MBR instead of
GPT but but now not FPS next question
ill - Xbox is back and says as a long
question but basically says where should
I put my PC I have it on top of my desk
is it bad if I put it in the compartment
under my desk there's a bit of space on
the left and right in the top but not a
lot and I only have intake in the front
and exhaust in the back so as long as
you are putting your system in a space
that's not fully enclosed if you don't
have side intake or ventilation then the
sides don't really matter too much the
front don't have a door in front of it
don't have even like he you know boxes
or things like that just keep that
completely 100 percent clear if it's
kind of recessed into the desk and
there's not a lot of space in the back
for the exhaust to come out before it
hits the wall then you might have some
heat issues that's what I would look at
the most is make sure there's a good
amount of distance couple inches between
the wall and where the exhaust is coming
out so that the hot air can ventilate
and get pulled out of there because
it'll get trapped and kind of circulate
and heat things up in your system if it
gets trapped back there but I don't like
putting my systems in compartments like
that if you're doing anything with top
ventilation that's potentially a problem
but for front and back you're probably
fine for the most part there will
probably be a little bit of temperature
difference just by nature of moving it
from one part of the room to another but
but it shouldn't be substantial I would
think that is actually easy to detach
though just install hardware monitor
plus a 264 speed fan or something like
that and you can run it before you move
the system and run it after and see what
the thermal difference is pretty easy
and I'd be interested to see your
results too if you post them below but
last question Greg bourbon says enough
of this techno babble we really want to
know which products do you apply to your
hair to keep it so lush and buoyant not
sure I've seen that word used before in
that context
maybe if we hit 50,000 subscribers I
will release some kind of information
but I think I think I'd like to hear
from
lore'l or Pantene or someone before we
give anyone free advertising so that's
all for this ask Jen comments below send
your emails with questions to loriel
Pantene or other hair product
manufacturers thanks for watching
patriotic postal video I'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
