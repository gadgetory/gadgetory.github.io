nvidia sweet and i am joined by fabrice
from bioware talking about Mass Effect
Andromeda nice to meet you yeah so how
long have you been working on Mass
Effect Andromeda personally five years
since the beginning life and remedy I
was before Levin mass effect 3 worked a
lot with the our team level teams
multiplayer our great last week 3
multiplayer as well and then went on to
DLC and Andromeda so yeah I mean this is
the beginning actually very cool so
having been here since the beginning
probably tell me a bit about the
development process for Andromeda and
one of the things we were just talking
about was on the graphic side so we've
gone HDR display behind us for
implementing HDR as a developer what is
there on your end that you have to do is
there any explicit action you have to do
yeah so first I think the first thing to
mention is that five years ago it was no
HDR it wasn't even a conversation it was
no 4k so when a GTR appeared and the
discussion started I think one other
thing we were afraid of is the need to
redo assets stuff like that so nothing
of that happen and actually just
required upfront to integrating in the
engine so we're using frostbite and
we're lucky because frostbite as
everybody knows it's visually probably
the leading engine on the market for
visual so so it was integrated in
frostbite and once once that is done
that process is done it will actually
there's a legacy that it stays there for
the all the games are using frostbite
and on our side and the only thing we
introduced call grading obviously there
is still some work this so we have the
graphics engineer doing that it's not a
lot of work and it's definitely worth it
when you see the result it's always hard
to show them in video the reason they
see our that's the problem you need to
see them that you saw it so you I think
you can testify how beautiful it is
actually an HDR yes yes it is way more
depth the Prague national solution
nothing is meeting the edge at very
sharp and you in our game they label the
huge and often very open so you can see
actually very far away and the level of
details you get with that de gr and then
the color grading all that is just
amazing so so for us also we're building
a lien worlds and it's very important to
get it feeling
that immersion and you know obviously
we're gaming space so we get a lot of
opportunities to push HDR as far as
weekends very cool on the color gradient
side so is that a manual process or is
there any automation there how much of
the work is done for you by the
technology so a lot of it obviously the
work is done by graphics engineers so
our guys are going to then try to find
systemic ways to an end step so there's
no and then he also got a pass done by
tech heart that's going to double check
the artistic value of it so its a mix of
both but it's mostly systemic which is
really trying to optimize the process
there and I'll bring up answer while
we're here since we're in the nvidia
sweet so Ansel for those who don't know
we've covered it previously maybe at the
Austin event but it's screenshot utility
the interesting thing I was hearing from
you is that you've got use cases in
development for Ansel so what are the
details to that yeah so when we starting
to Grady cancel in the game obviously we
tested didn't see you know everything
working work closely with NVIDIA but
watching was there and working we
actually realize that even generally
it's not only pretty fun to heusen and
you had the 360 view of the screenshot
this is absolutely awesome but it also
helps for example you drink you a
looking for issues in the levels and all
that it captured the 360 levels to
exactly see where where the problem is
and have great read view of it so we
even using now between us just
communicate with that and Ansel is
really that was another thing really
easy to integrate actually in the game
and again we're showing new environments
it's a new game and the you know the
more opportunity people have to share
the experience with Andromeda to bear
for us so so that was really good tool
to write and so for a couple of other
notes on graphics is there anything
special you can tell me about the demo
going on behind us I understand it's in
engine which is important also
absolutely so what are you seeing red
behind us is actually in dng it's not a
video it's it's a camera a timeline
looping so just like a cinematics you
know we're betting cinema it's in real
time 4k HDR it's in a level called
default so it's fairly that at the
beginning of the game in the game you
have stable vault but those places are
very important I leave Leo see they hold
the key
a bit the answer and the key to what's
going on in that new galaxy urine and
again they really huge level you see a
lot of if we get into more details you
see there's a lot of emissive in there's
a lot of the FX going on and this camera
as you can I don't know how much you can
see on video but the performance is
actually pretty pretty so you've seen in
running since it's running since this
morning 9am so you can see that it is
pretty fluid yeah I guess optimizations
fly not even done yet right yeah and
also a lot of it isn't done as you know
now we were losing March train first so
we still have all those ok musician
facets to do very cool so March 21st for
the fall release is there a website or
Twitter account anyone should follow
mass effect on their home aspect calm
thank you for watching subscribe as
always thank you for joining me sir
thank you very much for having me yeah
we'll see you all next time
