with chris Roberts from cloud imperium
games we talk about the upcoming demo
for alpha 3 point 0 that will be shown
at citizen Khan on october nine we also
talked with Chris about some of the
challenges faced in refactoring the
engine talking about lighting tech
visual effects hands-on with the
environments and worlds and things like
that before getting to that content this
is brought to you by antec and their new
MIT X cubed case as designed by razor
which has an aluminum shell is an MIT X
form factor and uses acrylic glass on
both sides now as for the content you'll
want to check back on Friday as well for
our first part of the interview with
Sean Tracy the technical director at
cloud imperium games but let's get to
the content so v2 for procedural
generation where's the the plans unveil
is that citizen khan yeah yeah so we're
going to show so Susan calm we're
actually we're going to show a exactly
it's not a world that will be in V in 30
because it's a we decided because I 30
worlds are very specific as you know
one's a gas giant which you can't go
down onto ones are sort of polluted sort
of Overmind world and another one's
essentially a sort of snow ice planet
like Hoth or something and then our
corpse want just covered with buildings
so we wanted to show one that had a bit
more of a variety like oceans and
forests and deserts and mountains just
you could see the variety of kind of
biomes and so that's what we're we're
calling homestead demo in all the hopes
that's not appropriate for what it's
turned into but it's got some pretty fun
stuff in it Sean sitting over here is a
sort of
you know working pretty hard on it with
a bunch of the pretty town filled so
that's sort of showing up sort of the
potential of the v2 planet and the son
of the cool stuff and potentially some
of the sort of play action that you can
happen in 30 and then we're doing a
taking one of the missions that's in
squadron 42 and we're sort of showing
how that would you know feel like from
getting your briefing to getting to your
ship to taking after flying on the
mission the combination of sort of like
flying and running around FPS stuff so
that's and so those are the two things
were going to show we're basically show
sort of you know full focus this is what
v2 planets can do for you and then this
is what squadron 42 is going to feel
like and play like and this is sort of
the experience of a mission in squadron
pointer sure so squadron 42 is I'm not
going to put any release question yeah
thing that we had active and we voted I
don't know whether data but so it's been
demo'd basically as there's a big news
at City yeah so this is it this is the
first time we will show more complete
gameplay I mean we showed last year at
citizen Khan kind of an example of the
walking around talking character stuff
but it's very early character Tech has
come on like a I mean we're going to
release a 10 for the Chairman Thomas on
the character stuff and if you look at
that and you look at the quality the
characters compared to what was last
year its name day I mean I truly feel
that our character stuff that we're
showing is you know best in class at the
moment so but we're going to sort of
show you know a more complete like this
is actually kind of like here you are
you wake up on the ship you go get your
briefing you do your mission this is
what like one sort of sequence of events
or what we call chapters in the in the
game would feel and look like with the
character tag does anything specifically
you can talk about that that's improved
that you are particularly well you can
ask sure more more questions about that
but I mean there's a lot of things that
have mean the issue when we did the
merit or was that we'd only just managed
to get some of the stuff in there was a
bunch of stuff that was broken in the
shaders whether the skin or the eye
shade or the hair shada the lighting was
completely borked we were missing like
the so in the Senate speech which you
know was the best-looking one at one
where you saw the blend maps and the
wrinkle maps the diffuse map the
tangents Adam were wrong and the actual
skinning of him was incorrect it was the
linear skins that have a quaternion skin
so he looked a bit chipmunky and was
wrong although we thought it looked
pretty good at the time and then the
might and the stuff that was live in the
game wasn't firing like the a bunch of
the things like the wrinkle maps of
blend shapes the and like I said the
lighting and everything was kind of
broken in it so the characters now or
leave some balance because not only if
we just and there were also royal some
raw deliveries of the head first stage
that they didn't have any additional
sort of time spent on making them look
good so we have a process where we scan
the actors but we scan the actors they
don't have any makeup on because you
don't want to have makeup on for the
process of the photogrammetry that you
build a head with and so we didn't
really have any time to to work on those
when we did the merit all this time you
know so we've every actor gets a pass he
gets you know essentially made up like
you would like a makeup artist would you
know make an actor look good for
shooting
you know we've you know we've made a lot
of improvements to essentially how the
whole rig and the engine works and so
the goal is that as you're moving around
and you're talking to people you're you
will be seeing what you've traditionally
seen as cinematic pre-rendered cinematic
quality live in the end really these
characters and that is the goal I think
with citizen Khan we will show something
that's a lot closer to that it will
still get much better than what will
show at citizen Khan as we continue to
work and iterate on it because there's a
lot of stuff that you dial in at the
very end like with the eyes and the hair
and the skin you know so I hair work
still has a lot of stuff to like like we
wouldn't be able to have your hair look
at rest it does right now in the engine
right now but we will we well I mean
that's all sort of shader in terms of
how the translucency and the cards work
and everything so we've we've made some
fixes but we haven't had a lot of chance
the graphics departments been very busy
they want long list of stuff and some of
the list of stuffs been very fundamental
so like you know a massive change we did
which people may not think about is that
you know if you see I think every every
3d engine I know moves the Sun like so
basically the Sun moves right well the
Sun doesn't really move in our solar
system stays in the middle we move
around ray so it was a massive change in
the engine where the Sun is fixed in
place and so it depends on where you are
relative to the Sun is where the
lighting is it's not the sun's moving
you move and that's actually a fairly
fundamental base like rendering and
shading change so that was an example of
something that we had to do because of
what we're doing our star systems and so
night and day cycles on planet for us
will not be because the sun's moving it
will be because our planet is rotating
on its axis and you know we'll also be
able to rotate the planets around the
Sun really something
I've thought about from the perspective
of playing a game where like because
you're not normally traveling around
multiple planets obviously not a fixed
small map so that seems like a pretty
big technical challenge no it's big
that's why that's why we say would like
a lot of the you know a lot of the
fundamental of the rendering and the
trading and how he approaches is
completely being refactored from the way
it used to be in CryEngine because we
moved to you know 64-bit which was a big
deal for the precision you know which we
moved to last year which sort of two was
enabled what we could do 20 and but
there's a lot of other things like I was
saying you know moving the Sun to be
actually an actual fixed entity they you
know Cass it's like correctly as opposed
to being some some confusion is kind of
a special little case in a shader or the
rendering pipeline but they're all being
built so because our approaches we're
doing this at a sort of galactic scale
basically and so we can't some of the
cheats you would use in other cases it's
the same reason for the first and third
person unification some of the cheats
that you would use in games that would
be more of limited like travel or scope
we it's if we could probably short-term
get away from but we create all sorts of
headaches for us so generally we always
go okay how would this work properly how
systemically should this function it's
like was mentioning with the cloud
simulation and the weather simulation
you know we could create a visual
effects house could create a flow map
for clouds and it would look pretty cool
and everything but then you'd have to be
creating flow maps for every single
planet you do and it won't fall out of
it whereas this way if they create the
planet and the biomes control you know
okay this is a higher this is a cold
area and the simulation just simulates
the kind of wind and the weather
patterns which will generate the cloud
pans then you just don't have to do
anything so it takes more work to do
that up front but longer-term it allows
for
a greater sort of range of gameplay and
fidelity and also less work needed down
the road so generally our approach has
been really investing the time and the
upfront stuff because of the long-term
payoff mostly because we know that 30
and beyond I mean we're building you
know we're not building something that
we're going to release and you're going
to play in two weeks right you're going
to hopefully going to play this game for
years and years and years and so we're
thinking okay well what do we do this is
at least a ten year you know our hope
anyway is to be around for ten years
after we released in the same way the
you know Eva's being or World of
Warcraft is being or whatever and to do
that that's one of the reasons why we're
trying to engineer a right which does
mean that it takes us longer to get to
the sort of initial stage where we said
I would have a game ready for you we do
obviously like people play it as we're
building it but I think it's the right
approach to build something for the long
term again as large as star citizen the
just a programming impact alone of a
band-aid fix down the line is when I say
so I will say that in almost every case
you know a lot of like you know we get
our vote you know we get the releases
like 24 or 25 out and in an ordinate
amount of time is spent fixing and
patching systems that essentially
generate bugs because they were just
sort of patched and hacked at a certain
way to work for a certain case so a lot
of you know and in some ways it takes us
longer to QA and get through things than
we would like because there's been sort
of a lot of short-term thinking in
earlier iterations in the air because
you know they're like well we're just
making a game for this it's just a
first-person shooter and and so there's
shortcuts through and then most and it's
not just cry and most engines do this
and so invariably in all these cases we
say well it's just not going to scale to
what we need and we've got to adapt and
change things around for that so we so
we we have been you know because we've
had the support which is great so I
think you have one of those supporting
us is it's allowed us to sort of go in
and do things right so to speak which is
all foundational for a long-running
robust game that will have a lot of
emergent gameplay because that's that
for me super super important me I really
love this idea and I can already see it
and what people do right now and 25 but
seeing you know the community go up and
just do things that we weren't even
thinking about because the system allows
it and so our thinking is always about
how can we create a system for people
rather than specifically kind of control
exactly what they want to do and say let
them operate inside the set of rules in
the system and make it work so for more
information that this wasn't enough
information it citizen can be the place
to look next if you give every one day
it's true yeah well say Susan comments
October night so it's on sunday will be
held here in Los Angeles I think
there'll be more information on our
website I believe we're going to go
start at midday as I right Jared 3pm
midday in Hawaii is we're going to start
3 p.m. in LA and yeah it should be fun I
mean we know we every year we do this
event which is essentially a celebration
of when we first announced the project
and you know the amazing community we
have and the support they've given us
and we not just seeing in this amazing
office we've got three other you know
big I mean this is actually not the
bigger studio the UK should be owes much
bigger than this one it's about 185
people now I think so it's about three
times bigger than this one but where
we've been enabled by this amazing
community that support us to do it and
we're just building the best like the
game that I don't think I would ever be
able to build anywhere else I don't
think any publisher be crazy enough to
invest this kind of time and money into
it you know probably venture capitalist
all the rest wouldn't have the patience
to do it but it's allowing us to build
something long term and and so that is
pretty awesome and so we sort of Susan
consoles celebrating how that started
celebrating the community for helping us
yeah stop and continued on the journal
CT is your quote from one of our first
interview is building the best damn
space yeah ever yeah well yeah I say I
sort of not have a best down space in
anywhere because it's best done
everything so far as we've we especially
with the way the procedural planets of
you know it's moved it moved on we were
unable to do that variable and support
which allowed us to sort of open up the
Frankfurt office and and higher up some
people that are incredibly talented and
then their work went better than we
thought it was going to work and so
that's sort of that's kind of the
iterates iterative way that starters and
worked for we're like okay now this so
now because I wasn't thinking we'll be
able to do what we're going to be able
to do now but I can view the additional
play possibilities that comes with it
and what players can do by themselves is
you know it's really really exciting
because you sort of opened up a much
bigger palette of things that you can do
just because you have planetary
locations you can do things on go
recover things rescue people create your
own little place whatever you want to do
whereas before we're more limited to
space and then landing areas that were
you know just a certain area so it's
from a game from a game designer in
standpoints on making games it's super
super super exciting because it just
means the world is going to feel bigger
and more alive and anyway so citizen
Khan is where we celebrate have one
enable used to do that we tend to show
kind of the you know the next step of
stuff that we're working on and yeah
it's a fun event so links in the
description below for more information
on that will post a link to the robert
space industries website so you can
figure out when that is live stream
stuff like that and as always patreon
link in the personal video if you want
to help side directly subscribe for more
content because we have additional
interviews from this meeting and i'll
see you all next time alright thank you
all guys thank you very much and anyone
that support its doesn't
