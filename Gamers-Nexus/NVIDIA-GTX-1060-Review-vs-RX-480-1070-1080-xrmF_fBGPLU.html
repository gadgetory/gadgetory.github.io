video card including the founders
Edition and the AIB partner models all
today and in theory the price floor
stretches down to $250 though we've seen
how that's worked with Pascal as far and
the founders Edition is priced at $300
the new gtx 1060 uses the GP 106 GPU to
slightly cut down version of the GP 104
200 and 400 chips that we've seen on the
1070 and 1080 and before getting to this
review this coverage is brought to you
by msi and their new x99 a gaming
motherboards for Broadwell ii including
the x99 a titanium board with pretty
serious power phase design when the gtx
1060 initially launched we'd already
published estimated specs that turned
out to be pretty much dead on that
included speculation on TMU county pcs
SMS and g pcs and just as an FYI we're
able to extract all of these numbers by
using simple math so each Pascal GeForce
GPU hosts 128 CUDA cores per SM so by
knowing the total kuduk or count of 1280
cores on the gtx 1060 we can divide by
128 and find out the GP 106 GPU has 10
SMS split into clusters of five between
2g pcs or graphics processing clusters
you can learn more about that on the
website we also know that HSN hosts ATM
use or texture map units yielding a DTM
use on the gtx 1064 more on the
low-level
specs on the drill-down hit the link in
the description below for the article
and you can learn more about that stuff
as far as top level stuff the GTX 1060
founders Edition this is clocked at 1506
megahertz base and it's got a 1708
megahertz boost clock and the MSI card
comes in a bit above that hitting
somewhere in the range of 1809 megahertz
or there abouts when we're running it
with its OC mode enabled the memory is
gddr5 and it runs at 8 gigabits per
second or if you prefer 8 gigahertz
basically the same thing for this type
of measurement and that is g5 not gddr5
X or g5 x
memory bandwidth is at 192 gigabytes per
second calculable by using another
simple equation its memory bus width
divided
by eight to convert bits to byte
multiplied by the memory clock than by
two for DDR and then by two again for
gddr5 the GTX 1060 it has a TDP of 120
watts it uses a single six pin power
header note that AMD non-video TDP
numbers cannot be linearly and directly
compared as they are generated using
different standards and it's more of a
measurement of what's required to cool
the thin than anything we use our own
power draw test later to compare the two
the table on the screen now shows our
bench components check the full article
for complete test methodology drivers
used and more architecture depth we have
more than a thousand words dedicated to
test methodology so I'm not gonna go
through all of it here we're gonna start
with thermals because it reveals some
pretty interesting traits of the
founders Edition cooler especially when
compared against an aftermarket cooler
like the twin froze or six cooler which
by the way is identical on the MSI 1060
1070 at 1080 for the most part there's a
few heatsink differences there's some
missing or slimmed down heatsink some
things like the PWM but basically the
same design so we look at those two with
endurance and short-term testing with
thermals let's start with peak average
thermals and then move on to throttling
analysis the GTX 1060 founders edition
card runs at 40 3.6 C delta T over
ambient it's your channel for an
explanation on what that means and when
under full load that's what it's hitting
but idle it's hitting 6.15 C to compare
the msi gtx 1060 gaming X which we've
also got here with trend froze our six
cooler and noteworthy a higher clock
rate lands at thirty 7.36 Celsius and
that for both of these cards is a good
deal lower than what we saw in the 1070
and 1080 the GTX 1070 fe operated at
fifty 3.86 Celsius load making the GTX
1060 EFI a full 10 C cooler than the
1070 compared between the 1070 gaming X
and 1060 gaming X again pretty
comparable similar cooler from MSI we
see the GTX 1060 gaming X runs 4.4 C
lower with identical ish coolers and the
GT X 1080 EFI runs at 50 7.51 Celsius or
if you add in ambient it's hitting an 82
C a hard stop throttle which we explore
in our 1080 review if you're curious
either way you take it GP 106 is a
considerably cooler chip than what we
saw with GP 104 especially when looking
at the reference design cooler or
Founders Edition or whatever they want
to call these days and that thermal
reduction is a direct result of the
lower performance which demands of
course less power to sort of fuel the
card here's the chart as it appears over
time at listing only a few cards the
full chart is on the site
our thermal testing is fully automated
so a test execution is exactly the same
each time and this is somewhat useful
but if we look at this chart another way
we can add in an endurance metric so now
we're looking at thermals and clock rate
of the reference or founders Edition
card over time you can see that the
clock rate remains stable throughout the
majority of the tests and is able to
sustain temperatures shown here and
there actual non Delta values around 67
to 72 Celsius there are a few sudden
spikes that plunge the clock rate to a
couple hundred megahertz and that
manifests itself as sudden frame drops
in gameplay
these last a fraction of a second and
are noticeable but aren't frequent
enough to get mad about in general the
GTX 1080 had bigger issues when running
this OC endurance test on the FE card
and again we look at that in that review
let's zoom in on this chart though this
version shows the temperature scale
blown up in the time scale blown up so
it just basically turns it into more of
a microscope as to when the clock
plummets and the frequency falls in step
with temperature hitting 71 C which
seems to be the throttle point of the
GTX 1060 and it's auto stock settings
including the auto fan this can be
worked around by increasing fan rpm
which we also measured and is shown on
this chart you can see the fan rpm was
capped at 60% which is probably a noise
consideration that we'll talk about in a
moment but what about MSI is cooler
let's see if the aftermarket cards are
able to compensate for the occasional
frequency drops with a better cooler and
it does sort of anyway first of all the
overall clock rate is higher as a result
of the pre OC applied by Emma size were
at nearly two gigahertz here it's
hitting nineteen hundred something
depending on what game we're running and
notice that the line is almost perfectly
flat that's what you want the GTX 1060
EFI has a spiky line with constant
fluctuation something we've seen on most
reference cards from both vendors and
this has been resolved by more advanced
coolers with the after aftermarket Adhan
board partners this creates a perfectly
stable and repeatable frame rate
throughout the looping Metro test we're
still hitting those big spikes though if
you look around the 100 minute mark and
the burnin it's showing that we
definitely don't have a perfect solution
here with just an aftermarket cooler so
we'll put this card under liquid like we
did for the previous cards and see if it
actually fixes anything or if it's some
sort of lower level voltage or
electrical thing as for our PM MSI
starts at 0% fan speed shown here and
relies on the heatsink for cooling at
lower than 60 Celsius temperature and
that's when the fan clearly kicks in so
we have cross bars on the screen now to
demonstrate what's happening here it's
it's below 40 percent rpm even when
under full load for in-depth thermals
check the article for more as always but
let's get into noise so for a quick look
at noise we've got the chart on the
screen now we measure in idle noise
which is captured at the desktop we
measure the auto fan noise which is
captured after about a five-minute
gaming workload burnin and then after
auto we switch between a 50 percent at a
100 percent fan speed test so you can
see what it looks like in an absolute
worst-case scenario and all of that is
represented here now
GPU fans will basically never hit 100%
unless it's in some sort of really
constricted environment like a mini ITX
case generally and this is true for
these cards as well you're gonna be in
the 50% range for fan speed at its max
and the MSI card was below 40 percent
almost all the time
the founders Edition card was about 50
to 60 percent depending on the workload
so that's what we got for noise levels
as for power we're still working on more
in depth power testing for the future
but for now we're still using a wall
meter and we're doing total system power
draw that means you're basically looking
at deltas between devices because we're
measuring the total system draw not just
for the card so for what we've got here
we measure in a parent power draw which
is represented as both amps or VA and
we're seeing the gtx 1060 efi
run 72 volt amps idle when with the rest
of the build of course and that system
with a 10-6 TFE runs at two 18.6 of old
amps under load this makes it the least
power-hungry card currently on our
rebuild bench though that will change as
we introduce things like the rs4 7460
and potentially a future gtx 1050 the
msi variants is slightly more
power-hungry at 98 volt amps idle and
222 load and overclocking sees the cards
of course boost in their power draw the
msi card is able to run a slightly lower
voltage with its overclock and sustain
the clock rate with greater stability
than the founders edition card and that
does impact the power draw here or a
parent power Joe I should say time to
get into the frame rates we ran nine or
so games through the bench but only have
a few of them here at link in the
description below for all of those games
and as a reminder we convey our metrics
as average FPS 1% and point one percent
lows which helps showcase the poor frame
times that sometimes occur and you can
learn more about that on the channel
where we have a video explaining those
three numbers first shadow of mordor at
1080p ultra there's very tightly timed
1% point 1 percent low values you're
seen on the GTX 1060 are largely a
result of its generally stable clock
rate and the other optimizations and
architects are also helped of course but
the GTX 1060 outputs 87.7 FPS average 60
8.7 FPS 1% low 66.1% lows and the our X
480 as comparison is at 78 FPS average
the percent difference between the 2
1060 Fe and our X 480 reference is 11%
with the 1% lows differentiated by 50.5%
looking at the msi 1060 gaming ex pre
overclocked we're hitting about the same
FPS that's mostly a thermal advantage on
FPS advantage and the difference between
2 1070 and 1062 ARDS is 31% 1440p has
both the MSI and Fe GTX 1060 s at 63 FPS
average landing them well within
playability for Mordor which really
doesn't demand that high of a framerate
the our X 480 runs at 58 fps or a
percent difference of 8 8% between the
rx 480 reference and the EFI 1060 the
1070 runs at
77 FPS average though with repeatedly
lower 1% low values and the 1070 is
separated by a 20% difference from the
GTX 10 60s at 1440p 4k is a serious
struggle for these cards they're really
not quite low end but they're definitely
lower and and they're not really built
for 4k either the 10 60 runs at 35 to 36
fps between the Fe and gaming X cards
there are X 480 sets at 32 fps not a
noticeable difference since the game
becomes choppy at this point anyway but
certainly a measurable one the gtx 1070
r9 390x are more capable cards than
either of these running at 51 FPS
average and 41 FPS average respectively
GTA 5 remains one of our most demanding
gaming benchmarks at 1080p with very
high and ultra settings we're hitting 95
FPS average on the gtx 1060 f:e the 1%
in point 1 percent low is remained
reasonably tightly timed and above 60
FPS even for the dips the RX 40 is
competitive at 85.3 fps
marking a difference of ten point eight
percent between the fe and four eighty
reference cards this is consistent with
mordor in terms of percent difference
scaling and the gtx 1070 fe sits at 123
FPS or a difference of 23.5 percent from
the 1060 comparing the two with percent
difference formula moving on to 4k the
1060 predictably struggles at 33 FPS
average though it still sits above the
SSC version of the 970 we've only run a
few of the most recent cards through GTA
5 at 1440p and just really curious we're
getting 63 FPS average on the 1016 about
the same on there are X 480 our full
Mirror's Edge catalyst analysis is
already on the channel but let's start
with 1080p ultra here we see the FAU
card hitting 82 FPS average while the
msi card hits 86 or a difference of 4.7
percent from that prio see the rx 488
gigabyte card is at 74 FPS or about a
10% difference from the gtx 1060 FG
again consistent with the previous few
titles the gtx 960 SSC prio seed pretty
reasonably sits at 51 FPS or a full
46.6% different from the gtx 1060 Fe
that's a pretty large generational
growth even actually especially
considering the SSC model of the 964
teen 40-feet ultra the GTX 1060 Fe in
gaming action main gaps
similarly to 1080p both just below 60fps
the RX 488 gigabyte struggles with 0.1%
low values tipping the 20 FPS with the 8
gigabyte card while keeping a 47 FPS
average you'd want to drop to high
settings for a more fluid output here as
those lows introduce a lot of stuttering
and jarring motion 1080p hyper runs well
on the 1060 s keeping near 60 FPS
average and the RX 40s it's around 53
fps also pretty reasonable though the 4
gigabyte card struggles with its 18 fps
0.1% lows and 40 FPS average we explain
this phenomenon and the RX 484 gigabyte
vs. 8 gigabyte test 4k had the GTX 1060
s at or below 30 FPS with high settings
depending on the card you can see more
of that chart in the article black ops 3
tends to favor AMD cards a little more
than some of our other games tested and
it's also somewhat clock sensitive it
depending on the instance the settings
things like that at 1080p we're seeing
the GTX 1060 Fe run at 120 2.7 FPS
average and the our X 480 cards at 127
FPS average and 132 FPS average depend
on if it's 4 or 8 gigabytes the MSI GTX
1060 gaming X is at 120 9.3 so we've got
a couple FPS gain actually 7 FPS gain
over the FE card and that marks a
difference in averages of 5% the RX 488
gigabyte and gtx 1060 fer differentiated
by 7.5 percent at 1440p all of these
cards remain well within playable range
even for a competitive FPS the 1060 fe
is at 78 FPS average
gaming acts at 80 2.3 FPS average so you
got a bit of a 5 FPS game there and the
RX 480 is at 83 FPS average so it's
mostly tied for KSC is the FE 10 60 dip
to 38 FPS average and the 4 gigabyte R X
480 suddenly becomes unplayable with its
12 point 7 FPS 0.1% lows the gaming X
sits at 40 point 3 FPS so you ideally
dip the settings for faster competitive
play if desperate to use any of these
cards at 4k but 1440p is a much better
fit ashes of singularity shows Nvidia's
DirectX 11 optimization focus and Andy
meanwhile shows that they've done better
with DirectX 12 and their DirectX 11
performance is pretty bad at 1080p high
the GTX 1060 runs at forty 5.3 FPS
average for dx11 that's the EFI version
about 47 fps for DX 12 the rx 40
performed significantly worse with dx11
at 26 FPS average but is effectively
tied when using DX 12 and the scaling
continues to 4k high though the rx 40
actually pulls marginally ahead of the
GTX 1060 about 0.8 FPS when using DX 12
let's look at frame Layton sees in
milliseconds as the average frame
latency here the GTX 1060 efi runs an
average millisecond at frame time that's
the time between frames of 21.2 nine
milliseconds width DX 12 verses 20 2.07
4dx 11 slight improvement the RX 480 8
gigabytes it's at 22 to average time
between frames and milliseconds for DX
12 versus 39.2 640 X 11 that is a huge
performance almost 2x
1070 is at 15.4 3 at milliseconds
average time between frames with DX 12
and the 390x just for comparison to last
gen is at 20.4 6 milliseconds
we've got more ashes charts on the
website including latency percent change
and several other games are also on the
site including doom assassin's creed
syndicate in some light fashion we've
also got Vulcan and OpenGL tests note
doom the division metro tiles principle
and some other stuff so hit the length
of description below for all of that
overthought can the gtx 1060 is the same
as the previous pascal cards we are
bypassing the voltage frequency curve it
was really a cool idea on paper but I
find it very annoying as someone who has
an idea of what I'm doing and I'm sure
that's true for a lot of folks out there
so we're still using the slider manual
approach to overclocking and as for
results we've got this stepping table
that shows progression of the efi
versions overclock the peak clock just
shows the spikes and can be somewhat
ignored core clock is the column you
want to look at this is the one that we
measure after some burnin and find that
it seems to be about where the clock
sits at once stable we managed
hit a stable core clock of approximately
20 88 megahertz on the FE card with
peaks at 2150 1 point 5 megahertz the
clock stabilized at 2088 during the
endurance burnin since we're showing
here the memory was overclocked by 450
mega Hertz offset so that puts that 44
55 megahertz and that's what the power
target maxed out at 116 percent and the
fan at about 2,000 rpm the overclock is
a 250 megahertz offset from Corp as an
aside notice that in that second step in
our table for overclock progression we
see an increase in the core clock
stability just by increasing power
target and nothing else so that's
something that's worth learning about as
for MSI's card we hit about the same
overclock frequency and struggled to
push much beyond what's shown on the
screen
Emma size card was able to sustain a
tire o'seas with a lower voltage though
which is always beneficial to power draw
and if you want to see overclock thermal
stability charts check the article but
here's a quick look at the frame rate
charts GTA 5 at 4k sees a slight boost
from 33 FPS average to 36.7 FPS average
or a 10 point 6 percent difference as
the efi card and at 1080p it posts the
gtx 1060 at 95 FPS average with the
stock clock and then 104 dot 5 for the
OC variants another difference of about
10 percent 9.5 actually shadow of mordor
at 1080p post the jump of about 9 FPS on
the GTX 1060 EFI with the overclock the
RX 4 80 reference it's at 85 FPS with
its 13 40 megahertz clock rates a gain
of about 7 FPS average 1440p tests
pushed the 1060 efi from 63 FPS to 70
FPS average and more on this in the
article along with Mirror's Edge
catalyst overclocking results and that
leads us to the conclusion so the recent
video card releases from both Andy and
Nvidia have pretty much shown that 1440p
gaming is now a real possibility even at
those higher settings when looking at
the sort of mid-range card market so
previously it was not really possible
for a 200-dollar video card to run 1440p
games with higher graphics settings
and that's shown pretty well in our
charts where we do have the 960 SSC
presence I know it's not all of them but
we have it in some charts and you see a
40 to 50% difference between the 10 60
Fe and the overclocked 960 which was the
SSC version from EVGA this that's all we
got so 40 to 50 percent gains pretty big
or I should say 40 to 50 percent
difference not percent change a percent
difference and that's what allows 1440p
gaming to become more of a reality the
RX 4 80 C's
similarly large gains from the r9 380
and even the 380 X so this is a thin now
that's possible it's it's time really
for a lot of the budget to mid tier
gaming setups to be looking into monitor
upgrades I would imagine if they're
still in 1080p now stand alone let's
ignore the comparison the obvious one to
the RX for ready for a moment and just
talk about the gtx 1060 as a product it
runs reasonably cool with the founders
edition cooler and this is really a big
change from what we saw with the gzx
1080 1080 wasn't awful but we saw some
thermal throttling on it because it was
hitting that 82 C threshold really
easily and that's just a result of a
higher TDP chip I'm not going to say a
high TDP chip but certainly higher than
the 1060 under the very basic blower fan
cooler and we resolved that by putting
it under water and showing how much
liquid actually can improve things or
just better air if you have something
more standard like one of these twin
frozer or a CX or windforce or whatever
one of those Strix all those will
improve over the founder's edition and
reference cards and that's something
we've said since the 1080 intense OD
reviews GP 106 is a big part of this so
GP 106 is a lot cooler it's lower TDP
and lower measurable power draw then the
1070 and 1080 that's a big reason we're
seeing the thermal reduction the
stability isn't bad clock rate stability
is generally acceptable on the FE card
which is the FE card is pretty stable we
see some clock rates spiking where you
get that effect in the chart but it's
not big spikes there's a couple big
spikes and they are pretty large they're
from the
the operating frequency to a couple
hundred megahertz but those are rare and
they're spaced out enough that even
though you can see a very quick and
short stutter in frame output it's not
something that's going to repeat with
great regularity it's not too annoying
and it's not honestly outside of what we
see with pretty much every card on the
market except for the higher-end
liquid-cooled ones like the hybrid and
things like that or the hybrid we built
I should say which is this one here on
the table as for the head-to-head with
AMD the RX 480 is the obvious
competition here it comes in two flavors
four gigabytes and eight gigabytes the
gtx 1060 is strictly six gigabytes it
does not have an eight gigabyte model
does not have a four gigabyte or two
gigabyte model so you're looking at a
card that is priced at $300 for the
founders edition version and 250 as the
bottom and recommended price for AIB
partners that does not mean they will be
available there but they should be
eventually it's normally how the market
works immediate launch they may not be
though so you look at 250 to 300 for a
six gigabyte gtx 1060 that on average in
our test that we've shown in this video
performs about 10% different than the RX
for 80 improvement over the 480 versus a
$200 for gigabyte card that performs
fairly comparable to the 1060 in a lot
of cases but not all Assassin's Creed
syndicate the division are good examples
of games where you really do actually
see a real deficit with that 4 gigabytes
for the 8 gigabyte model for 240 so
let's just look at those two 8 gigabyte
to $40 card verse is a 6 gigabyte which
of course there's more to it than that
because architecture but 6 gigabyte
- $50 - $300 card if you can find a 10
64 $250 it would be a very good
consideration at that price point if
you're already looking at a 480
especially if the 480 uses the reference
cooler because we found that really
quite honestly the reference color was
trash if you can find an aftermarket
cooler ie from an AIB partner for the RX
484
around the 240 to 260 mark versus and
aiv partner gtx 1064 around the 250 260
mark then that's the real comparison to
be making you'll want to look at the
specific review for that product but in
terms of framerate performance general
considerations of overclocking aside the
difference is about 10% in most games
that difference is certainly measurable
in some games
it may be perceptible if you're pushing
just barely past whatever framerate
threshold you're targeting but for the
most part they are both reasonable
performers at 1080p and at 1440p do not
expect 4k from either of these cards so
that's that's most of what I got for you
they are both decent cards the 1060
Effie does cool better but it's $300 so
we really can't consider to directly as
a comparison that's all the data though
so I've given you all the data you need
hopefully you can make a decision from
that I'm not going to make one for you
we try not to do that for anyone if you
have questions post them below do our
best to answer article in the
description below for full in-depth
details including additional games
