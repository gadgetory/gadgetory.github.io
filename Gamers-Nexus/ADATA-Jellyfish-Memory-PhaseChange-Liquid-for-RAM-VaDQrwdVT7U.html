the a date of birth we're checking out
something we missed at CES Ashley
advanced a lot since CES and that's what
was known as the jellyfish memory the
proper name is spectryx dat they also
have a spat ryx d41 kit of memory here
which would be the one in the back so
these are both coming out within the
next few weeks they're actually kind of
new at the show pretty rare for packs
and the dat memory uses a liquid cooling
fluid in the top tube which I'll be
detailing for you momentarily before
that this video is brought to you by the
EVGA z10 mechanical keyboard the EVGA
z10 includes a small display readout top
and center capable of providing Hardware
monitoring information and EVGA
precision statistics the board ships
with either MX brown or MX blue switches
offers a column of programmable macro
keys a volume slider a dimmer and a
detachable wrist rest
learn more at the link in the
description below so for the spectryx
dat this is the one that was called
jellyfish at CES 2018 basically it's
using a normal heat thin or heat heat
fin stack on the outside thermal pad
centrally connecting to the memory
modules as usual that sinks heat up
words and it's hard to see without
taking it apart which hopefully we'll be
able to do we're planning to review
these without taking it apart what I can
tell you is my understanding is there
are a couple of fins in here that are
aluminum fins protruding from the
heatsink on the outside of the memory
module those go into the tube of fluid
which is a 3m Novik fluid so the fluid
in the tube has a boiling point of 50
degrees Celsius as I understand it today
I am pretty limited understanding right
now but once we have a preview I can
talk more about it as I understand it
today basically the 50 degree boiling
point if you were to trip past that
boiling point for the Novik fluid you
would just undergo a normal phase change
like you do for a copper heat pipe so as
many of you know with a copper heat pipe
there's a fluid inside as the fluid
heats up when it goes through the cold
plate you end up going through a phase
change from where it's gas comes back
down by capillary action turns back into
liquid and so forth you lose a lot of
your heat that way through the phase
change process
so for these spectryx at dat kit that's
looking at about 3-4 weeks maybe it's
not final it could get pushed back but
that's kind of what they're looking at
right now for the shipping time for the
speeds probably about three thousand
mega Hertz for starting I think as low
as 2400 and then higher speed hits may
come later
as demand warrants so if you want higher
end let them know but otherwise we'll be
testing this hopefully thermally with a
couple of thermocouples see how it
actually does just out of pure interest
because it'd be fun to do an a/b test
you probably don't need the liquid
cooling on memory these days if you're
really pushing the clocks high sure it
would help but it's ultimately something
that you don't necessarily need but it's
kind of cool so we'll play around with
it the spectryx d41 is also new that's
what's in the back here so this kit kind
of has the same face as the other one it
just doesn't have the fluid in it it's a
standard heat sink not don't really need
a lot of heat sinking on memory anymore
these days anyway they're kind of low
voltage and then LEDs on the top so this
one should be shipping 2400 240 400
megahertz which is actually quite high
capacities 4 to 16 gigabytes and I think
that's more or less it for the show
there's a new couple of them that 2 SSD
as well nbme we'll talk about those
later so main ones for a data here the D
41 and the DAT
and we'll talk about these more in a
couple of weeks once we get review
samples otherwise as always subscribe
