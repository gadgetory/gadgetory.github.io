suite now looking at the big
got-damn so the big format gaming
displays BFG DS are so far there's three
of them there's an Acer and Asus and an
HP this is the HP omen X 65 and is the
the one that's on display now so they're
all the same panel this is a 65 inch
panel 4k display 120 Hertz refresh and
it's got a couple of other features in
there as well before that this coverage
is brought to you by Thermaltake and the
flow liquid cooler the flow is a 360
millimeter radiator with three ring RGB
LED fans you can program the fans our
custom lighting through software and
then of course benefit from the larger
radiator size and cooling performance
learn more at the link in the
description below so game stream and
Android do offer a g-sync support now
and these are panels by au au or AU
Optronics they make the panel for all
three units the Acer the Asus and the HP
omen X 65 the panels have support and
the TVs have support for hdcp 2.2 and
HDMI 2.0 B so those specs are supported
fully there's DisplayPort in on this
panel with Ethernet as well the primary
differentiator between all three
displays is going to be their display
inputs or outputs and other ancillary
connections on the backside the usual
on-screen display will also differ but
other than that the display the panel
itself is the same so all the BFG D
displays right now let's redundant have
the same panel and we don't know if
there will be more yet or when they're
coming but it looks like second half
2018 for the three that are here today
and I don't have price on them it'll be
expensive they're 65 inch displays that
are 4k with HDR 120 Hertz thousand it's
HDR so it's gonna be up there but we
don't have prices today so I can have
2018 is what you should be looking for
for that though
a couple other small features that are
interesting there is dynamic frame rate
I guess adaptation basically so if the
native file is twenty three point nine
seven fps or 24 fps 60 all the way up to
120 I suppose then it will playback
natively in a supported format so we
looked at a demo of the ground
or earlier which is one of the only HDR
shows that I know of right now so we
can't show you unfortunately how good it
looks because we don't have an HDR
camera I don't know that YouTube even
supports HDR playback but it's something
we'll look at more in the future we'll
have to try and figure out how to show
you what it looks like but I think we
have some b-roll demos of SDR and HDR
maybe you'll see something there
otherwise that's the BFG D from Nvidia
there are three of them coming out we'll
have more information linked in the
article in the description below
subscribe for more thank you for
watching I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
