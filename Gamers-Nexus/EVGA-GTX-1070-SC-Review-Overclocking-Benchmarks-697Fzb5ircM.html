making it sadly one of the most
affordable gtx 1070 is presently
available but prices should come down a
bit because the low end is still 380
MSRP we haven't seen that hit market
just yet though because as many of you
have pointed out in comments the 1080
and 1070 are both very limited
availability right now that means that
they're very expensive in the case of
the 1080 800 plus dollars if you can
find it at all still though these cards
from what we've been told by EVGA should
become available on mass probably in the
next month or so
July is their expected time range for
actual availability of these cards in a
greater quantity than they are now the
carbon reviewing today is the gtx 1070
SC it is stock clocked 100 megahertz
faster than the reference design which
is this one and that puts EVGA s card at
1784 megahertz core and it's also using
the AC x 3.0 cooler which is the biggest
change here as is often the case with
AIB partner cards because the reference
design cooler
although Nvidia claims premium materials
and what-have-you is actually pretty
poor at cooling the GPU itself as we've
shown so we're reviewing this thing
today we're gonna be talking about its
value overall fps metrics noise thermals
overclocking things like that as always
link in the description below for the
article which has more charts than we'll
be showing here and will hopefully give
you some additional insight EVGA
superclocked cards are their most
affordable tier of pre overclocked GPU
and this one sits about 100 megahertz
faster than reference the gtx 1070 s he
takes two expansion slots and is a more
normal 4.4 inches height the same as the
expansion slot height generally and
makes it smaller than the gtx ten so d
gaming x from msi that we also tested a
CX 3.0 uses a dual fan design each with
two ball bearings rated for long service
life against a CX 2.0 the a CX 3.0
design uses a marginally thicker fan
blade to reduce turbulence of the blade
thereby reducing vibration and rattle
within the fan
should help control some of the noise
overall and drop the whirring sound that
we've heard in some previous models will
test noise levels in a moment though
like the Twin Frozr and Strix cards EVGA
ACX 3.0 spins down to zero rpm when
under minimal load in terms of
processing or thermals and that means it
produces effectively zero noise until
the fans that spin back up a CX 3.0 also
uses round heat pipes as EB J is done in
the past but adds a conductive filler
between the heat pipe M heat sink this
helps improve the surface area for heat
dissipation and spreading and is
becoming more common as MSI with their
twin frozer six card used square heat
pipes when it connects with the cold
plate so that's becoming a bit of a
trend the heat sink on EVGA SC card is
mounted to a base plate that contacts
the vram and vrm components like MOSFETs
with thermal pads in between the base
plate and those components and is part
of what makes up the a CX 3.0 cooler and
is also what you'll find on the 1080
cards and other cards in the future as
far as visuals a CX 3.0 gets a slight
facelift versus the previous version of
a CX which would be 2.0 and it now has
LED backlights also new the gtx 1070 SC
uses white LED backlights but the FTW
cards will have RGB backlighting
controllable through EVGA software all
right so that's the walkthrough now
we're going to do thermal benchmarking
first just to bring everyone up to speed
we represent these numbers in delta T
over ambient that means we subtract
ambient from the measured value there's
a few good reasons for that I've
discussed them before but very briefly
the ambient temperature of a house
environment even a thermal chamber
fluctuates from second to second and
those can be several degrees in some
cases so we subtract that to normalize
the results and also when you're looking
at the results for your own environment
you'll want to add back in your own
ambient temperature is not going to be
the same as here so that's why we do
that these are delta T which means that
you'll want to for this environment add
in about 20 to 22 Celsius to get kind of
our absolute value but just add in your
own ambient
for a better idea the gtx 1070 reference
card has a maximum temperature of 50
3.86 Celsius under full load measured
with a 1683 megahertz clock
that's about 25 percent different from
the MSI GTX 970 with Twin Frozr 6
cooling Landing at 40 1.77
Celsius when in OC mode at 1797
megahertz EVGA is at gtx 1070 SC with a
CX 3.0 cooler is 13.8 4% different from
the FE card and is at 46 point eight
nine Celsius which puts MSI in the lead
between the two but it's a much larger
card so you have to keep that into
account so here's a look at our noise
data as you can see we test a few
different ways first all the noise print
at the bottom is the footprint of noise
in the room before our test we've got
100% test where the fans are configured
to 100% speed that is both fans in these
cases we've got 50% tests where the fans
both are running at 50% speed we have
idle which in the case of the EVGA 1070
SC and the msi 1070 gaming X means
they're running at 0 rpm so that is the
noise of the system that be the PSU and
the cooler the cv equal in this case and
then we've got the auto test which shows
what you should expect under normal
gaming circumstances without a custom
fan curve right now we're going to move
on to FPS benchmarking we only have a
few games in this video but article in
the description below if you want to see
the full charts for all the games we
tested GTA 5 shows almost identical
performance between the EVGA and msi gtx
1070 cards with the fe card only
marginally behind at 1080p with very
high and ultra settings the EVGA 1070 SC
runs at 120 1.7 FPS average and 87.3 FPS
1% low which is identical to what the
msi card is outputting with it's only 13
megahertz speed difference
the 0.1% lows are the only location
where we see a difference and the msi
card is leading by a bit about 2 FPS or
so at 4k similar results are netted MSI
leading by 1 FPS average EVGA
a leading the 1070 f-e by about 1.5 FPS
so nothing exciting here but somewhat
expected since we're really just
comparing the same architecture GPU
everything with different clock rates
black ops 3 at 1080p it shows the GTX
1070 from msi at 175 FPS average and the
1070 SC from EVGA at 171 FPS average
with the msi card sustaining generally
higher 1% and 0.1% low values it's
stable clock rate as some of this by the
way that doesn't really mean that
there's a noticeable difference at this
obscenely high frame rate but there is a
measurable difference
the founders edition card sits at 166
FPS which is a difference of about 2.9
7% moving to 1440p we see the EVGA gtx
1070 SC and msi 1070 gaming XR
effectively tied with the msi version of
the card leading by 0.7 FPS again
completely unperceptive all to the user
the cards are for all intents and
purposes identical in performance at
this setting with this game and against
the reference 1070 there's a slight gain
of 4.2%
moving to the 1070 SC from EVGA but
that's about all we get at 4k the EVGA
gtx 1070 performs at 55 FPS average and
sustains highly timed 1% and 0.1% lows
at forty three and forty point seven FPS
respectively these are superior to the
fury x which looks fine and its averages
but fails massively in the 0.1% low
department as a result of its limited
vram capacity that creates noticeable
stuttering and msi gtx 1070 gaming x
doesn't have this issue it runs at 57
FPS average and that's a gain of three
point five seven percent over the EVGA
card the reference card is at fifty
three point three FPS average and
they're all pretty close at 4k mostly
because it's such an abuse of setting
anyway shadow of mordor puts the EVGA
gtx 1070 at 121 point 7 FPS or just one
FPS behind the msi 1070 and about one
FPS ahead of the reference 1070 at 1440p
we see a gap marginally widening between
the aftermarket cards and that puts them
at 86 FPS for EVGA and 18
and FPS for msi or a three point four
three percent difference the founders
edition card again at 1440p is at 77 fps
which is actually noticeably slower than
the AIB partner versions in fact it's
actually fourteen point four six percent
slower than MSI and eleven percent
slower than EVGA and this result
coincides with our original 1070 Fe
overclocking results that showed that
Mordor is sensitive to the clock rate
increases Mordor at 4k shows the EVGA
1070 SC at 49 FPS with msi at 51 point 3
FPS and the FV card at forty point seven
FPS are noticeably slower than both it's
actually eighteen point five percent
lead for EVGA over the FE card so that's
a pretty noticeable jump almost twenty
percent and is a reason why you would
want the AIB partner card other than the
thermal is the noise and the price if
you need more reasons in terms of dx12
will just show ashes of singularity here
which serves as one of the new API
benchmark games on our test platform at
1080 high we see similar tearing as
before MSI's 1070 marginally ahead of
the EVGA 1070 SC and that's slightly
ahead of the reference card between the
msi 1070 and the reference 1070 there's
a more noteworthy gap of 8.7 9% the msi
1017 EVGA 1070 are separated by only 3.8
percent between the two of them 4k high
post similar results msi card runs at 49
point 4 FPS average in TX 12 with EVGA
running at 47 point 7 5 FPS average the
reference card finally sits at forty six
point two seven so not a huge difference
there between the three of them
overclocking is one of the few
differentiators of these AIB partner
cards and EVGA s GTX 1070 se is
effectively a reference design so it's
got the same power face setup as this
founded Edition card that is a four plus
one phase power design for the vrm and
it's also got the same power header here
so it's just one eight pin as opposed to
something like this msi 1070 which has
an 8 pin and a 6 pin so considerably
more power there about 75 watts extra
total power budget whether that's tapped
into of course depends on
you other things but that's the
theoretical power budget on that one as
we've said before we use at real world
applications to validate our overclock
so as opposed to using something like
just fur mark where you generate one
very specific type of load and place it
on the GPU and don't necessarily see
failures until getting into games we do
only games or fire strike or something
real world and that means that our
overclocked numbers are numbers that you
should reasonably be able to achieve on
your own device with general allowances
for the silicon lottery so let's get
into the stepping for the gtx 970 SC
with EVGA gtx 1070 SC we were observing
a maximum a core clock rate of eighteen
forty seven megahertz with fluctuations
ranging between these 1786 megahertz
range and that peak point pushing v core
further and of course doing some o scene
gives us room but not a ton of room and
we ended up with a twenty twenty five
megahertz court clock that's with a
fifty megahertz offset from the EVGA
prio sea bass which is different from
the founders edition which has a
obviously plus zero megahertz prio see
we also had a forty six oh eight two
megahertz memory clock on e BGA's SC
device and the power target maxes out at
one hundred and twelve percent on this
card with v core maxing out at one point
zero seven five volts clearly this is an
Nvidia the BIOS limiter for safety let's
switch over to our founders Edition card
charts so you can see how this one steps
up on the FE card and this is from our
Fe review when it first launched we were
able to hit the very same forty six to
eight megahertz memory clock so that
makes sense since they're basically the
same hardware but we had a slightly
lower nineteen eighty seven megahertz
core clock not that much lower though
some of that difference can be chalked
up to the silicon Madhuri and some of it
can be attributed to just superior
cooling on the EVGA card which is
helping us stabilize the clock rate as
you pit it against time and look at the
charts that way msi on the other hand
they go a bit hard so here's the look at
their stepping the msi gtx 1070 we've
got that the gaming ex is pushing twenty
seventy five point five megahertz core
and forty seven ninety-nine
megahertz memory that's an extra 50
megahertz or so on the core that we're
getting with an additional 200 megahertz
memory overclock MSI's using a custom
PCB it's taller and it has a ten plus
one phase power design and an extra six
pin power a header for another 75 watts
of power budget both of these do
contribute to the additional clock rate
gain over the EVGA 1070 SC card despite
using a custom v bios though from what
MSI told us anyway the card is still
stuck at a one point zero seven five
volts v core and that is something we
validated the bit that MSI told us is
that they have a custom V bios and that
it should allow for some extra over
voltage but not really seeing that here
so we are seeing the same 1.0 75 volt
max for each of these devices and the
1070 founders Edition card as for
performance results with overclocking
here's a look at the FPS metrics now
generally we're seeing gaps of a few
percentage points one point eight ish to
three point five percent on average with
only a few clock sensitive tests showing
anything more than that that's pretty
expected for this type of OC though as
the cards are already relatively close
to their limit and you'll only see
actual gains in OC clock sensitive
applications and there are a few games
that do that and in some production
applications
so is this EVGA card worth it well the
1070 SC falls mostly where the 1070
reference card falls in terms of frame
rate metrics your main differences are
outside of fps which makes sense because
there's a lot more to these things than
FPS thermals are critical often under
discussed and that is one of the places
where the SC card does outperform the
1070 EFI handily and to that end with
the EVGA 10 sony SC again we were
hitting forty six point eight nine
Celsius load delta T versus fifty three
point eight six Celsius for the
reference design that's an improvement
and it's at a 100 megahertz additional
clock rate boost over what you get stock
on the FE card MSI does outperform EVGA
particularly with overclocking but
the outperformance is really not that
much in gaming terms now the thermals
MSI does pretty darn well with their
thermals and most of that can be chalked
up to this right here you'll see the
1070 SC is pretty much completely
obfuscated that's because this card is
much bigger it's got bigger fans nearing
100 millimeters and a larger block of
aluminum and copper to help cool the
things so that's where you are seeing
most of that performance difference with
the thermals noise the noise levels of
all these things well of these two
things I should say are pretty similar
as you've seen in our noise charts and
that really brings us down to two things
which is price and availability the
thing is as we've said now the 1080 and
1070 today as of this video are pretty
hard to get a hold of especially at
their actual reasonable prices a lot of
retailers are gouging right now as
they're doing for the rx for any
pre-orders and that's not something you
want to fall into the trap of because
it's not worth it
so the range for these cards is supposed
to be a latest down because it keeps
falling the price range is supposed to
be 380 to 450 we're not seeing that
right now this card is priced at 440 you
can find this particular gaming X from
MSI at forge 60 and then you can find
the gaming non X which has a lower clock
rate for and a more similar vrm phase
design to this card you can find that
one for 440 as well either way $440 this
this card is good this card's also good
but I wouldn't spend 440 today I would
certainly not by the founders Edition
card when you've got these two options
on the table literally in this instance
but they're just it's still a little too
expensive for my tastes
I think as these fall closer to the 400
to 420 mark that would be where I would
be more of a buyer for one of these
cards and that's not to say that extra
$20 is unfair or gouging but it just it
feels a little higher than it should be
strictly because Nvidia did advertise
that price
Flores $380 so I would hand out a little
bit let the stock and the inventory hit
the shelves let it replenish itself as
these retailers are able to get stock
and meet the supply and demand without
crazy fluctuations that they're seeing
right now you will see these prices
stabilize a bit
there'll be rebates things like that
free games whatever and that will all
help with the value proposition but as a
video card the 1070 se is good the a CX
3.0 cooler is substantially improved
over this if you don't want to blow our
fan this is a good option it's got the
LEDs if you like those I don't normally
talk about aesthetics but you can figure
that out on your own overclocking is
okay it's not anything to get excited
about this has better overclocking it
might be more fun you're not going to
see performance difference that's really
noteworthy but you will see extra clock
rate increases that you won't get on
this card by nature of the improved vrm
phasing and more power and things like
that so that should pretty much sum it
up if you're trying to spend less this
is the way to go hopefully it falls from
440 but otherwise I'd hang out for
probably three to six weeks in that
range you'll see more of these Pascal
chips hitting the shelves and after then
the 480 will be launched anyway so
there'll be some pressure to bring these
prices down to what they should be based
on the initial unveil so that's all I
got for you this time overall that's it
no no real strong positive or negative
either way it just depends on what
you're looking for in the price patreon
