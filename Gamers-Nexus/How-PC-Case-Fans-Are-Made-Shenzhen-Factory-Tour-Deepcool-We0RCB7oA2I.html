parts in the pc hardware industry and
are branded by dozens of companies but
only a handful source the parts and make
their own fans in the house
in today's factory tour we'll be looking
at how PC case fans are actually
manufactured and assembled the
manufacturing process will be
demonstrated by the deep cool
semi-automated fan manufacturing plant
at deep cools Shenzhen China location
where the company manufactures its own
liquid cooling and fan products from
scratch it has also begun building out
CNC equipment to build operations for a
cold plate manufacturing and starting
later this year but today we're focusing
on the fans if you didn't know deep cool
also manufactures components for other
brands major ones that you're likely
familiar with serving as a sort of
supplier for air cooling parts for other
aspects of the industry today's focus is
on fan manufacturing with future videos
focused on how liquid cooling and air
cooling parts are made before that this
video is brought to you by the gigabyte
ARS ad 27 QT gaming monitor the ad 27 QT
is a 27-inch 1440p gaming display with
95% of dcpip three color saturation for
high color accuracy accompanied by a one
millisecond response time 10 bit IPS
panel and display HDR visa certification
additional features include fluid
adjustment and slide RGB LEDs for
personal Flair and firmware features
like cooldown counters at reticles and
adaptive and noise reduction learn more
at the link below on the lines today are
both deep cool branded and other brand
fans with the newly built automated fan
assembly line working on the deep cool
units the company also has a manual fan
assembly line but it's transitioning
away from this process and building up
more automation as it moves along the
fan factory starts with strict
guidelines to eliminate dust entering
the facility visitors and workers must
walk through an airlock of sorts which
requires the entrant to walk through a
wind change
so that any dust particles are removed
prior to entry visitors and workers also
must wear anti dust covers on their
shoes to prevent tracking in any
unwanted dust deep pool requires these
processes to ensure dust doesn't enter
these sensitive fan bearings or motors
where specks of dust could create a
whining noise coming from inside of the
fan motor deep pools are old man you
in line assembled products by hand and
is still operating but the process takes
longer than with the new automated
approach the new approach uses a machine
that does the work of eight technicians
and is aided by a handful of operators
to ensure the process goes smoothly the
first step of the process is for for
workers to hand soldered fan cables to
the PCBs where workstations equipped
with exhaust bands ensure the solder
fumes are whisked away from the workers
each station is equipped with a
soldering irons and soldering equipment
along with a tray of the components
being soldered for that day the
completed PCBs are placed into trays
that eventually move on to the assembly
line where operators begin assembling
the PCB and fan frame into a single
units and the frame it gets placed onto
an automated conveyor belt that carries
the frame down the line eventually
encountering a machine which picks up
the frame and places it into a tray to
firmly secure the fan body at the same
time as this happens an operator loads
fan blades onto another conveyor belt
where a series of hydraulic arms
equipped with suction cups move the fan
blades from one belt to another while
the blades are moving down the opposing
conveyor belt the fan blades move
through a series of laser-guided
processes to assemble and secure the
internals of the hub the electromagnet
is already installed at this point so
the first steps include pressing the hub
assembly tighter so that it's more
secure than moving it down the line for
installation of a gasket the gasket
comes from a circular hopper where
gaskets move around these circular
hopper until they're fed to an arm that
fits the gasket onto the hub the next
item in the line is another hopper
this one filled with bearings that go
through another laser guided process of
installation a claw grabs the bearing
and fits it into the fan at which point
the fans are then picked up by suction
cups and moved down to another position
in the metal frames lubricant is soon
applied and then the fan blade is moved
from the opposing sides conveyor belts
and into a carrier from here it's moved
via suction cuff to the fan body and
then dropped into the hub the body is
then moved down the line once more
moving from one carrier into another
there's metal frames that hold the fan
frame and this fan now contains a blade
it's
also moved into the center of the
machine so that another tool can press
pits the blade onto the fan securely and
tighten the two together at this point
the deep cool gam acts four hundred fan
is complete and can be moved down the
line
the fans are dropped onto a conveyor
belt and automatically funneled into a
low noise test chamber where technicians
physically listen to the fan from
multiple different angles up-down and
vertical to check for any more
subjective or undesirable wines or Homs
this testing is done as 100% PWM signal
or maximum speed and after this the fans
are conveyed out of the room within a
room to a testing station that's manned
by another operator the operator
connects the fan to a power source
that's built into the table and the
source spins up the blades to 30% PWM
signal at which point the PWM signal
quality is tested against a specified
requirement for quality control using
scopes and other testing equipment bad
fans if they are encountered are bend
aside for later inspection and may be
reclaiming some of the parts although
these are rare and the rest of them
continue to get boxed in packaging in
another room this completes the PC case
fan manufacturing process at deep pools
Shenzhen Factory the process is similar
at other fan factories it's just that
deep Cole has implemented its automated
line earlier than some motors and PCBs
are made by partners as specified
through the manufacturer they're fed
through the assembly line and then
they're put together either by hand or
by machine in the case of deep cool the
company hopes to add more automated
lines in the future to increase
production capabilities its automated
fan assembly is relatively new and is
still getting regular tweaks so next
time we show this it'll probably be
quite a bit different soon though the
company hopes to see why to roll out
across other product lines and across
partner lines for products that deep
cool makes for some of its industry
