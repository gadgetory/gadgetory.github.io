dotnet and this is your weekly hardware
news recap first up for the week nvidia
posted their fourth quarter fiscal year
2016 that results earnings revenue all
of that and they had record-breaking
quarters and actually record-breaking
year earning one point four billion
dollars per quarter this is up twelve
percent compared to the previous year's
fourth quarter and that income was at
207 million for a quarter for 2016 now
again this is their fiscal year
obviously not the actual year and that
is up 7% from quarter four of their last
fiscal year and videos a GAAP adjusted
revenue for the fiscal year of 2016 was
a staggering 5.01 billion dollars up
seven percent from last year
and net income was six hundred and
fourteen million which is down 3% but
non-gaap net income was 929 million
which is up 16% from the fiscal 2015
year so it just kind of depends on what
you're looking at you can see a chart on
the screen with some more information on
that now another big news item for the
week was Vulcan so Vulcan is new API and
that is being developed by the Chronos
group who are working with Nvidia and
the basically anyone relevant Intel of
course and they're developing this API
to basically compete or at least
complement DirectX 12 on non Windows 10
devices including Windows 7 8.1 and 10
of course and then Linux operating
systems are getting Vulcan as well so we
benchmarked Vulcan if you're subscribing
to the channel already you've seen our
benchmarks and we found that presently
with the one game that supports it which
is Talos principle the API actually
performs worse than DirectX 11 so that's
that's not that surprising to be honest
because it's brand new the game Talos
principle has not fully optimized for
Vulcan it wasn't built from the ground
up for Vulcan which certainly is is an
inhibitor to performance enhancements
with the new API especially that since
the game was built on DX 11 and 9 even
is supported in in the Talos principle
but going forward volc√°n should be a
pretty interesting API to follow because
does allow developers to get closer to
the hardware and that would allow for
better overall performance it removes
from the bottleneck in from a cpu and
should be a good complement to DirectX
12 for especially platforms that are not
Windows 10 Intel this week also
confirmed that it's 10 nanometer chips
will be coming to market by the second
half of 2017 and in that same
confirmation they said that they will
not delay past 2017 so that definitely
puts a bit of a muffle to some of the
concerns that 10 nanometer would be
further delayed certainly a trend that's
occurred in fabrication and chip making
in the past but Intel is hard set on a
delivery of ten nanometer chips by
second half of 2017 and for those who
don't necessarily know what that means
generally these shrinks and the die the
fab improved things like power
efficiency theoretically improve overall
power output in terms of performance
because you can pack more on their
transistors are smaller so you can fit
more on their the die package can remain
the same or shrink depending on what
sort of the objective is for that
particular architecture so it's a big
deal to move down to 10 nanometers and
as Intel continues advance you know as
AMD continued advancing that video of
course as well they are actually going
to start encountering issues because the
shrinks are now getting to a size
especially on the eight nanometer point
which is coming up soon where new fab
technology will be required even to
start dealing with these chips with the
silicon at that sort of ultra
microscopic level so very interesting to
follow going forward but in the meantime
we can expect 10 nanometer chips for the
immediate future and that will hopefully
become into the normal socketed
processors as well this next news item
was a bit of a shocker when I read it
gigabyte is shipping motherboards for
the 990 FX series and other
am3+ processors and this is surprising
because it's definitely a dated
architecture at this point is n is sort
of right around the corner the AP use
are really the only modern product that
Handy's shipping but gigabyte has
decided to push one last effort of
motherboards through the channel
as Zen is sort of sitting in the pipes
ready to go or at least preparing to get
ready to go so the new motherboards they
have 990 FX and a 970 board is 990 FX
gaming a 970 gaming sort of sticking
with everyone else's branding out there
and all these really do of note is a Dem
dot two slots to the board and they also
add USB 3.1 neither of which is natively
supported on the now aged am the
platform and that's alongside things
like pcie 3.0 USB 3.0 actually is not
natively supported either it's a lot of
stuff that's not natively supported on
these boards that are on architectures
or chipsets from 2011 and even earlier
in some instances so that is the last
push probably for the FX series of
gaming processors right now in terms of
motherboard support the last news item
for the week pertains to free sync which
we've seen come up a few times recently
in these news recaps including last
week's where we talks about HP's laptops
getting an AMD freesync in the immediate
news item a just happened Andy has now
shipped a Linux driver that will bring a
free sync support to Linux operating
systems and these senior software
engineer Harry wetland stated that free
sync support will be coming to Andy's
Linux drivers through the AMD GPU DAL
driver and in this note we saw that
other changes included support for six
displays in any configuration including
HDMI DVI DP DP MST etc solid support of
4k at 60 timings on ap use power
features such as clock accurate
bandwidth formulas and improved
interaction with power play to maximize
power savings and improved audio and
other info frame related features that
was all on the list from this new AMD
APU and free sync driver push especially
as it pertains to Linux so that is all
for the last week in the hardware news
be sure to subscribe to the channel for
more information we've got some cool
videos coming up reviews cases all that
normal stuff and actually a motherboard
issue where there may have been a slight
fire so Duke check back for that as
always if you like this coverage
