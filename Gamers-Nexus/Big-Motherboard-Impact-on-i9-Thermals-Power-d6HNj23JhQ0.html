when we reviewed the gigabyte gaming 7
motherboard for the 7700 K we found that
its auto voltage curve ramp to the CPU
and to unreasonably high temperatures
for no performance gain when compared to
competing options even manual options
gigabyte later fixed that auto voltage
and we now use the gaming 7 for GPU
testing regularly and like the board a
lot but we're exploring a similar
scenario with the i9 7 960 X which also
applies to certain 980 XE and 7900 X
we'll be demonstrating how motherboard
and BIOS revisions can heavily impact
the interlinked thermal power and
voltage values when using Auto settings
before getting to that this video is
brought to you by synergy the software
that lets you share a keyboard and mouse
between multiple systems if you have
limited desk space and multiple
computers to command synergy removes the
need for separate peripherals or a KVM
and works as over the network software
use our link below to get 50% off the
home or provision with SSL the point of
this testing is to show well it's really
to revisit a few things so we did all
that deleting testing with the i9 CPUs
and the testing there was it was either
overclocked and over volted or it was
3.6 gigahertz so not really overclocked
if at all depending on CPU and a fixed
1.15 voltage ID the 1.15 VI D as noted
in those content pieces was higher than
necessary but it was chosen because it
would stay fixed at that voltage without
moving at all and that's what you want
when you're doing comparatives between
two thermal interfaces you really don't
want otto taking control of things
because who knows what it's gonna do who
knows if it's gonna respond differently
under different thermal scenarios or if
it just decides to do something
different one time versus the other
which happens basically every time you
run a test without a voltages with the
exception of the gigabyte board we'll be
looking at in a moment but the point
though is to revisit some of that with
Auto settings not for purposes of
showing thermals necessarily as the the
main item we're looking at but more for
purposes of showing how a motherboard
and its auto settings with the voltage
look-up tables can pretty significantly
impact your performance in a lot of ways
it can impact power consumption
directly it can and will impact thermals
directly as your power output in watts
goes up so two goes up the thermal
output or the measured thermals of the
CPU because you have to dissipate more
heat and it affects a lot of things so
hopefully this educates a bit on doing
some manual tuning yourself whenever you
buy any processor because Auto voltages
are often a bit excessive but it's to
make sure they can support the speeds
and the advertised specs across all CPUs
and motherboards because there's some
variants of course CPU to CPU so the
boards were looking at we have five
today well we have three boards with
five configurations across them so the
Asus Rampage six extreme was our primary
board for the review the liquid metal
burst Tim testing and everything else
we've done so far with the 79 80 and 79
60 CPUs and then we also on that we have
the zero eight zero two BIOS revision
which is the latest EFI from Asus and
this board was joined by the ACS prime X
299 deluxe motherboard a lower-end board
and that uses both the pre 79 ATX
e launch efi version and the newest 0 8
0 2 revision the gigabyte board the
gaming nine joins this one and for that
we're using the latest efi revision f6
and the launch
7900 x efi that was sent to press i
don't have the specific number on that
it was a press launch but the point of
doing these is the 70 100x launch efi
for the acs prime board and for the
gigabyte gaming 9 board basically came
out before the 79 ATX he really existed
the public or was finalized and that
means there's no profile tuning for that
cpu the 18 core or the 16 core CPUs it
was built for the tank or so we should
see different results because the BIOS
should respond differently based on if
it has that voltage lookup table for
that specific CPU we're just gonna be
focusing on blender for most of these
tests we did use prime 95 for everything
as well it's a great test but prime does
a lot of stuff that is
kind of difficult to control for once
you start getting into this kind of
testing so it does power cycling which
means that in some head-to-head tests
you end up with occasionally way more
amperage going through on one test past
and the other based on a couple of
different behaviors of the software so
we did run prime but we ended up just
going with blender for everything
because blender once it ramps up and
starts going nine times out of ten it's
a perfectly fixed pretty much constant
current going down the EPS 12 volt
cables the load doesn't really change as
long as the project file stays the same
the other one out of ten times we will
see really spiked loads or higher
thermals but you just develop an eye for
that and then eliminate those results as
outliers as necessary for this type of
testing so we're using the Intel I 979
60 X for these tests and we're using the
liquid metal modern version can't really
go back on the head for the most part so
we're stuck with it and we're using it
for these tests and we're gonna start
with a voltage id behavior on auto
settings between the three motherboards
with the five different EFI versions
voltage ID behavior directly influences
everything else so using all auto
settings with XMP one and max fan
settings those are the only changes we
made the first gaming nine tests with
pre-launch BIOS pegs VI D at roughly one
point zero one volt and that's again VI
D for the entire test this never really
changes it's a perfectly flat line for
the most part the Asus Rampage
motherboard fluctuates and bounced
around between 0.91 VI d and 1.0 VI D
generally sticking to zero point nine
six to zero point nine seven for the
entirety of the test if we're looking at
the more frequent numbers we only
started using this board with the seven
960 X launch and it had the latest zero
eight zero two BIOS already so the board
has a tune for the CPU and seems to
behave as you'd expect the ACS Prime
board with the original efi also bounced
around a lot at least a lot more than
the version with the efi version zero
eight zero 2 and we averaged 0.89 to
0.96 a PID with the pre-launch version
and 0.96 to 1.0 with the zero eight zero
two
the most noticeable jump is the gigabyte
gaming nine EFI update to version f6
from the 1700 ex reviewer EFI version
we've moved from one point zero one to
VI D to a range of one point zero six
five to one point zero eight voltage ID
depend on which core is measured this
has a more significant impact on both
power and thermals than any of the
previous tests for power testing we're
measuring at the EPS 12-volt rails which
means that the bulk of our power
consumption is the CPU some other board
components will also pull down this
power cable but nothing close to the
CPUs consumption that said there is some
error involved in changing motherboards
for power tests even when measuring a
TBS 12 volt cables but not really that
much comparatively the rampage 6 extreme
on auto and 796 TX are measuring about
217 watts at the EBS 12 volt cables
again this is under auto conditions and
with a blender workload so it's not the
most power we could pull but also not
the least the power consumption will
change based on the application used and
as we're showing here the motherboard
issues Prime board with the first EFI
revision which ran over all lower
voltages of 0.89 to 0.96 versus the
average 0.91 to 0.98 of the ram-paige
managed to consume about 206 watts on
average updating efi to version zero
8:02 moved our VI d to 0.96 to 1.0 as
the range which consequently shifted
power consumption to 222 watt that's
just from an EFI change on the same
board the gigabyte gaming 9 with its
original efi had a higher sustained
voltage idea 1.01 - constantly which
produced a higher power consumption and
the gaming nine with its efi at version
updated measured at 230 watts so that's
now 30 watts more than the lowest board
and lowest efi and about 15 watts higher
than the previous three configuration
average we ran two tests of the gaming
nine with version f6 since the results
were so much higher in power consumption
than the others and we wanted to double
check them the tests had some variance
but we're overall much higher in power
assumption anyway we were between 255
and 268 watts depending on which test
and that's now 50 to 60 watts higher
than the lowest board on the stack which
shows just how much auto voltage tables
can impact results as precisely why we
fix voltages for things like comparative
testing between Tim and liquid metal but
obviously you'd still want to test Auto
for the motherboard reviews or just to
figure out what the CBO and board will
do in a user scenario without tuning
thermally voltage of course impacts
results directly we have a tolerance of
plus or minus 3 degrees Celsius for
ambient and the thermal application
differences here but can still see gaps
in performance the ram-paige 6 cooled
the best some of this is because of the
spacing of the V RMS from the socket and
landed around 40 to 44 degrees Celsius
gaming 9 with launched EFI plotted at 42
to 46 degrees Celsius again all Auto
settings with the ACS Prime testing at
around forty six point five degrees
Celsius for zero eight zero to the
gigabyte gaming nine with the f6 EFI
plotted at around 52 51 degrees C for a
10 degree gap versus the lowest
temperature on the blot so that's pretty
big deal that's what happens when your
voltage lookup table when it's set to
auto and the motherboard vendor is a
little aggressive on the voltage table
that's what you get higher wattage
consumed higher thermals as a result and
the performance is the same as long as
all the cores can sustain their
frequency it doesn't matter if you push
more volts through it it's just burning
power for the sake of burning power so
there's an argument here that by taking
a conservatively high voltage value VI D
or V core whatever demand what you're
working with a conservatively high value
means that probably you're gonna support
every die that comes off the line
whether it's low quality or high quality
sure but also there's kind of a limit
here to what's reasonable so gigabyte
once again is pulling a little bit more
than they need to it's not nearly as bad
as the gaming 7 Z to 70 motherboard a
little bit higher but not terrible still
though there's 10 degree difference
there so if you get that gaming 9 board
or already
it we would recommend manually dropping
the Vig setting until it stops being
stable until you're either clock
dropping or crashing and then increase
it a little bit it should still be lower
than Auto and you'll have lower thermals
for it and lower power comes on it for
it and both of those things are good
especially for the life of your liquid
cooler if you have one but the point
isn't really to look at the motherboard
specifically although would it I mean
there's a note for gigabyte if you're
watching this video just again look at
the same thing as you looked at for Z
270 but that's not the point the point
is motherboard changes matter a lot they
always have but we just figured we'd
show it on a CP that's particularly
power-hungry because it exaggerated s--
the results a little bit and also kind
of as a reminder of hey this is why when
you're testing something like a CPU
cooler a thermal interface or anything
in between like a shim any kind of
cooling dissipation test that does not
involve a review of the CPU specifically
should be done with a with the same
motherboard every time with a fixed
voltage a fixed frequency all manually
set ideally a little bit conservatively
high on the voltage like gigabytes doing
here just to make sure nothing changes
so that's why we do that for those tests
but yeah depend on board you probably
want to manually tune that voltage down
to see where it's the it's still stable
with the least amount of voltage go into
the CPU if you're using it in the stock
settings without any overclocking
another note here so I want this quickly
show some of our auto tests temperatures
for the 79 60 X a little bit for this
around 80 XE we we never did get to run
all the liquid metal tests because I
mean I ran them and then left to go to
do Linus's thing but we've got those set
to auto and before showing the charts
didn't show these in the original review
because again they were set to auto so
the voltage changes a bit from tested
test which means that it's not a fair or
valid comparison if you're trying to
test liquid metal advocacy
versus Tim because the voltage
properties are changing so you're not
testing the interface material anymore
you're just kind of testing the
temperature at whatever voltage it
decides to run out for that particular
test pass and it will change pass to
pass regardless of the interface
material but we can show those charts so
this is what the auto temperatures look
like will show Prime we can show blender
as well at some point basically it's a
lot lower than with the fixed voltages
and frequencies of course as you would
expect but this demonstrates even still
even with the variable voltage setting
that's Auto and kind of bouncing around
we're still seeing improvements with
liquid metal if you overclock you should
definitely put liquid metal on there
because that's shown in the original
content piece I once we were
overclocking the 4.6 4.7 gigahertz with
1.2 2 to 1.2 for voltage ID 7 900 X I
think was at one point one seven five is
pretty pretty good chip even with those
settings that were especially with those
settings that's when you should start
caring about either deleting and
replaced with a better Tim more on that
soon or deleting and replacing with
liquid metal because dropping even 10
degrees which was about the lowest we
dropped at that point with the
overclocks even dropping to 10 degrees
is a huge difference between your CPU
being in the 90s 4 degrees Celsius on an
open-air bench where ambient is 24 and
being in the 80s and you might ask who
cares if it's in the 90s or 80s well who
cares is your liquid cooler and the
manufacturer because they're not going
to want to fulfill your RMA when it dies
because the liquid was running at 60
degrees Celsius which is above or at
spec that's who cares so it helps to
bring down the temperatures it's
unfortunate that you have to do it
yourself if you're overclocking but if
you're not overclocking you're fine you
don't need to deal with the thing if you
are and you're using a CLC that's either
well so a few things here one either
using a huge CLC like a 360 or a 420
because you need to deal with all that
heat
and you're like what temperatures are
probably bit better and your fan noise
is higher because you're gonna need it
or using a smaller CLC and you're
pushing the limit of what the pump
realistically should be handling even if
your CPU looks like it's okay so in both
those scenarios you can improve things
by D letting changing the interface and
either you lower your noise levels and
improve your cooling which is probable
or you can step down your cooling
solution to something cheaper maybe a
240 maybe a 280 with slower fans and
still be better off than 10 but this
isn't new as we showed this in the
review and then the part one of the
thermal thing but I mean the point again
is motherboards impact things a lot do
some manual tuning on it if even if
you're not overclocking if you're not
overclocking at all thermally you're
gonna be in better shape than what we
show when overclocking or went over
bolting but even still even with that
variable voltage we were plotting
improvements with liquid metal it just
doesn't look as big because the voltage
is bouncing around so who knows what
it's doing
but that's all for this one as always
you can check the article in the
