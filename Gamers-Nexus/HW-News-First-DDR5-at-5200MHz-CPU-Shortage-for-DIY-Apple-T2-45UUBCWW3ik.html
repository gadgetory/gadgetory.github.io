recap for the last week for this one
we're talking sadly
primarily about CPU shortages and it's
sad because typically end of the year we
start seeing things like oversupply and
trying to get rid of it thereby driving
down the prices but that is not
necessarily the case this year for at
least fourth quarter of 2018 also
talking about SK Hynix
and ddr5 memory some of the first to
market potentially and apples t to chip
and its attempt to completely port your
ability to repair products not too much
of a surprise keyboard mouse support on
consoles and rx5 90s before that this
video is brought to you by iy power and
the rush delivery to you program the
fresh RT y approach gets high-end gaming
pcs shipped the same day you order them
and it's also one of the only places you
can get a 9900 k for a reasonable price
right now systems include the rdy
enthusiast level gaming pc with a 20 80
TI 900k and 16 gigabytes of 32 hundred
megahertz memory available with same-day
shipping or pick up locally these
systems are built by people who are
experienced builders and component
choice that makes sense
learn more at the link in the
description below quick update for those
of you who missed our live stream we
just restocked the two-tone Raglan
hoodie so if you wanted a lightweight
hoodie from us those are now back in
stock in all sizes so asus is CEO on
Intel CPU shortage just as an
interesting one for a couple of weeks
actually couple of months now we've been
talking about 14 nanometer shortages as
intel has faced difficulties ramping as
a 10 nanometer production and this means
that they've done things as far as for
example reviving some old 22 nanometer
facilities and converting some chipset
designs over to 22 nanometer even for
modern chipsets and these are primarily
for B series chipsets in that instance
or H series so the CPA shortage is is
absolutely a very real difficulty for
Intel right now they've even started
outsourcing some of their cpu production
to TSM C as we reported a couple of
weeks ago but Asus is CEO Jerry Shen has
stated that the company has now itself
seen Intel CPU shortages affecting them
firsthand so sheddin points to the DIY
and client sector in particular and
notes that he expects sales to remain a
flat
or ASIS for the end of the year largely
resultant of the CPU shortage that
should extend through a second quarter
of 2019 according to Jerry chené chené
also mentioned the growing competition
in the notebook sector now as well as
the us-china trade war having an adverse
effect on a CSIS operational visibility
which according to Shen is down 20% for
the fourth quarter of 2018 this is a
steep decline from an excess of 50% in
previous years for the same quarter
China also said that Asus expects PC
shipments remained flat throughout the
rest of the fourth quarter and that's
despite normal holiday demand which is
obviously quite high typically on the
same note Intel is reportedly backing
off CPU DIY sales for the end of the
year for fourth quarter 2018 and that is
instead to focus on system integrator om
partners notebooks and server partners
where margins are a bit higher and
demand to study so digitize reports that
Intel may reduce DIY retail availability
of CPUs by about 2 million units
bringing them down to about 6 million
units total for the end for fourth
quarter 2018 and is instead of shifting
those units to other segments again
notebook servers sis OMS not DIY
techpowerup additionally reported on
this story noting that Intel is boosting
its capex to increase its production
capabilities in some regions like
Malaysia for example and that would
expand its fabrication plans although
that change is obviously not immediate
and Intel's capex boost would focus on
expanding notebook and pre-built markets
primarily SK Hynix announced this week
that they've completed the industry's
first ddr5 JEDEC compliant DRAM chip and
these new chips will offer a capacity of
16 Giga bits that's that's bits just to
be really clear there and a 5200 mega
transfer per second per pin speed the
DRAM also operated at one point one
volts reduced from a typical ddr4
voltages of about 1.2 volts and is
fabricated on SK Hynix is 10 nanometer
process note hynek's expects its future
ddr5 chip slated for later production
for 2020 volume production to support
higher capacities and transfer rates up
to 6400 mega transfers per second per
and in addition to the memory chip
hynek's is working on its first ddr5 our
dim or rdimm the new DIMM modules will
offer bandwidth of 41.6 in gigabytes per
second which is noteworthy because ddr4
with extreme overclocking and better
cooling peaks at around that level so
there's your comparison the design of
the new dims will use 288 pins across a
curved connector and that's to both
reduce insertion force and avoid
accidental installation into ddr4 slots
which would be suboptimal especially
given the fact that it shouldn't fit
there so that's that's primarily a human
factor is changed make sure that it has
a different form factor and isn't used
in the places it shouldn't be apples t2
chip this is this is a good one
so the t2 is a coprocessor focus on
security but it's not just to any kind
of security it's a special kind of
security the kind designed to secure
apples margins and revenue because every
time your water sensors get tripped from
high humidity Apple wants to make sure
you can't just replace things and keep
the laptop functional so this is it's an
interesting one the the t2 is primary
functions are things like processing
touch ID data or storing cryptographic
keys for secure boot things like
handling to Siri requests protecting the
microphone from remote access legitimate
things but it also combines several
discreet controllers like the SSD and
audio controllers and further the t2
chip acts as a tool to limit third-party
repairs according to internal Apple
documents so they're legitimate the t2
equipped Mac's will require specialized
software known as AST 2 and that's Apple
service toolkit - it's only distributed
to Apple stores and authorized a STS and
that's already a really strict program
and if certain parts are in place the TT
chip detects a repair attempt and then
tries to validate that repair so without
the ast2 software the verification
process can't be completed that's the
trick here and the software requires
also an internet connection making it
more difficult to trick the T to chip
can't validate a repair and
without ast2 and if it does not then
validate the repair it will render the
device useless making it inoperable by
refusing to allow booting of the device
however Adam ochem from I fix it was
able to replace the logic board as they
call it the display and update Mac OS to
Mojave without using the ast 2 software
and a blog post that I fix it Oh cam
speculates on why this is so why is
Apple doing this he writes it could
simply be a mechanism for tracking parts
used by their authorized network to
check quality or replacement rates it's
possible that units with swapped parts
may operate normally but still report a
failure in Apple diagnostic tests for
having quote unauthorized components
installed much like earlier units did
for earlier versions of AST for
third-party hard drives SSDs or RAM and
batteries if it's not then we have a
problem making part swaps dependent on
secret software would be a customer
hostile move it would impact people that
don't live near and a ASP can't afford
to go to one don't have time to mail
their device or like to use their
computer longer than five years the
timeframe that Apple supports their
hardware except where legally required
otherwise third-party repair shops which
cater to the aforementioned groups
already struggled to keep up with
apple's shenanigans Oakham concludes and
as Oakham mentions in the blog post DIY
repair seems to be intact for now but
the teeth you chip is something that we
need to all keep an eye on so it's it's
threatening at best to your ability to
repair parts and this is a it's it's a
slow stripping away of consumers
abilities to maintain their devices this
is not something that happens overnight
Apple has been working on building its
its ability to replace devices only
internally or while high mean if you
watch any of Lewis Crossman's videos
you'll see that most attempted service
repairs do end up and just buying a new
computer and Apple wants to keep that
going clearly so it's a very slow
stripping away of those rights of the
consumer to maintain the device and keep
it going I mean clearly we've got a
table full of tools actually several
from iFixit and taking apart components
so clearly we're fans of the
to open things work on them fix them and
keep them going and and this is a bit
concerning because what Apple does if
you don't like Apple doesn't really
matter what Apple does extends to the
rest of the technology industry look at
what NVIDIA has been doing lately with
some of its designs so Apple could
further lock down Mac's new devices with
software updates that would render
incomplete in quotes repairs null and
void and make the devices inoperable it
would force users to go to an Apple
store and at that point if they see if
it's been modified by someone who is
into them who knows what happens so
Apple has a long history of not
supporting third-party repairs and an
aggressive stance against the right to
repair in general and if you do like
this topic we strongly encourage
watching some of Lois Rossum's videos on
it he is he's personally affected on
this one so this one's pretty quick
because we already covered it and Vidya
has addressed some issues with defective
r-tx twenty series cards this is it it
leaves a lot to be desired so we already
did our content piece on the over ten
cards that we received from viewers that
were defective or somehow not working
bsod is for example we did the piece on
that we talked through all the the
primary points that we think the problem
is not like thermals for example and
then speculate on a few things that we
have some level of confidence that it
could be like in silicon issues of the
memory or GPU or component level
manufacturing issues in terms of
mounting the devices to the PCBs and one
thing we didn't do I don't think was
show the forum post by Nvidia in that
content and Nvidia's forum post said
that quote limited test escapes I think
they're there to break it out it's ties
make a break for it a limited test
escapes from early boards it caused the
issues some customers have experienced
with our DX twenty atti founders edition
cards specifically naming efi there
although some board partners did have
their own artifacting issues they didn't
often seem to be the exact same thing so
I mean in the very least its
acknowledgement of the issue if you had
the issue it's real and video knows it's
real and they'll replace the part for
you we have heard from some people that
they've had to wait several weeks
- a month for replacement because of I
suppose supply to some extent and also
just the RMA process in general but you
can visit an video.com slash support to
get support from Nvidia steam and they
say quote we stand ready to help any
customers who are experiencing problems
and then of course you can check our
video on this subject if you wanna learn
more about all the various things we've
done with the defective twenty ATT eyes
in the last couple weeks keyboard and
mouse support for the Xbox one up next
so with the most recent November update
Microsoft's Xbox one consoles will now
officially offer keyboard mass support
you could have done this already kind of
but now it's official and with a handful
games already supporting the peripherals
while most modern USB keyboards and mice
will work
Microsoft is currently working with a
razor to bring specific hardware to
market and points to CES in January for
more news on the subject as an aside
Coursera has announced that they are
attempting to be among the first in
licensed hardware partners with
Microsoft as such Coursera announced
compatibility for their keyboards and
mice with the Xbox one consoles of
course they're also site's future
projects with Microsoft such as
integration of Microsoft's mixer and
Corsairs recently acquired al gato so
that could be pretty interesting news
for future generations potentially rx
590 is next so this one we're still
working on ours it's a this week was
busy with all the other stuff going on
CPUs and GPUs primarily so we're still
working on ours we'll have a review up
for you soon if it's not already up but
probably another day or so from the time
of this video going up and after weeks
of rumors and conjecture just to kind of
close this one out power color and XFX
get to claim first just like the youtube
comment or what their rx 590 cards the
rx 590 is based on Polaris 30 which is a
another revision of the Polaris
architecture that you saw with the RX
for 80 then the rx 580 now there are x5
90 so it's it's a derivative of Polaris
10 Polaris 30 is the product of Global
Foundries 12 nanometer FinFET process
and that means that in general you get
for example a higher frequency sustained
at a given voltage than previously where
you might be able to hit the same
frequencies but require more voltage and
so power efficiency
at reasonable clocks is improved but
really what's happening is the clocks
are being boosted and power efficiency
isn't is is suffering for it but you'll
see some of that in our review so it's a
RiRi fresh of the arts 480 it's
effectively a 580 this is a quote from a
of the entire call with them it is
functionally a 580 with higher clocks if
you're interested in the 598 now that
doesn't mean it's bad it just means that
it's kind of boring from an architecture
standpoint because nothing's changed but
as a product it might be completely
viable will see in our review and of
course look at its value proposition
versus things like the time 60 which at
this point is also a bit lawn on the
tooth and getting not not interested in
a bit old but it will be replaced
probably soon with maybe a gtx 2060 or
something like that we don't have an
official name yet so the RX 590 doesn't
change much but it's a bit faster
highlighted specs here are going to be
the boost and base clocks of 1496
megahertz in 1545 megahertz and a 225
watt TDP and by this time we have our
teardown on lines if you want to check
that out it is up for the XFX Fatboy as
they call it and that's it for this
week's hardware news so we'll have a lot
of sales coverage next week we're gonna
have a lot of end-of-year best of one of
our favorite series series is series to
do or a favorites needs to do end of
year round ups of things like best air
flow cases best CPUs best all that stuff
so we're working on it we have some
really fun coverage recapping the whole
year of reviews that we've done and make
sure you subscribe for that you can go
to store documents access net speak with
sure it like this one one of our mod
mats or any of our other products you
