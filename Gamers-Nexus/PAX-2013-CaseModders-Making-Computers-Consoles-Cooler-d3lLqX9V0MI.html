so I called around to all of my friends
and on the forums on the internet
Facebook and gathered up a dream team of
case modders basically we're going to
sit here and talk about each of the
various different aspects of first
modding some of the works that we've
done and some things that you could do
at home so just to kind of give quick
introductions at the my left your right
we've got Brian Carter odd mots is the
name of this group he is done such
Montes a Traum light cycle I know you
guys are probably you've been to pax
before you probably saw it on the
insufficient for I think I don't think
there's a single guy here that doesn't
have one of their machines down the
exhibition floor or the sum of their
parts down the exhibition for next to
Brian Carter we've got Mike Landon river
and his his neutral zero customs and he
is our expert slaver he's going to talk
about sleeping today and as to him we
got rich surahs' is our master of water
cooling and we'll be chatting about that
and then Bob Stewart I will be talking
about painting lighting and any other
aspects but let me just give you a quick
little overview here um so just kind of
go through some of the works that I've
done if you guys were here last year we
there was a hobbyist panel where I'm
using case modder on that and since I'm
kind of a hobbyist and these guys two
pros will kind of show you some of their
works as well the other thing I'd like
to mention is all of these things up
here or bills either by these guys or
other monitors that we have any audience
the one I'd really like to bring your
attention is the one that we're going to
be donating chow
each and every one of us put together
some parts presenting it to you Kelly so
that she can auction off the doesn't
buzz for hope and every single cent will
be going to chocolate so if you're
interested in the gaming box keep your
eyes open it's going to be this one
right up here in front I EDTA provided
the motherboard I was the c77 for the
win motherboard the video card was
provided by rich I provided the
processor reminding me SSD and the
eventual crucial provided the SSD in the
rain coolermaster and lee harrington
provided the Box lead to the wonderful
paint job and if you get a chance to
swing by BYOC we actually had a case mod
contest up there and Anthony Lackey on
the first place his case is immaculately
just awesome it's this huge white
fitting with custom stiff flying water
cool aluminum piping chrome piping
beautiful sleeping and deserved every
accolade of God but let's go ahead you
start things off so uh right if you want
to take it and go I will pull up the
little skechers yeah my name's Ryan and
I've been good morning for about nine
years i started in 2004 just messing
around for the window and a light in the
case and have a brew much ugh just have
to keep going I came from a hot body
backgrounds
I mean I potential is stupid of our
powers and stuff and in high school so
when we have into the computers it was
just kind of a natural thing to start
souping up the computers getting high
performance parts in there maybe I look
nice so I was going to try and talk
about was kind of the previous part of
case modding and how I get that question
asked a lot is how to come up with
casemod ideas and whatnot and so I might
think about games or movies any kind of
thing but it would be conducive to a
good case mod and when I try and come up
with the idea and not get a concept of
my head I kind of it there's no no
better substitute than a neighbor just
immediately jotting stuff down but
taking the next step to get more of a
people's house that I work on the case I
i use Photoshop quite a bit and just
going through google images to try and
as a paste i'm currently working on the
cruiser case basically just took found
images from google and just a lot of
photoshopping to make it look like what
i wanted it to look like you know once i
get that basic idea of how the things
going to look and I'll go into Sketchup
which is a really cool 3d modeling
program is free google had it on their
site for a while but i think they may
still without to tremble
I think it was so you just Google
Sketchup you'll find it it's free to
download even though they have a pro
version for my plan or 600 bucks but
this is such an easy program to learn
and to create a 3d model of the the case
itself I've done in risk asus and just
using Sketchup for previews and
especially for custom cases it's really
good to come up with the spatial
concerns you know with the with all the
hardware you going to know you know how
it's all going to fit is the case and
sizing is to make sure all the pieces
fit perfectly like I did with the tron
Capeside built that completely into
Sketchup and there's actually a
collection website that has a lot of
Mercy hardware already already made so
we just drop those in all the pieces
that you want and you can set it up it's
really quick and easy say out once i get
all that done and then there's a matter
of actually going building parts that's
pretty much great thanks right so next
we'll go ahead and put my comp spot here
if you want to go ahead and tell
everybody about sleep nice so how many
guys in New York advising girls have
actually heard sleeping or have a good
idea what is his raise your hands okay
so what have half sleeping in itself has
been around for a very long time now the
power supplies that we have now that
come retail we're just starting to get
into the
them starting to be individually sleeved
strength in the factory most of them are
bundled sleep which we've all seen you
know a lot of course at ones and why not
that was actually the beginning and it's
funny how power supply manufacturers
actually went back to the beginning of
how power supplies reused actually
bought them to do that when power twice
first came out they were ugly totally
totally not painted the cables had bunch
o clear beige clips on them and then
there was no sleeping on him whatsoever
so basically the beginning of cables
leaving was retook like a PE t which is
a plastic filament polyester and it was
a very loose braid it was very open it
kind of looked like fishnet and
basically we would put those on power
supplies the beginning monitors would
actually pay power supplies and we had
to do a quick stretch now you can just
go up and you get for me atleast a power
supply and thirty pain black and
certainly done for you it took a while
but eventually individual sleeping came
about and there is 500 different people
that all take credit for being the first
person to do dividual individual
sleeping i couldn't i wouldn't even
start to dare tell you guys who it was
or who did or started it but it has
become a huge trend nowadays whenever
you see a professional mod or any kind
of mark on the show for like you've seen
you know downstairs if you guys have had
a chance to go check out the cooler
master room you'll see that all the
cables are individually sleeved and then
bundled and then not only that but
they're took in in a way that kind of
flows up the case so cable sleeving has
become a tool to kind of more represent
the colors of a case mod more get into
it with the details and more bring a
flow of color what's awesome is that a
lot of monitors if you want to step
further
completely plain case and then their
color element will come from the
sleeping so that PDT has evolved so much
through the years if you guys have heard
of sleeping or been in the sleeping game
when you've probably heard of mtbc at
one point time they get a lot of credit
the owner's name is Neil apopka and
dinner for Germany and he has been
around for a very long time he was the
first really worldwide produced leaving
just for individual sleeping just for
power supplies and it was a very niche
network in through the years it's
developed over and over and over and
over there's different weaves and braids
and I could really get into that but
that really bore you and you guys
probably wouldn't want to hear about
that anyway but if you showed you some
of those pictures you can see how the
different way if you have that brown one
yes if you can see the braids on there
that is actually one of my home that I
came up with and it's called a stiff
lines and you can see the individual
breading the way we use tighter and
tighter so that you can't even see it
now it's been produced so that it's easy
to do heat shrink lists and most of the
beginning when we first started getting
into individual sleeping everything was
done with you drink and if you've ever
worked with it it's tough it's a pain in
the butt it's not fun to work with it
all it's really hard to get straight it
it's very key is sleeping in general is
always going to be tedious but for that
custom look that is the only way they
were going to be able to get it you can
go to the next one and you can see that
the colors have you know evolved with
they go from anywhere from pain to
trying to match components most Cates
motors nowadays what they try to do is
they try to match the components out
already in the system as you can see in
the cooler master one down here
I put red sleeping a red stiff line on
the GPU and if you guys get a chance to
later but underneath de que não sees a
full 24 pin like I had on their rainbow
one of them anyway yeah one of those and
as you can see hello there's different
bins and there's different forming just
like these guys form metal in the same
thing people that sleep or sleepers
myself will do the same thing with the
cable sleeping and it's funny how case
modding is kind of car compartmentalised
that people eat out like myself for
instance just on this and there's people
that do just lighting people that do
just case you know fabrication case
modding in itself is just like an onion
there's a layer upon layer upon layer
upon layer and cable sleepings is one of
those things that add on to the full
aspect of the whole case mod experience
and as this is showed you there's so
many different ways and forms and my
company moved or customs comes out with
different braids we have stiff line
chelios and even Corliss fairport and
it's just going to keep on evolving as
the case or as case mine keeps evolving
and sleepings becomes such a standard
now like I said earlier is this going to
keep involving it to keep being easier
eventually companies are going to start
coming out with color packages like this
in 15 X in a EVGA where we started doing
that because as you get into modding and
as you get into really messing with your
case you know not everybody have the
time to sit down and do full sleeping
like this because you know it's T if
something I got to have a hands for it
and whatnot but as case Monaco it's
leaving this is going to keep you all in
with it that's all I got
cool hey thank you my next to the
bobster if we were skipping right
richest that's the last so I'm going to
talk to you a little bit about painting
and some lighting as well and I he's
going to run a little video of just some
of the builds as I've done so how many
people here do their own painting see
your hands so few so there how many
people think that they can't paint okay
so since I have your hand still go back
up since you got hand them can you go
like this with your finger there's one
guy can't be you know really that's all
it takes you know it starts out with
spray can and you just kind of graduate
up two different things and so before
you know it you'll have a hairbrush area
and they'll be doing all kinds of crazy
stuff but there's some tricks to it
obviously there's a some things you
learn along the way and I got my start I
was on one of enthusiasts like Ryan over
there i restored numerous cars and a lot
of custom paint jobs and stuff like that
and full restorations so you know I just
kind of learned it there and then when I
went to my first land party I saw rich
here had these fancy painted cases and
it just kind of all clicked I thought
I never thought that I could do some of
that you know so there that's how it all
got started but so this is just show
different things that that'd so that you
know just media stuff to dig around
doing things like that at all so forget
started here run too much I want to
recognize a person here a guy that's
helped me quite a bit on some of my
bills here recently and stuffed of his
name is rod Rosenberg he's right here we
stand up he's already a really good
modern everything himself we've been
pretty busy lately with a lot of bills
so he kind of comes and helps me out and
so he knows all my secrets so I security
there's tells everybody everything I
know here so i think that video it
thanks rod for all your girl appreciated
I mean it's not really just help we're
kind of you know we go together stuff
stuff so recognizably so with paint you
know it starts out it's kind of a good
better best really you've got you can
use a spray can you can go you know
whatever store by spring in and do that
or you can you want to go up to a little
better system and you want to buy at
just a cheap spray gun you can use they
have quarts of paint that are like
pre-mixed and also they're ready to
spray so they're already reduced down
things like that
is pretty cheap if you want to go the
best route usually when i use is on what
it painted a curling urethane base coat
fur coat so the only problem there is
it's really expensive like that was
about nine hundred dollars worth of
paint materials aren't there so thread
is the most expensive obviously the one
of the things with paint is you run into
problems it seems like there's maybe one
way to do writing about thousand ways to
do it wrong so if you've ever painted
you may be experienced some weird things
where it wrinkles or runs or you know is
different kinds of things and it has to
do a temperature humidity just you know
maybe applying the wrong kind of primer
first or something like that so just
always read the directions basically and
then you know YouTube has tons of videos
on there and good health videos on how
to you know spray I shot that video
image to the throne one is up there now
is actually down in one of the booths in
stone and those are uh take welts by the
way we you know we had the trolls come
out in full force on some of the
different videos of stuff and they were
commenting on how those were crappy as
well as they never seen
I I took it as a compliment because the
fact that the other real well because
that's when I was calm for so whether
they thought the crappier bearded I
guess it's still a compliment so done
that was just an example of something
where I utilized my former experience
with automotive industry I used a
cognitive seam sealer in a caulking gun
and produce well beats and then just
paint in the airbrush to everything in
there and stuff so yeah just give a nice
effect but yeah Ron I work work really
hard on that when there was a lot of
hours or so but the other thing is
lighting probably the newest trend right
now it's LED strip light and some of our
remote control someone for single colors
or multicolor all kinds of stuff like
that and the thing that's nice about the
RGB LED light strips is that they can be
changed to any color you want and so you
know you're in the mood for blue one day
you turn it to blue if you already have
read whatever stuff but if you're
looking at yeah there's remote controls
there's different ones 2014 44 key that
kind of stuff and also the there's
waterproof and non waterproof and so if
you're looking at purchasing some you
want to you want to pay attention to
what you're getting the there's two
different sizes there's 3528 and there's
fifty biscuits and that refers to the
size of the chip and the 50 50 s are a
little bit bigger chip and they're also
a try led so they have the red green and
blue all built into the one lens so it
produces actual real colors rather than
pulling a red light green light
blue light and blending I mean stuff
like that so but and then there is a
waterproof and non waterproof which you
know in a computer you don't really need
waterproof and let's just spring a leak
you know what our riches are you know
regular eggs yeah it happens so but the
waterproof strips actually they have a
silicone shield own room it does kind of
help make the like low a little bit
nicer so they're typically a little bit
more money but they are a nice system so
i recommended we use those in all of our
bills so dollar perfect thanks Bob and
now we're going to go ahead and go to
the professor here racer oz though
recently accepted a position on doing
chair for information technologies for a
college yeah so it's cool not only do I
get that you can smarter better get some
love teach this modern so we do water
cooling and liquid nitrogen cooling all
kinds of cool stuff in my coma college
but I teach it i GT in same working
chair by key by the way uh my name's
Richard but dude google search for dark
divison if you find some really
embarrassing pictures to hold it against
me there's lots of so we're going to go
a little bit back to the future talking
about case modding overall and this
really goes across the board in the
computer enthusiasts niche we actually
have two groups kind of like Apple of PC
users and to go back and forth and kind
of fight a little bit so we have those
who are going for performance like
overclocking your pc and we have the
church
or for aesthetics but it actually all
started is going back or performance so
if you look way way way back even before
the big issues that Mike was talking
about we had a really nasty wiring and
computers if you remember those IDE
ribbon cables and so if you picture
trying to do wire management with those
puppies the main thing our main problems
besides looking mcnasty is that it
really blocks the air flow and when you
block airflow your computer itself heats
up heats up my tandem how we shut down
so you can't overclock and you can't get
the performance game that you want so
back to the day we had to basically do
origami with that type of wire
management and so they eventually came
out with you know the you know the power
of suppliers that had the bundled tables
and then awesomes does like Mike and
others came up with individual sleep
cables which would out like to actually
route it underneath the motherboard
trailer to hiding and so there was a
paragraph for a while that wire
management was about hiding the cables
not have an invisible that was the
entire goal you're the biggest Pam did
you get higher title your cables you
couldn't even tell they were there then
when people like might come around and
you have you know cables that look like
works of art you're actually able to
know have the cable be part of the
aesthetics of the case and be a
highlight in the feature not something
to hide so that's shows you that modding
is evolved and so we still try to go for
poor performance but you know now
there's kind of like gap between some
people who just want aesthetics and
they're going to go for the pimpest case
you can buy maybe they're going to
scrimp on hardware and it's more like an
art form some people are just 14
spoke when we come to water cooling that
kind of brings it all back in and water
cooling again just like to know what the
wire management was initially designed
for performance so no they make we made
our own water blocks that look like
really get up I know we would use a
heater core some cars I mean it it was
just absolutely ugly but it was cool
because we're different and we got to
increase the performance of our
computers and you're probably wondering
well how does water cooling allow you to
increase performance it's all about
overclocking so when you overclock the
CPU one of the key things that you do is
you increase voltage to the processor
once you increase voltage you increase
heat and at a certain point and that
your computer can just handle it and it
will go into thermal shutdown and so the
overclocking process is a matter of
button you're bumping up in front side
bus and they'll get a little bit of bulb
ditch find out when it's blue straight
me back off a little bit Potter sweet
spot they're good to go the water
cooling allows you to actually pull on
more heat so you can get a better
overclocked at least you know that's how
it traditionally was and so we came up
with all kinds of wild water-cooled
systems and of course there's more
extreme thing if you like phase change
which uses refrigeration to get your
processor down below on ambien and a
liquid
healing but liquid cooling is accessible
by the mainstream most of us can do it
so that's the reason behind it and this
time the time is developed and in a more
manufacturer for paying attention to
those of us remove yourself herbs and
want to have aesthetic just I can see
with the beautiful cables well they've
also developed special products / water
coolness in cooler so you'll have really
nice beautiful water blocks like by UK
company is like Kremlin she'll make
color tubing we just have like a whole
array of products that case modder is
used to have two fat by hand that are
widely available for everybody so it's a
lot easier now to water cool but it
still takes a lot of skill and there's
case mutters have you seen what we saw
was in the other cases we push the
envelope so we use you know water
cooling tubing as flexible it's
beautiful but we still need to push
yambol so we want to do something
different and now we're doing hard lines
they can be metal hard lines and now
we're using acrylic hard lines of you so
you can look at the queen of blades so
you can actually take part acrylic and
you can bend it to be the exact shape
that you want we'll talk about them that
get there so the bottom values that
there's a wide array of products and how
many people here have water cooled
informed i okay so if you have some
options so if your first beginning they
have what they call a io are going so
everything is included you know kind of
like a horse
thermaltake make really nice ones and
those are completely legit they will
allow you to dissipate enough heat from
today's cooler running processors that
you can get a nice i 5 gigahertz state
will over talked with a couple clips of
a bud but if you wanted to go you know
the screw water cooling which is very
vital with separate components there are
so many products available doing
something like this would probably be a
little bit harder for our first timer
but that's something you progress up to
now but you can go to companies like
upper for species and you know just by
all the parts that you possibly want any
color thing that you want no matter what
kind of components you have either pc if
you have you know one cpu on video card
if you have 4-way sli i hope that you do
crossfire right so pretty much no matter
what you want you can buy but there's
some basic things that you should think
about it your water cooling so it's
probably like any of the other project
or types of modding up here number one
is to have a plan so you don't just rush
you out by a bunch of stuff and hey
we're in a crime in this case fire that
puppy up because I've done that before
which creates quite a massive give a
problem so plan plan plan do your
research to come out on Form so how many
people do it from pdx land okay smartest
so you come out to pdx land come out to
the barn notes say that you think about
water cooling and you'll find so much
support to come out just walking through
step by step by step so come out be part
of the community do your research and
then once you go through and you
actually start installing the parts and
take precautions like do a leak test
leak test is very critical that means
that you don't apply a power to your
motherboard you know for the first 24
hours you just jump or your PSU so you
have the pump running and the water
running through your system that could
be installed under components or
are outside your case before handed
depends on how parallel you are do that
so that way you know you count problems
you capturing ahead of time you don't
you don't fry your hardware so once you
do your league chest you have a nice
system built down I'm not going to walk
it you're that kind of beyond the scope
of a short conversation but you have
questions about it in contact paramount
on the forums but what always a try to
instill is if you're going to do this
enthusiast type thing is cool but if
you'll share it and then you know it's
like your fill inside then we know it's
not alright so how many people get lab
parties here okay so the rest of you
should be coming out to LAN parties we
have a BYOC here or probably the best
LAN party on the finiteness PX land so
you come out and show your show your
ring come out to LAN party and make it
work log out on form so how many people
go out on farms here okay so make sure
you come out and you do a work lock and
you share your work and of course if you
go you want to pick a good site so you
don't have trolls ever blaming you
because then you have to go out and kill
them leverage what you've learned and
share let other people learn as well you
know and visit you know we're in that
little niche group as it is and we want
to expand your cyclic packs you know
with you know our table toppers and
gamers and stuff if you look at the
total you know population of the United
States who are smarter too but want to
share it we love it and so lets you know
continue that same thing with the
enthusiast niche you know and hopefully
we'll see more and more custom
co-sponsor professionals like us and
even people like you know out on the
floor around at the BYOC victory so just
to kind of expand on what rich mentioned
we are community just like packs as a
community or part of the packs community
and in response to that
you like as he was saying go to bed
technet overclocked calm the matsu
monitors ink is another good one that's
what the majority to quit come people go
to and these are places that you can ask
questions find out how things are done
and everybody they're brother and sister
will answer those questions for it so
but that doesn't mean you take the first
answers being the right one yeah so
being the fact that we our community we
want to leave a good portion of this
open for questions answers but before
you all get up we wanted to give back to
the community and if you check under
your seats some of we're going to have
them clips anybody that has a little
clip will get a prize we've got some
sleeping packages we have some bloody
packages and there's this money let you
see so you might want to check that
there so we also have a power supply and
fans oh so after how much strong answer
done oh god you guys let's try a certain
partner they're literally little and
mega I glad you're all set now they have
most efficient ways to low crawl longer
back so if you guys wanna line up for
questions and answers and then if you
didn't find out one of these little
Clips sleep oh yeah left oh so this
should be 1100 but let's go ahead first
person win
I'm not trying to be cool episode HP pub
crawl eyes that nitric so dangerous cool
yes I have to go check out people so he
gave my ton of health article i started
k spotting actually despots but uh and
so it super helpful really appreciated
you do tons of communication work you do
thank you but uh and also anyone who's
looking at sleeping do not do care for
just go straight to md proceedings right
it's so much easier i cracked open it's
terrible when i was going to ask you
about it do you think that we obviously
computers being one of the most
important moments of our lives that
we're seeing this huge rise in case
modding and desk haunting and everything
else because it is like your house your
car one of those giving it fails if
something happens your life goes on hold
you guys see that as a big component of
why we're seeing so much more interest
in really showing off and glamorizing
and customizing the way people use your
gears yeah i think definitely computers
are an integral part of our life and our
generation we have in a totally
different perspective you we really care
about aesthetics and so you know it
allows us to integrate that level of
creativity and we want performance so
whichever you don't bring it all
together so i said i think it will
hopefully keep growing by even with the
with the proliferation of other device
bird like the Nvidia shield it was a
nice handheld that's still if you want
to take that to the full potential of
what do you need a high end pc right
Ryan gaming system and so you're going
to want to overclock that pup your
want to get most bang for the buck and I
think everybody wants to have a
beautiful rig on their desk if you don't
have a window in your rigs and you're
wrong so yeah okay oh thank you to my
back in the day and maybe I remember in
my history wrong but back in the day
every single computer box was the beige
box nowadays I think connection I 12 you
to think case modding and the enthusiast
culture has forced manufacturers to
start doing the more colors and like
you're saying now the power station or
power supplies are coming actually
painted when I do you think the modding
community is having big influence in
that oh we're going to just address it
yes you can still buy the base computer
box there's place in Seattle capri pc
where you can get a negative 70 s
computer case about the size of this
podium and then genuine dollars Mary and
how they might you give it to you but
that's one of those resources that you
can find a girl noble house if you're
not from here you can get
antique-looking cases one of the mods i
did was in an old to tester so I just
shelled out the inside of that actually
that you're judged to that case it was
the first case modding contest I
actually got into and well I didn't
place he didn't actually hit some good
advice for me as well but case questions
yeah actually the bay is a pc one of the
Kings manufacturers just for like a
limited edition went back and get a base
PC because you can't they just don't
come and get anymore as it goes and that
leg Richard was saying here we keep
pushing the envelope so as consumers we
keep demanding different products and if
the hardware manufacturer
keep up is they're always asking look at
the community seeing what people are
doing and then they start bringing out
hardware I mean just like I said the
power supply evolved from being
completely ugly to being something that
you can just pop in and it is completely
completely about aesthetics that's why
water coin is coming all-in-one now so
people can easily get into water and
yeah definitely the more we push the
envelope the more people get into
building the more people have feedback I
would even go so far as to say it any
piece of hardware that you see out there
that's been aesthetically alter to be
pleasing has done been a mod at some
point or another somebody has sat down
and made it look like that a company
took notice but people like it and they
mass-produced it so absolutely but in as
re keep pushing it that just gonna keep
going down that way and I should also
have a lot of the subject consultant
different companies so they saw our case
modding and you know we have this new
commission projects and so we actually
have input on designs and you'll see if
you look at this this case over here
that came out to particular focus on
enthusiasts so they look at some of the
shortcomings in other cases they
designed a case labs designed a pulley
modular case all the panels come off you
can do any top configuration you want so
that represents manufacturers having
their pulse on the community and we're
actually driving innovation instead of
the other way around thank you yeah he
notice just to add like you know
originally there were windows on the
sides and things like that so you know
all the little things we've done through
the years they see you know that the
marketing reps will come to
part of the larger land parties and
things like that and you know they go
through and they see what everybody's
doing and and the more they see of a
certain thing that kind of clue in and
hey we should maybe do that because if
that's what's popular that's what we can
sell and so they do that so back to your
base question remember i showed you get
in case you want to get your trip there
first off I'd like to say thanks to rich
your video with HuskyStarcraft really
introduced okay smiley I just want to
say thank you thank you my question is
how do you feel that 3d printing
technology is going to affect case money
yeah I'm 3d printing technology jocks
are extremely exciting up before to do
any type of customization like you have
to use a CNC mill or router or pleasure
so this actually allows us to at a low
price point to customizations so like no
we use google sketchup and stuff if you
can draw something Google Sketchup you
can explore it and you can 3d print so
anybody can do it so this really huge
allows us to be rapid prototyping as
well so when we're working with
companies we can come up with a design
and we could have another company
actually fabricated that's something
that's more complex or it's a higher
level of a structural integrity but is
as phonetic godsend I'm using it for to
go with the vice products to do some
custom wire management features and
actually i will be using it for a
project i can't say too much about but
it's starcraft and letting all the other
thing about the 3d printing is it like
everything else the technology gets
better and better
we use it so the DPI I don't like of
stuff is just going up and up so the
products are you know that you can put
out or getting smoother and really
refined so so it's just the beginning i
think in now I thought I saw like what's
a target or something is selling 3d
printers the Microsoft Word everything
for pretty cheap so it is until stores
actually have to make robots Allen
that's great so yeah it's just so we
make our own dish we're going I've been
using a 3d printers as well as we passed
up there I've done some aluminum casting
for some of the parts that I've been
doing and a 3d printer is awesome for
making week's lost phone and lost
plastic pours you can basically already
print the string out on the top so that
when you pour the molten aluminum band
into it it actually just burns
everything right out and you have a
custom aluminum heart that you just
print it out of plastic yes and I think
the point where i'll actually be happy
is when I can produce something like
what Barker does by hand and the dream
printer is this venom if you haven't
seen his work this band is I mean I'm
not worthy that is master you know with
a hand carving and they see the tron or
is about sore black Cavill so if we can
finally get to that point to where it
someone like me who doesn't have the
skills that Barker does if I can do what
he does with just my vision and being
able to draw it up then I think that
will make pushed a smoggy to that much
level of a higher level and you know
then he'll have to come up with
something even crazy I step it up
can I do a few rapid-fire resource and
method questions yeah i just might touch
each of you i had i want to strip a case
that's been painted and i'd like to do a
sort of two new green I want to know i
know that's a layer paint job to my
prime is there tape into the recognition
they absolutely hid them you know there
was no way in five minutes I could cover
everything that they're possibly what so
first of all it's helpful to know what
the first layer is I guess you could say
so typically cases come powder-coated
these days so you have to realize that
powder coating it's actually a plastic
absolutely go off of a like anodized
aluminum okay so anodizing is a whole
other process where you can remove the
anodizing but it's very difficult it's
basically it's been chemically
transformed into aluminum oxide is what
the I anodizing is so it's extremely
tough and I did see a DIY YouTube video
of somebody showing how to do it in
their own home and I
tried it and didn't have that great
results but it's basically one of those
were if you took it to a shop that does
that kind of stuff they could probably
remove it for a faster than anything and
the other the other option would be to
sanded down which again because it's
been transformed into what's essentially
aluminum oxide that's the same as my
sandpaper is so you're kind of going to
go through a lot sandpaper yeah getting
it back down at metal is you know the
first step and then you always want to
at least use a primer I personally use a
sealer it's an epoxy sealer because
plastic and metal so like the case
itself the shell is metal the panel's
top in front or whatever are going to be
plastic they actually take pain
differently so it's like if you ever
know some new cars they have the
postorder skins are plastic and we
ourself as metal well if you look at a
metallic painted guard you can see in
the light the color don't look different
and that's because what is know what is
plastic so even though they've been
primed and everything the same way it's
just it's just going to react so but if
you use a sealer or an epoxy sealer if
you can get around that so that would be
the most important thing is if you can
find an epoxy sealer or just a couple
good layers about good primer so and
they start going there so that's
actually the foot so will answer the
rest your questions afterwards but it
just wouldn't get a couple other people
because we're about five minutes here
before would start to happen people get
their presence gentlemen in the learning
community there's a bit of a smaller
niche
who attempts to completely passive
cooling systems and it smoking for very
creative solutions such as mounting
ionic raises in a part of the case while
running every ionized air / electrical
components is not always the greatest
idea I just wondered what you guys saw
as a future for passive cooling products
that are going to be available okay
that's a good question really is up yes
so I pretty much i'll try to see no stay
at the higher cutting edge so like most
my bills have at least a 3g mediums so i
have a higher TDP that i need to deal
with if there's a lot of things that you
could do but let's first passenger
probably worried about not noise and
with the higher quality fans that we
have now lucky even if your queen of
blades with as many fans as i have in
there that's you know extremely
extremely quiet yeah you know I think
you know instead really using passive
cooling you could use we know all in
that forms of a liquid cooling where
you'd have a remote radiator so you can
actually place it on waivers or system
you know you just put disconnects
absolute echnology is changing like
everything else to them and you look at
some of the power supplies now there's
no fan you know it's just so there's
always there's always something in the
works that you know we don't hear never
about right away and you know they're
there in testing and things like that so
you know even if we did know we problem
yeah it's the one good the one good
thing about what's water cooling &amp;amp; air
cooling is the intel and nvidia in
particular have general
job there RND and so the tbp on their
newer components while their higher
power keeps dropping and dropping and
dropping and dropping so if you look at
like the gtx 480 was a hot cup and we
could cook an egg on it but the 680 and
78 is actually running a lot cooler the
same thing we didn't tell the newer
processors in a Moore's law sillim
effect with the increase in transistors
and the shortage of the die size but you
look at the TDP it just keeps going down
and down and down and down so that means
that we don't have to put as much
emphasis on you know removing the heat
and so you could actually probably run
in the computer kc a nice fat school
system and it would actually celebrate
us and as you said yourself to niche
market and you gotta remember water
cooling and everything that's press thus
far has been a niche market at one point
in time they were carbon you know
radiators out of cars and stuff to get
it going and I've seen a lot of passes
cool systems when when that when or if
that will ever hit retail depends on the
amount of people that are initially
interesting to it alright that type of
one more question sorry yes still pretty
come up at catalyst afterwards uses and
I think we also have a business card so
don't really know talk to every type
your question there's a reviled piece of
their starcraft you guys are running to
you copyright or trademark in for me
she's not your babe yes yeah so I can't
talk about too much about things that
are in progress but I just finally got
some art group for event coming up and I
can't say it has been an absolute
nightmare for some company is a really
really really protective other
intellectual property the main thing is
that you knew it you're going to be
selling it for profit I think you guys
can attest to this it can kind of be a
fine line so it's sometimes it's better
to ask forgiveness than permission or
stolen right i know it i usually do it
you know I then I just don't say
anything and then say oh I don't know if
you're making one off the case it may
just make it one of scene then you know
typically they're not going to bother
you about it but if you start making 10
or 20 or 30 trong cases and you know it
Disney probably not come after you well
I think yeah and I think where you run
into issues is there's a difference of
are you just building your own case and
doing some customizations and you know
putting us a name of something on there
or are you hired by one of those larger
manufacturers to build something for
them that they may promote and do things
in Game something from it then you know
if you run into a copyright problems
will become a most likely I think that's
the biggest thing right there but you're
just doing pacing yourself you'll be
fine but somebody's marketing it or
making money for profiting off of it
then you're going to run into problems I
think our biggest problem isn't
necessarily copyrighted sin das i
recently worked on a project where i had
34 in das or different
offer one thing that I was working on
still really can't talk about well I
don't know this but it's always fun to
do those projects and you just mentioned
ndac violated you have a solenoid that
it's like the a bike buzzes oral as you
go talk okay all right thanks for
joining us and if you can get all our
