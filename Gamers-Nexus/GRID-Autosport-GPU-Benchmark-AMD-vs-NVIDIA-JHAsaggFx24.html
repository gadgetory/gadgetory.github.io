Nexus dotnet and today we are
benchmarking grid Autosport the new
racing game made by Codemasters or as
they call themselves the codis grid to
introduce some new graphics technology
that actually the codemaster is
partnered with Intel and the has well
release at the time it was brand new and
they introduced some cool stuff on the
graphics side for example self shadowing
smoke it was it was interesting
technology grid Autosport has continued
the trends they are partnered with Intel
again but it's not that exciting this
time the graphics do look great though
just the partnerships aren't as
exclusive which is good for users of all
hardware in terms of graphics it looks
great but it's very optimized and it's
not that intensive this is actually the
most optimized game I've been chucked so
far in that it will perform very well on
almost any card $100 plus so listing off
the video cards in order of sort of the
low end to the high end we have a 250 X
1 gigabyte card 78-51 gigabyte card
750ti
2 gigabyte card by Nvidia of course an
r9 270x 2 gigabyte device by AMD GTX 770
2 gigabyte r9 290x 4 gigabyte gtx 780 3
gigabyte provided by ZOTAC graciously
and that again in sli so a 2 7 80s
tested in sli and then a gtx 780 Ti 3
gigabyte card so that's sort of the
sweet I tested with that is 9 graphics
configurations for grid Autosport
benchmarking and the results were pretty
good actually it runs very well across
the board unlike watchdogs and titanfall
so that's a very nice change to see
after the atrocity that was watch dogs
is optimization it was it was bad check
YouTube for information on that anyway
let's look at the charts so grid
Autosport has a PC benchmark built into
it I define all the test methodology in
the article linked in the description
below hit that link if you want to learn
how I did this and replicate it yourself
so looking at the performance we'll
start with the high graphics settings
then move to max on a high graphics
settings you can play this game with all
the cards tested here all the way down
to the $100 250 X 1
my card which averaged almost 60fps
averaging almost 60fps is good enough
for me it's good enough for most people
if you're very picky and think that you
can see a difference then great you may
need to buy a slightly more expensive
card but the bottom line here is that
the 250x
at $100 will play grid Autosport on high
settings very reliably on one monitor at
1080p and kind of looking above that the
270x exhibited some very odd performance
on high i retested it the same for the
290x the 290x I thought performed
disproportionately to Nvidia similar
offerings 290x is much more expensive
than the 770 and theoretically should
perform far better because statistically
it is a bit more impressive in that
regard but I think grid Autosport is
optimized for Nvidia devices and that's
why we see this disparity in the way
that it is the 750ti
which performed just below the 270x and
290x and there are odd habits so I have
DT I did very well I always recommend
that card as a budget entry level type
card it's 120 bucks 20 dollars more than
250 X and you get a lot more power and
you also get some features like shadow
play that are potentially interesting to
those who would like to produce the
YouTube content so that's the high
settings
obviously everything above the 290 X and
including the 290x just blew the game
away no problem whatsoever so we won't
even look at those on max settings again
the 250 X is at the bottom this time at
30fps so it's not really a viable option
here the 750 Ti is sort of borderline
viable you could probably do a mix like
a hybrid of maximum and high settings
and play pretty well but you're not
gonna play on all maxed out so do keep
that in mind but you can definitely drop
MSAA or something like that down a
little bit and you'll be at 60fps again
no problem 270x did very well on max
settings it ran at 60 solid and that is
the baseline of what my recommendation
would be if you want to play on max
settings 1080p one monitor it would be
the 270x
770 I do not have a 760 but the 770
performed at 80 fps constant you can
look between the 770 and 270x imagine
that is where the 760 would be so it
would be in the probably 65 to 75 FPS
range comparatively and that gives you
an idea for what it would cost to get
something to do that so what are my
recommendations here I mean obviously we
look at sli with the 780 s it's not even
why would you spend that kind of money
on this but they did well so that's cool
SLI the purpose of testing it was not
just to blow the game away but was to
actually see if there was any micro
stuttering there was not any micro
stuttering SLI performs very well unlike
in watchdogs and titanfall which was
atrocious and you'd be better off
disabling it crossfire I could not test
unfortunately at this time due to
availability of the bench but we will
test it in the future so recommending
cards here if you own a 6s DTI boost you
own a 70 at 50 you own a I don't know
Scala deceiveth 670 yeah any any of
those cards really then you don't need
to buy a new card just for grid
Autosport you'll be fine on what you
have if you don't own a device because
you're building a new system or
something on those lines my
recommendations would be this if you're
okay with high settings and you're on an
ultra crazy budget the 250 X at 100
bucks all day long is the best choice
for this game but if you can afford the
extra $20 for 750ti I would strongly
recommend it because it gives you more
versatility especially with a 2 gigabyte
capacity in other games and it also
gives you a couple of extra features and
it's just more powerful and very power
efficient on the TDP side so 750ti is
kind of my preferred recommendation here
for high settings and you can also push
a hybrid of high and max above that if
you want to max out the game the 270x is
kind of where it starts that performs
pretty well if a bit oddly for the game
the 760 would be my next recommendation
if you want to really start pushing
graphics to their highest possible
settings with Nvidia then the 760 would
be where it's at and that is somewhere
in the $230 range I've looked at run
right now the 270x is $170 7
having these $330 250x is 100 750ti is
120 so that gives you an idea of price
for all this stuff and that is the
benchmark please click the link in the
description below because it has more
information and I wrote it and would
appreciate that you read at least some
of it because it's I mean I think it's
fun so check that out and I will see you
all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
