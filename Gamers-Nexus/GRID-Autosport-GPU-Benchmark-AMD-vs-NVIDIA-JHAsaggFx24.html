nexus dotnet and today we are
benchmarking grid Autosport the new
racing game made by codemasters or as
they call themselves the codis grid to
introduce some new graphics technology
that actually the code masters partnered
with intel and the Haswell release at
the time it was brand new and they
introduced some cool stuff on the
graphic side for example self shadowing
smoke it was it was interesting
technology grid Autosport has continued
the trend they are partnered with Intel
again but it's not that exciting this
time the graphics do look great though
just the partnerships aren't as
exclusive which is good for users of all
hardware in terms of graphics I it looks
great but it's very optimized and it's
not that intensive this is actually the
most optimized game I've benchmarked so
far in that it will perform very well on
almost any card a hundred dollars plus
so listing off the video cards in order
of a sort of the low end to the high end
we have a 250 x 1 gigabyte card 7850 1
gigabyte card 750 ti 2 gigabyte card by
Nvidia of course and r9 270x 2 gigabyte
device by AMD gtx 770 2 gigabyte r9 290x
4 gigabyte gtx 780 3 gigabyte provided
by zotac graciously and that again in
sli so 27 80's tested in sli and then a
gtx 780ti 3 gigabyte card so that's sort
of the sweet i tested with that is 9
graphics configurations for grid
Autosport benchmarking and the results
were pretty good actually it runs very
well across the board i'm like watch
dogs and titanfall so that's a very nice
change to see after the atrocity that
was watch dogs is optimized ation it was
as bad check youtube for information on
that anyway let's look at the chart so
grid Autosport has a pc benchmark built
into it i define all the test
methodology in the article link to the
description below hit that link if you
want to learn how i did this and
replicate it yourself so looking at the
performance will start with the high
graphic settings then move to max on a
high graphic settings you can play this
game with all the cards tested here all
the way down to the 100-dollar 250 x 1
gigabyte card which averaged almost 60
FPS averaging almost 60 FPS is good
enough for me it's good enough for most
people if you're very picky and think
that you can see a difference then great
you may need to buy a slightly more
expensive card but the bottom line here
is that the 250 x at a hundred dollars
will play grid Autosport on high
settings very reliably on one monitor at
1080p and kind of looking above that the
270x exhibited some very odd performance
on high i retested it the same for the
290x the 290x I thought performed
disproportionately to nvidia's similar
offerings 290x is much more expensive
than the 770 and theoretically should
perform far better because statistically
it is a bit more impressive in that
regard but I think grid Autosport is
optimized for NVIDIA devices and that's
why we see this disparity in the way
that it is the 750 ti which performed
just below the 270x and 290x and there
are odd habits 750ti did very well I
always recommend that card as a budget
entry level type card it's 120 bucks
twenty dollars more than 250 x and you
get a lot more power and you also get
some features like shadow play that are
potentially interesting to those who
would like to produce the YouTube
content so that's the high settings
obviously everything above the 290x and
including the 290x just blew the game
away no problem whatsoever so we won't
even look at those on max settings again
the 2 DX is at the bottom this time at
30fps so it's not really a viable option
here the 750 ti is sort of a borderline
viable you could probably do a mix like
a hybrid of maximum and high settings
and play pretty well but you're not
going to play on all maxed out so do
keep that in mind but you can definitely
drop MSAA or something like that down a
little bit and you'll be at 60fps again
no problem 270x did very well on max
settings it ran at 60 solid and that is
the baseline of what my recommendation
would be if you want to play on max
settings 1080p one monitor it would be
the 270x
770 I do not have a 760 but the 770
performed at 80 FPS constant you can
look between the 770 and 270x imagine
that is where the 760 would be so it
would be in the probably 65 to 75 FPS
range comparatively and that gives you
an idea for what it would cost to get
something to do that so what are my
recommendations here I mean obviously we
look at SLI with the seven 80s it's not
even why would you spend that kind of
money on this but they did well so
that's cool SLI the purpose of testing
it was not just to blow the game away
but was to actually see if there was any
micro stuttering there was not any micro
stuttering SLI performed very well
unlike in watch dogs and titanfall which
was atrocious and you'd be better off
disabling it crossfire I could not test
unfortunately at this time due to
availability of the bench but we will
test it in the future so recommending
cards here if you own a 6 SC TI boost
you own a 7850 you own a vital most call
it out eva 670 yeah any any of those
cards really then you don't need to buy
a new card just for grid Autosport
you'll be fine on what you have if you
don't own a device because you're
building a new system or something along
those lines my recommendations would be
this if you're okay with high settings
and you're on an ultra crazy budget the
250 x at 100 bucks all day long is the
best choice for this game but if you can
afford the extra twenty dollars for a
750 ti i would strongly recommend it
because it gives you more versatility
especially with a 2 gigabyte capacity in
other games and it also gives you a
couple of extra features and it's just
more powerful and very power efficient
on the TDP side so 750 Ti is kind of my
preferred recommendation here for high
settings and you can also push a hybrid
of high and Max above that if you want
to max out the game the 270x is kind of
where it starts that performs pretty
well if a bit oddly for the game the 760
would be my next recommendation if you
want to really start pushing graphics to
their highest possible settings with
NVIDIA then the 760 would be where it's
at and that is somewhere in the 230
dollar range i look at at running right
now the 270x 170 dollars
770 is 330 dollars and 250 x is 100 750
Ti is 120 so that gives you an idea of
price for all this stuff and that is the
benchmark please click the link in the
description below because it has more
information and I wrote it and would
appreciate that you read at least some
of it because it's I mean I think it's
fun so check that out and I will see you
all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
