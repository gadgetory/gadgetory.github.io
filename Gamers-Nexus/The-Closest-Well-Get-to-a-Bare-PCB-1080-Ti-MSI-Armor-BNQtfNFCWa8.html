Newegg on Amazon we suspected that the
MSI 1080 TI armor card it might secretly
be an actually good PCV the card seems
to have a gtx 1070 cooler stuck on to
the 1080i GPU and 1080i gaming ex PCB
and so if that's the case we would be
able to modify it and turn the card into
one of the best liquid cooling
candidates of the 1080 TI class as it is
priced at $700 and seems to carry a
custom PCB before getting to that this
video is brought to you by ifixit.com
and the pc essentials toolkit which can
be had for $20 making it one of their
cheapest yet most complete toolkits use
code gamers nexus for five dollars off
to bring that to 15 you can go to
ifixit.com slash gamers Nexus or click
the link below for more information so
we bought the a 1080i armor out of
pocket for 700 bucks from retailer it
found that have this gtx 1070 cooler on
it with maybe some very minor changes
but nothing significant enough to make
it suitable for a 1080 TI card and upon
removing the cooler we found that it is
actually a gaming X PCB a card that we
reviewed and likes for the most part
it's got a good cooler on it the Twin
Frozr cooler on the gaming X and it's
got a good PCB builds we did an analysis
on our channel where he talks out all
the components on the PCB they have not
changed on this one aside from some
minor changes to things like the LDO and
some fan control stuff but overall this
is a gaming X PCB for $50 cheaper which
makes it sort of like a secret purchase
for liquid cooling enthusiasts if you're
not liquid cooling this and you're going
to use it in this configuration it's a
terrible thing to buy and we'll show you
why through this video if you are
planning to modify it however like we
did with this kraken g12 bracket and
just a 5 7 DLC we had lying around then
it's one of the best candidates for
liquid cooling that you can get because
you get a good custom PCB and you get it
for $700 and then you just clip this to
the off to the side somewhere throw it
out whatever it doesn't really matter at
that point this is as close as you can
get to just buying a bare PCB with no
cooler attached to it obviously some
disassembly required so we'll go through
the numbers here we're going to talk
why in its stock state this thing is so
bad at what it's doing on this
particular card and why all of those
reviews that you've seen on Newegg and
Amazon if you've looked at this card
tend to be negative almost always along
the lines of thermals and noise start
out with stock configuration testing we
have our thermal overtime charts the
stock 1080p I armor cards from MSI prior
to our liquid cooling mods with the NZXT
g12
out of box with 1080i armor runs a GPU
temperature of around 77 to 78 Celsius
when left to its own devices this
triggers a fan speed of about 80%
corresponding with a noise level of 46
DBA we'll talk about that more later at
this noise level MSI is managed to
assemble one of the worst performing
cards in both noise and thermal
categories in our tests and they've done
so only by sticking and under-qualified
at heatsink on the 1080i armor if we
look at vram temperatures we're rapidly
nearing 90 Celsius on the measured gddr5
X module near the power component
measuring the hotspot MOSFET in the
center of the VRM we see a temperature
output of around 70 102 Celsius not too
bad let's look at a GN EQ chart to get a
better idea of where things land here's
a comparative chart of GPU temperatures
the armor card is the worst of the AIB
partner models on the bench at 77
Celsius with the Nvidia founders Edition
card performing against the thermal
limit point at 84 C before it starts to
limit the clock this sustained at 77,000
per hours the nose output of about 46
DBA out of the msi armor card whereas
the founders Edition card is running at
a 45 DB a noise output with its auto
configuration an 84 C temperature
although this is not great it shows that
the AIB partner models aren't just
magically better to give an idea for
efficiency versus noise here the asus
strix with its 60 4.8 Celsius
temperature is maintaining this with the
noise output of about 30 8.6 DBA
that's nearly a 2x perceived decrease in
noise with a 12 Celsius reduction and GB
temperature again those things don't
normally coincide we're getting a
decrease in noise by roughly two times
as a human perceives it while also
getting a temperature reduction big deal
there the st2 at
my CX model can be had for around seven
hundred twenty dollars or twenty dollars
more than this armored card and it would
operate at the same temperatures as the
I CX model we're seeing here with the
difference being no emcee use and fixed
fan speeds for both and that puts us at
around sixty nine Celsius load again
it's 42 DV a noise output for this
temperature another non-trivial
reduction over the armor the armor does
okay though in some testing like power
temperatures in that it lands about
center of the pack as you can see in our
power temperature charge this is
expectedly similar to the gaming X the
other msi card using the same PCB other
than a couple of minor tweaks but now
let's take a look at how things go with
the fans fixed for a 40 decibel output
on these types of devices note that
we're going to be using Delta
temperature measurements in this charge
hence the lower temperature numbers
overall that's just because they're a
delta temperature over ambient
configuring the coolers to not exceed 40
DBA places the msi 1080i armor card at
58.6 celsius delta T over ambient which
is the hottest device by a longshot
the next hottest device at this fixed
DBA is the FTW 3 which runs 16 Celsius
cooler than the armor for GPU
temperatures at the same noise level and
11 Celsius cooler power component
temperatures though they use different
vrm designs and then we see another 8
Celsius reduction on the vram
temperatures when measuring the same
module that's placed near the power
components and all of this means that
even with the auto settings giving us
80% fan speeds at 45 to 46 DBA on the
msi armor will still throttle the clock
with the stock msi armor cooler here's a
look at that throttling this frequency
versus temperature and time chart is
produced using the higher auto fan speed
the blue line represents the stock msi
armor card which gives hard right out of
the gauge falling in this power virus
scenario from 1630 megahertz to 1520
mega it's about a 100 megahertz
reduction in the worst of times again
this is a power virus so we're not a
numerating the clock in the same way as
a gaming application would fortunately
we also have those results here's a look
at superposition as benchmarked over a
30 minute burnin period as the card
heats up and it starts hitting north of
70 solidus within just one minute of
testing by the way we immediately drop
clocks this means that we're losing
framerate slowing
down as time goes on and heat rises and
you can see that in this chart as the
frequency dips over time and temperature
rises and just to really drive things
home because msi often challenges
criticism of their products we can look
at a frame rate reduction over time in
this next chart this performance was
logged over about an hour of looping
Metro last light benches we have more
than 64,000 rows of data for this
particular benchmark and that's just for
the same time numbers have the thermals
and we see a performance degradation as
the clock drops and thermals rise it may
not be a huge loss in performance
nothing game ruining certainly and
really nothing you would complain about
in real time however it's an unnecessary
loss you don't need to lose that
performance seen as the gaming X doesn't
experience the same performance
degradation with its superior cooling
there's no reason that this one should
because of the same PCB just with again
we're schooling so that's why you get
that reduction in performance over time
back to the power virus chart though we
can fix that frequency fall off by
putting a better cooler on there let's
do it makes the most sense and use
something like a crack in G 12 with an
eighth tech 570 LC that we had an EVGA
hybrid fan on that liquid cooler and
then see how frequency responds so
that's much better we're now holding
nearly a perfectly flat frequency trend
in fact this is almost identical to the
frequency line we see with the gaming X
that has the Twin Frozr cooler which we
can plot now a gaming X clock aligns
with the g12 NC LC clock on the armor
telling us that provided equal cooling
the cards are in fact equal again this
is a power virus scenario but the whole
point is to stress that thing and see
how temperature is due and the clocks in
the scenario between the gaming acts and
the liquid cooled armor are basically
the same bought it over time it's easy
to see how much faster the liquid cooler
soaks the temperature increase and how
much lower the GPU fat and vram
temperatures are overall the GPU
temperature goes down from 77 Celsius to
just over 40 Celsius
what's that temperatures falling from
around 71 C to around 53 C and vram
temperatures also drastically reduced
here's the GN EQ chart with the noise
controlled to 40 DBA we're at around 20
mm on the liquid cooled version of the
card down from around 50 8.6 Celsius
delta T and significantly reduced on
vram and
pictures at once again if you're curious
about noise from a stock cooler here's
one last look at that this is a plot of
the noise over fan speed ranging from 40
percent to 100 percent fan speeds
showing a pretty stable increase in
noise with each 10% rpm hike we've also
got a comparative noise chart in the
article if you'd like to see how this
compares to other cards and keep in mind
that the GPU when it is fixed with the
stock cooler tends to sit around 80% fan
speed and almost never goes above that
instead it will reduce the frequency and
as always there's a lot more in the
article we've got some FPS numbers in
there just to give a baseline of how the
differences look on the liquid cold
versus the stock cold versions not a
huge difference but enough of one where
again you kind of scratch your head and
say why would they do this to themselves
we also have some extra noise info their
temperature and Pho things like that but
to kind of recap things here what we
have is a really peculiar video card if
you're to buy this card with no
intention to mod it and you want to
leave that cooler on it I would tell you
don't there are plenty of better options
that will cool better be priced
similarly or the same and you're not
going to lose out on performance in fact
you might have better performance
because you're not going to be thermally
limited and in the very least you have
better noise performance which is never
a bad thing now the one place that this
is peculiar as I said is because unlike
other products where we might say don't
buy it
period end of story this one still has
some good purpose and that would be if
you wanted to buy it and mod it so if
your plan is to buy something like the
gaming X because you like the PCB or you
like something about it other than the
cooler you could actually buy this
instead get more or less the same things
and the LEDs and fan controls which the
fan controls are relevant anyway if your
liquid cooling it and stick a looking
cooler on it and you save 50 bucks off
of the MSRP because you're going down we
gave me next to this which is a gaming X
PCB and then you can put that money
towards your liquid cooling setup the
one place this gets weird though is if
you are if you don't have specific
liquid cooling plans or anything like
that then basically you might as well
just buy the gaming acts between the two
options
of armor plus liquid cooling and gave me
X because our plus liquid quotient still
going to cost you more than the 750 of
the game in X however we've reviewed
plenty of other cards so we've got full
roundups the most recent one for you to
check would be our ASU Strix video card
review because that one contains all the
data for all the other 1080 eyes are
reviewed so that would give you a full
picture of everything sort of in the 750
plus dollar market but the armor card
overall basically our conclusion is
don't buy it if you're going to use it
stock because the cooler is no good and
if you want to mod it it's a fantastic
candidate for the cooling if MSI could
sell this thing without a cooler it
seems that they would because that's
basically what this already is you're
there selling it with the cooler that
should be removed and discarded and then
you put your own on there and you've got
actually a pretty good card so that's
all for this one we picked up this card
because of the interesting reviews on
Newegg and Amazon as always if any of
you see stuff like that feel free to tip
us off you can tweet at us at gamers
Nexus with news tips or other things
review requests things like that
subscribe go to patreon.com/scishow and
I stopped out directly or store it out
