and access dotnet and I'm joined by
hardware editor Patrick Stone he goes
and today we're doing a video on what
makes a or actually what makes up a
motherboard we're talking about specific
components on the board so some of our
key topics here we'll be talking about
the PCH or platform controller hub also
the chipset PCI Express and how X 8 X 16
that stuff works and is relevant to you
and then of course the vrm which is what
handles the power phasing so we'll jump
in and start with the vrm or voltage
regulator module and the vrm here is
comprised of multiple chokes and other
devices that Patrick will tell you about
in a moment but at a top level what the
vrm does is steps down the power from
the power supply to a usable voltage
that the CPU can use so your CPU might
be specs for 1.2 maybe you've
overclocked and you have 1.3 volts it's
actually phasing down the 12 volt supply
from the power supply through these
phases here on the board and and
converting it to that more usable
voltage and it's a it's responsible for
delivering cleaner voltage to reduce a
Vedra or voltage drops which introduce
instability in the CPU especially when
overclocking so if you're overclocking
and you have a voltage drop because your
motherboard is lower quality I'm not
delivering clean voltage that can
actually create a blue screen or other
errors so I'm Patrick I'll let you talk
more about the specifics of the VRM
thanks Steve
if you're looking at the phase power
design each of these little phases has
three components the first component
which you can see here are these little
circular devices those are your
capacitors you've probably seen
capacitors before there's nothing new
there but they are one of the parts of a
vrm another part that's right beside
that it says SFC on here the c is for a
choke and the choke is one of the
essential parts of a vrm the SF and this
one just stands for super ferrite and
you can use your elemental reference for
the ferrite and then the the next piece
here underneath this heatsink pretty
cool little dragon type heatsink
underneath there you're going to find
driver MOSFETs driver MOSFETs are a
fancy version of a mosfet which is a
low-power
circuit and the driver MOSFET has three
parts inside of it
one driver I see and then two more
MOSFETs and it's just like an improved
version of the MOSFET so it's just a in
this particular case a really nice vrm
that's going to control that power
reduction I think Steve's going to go
now and give us a little information
about when you're looking at the
motherboard box look at the specs you
might something like eight plus two and
see what is it that was that mean sure
so if you're looking on new AG the
product page or something like that and
you see eight plus two power phase
design or phase power design where you
see four plus one or something in that
range the number preceding the plus is
actually indicative of the number of
phases that the power goes through so on
this board we can actually count the
chokes which are on either side of the
CPU and that tells us how many phases
are on this board so we can see four on
this side four on the top that's eight
so it's the eight plus and then the
number after the plus is how many phases
are dedicated to ram or hyper transport
if you're using AMD or other others
devices that need to step the power down
so over here we actually we have two
phases I think for the memory on this
board might be one I think it's two
though and on AMD boards you'll have one
for hyper transport as well next though
we're actually going to talk about the
PCH or platform controller hub and this
is the chipset this is a very critical
part of your board selection process
when you're using any type of CPU am the
or Intel they both have different types
of chipsets like z87 or h87 or 990 X or
990 FX I'm actually going to let Patrick
go into detail on the PCH and what it
does it used to be the Northbridge and
Southbridge but AMD merged it and
unified it originally intel has taken
that as well they call it the platform
controller hub and these two leases
bridge terminology so I'll let you talk
about the specifics awesome thank you
yeah so you guys are the gamers Nexus so
what matters most is certainly video
games well maybe not
that's that made it that may not be
everything but literally the most
important thing okay yeah it's the most
important thing let's be serious but
anyway so this chipset this platform
controller hub on an Intel board is
certainly going to factor into your
gaming tremendously one of the ways that
it does that is it's going to determine
whether or not you can overclock the CPU
right so we're looking to socket here
and if you have something like let's say
an H series chipset from Intel then
you're not going to have that
overclocking functionality it's going to
be locked
due to that chipset but if you have
something like a Z series then you got
the overclock so selection the chipset
really matters if you want overclock and
get more performance out of your machine
another thing that it has a determining
factor in is these little guys over here
you get your SATA ports right so if you
want to go raid let's say you want to go
raid 0 a striped raid array so you can
get more speed out of say like a regular
spindle based hard disk drive then the
chipset has to be able to support that
and again just check your chipsets
feature set to see if it can do the raid
last thing that I want to go to on a
chipset is this PCI Express the chipset
also plays a role and the number of PCI
Express Lanes that the motherboard can
feature in this case you got like PCI
Express x16 PCI Express X and PCI
Express x1 and so the chipset plays a
role in determining how many lanes of
PCI Express you're going to get and that
is extremely important if you want to
use two graphics cards or three graphics
cards or if you haven't even better
motherboard for graphics cards so all
night ins yet
well maybe GTX 780 TS maybe 780 Ti okay
alright and sounds cool indeed it does
alright but I'm gonna pass back to Steve
now because he's going to go into a
little bit of PCI Express for you sure
so PCI Express as it comes to gaming we
are mostly looking at x16 and X 6 X 8
slots X ones you're generally looking at
things like video capture cards audio
cards generally smaller expansion stuff
that isn't doing heavy duty video work
and then the x16 x8 SAR obviously for
video cards and you can actually count
the number of pins and see if it's X 16
or X 8 and so on this slot we can
physically see that there are half the
pins as on the x16 slot you can actually
see that on the back of the board as
well right there as far as specifics
once again we'll throw to Patrick yeah
so the the reason that the
number of pins here matters and the
reason that the number of lanes matters
is that's that's how many bits per
second you're going to be at a transfer
and so with something like a graphics
card or now we're moving closer to PCI
Express solid-state drives those things
going to be transferring lots of data
per second and so an X 1 slot simply
can't transfer enough data per second
and so we have to move to an X 8 or next
16 and if you want that ultra graphics
in your video game you got have you got
to have the ability to support that sort
of bandwidth that again like we said
earlier is tied back into the chipset
Steve you gonna close it out for us yes
just some consumer advice and buying
advice here to kind of go back through
all three of these components again when
you're shopping from other board first
of all check that link in the
description below for a full article on
picking the best motherboard for you to
quickly recap some of those points
though looking at VRMs when you're
looking for a good phase power design
and a board specifically for
overclocking it differs for AMD and
Intel until you want a little bit more
phases and do you tend to be pretty good
at 6 plus X phases for basic overclocks
you might want to go 8 if you're doing
something more extreme heat sinks are
pretty critical for extreme overclocks
because obviously you're driving a lot
more heat through the mosfet and through
everything else around the CPU so if you
are doing OC and then grab one with heat
sinks if you're not you can probably
lose a heatsink or two looking at the
PCH for Intel your choices are basically
z87 or h87 unless you go with a server
socket and z87 is what we generally
recommend for mid-range to high-end
systems that are doing more overclocking
or need unlocked features or might want
to sli down the road or crossfire h87 is
completely good for any mainstream build
or any budget build where you don't even
care about overclocking it's not a
concern to you go with h87 it'll save
you some money and again full articles
two of them actually on this in the link
below
finally PCI Express don't worry too much
about x16 vertex eight because in
testing at the end of the day a dual x8
or triple x8 config is going to have a
delta of a couple percent between more x
16s like dual x16 if you can even find
one of those boards
an affordable price so don't don't
stress out about dual x16 verse x8 x8
because it's going to be like a 3% Delta
max right and other than that that's I
mean that's pretty much all the buyer
advice we have for you here again check
the links in the description below we
have a couple more videos coming up so
subscribe to the channel if you liked it
and we will see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
