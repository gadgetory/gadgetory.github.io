emergency render tear down and build
series like has this machine our main
render machine in the first part of the
last video had huge issues the pump it
was hitting like a hundred degrees
Celsius or thereabouts and we had to fix
it because was it's a machine down
there's obviously no video work that can
be done so before getting to the
conclusion with all the temperature
results overclocking results all that
stuff this content is brought to you by
Thermaltake and their core p1 tgd
chassis which is a mini ITX form factor
case that's wall mountable and about the
size of a test bench and also just a fun
note I've met several people who think
that their own take is pronounced
thermal talkie so there's a hoist lahat
getting back to the system this one was
a complete rebuild so the core parts are
the same but it was put into a new case
and we chained we overclocked CPU
overclock the GPU and click wood cooled
everything far better than was
originally originally I think was a 550
LC generic Asia tech 120 millimeter
liquid cooler on the CPU and it had
really quite honestly terrible case man
attached to it that was some old antique
fan that I bought years and years ago
but we threw it on because it worked and
obviously did not work for very long
because I think what happened is the fan
failed or it failed to turn on when
restoring from an s3 or s for sleep
state and that meant that the liquid
ended up running based at its max
possible temperature because there was
no cooling apparatus on the radiator so
we end up with a CPU that was something
like 90 to 100 C and the liquid can't be
cooled when the liquid in these eight
tech cooler 10 most liquid coolers is
over 60 or 65 Celsius which is about the
max spec you start having some serious
permeation issues and plenty of other
bad things that happen and by the way
when we turned down that liquid cooler
and maybe even way in it or something to
see if there's any measurable loss of
liquid that'd be kind of cool but that
was a problem we rebuilt it in the
silverstone pmo one case is the case i
was on the review q forever and
it's not going to be reviewed in the
same way now might be reviewed in
different way but we've adopted it for
the bench a few things were pretty
annoying about it to work with you can
see the video for that but overall it's
a good case for this build three fans in
the front if you're hearing any
background noise more than normally it's
because this is on it's a bit loud but
it's quieter than the other systems in
the room so it doesn't really matter
that much and then in terms of cooling
the side now says 980ti hybrid it's
still a Titan X Maxwell card but we've
adopted the EVGA liquid cooling kit for
the 980 I would put on here and that's
improved substantially memory is the
same CPUs the same but overclocked and
now cooled with a thermal take water 3.0
cooler which is another one that I've
had forever which so we finally got to
use that got rid of their fans they
didn't like them and put on Oh some
Animax fan so these are animatics dust
free fans or DF pens which in theory are
supposed to spin right when you turn it
on or off and push dust out of the
radiator but we'll see I don't really
that was my main reason I chose was
chosen because it better but that would
be cool if it works properly because it
would be nice to have less dust which
was an issue with our last build overall
we probably have a negative pressure
setup maybe just barely I try to avoid
that but it is what it is the three
front pens are pushing out their max rpm
the bottom fan is cooling the hard
drives which do get quite warm because
the raid set up in this three of them
stack on top of each other the top two
come in and that air is getting split
between the top radio in the back and
because I was concerned about the back
Raider radiator not getting enough cool
air from the intake I slowed down the
RPM on the tops and so running a bit
slower and that allows more air to be
shared between both radiators so for
results overclocking first of all with
the CPU I was able to hit a I think
about a four point five to four point
six ish gigahertz to overclock maybe 145
on the multiplier 1.3 volts on V core
I'm pretty sure to me 1.25 max I think
about 1.2 volts
and then 45 the multiplier and then base
clock was overclocked very marginally
101 or 102 so we end up just between 45
and 46 for effective multiplier means
we're about 4.5 gigahertz and that's
from 4 gigahertz base and then for the
GPU I was able to successfully get it
110 percent power so extra power we
overclocked about 200 megahertz offset I
landed us at 1450 to point 3 megahertz
and this is Boost 2.0 so it doesn't
fluctuate it's just a hard 1450 to
megahertz for the clock 1951 about 7 on
the memory that's of 450 offset and GPU
temperature stays below 51 Celsius with
ambient at 25 C and that's with a one
point 187 voltage on the GPU and was a
35% vrm fan speed which was really just
my choice because there's no coolant for
the B around otherwise so not bad
overall that's pretty good overclock
1450 megahertz is certainly i esteem
great for any reference card
overclocking in terms of performance
impact not huge so it depending on what
you're looking at for premiere Adobe
premier with the media encoder that they
ship with the product using the mercury
GPU accelerator and playback engine we
end up with about a 4 to 5% again
so for ish four and a half percent and
that was demonstrated when we had one
video the old render time before the
teardown was about 26 minutes and as
before the pump failed by the way and
the new time was about 25 25 and a half
it's about 4 to 5 percent not massive we
can't do a ton with that extra time but
on the blender side for rendering
animations that was a lot a lot bigger
of a deal a cpu rendering time with
blender using the n image that Andrew
made for our testing which has some
interesting
caveat with fur rendering but the CPU
render time is about 14% faster it's
actually worthwhile we go from an old
time of about forty three and a half
minutes to a new time about thirty seven
and a half minutes so that is
significant that's five to six minutes
reduced on a render like that so the the
GP render time not as big of a change
but we still were 7% faster so we went
from about 20 minutes 39 seconds to 19
minutes 6 seconds for the new time and
just to it doesn't necessarily sound
that impressive if you don't render a
whole lot but that's for one frame so
just to put that into perspective if we
render a 30 second animation at 30 fps
30 frames per second
30 seconds 900 frames we're rendering
that let's assume that each frame takes
about 15 minutes so it's not
unreasonable each time frame takes 15
minutes on the GPU to render then we're
looking at something like 225 hours to
render the entire 30 second animation
and that's non-stop rendering for a
couple weeks basically and we've done
that before by the way so that's not an
unrealistic use case with the new
changes we would be at about 16 hours
shorter render time on the GPU alone and
will often render frames at the sort of
high side frames on the GPU low side
frames on the CPU and meet in the middle
because they're each leveraged
independently at 100% load so it seems
to work better that way so we would
reduce our render time substantially for
animations for videos not quite as much
but I guess every minute is not a bad
thing to have if you're working on some
kind of breaking news we don't do that
too often
temperatures overall the GPU is now
always under 51 C it was previously
hitting 77 c during premiere renders
that's with an ambien of 25 and 81 to 83
Celsius which is it's kind of max
temperature where it starts to to hit
the clock of it in down clock it was
hitting that during the
worst-case-scenario renders when the CPU
and the GPU were both hot creating a
high ambien
temperature inside the case tended to
idle around 65 C because of that high
ambient temperature thanks to the bad
cooling solution on the CPU and now
we're looking at 41 °c during premiere
51 C and worst-case scenarios tends to
idolize 32 C with an ambient of 25 not
bad CPU was at 90 Celsius this is when
the pump was working and there was a
hundred when it wasn't working but it
was at 90 Celsius roughly when under
render workloads at 4 gigahertz and now
we're at 4.5 gigahertz with a 66 Celsius
temperature and that's with these three
fans at a lower sort of mid-range rpm to
reduce the amount of air that's stolen
away from the GPU and also to reduce
noise although that's not that reduced I
guess is still allowed system overall of
seven total case fans so that is the
build I think that pretty much covers it
was a it was fun project to do always
starts to do on sort of an emergency
timeline because we need the machine to
do work but came out while overall we're
still running the 49 60 X and still
running the asus rampage for motherboard
because those are great for premiere
better than some of the newer stuff in
that x99 series thank you for watching
