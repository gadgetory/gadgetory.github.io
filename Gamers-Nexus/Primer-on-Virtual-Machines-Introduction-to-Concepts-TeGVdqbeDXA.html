virtual machines and virtualization i'm
joined by patrick stone hello who knows
a lot about this stuff so pretty cool
stuff first off what is a virtual
machine so a virtual machine is a
software creation that uses your
computer's hardware to create a computer
inside your computer computer section
yes several machines are actually really
functionally useful at all absolutely
and virtualization basically as you're
saying if you want to do it with linux
or windows or whatever you basically you
have your host platform and then you
install some software normally to do a
virtual machine VirtualBox Oracle's
VirtualBox is good to use Microsoft has
one called virtual pc and the one that I
think that I probably use more often
than not is the VMware vmware player or
workstation pro that those are all good
softwares and you can download and try
any of them so it trying this is a must
you gotta try so let's let's before
going deep on any of these individual
things let's talk about the top level
why you'd make a virtual machines go
good question yeah the main reason for
me is trying operating systems people
are always asking me about the latest
version of windows or windows server
thing and rather than taking a machine
and wiping the hard drive and
reinstalling the operating system I just
pop open my virtual machine build right
like vmware workstation or vmware player
and i say create new vm and it just
takes up some hard drive space which is
fine and then i just build the operating
system on there which is just the same
as installing the OS on an actual
machine and i have a test environment
alternatively you could let windows 10
install itself repeatedly even though
you've told it to stop that's an
alternative and it's not frustrating at
all Microsoft so yes that is certainly
one use one of the uses that i have is
as sort of a web admin
of a server you want to really isolate
your upload your FTP SCP environment
from your main system that you use every
day because whether or not you're a good
competent computer user the cross-site
scripting means that you can get a virus
from pretty much anywhere yeah and if
you upload files to your own server what
you want to do is isolate on a virtual
machine through your FTP or SCP through
there if you're running Windows and that
will help make sure that there's no sort
of like wormhole opening that a virus
can jump through to get there a protocol
to your server and infect your server
yeah I mean malicious software can
pretty complicated and you why created
an opportunity if you don't have to
write and then on the more user side
there's of course downloading of things
from the internet things so if you
download thins from sites that end in
orent then you generally you do want to
be a bit careful obviously obviously we
can't condone any type of certain type
of downloading but if you are
downloading stuff and you want to give
yourself an extra buffer yeah it's just
like a protection zone often referred to
as like a sandbox testing area one more
good use for virtual machines and this
is oftentimes done in the business world
is compatibility um you might have a
custom-built software program that a
company has that was made for them and
it was made when we were using Windows
XP and now everybody's with the windows
7 and our software that we paid ten
thousand dollars that bill doesn't work
on windows seven right well crap oh
never mind we got virtualization yeah so
there's lots of uses for virtualization
yeah and although you can technically go
through like properties in advance and
try and force the compatibility mode
doesn't always work doesn't always work
especially with games where you there's
all these weird visual artifacts and
things like that so you're running old
games that aren't available remade
through steamer good old games or
whatever that's a good use for it agreed
and then going what's what's your next
one well so I'm thinking like how do we
make this thing work right well what was
required to make virtualization work so
your cps got to support virtualization
right and one of the one of the little
things that can sometimes catch you is
that if you go your motherboard's bios
and you check on the settings for your
cpu you'll see some virtualization
technologies like vtx or v TD and you
don't want you you want to make sure
that those things are turned on enabled
and set it isn't it and that's like kind
of step 1 and then 1 step 2 would be
just like going into your machine and
downloading some type of virtualization
software and then step three is start
trying stuff because it's a sandbox and
the most beautiful thing about
virtualization is it didn't work oh well
delete aha that's yet you just allocate
some disk space and if that's that's
really the whole point of them is that
it's not something you're attached to
mm-hmm so if it goes wrong or if your
buyer your system virtual system gets
nuked by viruses or whatever you just
delete it and it's gone you've just done
the most thorough virus cleansing
possible by deleting its host
environment yeah and another cool thing
too is that virtual machines are very
important like if you want to take your
virtual machine to another location you
just take the virtual machine file put
it on a flash drive walk drive fly
whatever take a train to wherever you're
going and then when you get your
destination load the same software the
virtual machine player on that other
computer take your flash drive plug it
in oh look I have mounted the same
virtual machine that I was using at home
that's a really good point actually
because if you have a development or
production environment you travel a lot
or you've got a company that puts you in
front of different computers every week
whenever that would be a good use case
for that now one thing to note is
virtual machines are more demanding than
just a normal host true so if you're
trying to play games or something on
this really not a good idea yeah yeah so
have this concept in mind there's a host
operating system and then there's a
guest operating system the virtual
machines are the guest operating systems
you allocate resources from your
hardware to the guest operating systems
so if your host operating system let's
say it's windows 7 you're going to need
like two gigs of RAM for windows 7 and
you're gonna need a core for your CPU
let's say you've got a quad
or CPU though and you've got 16 gigs of
ram right all right you can you can say
one core goes to the host OS and two
gigs go to the host OS and then you can
allocate another core and another two
gigs to another guest of us and another
corner to geek so I guess twice so you
can still do that but then think about
this if you want to run games like you
talking about especially triple-a titles
those things going to take up lots of
resources so now the sudden this single
guest OS has taken up tons of resources
if you're trying to run a hardcore game
on a virtual machine right so they're
talking about there's just operating
overhead too yeah and so we're going
about gaming we're talking about you
know mostly make an older games work or
may be making a Linux game work in a
Linux environment when you're when you
have a Windows rest pc or vice versa too
if you prefer to run on linux this is
something a lot of you have asked about
is look what about Linux gaming yeah
well if you do really want to help Linux
gaming I guess you know you
unfortunately have to sacrifice some
compatibility with windows and just
install Linux yeah but if you get stuck
there's things like wine in the past to
sort of worked to neutralize the
environment get these things working or
you can do the virtual machine approach
and this is another great point of
virtualization virtualization is
cross-platform so whether i'm using
vmware or virtual box on a mac or a
linux box or a windows box to the
virtual machine it all looks the same
right now to the host operating system
it looks very different but to the
virtual machine it's like a virtual
machine I got what I got okay that
should be a medium I'm a virtual machine
so a couple very good use is there virus
isolation is always the easiest one for
me to point toward that's certainly what
we use to avoid contamination of
environments if you're testing stuff
maybe you're doing that's me right
testing stuff or you're doing a sort of
free IT work for friends and you want to
test up there that's a good place to do
it too so you don't screw something up
that you haven't recovered exactly this
is what if someone is there another top
bubble you so we can go through so those
are really the main things when you're
talking about you know making things
compatible
and then in addition like maybe working
on things that were older and right safe
zones yeah and and so security test
environment making things get battle
those are really the main things you're
going to write virtual machines yeah so
if you want more information a link to
the description below and patreon link
promotional video to help us out
directly thank you for watching let us
know if you have questions on this stuff
and we'll try and do a version 2 and get
a full series going but yeah pretty cool
stuff very easy to get in to check out
virtual machines vmware Oracle's
virtualbox VirtualBox windows virtual pc
windows virtual pc as your starting
points so we will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
