virtual machines and virtualization I'm
joined by Patrick stone hello who knows
a lot about this stuff so pretty cool
stuff first off what is a virtual
machine so a virtual machine is a
software creation that uses your
computer's hardware to create a computer
inside your computer computer section
yes sir virtual machines are actually
really functionally useful yeah
absolutely and virtualization basically
as you're saying if you want to do it
with Linux or Windows or whatever you
basically you have your host platform
and then you install some software
normally to do a virtual machine
VirtualBox Oracle's VirtualBox is good
to use Microsoft has one called virtual
PC and the one that I think that I
probably use more often than not is the
VMware VMware Player or workstation Pro
that those are all good softwares and
you can download and try any of them so
trying this is a must you gotta try so
let's let's before we going deep on any
of these individual things let's talk
about the top level why you'd make a
virtual machines yeah good question yeah
the the main reason for me is trying
operating systems people are always
asking me about the latest version of
Windows or Windows server thing and
rather than taking a machine and wiping
the hard drive and reinstalling the
operating system I just pop open my
virtual machine build right like VMware
Workstation or VMware Player and I say
create new VM and it just takes up some
hard drive space which is fine and then
I just build the operating system on
there which is just the same as
installing the OS on an actual machine
and I have a test environment
alternatively you could let windows 10
install itself repeatedly even though
you've told it to stop that's an
alternative and it's not frustrating at
all Microsoft so yes that is certainly
one use one of the uses that I have is
as
a web admin of a server you want to
really isolate your upload your FTP SCP
environment from your main system that
you use every day because whether or not
you're a good competent computer user
the cross site scripting means that you
can get a virus from pretty much
anywhere yeah and if you upload files to
your own server what you want to do is
isolate on a virtual machine do your FTP
or SCP through there if you're running
Windows and that will help make sure
that there's no sort of like or wormhole
opening that a virus can jump through to
get to a protocol to your server and
infect your server yeah I mean malicious
software can pretty complicated and you
why created an opportunity if you don't
have to right and then on the more user
side there's of course downloading of
things from the internet things so if
you download things from sites that end
in orange then you generally you do want
to be a bit careful obviously obviously
we can't condone any type of certain
type of downloading but if you are
downloading stuff and you want to give
yourself an extra buffer yeah it's just
like a protection zone often referred to
as like a sandbox a testing area
one more good use for virtual machines
and this is often times done in the
business world is compatibility and you
might have a custom built software
program that a company has that was made
for them and it was made when we were
using Windows XP and now everybody's
with Windows 7 and our software that we
paid ten thousand dollars that develop
doesn't work on Windows 7 right well
crap oh nevermind
we got virtualization yeah so there's
lots of uses for virtualization
yeah and although you can technically go
through like properties in advance and
try and force a compatibility mode
doesn't always work doesn't always work
especially with games where you there's
all these weird visual artifacts and
things like that so you're running old
games that aren't available remade
through Steam or good old games or
whatever that's a good use for it agreed
and then going what's what's your next
one well so I'm thinking like how do we
make this thing work right well what was
it required to make virtualization work
your CPUs got a support virtualization
right and one of the one of the little
things that can sometimes catch you is
that if you go to your motherboards bios
and you check on the settings for your
CPU you'll see some virtualization
technologies like VT x4 vtd and you need
to want to you you want to make sure
that those things are turned on enabled
and set it isn't it and that's like kind
of step one and then one step two would
be just like going into your machine and
downloading some type of virtualization
software and then step three is start
trying stuff because it's a sandbox and
the most beautiful thing about
virtualization is it didn't work
oh well delete uh-huh that's it you just
allocate some disk space and if I mean
that's that's really the whole point of
them is that it's not something you're
attached to mm-hmm
so if it goes wrong or if you're a buyer
your system virtual system gets nuked by
viruses or whatever you just delete it
and it's gone you've just done the most
thorough virus cleansing possible by
deleting its host environment yeah and
another cool thing too is that virtual
machines are very portable like if you
want to take your virtual machine to
another location you just take the
virtual machine file put it on the flash
drive
walk drive fly whatever take a train to
wherever you're going and then when you
get to your destination load the same
software the virtual machine player on
that other computer take your flash
drive plug it in
oh look I have mounted the same virtual
machine that I was using at home that's
a really good point actually because if
you have a development or production
environment you travel a lot or you've
got a company that puts you in front of
different computers every week whatever
that would be a good use case for that
now one thing to note is virtual
machines are more demanding than just a
normal host true so if you're trying to
play games or something on this really
not a good idea yeah yeah so have this
concept in mind there's a host operating
system and then there's a guest
operating system the virtual machines
are the guest operating systems you
allocate resources from your hardware to
the guest operating systems so if your
host operating system let's say it's
Windows 7 you're going to need like 2
gigs of RAM for Windows 7 and you're
going to need 2
or for your CPU let's say you've got a
quad-core CPU though and you've got 16
gigs of RAM right all right you can you
can say one core goes to the host OS and
two gigs go to the host OS and then you
can allocate another core and another
two gigs to another guest OS and another
quarter note to gig so I guess twice so
you can still do that but then think
about this if you want to run games like
you're talking about especially triple-a
titles those things are gonna take up
lots of resources so now all of a sudden
this single guest OS has taken up tons
of resources if you're trying to run a
hardcore game on a virtual machine right
so there's just operating overhead -
yeah and so we're talking about game
we're talking about you know mostly
making older games work or maybe making
a Linux game work in a Linux environment
when you're we have a Windows rest PC or
vice versa - if you prefer to run on
Linux this is something a lot of you
have asked about is look what about
Linux gaming yeah well if you do really
want to help Linux gaming I guess you
know you unfortunately have to sacrifice
some compatibility with Windows and just
install Linux yeah but if you get stuck
there's things like wine in the past has
sort of worked to neutralize the
environment get these things working or
you can do the virtual machine approach
and this is another great point about
virtualization virtualization is
cross-platform so whether I'm using
VMware or VirtualBox on a Mac or a Linux
box or a Windows box to the virtual
machine it all looks the same right
now to the host operating system it
looks very different but to the virtual
machine it's like that a virtual machine
I got what I got
that should be a medium tall machine so
a couple very good use is there virus
isolation is always the easiest one for
me to point toward that's certainly what
we use to avoid contamination of
environments if you're testing stuff
maybe you're doing that's me right
testing software you're doing a sort of
free IT work for friends and you want to
test up there that's a good place to do
it too so you don't screw something up
that you haven't recovered exactly this
what if someone is there another top
level use we can go through so those are
really the main things when you're
talking about you know may
things compatible and then in addition
like maybe working on things that were
older and my safe zones
yeah and and so security test
environment making things compatible
those are really the main things you're
going to write virtual machines yeah so

directly
thank you for watching let us know if
you have questions on this stuff and
we'll try and do a version 2 and get a
