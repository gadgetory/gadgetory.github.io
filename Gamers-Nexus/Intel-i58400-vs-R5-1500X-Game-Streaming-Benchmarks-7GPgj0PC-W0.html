doing lately pertains to live-streaming
while gaming it's a new type of CPU test
where we eliminate any type of GPU
support in the form of encoding and rely
entirely on h.264 encoding through OBS
leaning on the CPU we haven't yet
conducted this for a low or mid range
CPU we've only looked at the i7 the i9
and then the r7
today we're looking at the Intel i5 8400
coffee-like cpu matched against the r5
at 1500 X CPU this is a six core sixth
red chip versus a four core eight thread
CPU with a lower frequency so should
make for a good pairing before getting
to that this video is brought to you by
synergy the software that lets you share
a keyboard and mouse between multiple
systems if you have limited desk space
and multiple computers to command
synergy removes the need for separate
peripherals or a KVM and works as over
the network software use our link below
to get 50% off the home or provision
with SSL both conducting and
understanding stream benchmarks is more
difficult than the usual process of
conducting and understanding just
standalone game benchmarks with
streaming we have a few different ends
of the spectrum to look at on 1/2 you
have the streamer experience that would
be the person playing the game what do
they see from their game in terms of
frame rate and frame latency or frame
pacing and then you have the viewer
experience on YouTube or twitch or
whatever it may be for our testing we're
presently using YouTube that we have
used twitch in the past but right now
we're testing with 1080p 60 for our
streamed output and we switch around
between different h.264 encoding presets
depending on how the test is going
faster has been our go to preset thus
far because when we conducted a survey
of you guys earlier this year we found
that most of those in the audience who
do stream use either fast or very fast
and so we picked the middle and went
with faster today we're going to be
doing a bit of faster but also we'll be
leaning on a super fast in the h.264
preset and for those of you not familiar
with this basically it goes down
terms of encoding quality versus speed
to encode so when you push a frame from
the cpu out to the stream it has to be
encoded and the speed of that encoding
depends on the h.264 preset which you
choose as a user based on how fast your
processor or your GPU acceleration may
be at the very lowest end of quality but
the fastest end in terms of getting the
frames out is ultra fast then super fast
and then I believe very fast faster fast
and medium and then some slower ones
which we don't really get into because
once you get down to medium and below it
enters into placebo quality territory
where something like an i-9 or a
threader trip or CPU might be able to
handle it but it kind of gets
questionable whether you can see that
quality as a user through a stream
though perhaps you could notice it if
you're doing something like hand brake
encoding or something like that where
you're ripping transcoding or encoding
videos not just putting them out to
YouTube where the quality will
eventually be compressed at some level
anyway so that's what we're going
through today how there's a lot more to
this you can check the article linked in
the description below if you want to
read more about the testing approach it
does get complicated but we've really
only listed the critical parts that you
need to know to keep it simple as far as
it can be anyway and ultimately with
streaming you can use it as a synthetic
test but in terms of the received output
to the stream there's only so good that
it can get because you can't push more
than 100% of the encoding target which
is 60 FPS for 1080p 60 and of course
bear in mind that all of these CPU
numbers will look better if you step
down to 720p 60 if for example you are
bottlenecked
on your upload data rate through your
isp rather than bottlenecked by the cpu
but once you get into that territory
basically everything encodes at 100% for
the most part with at least super fast
if not faster so that kind of gets to be
a pointless test because you can there's
there's no measurement beyond 100%
encoded frames it just stops because
that's effectively a perfect output at
that point let's get started with dirt
rally we'll move
Doda in a bit we recently added dota and
have done some work with csgo recently
but dirt rally remains our go-to for
stream tests it's not that a lot of
people are streaming it it's just that
the game is easy to work with and
provides a trustworthy baseline that's
easy to replicate which is what you want
for your baseline at 1080p 60 Altru
settings and advanced blending and a
1080p output to youtube streamed with a
10 megabit per second bit rate and again
faster for the preset we get the results
shown here from OBS the i5 8400 stock
CPU only delivers about 31 percent of
its frames showing that this workload is
simply too difficult for the 6 core to
handle the r5 1500 X priced equivalently
at $190 for each CPU only delivers 7.7
percent of its frames we're not
overclocking today but it is something
to consider for the future we have to
drop from the faster h.264 profile to
better accommodate these low-end CPUs as
our testing thus far has only dealt with
i7s r7 x to 99 or X 399 CPUs and even
overclocking won't help either of them
at this point they're just too slow and
to thread limited to be fair that's the
bigger aspect here as threads matter
when you're dealing with encoding and
gaming because this is clearly not
usable as a streamed output let's just
look at it as a synthetic test for the
starter even with these dismal eat low
encoded frame counts of 31 percent on
the 8400 and 7.7 presenta than 1500 X
which means we're dropping about 69 and
92% of frames respectively we can still
look at the frame delivery Layton sees
the r5 1500 Alex manages to deliver 73
percent of its admittedly very low frame
count within a 16 point seven
millisecond ideal window the 8400
delivers about 56 percent of its frames
in that same sixteen point seven
millisecond window we can't make much of
this just yet but it is something to
keep in mind for the next few charts the
8400 is clearly delivering significantly
more frames than the 1500 X though both
are completely unusable for this
configuration but the 1500 X delivers
its lower frame count more consistently
out of desperation and before dropping
quality we switched to high priority for
OBS this previously worked to help save
the i7 77
kay from general uselessness in a
similar test so it might help here we do
end up delivering 100% of frames from
the i5 8400 with switching the OBS the
high priority but there's a hit to
player side or streamer side performance
look at that momentarily after this
charge the 1500 X manages now to deliver
61% of its frames dropping about thirty
eight point seven percent still somewhat
unusable but also improved we can also
see that again the 1500 X manages to
deliver more in the plus or minus 2%
window of sixteen point seven
milliseconds but it's dropping so many
more frames that it's still a poor match
or this streaming configuration it's
just too much of a workload the player
side FPS chart will help better reveal
whether the higher priority OBS workload
murder is the ability to play and enjoy
the game as we talked about in our r7
1700 and I 770 700 K streaming
benchmarks previously it's possible to
deliver 100% of frames and still have an
awful experience if you're only able to
render for example 30fps or below on the
player side then you obviously have a
lot fewer frames available to encode to
stream then with a 60 + FPS render
output as a refresher these charts
consist of two halves we've just gone
through some of the OBS numbers for the
streaming output the next tab is the
streamer view the game performance and
that consists of FPS charts and make up
the other half of the equation there are
2 FPS numbers per CPU at a minimum
there's baseline performance which is
performance without streaming and only
gaming and then there's streams
performance there might be in some cases
a third option which is high priority or
some affinity performance but that's
less of a concern here baseline FPS for
again dirt rally still the i5 8400
manages 109 FPS average 86 1% lows and
78 0.1% lows we right up against the
limits here the r5 1500 X performs
effectively the same with this video
card and with these settings
this makes the to roughly tied pre
stream note that the 80 400 and 1500 X
are not tied in gaming benchmarks but
this is quite a bit different than those
will publish the full review with those
game
benchmarks shortly hereafter in the
meantime though they're equal pre stream
during the stream at the i-5 8400
outputs 107 FPS average 81 1% lows and
34 fps 0.1% lows it has lost effectively
zero percent of its performance but it's
also failing to output any frames to
stream if you remember correctly from
the previous charge the 8400 was only
successfully encoding 31 percent of its
frames with the 1,500 acts encoding 8
percent of its frames this is
interesting because the 8400 actually
gives the streamer a great experience
but the viewer is getting unwatchable 1
the r5 1,500 X drops more of its frames
falling to 97 FPS average but is still
spending more resources than necessary
on streamer gameplay and not enough
resources on the encoding changing to
high priority for each CPU means we lose
in streamer side FPS but we improve in
coded frame output the i5 8400 is now
giving the player 851 FPS average with
low somewhat dismal at 11 fps 1% and 7
FPS 0.1% this is effectively unplayable
what we do manage to deliver 100% of the
frames to be fair there aren't that many
frames to deliver anymore because at
this point it's just not really usable
the r5 1500 X with high priority does
even worse at 33 FPS average and with
61% of frames delivered so it doesn't
even hit 100% what you're seeing now is
some of the streamed outputs from those
tests we'll let this play side by side
for a moment while I talk through the
next section just to reiterate this test
has traditionally been a mainstay for us
in our limited time with these new
stream benchmarks dirt rally has proved
adequate for most testing and gives us
an easy replicable output with these two
CPUs it's just too much work though they
can't handle it so we'll have to drop
down to an easier setting for mid-range
CPUs like encoding with superfast
instead of faster let's take a look at
superfast vs. faster for video quality
but we'll hold the CPU unveil for a
moment for this particular game
superfast doesn't particularly drop our
visual quality in a noticeable way of
course ignoring the fact that faster is
just stuttering like crazy by the time
it gets to YouTube they really kind of
look the same at least for this game
the actual important part is that
superfast allows us to output to an
actual stream rather than a choppy
slideshow and outweighs any minor
quality differences you could perceive
here's the chart for dirt rally was
super fast with all the same settings
except for h.264 encoding preset which
is again super fast now we're able to
encode 100% of frames at 60fps to the
YouTube stream the r5 1500 X on i-5 8400
both job 0% of frames well gonna have
frame Layton sees we see that the r5
1500 accent codes 53.85 presenta bits
frames within the ideal sixteen point
seven millisecond window which is a 60
FPS refresh we were to divide 1000
milliseconds by 60 fps you get that and
then it's also got seventeen point seven
percent of its frames delivering faster
than sixteen point seven milliseconds
28.5% delivering slower being that
faster is a valueless here you really
just want consistency sort of like vr
gaming doesn't matter you're faster
slower just be there at the right time
as for the I 580 451 point three percent
of its frames are encoded within that
sixteen point seven millisecond window
with 21% faster and twenty seven point
five percent slower both CPUs managed to
achieve a 100% frame encode marker to
their credit but they also achieve that
mark more chaotically there is minimal
precision between each the 51 percent
versus 54 ish percent numbers are so
close that they're more or less equal
especially since we don't run as many
test passes with streaming as we do with
these shorter game tests the good news
is that we are actually able to stream
this game successfully now just with a
lower quality output let's take a look
at streamer side fps and experience
because the two are pretty close so far
the baseline performance remains the
same as previously of course so we're
looking at numbers of roughly 109 FPS
average for each CPU against the limits
are 5 1500 X drops to 99 FPS average 72
fps 1% low and 29 fps your opponent mows
the four core 8 thread r5 CPU is
therefore dropping about 10% in streamer
side performance versus baseline in
order to maintain a fluid output stream
while we're still within playable
territory well within it I 580 400
meanwhile manages to keep nearly all of
its original perform
because the superfast encoding and
gameplay aren't generating enough work
to fully engage and trip up the CPU as
the previous test did it's still a heavy
workload but it's not nearly as heavy
the low frame rates are around where the
1500 X is with a 0.1% frame latency
converting to 32 fps this fits the
profile we've created for all CPUs when
streaming on the host system we lose
consistency in low-end frame latencies
by initiating a stream which means that
ultra-competitive players in games like
csgo or dota 2 may be more sensitive to
the loss using an external capture
system would remove this concern but
subjectively speaking we don't really
notice the difference too often with
this game when dropping just super fast
from faster both CPUs are able to keep
up with both encoding workloads and
gaming workloads the rise in CPU drops
about 10% of its baseline fps to
accommodate the stream while the Intel
CPU manages to hang on and is capped
elsewhere we'll explore this in the dota
test neither is outright superior to the
other in streaming output when we drop
to this quality setting before dota 2
here's a look at power consumption
during the stream benchmarking each CPU
is represented by baseline power
consumption when gaming and not
streaming then further streams of power
consumption after that these power
metrics are taken out EPS 12-volt rails
not at the wall so they are measuring 12
volt power to the CPU the Intel i5 8400
CPU consumes about 29 to 31 watts when
gaming only with the 1,500 X at about 40
to 42 watts ignoring one spike streaming
the CPUs land at 52 to 54 watts of the
i5 8400 when pushing dirt and a 10
megabit per second stream but the RFI
1500 X pulling 64 to 66 watts for the
same workload move on to dota 2 using
the same unplayable settings that we
tested for dirt rally capturing dota 2
at 10 megabit per second with a 1080p 60
output and faster preset made the stream
completely unwatchable we dropped about
98% of frames on both the i-5 and the r5
leaving us with fewer than 3% of frames
and code into the stream successfully so
achieve the high priority resolved this
for each CPU giving us a full 100%
encoding rate but we got lower frames in
game this is revealed when looking at
the FPS chart now the stock 8400 and
stock 1500 X both have a significantly
higher frame rates when no process is
given
priority but the stream is useless so
they have functionally failed the test
84/100 has a baseline performance
ceiling of 163 FPS average with 82 and
40 fps lows the 1500 X baseline is 108
FPS average with lows at 53 and 27
moving to the high prioritization the
8400 manages a 70 FPS average player
site throughput but introduced is
noticeable frame latency that computes
12 FPS 0.1% lows it's loosely playable
in the stream is great but it's just
frustrating enough to demand better
performance you'd want to drop encoding
settings a bit still r5 1500 X meanwhile
just can't keep up at 28 FPS average and
low sub 10 FPS it's not playable despite
the stream encoding all of the limited
frames moving the superfast should be
more realistic streaming with this
version of encoding we're able to output
100% of the frames from both the i-5
8400 and r5 1500 X making them
functionally equivalent as far as the
stream viewer is concerned that said the
r5 1500 X doesn't manage one noteworthy
feet of its frames delivered the CPU
keeps 94.6% of them within plus or minus
2% of 16.7 milliseconds whereas the i5
8400 is closer to 65% as follows
previous trends though they were less
noticeable
we don't yet have enough data to fully
draw conclusions but it may be that when
the rise in CPU is under less stress and
strain for frequency demand its
additional threads are assisting in
frame pacing that's something that the
i-5 lacks in this case but it does make
up for it in speed and gaming instances
looking at FPS the i-5 8400 delivers a
decisive victory here it manages a 59
percent lead over the r5 streaming test
we're at 135 FPS average versus 85 FPS
average part of this difference
contributes to the i5 more chaotic frame
basing and just like with the 7700 K
you'd be best off doing some manual
tuning on the CPU to get the most out of
it we'd recommend some tuning of
affinities on the CPU threat Rison still
manages reasonably well at 85 FPS
average while delivering 100% of the
frames to the stream but the i5 is also
capable of this task the difference is
that the i5 has less precision and you
really should be manually tuning it a
bit to compete with the rise in CPU more
directly the rise
CPU seems to be able to handle frame
pacing a bit better out-of-the-box
as for power consumption the spacing
still favors Intel i5 8400 is pushing
about 4 to 4.1 amps with the r5 1500 is
pushing about 4.8 amps so that's it for
our r5 and i-5 stream benchmark there's
a lot more to do with this streaming is
highly complex there are a lot of
aspects we don't or can't test there are
a lot of other games to test and this
video is dense enough as it is it's hard
enough to run these tests as it is so
we're working on doing more of these
obviously we keep adding them and
iterating on them but just keep in mind
that this isn't fully definitive so
while we can draw conclusions for these
settings with these games as to which
CPU is better at these particular
settings and games it's not enough data
to draw conclusions across the board
because just looking at dirt and dota
alone it's obvious that the two CPUs
kind of trade a little bit in
performance depending on which game it
is and we've seen this in the past with
the i7 s the r7 is thread Ripper and I
nines and things like that so anyway
that's the data for now take it for what
it is it's basically still in kind of
it's a test it's methodological we've
advanced it into the reviews at this
point so it's good data that we trust
but we're still learning as far as what
settings make the most sense for these
types of tests superfast appears to me
what's basically necessary for the IO
fives and our fives
faster is just too hard for them to do
as far as how visible that quality
difference is we're still figuring that
out but it looks like both the i5 and r5
can handle with superfast streaming it's
just that the i5 in some cases does a
bit better the r5 in other cases does a
bit better between frame pacing and
frame encoding and then the i-5 is just
pretty much always ahead in terms of raw
FPS particularly when carrying a stream
simultaneously sometimes massively
sometimes not as much so lots to
consider ideally you don't use either of
these for your stream but you could make
it work if you had to at least a little
bit more than some of the previous cpus
we've tested it's just you really start
tanking the quality
as you move down into these lower court
couch chips particularly so as always
