hopefully they'll its headings are okay
we can't see the screen sort of
monumental first test bench is going
into the new office this is the first
ever real test bench that I bought so
this goes in the office first and this
is our secondary bench for GPU and CPU
testing we also have as we'll show from
another shot from the inside of the car
we have a car full of GPUs and and some
motherboards that are defective that's
what we've got to work with right now
before that this video is brought to you
by NZXT is new h 500 case which we
recently found to have an impressively
effective cooling setup that is entirely
negative pressure when stock the H 500
is the successor of the S 340 and s 340
lead offering that high build quality
that's all steel in glass and kale
management features that are also a top
class for the $70 compact mid tower case
age 500 is a part of NZXT Zanu H series
lineup which also features options for
mini ITX micro ATX and full ATX builds
learn more at the link of the
description below first test bench
first-first I'm first the first
challenger well we're sitting in the
world's most economically amazing chair
to make custom length patch cables not
an ad bought the chair myself I don't
even know what the brand is
yeah we're just making custom links
patch cables to go from the patch panel
to the data switch and then we get a
couple of wall wall ones as well and
then as soon as this gets done we'll
move on and play with that which is much
fun that's the new power supply testing
setup yeah which I'm sure was in a video
at some point yes
and now we're gonna develop testing
methodology should be amazing yes gotta
figure out how to use it and what we're
gonna test stuff like that mmm so I'll
take a bit something's gonna work on
most of that what our um through the
stuff you have on the table for your
your cable making so you have a bunch of
short patch cables yeah and then you've
got just some cable cutters yeah
diagonal cutters and that's just - I
won't once I get my wire to the right
order I'm using t IAE I 568b I just kind
of measure it off stick this guy like
that and then they all cut to the same
length just boom done and then double
check your order orange white orange
green white blue blue light green brown
white brown and if you know it's all
good just kind of slide it in the
connector and make sure it stays in
order and then just before you seal it
up you check one last time because again
you know what I have to do it twice and
then wedge and jam make sure you can see
all the little tips of the copper wires
and make sure that the blue piece is
under the crush wedge when this guy yeah
so what is it this clamps it down
there's a crimping tool yeah so you just
slide the rj45 in push in as you're
doing it and then
pressure down nice now you have a good
to go cable in the stack then just all
the headers right here mmm and that's
where you reason earlier yes to test the
cable and for all of those people that
are looking at those little rj45 is
going oh my gosh those are not the exact
right once we are going to bandwidth
test 10 if we don't get good enough
bandwidth will remake it and we will get
good enough bandwidth yeah it'll be fine
our initial testing showed us that we
would get nothing yeah we're getting 1.1
gigabytes per second and that was with
the same equipment those are the same
equipment and it's basically 10 GB but
it's pretty damn close
yeah so who cares this is our it's
really just to move the tripod more
easily but it does say tripod dolly
Keegan has taken to assigning it a name
but he's not here so we can't tell you
what it is oh oh so you pull with that
okay so what
how does it look we have a ton of fans
Keegan tried to organize them yes no day
before yesterday and we actually had too
many to fit on one shelf or two shelves
or yeah so it's a problem that it's a
problem of depth we can put all the fans
on these shelves but then we can't
actually get to them because these holes
right here we have to reach all the way
back in there so this is the shelf
formerly from the set room that had some
graphics cards and Nintendo figures on
it and we're going to see if we can fit
a bunch of fans on here mostly like this
this we also can't really see the labels
if we take them like this but we'll play
around with it we have boxes for a lot
of them too so maybe we'll be able to
fit them all maybe not the wheels don't
work they're broken
we're gonna test the wheels on the light
tripods works really well I think you're
supposed to maybe like maybe like this
oh these are awesome I'm trying to keep
the 140s on 120s
on separate shelves at least they aren't
very well organized like that's 120 120
140 120 so far but I think as long as we
keep each shelf with one size so you
have a billion of these holy Amelie Bora
fans that don't even have standard fan
connectors on them and the bunch of 180
and 200 millimeter pins that will
probably not go on the shelf but I think
we can fit all the rest of these hey
everyone we're here in the gamers Nexus
nuclear fallout bunker
Keagan unabated it out of a fear of
earthquakes because they're very common
here right here all right so we moved
the light into the studio space we did
our audio testing they're gonna have to
do it again once we had this in so this
comes down now are you working with
Keegan and Patrick to start with that
girl join us in a bit after we get some
footage this is gonna be a pain in the
ass basically have to remove everything
off of it kind of vaguely remember where
it is I'm that important though and then
I numbered the panel's and then we're
gonna have to pull the panels off the
would support beam which some of these
beams were like cracking when I put the
screws in so we'll see if they survived
so yeah
wall comes down now and I guess if one
of my team members will light up their
nuclear fallout bunker hahaha we can a
that hurts a poster we can start putting
some of this stuff in I guess just these
bins to start with you don't need a
fancy high-tech stud finder when your
studs are made out of metal I guess
that's one advantage
well it won't stick right here I mean
like I can feel it but if I let it go
it'll drop mostly but it sticks really
strongly like right here it's six really
well and then it'll be like kind of
light and then really strongly right
there and then really strongly reverse
things yes my method of determining
whether or not there was a metal stud
was to drill into the wall and see if a
screw went into it and it did not and
then Patrick stuck a magnet to it so the
problem here from here is uh
unfortunately these are easy to patch up
still very annoying a waste of time but
and also they're loaded onto the floor
intentionally so they reduce the amount
of effort but the problem here is that
we aren't gonna be able to mount the
wall the way we wanted to into metal so
I have to look at look at what my
options are at this point other than a
bunch of drywall screws or something
like that okay so the walls outer walls
are one our firewalls inner walls
although not firewalls our steel frames
and so we're thinking that wall is
almost certainly a steel frame as well
which means we can't mount the pegboard
to it so at least not the way we wanted
to which was into wood studs so you need
to find another solution because it's
kind
an important thing for the set right now
and it can't can't take the wood screw
approach and apply it to screwing into
steel and it's definitely steel because
Patrick around a magnet Hill Honda and
it sticks so it's not wet in there so we
got to figure out a solution the wood
frame the same thing aboard except with
the wrong number of means that's fine so
I think we can run two beams down to the
floor on either side and just screw them
in and then probably something beam
there and then to support it properly
boom yes I profiled here yep so we've
got our front profile these will support
it one piece of wood on either side so
doesn't tip or fall or whatever and that
should hold it up if we wanted to be
fancy we could put wheels on it but I
think we'll probably just take the
get-it-done approach first yeah if we
really want to I was on later we
couldn't run I think two people to let
that bad way two people could lift it
but we could run we could just glue or
stick some carpet like spray yeah start
slides
yep so it slides just like fix it in
reversed on the bottom right and it's
slightly rounder everybody wanted then
they'll be easy like if you were here
low and wanted to shoot or that we
wanted to set up without you all right
so I'll hold it up it'll be further away
from the wall which is not thrilling but
we would also be able to move it if
we're not crazy about shot we end up
with or if we want to do something
different
these two are gonna be be they're gonna
go up the sides from the floor
and the frame that we have is gonna go
into these
theoretically like I need the products
through suffix everything I say with
theoretically
so end of day something this one is
merging several things together but it's
the most significant stuff so first note
I'm still not wearing to laugh right now
so you're not gonna have the best audio
in the world that's not because the room
sounds bad it's because I'm not wearing
the mic i normally wear so the first
video that features this position will
be a hardware news video so as you'll
see earlier in the video
we tried to mount this to the peg to the
wall there's what we really wanted to do
cousin be pretty easy just drill it into
the studs and mount it up and go and we
were all approved for that and
everything ready to go start drilling
into the studs and realize they were
made out of metal which you probably saw
earlier in the video so which was
confirmed also by Patrick taking a
little magnet but it against the wall
and yes they are metal so on the same
night we worked until why are three til
5:00 or 6:00 in the morning
Keagan Patrick
what 2:30 soon as it was a late night
for everyone we worked basically all day
- and the result is we built just a
quick facade wall because here's the
problem the point isn't do it perfectly
as I'm sure people are gonna be like but
I would have done it this way and it'd
be superior the point was to get it done
and be fine and it is both done and fine
so we built like facade well just a
frame really and mounted the existing
pegboard and frame between the two
stilts or whatever that we have rolling
rolling legs and these need we're gonna
add a couple support beams and stuff
like that but the trouble with moving a
studio is that we moved everything over
here and then discovered that the walls
which I had been led to believe had wood
studs in them actually had metal studs
in them and we didn't want to do
anything involving mutilating metal
studs because none of us are experienced
with it so this was a solution that
could be done pretty quickly get us back
into filming state like immediately
because we were gonna run through our
buffer of videos filming of the house
and then there's no there's nothing left
there so it's not like we can't just sit
around and wait we had to get something
up immediately and I really have you a
bit so the height works that well
because with the table positioned here
we're going to have basically I'm
getting another table and that'll go
over here at some point
so we're gonna have a raising lowering
table on this side we have the Kowal
table back here we've got some room for
workspace and then this big table will
move that way in front of the streaming
set but it's also starting to shape up
streaming sets just a workbench right
now because we move the table over to
film hardware news but the heart the
table can move back over that'll be our
stream set we'll have one of those like
probably autonomous desk is it's going
to tell us what I think four over here
and that takes care of the set area so
the lights are deployed and working all
the lights in the ceiling have been
replaced except for those in the park
corner these lights panel replaced
Keegan is currently sitting at our new
table so this came in today as well I I
mentioned working on until 5:00 or 6:00
in the morning and what I did say had is
that I got a call 758 in the morning
right after I went to bed to come get
this pick this up or let them in to
bring it in so yeah this is actually
pretty sweet it's not in its final
position it's gonna ship that way the
couch that I'm getting is going in here
and when this shifts over it will allow
us to do some pretty cool interview
setups so the plan is to basically AC
just came on so sorry about the audio
but the plan is to basically have the
engineers and guests sit down on an
opposing side like if if we kind of
rotate this 180 degrees have a chair
here a chair here we're facing kind of
45 degrees to the camera so we can look
at each other or the camera without
either angle being a hard angle that
feels or looks awkward so that's really
cool it's also a nice table the bar
height is great for once we move it the
camera will go kind of that corner shoot
this direction and then the video set
will be in the background of it which
will look really cool so also a super
comfortable and it's a good kitchen
table but not too bad on the fine for
this one very happy with it and just
need to move it to the final occasion so
this came in that's news I think back
covers a kitchen area for this room this
is also that needs to be inventoried
still so Patrick's been working on he's
gotten a whole hell of a lot of it
inventoried these do that SSDs power
supply testings kind of getting set up
now so I don't remember which video we
had Sonnen or if he ever made it in for
that video but I set this up with him so
most got very act for voltage control
from the wall voltage control so we can
step it up or down if we wanted to
simulate 90 volts like in some regions
in Japan for example we could do that
and see a power spike
we have load testers all his stuff and
he's gonna stone it's gonna start
working on the power supply test
pathology soon so I think that covers
this room and so it's the case test
bench I guess it's out now that's really
it we haven't made a ton of progress
here yet that will happen shortly
storage is still being finalized but
like everything else I can't fill them
pretty well though check out the fan
system so we originally had fans on this
shelf in here and Patrick will talk
about in this video I think it's gonna
be on this one but when he was studying
it up we kind of realized that as Keegan
filled this shelf of fans it's just it's
too deep so you end up with all this
metal section where they're just
completely inaccessible that's a huge
problem for testing realize we have this
in the background of the old set pulled
it out space the shelves appropriately
and that we have an awesome bookshelf
for fans that just happen to eat
basically exactly the right size so yeah
that's we've gotten separated by 120 140
200 so forth and I'll make it really
easy to grab fans for cases or for fan
reviews and testing power supply is
filling in motherboards filling in this
is all just stuff at this point so
nothing special then all the network
equipment is still being set up so it's
a spaghetti mess of wires right now
we're not done wiring it we have
confirmed that 10 Gigabit Ethernet was
working the cat sticks in the walls is
working great speeds are good and we're
limited basically by our SD card speeds
when we read off lemon odds with an ass
right now the nats is just kind of down
there on the floor for the time being
and we'll get a more permanent setup
later but yeah so router switch all that
stops in here we have the Buffalo 10
gigabit switch up there router other
switch for one gigabit and the internet
so that takes care of that in this room
we just have all the foam out expanding
basically so it's pretty much fully
expanded at this point we can mount it
to the walls in the set room but we're
doing some active testing on
noise perfor so what are the acoustics
like when we're in there before we put
the set wall up before and it's gotten
better by the way that con reverb have
largely gone away and then we're gonna
do more testing with them now up and
then more testing still with the foam
installed and we can have a back-to-back
ABEC comparison which will be pretty
sweet for video so you can see how the
audio levels and the acoustic behaviors
change based on the changes we've made
and your system setup it's the only one
right now so just throw up an ultra-wide
and that monitor is probably gonna move
to a throwable test bench but yeah so
we're we're kind of up and running at
this point so think that pretty much
wraps it up for now
it's been a long why I like a week plus
two weeks more this moves been in I've
been working on it for like six months
now and the actual moving part has just
been obviously abusive because we've
been doing work to keep making videos
and get them up every single day and
also move stuff and try not to miss days
in between so pretty big challenge but
it's all mostly done at this point just
need to finalize inventory all the other
stuff is in and we're getting the set
finalized getting the acoustics
finalized so we're in good shape but
we'll have another update for you at
some point might continue this series -
this isn't the end of the series but we
might continue it with like a GN
improvement vlog as well anyway that's
it for now as always subscribe for more
go to patreon.com/scishow gamers and
axis tops out directly with the moving
expenses and just if you like our stuff
or go to stores our gamers Nexus dotnet
to pick up things like our new mouse
pads that just came in the last couple
weeks these are pretty sweet so monitor
woke up and made noise so the blue
actually came out way more electric blue
than our original sample which is
awesome and the people who ordered them
early and got them have been pretty
happy about that
so thank your pick it up it's on stored
at Gary's excess on net if you're
interested has the sonne border at the
edges so it kind of helps with
preventing any fraying or anything
like that thanks for watching I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
