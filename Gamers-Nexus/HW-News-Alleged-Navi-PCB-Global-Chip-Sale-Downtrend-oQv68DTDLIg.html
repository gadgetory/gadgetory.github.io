hardware news recap this week talking
about some some builds I'd boys news the
potential Navi reference design that was
leaked has been analyzed by our friend
builds I'd from actually hardcore
overclocked he'll be briefly recapping
that rumors about comet Lake using
potentially 10000 series branding and
then a couple of other news items like
rise in an epic sales doubling 7
nanometre slated for third quarter and
global chip sales suffering a massive
sequential decline before that this
video is brought to you by the gigabyte
z 390 ARS master motherboard which comes
equipped with one of the more powerful Z
390 VRMs for heavier overclocks on the
new 9th gen intel cpus the ARS master is
also one of the few motherboards with a
really heatsink this generation
featuring a mix of high surface area
fins and looks oriented hover blocks oh
and it's also got updated rgv
illumination learn more at the link
below
the first news item is from build side
there were leaked images of an AMD PCB
supposedly this is when you're dealing
with leaks just keep in mind that it
could turn out not to be true but this
one looks pretty compelling so
presumably it's a reference design for
some variants of one would assume na'vi
and slated for further discussion at
Computex in a couple weeks from now also
this leaked image or images it gave the
the collective internet something to
speculate about always a healthy thane
resident vrm specialist to build Zoid
has done his take on the as he calls it
baseless speculation on the reference
PCB a couple of items of note here the
images show 8 memory packages
surrounding the GPU and the packages
show a BGA package size of 180 balls on
the ball grid array it indicates
potential use of GDR 6 memory according
to build Zoid the 8 phase that vrm could
be making use of 70 amp smart power
stages and using 2 8 pin connectors the
card likely approaches a 300 watt TDP
anything more than that and as build
Zoid says the card becomes a meme so as
as eloquently pointed out by builder
that does scare people away from going
over 300 watts the screw arrangement 2
also
on the board aligns with what we've seen
of a.m. these blower fan designs as
builds weight aptly pointed out as well
so you'll see this on frontier edition
on Reagan 56 and 64 and the hope is that
we don't see final models using a blower
fan we would strongly encourage you to
check out builds video will link it
below it's also in the show notes and
you can check him out on actually
hardcore overclocking but it's a fun
quick analysis of something that may end
up just being a rumor but it does look
like a bit more than that let's just get
all the rumors out of the way at the
beginning of the show one more for this
show
comet Lake potentially using 10000
series branding and 14 nanometer plus
plus from Intel
the current leak suggests that Intel's
upcoming comet Lake CPUs will be another
extension of the company's 14 nanometer
node following continual difficulties
with 10 nanometer and will also add
another digit in intel's already
convoluted Hawaiian of CPU names the
comet Lake series coming out is rumored
to be using 10000 series branding now if
that remains true we'll see it's it's
really it's not good branding if so so
we we would hope that that would change
but the desktop parts would come with as
many as 10 cores and the comet Lake
microarchitecture is an alleged
successor to coffee Lake and whiskey
lake and SKUs are expected to arrive
sometime in the fourth quarter of the
year not much else is known currently
there will be the core desktop parts
coming in in addition to the lower power
use series comet Lake has expected to
recycle parts of previous architectures
like the IGP from the 9000 series and
may be aspects of sky lake as well next
up is Super Micro Super Micro is a
pretty large motherboard supplier in the
data center enterprise space but has
been making a portion gaming lately
Super Micro has been looking to shift
production outside of China and this is
in a bid to to sort of study the
concerns over Chinese backdoors and
espionage like what I think it was
bloomberg brought up previously so Super
Micro will begin moving production away
from China last year it was the
bloomberg report service alleging that
micros motherboards made in China had
been compromised with a malicious chip
acting as a backdoor to hack Super Micro
customers like Apple and Amazon and
pretty much everybody except for
Bloomberg denied these claims and
initial testing did fail to substantiate
those claims but it hurt Super Micro
nonetheless which is unfortunate if they
turned out to be untrue which thus far
there's been no conclusive proof that
they were true Super Micro if you doubt
their size it is the world's third
largest server supplier and it sits
behind HP and Dell respectively so super
Micron's big company took a big hit from
those allegations and since last October
when Bloomberg's report came out Super
Micro has seen a significant decline in
sales especially in the US according to
the analysts in this story it's possible
at Super Micro could slide into fourth
place which would put it behind Amazon
Super Micro has since accelerated
ambitions of becoming more self-reliant
and has broken ground on a new 65
million dollar factory in tau yen which
is in Taiwan now it's about 40 minutes
away from Taipei where we go to Computex
so that'll be something interesting to
follow up on as it expands rise in an
epic sales Dublin in Andy's first
quarter 2019 earnings report so AMD
reported its first quarter nineteen
earnings whilst also accelerating its
50th anniversary and while the company's
earnings were a bit mixed they were
stronger than anticipated and these GPU
and semi-custom sales were sluggish but
were offset by the doubling of Rison and
epic sales this according to AMD has led
to its sixth consecutive quarter of
market share gained although no metrics
were provided and they also doubled down
on its projection that it will gain a
double-digit market share in the server
market this year
Andy reported at one point two seven
billion dollars in revenue for the
quarter and most importantly reported
increase in margins of 41 percent up
five percent quarter over quarter
Andy is also predicting a one point five
two billion dollar second quarter 2019
driven by the launch of its 7 nanometer
product stack and the CEO Lisa sous at
an earnings call if that AMD will
deliver its 7 nanometre navi and Epic
roam in the third quarter
according to sue
the first Navi based graphics card will
be situated quote below where the Radeon
seven is positioned from a pricing
standpoint knocked over the CPUs sorry
sorry sorry dr. Lisa see that's head it
seems the first round of Navi cards will
indeed address the mid-range segment let
me just I'll just fix those one of these
the 50th anniversary - that was about as
disrespectful as he could get in this
news segments so it looks like they'll
address the mid-range segment the
flagship cards will come later and we'll
have a lot of reporting on this come
Computex which again just a couple weeks
away so stay subscribed to get
subscribed if you want to catch all that
coverage and if you want more
information on AMD sales and performance
you can check our to market share videos
so we have one it just looks at what our
audience buys so you can't extrapolate
to the whole market we're really just
looking at what our viewers purchased so
it's a small section of the market for
sure a small section of a small market
but it's still interesting in CPU land
we've seen AMD actually cross paths with
in Tallinn and he has now jumped ahead
in sales volume to our viewers and
readers and in GPU and AMD is still
struggling not quite as bad as in 2017
with all the cards going to miners but
struggling nonetheless but the upside is
the CPU sales so interesting content
pieces if you haven't seen them
highlighting Andy's bullish server
market expectations is Amazon in another
story as it continues to invest in
Andy's epic platform Amazon Web Services
has announced another epic based
offering for its ec2 or Elastic Compute
cloud instances the new epic powered t3a
is a mix of cost and throughput
according to AWS the new t3a instances
for workloads and not requiring law and
sustained throughput needs but offers
instead burst performance for when those
workloads see a spike in throughput or
usage requirements the t3a joins other
AWS instance is powered by epics such as
the m5 the r5 the m5 ad the r5 ad and
similar instances according to the world
semiconductor trade statistics
organization chip sales have declined
globally by as much as 15
five percent sequentially during the
first quarter of 2019 which marks the
largest decline since 2001 and the
fourth largest decline since 1984 the
semiconductor industry association or SI
a trade group recently stated the
following quote sales and March
decreased on a year-to-year basis across
all major regional markets and
semiconductor product categories
consistent with the cyclical trend the
global market has experienced recently
according to icy insights there have
only been seven quarters where the chip
sales have fallen by more than 10
percent sequentially and that dates back
again to 84 so another quote here from
icy insights states that quotes the
first quarter is usually the weakest
quarter of the year for the icy market
averaging a sequential decline of 2.1
percent over the past thirty six years
but the severity of the first quarter 19
and fourth quarter 18 icy market drop
has started the year off at a very low
level and icy insights also painted a
grim picture for 2019 with a
double-digit decline predicted for the
rest of the year on the second half 19
as marked by a particularly strong
rebound the SI a also called for US
policymakers to draft policies aimed at
bolstering and sustaining the
semiconductor market in a final quote
they stated to help foster growth and
innovation in the semiconductor industry
and ensure continued US leadership in
semiconductor technology policymakers in
Washington should enact measures that
invest in scientific research attract
and retain a top technology workforce
and ensure open markets and strong
protection of intellectual property
speaking of intellectual property and
the lack of intellect whatsoever the
razor toaster is becoming a thing yes
yes it's actually happening the thing
that was supposed to be an April Fool's
joke so razor is 2016 April Fool's prank
which played on a 2012 or 2013 demand
for razor toasters has transcended the
world of pranks and memes and will now
become an actual product and apparently
Razer CEO min Lee Anton actually thinks
it's going to be good
Razer CEO posted the following
on Facebook said all right I didn't
think these guys are going to make it
but they did it was to hit 1 million
likes
and with each razor toaster tattoo being
equivalent to 100,000 likes each they
now have 12 razor tattoos well what can
I say okay I'm gonna stop reading this
quote cuz it's like there's a lot of dot
dot dots and that's a run-on sentence
anyway the point of the quote was that
razor basically said if you can get this
idea of a razor toaster up to a million
likes on Facebook for which every razor
tattoo will count toward the light count
a hundred thousand more points then
we'll make a toaster and there were 12
or razor toaster tattoos
that got them there so anyway the razor
CEO likes the page as well and he claims
he's actually putting together his team
of designers and engineers to design a
razor toaster now if this happens we're
going to review it we don't really
review home appliances or toasters I
make a lot more money doing that
but if we did this would be the start to
it so mark my words if the razor toaster
happens we will not only preorder it and
try to get early sampling we'll buy a
couple other toasters and do a roundup
because razor has a reputation in the PC
industry and we're curious to see if
that reputation will apply in the home
appliance industry
it's just our only request specifically
Josh on our team our only request is
that it has a crumb tray please don't
forget the crumb tray in favor of
underglow green LEDs anyway yeah so
that's happening keep an eye out for it
at some point probably take a couple
years the design but anyway night at
last story anticipates a massive decline
in hard drive shipments for a second or
actually just for 2019 in general Nye
Tech is a Japanese manufacturer of small
precision motors and it expects hard
drive shipments to be especially weak
through 2019 night x supplies around 85%
of all spindle motors that power hard
so that lends a certain amount of
credence to the prediction that the
company expects hard drive shipments to
fall as much as 50% in 2019 according to
the PowerPoint financial presentation
NIDA is preparing for a 50%
year-over-year decline in hard drive
Motor Sales revising its hard drive
shipment forecast from 356 million units
to 309 million units and if you're
thinking that doesn't sound that bad
well-nigh tech is expecting further
downtrend
through the year into next year and is
adjusting its shipment expectations
accordingly as for the 50%
year-over-year decline so they're
looking at a hard drive shipment
forecast 356 million units the 309
million units down to 290 million units
in 2020 but its own sales nie tech is
projecting that it will move from 124
million units in 2018 to 64 million
units
ouch in 2019 and on a positive note
external drives and Nearline storage are
expected to see an increase in sales to
make up for some of that gap so that's
it for this one as well as you can
subscribe for more and again the biggest
show of the year for us is coming up
soon it'll be in Taipei Taiwan for
Computex we'll be out there in the next
couple of weeks coming up really fast
have lots of cool content plans so make
sure you're staying tuned for that and
get hyped to see some of your favorite
youtubers or overclockers on the channel
with us and otherwise store doc here in
