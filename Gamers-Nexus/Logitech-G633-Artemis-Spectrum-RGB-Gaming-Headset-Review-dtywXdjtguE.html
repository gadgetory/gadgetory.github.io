dotnet and today we're looking at
Logitech CG 6:33 gaming headset there
are two versions of this headset the
Artemus spectrum is the brand and then
there's the G 633 and G 933 this is the
633 it is wired the G 933 is a wireless
headset it's got some other features but
all in all it's the same idea same base
package just some interface changes so
we're reviewing the G 633 here today we
previously looked at both of these
headsets in our tour to Logitech's audio
engineering facility and you can see
that content already live on the channel
and on the website posted about a month
ago now so that talks about the design
and engineering process for the G 633
and for headsets in general but today
we're reviewing it reviewing how it
feels how it sounds things like that the
big underline feature of the G 633 is
its pro G driver which is a Logitech
made driver it is 40 millimeters in
diameter and the item that
differentiates it here is the diaphragm
so the diaphragm is the material
covering the driver and it's the
material through which the sound is
transmitted that material impacts the
audio quality it impacts the endurance
of the driver so it's it's critical to
get it correct and what Logitech's done
is basically take a series of materials
and and they've woven it into a mesh and
that makes a thinner diaphragm more
durable so you're getting the thinness
desired to allow for greater sound
quality but you're not theoretically not
sacrificing endurance so that's the pro
G driver we looked at it extensively in
the previous post but that's what's in
here you've got two drivers one per year
in the G 633 and G 933 and then it uses
Doby digital surround and DTS for
simulation of more advanced surround
sound setups the headset has four G keys
on the left ear cup accompanied by a
volume roller and a stowaway mic the mic
automatically mutes when you push it up
but the mic provides the user with an
audible blip and a red LED change to can
that it's muted speaking of LEDs the
headset has RGB LED support for the
usual millions of colors RGB LEDs can be
cycled in various states so that's
breathing or cycling colors or just
solid and they're controlled through
Logitech software which will call LGS
Logitech Gaming software the cable is
fully detachable and Logitech includes a
micro USB to USB PC cable or a 3.5
millimeter cable for phones the headset
has to be toggled for phone use the
biggest item on the spec sheet here is
probably DTS headphone X which is a
technology made by the company DTS and
Dolby Digital surround which is a
perhaps more familiar name to those of
you who have been to any sort of movie
theater or something like that so both
of these simulates surround in the
headset it goes up to 7.1 channels and
that helps you with positional audio so
it's got front left and right speakers
in the corners side speakers back left
and right forward back things like that
but first let's jump in three of you
content with the comfort and then we'll
go into gaming and music so those are
our two main categories outside of
comfort for headset reviews and for the
G 633 Logitech's big marketing point
that they told all of us reviewing the
headset was they wanted to break away
from the good for a gaming headset quote
that a lot of their headsets are given
in reviews so that means they're trying
to be more versatile they're trying to
be good at music movies and gaming and
that's a big list of things to be good
at especially in a field so competitive
for comfort the headset uses relatively
thick foam padding to give you a sort of
distance to your drivers which is
interesting and we'll talk about in the
sound section and it uses the the thick
padding that you find in a couple of
other headsets so it is fairly
comfortable once it's properly seated
the material covering that foam can be a
little bit itchy at times but it sort of
works itself in and gets a bit more
comfortable with age but it does
generally take me a couple minutes at
the beginning of every gaming session to
sort of move it around and get over that
initial feeling and speaking of moving
it around the headset does have a
tendency to slide back a little bit on
me to the down where it's seated it's
always either forward or back
really sit perfectly still but again
after maybe the first five minutes of
the gaming session after I filled around
with it enough it will mostly stay
seated where I want it to and this I
think is a reflection of the shape of
the ear cups they're a little bit more
rectangular and tall than some of the
other headsets we've reviewed that stay
seated a bit better and because of the
sort of weight distribution of the
headset that's why you get that sliding
happening with the initial seat of the
headset but once it's seated it's pretty
good strictly in terms of fit I prefer
the way the game comm 780 fits on my
head a bit better and stay seated but
there are vastly different headsets in
terms of price point aesthetics this is
a lot more advanced aesthetically and
sound output so it's not a linear
comparison in terms of products to buy
but in terms of products that I like the
feel of the game comm does get my vote
for better comfort here the foam pads
that ship with the headset by default
are more of a mesh but you can get a
leatherette foam pad coming in the
future
and that will prevent provide better
sound isolation so anyone who's
traveling will get a benefit from that
if you're on a plane or something like
that but it ships with these and they
are pretty easy to take off the other
item to note here speaking of
customization is the side plates of the
headset you can actually in theory in
the future get a template for this and
then 3d print your own design so if you
want to get rid of that logo or put your
own logo on it or change how it looks
you should be able to do that in the
future that's not live yet but it is in
Logitech's plans Logitech G 633 has
enough power to be dangerous when it
comes to gaming and by this I mean that
the headset is capable of producing
tremendously immersive audio but it
requires a bit of an informed user LGS
the software could probably use better
information conveyance in this regard
especially pertaining to the multiple
DTS and EQ settings better telling the
user why they are there and what they do
and in
scenarios those settings generally make
the best sense as far as the 3d setups
DTS headphone acts proves itself in
games which better simulate a studio so
this would include cockpit based racing
games or space sim games dirt rally and
star citizen are excellent examples of
both of these in dirt rally you can hear
the gravel kicking up into the underside
of the car really well and the audio
positioning changes as the camera moves
about the car which is something that
code masters have done of course but
Logitech's headset works with it very
well with the camera on the hood and
lower to the ground the gravel is louder
and grittier and the engine noise is
more roaring but as we move into the
cockpit more of the exhaust cans
rattling can be heard and you get sort
of a Doppler effect as other cars pass
you by on the track which is definitely
cool to hear and of course you hear this
on any stereo headset but it's amplified
with DTS because it is tuning more
specifically to bring out those sounds
and give them more of a distinct pop an
example of a suboptimal use case for DTS
and OB would be counter-strike go
so using DTS headphone X or doe B in
csgo we're actually detrimental to my
gameplay ability I was worse at
pinpointing audio locations and a lot of
that is because the headphones with DTS
and/or Doby enabled will bring out a lot
more of the environmental ambient noise
when you're playing and you don't want
those things in cs:go all you want is
the most immediate threat you want to be
able to locate that threat you want to
hear the footsteps or the gunshot and
you don't want anything else so Adobe
and DTS will bring out for example the
footsteps of your teammates behind you
or the noises of the things behind you
and csgo is a very linear chokepoint
styled game where you sort of know where
all the sounds should be you know what
time they should be there and you know
what you're looking for with a game like
Halo or Call of Duty these technologies
are actually useful and a lot of the
professional teams will use Dobby
surround and Halo or Cod gaming at
tournaments and that's because those
games are more circular so the Maps
moves with gameplay it's a bit more
alive in that nature my quality is
pretty mediocre on the G 633 I was
definitely a bit let down by it
especially given the price point and the
high-end engineering approach its vastly
superior to hyper X's cloud mic quality
but it falls desperately short of what
even the Plantronics game comm is able
to produce we've yet to find a
quote-unquote gaming headset that
exceeds Plantronics mic quality in the
sub $100 150 dollar price range and
that's because the game comm produces an
output that's closer to the real voice
of the user
whereas this Logitech G 633 mic remove
some of the natural resonance of a voice
and it's attempt at isolating input and
I think that damages quality overall you
lose a lot of the users character when
they're speaking into it put together a
quick clip comparing my $400
professional input set up for field
reporting which is a sin highs around
the 46 reporter mic or something and a
roland ro5 recorder and that's compared
against the Plantronics game comm 788
which is a 50 to $80 headset the
Logitech G 630 $350 headset and the
HyperX cloud which is 70 to $100 today
on which option you buy so have a listen
to that hey everyone this is Steve from
gamers Nexus dotnet and I am presently
demonstrating the microphone quality of
a professional reporter Mike hey Ron
this is Steve from gamers Nexus dotnet
and I am presently demonstrating the
output audio quality of the Plantronics
game comm 788 headset hey everyone this
is Steve from gamers Nexus Donna and I
am presently demonstrating the
microphone quality of the Logitech G 633
gaming headset hey everyone this is
steve from gamers nexus donna and i am
presently demonstrating the output audio
quality of the kingston hyperx cloud 2
gaming headset talking about portability
the headsets not super well-suited for
travel the profile is a bit larger than
more travel friendly same cost audio
solutions but with some of those
solutions like the audio technica stop
you do lose the microphone so that's
sort of where you have to make it this
if you're more concerned about
portability and form factor than feature
set I would still recommend the HyperX
cloud 2 as my go-to travel option it's
fairly affordable and it isolates the
user substantially better for air travel
so if this is something you want to take
on a plane and listen to your phone and
then maybe plug in a mic on the other
side to talk to your friends or whatever
then I would look at the cloud talking
about music dobe and DTS are hit and
miss it depends on what type of music
you're listening to how it's encoded how
well that encoding works with DTS if
you're trying to use DTS so looking at
that there's a lot of different items to
take into account I blind tested myself
here which I actually did for gaming as
well
I found that DTS headphone acts did well
for some types of music like Dream
Theater I have a 5.1 mixed Dream Theater
album it's very progressive
instrumentation and the native sound
mixing coupled pretty well with DTS so I
did like it there and preferred it over
both Dobby and having them both off for
bands like AFI which is a lot more
simple than Dream Theater's music less
complex music I found that DTS
diminished the volume and grit and
vocals which is something that you care
about more in certain types of punk or
rock and they felt like they have less
character to them it's really hard to
explain without just putting the headset
on you but it sounds like there's almost
a little more tin to the voice I don't
want to use that word necessarily but
that's that's sort of the direction it's
going when I'm talking about that even
though I'm saying I wouldn't want to use
DTS or Adobe necessarily for certain
bands certain types of music that
doesn't mean the headsets bad it just
means you turn those technologies off
the headset still produces a very good
noise it's got EQ options if you want
more bass or if you want more travel and
it produces a solid noise for sure when
you're listening but you can just toggle
those options off if you don't want them
so concluding everything everyone pretty
much knows that the audio industry is
shrouded in all kinds of marketing BS
there's thousand-dollar cables that
perform the same as much cheaper
counterparts there's all this marketing
terminology that's confusing at best and
misleading at worst so it's it's a tough
industry to work
and when we're reviewing the headsets we
have to take all the marketing into
account and look at does it perform what
it's actually said it will do and does
it do it well in the case of the G 633 I
think it does do most of what it says
pretty well the DTS support as I've said
in a few times and I was good when it's
good and when it's bad II just turn it
off and the headset has great native
audio performance so it's not a huge
loss the build quality is pretty good it
feels fairly solid you can flex it a bit
as I'll show you here it's got some good
flex it's not gonna just snap if you
bend it like that so that does make it
kind of okay for travel but the one
downside here is its profile is pretty
large so that's a lot of space to take
up and some travel kits but it does have
the strength that you need if you're
gonna throw it around a bit the headset
feels a bit lightweight because it uses
a lightweight construction so if you
want something heavier then that's
potentially not the thing for you the
ear cuffs are fairly meaty when it comes
to the overall feel they're big but
they're not necessarily heavy and one
interesting thing to note is that
because of the extra width here as you
can see on the side of the headset it's
pretty wide and because of that extra
width the drivers are spaced a tiny bit
more away from your ear than in some
other headsets and I actually like that
I feel like it's less hitting me on the
sides of the head so it gives you some
more depth of audio obviously some
travels really fast so are you gonna
notice a millimeter two millimetres of
difference probably not but in terms of
the sound actually having some spacing
from your ear it does feel a little bit
less claustrophobic with the G 633 which
I like I've never really liked Doby
digital surround in any environment any
headset I didn't like them a 787 88 I
don't like it here but that's me I know
that pro gamers will use it and Xbox and
Playstation gaming not something I do
but I know that they use it and Halo and
games like that so there's obviously a
market for it I'm not a big fan just put
that out there but DTS is executing
pretty well it's slacking in some games
it needs to certainly have audio that's
encoded for it audio that's compatible
with it game design that works with it
so sort of try it out if you buy the
headset just toggle it see if you like
it if you
turn it off the headset offers a
powerful audio experience by default
without surround tech and works well for
music and gaming almost equally the EQ
tuning is welcomed and well executed
you've got control over advanced
settings for different frequency ranges
you can tune those comfort needs a lot
of work on the G 633 it's not terrible
but it's a little bit annoying the way
it slides back on your head as you use
it a bit and I did test this on multiple
people it's just not my hair something
like that adding 2 inches to
circumference but I did test it with a
couple of other people and we all had
this problem where it sort of slides
back over time it's definitely annoying
but as I said throughout game and you
kind of fidget with it keep moving it
couple millimeters or happen inch and it
eventually finds a seat and stays there
for the most part there's a lot of
competition at this price point but not
a lot of good competition at this price
point so to give everyone an idea of the
environments for headsets right now the
Siberia v3 is priced pretty similarly
certainly look into that it's got the
LEDs if you like LEDs Corsair it has its
new void headset also an RGB LED headset
and that one's supposed to be pretty
good I haven't really used it enough to
review it yet but we're getting one soon
and we'll talk about it then Corsair
void look into that other headsets would
include the HyperX cloud 2 that's a bit
cheaper it's closer to the hundred
dollar price point but if you're
trending that direction it's worth
looking at it's mic quality isn't great
though it's worse than this so that's a
downside of the cloud the game comm 788
I keep saying it but it is my favorite
sub $100 headset so if you're trying to
spend less than 100 bucks go grab that
other than this steel series 9h is also
worth looking at the 9h the Siberia and
the corsair void would be my main items
that I look at when comparing against
the G 633 so check out reviews for all
those headsets look at the pricing and
see what you like best and if you have
any questions let me know in the
comments below I'll do my best to answer
it either in the comments or in our next
ask of GN episode as you know we do
those now and that's all for this review
