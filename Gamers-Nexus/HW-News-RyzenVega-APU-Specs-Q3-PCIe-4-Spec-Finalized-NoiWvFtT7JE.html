this is our second news video already
for the week
so obviously 1070 Ti is one of them
we're gonna focus a little less on that
because kind of really detailed some of
it there is risin AP you with Vega
inclusion news that's kind of
interesting and AMD q3 earnings Intel
avx-512 support for Cannon Lake PCIe 4.0
spec finalization and then a couple of
new products on the market from a
seasoned Corsair before we get into that
this content is brought to you by the
Thermaltake flow RGB closed-loop liquid
cooler which is a 360 millimetre
radiator plus 3 120 fans that are RGB
illuminated if then we'll take it ringg
fans at that this is a 4.5 done a
stacked pump which one of the faster
pumps you can learn more at the link in
the description below the 1070 t I will
start us off that was officially
announced yesterday at a time of filming
and we primed that announcement with our
teardown of the Vulcan X card from
colorful we also posted the specs on the
website along with the release date
which is November 2nd the 10th so DDI
feels an odd position on the market much
like the 950 or yeah the 950 once did
and it uses the same GP 104 as the 1080
and the 1070 the GPU though is a
cut-down 1080 running 19 SMS instead of
20 and SMS have 128 CUDA cores per SM so
it's just a couple CUDA cores lower than
a 1080 basically this one is branded as
GP 104 300 the 1080 was GPU 104 410 70
is GP 104 200 and it's lots obviously
between those two 19 SMS at 128 CUDA
cores per SM puts the 1070 Ti at 24 32
shaders where the GTX 1080 runs 2560
shaders and the 1070 runs 1920 that
means that the 1070 Ti is much closer to
a 1080 in performance than a 1070 and
that's doubly the case when considering
a reference TDP of 180 watts power
budget will vary per board as usual and
will be the biggest player in
determining overclocking power budget
Headroom we'll look into that more in
the future as we get more cards though
as for other specs the 1070 Ti it loses
8
extra map units and one TPC along with
its amputated SM but keeps the wrap
count and the memory capacity the memory
however is different using gddr5 eight
gigabit per second rather than g5x ten
gigabits per second resulting in a
memory bandwidth deficit of 64 gigabytes
per second on the TI lower that is not
total clocks are marked at 1607
megahertz base the same as the 1080 and
1683 boost the boost clock is 50
megahertz at lower than the GTX 1080s
and partner cards will be forced to ship
at the same base and boost clock as
Nvidia's reference card
this means that out of box performance
will be functionally the same thermal or
power limitations of course
notwithstanding and will fall to user
overclocking to overcome which is
actually permitted by the way this is
clearly a move that's attempting to
counter Andes Vega 56 which is
definitely Andy strongest Vega card
that's shipped negative 56 more or less
usurps Vega 64 and on the process
frontier edition so it's been the one
card we've pointed to out of the Vega
family where we've said this thing
actually competes pretty damn well with
the gtx 1070 which i'm a sharpie - MSRP
is the direct competitor obviously
that's not how things panned out because
of the market and it's how unpredictable
it is right now they get still as
pricing and availability issues the
partner cards haven't made it yet even
the asus one that we technically have is
not even ready for review so Vega is
still waiting which means that this is
an opportune time for Nvidia to push out
a 1070 Ti on what they're trying to do
here is to keep the market attention on
NVIDIA product so while the 1070 TI
doesn't really make much sense from a
consumer standpoint either you well not
all of them can exist you kind of either
have a 1070 TI or a 1080 and it's more
likely gonna be one or the other not
both cards existing at the same time
because the price is so close but we'll
find out the review but the point is
that the discussion now will be well why
would you buy X when you could buy Y
instead of why would you buy sunsetting
when you could buy a bag of 56 it's
gonna be why would you buy a 1070 or a
1080 when you can buy TI or why would
you buy a TI with you by 1080 or a 1070
so Vega 56 starts to fall out of the
argument I think that's what
videos going for more than actual just
straight sales of the 1070 TI it seems
more like keeping a attention on the
three cards that they have all grouped
and clustered around the 56 which from
that aspect we'll see if it works will
see how the 1070 di does in benchmarking
and the review which will be out along
with the release of the card November
2nd so keep an eye out for that one
next up AMD officially announced its
Raven Ridge apu alongside the 1070 TI on
the same day within an hour of each
other the Raven Ridge APU is a quad-core
CPU with a single CCX
rising of course and a Vega IGP jointly
bridged by Andes infinity fabric
interconnect the CPU and GPU can
directly communicate by the interconnect
which does mean that like all other ap
use faster memory is going to benefit
the Raven Ridge apu we lose some cache
with Raven Ridge versus the usual rise
in zeppelins but also gain the IGP and a
modular structure for the CPU as a whole
as opposed to one where the components
are tighter together a total of 640
streaming processors are present on the
town of Vegas to use which should be
coupled with high speed memory for best
effect Raven Ridge is IMC Sports 30 200
megahertz memory maximally and AMD did
provide some of its internal benchmarks
for the apu though note that the
overwatch one is at a 79 percent render
scale of 720p which functionally equates
an iPhone 5 display at 11:36 by 640
regardless the rest of the numbers have
promised for instances where a cheap
discrete GPU isn't an option well look
into this when we have the product in
hand at a chance but it be reasonable to
assume performance would be similar to a
low-end r 5 GPU not the CPUs but the
older r 5 GPUs or a low-end 700 series
desktop GPU maybe something like its own
50 or 550 or something like that as for
and these mobile processors those
include the Rison 7 2700 you now with
higher exif our head room and the r 5
2500 you and the also posted its quarter
3 earnings keeping with the and e news
for a moment this reported a 71 million
net income for the quarter so they are
technically in the black now and for
perspective quarter 3 of 2016 last
year's reporting's for the same period
had an d- 406
for the same metric so to go from
negative 406 to plus 71 looks pretty
good the quarter - 2017 earnings also
for perspective posted a 16 million loss
GAAP or GAAP andy has increased its
gross margins to 35% from 33% up from 5%
in second quarter 2016 and the company
reported a 1.6 billion dollar revenue
last quarter the company reported
revenue of 1.2 billion dollars
relatively stagnant if looking at 3rd
quarter 2016 as well
earnings per share are also out of the
negatives now at 7 cents per share and
of its revenue and the reports 819
million from computing and graphics
which includes both GPU and CPU
divisions on the desktop side primarily
and another 824 million comes from
Enterprise embedded and semi-custom
solutions where Andy was focusing for a
while when it did its whole 5 pillars
then looking at cash flow and total debt
and he still has a long fight ahead even
though it was a pretty good quarter for
them as of June 2017 and he has a 77%
23% debt to equity split or ratio of 3.4
for reference Intel's ratio is 0.47 and
Nvidia's is 0.35 and he is on an uptrend
from risin and semi-custom solutions
though which is good news overall they
just have to keep it up going into next
year one final note here there's been
some issues reported with Vega and
destiny to some specific levels in the
game and these aware of the issues as is
Bungie and both of them are working to
resolve them AMD tells us that it's the
highest possible priority Bungie has
also reported that they're working with
AMD to try and troubleshoot why the game
crash is on I think is mission 6 with
the Vega card so that may even be
resolved by the time this video goes up
because they're both looking into it now
as we speak so good news there for
destiny players with Vega
hopefully gets fixed soon and we will
post a short news article on the website
once it is that way if you've stopped
playing you can find it and know it's
time to play again Intel's Nexo avx-512
for Cannon Lake was in the news this was
a story over on an attack where they
talked about the Intel
purported including a baby x5 12:4
cannon lake which is Intel's upcoming
ten nanometer architecture slated for
next year it was delayed out of this
year and that looks like it's gonna be
new instructions from the Xeon skylake
chips including integer fuse to multiply
add commands and as an attack points out
avx-512 support coming to Canada Lake
indicates at larger caches and increased
memory bandwidth but we don't yet know
which kind of Lake CPUs will support
avx-512 it just is in Intel's
programming reference document that you
can get online this isn't much of a
consumer feature today but it's worth
keeping an eye on to see if they have
plans otherwise the next news story
we've been following for a little while
it's PCIe 4.0 so PC is IG has now
released a version 1.0 of the spec last
time we spoke of it was 0.9 that was
released and PC is IG the group
responsible for the PCI interface is
fast tracking both Gen 4 and Gen 5 Gen 5
is supposed to be shipping well not
shipping the spec should be done for Gen
5 in 2019 and then obviously you've got
a bit of a latency there before it's
picked up and actually on motherboards
so probably won't be 2019 but the spec
for 4.0 has hit version 1 now and the
takeaway here same as it has been PCIe
gen for effectively doubles the
bandwidth per Lane so if you have an X 8
slot of Gen 4 it would carry the same
bandwidth as an X 16 or a by 16 slot on
Gen 3 and that means that theoretically
if you're in a band with limited
scenario or you're in a Lane limited
scenario you can run graphics cards on
by 8 and if you're not exceeding
bandwidth on by 16 3.0 which you're
probably not definitely not
then you won't exceed it on by 8 4.0 so
you could run that and then you save
your other lanes for other things like
dual nvme SSD is or whatever the case
may be so that's the main takeaway there
by 16 with Gen 4 just to give an idea
we'll have about thirty one point five
gigabytes per second of bandwidth so
roughly double of what the pcie 3.0 does
finally for new products for the week
asus has the new expedition a 320 M
motherboard for the m4 platform the ACS
motherboard target to East Asia market
primarily with an anti humidity coding
and memory locking mechanisms to prevent
theft and that's because they are
targeting internet cafes on PC Baynes in
Korea the expedition a 320 M has a joint
that locks the back of the motherboard
to the memory slots which prevents the
memory socket from opening without a
screwdriver the motherboard is
specifically built for eye cafes and it
plans to fight damage and corrosion from
humidity with a coating on the board the
expedition runs a six phase vrm off of
the EPS Robo power and host a single
PCIe by 16 slot and the expedition is
mostly noteworthy for its insane color
scheme it's starting to look more like
asrock than a soos at this point the
anti-humidity n-- is also kind of an as
Rock feature so looking like that I
don't know we'll see it in the in the
West but it's a new board from ASOS and
it's got a couple of interesting
features in the lease and then the last
item Corsair slaps tempered glass onto
the speck oh for so that's I mean it's a
speck o4 with glass hot that's what it
is we revealed this back up for if
you're interested in the speck up for
with glass read the spec up for review
and then pretend that we said it had a
tempered glass on it and that's the
opinion that it's the same thing so
check that out if you're interested in
that one otherwise as always subscribe
for more
you got to patreon.com slash gamers and
access to helps that directly reviews of
this thing will be live within the next
week or so and thank you for watching
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
