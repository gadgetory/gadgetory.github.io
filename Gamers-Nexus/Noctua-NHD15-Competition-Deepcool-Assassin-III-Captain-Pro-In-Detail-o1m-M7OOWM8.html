now at CES 2019 looking at just the
coolers for this one so this is probably
the most interesting to you all we've
had requests from you for testing air
coolers for a long time now still in the
works but this is a bit more motivation
to do it because there's a competitor to
the high-end noctua cooler that you all
are familiar with the nhd 15 so this is
the assassin three it's a deep cool
product it's brand new at CES before
that this video is brought to you by us
and the gamers access store you can go
to store it on cameras nexus net to pick
up one of our ceramic mugs critically
acclaimed mod mats or educational video
card tear down and PCB Anatomy posters
that teach the names and placements of
all the key PCB components learn more at
store des cameras XS net or click the
link below and let's get the basics out
of the way first and we'll go into some
more detail on the technical side of
things hundred our price point May is
the release target for this year so it
gives you the very basics about 280 watt
TDP based on their rating I mean it
depends on how the CP is rated of course
whether or not that that works for you
but 280 watt TDP 7 heat pipes and the
heat pipes so some some basic
information here heat pipes we've done
videos in the past we show how CPU air
coolers work and heat pipes of course
they they have a liquid in them as the
liquid comes down to the cool the hot
spot the IHS it will evaporate and come
back up to the top of the heat pipe and
through capillary action it eventually
it'll recondense capillary action brings
it back down and the cycle repeats there
are a couple different types of heat
pipes so there's typically sintered
which is like a copper powder inside of
the heat pipe there's a weave which is a
literal weave of copper inside the heat
pipe a mesh which again a mesh it's
pretty self-explanatory and then there's
a composite which is not only a mixture
of multiple of those different materials
there's not a fixed standard of what
composite always means but this is a
sort of a composite material
it's a sintered and grooved heat pipe so
I think we have some photos of this but
they're basically grooves around the
outer the inner diameter of the heat
pipe and then there's sintered copper
powder inside of the heat pipe so this
is similar to it's it's centered as we
know it mix with some grooves and in
theory the end result is that
should have based on what deep Cola has
told us 15% more thermal transfer now
through testing of course we'll have to
see what that means but that's that
doesn't mean the cooler as a percentage
will perform better
15% it's just individual heat pipes for
thermal transfer as a metric so we're
not talking degrees Celsius here for
overall temperature of the entire cooler
unit versus Knox or something it's just
per heat pipe for thermal transfer
that's the metric we're looking at so
ultimately good advancement it's just
intestine we'll have to see what that
really means in reality it comes with
two fans so these go from 500 rpm to
about 1,400 rpm they're running at full
speed here behind me at 1350 for the
fans and they they're a bit unique
design I think I have one here so the
fan blades have just uh I don't know if
you want to call that a spoiler or
something at the end of it but just it's
it's for an airflow pass through we have
a wind tunnel so we can validate what
that actually does once we get it in the
lab and again with am a release date
shouldn't be too far away for cooler
specs 165 millimeters tall 140
millimeters wide so we've got two 140 s
on there and at $100 those are included
it is supposed to be silence focused 140
helps with that if you want to drop the
RPM obviously that'd be the better way
to get silence and thermal paste
included is a G 15 thermal compound it's
11 watts per meter Kelvin thermal
conductivity which is quite a bit better
than most of the other stock pace that
come with cheaper coolers in the market
to give you an example the ACE attack
thermal paste that comes in the
stockades tech coolers is roughly around
3.8 watts per meter Kelvin so that gives
you a baseline of what to expect I think
cryo knot or Hydra knot is typically
around 11 so it is a high-end paste and
then for the rest I guess I'll mention
this as well it does it does include the
be quiet screwdriver the same supplier
for the screwdriver but that's because
so for mounting points this is a Z
series platform z3 90 and it's got four
screws to one in each corner and then
there's a metal bar that goes across we
did ask about installation because
installation is probably the worst part
of any cooler install and so this one's
pretty straightforward we'll have to
actually install it to understand how
good it is but four screws bars and then
a backplate it's a pretty standard stuff
there
then you got a screwdriver to get down
to those through the fins so next
product there is a liquid cooler we'll
look at and that one's pretty
interesting there's there's a bit of a
difficulty in the market where with
liquid coolers a Sutekh kind of has a
chokehold on pump in the block
configurations basics a stack
successfully sued coolermaster of this
so there are several bypasses and the
captain series uses one of those methods
we'll go look at that next
and on the other side of the room there
are two coolers one of them will be in
the US or globally actually this one and
the other one is not available in the US
because of the AC tech patent so let's
start with the globally available
captain coolers so this is a captain 240
pro deep cool has had the captain series
for a while now differences with this
one you may have heard about there's
just a it's basically a rubber cylinder
in there it's a more or less a balloon
and just burps air when the liquid gets
heated through expansion and contraction
theoretically it should should remove or
evict some of the air from the system
and reduce the chance of leakage we did
ask we saw some of your comments on
potentially I think it was on Paul's the
video actually asking would deep well
warranty the components under the cooler
if it were to leak and the answer is yes
so you know you have to be tested but
that's good to hear the inner diameter
of that that balloon is 14 millimeters
it is basically the length of the
radiator tank so that's the tank on the
end and then all it does is expand
contract based on the liquid temperature
it's a pretty simple system there it's
based on pressure and should in theory
reduce leakage chances the pump itself
it's not a Sutekh design it's not I mean
you've seen the captain before I believe
in some of our previous coverage so same
pump design just the lighting has
changed and then the the pressure
solution on the radiator has changed as
well 240 millimeter radiator pricing is
supposed to be $140 TDP 250 watts and
just if you're curious so these are
propylene glycol mixtures and the
propylene glycol is mixed in with
distilled water typically as the
solution normally with a biocide in
there as well to kill any any bacterial
growth or things like that so the same
type of mixture here is 20% propylene
glycol and the rest you'll have liquid
as typical so this is a pretty standard
mixture we've heard up to 40% on some of
the ASA tech coolers if it goes that
high it's not only for extreme storage
solution so things that are not consumer
higher percentage of propylene glycol
will help with storage and sub-zero
environments for example when I say
storage I mean as in either a service
solution or as in literal storage before
use so ideally you want a bit lower
percentage propylene glycol because
water is going to be your better
transfer of heat it's a good mixture
percentage there we'll see how it
doesn't test in if we do test a 140
bucks like I said the other one if
you're curious is called the castle it's
a 360 won't be available in the US due
to that the patent challenges that we've
seen in the past that have given
Coolermaster and Swift tech some
problems but if you are outside of the
US you might be able to buy it so the
castle is a 360 it is 280 watt TDP and
then $170 for the price point so that
will wrap deep cools booth thank you for
