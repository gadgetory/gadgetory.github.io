Nexus tonight here at CES 2015 we are at
Silverstone sweet right now last year we
showed you their xgo - got a lot of
attention now we're showing you some
mini ITX cases so this is the are vz0 -
this video is brought to you by cyber
powers cyber vapor gaming PC so this
case is a mini ITX case it's pretty cool
it has mirrored side panels so it
actually doesn't matter which way you
put the panels on and up here you can
see they're just either a plastic or an
acrylic window not yet determined and
that shows off the video card which is
installed with a riser card so it's not
a ribbon cable as we've seen in some
other systems this week is actually a
riser card and that way you can install
with the video cards cooler facing
outward and with all the art going into
coolers these days that's sort of a good
thing it will fit up to 11 inches for
video cards so basically every card on
the market you'll have some restrictions
of course being many ITX but you can
figure that out as it approaches release
and speaking of release it's supposed to
be out before Computex which is in June
every year price is estimated below $85
don't have an exact number on that there
are zero case fans pre-installed in this
so it's just using ventilation in the
windows for the video guard and the same
for the CPU because again they're
mirrored panels so it looks the same on
each side in terms of installation
Silverstone's gone for the practical
route as they often do and they're using
tool as installs for the slim optical
drive it uses clips and for the SSDs
which also use clips there are no 3.5
inch mounts in this just two 2.5 inch
mount so you have two SSDs if you want a
storage and a primary drive the power
supply is sfx
will not support larger than that and
and that's pretty much everything for
the system you've got a cool slide down
cover here for your i/o and it's got an
LED on the bottom of it this is a
prototype model so it might look a
little rough around the edges but before
Computex it will be all brushed up and
we'll have more information for you then
so that is the rv0 - the Raven z0 - and
we'll see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
