high-end video card at about the same
price to build our entire high-end
rendering and editing PC when we built
it a bit over a year ago so it's
reasonable to say that they've gone up a
bit some of these are because of
third-party sellers some of it is
because of mining although actually a
lot less than current discourse would
have you believe and some of its just
supply demand and cycles in the industry
annually so this is a revisit of video
we did in July 2017 six months later we
asked the manufacturers and board
partners again how do you feel about
mining before that this video is brought
to you by thermal Grizzly makers of the
conductor not liquid metal that we
recently used to drop 20 degrees off of
our coffee lake temperatures thermal
grizzly also makes traditional thermal
compounds we use on top of the IHS like
cryo not and hydro not pastes learn more
at the link below so to recap the
previous video very quickly we had a few
rules in place for that one this is all
anonymous and aggregate data so that
we've spoken to the board partners to
manufacture as we've spoken to power
supply makers a lot of people who are
indirectly or directly involved in
products that go to miners and we've
asked them for their thoughts either as
an individual or as a representative of
a large company that makes products used
in mining whether they intend them to be
used there or not the point of
anonymizing it is twofold one they
couldn't talk to us otherwise and two it
allows people to speak their minds more
freely the point of aggregating it is so
that it's just a big pool of information
and everyone's isolated and what they
said so we may show b-roll of video
cards during this video if we do it has
no correlation with what I'm saying the
manufacturer is shown and the b-roll may
not have even been spoken to you and the
video editor doesn't know which company
said what anyway so we have even
isolated ourselves from the information
so if there's b-roll it doesn't mean
anything
now I starting out so let's let's look
at the first company we spoke to for
what do you think of
six months later these companies
generally aligned with one another when
we first in this video and that remains
mostly true now only a couple of
defectors so first company we spoke to
said that there is there are a few
factors playing into the current market
one limited supply and we'll talk about
that more in a moment to end of year in
holidays drying up supply anyway and
manufacturers never want to invest a lot
in reviving or continuing a product line
in the face of potential new launches as
happens every year and then there's
another aspect of this where once mining
goes away the miners aren't long-term
customers so this is a big one that we
talked about in the first video a few of
the manufacturers we spoke to then and
the same ones now actually suggested
that miners are not brand loyal there's
two sides to this a crypto minor we'll
go out and find GPUs and buy them and
whatever quantity they can get from
whomever sells it because those cards
only do one thing and the only thing you
really need out of the card is that it's
in stock so this is not a customer that
you have to use customer acquisition
methods on they don't really require
marketing they don't require advertising
they don't require buying incentives
like $20 rebates so that's the positive
side of it from the manufacturers
perspective from those we've spoken to
there's really no customer acquisition
cost the negative side of it is that
these customers mining buyers are also
not brand loyal they don't care who you
are or what you offer outside of a video
card
there's no expansion into a greater
ecosystem and that goes with some of the
other points we talked about in the
first video that are still true today
for the vendors we've spoken with that
sell multiple product lines for example
perhaps they sell motherboards or
monitors peripherals pretty much
everyone sells peripherals at this point
anything gamer targeted alongside their
GPUs the concern is that miners are not
customers also of those components so
you may have a scenario where you've
tipped the scales
of GPU sales going up but all the other
products in the ecosystem aren't really
selling quite as much as they typically
would be in relation to the GPU sales so
the ratio of GPU to other components is
now skewed which is a potential problem
depending on what they're saying and how
much of it they're expecting to sell the
same first company we spoke with is
looking for long-term gaming customers
and it didn't really seem like just
pandering either it seems pretty
legitimate from a business sense in that
with with gaming users who buy a single
or maybe two or three cards and that's
kind of it you're looking at someone who
if they have a good experience with your
company they're very likely to buy from
your company again because they have no
reason not to and if they've used
customer service and it turned out
positive there's more reason to use your
company again selling the GPUs so long
term you're losing that with minors and
if they can't solve the gamers today
that's a problem now another concern
here so we we ask the obvious question
well why don't you just make more cards
and speaking with everyone here this is
data from all of them it sounds like
none of the vendors really think that
they are at least pushing Nvidia to the
maximum GPU supply meaning the vendors
we've spoke to believe that Nvidia could
supply more GPUs if the manufacturers
did request more GPUs
however the manufacturers are the ones
who ultimately get stuck holding a bag
if they can't sell them so this happened
in a couple years ago and one of the
first crypto kind of booms and busts
where manufacturers who bet on crypto
mining either did very well if they got
in early or got burned bad if they got
in a little too late right before a
crash because you have all the the cards
sitting on shelves and warehouses or
coming back to return channels so it's
not as simple as just buying more
because purchases of GPUs with everyone
we spoke spoken to pretty much happen
from a quarterly analysis so you look at
what are your expectations for the
quarter let's buy based on that and then
from there you either bet
on crypto or you don't and you just
stick with what you would typically
order for your volume move then for your
customers and there's no real way to
track minor versus game or purchases for
these board partners so they don't have
a good indication of how many to buy and
they're also generally concerned about
being left with overstock where you've
invested more than you make back here's
where we diverge from mining though I
said that mining was not as big a factor
as we may have been led to believe and
part of that is supply so you may have
noticed that DRAM prices are and you
were from two to four times what they
used to be this plays into GPU prices as
well because the memory that is on GPUs
comes out of the same three fabs pretty
much that supply all of the system
memory chips and all of the NAND for the
most part so you've really only got a
couple of manufacturers there you have
micron you have SK Hynix and you have
Samsung and memory prices for ddr4 have
gone up a lot ddr3 Ghana plot SSDs have
increased in price well GPU is also use
memory they've also increased in price
now some of this is from third-party or
secondary sellers as opposed to primary
markets so when you're looking at prices
online be sure that you differentiate
between the two but from what we
understand and we've confirmed this with
multiple of these vendors GPU memory
prices gddr5 have gone up for an eight
gigabyte card by about twenty to thirty
dollars in recent days this is a much
bigger movement in price and this is
cost this is not what you pay this is
what the manufacturer pays if they mark
that up you pay a whole lot more so and
this is from direct sales as well by the
way this isn't sold by AMD or Nvidia
these are direct contacts to the
suppliers so that's a big price movement
we asked what the typical price movement
would be maybe quarter to quarter it's
more around $5 so to go up to twenty to
thirty is significant and that increases
the bill of materials cost which could
potentially increase what you pay or it
decreases the amount of incentives that
are applied to GPUs
for sale incentives would include
rebates instant discounts free games
stuff like that those if there's high
demand which there is right now and cost
has gone up all of the incentives go
away so that's a lot of what we're
seeing right now rebates are pretty much
non-existent and that's because they
don't need to offer them
so that's something where mining has a
direct impact the supply costs have a
direct impact and gamers get burned for
it and actually miners would technically
be paying a bit more as well because
they lose incentive offers if they even
cared about them
and speaking with the companies we also
learned that well this is kind of
obvious but resale value of cards goes
down with new architectures so there's a
point here where the longer mining holds
up until a new architecture it's kind of
better for the manufacturers because if
mining stops being a thin or stops being
profitable to the point where people are
selling off their extra cards that
secondhand market gets flooded bored
partners can't sell as many devices when
they're being sold secondhand for dirt
cheap and people are buying them there
so there's actually a potential decrease
in revenue or expected revenue as the
second-hand market floods and if the
second-hand market floods assuming
mining at some point takes a dip it
would be better for the manufacturers
the board partners if it's closer or
after the release of a new architecture
because 10 series cards 500 series cards
and Vega cards would be worth less
secondhand than today whereas today
you're cutting closer to whatever the
retail prices as opposed to whatever the
value is after new architecture ships
with new features and speeds one of the
other vendors we spoke to really wanted
to illustrate the difference between
primary and secondary markets so this is
where they were pointing out to us that
a lot of the high prices as in the
prices reported by some rumor mill
websites of around $2,000 we're actually
from third-party sellers on Newegg
marketplace and on amazon's third-party
marketplace as opposed to the first
party sales where the card should be
closer to MSRP just without incentives
so manufacturers don't benefit from
second
sailes we also asked when do you all
expect new shipments of cards when
should people be on the lookout for
actual reasonably priced video cards so
they're ordering more every week we know
that a couple of the manufacturers are
expecting a lot of supply at the time
this video goes live this week and so
you should be on the lookout in the next
couple of days or so one thing that a
couple of folks recommended is actually
going retail instead of online this
makes a bit of sense retail you can go
to the store they might be more
expensive than online but you can't buy
it online doesn't really matter and ask
the folks who work there when's your
next shipment and then show up that day
and get one so it's kind of sad that's
the recommendation but that was the
general recommendation to make sure you
can get a card so there are new
shipments all the time we were also told
that there's no expectation that these
new shipments will impact prices and the
best advice is try and get one
immediately when they show up if you can
there was also again from this other
manufacturer concerned about betting too
much on mining in the event of a
collapse and noted that production
cycles plus shipping time can be several
months and it's all based on quarterly
projections so even if a couple months
ago they saw this coming maybe in
December because in December prices were
reasonable so in December they see this
supply shortage come in of video cards
and say you know we need to order a lot
more there was probably still aren't
import from personal experience we know
now thanks to the mod mat that if you're
shipping by boat to save money and it
does save a lot of money versus air
you're looking at shipping times that
could be upwards of 60 days so and that
counts Kustoms that counts from the
factory to the port whatever needs to
happen on in China with that shipment
and then from the port to the port
that's obviously a long interval as well
and then you have customs and then you
have shipping to the warehouse and then
you have shipping to the customer so it
can take a long time which all goes to
say if manufacturers bought in December
in anticipation of today those cards
aren't here yet unless they're shipping
them which in that case the margin goes
away very fast
and there's not a lot of margin on video
cards either assuming they're sold at
reasonable prices
so no expectation that shipments are
impacting price and production cycles
take a while and shipping takes a while
so it'll be a bit before you see supply
refresh fully our price wouldn't drop
unless orders exceeded demand anyway
even if supplies increased so even if
they're all buying more cards and GPUs
as long as there's a market that's split
between gaming mining AI everything else
because these cards can be used there as
well you're gonna see high prices
another vendor we spoke with thought
that mining was a bit more of an issue
than some of these others who indicated
more an issue on supply from memory
going way up and that vendor suggested
that mine for altcoins is becoming more
of a concern especially for the lower
end cards
I guess meaning non TI non 1080 or 64
class so that same manufacturer had
concerned about other products in the
ecosystem as last time things targeted
at gamers if you're buying one board and
6 plus cards
that's only one board sale you might not
be buying to monitor you're certainly
not buying a hundred forty-four Hertz
monitor you're probably not buying a
gaming keyboard and mouse or any of
those other things so that's a big
concern as well and let's go through the
overall now overall I suppose one of the
bigger questions is what would a company
like Nvidia or AMD you think and one
could assume that for Nvidia AMD just
like all the board vendors the biggest
issue is being unpredictable and
unstable if this were a stable market if
crypto mining proved itself to be a
something that will stay long-term and
its current capacity and its current
demand and this isn't saying that crypto
won't stick around it's saying that we
don't know to what extent mining will
stick around especially for current
cards if there were stability there they
could account for this by increasing how
many cards that buy and how many GPUs
they're buying because then they
wouldn't be worrying about am I to be
left holding a 500 pound bag of video
cards when it all collapses so that's
the biggest possible problem is
instability and unpredictable behavior
in the mark
and in addition to that right now it's
just as much of a gamble for the
manufacturers as it is for the crypto
miners to buy the cards because
manufacturers again don't want to be
left with them when new architectures
are probably around the corner so a
couple things to go over here then
mining isn't necessarily as much to
blame as you think there are other
market factors at play memory cost is a
gigantic one 20 to 30 dollar increase in
Bill of Materials is significant
especially when you're expecting five so
that's a big deal and it sounds like the
GPU makers could probably put out more
GPUs if they were requested it's just
the board partners aren't buying them so
not as simple as saying Nvidia could
make more GPUs or AMD could make GPUs in
greater quantities because yeah they
probably could but someone's got to buy
him they're not just gonna make them and
leave them on the shelves
so that's I've seen some commentary
online
this is Nvidia named these fault for not
making enough product now they have
customers they don't sell the card to
you and Vidya makes reference cards they
saw them in a quantity limit of two Andy
I don't know that they they've they
technically have reference cards they
don't really make them that much anymore
it's up to the board partners now so in
either case you can't make more unless
one buys it how you could but what's the
point so it's not quite that simple so
let's talk about the final point here
which is Nvidia AMD as GPU makers
despite significant reach in deep
learning data center ai automotive and
royalty sales Nvidia still moves the
vast majority of its revenue via gaming
markets it's actually quite significant
it's about 58% of Nvidia's total revenue
is because of gaming GPUs so from Nvidia
is perspective and speaking with people
in the industry the or I should say
assumes perspective anyway the concern
is that investors may see a decline in
enthusiasts PC adoption that is similar
to the decline in consumer desktop PC
adoptions
enthusiasts is the only space where
we've seen growth for desktop computers
any time in the last couple of years and
if suddenly there's a dip because gamers
can't buy cards and RAM to build a
computer that's gonna reflect poorly
investors might get spooked and they
might move their money elsewhere
so from Nvidia's and AMD's perspective
that is a potential concern because
enthusiasts PC adoptions really the only
fortress in a declining desktop market
so that's something to keep in mind
where you know if you see desktop going
down why would you keep investing in
gaming GPUs especially when the
company's revenue is 58% Gaming GP is as
for AMD we know that Andy has publicly
rebranded its now-defunct frontier
Edition card as a blockchain pioneers
card so we know that they they're
definitely making a play there which is
reasonable it is a market after all
sadly frontier editions one of the most
affordable video cards in the face of
$2,000 Vegas 64 is which just comes down
to them being in stock for good reason
but we also know that RTG has invested
considerable resources in gaming markets
the last six months it's been drivers
for gaming regularly the most consistent
drivers AMD has put out in a long time
with all these gaming targeted features
so there's a lot to lose if that's not
being leveraged by gamers all of that
goodwill all of that effort is not
getting really noticed by the audience
that they've invested it for so they
also faced new competition both Nvidia
and AMD groups like TSM see the one of
the major manufacturers of silicon now
service mining companies like Pitt made
so if you've got more competition buying
from your primary supplier for chips
price could play a bit there on the
manufacturing side as well so that all
comes down to whether TSM sees at
maximum capacity or not though but that
should pretty much sum it up so a bunch
of thoughts very few of those were mine
except for kind of talking about stuff
towards the end and some in some
capacity but most of that comes from
manufac
just kind of aggregated and anonymized
for you overall it would seem that a lot
of the opinions are the same as six
months ago when we spoke to them just
now I definitely got the sense speaking
with some representatives that it's like
this is getting a little crazy like this
six months ago we were all so naive that
Cohen went up to what was it two
thousand dollars at the time and that
seemed high and altcoins I've exploded
recently hence why get manufacturers
saying all coin mining is a potential
concern for low-end cards so yeah that
said though it's not just mining either
its memory prices too so there's a lot a
lot of things going on now that are
driving up prices so if you're trying to
buy a GPU for gaming they're coming in
regularly shipments haven't stopped some
manufacturers are betting bigger on
mining than others I'm not gonna talk
about who those are but the point is
keep an eye out every week because stock
refresh is basically every week at this
point and if you have a store near you
just go there
make friends with representative and ask
them when the cards are coming in and
just go buy locally and pay the tax
because it's gonna be easier than
waiting for retailers online as far as
retailers are concerned they probably
don't really care who buys the product
because they're really just mercenaries
in the space they have a unless the sale
of GPUs does not outweigh the sale of
everything else that goes into a
computer that you have no reason to care
either direction so our conclusion here
is pretty much the same as it was six
months ago people like power supply
manufacturers are perfectly happy with
all of this they're selling more high
wattage power supplies than they've ever
sold high wattage PSU sales were down
thanks to the decrease in power needs by
GPUs and CPUs and now they're up because
of mining so they're quite happy with
that as far as the board partners
they're benefiting from immediate gains
immediate sales because of the increased
demand from to markets existing
simultaneously mining and gaming but
they're still concerned about long term
impact and some companies are more
afraid than others to bet hard on crypto
mining which means that they're not
getting in really much more supply than
they normally would
which is what gives us our current
situation that's it for this one
