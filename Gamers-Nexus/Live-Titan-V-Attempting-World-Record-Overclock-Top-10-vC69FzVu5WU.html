for purposes of the archive later this
is going to be a top 10 attempt the
title says world record parentheses top
10 we're not the best overclockers I'm
not using Allen too but we've done a
liquid cooling mod on the Titan V so now
that everyone is up to speed there I'm
gonna wait and make sure in chat let me
know if audio and video are both good
and then we'll proceed but in the
meantime explaining some of the setup
basically we've got a 79 80 XE under a
crackin X 62 cooler so I have room to
improve the cooler there if we end up
needing it it is cooled with it's got a
liquid metal replacement for the Tim so
that helps us a ton actually and then we
have a Titan V with everything everyone
says it's good okay cool we have a Titan
V that is under liquid so this video the
liquid cooled video isn't live yet it
will go live basically immediately when
the stream ends it's the hybrid mod step
by step audio Hertz audio is bad why is
audio bad
sounds like there's different mics
alright as if someone could let me know
why it's bad that would be great audio
is louder on the left channel and
clipping is it OBS on mono yes
Oh es is on mono so it should only be
going through one channel audio is
one-sided can you fix that on just with
you know how to fix that right
okay so Andrews looking at that while
we're looking into that yeah we got it
there you just dial it up to the middle
or something or okay so I'm going to
keep explaining while Andrew works on
that and we are basically going to be
working on overclocking the Titan V to
the highest we can got it under the
liquid hopefully a little bit higher
than we could with air and then we are
also going to be working on overclocking
the 79 80 XE so it seems better now
someone says popping on the right some
times before going back good now good
now good enough okay so I don't know
what you do you just set it back to what
it was originally okay so we were trying
to minimize the fan noise we have a lot
of fans is that bright enough to show it
we'll try and show the task badge it's
kind of dark we have a lot of hands set
up that's kind of a cool shot actually
and basically what I'm doing here is
we've got a be quiet silent loop 280 on
the hybrid card which is a Titan V and
then we have the wii i modded the
testbench so it's got a 120 Maglev fan
from corsair blasting the vrm on the
titan v with air and then we have the
two fans on the crack neck 62 on max so
we're trying to fix that so that you're
not just hearing white noise from fans
the whole time but if you hear the fan
noise I'm sorry there's nothing I can do
you know where we need to cool these
things because they're going to get hot
really hot in the 79 80 X YZ case so
yeah I think that is a I think that's
enough to get us all set looks like most
people are saying that the audio is okay
now someone says it's slightly out of
sync but I don't know there's not a lot
we can do about that
that's true because the audio is going
straight into the camera the camera
feeds going straight into the computer
so they should be synchronized if not
it's it's somewhere between our internet
connection and YouTube okay so let me
know if anything goes horribly wrong and
I will fix it answering some immediate
questions we have not done a shunt mod
yet I don't know if we will today that
might be something I do in a second
stream but I don't know how much we'll
need it we are going for top 10 for the
fire strike scores let me switch over to
the
you
but for our scoring system with remarked
audio cut no audio audio ded what
happened you can hear it why is the
audio gone
I'm not muted let's go I'll increase the
decrease of sensitivity I guess just in
case
check check you can still hear it right
yeah okay let's see what's gonna what am
I getting spammed on no sound on this
scene oh is that what they're saying
hello there's no sound on the scene Oh
weird wait is it really back is that all
it was okay no there was the well I
guess it could have been the sensitivity
or the scene I don't know okay all right
thanks guys for helping me out with this
so if it died right when I change scenes
then then that that makes it easier
should I change the sensitivity again as
set as a negative 21 turn it down
they're saying I think we're on negative
30 okay all right
okay so I'll figure it out
yeah so let's let's get started here I
am going to do just a simple test so we
are running the 79-80 x ii stock and the
Titan V stock except with the liquid
cooler which will help stabilize the
clocks of it and the only change that is
in there is XMP so we've got XMP and
that's it so this will establish our
baseline it's not going to be a high
scoring result but it will let us know
where we start and then we can work up
from there and I think I I think I have
an idea for how to fix that audio issue
when I change scenes later
we're not streamers you know we produce
the video and upload it but we'll do our
best so okay let's start it with with
just doing the initial fire strike test
and see where we land
getting a quick look at I'm gonna try
changing stuff here okay let me know if
you can still hear me getting a quick
look at the scoring's now we have at the
top kingpin with a single card and it's
a 1080 TI even not a not even a Titan V
and then we have a couple of other folks
up here with recognizable names you got
extreme addict there Bauer so these
points they're 37,000 this is the total
score not the graphic score and we're
going for roughly 31,000 for our
starting point okay so as long as the
camera feeds go and read it so we're
going for roughly 31,000 let's see where
we start with just a a non overclocked
baseline and and have a look at that so
benchmarks all we're gonna do is run
fire strike we might do times by later -
we don't need the demo and let's let
that go that'll take a minute to run and
hopefully no artifacts or anything
because it's just stock right now so
hopefully we're good with that okay
all right so everyone says it seems to
say audio is at least working now all
right so yeah this will I think we're
set - what does this go up to like three
point four gigahertz or three point six
when it's stock and boosted I think and
we have the GPU just under complete auto
settings if anyone recalls our power
meter we have that set up over here in
the corner so the power meter is going
to give us a live feed of how much power
the system is consuming and this will
yeah there you go
so we're currently at 430 watts I have a
power budget of about 1200 on this setup
and that should be plenty for what we're
doing today because we're not doing dual
GPU although I could we have that other
Titan view from bits B trip and actually
so yeah we're at 430 ish watts right now
the other stats on the screen don't
really tell us much other than voltage
coming from the wall which this is the
u.s. so that's all expected and and we
can actually look at how many watt hours
we're using - which is just kind of a
fun stat are you going that liquid or
L&amp;amp;T or just overclocking on stock cooler
we are using a be quiet silent loop 280
for the Titan V we modded that the other
day that video will go live when this
video the stream ends and then we also
have the the 79 80 X II under a crack
neck 62 which is just out of frame it's
coming into frame it looks like it's a
crack connect 62 basically to 280
millimeter coolers mounted to the bench
we could do a bit better but that's
gonna get us started the other 120 fan
there is a yes we are using the EVGA X
299 dark motherboard so that board
actually has been really helpful because
it has those built-in fans on the VR I'm
the cooler and a real heatsink and that
means that we don't have to really worry
about the vrm overheating which was a
major concern when overclocked in the 79
80 XE so that's pretty much taking care
of itself on top of the card at the
Titan v I've got a be quiet fan that I
pulled off the silent loop and all
that's doing is blasting air onto the
right side of the V RM half of the VR M
is on the right of the GPU then the left
side of the V arm is being cooled by the
Corsair fan and we have to 140 Maglev
Corsair fans on the be quiet loop
they're doing a lot better than the
stock fans for that because we don't
care about noise we care about
performance here and it's low FPS
because that we are establishing a
baseline right now so there's no
overclock at all we have not overclocked
the GPU we have not overclocked the CPU
so we'll we'll get there but we're just
trying to see what kind of points we get
baseline
if you feel okay
that's pretty happy there now it's up to
you if you can do it without the HDMI
coming unplugged okay Andrew is
attempting something very dangerous
watch your audio Lisa I'm clipping the
camera from the rails and I gotta try
and walk Oh or to do a live feed you're
still stuck yeah there you go so
hopefully we don't lose the camera okay
so it's it's gonna take a second
stabilized he's got to move a forest of
tripods out of the way and he's got a
large light mountain to the top of the
camera that's not bad
okay so be quiet fan over there blowing
onto the right half of erm corsair fan
there on the left half and zxe cooler on
the 79-80 XE we are currently using G
scale Triton Z memory and that is set to
XMP right now I have a Corsair forty six
hundred megahertz kid of memory that we
will put in there later and that's going
to help us out a lot but for now we are
using the what the G scale Trident II
black kit so all right let's let's see
what we got so this is our baseline if
everyone can kind of remember this where
our baseline is 26,000 points and re
mounting the camera to the tripod 26,000
points our graphic score 32,000 so the
first thing we're gonna do is establish
a basic overclock I'm gonna get a no
signal error here because we're
restarting into BIOS so bear with me
while we get that no signal error and we
are booting into BIOS to set a baseline
overclock that I know should be stable
and then we'll go up from there into
uncharted territory for us so this is
going to be starting at probably 44 or
45 X for the multiplier I'm thinking we
can get up to about forty eight or nine
stable but I know that 45 will work
starting out so let's go
well yeah let's let's try 45 and see how
that goes we might just need a little
bit higher voltage than that I'm I've
been doing leave mesh ratio Auto for
right now I'm going to change a lot of
these settings later as we continue to
iterate on the scores vcore I'm going to
set - we were stable 4.4 gigahertz at
1.18
so I'm thinking me one point two four
four point five not 13 that would be bad
one point two four four point five and
then we'll go up from there later si and
IO we don't need to change yet we'll do
that once we get to the Corsair memory
that's a higher frequency and yes it is
a delayed CPU that's a good good point
it's D later which is helping a ton by
the way
dropping like 20 degrees so we have
conduct a knot on the CPU and then we
have cryo na I think on the GPU I didn't
want to use a liquid metal on the GPU
just yet okay so let's turn off any of
the power saving or the sea states just
get a baseline with this stuff and
memories got X and P on we'll tune that
later so all we're really doing is
voltage and multiplier for starting and
then we'll get into the rest and a bid
oh hey there Bauer just joined hello
there Bauer welcome enjoy critiquing so
to get everyone up to speed we're just
setting a really basic set up that I
know is stable I'm gonna go tune mesh
ratio and a couple of other things in a
bit I think we can do top 10 today let's
start there yes the GPU is underwater
let's start there and see how that goes
what's a what stare Bauer's rank right
now yeah for I think he's fourth or
something
why is this freaking out
where's the reset button all right you
said that I might have you hit the reset
button sometimes yeah
so there is a let me find that CMOS
clear excuse me all right
got all the power it's do a safe boot so
you've never if you haven't had a board
with the retry and the safe boot buttons
on them those are amazing
we're just doing a safe boot with the
red button which will get us up to we
are not going to be top five
so we are gonna see if I just need to
increase that voltage for now I think we
had a couple of super chats come in do
you get a better cut from super chat
than patreon that's a good question
so patreon charges
what are they give us they give us like
think they give us I think they take 5%
and that's all public I'm pretty sure
they take 5% so why did I knock it out
or something oh
he pulled the light out I hope gotcha
so I think patreon takes 5% and then
YouTube takes like 35% which is insane
so yeah YouTube takes definitely more
money from super chat they take 45% of
bad revenue just from the Adsense stuff
that plays which I guess that's fair we
upload a lot of content it's large it
costs money to store all of that so it's
it's kind of hard to argue with it but
patreon is pretty good to us they they
do
let's just go to 1.2 for I know we don't
we have no signal right now I'll get in
a second yeah if you could let's just do
that way for a second
so yeah despite the patreon stops there
changes I don't know if all of you saw
that which is great news but they will
probably roll something out in the
future
I just I hope they charge us instead of
you all that would be my my ideal
situation because then yeah I'd much
rather pay for that difference the
transaction fees then half our
supporters pay for it okay let's see how
this goes
yeah page around 5% they were going to
start charging people 2.9 percent I
believe for the credit card transaction
fee and then they were gonna charge what
was it
35 cents on each transaction so they've
rolled that back yeah I believe YouTube
is 35 percent of super chat another one
so sir Romeo J says love your content
just bought a silverstone PM a one case
on your recommendation that is a great
case we use that for our rendering
machine yeah I like the PMO one we
actually never reviewed it unfortunately
because we ended up putting it to use
straight away on the there we go now we
got feed again put it to you straight
away on the render machine see how it's
a good case ok so all I've done for now
is established 44 and we're at 1.2 for
because I know it'll be stea we'll go up
from there
I slowed down the memory a bit let's
just get this thing working I think I
have to set the boot drive too and then
we're going to keyboard LEDs they're
going crazy because the refresh or the
shutter on the camera versus the LED
refresh
okay so we just need to set the boot
drive and that's gonna be this drive
okay so now we can boot again what do
you think of the Cougar Panzer case I
actually requested that case and we
ended up getting in the Cougar conquer
first so the conquer is that crazy three
hundred plus dollar case that's kind of
a looks like the in win style with all
aluminum and glass and stuff like that
and we got one of those in we were
looking at the Panzer but I think we
might wait till CES because a lot of
stuff tends to launch at CES so I think
the Panzers from like 2016 at this point
so they have a new case we'll we'll wait
till then to get it it does look like it
actually has ventilation out of those so
that's good well you have a video about
the water cooling mod yes we will we
actually already shot it and it's ready
to go I'm going to set it live as soon
as we're done with the stream today so
let's do a couple checks here just cam
come on no not nothing not now okay
hahaha let's do a couple checks on the
health of the GPU to make sure the mods
working okay we're gonna do we've got a
four point four on the CPU right now
increase that later and then we have I
know where we were stable I think at two
hundred two hundred I might have to back
off a bit but we'll see it's gonna take
a second it's applying the HBM overclock
so the Titan V I guess you all probably
aren't familiar with this yet the Titan
V does behave a bit oddly when you start
applying memory over clocks like
breaking the display on occasion it
normally comes back though I think it's
confused because it's trying to go to
the other monitor actually but I might
have to unplug that HDMI or something
it's um yeah let's hit a reset on that
and I might have to unplug the feed from
the computer so it doesn't try and
output to the wrong display we'll try
that one more time first so we're
applying an h BM to overclock offset and
a core overclock offset and that will
get us to where we were
for the review plus 200 plus 200 if it
will apply properly and then supposed to
be having their to do we actually
nothing to do with fan speed anymore
that's all done with liquid now and
nothing to do with the with the cooling
at this point because we've got
everything on the on the direct air path
coin from the fans so it's still trying
to output the ROM display I think that's
I'm gonna unplug the stream version of
this for a second and we'll just film it
if we have to
okay one two three there we go and on
so I don't plug the HDMI I was trying to
spit everything out I know we haven't
done the shunt mod yet I don't know if
we will like if we do it'll be a
separate video I think is the plan
so they can outfit this time it's
looking better already
yeah a separate video if we do okay
monitors coming back good
so that's annoying I think when the
video card over clocks are applied or
maybe when it fails we're gonna have
trouble with the display going out to to
this monitor that I'm working on and to
the stream so what we're gonna do for
now is just film the monitor whenever we
want to show it because it's it's adding
variables that don't need to exist so
yeah we'll just go with this this old
method for now so benchmarks and I'm
gonna apply let's try this one more time
let's goes at 200 150 apply
150 precision actually does work with
this which I wasn't really expecting to
be honest but I guess it is similar
architecture okay let's see if it
actually works and let's get some GPU
stats up here while it's going the HBM
should be cooled pretty well it's under
a flat plate that'd be quiet silent loop
and I'm hoping that's enough to keep the
HBM cool we also have I guess I need to
move some of this stuff over for the
camera so here's our clock setup right
now this this should be able to go up to
200 but let me let it load first and I
might start playing around with it
okay so let's that applied there we go
so you see like it freezes when you
apply those memory over clocks on this
card sometimes the screen will flicker
black but it tends to come back
afterwards so we're at 1026 right now I
haven't it apply on this is 175 we're
doing 2017 so two gigahertz on the core
now previously if you saw our Titan V
content this number in the benchmarks
and everything tended to be closer to
1800 let's kind of be fair to it and say
like 1880 at kind of a high end it would
hit 1950 in extreme cases but that was
the peak value that was not the ongoing
value so the problem was it would
thermal throttle the card hits we're at
31 degrees right now
room ambient is probably 20 or so the
card when it hits 82 to 84 84 it hits a
really hard thermal wall and starts
dropping clocks big time 82 it'll
throttle back a little bit once you're
over 60 it's it's not really throttling
it's just not boosting as high
so stay under 60 is gonna be really good
for us so right 20 40 megahertz now I am
almost positive I can't get this number
any higher than it already is without
without extreme cooling but we can get
the memory number higher we're at 1026
megahertz on HP m2 right now
gpo temperatures gonna be about the same
well not about the same but if the GPU
is cool the HBM will be cool
so we're 41c on the GPU let's try and
apply this and see if it'll do it
without crashing I think it might might
be unhappy with that clock right now
which is unfortunate so we've got a 200
offset on the core and what were we at
1:00 so d5 on the memory so I might have
to stick with that restart this again
hopefully that restarts now we have a
lot more room to go on the CPU though so
that's good you have a ton of room on
the CPU and on the memory because we
have better memory to work with just a
snowflake err on everything so while we
wait for that to come back I guess I'll
keep it to 175 for right now while we
wait for that does it have a lot of
coralline I don't think it's yeah
actually yeah the Titan P does have some
coil whine actually ours does anyway
yeah we could do two dual Titan V's
unfortunately so we have a video coming
up on this - we've already done some
testing with two of these things with
explicit multi-gpu will support it
unfortunately I need to power this again
unfortunately there's basically one game
with that that that will support it and
that's ashes so we've done that testing
that'll be up soon but what else I tried
to total war in DirectX 12
I tried hitman I tried deus ex and none
of those would recognize to Titan B's
even civ 5 which supports explicit
multi-gpu none of those things recognize
the two cards unfortunately ashes does
however so we will actually have some
ashes numbers for you with two Titan V's
GPU PI will support two so that's good
fire strike does not and times pi does
not because this so a lot of you are
asking this in our Titan V coverage okay
we're booting that's good
this connector up here is env link so
it's not SLI the I was looking into it
the env link bridge is $600 so that
anyone has one they want to loan us
I can I can try and bridge them and see
if it even works I don't I've heard
rumors that it doesn't even work but
we've got two cards temporarily the
second one that's still air-cooled is
from bits B trip and we won't be modding
that but I think I'll double-check with
them I think they gave me permission to
open it up though just so we can kind of
do a check to see if its assembly is any
different from ours which it shouldn't
be that's the whole point of checking
all right so let's get one of these to
complete let's go 200 200 and 175 at
120% okay there we go
in 75 apply okay it has applied
correctly this time and then let's just
do run in windowed mode get GPZ open and
I'm not going to touch at this time we
will let it finish and see where we move
to so I think our score originally our
baseline no overclocked score is 26,000
so let's see what a 4.4 gigahertz CPU
and 200 offset will do on this and then
we'll start looking at the switching
memory and I think we'll probably focus
on the CPU overclock for now I don't
read questions while this begins to run
yeah SLI does definitely have headaches
bits be tripping is a great name I agree
let's see
yes $600 for envy link why aren't you up
in the voltage it doesn't really do
anything that's just a feel good slider
yeah I mean we could drag it up but it
doesn't really actually change anything
things gonna stop at 1.09 3 volts no
matter what doesn't matter what I tell
it to do I don't think we actually have
a software voltage readout either I was
measuring it with a multimeter earlier
unfortunately I think
set up like not gonna be able to do that
and show you the numbers because it's
got the card against the wall but builds
oh I did a video for us that's coming
out soon and that is PCB and vrm
analysis of the Titan V and I gave him a
bunch of voltage numbers for that so
he'll be talking you through all of
those numbers in the current numbers and
he also mentions how the voltage slider
doesn't really do much in there I think
if I remember correctly
let's see any other questions yet yes
who builds woods content I'm thinking
probably will go for power target is as
high as it goes probably for build Zoid
and his vrm analysis will target Sunday
or Monday for publication of that today
after the stream we're publishing our
hybrid mod for the Titan V went way
better than expected and and then we've
got some other content coming up soon
that's not Titan related if you're sick
of that already then as far as let's see
oh yeah power target it's a power dark
it stops at 120 on this card the cards
fairly power-hungry it's a quote builds
or this is kind of a return to form for
NVIDIA where they are Hara they're
starting to pull a lot of power now to
be fair to them Volta is not the
next-gen gaming architecture and the the
the Volta configuration we have is
targeted at things like machine learning
deep learning and those don't really
have the same requirements as gaming
gaming is not going to utilize the
tensor cores or anything like that
and that means tilt the screen to the
camera a bit
so the tensor core that any better not
gonna fall off the table more yeah okay
yeah tensor course will be removed
probably for gaming I actually don't
know I'm just kind of making an educated
guess and if they are I would assume
that the efficiency would improve a bit
because right now the dye is huge and
it's got a bunch of stuff that games and
firestrike don't use okay so we've
increased this a little bit we've
increased this actually a lot what we
need to do now is how is our clock in
this core clock there you go that's what
you want to see so is this visible this
core clock thing so it's kind of hard to
see like if anyone's just joining we
can't screencap this we're having issues
with it not knowing which display to do
when it crashed so this is pretty steady
above 2 gigahertz like all the time
they're like 20 40 at best cases and
it's not clock dropping anymore so we've
resolved the thermal issue the power
issue can be kind of worked with by
doing a short on the shunts but I don't
know if we're going to do that okay so
we've got a decent starting point and it
seems like this is on a halfie once I
get a 200 megahertz right now I'm not
sure why but we'll leave it at 175 for
the HBM and I need to I need to get
working on the CPU at this point so let
me see what I have some notes on this
for what we want to do for the CPU
I always go so I have a new by us by the
way on missed it almost hitting delete
and everything on the X 299 dark so they
sent me a new bios that solves some of
the memory overclocking potential limits
and I think it's gonna get us in a place
where we're good enough to use it today
probably gonna get a dual channel leader
because the coarser kid I have is only
two sticks I'm not sure how much fire
strike care is about dual or quad okay
so we're gonna go we've got four point
five gigahertz up next I think we can do
up to four point eight I think we're
gonna have trouble once we start going
to four point nine on the CPU any
questions while I'm working on this yeah
will screenshot it okay yes double
precision is also useless for gaming
okay I was looking at chat so I'm still
hitting delete let's go let's do let's
do 46 and see if it stays stable I'm
gonna stay at one point two four I think
four five and let's go to what else can
we do here one of those beef core is
already set
I'll start setting these once we do more
with the memory uncor offset start there
okay I think that's a good start
memories just still XMP that everything
I want think so yeah that's all I want
right now okay
does it run Crysis it does would you
believe that $3,000 for the iCard runs
the game from 2009 or whatever it was I
think crisis was out when the 8800 GT or
the gtx 8800 and the 8800 ultra were big
that's that was the card I had at that
time okay so we are gone four point six
still on g.skill memory 34 the match
ratio for now gonna push 32 later if I
can see states are off and I think
that'll improve our score a bit so if
you're just joining our baseline score
no overclock was I think 26,000 or
something like that yeah
so brainy want everyone up to speed CPU
is deleted we have conducted out on
there I mention it because I believe the
conduct anat application on this right
now is what's making it possible to run
the the voltages were running on just a
two hundred eighty millimeter cooler
because we were getting pretty high
originally with the stock Tim and it was
not going to work on this cooler so we
are delighted we have liquid metal on
there
we have cryo not which i think is a 12.5
watt per meter Kelvin compound and
cryo knot should also be more than a
week through liquid metal on it but it
just doesn't need it okay see what it
does
any questions why all this is starting
to go kind of reading chat right now 65c
is too hot are you gonna wear to go over
that in a bit uh I don't have a line
dear
what was the second score we didn't get
a total number for that because I ran it
I ran a custom test to just keep an eye
on GPZ and make sure that the tour
wasn't overheating because we had those
black screen issues and I wasn't
positive at the time if they're from
splitting the output or if they were
from the the liquid cooler we have on
there not cooling it properly
but it appears that it was actually just
the splitter output so that's good so we
didn't have a second score because I was
making sure the card was alive we are
running fire strike 1080p right now the
normal one do you think the target for
Volta main stream cards will be
performance and power over current gen
cards or just performance I think it
will be renamed I don't know how much a
Volta will find its way into whatever
comes out next I would have to imagine a
good bit of it because developing two
different architectures in tandem sounds
prohibitively expensive especially with
Nvidia how much they brag about spending
billions on this stuff so I would
imagine a lot of Volta will move forward
but yeah I'm thinking I'm thinking
efficiency is not going to be as big as
it was for Pascal that's kind of my
guess right now what processor are you
using we're using the i9 79 80 X II
and Volta is pointless for gaming I
would somewhat agree with that you
probably shouldn't buy it for gaming
that's for sure do you think I am the
Pauline Vega reference models from the
market was a good move for their AI V
partners was that actually confirmed I
know that was a rumor if it's confirmed
I mean assuming that's still being made
by the partners and sold by them
whatever I guess it should benefit the
partners assuming they actually make the
thins maybe that'll give them reason to
put out some more partner models you
recommend opening up a 1080 TI to put
liquid metal on it like yeah it would
make a difference but the thing with
these is GPUs unlike CPUs don't have an
IHS they're already pretty much direct
contact to the cooler so you can improve
it but I don't really think it's worth
it to be honest it's it's a little bit
more risk you would want to put some
nail polish or some electrical tape or
something around any of the capacitors
and sim DS and SMD components and
resistors to protect them from a liquid
metal of it spills ok 3909 what are we
at
what's the scoreboard I forget how about
fire strike
so thirty thousand we haven't really
this this isn't even my final form so
rat you get a bit of an unfair advantage
actually having all the hardware is that
where are we
thirty thousand 909 for the total score
I mean the right thing yes thirty
thousand 909 would be right here so we
are currently number eleven without
having submitted the score or anything
so I think we're at 11 right now I want
top 10 we presently have let's let's
take a look at where we're behind is
probably the CPU almost definitely so
number 10 is Dan cop
I believe I met Dan cop at Computex I'm
not sure though
so what's he got for score so Dan cop is
he's got thirty three thousand five
eighty four physics is this the right
image 31 okay we're actually not too far
from this so thirty seven thousand seven
sixty three on the graphics we're at
37,000 so we could we need to improve a
bit there or we need to make up for it
in physics which combines four twelve
eight six eight versus 12 six one two so
he's ahead of us primarily in that
graphic score and I wish I could get
this HBM up to 200 I don't know why it's
not cooperating but I'm just you know
let's
I'm gonna try it I'm sorry if this is
kind of like testing patience but I
really want it to work looks like it
worked
alright ten thirty nine let's see if
that improves anything for us
so we were in what was that 11th I think
let's see if this is actually stable it
was kind of having issues earlier so we
currently have a 200 megahertz offset on
the HP M 200 Hertz offset on the core
let's see we have a super chat from nori
who says $5.00 Thank You nori I
appreciate it
nori says can you show us snowflake
unfortunately snowflake is is exiled
from this room turning this process
snowflake has a tendency of jumping on
test benches she really likes them for
those who are not aware snowflake is a
cat not a human she jumps onto has
benches and they're normally off so this
thing right now I mean if you like you
could imagine why a cat being on this
would be all kinds of bad so
unfortunately I can't show her cuz I'm
afraid of what would happen to the cards
she probably won't like the fans too
much either
alright what kind of power are we
drawing actually do you think that deep
learning bench marks will become more
mainstream for GPUs I think that deep
learning bench marks will definitely
find their way into more reviews if only
because we're looking at things that are
getting better at it and it's a huge
growing industry deep learning if if I
had the capacity to expand into another
area of technology that would probably
be it right now
but we're kind of at capacity already so
I think it'll start making its way out I
just I'm not the person to talk to about
that stuff what's our power draw so we
are at 500 and something Watts depending
on when you look at it it's not unplug
it in the process I'm just gonna hold it
for a second let me know and you can see
it so I think I'm looking at a delayed
stream right now so I'm gonna read off
the late numbers think about 515 watts
or something 508 489
yeah okay it's gonna stay all right cool
so we actually still have power capacity
I am only on what is it 1250 I think
about of 1250 watt power supply is an
old NZXT Heil 90 V 2 we have a better
one we have the EVGA supernova T -
that's an amazing power supply but I've
been using this one for benchmarking
lately and I was already on the bench
and I don't think we're gonna exceed its
capacity so I think we're good
yes it would probably help to use a
better one but I am more limited by my
skill and ability at this point than by
power and the power supply so once once
we run into once we surpass knowledge
and ability bottlenecks maybe I'll
consider component changes what CPU is
he using 79 80 XE currently have 4 point
4 gigahertz I think or 4.0 4.6 we have
up to 4.6 we have a bit more room to go
what is the frequency 4.6 the voltage I
just set to a blanket to one point 2 4 5
4 4 your voltage right now are the V RMS
throttling your CPU no fortunately they
are not throttling the CPU and someone
just said audio is out but I haven't
seen anyone I'll say that let me know if
that's actually true so are we a bit
behind where we were a second ago I
think we might be we were at thirty
thousand nine hundred and so we're a
little bit behind let's let's start
messing around with the CPU some more I
might need to switch memory soon
are using two separate power cables yeah
I mean it's a hype hype mata jacquard we
shouldn't need he technically wouldn't
need to but didn't the i9 eat almost as
much as that when you test today yeah so
the reason the cpu the power draw isn't
exceeding what the CPU is that alone
when we reviewed it is because the CB is
not being strained in the same way right
now a lot of the I think when we were
looking at it probably most it was
during a graphics test which means we're
mostly on the the GPU for power
consumption so yeah that's it depends a
lot on what you're doing things like AVX
workloads
will pull a lot more I think we need to
switch the memory here ABX we're close
we'll definitely push a lot more power
when you're pushing a 100% load and
you'll get up to 500 watts let's let's
switch the memory I am going to switch
over to a Corsair kit I'm pretty sure we
can talk about this kit yeah it's this
kits public at this point we have some
separate content we've been working on
for a while and I need grounding strap
okay that should be good so yeah we've
been working on this 4600 kit I'm not
gonna go to 4600 my goal is to go to
4,000 megahertz and then just use
tighter timings I think that's gonna
matter more for this application it has
4600 I think is CL 19 or 18 or something
like that and this bench setups a little
bit awkward for me to access so the
reason we set it up this way is cause I
I don't feel like sweating while we
stream and if you notice all the fans
are facing that way out of the room so
that should make my life a lot more
comfortable while we're streaming even
if it means that it's a bit more of a
pain they get the memory in there right
now
okay so this memory what is the latency
yeah 4600 CL 19 I think we do
closest slot on that side is that they
can't really see that okay
close the slot and far the slot for the
x29 dark with two sticks okay and this
motherboard is only has 4 memory slots
the reason for that is it should help
EVGA out a bit with regard to clock
stability and things like that for
overclocking I think they care a little
bit less on this monitor about the
capacity as they do about making sure
that clocks are good EVGA has had some
problems with memory clocking in the
past as far as I've seen so far they've
gotten a lot better with this with this
motherboard so that's good but yeah
we're gonna still play a little safer so
this kits rated for 4600 it's a huge
pain to get it anywhere close to that
we've done 4500 on some things with an
8700 K but it depends a lot more on your
your memory controller been at that
point and it does yeah
than it does on the the the memory
itself
there we go one command rate one I'm
gonna leave all these time in stock
right now we'll pull them down in a bit
and we're gonna stay at 46 cuz it seems
stable so she don't really change one
thing at a time
we might need to start changing VSA on
VC CIO I'm gonna leave them up Auto
right now well you know we could
increase these a bit I guess let's do
one point three five and one point three
not sure that's gonna be enough it
should be okay though so let's try that
see if it boots alright so back to chat
while this is going
is what a paid ad I don't know audio so
we have people saying like audios fine
and we have people saying audios out
it's hard to know who to believe but
you're all awful people if you're trying
to cause us problems okay so we got a
couple super chats c-code says thank you
for your content
gamers access rules the end of the depth
you guys go to is not incomparable with
other channels thank you for the support
and for the kind words I'm trying to get
better there's a lot we can learn you
have people like we're switching out
batteries on the light right now you
have people like Bill Toit and their
power and all of those folks who are
amazing at what they do so I'm trying to
learn as much as I can from them to try
and bring some of that knowledge sort of
like semi mainstream I guess okay now
chat chat is currently like flooded off
the screen with audio is fine I think
we're good sick mug thank you the new
gamers Nexus mug I didn't actually drink
there's not much in there that's like a
talk show now here's Nexus mug on the
store and we've got the mod mat
underneath it so yeah pretty happy with
the mod mats on store dock gamers Nexus
dotnet slash mod mat and it's up for
pre-order it'll ship in late January or
something and somewhere around them we
just started production okay so what did
we do exactly we switched the memory you
need to make sure that's all detected
before we do anything else
ok so 7 9 8 exe is obviously detecting
we're at 4.6 the voltage get reset maybe
the voltage might have gotten reset when
I rebooted DRAM so we're at 4000
megahertz we are detecting dual channel
and we're some pretty pretty loose
timings right now that's okay let's just
see how it does and then I'll tighten
those up next we need to get that
overclock back on here any minute now
now look at that disparity between one
and is that is that an order one and two
that's crazy
200
come on Titan
I think that'll apply okay cool
so let's just run this and see what it
does with this lose your timings right
now if you re are you using an opt-in no
we are not using opt-in I think audio
audio keep saying you've seen the word
audio it's getting into my speech I
think octane is very interesting and an
important technology I think it's
initial rollout was tragic and it's it's
unfortunate that Intel rolled it out to
a an audience that was basically the
equivalent of kind of you know like your
your grandma or grandpa go to Best Buy
and ask for a computer that's kind of
the audience they were targeting with
opt and it makes some sense it's cheaper
than an SSD I guess but it's basically a
cache drive so there's nothing wrong
with targeting that market but it's kind
of like why didn't Intel fly out all
these high tech media for that but it
didn't really fit the audience but
future octane iterations and obtain dims
I think are very interesting I don't
know enough about them unfortunately
let's see how many cars have you blown
up zero pretty sure I think thank zero
yeah what have I blown up I we've dealt
we've killed memory mostly from ESD
because you handle that stuff a lot and
walking around between rooms on carpet
things like that you can shock it so
I've killed maybe four sticks of memory
in the last couple of years last three
or four years which right now would be
like multiplied the investment because
of the insane price of memory that's an
unfortunate investment loss
let's see psycho dim I gave another
couple bucks and said it's red psycho or
not not sicko sorry I apologize
haha thank you for the informative
videos how do you like the corsair
maglev fans we are actually is that wind
tunnel like gonna be visible do we have
anything over there we can't show hang
on say no we can show everything over
there so we're gonna we're gonna try and
rotate watcher hdmi cable
is that is that visible it's really dark
over because we weren't planning on
filming that area that is a wind tunnel
we're working on doing some tests some
benches with you can bring back over
here I guess so I'll have more on that
soon but uh yeah the maglev azar there's
a reason they're on the bench right now
because they spend really fast and they
pushed a lot of air and I wanted that
more than anything so yeah they're doing
quite well for that for that job now
technically Corsair has another well so
they have I guess there's I think
they're supplier is Sonnen I'm not
positive but either way Sun and makes su
and oh and you can get them on digi-key
they make maglev fans without the LEDs
they spend like three thousand rpm it's
the worst noise you've ever heard in
your life
they're really fast they move a lot of
air and those are hey I think that's
higher is that higher I think those are
like I pay like $13 four hours but we
have the actual the real maglevs up here
right now okay so where are we we're at
thirty one thousand four thirty three I
think we're at thirty thousand 909 or
something before
and so let me drag this over here so
where are we right now
I am move one more time 31 433 3100 one
soar above that what does that say 31
164 wait are we above that already
that's not right is it
no 32 okay 32 it's 31 164 are we at 9th
I think we might be 1/9 right now that
doesn't seem right well okay if we are
then cool so we're still competing
against Titan X's right now the Titan V
is start appearing up here in 7th place
from JPM boy and if we are in so 31 4 3
3 I think we just passed 31 1 64 so 31 -
9 0 Oh 8 so what's this then 32 64 1
what's the difference in score here
32 641 is getting 36,000 yeah number 8
cool yeah oh that's kind of sweet so 32
641 is getting a 36,000 on the graphics
where are we there so we are at 36,000
959 for graphics this user whom I
believe is using a how is this throne is
it a Titan V we're competing against now
we are competing against a Titan V now
so this user is at 36 4 to 4 we're at
9:59 so we're bit ahead of graphics
physics 35 4 9 3 verses 34 4 5 3 so we
need to catch up a bit in physics
where's the combined score difference Oh
17 1 8 6
well we're quite behind there vs. 13 9 5
4 so I think we need to do some CPU
tuning to get this up we have a thousand
points to make up I don't know that we
will what is JPM boy out for clocks 4.9
gigahertz with chilled liquid so we
might not be able to realistically get
that what about this 2000 megahertz so 4
gigahertz on the memory with CL 16 I
think we can kind of do that let's um
let's work on that
yeah well validate in a bit I don't need
to do it right now we I mean I can
always upload later yeah yeah yeah so
someone says wow if I had an i-9 I would
be up there that's the thing right like
I was talking to builds worried about
this where he was builds right if you
don't know he's a very competitive
overclocker and he's also he's not
really
I think it's sponsored by it all right
now but the point is build Zoid has to
buy most of the stuff that he over
clocks and if he doesn't have to buy it
then it's often on loan from his sponsor
so when i was talking to him about was
you know we're at a point now where type
V is not a gaming card but it can be
used for this and obviously score pretty
well get someone like me who's not
at pro overclock or anything up to the
top 10 so what does that tell you right
there's only so much skill involved
there so we were talking about how now
it looks like harbor bots kind of needs
divisions or something if they don't
already have them because you have
people who can grab one of these and a
three nine eight exe and you're already
pretty close to top ten especially if
you can do you change the multiplier and
the voltage and let it go um so yeah
it's it's kind of weird right now for
Hardware bots I think I don't know
hardware bought very well I am not
really an I don't associate as an
overclocker in that scene but I would
think they should have some kind of
division if they don't already so maybe
it'd be cool to do like a sub some two
thousand dollar machines or whatever I
don't know how you really deal with that
but you get the idea
okay so we're stable-ish I technically
have a profile I think we could load but
like a numpad would be great let's do
let's try this let's try something like
that I don't know if there's really what
I want but okay so we've got memory
tunings a bit down from CL 19 still at
one point two four five let's do one
thing at a time
go with the memory we'll go for the core
o'clock in a moment
WTF steve has to tighten visas in cats
yes so I did not buy two that would be
literally insane I don't have that much
money we bought the first one and this
one is on loan from VIPs be trippin I
believe they are entirely focused to
mining and mining benchmarks they
reached out to me and offered to loan it
after they were done doing their
benchmark so you're not familiar with
them and you're curious about mining
performance you can look up bits be
tripping I think we're gonna do our own
test on that too but they are they are
way more specialized in mining so yeah
it's on loan and we'll be working on
that some more let's see yes y'all 17
what else is in here
would Matt seen around with the Nvidia
drivers push it a bit more so there's
only so much you're allowed to do and I
don't know the rules well enough for
hardware bot I think you can change
tessellation but I'm not gonna I don't
know the rules really so I'm not gonna
mess around with the drivers but I do
think they permit some level of software
tuning I just don't know how much
okay so what's our we're testing for a
more stable CLS more stable latency on
the memory 4.6 gigahertz still 1617
16384 now kind of see how that does and
then go from there any day now I need to
just save this profile I guess ok let's
save this here we should be able to do
225 I think so 200 is what we were at
before the hybrid mod I think we might
be able to push 225 now but it'll
probably introduce some artifacts so
let's save that for kind of a a last
resort if we end up meeting it Steve use
Knox for 3000 PWM industrial fans to
improve temps further I think we
actually just got some of those in the
mail we have a bunch of NACO stuff
coming in right now for our wind tunnel
we were showing PC four one nine tech
tip says 2020 Australian dollars thank
you very much for that I appreciate it
loving the live feed all the way from
Melbourne Australia what time is it
there so like around 8 a.m. or something
in parts of Australia that's way too
early way too early for overclocking but
thank you for joining appreciate it
ok so we're running over here what's our
frequency look like so this probably
isn't visible on the camera on the
screen shaking cuz I'm moving the table
but that says 2010 right now that's the
core memory is 10:40 which is quite good
actually I want to push 1060 on that but
it starts exiting our silicon equality
and starts leaning on our liquid cooling
mod a lot but the liquid cooling mod is
doing one very important thing and right
now it's low because we're loading but
it's keeping the clock stable above 2
gigahertz whereas previously we were
dropping down as low as 1600 megahertz
so that is a massive boost to our
performance
Steve notice me senpai hello oh is that
is that a is that BSG I missed the name
Jarrod's tech go Steve go thank you
early it's 222 a.m. here I guess that is
technically early isn't it oh yeah so I
see a Patrick moderator for us he works
for us jumping into chat saying that we
have gaming benchmarks on the site yes
so if you're curious about gaming
benchmarks not just fire strike they are
on the website and on the You Tube
channel we have Titan V game and
benchmarks that are completely separated
from all the other content and that
includes the initial overclocks
what else do we do it we did some clock
testing so we have a really cool test
that was less watched than some of the
other stuff on HBM vs. core overclocking
for the Titan V so specifically how
which does it like more HP Emrick or we
do that with Vega Frontier Edition as
well and it depended actually they were
pretty equal to the point where you know
with Vega let's say it's ten minute
tests you have ten minutes to overclock
something you should choose HP M with
this thing I would probably go core but
it really doesn't matter that much
you're within a couple percent of the
way they both increase it did you do the
shot mod yet no we did not and if we do
it will probably be a separate video or
stream because it would require taking a
lot of stuff apart and I want to see how
far we can go right now well you know
we'll submit one score and start there
and start pushing for more later
Canadian $10 our gratin a Breton says hi
Steve hi thank you
okay say speaking of Windtunnel testing
can you include a test of the Delta
large name 120 millimeter fans as well I
possibly there's a lot of stuff we could
do that score go down looks like it went
down you might have some stability or
something going on yeah I think we went
down and score here we went down and
combined for sure
so what caught what caused our dip let's
try and try something else
tater tots are fries you know there's a
lot of variables there I mean it's not
really an objective test is it talked
about I like you're talking like waffle
fries or are we talking like the the
crispy small McDonald's fries I think I
don't know if we can do a test of that
limited parameter I would go with the
inner dots with equal he cooked let's
try something here we've got a profile
saved that I was working on last night
and I don't know if it's stable so what
have we just done we've loaded a profile
that I was working on last night needs
some stability checking we're at 48 X on
the core we'll see if it boots
so that's 4.8 gigahertz voltage we're at
one point two six seven it's gonna get
quite hot I think our liquid metal will
sustain us but not not only for the
duration of the testing for this short
one point three seven five on VSA one
point three two on VC C IO we've done a
500 on core offset for voltage and I
think we're at thirty yeah her
we're still at thirty for the mesh ratio
to probably try to push 30 to memory
we're at four gigahertz sixteen
seventeen sixteen thirty six now and I
think we saw one command right yes so
let's give that a shot and see how it
does that's something I was working on
last night and I didn't stability test
tater tots are fries someone says you
know I'm tired of people like you
marginalizing the differences between
them
all right frankly I'm surprised that in
this day and age you can even get away
with doing that see we have what three
more a postbox two dollars keep it up
fellow 79 80 XE user here interesting
stuff thank you and I hope you're
enjoying your 79 80 XE always curious if
people use this for production or just
because they're enthusiasts to British
pounds from prob who says our pop sorry
he says here buy some aluminum aluminum
foil tap thank you tape I think I think
that's tape leave leave Eric $10 a
little something towards the second
Titan V yeah $10 will get us pretty
close to that thank you that I really
appreciate it in the very least will go
towards tater tots to spike those of you
who disagreed with that statement after
the stream just just out of spite
that's what I'll spend it on okay so
let's see how that does I think we're
getting some coil wine now from
something I'm not sure what though let's
see if it even runs
Anthony cries our $2 dogs or cats oh I
got to go with cats because if I didn't
our senior AMD analyst snowflake would
start jumping up and down the house
benches with nvidia cards just just
because i said dogs if i did which i
didn't want to make that very clear
see curly fry masterrace okay feel like
this is going like going to like EVGA
stream levels anyone familiar with the
EVGA stream i was on their stream at pax
and the only comment for the entire
stream was people talking about hot dogs
and asking us to do a hot dog teardown
so we were doing a hybrid teardown that
was far less interesting to them then i
think one of the EVGA employees who was
there went and bought a hot dog when
those messages kept coming in in the
convention center where they like $20
and brought it back and it was the most
disgusting looking food i've ever seen
that we did not do a teardown of it
specifically because of the presentation
but they were committed they were
committed to that meme 20 bucks for that
one convention food is awful
mod matte is expensive AF yes so the GN
mod matte which i have here this is an
anti-static mat it's a real anti-static
mat it's made by a factory that makes
stuff for clean rooms and it's a two
millimeter thick rubber and rubberized
surface has a custom paint job on it and
in the corner over here it's kind of
barely visible this thing so this is a
common ground point it's called and I'm
not sure which one we're lufthansa right
now but the other end of this cable it
terminates in a metal loop which goes
around your grounding pin and that plugs
into the wall so that grounds you and
the mat to make sure everything's safe
then out of the other end you have a
banana plug coming out of there with a
wrist strap so anti-static wrist strap
these are both included the common
ground point and the wrist strap
and so yeah the mat is a good rubberized
material it will protect the surface of
the table you're working on and also
ground you and everything else to make
sure the components are safe from stupid
mistakes like ESD so yeah it's it's it's
pretty high quality it's also 4 foot by
2 5 4 by 2
it's pretty big and you know it's got a
custom paint job so we're pretty happy
with it to give you an idea the blue mat
anyone who's seen us you've probably
seen the blue mat on our table that's an
anti-static mat as well that one cost oh
yeah it's on the table over here
actually one of them so that cost me the
same cost me a hundred bucks to buy one
of those retail and ours of course I
think ours is better but yeah so that's
the mat good quality anti-static mats
are generally expensive anyway the GN
mat is deadly worthwhile plus you're
sporting GN thank you for that yeah they
are so like it's shocking how much this
specialized like desk Oh is a good
example I think that's what they called
yeah desk oh is one of the companies
that they they actually buy some of the
same stuff we've seen online and and
rebrand it but they also make their own
anti-static mats they don't call them
mod mats but it's same idea just without
the print on it and they're expensive
now they're good quality and good
quality stuff like that yeah it runs
runs a bit higher so we're going down
and score right now and why is that is
that because of the memory change so I
think we had a higher score when I was
at like 30 thought a like CL 19 or
something pretty sure this is higher
start screenshotting these I guess
physics is I'm not sure physics is lower
why not use both Titan B's unfortunately
they will not they will not work for
this test but it would be a bit unfair
okay so let's see I'm trying to fit I
was looking at chat to see if anyone had
any ideas why we're going down and score
I'm thinking we're losing on combined
score which is interesting so let's make
sure all the settings are applied likely
getting GPU errors yeah you know it
might be worth dropping that a bit okay
so
we're cpu-z
we can drop that HP on clock that's the
main change I made I think so we're at
4.8 successfully the voltage looks a
little funny memory is correct okay
let's try this let's drop this to like
150 and just see what it does just a
troubleshoot background processes you
know that's a good point too we might
have some kind of a dirty wall power
that's another good point his windows
like the fender running to this crap out
of here where are these settings go No
no no no okay just make sure that's not
running an eating CPU cycles we don't
need that okay see how that goes
so our still had a 150 offset on the HBM
we have room to go up if it's stable
yeah we might have pushed the overclock
a bit past what what is technically
stable yeah we should launch hardware
info as well I don't think the vrm is
throttling that's a good point though
the GPU vrm should not be throttling for
sure let me go I don't have a
thermocouple a handy I don't think
so that mic might be getting a lot of
wind right now I'm just kind of shooting
at one of the caps down there
no those are those are good there's
pretty happy actually they'll they're
really not bad I don't think we're vrm
throttling that's hey we're definitely
not VR I'm throttling that's not even
hot to attach that heatsink I should
have put a thermocouple on there first
but we don't really need it on that
board there is an event viewers a good
question too okay so we've got a few
things we can do we have some action
items hardware info and Event Viewer
potentially get a look at the hardware
info I think first Titan V score zero
and fire strike worst card ever okay Abe
Lincoln donated $2 Wow
man doesn't Abe on the is any on the
penny with five didn't even go with like
a denomination that your face is on
thank you appreciate it I guess
inflation is pretty bad isn't it
make sure an Nvidia control panel power
management mode is set to prefer maximum
performance that's also something worth
checking yes
VC CSA is too high we can look at that
too okay so a power management mode
we'll look at that first I'm gonna write
that down because it's gonna go away
actually I can type it can I know I
don't wanna mess up that machine it's
working don't throw on a mess of the
functional computer it's a power
management
and then vccs a timings yeah I got that
one
so our sa voltages might be too high all
right
do a shot mod please not right now
let's see is it tightened beep
power-limited yes at this point we are
not thermal limited we are definitely
power limited at this point and there's
not much we can do about it builds oi
apparently had already kind of figured
out what he wanted to do if he had the
card for hard mods physical mods to the
card but I don't have that capability
I'm seeing people say audio out of sync
I don't know
what's the that's a fade transition
thing yeah I don't know sorry
the pop donated one died you that no
message I don't think attached to it
okay so our score went back up why don't
we change again and we dropped is that
the only thing we did we drop the memory
frequency so question now is is that
coincidence or is that because it was
unstable in throwing memory errors
during the benchmark where are we 31 7 9
1 that puts us at 8 so we were back at 8
we are we're a good bit behind 7th let
me see what do we have to screenshot to
submit a score I think it's like cpu-z
we just like save this before I can't
get back up to it or something I think
you need cpu-z a couple instances of it
I'll check this I actually have a
example okay so score needs to be
visible and all the scores need to be
visible gpu-z graphics card gpu-z up
some of these are optional sensors CPU
mainboard memory obviously I've never
submitted scores before a CPU mainboard
memory
I'll check chat in a second and GP Izzie
we need a couple of graphics card the
sensors isn't really gonna give us
anything valuable because it's not
running right now but ok so I think we
need a screen shot with all this stuff
in there
can't resize that one okay so now we
play a game of move stuff around
mainboard
memory
hopefully I'm not covering anything
important here and now I don't think so
okay so let's just screenshot that
okay I checked chat make sure no one's
freaking out saying I did something
wrong
okay so memory probably throttling yeah
I think I think we were hitting a limit
on that memory that GPU memory clock see
oh yeah we're gonna check that a maximum
performance thing I don't know if it
actually will matter where is that even
hidden in here I have not used that set
in and their ages see so I don't what
else should we be working on here for a
increase in scores I guess stabilize in
that memory if we can maybe we can do
175 power management mode optimal power
prefer maximum performance okay let's
see if that actually matters I'm
skeptical that Nvidia's options do much
more than placebo it at these kind of
clocks but we'll try it
so 30179 one to refresh our on how far
are we behind JP Mboya I don't think I'm
gonna catch him he's at 32 6-4 something
641 so we're trying to get if if we want
to get up to seventh 32 641 graphics
score 36 so we are marginally we're
basically tied in graphics we are pretty
damn close and physics were basically
ahead in physics and he's still ahead
and combined so for anyone who knows
fire strike this well what creates the
combined score that's what I want to
know what I we only use the graphics
test for our reviews so I don't want to
know what's compositing this I'm
guessing it has something to do with
memory because that's my weakest setting
right now he's got a higher CPU clock
that's probably Alvin but only 100
megahertz
memory timings aren't that different so
alright let's let's let this run while I
kind of think about options and read
chat I should play close all this stuff
so all we've done is 25 extra megahertz
on the GPU a texture filtering the high
performance may boost it a little more I
don't know what settings were I don't
know if that tweak is even allowed that
one I just did by the way and the
drivers we didn't have that on
previously so I don't I don't know their
rules that we'll have to look it up
where are the chumps located I don't
have one torn down but I can kind of
show you on this card so there are three
shunts primarily there's one down here
that's basically for the PCIe slot and
then there are two more that are roughly
over here one is kind of right in this
area and we think that goes to the six
pin
there's another one over here on the
other side of a choke and that goes we
think to the eight pin so it'd be these
two that you want to mess with I think
there's actually another one down here
and we're not sure what it does right
now so there's a lot of shunts there but
the top two that are like vaguely here
are the ones you'd want to short
okay reading chat do you know the Titan
via certified drivers like the XP I
don't I would assume so but yeah I don't
know if it does should be it should be
on their website I would think okay any
other you're not g-sync sorry even
though we are not weighted average
that's kind of what I was thinking as
well combine this single threaded
limited if that's true we're behind a
lot of points for being at four point
eight versus four point nine but maybe
we're throttling I can I'll check
hardware info and see if we are possible
our CPU is getting too hot is changing
CPU priority of fire strike allowed and
would that help I don't know the answer
to either of those let's see
what is our hanne-liebe $20 10 DS for
you thank you I'll combine that with the
$10 from earlier and get ten days and
tots three dollars from de cripple who
has no message but thank you
oh did another one again to grow beard
for Internet comrade Steve thank you
power plant on Windows and set the
performance mode I got that much right
Steve it's a driver bug what what is a
driver bug vccs a will help with a CCTV
attempt yes okay so we're almost through
this one see if fart or will do one
thing at a time see if the HBM change
mattered if performance is still being
affected you could try we already did
independent power cables tightly in
window manager yet stable Explorer you
see run everything via command is that
allowed do they do that for these
good call on a hundred megahertz
increase being actually a bit more
substantial and I thought okay so I'm
not sure if we're even going up or down
at this point I think we just went let's
see we were at three one seven nine one
three one one five eight so we've
obviously gone down so you know what
let's let's try it one twenty five okay
didn't like that we think that's I think
that's an infinite score and firestrike
see it as a you can't divide by gray
screen
so there's your driver bug he just went
down and it crashed
okay
a bit of it delay there on the button
we're doing pretty well though 31 791 is
not bad I think that's our top right now
that's uh what is that I said eight
eighth place invalid score yeah good
question yeah that one was an invalid
score for some reason after look into
that I was out for a while where is he
now we did 30179 one which was a valid
score and then we just had another was
it I think it was a valid score I'll
open up the screenshot and we did
another one that was an invalid score
and then it crashed shortly after which
is probably contributing to that let me
double-check that 30179 one score
okay that was valid okay cool so this is
where we current Dan this is where we
currently are which is not bad it's
eight we may end up settling for that
and it'll be taken away tomorrow or in
five minutes before I upload hit I don't
know why the other was invalid I would
guess either that Nvidia driver change I
just did or if it can even detect that
or or that was an unstable clock
I would have to think that's allowed
prefer max when performance seems like
it'd be silly not to 120
come on precision 201 does this did 10
increments nine nine nine I don't think
it's gonna do 10 megahertz yeah it
rounds up to like 25 I think if we do
like 178 I'll do like 175
oh no okay actually it was a bit
different than I thought about 165 okay
so I want to try 125 because going down
was increasing our score so maybe it's
still like kind of unstable at that
point just interesting because we don't
see that behavior when we did our our
clock comparison but we ran it with
different applications as well okay so
that go I'm gonna take more questions
and things while that that kind of sits
there or
suggestions at this point
recommendations turn off visual effects
plays George $5 Steve do you have
any recommendations for shampoo and
conditioner and would you ever do
shampoo benchmarks I am I'm not sure
that we would do shampoo benchmarks I've
tried to think of ways we could and I
don't know if we could thermal test them
or I guess you could put them and like
do like a wig and a humidity chamber and
see how it impacts the hair or something
working on it it's our next Channel
did their very comment something
someone's talking mentioning him hide
your our all driver adjustments are
allowed invalid score can happen if it's
unstable and you get wrong timing
readout okay that's actually very
helpful thank you dare Bauer no one if
you don't know who he is do a youtube
search for Dare Bauer de r8a u ER and
subscribed to him he is we worked with
him previously a copy tax the Nova Clark
we did some liquid-nitrogen overclocking
with them for a video at Computex and he
sent us his delayed kit which got us the
79 80 XE deleted so that I could put the
liquid metal on it the conductor not
metal on it so yeah check him out if you
don't know who he is
thank you for that though so yeah all
driver adjustments are allowed just to
read that again invalid score happens
it's unstable or you got the wrong
timings what's the max of voltage for
Volta is it 1093 like Pascal yes yes it
is shorting the shunts might help out a
bit but yeah same it's booze 3.0 is
basically it behaves the same on volt as
Pascal pretty much in every single way
so 10 9 10 10 93 millivolts for that and
we have build Zoids PCB and vrm analysis
coming up tomorrow or the next day which
will contain more voltage information I
took a bunch of readings from the back
of the card or the back plate off while
I was running under different conditions
gave the numbers to him and he through
the calculations you can try and invent
a panel manage 3d texture filtering to
high performance and some benchmarks
that helps okay what was that one
texture performance
setting the first one or two cores 24.9
will increase your combined to score
just got here what settings are we at
hello builds away it's a builds I have
actually hardcore overclock and just
arrived I'll get on discord if you want
to provide any remote advice so we are
currently at 200 megahertz offset on the
core on the GPU and where I think we're
testing right now on 125 on the HBM I
stepped it down 175 and 200 offsets
we're lowering our scores and 150 was
pretty good we were scoring 31 791
points for that which puts us in eighth
and did it go up again no but it's not
really down that much so 150 seems to be
where we want to be for the HBM so let's
set that as that that covers our GPU
information and I'll throw this on the
screen partly for build Zoid partly for
anyone who's catching up now how does I
can't stand Windows 10 okay that's a bit
much so here's our scoring previously
and we are behind and combined score or
a bit ahead if I remember correctly in
physics and we are roughly tied in
graphics and then here's our CPU
information for mr. builds ID and I'll
check I'll check and so this is like is
getting outside help disallowed let me
check and see if we've got okay
so hopefully the discord noises don't go
through to chat if it does line up okay
so yeah the one idea there of sending
the Coors wanted to or zero and one
higher was a good one is a GP voltage
limited yes 1093 millivolts is is it
that's what we got to play with and
there's not much I can do about it
okay so we're still kind of catching up
here on all the chat and everything in
one second
VCCS a lower vccs a then bump core zero
in to overclock so yeah we can try that
let's try that
it's a VC CSA I think someone was asking
about quote Silicon lottery I'm not not
sure that's the same lottery we're
playing here coming for the silicon
lottery you know we should do a video on
that too we've got the two Titan V is we
can do like which one clocks higher can
I already know where this one is
his windows tweaked so full of crap
builds or it says damn down cops here
well I expect the the come on man
expect the minor score that I got to be
beaten shortly then turning hpm back up
to 200 225 since you're getting over 30
we're still getting over 37 K I think
core zero and core 1 okay here's 10 cop
yeah arrives and says here's damn cop
okay so what are we starting with here
Steve do you think do something with
kingpin from EVGA like Jay we have an
interview with kingpin when we met up
with him actually met him the first time
at Computex this year it's on the
channel it's a sharp guy actually I
really want to show his Alan's he's set
up more because it's really cool
he it's almost like an open loop he's
not quite but it's almost like an open
loop Ellen 2 type of thing where I kind
of feeds back into itself really cool
setup we didn't really film it enough so
suggestion was si lo er let's try that
let's do 1.35 see if it's stable I feel
like we should party only change one
thing at a time so let's let's go with
that
two Dems are out because I only have two
connected so the kit we're using is it
is a tweaking memory should help for
more combined score okay thank you the
kit we're using is a Corsair kit we only
have two sticks for it it's forty six
hundred megahertz rated it's pretty hard
to actually get that out of it but it's
forty six hundred megahertz CL nineteen
I've stuffed it down to four thousand
and I think we're like sixteen seventeen
sixteen thirty eight or 36 or something
like that so we I don't I don't have
four dims in there that's why I I also
don't know how much dual versus quad
channel matters for fire strike I was
thinking of testing it we do have two
other sticks that are forty to sixty six
CL nineteen but I don't think I'm gonna
get them to match these and I'd rather
run lower scores than deal with the
headache of this thing crashing while I
try and stabilize memory because that's
just not very exciting let's see
just press Delete no need to tap it I've
proved you otherwise during the stream
that is not the case
come on
okay so all we've done has changed us a
voltage and IO voltage and all I'm doing
now is seeing if it doesn't crash and
then we can work on memory some more one
four sticks stressed the IMC more anyway
yeah so part of the reason this board
only has four slots this might be next
to ninety nine is because it should be
more stable but yeah I'm kind of stuck
with two stakes like adding more is just
gonna because I don't have four sticks
of the same kit so then we have the
trouble of like the validating that they
can all reach the same speeds and
frequencies so we're gonna stick with
two sounds kind of delayed yeah we've
been hearing that I don't know what to
do about that sorry mass tapping wears
out the key seriously is that it for
real comment what it like aren't these
switches right if I like fifty million
clicks or something also I don't have a
shortage of keyboards either okay
what keywords one just to use daily
right now I think I have a blue keyboard
I hate the keyboard but I have blue
switches right now let's see increased
CPU cache speed yeah we could do that a
bit more we have it up a little bit
right now we could do more okay so I
think I think we've had a couple of
pre-orders come in for the mattes while
on stream I'll read first name is
Matthew in Australia thank you for
checking that out
Joseph UK thank you Michael
from Canada cool thank you for checking
them out should be shipping I think we
get our first shipment early like first
week no production should be done first
week of January probably which means we
should be able to ship them late January
is kind of the target worst case first
week of February is is my kind of
requirement the people were working with
the factory and all okay so this is
still running let's do in physics right
now so one says the audio is fine
restart your browser you got damn noobs
I didn't say it I just read it
actually hardcore overclocking clicky
switches our best switches yeah so I
actually do like the blue switches I
just hate the keyboard I have because it
double taps a lot I get a lot of
keystrokes I didn't press and part of
its a is part of its spotty needing to
clean it out I was a replace at some
point I think I liked the this is gonna
be controversial
I liked the Romer geez when they came
out and the reason I like them is
because they're pretty quiet and for
purposes of doing things like Skype
calls and stuff having quieter keys is
somewhat beneficial hey that's higher
than previously as valid thirty-one
eight one six we're still a bit away so
all we did was lower the voltage I don't
know if that's high enough to be outside
of margin of error or not you need uh
you need any breaks or anything okay
Andrew on the camera the real MVP
so I think we're in the same spot eight
I'll check chat in a moment thirty one
eight one six we've improved in physics
not sure about combined let me see what
chat says have you ever had a CPU die
that's not caused by two high voltage or
similar I have not had a CPU die I don't
think at all maybe one okay just check
and chat all right
okay so we should screenshot that it's a
bit better I think I know all the things
that we have to have open at this point
it should be a bit faster
it's like back to my RTS days microwave
all the windows memory mainboard CPU GPU
sensors I think that's everything yeah I
want a precision up to you okay
okay so score to beat from ourselves is
eight one six thirty one eight one six
okay what do we do next this is becoming
like twitch plays overclocking at this
point I got us up to thirty one
you guys are getting us the rest away
shiftry still yeah don't need to trigger
people by smashing delete that seems
like the perfect reason to smash tele
andrew are you okay shake the camera if
you need help Kara's not shaken the
light would probably fall off so we
changed this we dropped si by 0.25 and
IO by 0.2 I think maybe we can do
something here like I don't really know
I'm kind of getting out of my league at
this point this is about the most I know
to work on without just causing a lot of
crashing oh that's right someone wanted
us to try overclocking core zero and one
that's right and to save all the
bloatware which is also a good idea if
difficult with windows let's try it just
49 no no
4450 49 eyes are called court 1/4 zero
seems more logical okay so we increase
the ratio 32 or something or should we
just see if this is uh this is stale
first hey here's one here's a good one
why did you beat up Patrick stone stone
is um is a contributor he's worked with
us a lot over the years and it goes to
CES with us 1.25 on SI okay we can try
that really if that seems like big job
but okay I'm just gonna go with that
guy's well I'll read your other
suggestions on the next one stones
worked with us a long time he is a
computer engineering teacher Oh
oh yeah that's right he had a black eye
in some of our videos I wasn't from me
build Zoid said something CRE fi 232 K
okay
yo yeah if I had a 32 K
see our is that in here is that what
we're talking about right now
tre Fi we're at fifteen thousand six
hundred you want to go up to 30 2 K is
that correct not VCC I okay got it
how much of a corporate scheme is RGB
it's built so it gave me a suggestion
I'm just trying to clarify if that if I
understood it correctly can we get on a
call I don't think I have the capability
to do that unfortunately right now
1.25 and Otto okay
okay T RFC and Tre fi4 kmm clock doesn't
need 1.3 ok fix that then T RFC and tre
fi are easy free timings improve on T
RFC with that kit 350 ish T bar EF I 32k
32767 okay let's try that actually I'm
gonna copy that comment - okay that's
not what I tried to copy 32767 t7 what
was the other one t RFC yeah that's
right
350 okay well let's see on our way yeah
okay let's try that
alright I'll see how that goes so T RFC
is one I do have a little bit of
experience with not CR EFI I think is
what it was called but T RFC Patrick was
looking at for us for an upcoming piece
and yeah we we were just looking at Auto
XMP like out of box timings and how you
can basically get we did some tuning
with T RFC specifically and gain like 5%
FPS on some other boards in some games
just by tuning that one o'clock
do you like RTS games yeah RTS games are
where my core is on row when I played a
lot of games take hit rid of that so
let's see how this one does
okay
Precision's back
so we're doing still 150 on the HP mm
still 200 on the core see what that does
this time ripped camera man
you may need it 32-gigabyte oh that's
right we also changed a core 1 &amp;amp; 2
didn't we yes BC LK is currently 100
you've got everything I can help with
now ok thank you
gr 82 banana tiger
did you like generals generals was when
I kind of stopped playing CNC I played
the first CNC I played the second one I
actually for the longest time thought
the first command &amp;amp; Conquer was in black
and white because I didn't realize that
on the system I had installed it on the
if he went to properties for the game
advanced you could set the bit depth the
color depth and whatever I did not
knowing what I was doing in there as you
can see nothing has changed whatever I
did there changed it to all black and
white so for the longest time I thought
the game was black and white RTS game is
a real-time strategy yes it's a stable
so far
I got a $2 donation Australian I think
from Vitor Zen he says can you do a test
on the worst optimized games 7 d TD 7
days days to die is that it how much it
would be on that list wouldn't it that
might be worth looking at
2 euros need to ask afterburner of
rescission 2017 thanks they kind of do
the same thing I like precision right
now I've used afterburner a lot
afterburner I think has better
presentation of sensors and data and
precision is just kind of quick and easy
for me to work with right now and I know
it works at this card afterburner over
to Titan v2 though oMG it's dare 8-hour
someone says yes there Berezin chat they
say something general is his life best
CNC ever still playing it really that EA
killed that series it's really
unfortunate I bought it and they killed
it like everything else they buy damn
Capri mailing us some altitude for
Christmas CNC renegade is the only one I
haven't played I really liked Red Alert
one was great
Tiberian Sun was really cool as well and
a firestorm I think was on there
aftermath was a good expansion
I liked the nurple maps a lot if anyone
remembers those there the user custom
maps we're not getting any artifacts by
the way presently and those maps had
cool things were like the civilians
basically useless characters you know
units in the game civilians would shoot
nukes out of their crappy pistols medics
would open their medic kit and like dogs
would jump out and kill the evil that's
cool is that that's higher right so
we're out 32,000 thank you YouTube plays
overclock and YouTube place fire strike
for supporting so let's recap I got here
mostly on my own
you guys are getting us past here so far
so for anyone who has done here I think
my score without help was about 31 791
and with help we're going up now at a
32,000 I think we've increased in a
couple of places so score to beat 32,000
641 we have 600 points to go let's just
go ahead and save this one as well
I'll check chat in the moment actually
I'll check chat right now just see if
anyone has said anything about that
score
okay Company of Heroes 2 is free now
really Company of Heroes is a oh it's
not a bad game either I was big in age
vampires especially three good Matt a
good price on your mats compared to the
3m SES ESD math we use at work yeah tell
me about it we buy the expensive ones
back before we could just make our own
and I can relate
now it's kind of cool because if I need
more we can just use our own stuff
so 32,000 78 I think we can do fire
strike as well once we're kind of good
on this one we will just throw over to
that one - oh yeah and we also
overclocked the first core and second
core all this open here okay save that
one all right what's the suggestion now
you could try one more bump encore one
into you with a little more V core yeah
we could do that
Starcraft 2 is free to play now as well
I heard that have you done anything into
Windows 10 game mode settings have had
weird performance behavior in light
games we don't use game mode I don't
like it any comments about the overclock
in make a self-healing mat around 20 to
30 bucks and I'm buying it I don't know
what technically constitutes a
self-healing mat I know that when we
stab the hole on this one it mostly
filled itself but I don't know how how
many times you can do that
let's should we just see if this is
stable thoughts thoughts on this 5
gigahertz on the first to be CLK 104 to
105 what's the what's the consensus on
that
see if I mean this with driver buggy
gta5 benchmark 1440p dx11 you have 91
FPS the x10 same settings you have I
yeah I don't know it's DX 10 verse 11 I
don't I'm not sure I haven't tested that
lets see any suggestions rip cameraman
use liquid nitrogen yeah thanks
suggestion 5,600 CPU 2400 1200 GPU Oh
Alan - yeah okay thank you builds white
mesh clock should go to around three
point two three point five uncork could
help uh yeah we can try that I think
we're at three right now let's try three
point two it's three by two
let's see if that's stable actually
before we lose everything
okay check and chat one more time vcore
may need a bump yet we'll see getting
kind of close to our thermal limits here
I think when does the mod mat ship late
January first week of February is my
target
so we've done two changes it might not
be one is the mesh clock and one is the
first two cores
okay oh yeah what is our we should check
the power consumption during the next
bench if it's stable
Yassir builds Lloyd's in the chat there
Barrow was in here earlier clearly this
is stable we're gonna increase B core a
bit
need a more efficient way to get around
max memory clock on Volta we did was
1066
but our score was going down earlier
when we went that high so we've dropped
it yeah oh yeah I forgot the lead didn't
I
changing appearance of windows yeah so
stable
blue-screen no stability yeah I think we
need more V core
and also numpad would be good or NumLock
to 6/7 do 1.27 or something so our score
anyone just getting here now we were at
32,000 something lower digits 32,000
which puts us in about 8 on fire strike
and seventh plays as I think about 600
points ahead of me it's getting kind of
hard to push much further at this point
okay take that hex code from the blue
screen and convert decimal and that's
your score we got to give Windows a
moment to figure out what it's doing
with its life
reading talents see all 12 for thousands
not happening okay we just we're still
unstable I think so more vcore I guess
what CPU is at 79 80 X e 18 core CPU we
are yes it is yeah so we're pushing for
5 gigahertz on the first 2 cores and 4.8
on the others and we just need to get it
stable
may need 1.28 450 on the first two cores
we will see meat or 2 dollars Australian
tallies aura or build Zoid who's the
better OC er I gotta go with my man
builds wide because I don't know
anything about the other person
alright tor just kind of take it easy
here's our one point two seven five
that's kind of a decent size job
we'll go to one point two eight that's
not good
one point three CPU I'm trying three
five mesh yeah this is Dan cow okay so
101.4 be CLK this is the Danika is
danica basically just gonna like proxy
take the score through our account one
so he's suggesting one point three volts
CPU 1.35 mesh
I think he's suggesting that 49 CPU all
cores I'm assuming and 32 mesh
build settings dan can't recommend it
sound good okay well let's try on them
so yeah I've got a bunch of actual
overclockers in chat who are proxy
overclocking through us partly probably
I guess because we've got Titan V's
please come on come on
don't knock that thing that I see yeah
damn cops got a score pretty high up
there there Bowers got a score pretty
high up there
down cop with a long-range record hack
all right so I believe his suggestion
was 49 all core come on
why does num lock turn off 49 all core
and 1.35 match 1.3 on voltage II how he
played in Y 1.3 I might start running
into thermal limits at some point
what were the other suggestions here 1.3
5 volts in mash and 32 match 101.4 BC
okay
32 match we're already at 101.4 and over
the other one point three five volts
mesh volts it's mesh
at what point at what point to the
long-range overclockers just give me
sabotage settings
just kill this system
do you have push-pull on the rads I do
not and I don't even have a very good
set of fans on there we have NZXT fans
on there right now
the decent but not for this so those may
have to go
not Prime's table waste of time
yes we are definitely about time to
break out on to postcode Post beep
happened put the rags in front of AC
ducts I was thinking about putting it
out the window
Steve have you ever gotten your hair
caught in a fan no thankfully by the way
if you have game mode off ok
two dollars from Philip love the live
stuff keep it up
Thank You Philip glad you liked it two
dollars from con gone Tower who says use
a man's motherboard asus rog we're on
the x-29
dark right now you're near max on V core
don't run 1.3 for long periods
understood
are we unstable still
you have V core at 30 Dan cop-killing
the system would be 1.5 but I know
custom loop for the hybrid mods I mean
because this works and if I can put it
on more benches without having to
unbilled it and stuff like that I'm
going to be testing it on two or three
different benches so
stick the rat in a bucket of ice water
yeah that would also help out
so we're unstable what are thoughts here
voltage stability shouldn't be thrown
walls they're not even booting
can rename builds oi to help desk on
discord poor builds Oh
I did not accidentally do 101 point two
five it changed it that
dan cop test physics first if it doesn't
run go for one point three eight volts
match one point three five core what if
it's not booting one point three eight
mesh one point three five core if it's
not stable on physics okay these these
need to get out
okay
do it baby
let's go thank you
$5.00 from Tallulah rose just cuz why
not thank you
see what's the best bench you'd
recommend it though one bench tables not
bad I'm eating from something from
high-speed PC it's like $250 though
damn it sorry
kind of miss I'm gonna miss it again
what is the outside temperature there
probably like 30 or 35 or something okay
what's Dan cups and system speed won't
help that much so yeah I mean what do we
do at this point we lower the settings a
bit
that's where at 32 mesh could use some
work I guess so
we were doing a 30 we're doing 50 on the
first two cores previously I think
having trouble with stability I do a
safe boot then we were doing 48 on the
others I believe
see on the 14 core I can't go past 1.3
at 5 let's build zone okay
1.35 on the 18 cores too much for an AI
oh yeah I think it probably is we're
getting pretty close to the max already
okay all right
so be CLK back to 100 that might be a
reasonable suggestion
because before our changes so we have a
couple things we can do here
we could try 49 on all when we go up to
1.3 for 1.28 maybe just you want to
fight three to see if it's stable
what was the other suggestion we did
there was a mesh change 1.35 I think
1.35 and we can what's our mesh ratio 30
to 32 here's our memory timings anyone
wants to see those while I catch up on
chat for a second okay
EVGA BIOS interface looks cool they've
improved it a lot they really have 4.9
gigahertz to stable okay could use a OBS
yeah I mean we were using OBS but it has
problems with when we were crashing we
were having trouble getting it back
without unplugging stuff
okay
you wanna take a break you don't you
know I'll lock the camera I go grab a
drink or anything okay so we're just
gonna try this can't do this forever but
we'll see how it goes
yeah it's not that hot in here get the
windows open
what LLC settings are you using probably
although honestly we do have a capture
card we were using it we have like it
has really expensive capture card that
we used to review our benchmarking but
we're just I mean it it was causing
issues this happened cuz I didn't I
don't think I said the boot drive okay
Oh CF stock VCC Ayanna's too high happy
drive
okay 1.38 mesh well let's see what's
first
it didn't do because the drive wasn't
correct single GP record correct I mean
we're not gonna get first talking to
happen but right now we're basically
fighting for 7 we're in eighth
run two volts peak or don't think so
yeah so we're at 32,000 firestrike right
now if you if you go to google and you
type in HW baat firestrike you should
find a rankings list for a single GPU
that's where we're competing I haven't
submitted scores yet and I'm sure
someone else out there is working on
beating ours
is it let's give it a second and see
what it does we can do 1.35 mesh or
something's here
for instance and wattage isn't very high
it's not doing anything
three blue screen yes machine check
exception cheers for Sunday Argo
entertainment Sydney Australia from
Glenn thank you for watching
okay if we could like actually redo
after the failure
okay
Nega 64 the Mass Effect Andromeda of
GPUs from vitor Raya just readin it okay
dan cop little the stable set in and go
for better cooling on the GPU we on the
GPU then you should get the record
easily put some AC in front of the GPU
so Dan cop you think I think we're at
like think we're doing like forty eight
or something see on the GP right now so
to clarify you think that pulling that
further is what we need that's what
that's what I'm just clarifying we've
got a 280 CLC on it right now with the
Maglev fans and yeah we I maybe I could
put it in front of the AC and the AC on
put out the windows you if it has to be
in the other room though I wouldn't be
able to stream it set up here is not
gonna work for it so was a world record
done we are at number eight yeah we need
more a combined score right now I think
I think we're pretty much getting
towards the the end of it that's a
nice-looking mug you got there are those
for sale yes yes they are stored on
cameras and accessed on net when do you
recommend mecaenas link to us pushing
5.1 cpu to get 34 K yeah I think that's
kind of a kind of what our limit is
right now it's hard for me to keep up
with chat though so I may have
overlooked some comments so this was
like almost stable earlier
where's mesh mesh
and 1.3 okay increase those think I'm
only gonna give it a couple more tries I
think four for this one unless I see
some more guidance coming that kind of
gets us past it to try one point three
five on four point nine but wouldn't run
that pond yeah yeah it's not a bad idea
5.0 core 14.9 core to four point eight
on the others this card so someone has
this card is 110 teraflops right that's
kind of marketing so this thing does has
tensor cores it does like FP 16 and
stuff like that
ron's we drive and so 110 teraflops that
number was about the I think about the
machine learning performance of the
tensor flow processing so that is not
accurate for floating-point 32 which is
what you'd be comparing against if you
compare those numbers at all for gaming
okay see it see what it does what name
are you registering the score as gamers
Nexus I think it's probably what our
account name is
yes a lot of suggestions to go 49 for
one of the cores
never shot mod yet on the Titan B that's
correct was that light or either Stan
okay I think we're gonna have to drop or
two here
and we do have other stuff we're gonna
have to do at some point
got it burn a tiger I gotcha
mmm-hmm couldn't she disable some cores
we're not gonna do that
okay I'm trying 15:49 let's the only
change I'm making I think
yeah let's see what that does can't do
too much more here
are you surprised at the timing of both
people thought and video would hold it
off for a while no so
Volta when it was shown on the roadmap
it was shown for end of 2017 I believe
which they did or maybe early 2018 and
so I'm not surprised by it
I'm kind of surprised at the product
they chose to launch immediately the
Titan VIII but that's not I don't know
that's they'll do something else for
gaming one the time Tom is right now
they have no pressured to do so the
restart
let's try mass ratio 31
yes the fans are definitely blasting
X 48 plus BC LK maybe so let's bring
this down to 31 I'll keep looking for
other options but I think we're I really
think we're gonna get stuck at 8th place
let's see
yeah International shipping on the mugs
is higher now it's what happens when you
know you're not a retail outlet we're
not a retailer so unfortunately we just
kind of get stuck with whatever the
shipping companies give us
mmm what's the highest score right now
it's about 32,000 the for us not for all
time the person in first is much higher
which is kingpin we're at 32,000 I think
we need to hit 32 6 for one that we
wanted seventh which is clearly about
the limit of what we're gonna be able to
even attempt do we have any room here
for more voltage not really yeah I do
think we're at about max without
changing the cooling solution see I
think we'll actually see Volta and
GeForce or what we get another pax well
what was it ampere or something which
was rumored previously I think bits and
pieces a volt I will I ball I think a
lot of Volta will be the foundation of
whatever comes out for games
captain donated 10 Canadian thank you
hurry poutine
oh maybe one with 49 on four cores
but adjusting I'll see help I don't know
maybe the studio light effect
temperature that's actually good score
or kick it's correct good question
not really we're using all LED lights if
we use halogens then definitely if you
have 1500 watts to run those increase
your room ambient by like 11 degrees and
six hours if you're running 1500 watt
like old-school halogen studio lights
how much is the v100 the V 100 Tesla is
part of the developer kit it's $10,000
the Titan V also V 100 G V 100 is $3,000
I bought the one we have in the system
and we have another on loan I do think
that we're probably gonna call it quits
but I'll do one more I'll do a victory
lap with the settings if I can remember
them that we're stable but I don't know
that I can at this point
let's see mesh on auto add more sticks
of RAM - I'm not going to do that I
think yeah I've kind of explained that
situation a bit already we might be able
to but I mean what do we even have for
memory in here 16 gigabytes get into a
point where I would need to get some
different hardware cooling or something
okay so I think I think this was stable
previously
and
1.3 ok that's we don't even need that I
don't think I think we did that and then
the mesh we had on auto which we can
just put it back there if we're just
doing like a one more test type of thing
oh no wait
boot drive okay let's bring up three
boot and come back in to get that I did
love the profile I but we have a
different the profile is not stable
quad-channel doesn't really help
firestrike much if at all build Zoid
says this the board can backup settings
and i did load them but we also over
wrote that profile with one of the other
ones but i remembered most the changes
so but did I say the stable one okay
which was 50 right wasn't that 50 I
don't I don't know if that was stable
you're saying I saved this stable one
okay well whatever let's do this
let's see
five gigahertz on any CD cores at 1.3
isn't happening how much faster all v100
be over tighten the V 100 is the Tesla V
100 has been out for a while it has more
memory as such it has a wider bus for
the memory so it's got more memory
bandwidth I'm not sure about the core
clock I don't think that's too different
it has the same core count
50 was was changed after staving and
then rebooted I thought so okay
yes 49 was stable
how much of a gentleman before until the
next-gen cards will really be say what's
48 with four okay got it gotcha
so gentlemen performance I we were
seeing anywhere from 4 percent to 40
percent increase on this card over the
Titan XP it depended entirely on the
game we have a benchmark video up called
Titan V gaming benchmarks you're curious
and that should answer the question I
would suspect that next generation would
largely follow that I will tell you now
I'm almost confident that Nvidia is
targeting improvement specifically an
asynchronous compute applications and
DirectX 12 and Vulcan lower-level
ap is they are looking to gear up to
compete where am d presently does it can
beat very well and you can see some of
that in our in our benchmarks we've
published well any difference now oh
that's right we have a different uncor
yeah we can change that man but now the
Tigers on point this whole time
okay how was it stream been by the way
in terms of video quality I need like
pretty fluid the whole time I know
you've got some audio complaints we can
look into what was encore was it 30 or
something
we mash we put to auto we could increase
that again I don't know where we were
with this the 31 mesh was at 30 and last
day well okay that's what I thought
so we'll give 31 a shot and then we'll
give up and go back to 30
Glenn oh I already read that one I
already read those comments great audio
and video entire stream 32 mesh got us
the 30 mm point score okay
no real drops from complaints apparently
yeah weird I don't know if something's
obviously different I should have saved
the separate profile but let's just get
into Windows at this point and pull up
the score
so 32,000 I think is where we're
stopping
great great to be and a you Tiger watch
gold a you as in gold so we're just
gonna boot
let's do come on wake up
okay 48 and I think it's the 30th no
builds oh it says 32 is what we use so
okay see that boots
builds re video quality is fine OC
quality wants to rip my eyes fly out
here man
I'll give you the cards in the system
bring your Ellen to pots we've got a
Dewar container out here
you're welcome to have at it
Auburn University hey you I thought I
thought we were talking that period a
periodic table of elements okay so let's
take a look at that score thirty-two
thousand seventy eight that's where
we're gonna stop so because I mean we've
been doing this like a couple hours now
sir our settings thirty-two thousand
seventy eight got us thirty seven ish
36.6 this is where we're behind is
combined score so much significantly for
as the seventh place can't do much about
that apparently but maybe someone like
build joy kid if they flew out here and
did it for us
cpu-z Paulo Jay Paul J and get kingpin
in here so we were at four point nine I
think we had manually tune the cores one
and two and then for the memory we
haven't really changed much from here if
anything I don't think we've changed
anything here
oh is that yeah kids me we were at 30
okay so I think our stable was maybe a
30 for the mesh right either way I think
that's where we're stopping so let's
pull up we'll just see where that'll go
if once I submit it so has anyone has
anyone uh shaking up the board since we
started so we still be an eighth right
now and behind JPM boy who's got the
first Titan V I think on this chart so
we're the last Titan V which I obviously
bumps us ahead a bit unfairly but so
that's where we are combined score maybe
because you're running dual rather than
quad I don't know at this point I'm I'm
at the the limit of my knowledge so
here's what we're gonna do I will submit
that under the name gamers an access
hopefully it's got everything in there
that they want for a submitted score
okay builds I'd says he was wrong about
encore so I think it was 30 I think it's
the uncor that's making us unstable and
yeah we might be able to work on that if
we did another stream so here's what
we're gonna do I'm gonna talk to builds
roid later and we'll see if he has any
ideas if it's even worth pursuing this
further in a separate stream maybe we
could short the shunts on the card or
something like that but I'm happy with
this for now it's the first attempt I've
ever done it's something like this we
had a bit of an advantage by nature of
having the hardware we do but it's good
learning experience so I'll take eight
and I'll call it quits there as for
everything else after this stream ends
within the next couple minutes we will
be publishing a Titan V hybrid mod where
we turned that card into the card it is
now so you can catch that if you stick
around subscribe for all of that and
then if you want to check out the mod
map we've been using for all of our tear
downs and things lately stored on
cameras Nexus Donette slash mod matte we
had a couple more pre-orders a lot more
pre-orders so we picked let me to read

pronounce your name I'm sorry from the
US also in New York and we had Mike from
