hardware news recap we have some pretty
major news for the last week actually
including some key ek water blocks
members who were in the executive team
moving over to Corsair which is pretty
interesting
and then also Andy confirming rise into
four quarter one 2018 and we've also got
a couple rollouts of rx Bega cards from
sapphire and MSI along with a couple of
other minor news items before getting to
those that this coverage is brought to
you by EVGA and their 1080 T is c2 which
we've recommended fairly highly for its
build quality and the icx sensors which
are kind of fun to play with you can
check our full SC 2 review for the 1080i
if you're curious to learn more or you
can click the link in the description
below to find the product page for the
1080i SC - speaking of minor news items
our minor celebrity judges are gonna be
Riley from NCIX tech tips and Steve from
gamers Nexus according to Linus I was a
minor judge on their tech showdown
series that's airing right now and
totally agree with him by the way I
think he meant in celebrity status
because the other judges on there
included a none t IX tech tips member
Riley ripped to NCIX tech tips and
iJustine so I guess with that as
perspective yes but yeah so we're on
tech showdown I will be in probably the
last episode as a judge he's already
made that public and we shot this back
in September when I was up there for we
were up there just after packed it
should be pretty fun it was definitely
fun to be a judge on the show Bob
Stewart and rod Rosenberg are competing
against Linus and Luke to do a custom
mod P seem odd that is themed like candy
I guess for the holidays so Bob and rod
do great work and we'll see how Linus
and Luke - I'm actually I actually
haven't seen how they built their system
that I ended up judging so I'm really
curious to see how it came together and
as I said when I was there I found it
more difficult to judge their finished
machines than I do to judge products
were reviewing I guess primarily because
like they're not a massive corporation
and they were standing right there and
you could see every excruciating
expression how minuses face as the
heroes with each criticism with Bob and
rod prodding him Alon and they got their
own fair share of heavy criticism as
well so it should be fun go check it out
on his channel
I think first episodes up already
getting to the real news instead of the
minor news we have the corsair EK
management move so this one coarser
acquired mark tanco and niko timid are i
believe i don't know how it's pronounced
from the CEO and the CTO formerly of EK
water blocks who were replaced about a
couple weeks ago actually and so the
former EK water blocks talent is now
moving to Corsair mark tanco is now the
vice president and business unit general
manager at corsair and then tibideaux
TVR becomes the director of engineering
of course there's a pretty big roles for
them they had several other EK members
leave with them when they left I'm not
sure presently if any of them moved over
to Corsair as well but we'll see what
course arms up making it should be
interesting because both those guys have
experience in custom loops obviously
so maybe coarser we'll start pushing
more into that direction they showed off
some custom loop products at Computex
this year that were basically re badges
but we'll see if they go properly custom
this time next up at a recent press
event AMD confirmed the second
generation of rise in desktop CPUs again
and noted that they are slated for first
quarter 2018 the new chips will be
comprised of both pinnacle Ridge and
Raven Ridge apu silicon and both are
based on a 12 nanometer shrink the new
generation of CPUs will debut alongside
the AMD 400 series chipset but will
still drop into a m4 sockets and and the
300 series chipsets alike with a BIOS
update so you will be able to use X 370
and its compatriots as long as you
update the BIOS the new rise in CPU and
apu listings will carry the 2000 series
model numbers on them
and the microarchitecture is still Zen
not Zen too so it's it's a Zen plus
basically kind of like Intel's been
doing this Plus thing on their 14
nanometer plus 40 nanometer plus plus
Zen plus it's coming out and that's
first quarter we'll see how it does
sapphire and MSI are rolling out custom
RX Vega cards MSI so back when there
were rumors of gigabyte allegedly not
planning to make any custom or expand
your cards it turned out they were
planning to do it and MSI were the ones
when we spoke with them who basically
said we have no plans right now and they
said that for probably about a month it
looks like that changed they are making
a custom rx Bega 64 now custom loosely
here it's still a blower cooler I
believe they call it a lateral blower
and they make a sort of a deal about it
having a copper core and a separate base
plate which is what you would describe
as a blow or cooler so I don't know how
different that will be from reference
sapphires is a bit different from
reference they have a nitro plus and
that's for 56 and 64 with a
significantly larger cooler a bigger
heatsink all that stuff so that should
be interesting as well Emma sighs the
latest custom offering will just
basically be slightly overclocked and
then blower design next news item Intel
is launching Gemini Lake SOC s so these
are their new Pentium silver and Celeron
atom processors and built on 40
nanometer technology the seller on SOC s
and Pentium will use gold mount plus
architecture and they are aimed at
low-power desktops and mobile so all
these products won't interest really any
of you or many of you anyway and it's
the pentium line that gets interesting
because intel's rebranded pentium now as
pentium silver and pentium gold pentium
gold is effectively what the g 45 60
would be or has become and pentium
silver is sort of exiting our area of
coverage as it gets towards lower end or
turn ative products that are outside of
the enthusiasts space so kind of decent
changes there in terms of the product
stack and the marketing the SOC is of
course being an SOC or system-on-chip
it's quite a bit different in what we'd
be used to working with anyway it's it's
not a drop-in part like you'd use for
any of the socket at CPUs so that's what
they've got coming out on the Intel side
it's all targeted at low power the
Intel's got a couple of skews for
desktop that are low-power as well they
are suffixed with 80 usually depending
on the generation although that seems
I've carried through and that's how you
can identify the lower TDP parts MSI is
debuting an optics series of displays so
this is the optics mag and MSI is
working on curved gaming displays now so
they just started pushing it to displays
in the past year or so and this one the
mag family will have three models
they've got an 1800 hour curvature
display with a VA panel LED panel and
native 144 Hertz refresh and that also
has one millisecond great gray and free
sync all the models will have the usual
sort of marketing driven blue light
reduction anti flicker all that stuff
you could get separately if you wanted
to but they have it too and they also
have resolutions of 1080 1440 going from
23.62 27 inches and no word on pricing
or availability but the new models are
supposed to be debuting sometime this
month December bit late on the holiday
boat but they're trying anyway the air
boost 64 by the way is the other MSI
product that Vega 64 card final news
item here Thermaltake is introducing the
view 22 case so this is the latest mid
tower from thermaltake it's a tempered
glass Edition case and it's four
millimeter thick panels full length PSTU
cover and that shrouds the hard drive
the SSD and the power supply and it's
cables all like it's got a single 120
millimeter exhaust fan kind of like the
core g20 one I believe had and it's got
room for seven fans that
one-twenty so you could put more in
there and if you buy it you probably
should I don't know why I mean I know
why they're not shipping with better
fans or more fans it's because they're
trying to hit a certain price point but
I mean I see better fans in there
and ideally maybe to one of the front on
the back anyways supports three sixty
millimeter radiators at the top and the
front and it ships with built-in dust
filters no word on pricing or
availability but the targeting low ish
given the feature set and we've been
including the hardware sales at the end
of these episodes for the last couple
weeks currently on sale there's a sea
Sonic 620 watt power supply it's been
around for a while now but there's a
reason it's been a while around for a
while it's really a decent power supply
currently $30 on Amazon the u.s. anyway
we would recommend it and then there are
still some rise in CPU sales the kind of
spotty compared to previously given the
headquarter one 2018 is gonna have rise
and Plus kind of makes sense that
they're going on sales so much we don't
know what risin plus is gonna look like
for performance that said it's hard to
feel bad about buying something like a
1700 for $270 or a 1600 2x or 1600 for
180 $190 really not it's not a bad deal
so even if something new is around the
corner if you need something today now
or for the holidays or something like
that it's a good pickup Intel sales have
mostly ended it looks like the 7700 K
isn't no longer marked down however
tigerdirect did screw up temporarily
Atlas hit an 8700 K for $60 six zero I
don't think they're fulfilling those
orders and finally there are lots of
monitors that continue to go on display
go on display go on sale but the
displays timeout within like a day late
leaves no point including them now but I
will link one in the description along
with links to everything else that's on
sale when we post the video so you can
check that if you want to see what
monitor we like that's out so that's all
for this one as always you can subscribe
for more you go to patreon.com/scishow
stop that directly we have a new $5 tier
where we will be posting behind the
scenes videos about two to four times a
month
like to check those out or you just
subscribe for more we're gonna store it
I guarantee excess net / mod Matt -
check out our new modding Matt I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
