warfare and torn banner previously
worked on chivalry medieval warfare and
before that age of chivalry and Mirage
is a take on a similar idea but with all
magic so that makes it unique in some
ways still multiplayer game still got
the nitty gritty meaty battle and all of
that but before getting to this content
and our hands-on impressions all of this
coverage from pack sees 2016 is brought
to you by CyberPower who made the fain
book that we recently overclocked past 4
gigahertz so Mirage arcane warfare we
had a couple minutes on it for hands-on
and the trouble with this title is that
it's not quite like something maybe like
Call of Duty which is more twitchy and
you can kind of pick up and instantly
are familiar with just by nature of
knowing the game series so it's pretty
tough to get a good hands-on impression
while on a show floor but we got some
decent thoughts together between the two
of us playing it and at the core of
Mirage it's all about telegraphing
attacks so it's this idea that if I'm
doing attack against you of some kind
you should be able to through skill and
experience in the game look at me and
judge what type of attack I'm doing how
long it will take to be a threat to you
and things like that and that comes
through pretty well in gameplay even
within a few minutes on the show floor
so that is something you pick up pretty
early now acting on that definitely
takes a bit of time and acquired skill
so that gives the game more of a skill
ceilings got some room to grow and that
also feeds into this steep learning
curve so it's not something you pick up
immediately as I said not like a call of
duty game so takes a bit to pick up now
in terms of the core mechanics the map
design was pretty well done we liked how
is very almost team fortress 2 like in
how obvious it was to go to one
objective or the other it's very easy to
follow the information conveyance was
good and all of that seemed to be in a
pretty good place for the initial builds
of the game so for combat that's where
the meat of the game is it's really just
a multiplayer combat game sort of a
first-person slasher not really a single
player game at all and you've got a few
main attack so left click is your
primary attack right click is a block
and that will be used frequently but for
variations on the primary
you can sort of drag the mouse left or
right and that'll give you an arc and
that's just like in chivalry medieval
warfare you drag your left sewing that
way and if you drag it right right at
the end of that arc it'll go the other
way and stop starts combo in attacks and
is really where the skill comes in for
the game but there's not a lot of melee
in Mirage arcane warfare as the name
might suggest it's more about our K and
warfare so the spells got three spells
in your hotbar and those change based on
the class and there is progression where
you can unlock different spells as you
play and sort of somewhat advanced your
character in a persistent fashion a lot
of these characters have a spell that is
a teleport to allow them to escape from
dangerous situations pretty quickly or
jump into them in the case of one of the
brutes and the rest of them have a mix
of range spells they have traps they can
play bombs on the ground that are useful
as sort of proximity mines and there's a
hook shot which reminds us of one of the
overwatch characters where you can pull
an enemy and towards you and all of
these work pretty well the it's it's
really tough to say the balance because
we just didn't have enough time to talk
about balance but in terms of the feel
everything feels about right the only
real downsides to speak of really
immediately anyway is the learning curve
so it takes a bit of time to get used to
and this isn't a downside so much as
just a general observation but it is a
slower paced game so if you don't like
those this is maybe about the speed of
counter-strike as opposed to call of
duty then you would want to stay away
from mirage but overall we liked the
game the mechanics felt fairly fluid an
intuitive after a little bit of time
playing it and would definitely progress
to a pretty high skilled play there is a
match making mode which will help keep
you in the right group for your skill
level based upon your performance in
matches and at the end of the day the
game is basically just chivalry medieval
warfare with magic so if you're familiar
with that game already on like it you'll
probably like this one it's just more
range and got some more high fantasy
setting elements to it so check out
links in the description below for more
information as always postural video
will take you to the other coverage from
pax east 2016 or a patreon page thank
you for watching I'll see you all next
