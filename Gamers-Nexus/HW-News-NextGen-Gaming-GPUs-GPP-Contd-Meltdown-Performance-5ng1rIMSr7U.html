the end of it at this point and we're
doing a recap for news for the past ten
days or so there's been some stuff here
I'll be talking about stuff we saw at
the conference
Jensen's keynote which was about three
hours long and entirely a hunter ai and
deep learning automation things like
that and I also be talking about a
couple of other news items for the past
week CTS labs once again we have an
update there we have some news on
meltdown and Specter that we got here at
the conference actually some pretty cool
stuff in terms of performance
information and high performance
applications and then a couple of other
minor news items for the past week this
video is brought to you by the gamers
Nexus anti-static mod mat our mod mat
uses a high quality anti-static surface
with a rubberized finish we also have a
custom paint job on it which includes
reference points and cheat sheets for
PCIe eps 12 volt and other power cables
along with quick reference thermal paste
application guides a screw sorter for
your video card tear downs and it
includes a common ground point and a
grounding strap to help protect the
products you are working on from
electrostatic discharge order your mat
now at the link in the description below
so first news item than the keynote at
GTCC the graphics technology or GPU
technology conference historically there
have been a couple of launches here for
GPUs the Titan X was one of them nothing
here this time we did get some valuable
information though we had a video where
we spoke with SK Hynix about G DDR 6 and
its inclusion on future NVIDIA GPUs a
couple of things I wanted to go over now
that we didn't talk about Foley in that
video for one if you haven't seen that
video go watch it but basically the the
point we're getting across is GG dr6
is expected for mass production from
hynek's in about three months so that
would be June July timeframe and Samsung
has already been in mass production for
GG dr6 so they've been on the way our
understanding presently is that hynek's
is supposed to be one of the launch
partners for the new and video GPUs if
that's accurate what we've been told is
accurate then it would be reasonable to
assume short of trickling out GG dr6
that Nvidia's next major gaming consumer
GPU launch won't be for at least
three months since that's when mass
production starts on the hynek's g6
memory but again lots of things are
considered there one is if they've been
trickling out memory for the last few
months then they could still have
launched product even if it's not mass
production
the other one is Samsung it's in the
game too so if they're the major launch
vendor things could still happen sooner
than it greater than or equal to three
months from now that said NVIDIA has in
the past launched gaming grade GPUs in
the September to October window and if
history repeats itself that seems like
it would be reasonable to happen again
they're not under a lot of pressure from
AMD right now they're not under a lot of
pressure from their own architecture
right now because they're still selling
through Pascal partly thanks to crypto
partly thanks to demand in general and
that said I've received a lot of emails
from you all in the past week about the
lack of a pre-order button on Nvidia's
website where they've removed it and
just said that the cards are out of
stock now as opposed to enabling you to
preorder the cards for the next round so
the fact that that's going away as many
of you have indicated is potentially the
start of the end for some of the Pascal
cards that they might be winding down in
production if they won't be selling them
directly that could also just be
completely unrelated in coincidental but
either way from the GDR six-story it
looks like we're at least three months
out assuming hynek's is in fact a launch
partner and assuming that informations
correct
so we're looking at a little while for
consumer grade GPUs if you haven't seen
the keynote if you save you some time if
you are not interested in deep learning
machine learning machine intelligence AI
autonomous vehicles anything like that
don't bother the keynote will not
interest you if you're interested in
those things then at a top level you've
got a recap if you're beyond top level
you need more than it will not interest
you so a couple other things we saw here
at the conference one was a quick AI for
locomotion and animation talk that we
went to it's pretty interesting
basically talking about the usage of AI
routines to allow pathfinding in
animations and models and games as
characters NVC or PC
navigate their way through complex
terrain so we have some clips of that
some of its kind of funny
but basically they create a reward
system so the AI as its training is
rewarded with something something good
from the system from the program if it's
able to balance correctly navigate
terrain correctly etc if it falls down
it does not get that reward so it's
basically a deep learning version or a
machine learning version to get AI to
train itself how to navigate terrain but
whether that can be used completely
independently from actors or whether
there's a use case outside of a crowd
simulation for example remains to be
seen for crowd simulation makes a lot of
sense because there's some physics
there's some physical interactions there
think of assassin's creed for example
push your way through a crowd maybe some
NPC characters lose balance or maybe
they they step in a specific way in
relation to how you are moving through
them not something you really want for a
hero character you don't want the hero
character randomly falling over because
they lose balance but for a crowd
simulation it makes a lot of sense so
that's something we saw here we also
talked or saw a talk about meltdown
inspector that was given from somebody
at Red Hat and Red Hat's local to us
back home so we'll try and talk with
them about this in greater detail but of
interest to you all the primary impact
from meltdown inspector from this talk
was largely going to be on database and
from the standpoint of database the
impact is mostly looking at 7 to 20
percent hit performance it for disk
intensive i/o intensive and database
applications whereas more consumer
facing applications as we've seen in the
past should expect a much smaller
performance hit from meltdown inspector
mitigation updates whether that software
firmware mostly microcode and firmware
at this point so it's kind of good news
for consumer face and stuff bad news for
anyone who does a lot of work with
databases we're gonna try and talk with
red hat and follow up more on that get
some one-on-one time for a future
interview but that's what we got for now
basically impact is looking at 7 to 20
percent for database and that range
shrinks if you're using ret pulling
verse
is IBRS which i believe are some of the
patches they were talking about or
mitigation techniques with rat pulling
being a lot less and IBRS being a bit
more 12 to 20 percent performance it
next one so outside of those we also I
guess just recap II here look for major
GPUs nothing at the show sorry
we did get some good information that
while here from Nvidia employees from SK
Hynix from others and we have an
interview going up with Tom Peterson of
Nvidia about ray tracing and that'll be
soon so check back for that additionally
there's some msi gigabyte stuff in the
last week we know we saw it we've been
trying to loop back with these companies
and others to figure out exactly what's
going on in the GP p space if you missed
the news msi had a giant missed F and
gaff and one of the MSI India Facebook
page Managers for for the MSI India page
sort of stepped out of line and made
some comments that looked pretty bad
basically picking favorites of Nvidia so
MSI's apologize for that they've deleted
those comments but that hasn't stopped
people from noticing the fact that
there's a plane going over my head but
that hasn't stopped people from noticing
the fact that MSI's product pages have
had limited rx series gaming and branded
offerings because of the current GPP
climate I think there's been a lot of
speculation that it could be related to
GPP we don't have any concrete evidence
of that I have spoken with MSI I'm
having a hard time getting anywhere and
it's pretty frustrating but the good
news is I do have a couple of contact
leads of where I can get some proper
information because my main contacts
have failed me there but what I can tell
you this is this from speaking with
people here mostly off-the-record the
gigabyte product the gaming box the
external GPU for am DS RX series cards
as I understand it for since it's been
in production has been planned to not
have the word on the box there are to
take so takeaways here
one takeaway is that
okay maybe they genuinely never planned
to have the gaming branding on that
external GPU enclosure for AMD that's
possible if it's been in production that
way for the last year it is one of the
feasible outcomes the other is that
perhaps if we are taking the GPP
conspiracy side which may not be a
conspiracy we need to find out still but
if you're taking outside then if gbv has
been in place for the past year maybe
they just started planning very early on
that and it's been in effect longer than
we think I'll have more information for
you soon on on all of that at some point
still talking to a lot of people it's a
really slow process the fact that this
has been in the news now for a little
while means that some companies have
tightened down on talking about it some
people don't want to talk about it or
genuinely know nothing about it and so
it's going to take me some time to work
through contacts in the industry and
figure out is GPP legitimately as large
of an issue as it has been made to
appear at this point or it or not and I
don't know I don't have an answer but
I've been talking to people and I'm
working on it so give me time give
everyone else time at this point that's
what it's gonna take
because the story is out there so it
just takes a while to talk to everyone
collect enough feedback that we feel
confident in presenting some kind of
outcome either way though gigabyte box
as I understand it has been planned
without the aorist branding for quite
some time now that does not mean GPP
didn't influence it but it's something
it's a data point to consider in that
storyline MSI doesn't have an answer for
me on why rx gaming stuff is lacking
from the product pages but they've
basically said we don't think we've had
any gaming products in stock for a long
time the rx 500 series so maybe that's
why I don't know but I have a contact
now so I'm gonna look further into that
outside of GBP and NVIDIA all sort of 4k
144 Hertz displays will be arriving in
April these were shown quite some time
ago at least a year ago now never made
it to market but now they finally will
be so Nvidia is expecting the arrival of
the 4k 144 Hertz g-sync displays their
HDR displays that they've shown
previously by the end of quarter one for
their fiscal year
videos q1 ends April 29th 2018 so we can
infer that Nvidia believes the new
displays will ship in April at CES last
year a strand issues both had prototypes
based on a reference designed by Nvidia
since that time they've been able to
expand on that and customize them and
the promised 2017 release window was
delayed for unknown reasons but they're
coming out eventually
Acer's predator X 27 and asus rog swift
PG 27 UQ are both based on the reference
design and were based on an au Optronics
panel which specifically if you're
curious is the m270 QA n 0 to 2 a hva
panel next one 3d mark direct x ray
tracing demo this will be a short one
for you
future mark is launching a new direct
tax rate racing demonstration that
includes it non screen space reflections
so quick primer here if I'm the camera
in the game that's my screen space and
everything behind me is outside of
screen space so if we have a shiny
object in front of me like a mirror
facing my camera perspective there's an
object behind me that is outside of
screen space and we have a reflection of
the object in the shiny object in front
of me then those would be non screen
space reflections so 3d marks working on
some ray tracing stuff including some
advanced reflections and these should
run on things outside of just Volta
unlike the RT X features that we've been
told about and they will be using
Microsoft DirectX 12 ray tracing feature
set expect that by end of year also in
the news and these Radeon Ray's this was
announced around the same time and GP
profiler 1.2 which is actually a pretty
cool application so Radeon Rays is AMD's
Vulcan based ray tracing engine and
Radeon Rays will use asynchronous
compute in conjunction with AMD silicon
GPU CVS ApS etc to create real time ray
tracing capabilities the engine is open
source and it conforms to the opencl 1.2
standard so it can be deployed with non
AMD hardware across multiple OS
environments and also announced was a
new version of there are GP Radian
graphics profiler and that will offer
compatibility with rendered
interestingly improves frame and
graphics debugging and detailed barrier
codes and improves frame overviews this
is a pretty useful application if you're
a developer and can make use of
something like that
next one Corsair h-60 refresh really
short on this course there's got a
couple of new product lines in the a i/o
or CLC market and the h-60 is coming out
or out already for 2018 has a new
mounting bracket design upgraded fan and
a redesigned pump block and radiator and
the new look is identical to the recent
h1 50 I and H 150 I Pro coolers but NICs
is the RGB lighting in favor of static
white backlight last two here power
colors got a new red dragon rx Vega 56
and no one's gonna be able to buy it so
actually it might be available I don't
know but Vega has been pretty hard to
come by also sort of all GPUs either way
the red dragon version is not that
different from Vega 56 in general it's
got a different cooler it didn't
disclose pricing that announcement and
amidst the inflated GPU market that's
kind of irrelevant to anyway but
currently the new egg and eBay store
list third party retailer lists or $800
so don't buy it but if it comes down
maybe it'll be worth it Andy and our CTS
labs updates last one here since last
time AMD has publicly addressed the
findings of CTS labs and has announced
plans to mitigate the vulnerabilities a
week or two ago CTS labs disclosed an
alleged 13 security vulnerabilities for
Rison epic so forth and am these
chipsets even and alongside those
findings crazy people Viceroy research
published a 30 page raving report
brazenly declaring the expiry of AMD as
stock saying that it should be 0.00
dollars so if you missed that stuff go
check it out it was a vitriolic insane
diatribe of a lunatic but either way
Viceroy pretty much discredited most of
the stuff just on the basis of looking
insane as far as actual security
vulnerabilities we did talk about in our
initial coverage and some people seem to
forget this that the vulnerabilities
themselves seem to be valid we talked to
security experts who disk
and Advanced Research of meltdown
inspector and they all told us at the
beginning of this whole saga when we
initially reported on it that the
researchers of meltdown inspector
thought the bugs the exploits to be
legitimate but their concerns were
basically in the presentation of those
exploits just like those were our
concerns we still have a lot of concerns
with that it seems awfully odd and maybe
financially motivated though that's hard
to prove one way or the other
either way AMD did address the report
and in the report they basically
acknowledged that the security flaws to
some extent exist giving a small amount
of credibility to CTS labs and AMD kept
it to the point they basically said the
following exploitation requires
administrative access of which once
acquired many more attacks not listed by
CTS could be perpetrated the security
threats are not related to the AMD Xen
architecture but firmware and chipsets
associated with some a m4 in tr4 sockets
and these planned mitigation is in the
form of firmware and BIOS updates from
OMS no performance impact is expected so
basically although you don't need
physical Hardware access you need root
level access administrator access to the
entire system
once you have root level access to the
system you do whatever you want
so I think and these address of these
issues is kind of like brushing them off
to the side although they do acknowledge
that they're real but the fact remains
that cts Labs presentation was awful and
it really looked like a hit job so maybe
improve on that in the future CTS labs
if you'd like to retain credibility
either way that's it for the nature last
two weeks check back for more as always
