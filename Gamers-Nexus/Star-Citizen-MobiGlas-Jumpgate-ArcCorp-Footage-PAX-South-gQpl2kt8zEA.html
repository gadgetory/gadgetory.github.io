nexus donna and today we're looking at
some new star citizen footage that was
spotted at the PAX south Town Hall last
night first of all there's already an
interview with chris Roberts online we
put that on our YouTube channel last
night where he talked about the
persistent universe module and the next
plans for star citizen along with a
loose timeline for what you can expect
in terms of releases so what we're
looking at today is all footage of the
Jumpgate the moby glass and interface
actions of star citizen and a couple of
other side things like shops and
planetside type modules and this was all
shown at the town hall and it's written
about in the article like the
description below first of all the jump
gate was one of the most interesting in
this footage you can see the ship
navigating through a wormhole and this
is actually a player action it's not
just going to be rendered cinematically
in the game so players will actively
navigate through wormholes when they
initiate a jump gate to move from one
system to the other and the way this is
done is just by normal flight control
except you're trying to avoid hitting
the walls of the wormhole which cause
we're not sure yet but it could be
destruction or it could be falling out
of warp or something like that to do
that effect aside from this we also saw
the mobi glass and user interface design
for shopping and planetside engagement
and social engagement with other players
friends list things like that the
interface is opened on the players arm
it launches up in front of them and it
can actually be seen modeled by other
players and passers-by who are who are
in the area so what you do is you either
access the center face in your Hannah or
really wherever you want you can look at
player outfits and friends lists and
what friends are in the area and maps
system maps things like that it also is
used when you're in shops on the
planetside module which is coming out
sooner rather than later and this will
be done on the Arctic or planet first
and foremost and then later on the other
planets on art Corp there's a shop
called cubby blast where you can look at
different weapons and explosives and fun
stuff like that this user interfaces
opened up on your arm when you're ready
to buy something and you just navigate
through it so it looks
sort of like an augmented reality
interface and it's it's nothing that
different from a normal menu system it
just looks different it's not you hit
escape and then you navigate to the
menus it's you open it on your arm so
it's a little more immersive but it
still behaves and functions and serves
the same purpose as a menu so that is
all the footage from star citizen that
we are presently allowed to show check
out the channel for more information and
subscribe because there will be more
shortly I will see you all next time
