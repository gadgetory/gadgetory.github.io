have tested more than 100 configurations
across our benchmark suite we've seen
some brilliant cases that have been
marred by needless grasps at buzzwords
excellently designed enclosures that no
one talks about and poorly designed
cases that everyone talks about cases as
a whole have gone through a lot of
transformations this year which would
seem somewhat surprising given that
you'd think there are really only so
many ways to make a box today we're
giving out awards for the best cases in
categories of thermals silence design
overall quality and more before that
this video is brought to you by thermal
grizzly makers of the conductor hot
liquid metal that we recently used to
drop 20 degrees off of our coffee leak
temperatures thermal grizzly also makes
traditional thermal compounds we use on
top of the IHS like cryo not and hydro
not pastes learn more at the link below
so this is basically an end of your
awards show for cases we have a few of
these coming up and for this we are
focusing strictly and entirely on cases
we've reviewed in the last year so
before anyone's like but where's my case
it's because we didn't review it
probably and we have all the individual
reviews on the site and on the channel
for these cases if you are interested
we'll have links to the cases in the
description below if you want any of
them and then we'll have a link to the
review for each one of those the first
award is for best out-of-the-box
thermals contrary to the name of the
award title we don't actually just point
an IR gun at the case when it has
literally just come out of the box No
this award is for best thermal
performance in a stock configuration
meaning no added fans or removed panels
we reviewed the silverstone redlined
0-6 pro back in May and for the past six
months now the RL 0-6 Pro has remained
fully uncontested in its top position on
the charts the case is being kept around
for a standard in our benchmark suite as
its thermal performance is second to
none in its stock state with what we've
tested this year this performance is a
combination of silver stones at triple
fan intake thin metal mesh front panel
and mid tower layout the mid tower
layout keeps everything close to the
fans and exhaust but the front mesh is
where the case pulls ahead other mesh
panels and case
with mesh have tried and failed to
outmatch the are l06 this year and
that's largely because the red line uses
a mesh that's not overly dense in its
creation the red lines euro-6 maintained
a 47.8 degree cpu temperature and our CV
torture test planting it firmly ahead of
everything else the next closest case
stock was the Corsair 570 X so honorable
mentioned there with its three 1500 rpm
fans the silverstone our l06 pro only
gets beaten when we start adding $20
fans to the metro phi which of course
would also be outdone by the red line if
we replace its fans with $20 units GPU
temperatures have remained fully
chart-topping in our torture tests as
well with a forty seven point one degree
readout in the torture workload the next
closest was the thermal take view 71 at
forty eight point seven the case offers
no frills and focuses entirely on air
flow it's also $70 and it's noise levels
are decidedly unimpressive but not
insultingly loud either honorable
mentions go to the throne will take view
71 for GPU thermals when it's
horizontally mounted and that's a case
that surprised us and it's neural
performance overall another honorable
mention goes to the corsair 570 extra
stock cpu thermals but the 5 so DX
really just achieves it by brute force
with a lot of high-speed fans in the
front panel in contrast to best thermals
we now look for best silence the be
quiet pure bass 600 coming from an aptly
named company has maintained a set of
high ranking and top ranking results for
the silence benchmarks at low rpms which
would primarily be used for idle or low
load operation the pure bass 600
measured at 29 DBA for full system noise
the top result our noise floor is about
26 DBA so this is only barely audible
over room ambient at these rpms of
course thermal performance isn't great
so you might flip the switch to go up to
max RPMs for gain performance during
these higher load scenarios the pure
bass 600 maintains 8 33.7 DBA knows
level and the minimum fan RPMs give us
absolute silence for the most part which
allow us better noise levels during idle
operation we'll give an honorable
mention to the BitFenix Shogun at 1000
rpm this case is high
polarizing in its design but as overall
sturdy construction quality with
moderate performance it's not for
everyone but worth considering the next
award is for best overall design this
award it looks strictly at the
construction quality layout and design
of the case and its panels this award
goes to the NZXT H 700 I the age 700 I
took a bit of a beating for it's coupled
smart device which raised price
unnecessarily wasn't fully intuitive and
barely worked and that can easily
overshadow the case itself we asked in
our review for an H 700 D D for dumb
because the case is brilliant in all of
its aspects except for the smart device
panel construction quality is top class
avoiding plastics nearly everywhere and
the panels are both easily removed and
securely fastened and the XTS designer
made artistic use of ventilation holes
to pattern the entire case top to bottom
inside out with a metal ventilation mesh
in the top panel front panel and atop
the power supply shroud this is both
functional and good-looking cable
management makes use of mounted routing
channels making rivers of cables along
the backside of the case and the eject
button on the rear panel makes for the
most easily secured and removed side
panel that we've worked with this year
and the XE is a build quality and ease
of installation features our top class
with the H 700 I and although the case
is marred by its smart device which
worsens the value proposition it is
otherwise well designed if NZXT makes a
dumb version of the H 700 I in the 120
to 150 dollar price range it'd be a
go-to choice for sure for now we give
the chassis itself the best overall
design award for 2017 our next award is
for best full Tower and focuses on
looking at our reviewed list of cases
for the overall feature set and
performance that you'd want in a large
case this one goes to the be quiet dark
Bass Pro 900 enclosure with a very close
honourable mention to the likes of the
view 71 we first reviewed the be quiet
dark based pro 900 this year with the
white edition of the case the enclosure
has a fully invertible motherboard
layout but does it in a way that doesn't
ruin the rest of the cases quality the
enclosure uses thick paneling and glass
to trap
lower-frequency hums which can only
reasonably be contained with that
thicker paneling and a larger chassis it
secondarily uses foam damping for higher
frequency noises like coil whine and the
dark bass pro 900 has a few unnecessary
frills to it like the Chi charter that
we don't really find necessary or that
useful but its construction quality
takes the win for full tower categories
a mix of reasonable airflow and lower
noise outputs although not chart-topping
for either aids the dark bass pro 900 in
its winning for this category again the
view 71 isn't really as full of a full
tower has the DVP 900 but it's worth
looking at as is the c 700 p which is
just a very specific case depending on
your use cases but the c 700 p is
another large one that we looked at this
year our next award is for best
presentation of the pc where the case is
more of a showcase than anything else
this one goes to the Thermaltake Corp
III it's less of an enclosure and more
of a set of guidelines to mount the
components to if they're on take Corp
III II can be wall-mounted configure it
as a flat test bench or stood up
normally the case is basically a large
steel box inside of which are where the
cables hide and it's accompanied with
liquid cooling mounts vertical GPU
support and component arrangement that
focuses on showing off ion PC this is an
example where trends our next topic can
be put to actual use because the case is
best suited for liquid cooling
configurations and showroom style setups
the open air presentation works the
vertical GPU mount is distanced enough
that it doesn't trap thermals too much
and the case even works fine for air
cooling of course it's not great if you
have pets for example but a wall mount
mostly fixes that best all-around goes
to the fractal mesh if I see a case that
we ended up buying for review following
its popularity the metro facie is a
remake of the define C which we already
liked but had called warm in our review
although the mesh light doesn't do much
to resolve this in its stock
configuration the case ascends the
charts rapidly landing toward or at the
top once adding fans to the front the
open mesh front has a unique look but
also accommodates additional fans
exceptionally well pushing all that air
straight into the nearby components we
already praised
the define c4 it's cable management ease
of installation process and overall
build quality and an intentionally
subdued design and the Metro fire is an
extension of all these things but with
better air flow for additional fans what
puts the case into the best all-around
category though is its affordability the
measure V is $80 presently making it one
of the most affordable cases on this
list that also implements reasonable
airflow with its more strategic use of
tempered glass and industry trends
the next award goes to the dumbest trend
the dumbest trend goes to form over
function which includes things like
excessive and needless use of tempered
glass RGB LEDs in every corner and
crevice a lack of USB type-c support
closed off front panels with zero
ventilation and raised GPU clocks as a
result and the industry is desire to
throw every single fad at a box without
thinking about why they're doing it
vertical GPUs are a good example they
can be pretty cool but they often
incinerate against the side panel of a
case each of these trends has its place
in an enclosure but a line must be drawn
when it's clear that a manufacturer is
just gluing panels and LED strips to a
case while hacksaw in out a vertical GPU
mount in a case that's clearly not built
for it followed up by sticking a 1980s
cartoon robot front panel onto the
enclosure oh and not to mention that
tempered glass panels that are painted
black and stuck on the cable side of the
case are kinda silly too so that rounds
out our case awards for the year the
next look at cases will be more of a a
very specific focused look at one aspect
of cases coming up soon this panels
kind of chipped and broken actually came
like that
speaking of trends though yeah trends
overall for the case industry very
clearly form over function for this year
it's probably gonna continue a bit for
next year but we'll have a separate
piece that talks about trends for the
industry as a whole
closer to CES which is coming up in
January and of course as always plenty
of other content between now and then so
