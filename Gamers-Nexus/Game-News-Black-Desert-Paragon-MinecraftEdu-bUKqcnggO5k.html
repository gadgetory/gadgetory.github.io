evil than good at this point early

is back in the news it's been a while
now since the blocky game dominated the

billion dollar acquisition of Mo Jane

at least temporarily this week
Microsoft's fronted its initial plan for
the investment and it's called minecraft
education edition Microsoft's recognized
that minecraft connects with kids in a
fashion that is often educational
leading mo Jane to acquire the Finnish
mod minecraft edu for further
development microsoft aims to monetize
education edition at the enterprise
level selling directly to schools and
instructors as a means to engage
students more actively minecraft
education Edition will be free through
the summer and on limited trial license
but will require full license purchases

Epic Games mysterious new game has
finally received some information of
substance the first teasers didn't even
tell us what genre the game would be any
thing of its gameplay or anything other
than the name which is Paragon by the
way since then we've learned that
Paragon is a MOBA with a new element of
verticality switching up gameplay
mechanics from the standard top-down
arena format in a substantial way a new
trailer emerge for Paragon last week
entitled mid lane push when we see the
high fidelity heroes engage in routine
Lane combat the game's most profound
statement is made simply in its graphics
propagated by the use of Unreal Engine 4
and will make Paragon one of the most
visually intense mobiles to date if not
the most visually intense MOBA to date
some limited gameplay and encounters can
be seen with most of epic cinematic
efforts focusing our eyes toward the
vertical positioning of characters we're
still waiting for more information to
emerge but it's already known that
Paragon is presently in alpha and that
the game is targeting a release sometime
