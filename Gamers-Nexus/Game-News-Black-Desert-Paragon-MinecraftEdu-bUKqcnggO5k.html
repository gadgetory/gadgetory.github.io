dotnet and this is your weekly game news
recap black desert Online has the most
in-depth character creator ever made for
a game from what we've seen and that's a
fact that's probably been used for more
evil than good at this point early
adopters of black deserts freshly
released free MMO character creator have
modeled some of the most genuinely
hideous characters we've ever seen from
the hilariously grotesque to physically
improbable the toolkit is fully capable
of graphically stunning rule-breaking
creations black desert online is the
korean mo that you've probably all heard
of at this point at least in passing but
it's finally nearing completion
developers pearl abyss are working with
publisher down games to leverage the
games early attention offering up the
character creator for free download to
start more interest the game's release
date is vaguely set for the first
quarter of 2016 but we've already been
given our first quest and that's in the
form of downs Beauty and the Beast
contest using the BDO character creator
players are tasked with submitting the
most out-of-this-world creations they
can fathom to the black desert forums
everyone gets a participation prize and
a few top winners get extras minecraft
is back in the news it's been a while
now since the blocky game dominated the
news cycle I think our last major story
was probably about Microsoft's two
billion dollar acquisition of Mo Jane
and notches departure from the industry
at least temporarily this week
Microsoft's fronted its initial plan for
the investment and it's called minecraft
education edition Microsoft's recognized
that minecraft connects with kids in a
fashion that is often educational
leading mo Jane to acquire the Finnish
mod minecraft edu for further
development microsoft aims to monetize
education edition at the enterprise
level selling directly to schools and
instructors as a means to engage
students more actively minecraft
education Edition will be free through
the summer and on limited trial license
but will require full license purchases
after that if you're an educator you can
learn more at education minecraft net
Epic Games mysterious new game has
finally received some information of
substance the first teasers didn't even
tell us what genre the game would be any
thing of its gameplay or anything other
than the name which is Paragon by the
way since then we've learned that
Paragon is a MOBA with a new element of
verticality switching up gameplay
mechanics from the standard top-down
arena format in a substantial way a new
trailer emerge for Paragon last week
entitled mid lane push when we see the
high fidelity heroes engage in routine
Lane combat the game's most profound
statement is made simply in its graphics
propagated by the use of Unreal Engine 4
and will make Paragon one of the most
visually intense mobiles to date if not
the most visually intense MOBA to date
some limited gameplay and encounters can
be seen with most of epic cinematic
efforts focusing our eyes toward the
vertical positioning of characters we're
still waiting for more information to
emerge but it's already known that
Paragon is presently in alpha and that
the game is targeting a release sometime
early in 2016 our next story relates to
oculus rift founder Palmer Luckey who's
been embroiled in legal battles with
Total Recall technologies and has been
accused by Xenia max of stealing trade
secrets on the 16th it was ruled that
the Total Recall lawsuit against lucky
could proceed though a judge did dismiss
several additional claims against lucky
the part of the lawsuit which has been
permitted to continue relates to a
breach of contract with Total Recall
technologies who allege that oculus
founder Palmer Luckey broke his
contractual agreement by allegedly using
trade secrets to develop his Kickstarter
for oculus in response to this lucky
stated that the Total Recall lawsuit is
quote a brazen attempt to secure for
itself a stake in oculus vr s recent
multi-billion dollar acquisition by
Facebook the case will continue in the
Northern District of California finally
humble bundles winter sales have
continued into January unlike steams
winter sale the humble store is rotating
deals in and out every three days
offering a build-your-own bundle option
for users there's also a humble Firaxis

meier's pirates civilization 3 and ace
patrol all for one dollar civ four and
