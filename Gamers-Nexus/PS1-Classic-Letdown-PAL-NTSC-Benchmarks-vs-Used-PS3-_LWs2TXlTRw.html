seeing T is now and it brings some
competition to the space of console
benchmarking using gnz rebuilt console
testing software we're benchmarking the
PSone classics at frame time consistency
and gameplay quality today particularly
against the backwards compatible ps3
play of the same games the PlayStation
Classic is a mini console using a modern
arm 1.5 gigahertz quad-core CPU and a
pre-loaded selection of 20 games that
are about two decades old the price of
this combination including two
controllers and no power adapter is $100
it's a product targeted at collectors
and that nostalgic once owners of the
ps1 to collectors go for it I guess but
for people who just want to play
original ps1 games again another option
exists and that option is a $15.00 used
ps3 and backwards compatibility that's
what we're benchmarking today before
that this video is brought to you by the
EVGA CLC 280 liquid cooler people ask me
how I keep cool during the summer with
all this hair well I've tried a lot of
different products and few do exactly
what I need many of them cause tangles
or worse EVGA CLC 280 helps keep my core
temperatures low they're in hot
benchmarking sessions the CLC 280 is
price competitive and focuses on
performance for value offering a 280
liquid cooler at an affordable price get
yours at the link in the description
below hair mounting kit sold separately
we already have a teardown of the ps1
classic on the channel if you want to
check it out and see what the hardware
is inside of this thing it's very small
but it's playing games that are about 24
years old so form factor isn't much of a
problem because the components inside of
it are more or less mobile components
now as for alternatives this isn't the
only way of course to play ps1 games the
ps1 classic itself uses an emulator an
open-source one and you can get that
emulator if you wanted to so this isn't
the only way to do it but another
legitimate way to play old ps1 games
would be basically any PlayStation
console ps2 ps3 for example used for a
lower price than you could get this so
have you get the PS
we used about 15 $20 something like that
depending where you are and it too can
play ps1 games so we just need to look
at which one is the better solution if
all you care about is playing those
games and as close to the original
experience as you can get because even
though this looks like a smaller version
of the ps1 it is a very distant from the
original experience as is the ps3
emulating both are emulating so if you
really wanted the original experience
you have to buy the original console but
no one wants to do that so we're gonna
see how close you can get with these two
devices and also here we're doing
testing with a new frame time overlay
approach for console games who knows
maybe we'll use the software in the
future but this is important to go over
so if you're not familiar with our
previous frame time testing for consoles
we've advanced it significantly since
the last time we did this there's
another issue that's especially relevant
to the PlayStation Classic games with
frame times that spike up and down at
regular intervals can appear to have a
constant FPS when averaged there are 50
Hertz games included on the 60 Hertz
classic which must therefore output
frames at different intervals to run at
the correct speed for example running on
the PlayStation classic which outputs
frames every sixteen point six seven
milliseconds 60 fps an NTSC game with
constant frame times of 50 milliseconds
or 20 FPS would display as a AAA BBB CCC
and those are frames that are new versus
repeat frames while its powell
counterpart p al with constant frame
times of 60 milliseconds sixteen point
six seven FPS would be something more
along the lines of a AAA BBB CC CC DD d
ee ee ffff and so forth because 50 is a
clean multiple of sixteen point seven
and sixty is not however depending on
the size of the sample window the game
could appear to run at a constant and
smooth frame rate on both platforms as
opposed to frame times which are spiking
all over the place
NTSC and PAL are technically standards
for color encodings but they've become
synonymous with a refresh rates which
are generally 60 Hertz for mts
North American and 50 Hertz for PAL it's
not much of an issue anymore but
historically has caused problems with
porting games since the easiest way to
convert NTSC developed games for release
in PAL regions was to just slow them
down so in the past developers have just
slowed them down to 5/6 the speed
because it's 50 Hertz versus 60 Hertz
and of course again there are other
differences there too but much of the
criticism around the PlayStation Classic
has revolved around Sony's decision to
include the slowed down and inferior PAL
version of some games so that's one of
the things we can be looking at here
today with the developer mode enabled
for some CPU load metrics as well here's
a quick tutorial on the interface at the
bottom you'll see a frame time plot that
has a playhead centrally at 0 seconds
with plus 1 and minus 1 second
indicators on either side the line graph
is a frame time metric presented in
increments of sixteen point seven
milliseconds as we're working with a 60
FPS capture and a console that outputs
60fps ideally the frame times are
perfectly flat and consistent that would
be a good experience and for perspective
16.7 will be 60 FPS 33 is 30 the
reported values it must cleanly be
divisible by 16 point 7 milliseconds as
that is the maximum baseline capture
speed the top left of the interface
shows the frame time of the frame
currently being displayed if you ever
see this jump significantly it is likely
that you will also notice a stutter in
gameplay that's all we're doing for now
we'll expand more on this later but
let's start testing with GTA then Ridge
Racer and then Syphon Filter with GTA K
and play testing on the ps1 classic we
see that the frame time plot bounces
rapidly between 50 milliseconds and 60
point seven millisecond deliveries for
perspective 60 FPS would be sixteen
point six 67 milliseconds constantly
with no deviation from that output in
this output at sixty six point seven
milliseconds we're getting a new in-game
frame for every four frames of video
playback meaning that we get three
repeated frames for every new frame in a
traditional GPU this would mean that the
front buffer and back buffer haven't
flipped yet and the frame is still being
polled and represented because that no
new frame is yet ready to be presented
we define this as a stutter every now
and then GTA on the ps1 classic and
counters massive spikes 283 milliseconds
it would be easy to put these in FPS
because that number it looks atrocious
but it would kind of be disingenuous
because to distill this into fps means
that it would average out between 67
milliseconds 50 millisecond frame times
and then the the major 83 millisecond
frame time as well and because frame at
throughput isn't constantly 83
milliseconds 100% of the time
it's not really proper to look at it as
an FPS number this is a rare occurrence
but one that's important what's really
happening is one frame is taking 83
milliseconds to create as opposed to a
desirable 33 or 50 millisecond output if
you had a consistent 82 millisecond
output for 107 frames it would be
acceptable to call that 12 fps but this
is one frame repeated a few times before
a new frame is presented so it's not
really appropriate to average this out
into an FPS number the more accurate
description here might be stutter or
hitch if you prefer where the front
buffer is spitting out a new frame after
an 83 millisecond pause these 83
millisecond spikes seem to spaced
exactly one second apart from one
another when they happen if you look at
our frame time plot we don't know 100%
for sure why they happen but we have a
few ideas let's start by looking at CPU
utilization to try and figure it out in
the bottom right you'll see a number
that's bouncing around between something
like 12 and 20
that's a percentage and it's the CPU
percent utilization it does not appear
that we're running into this any kind of
strain on the CPU even during these
spikes we don't have a firm conclusion
of why this happens again but our
summation is that this could be a CPU
timing loop or timing synchronization
issue between the internal clock on the
modern ps1 remake and the original ps1
where the modern equipment may be more
accurate and a self-correcting another
theory that we'll get into a moment is
NTSC versus PAL and anyway we get one
new frame three repeat frames two new
frames and three repeat frames and then
cycle the result is still a one to two
ratio it just seems like there's a
synchronization issue that resolves
itself at the end of a one-second
interval as illustrated in the pattern
showed earlier where we dip to two steps
down to sixteen point six seven
milliseconds for good measure we also
rewrote our software to divide against a
20 millisecond interval instead of
sixteen point six
and better matching a pal output and
that resulted in similar behavior being
shown just at slightly different
intervals given that the behavior
repeated in both instances and having
confirmed through Richard Ledbetter's
articles that the device outputs at 60
Hertz we believe that this is a
synchronization issue between a 50 Hertz
game and a locked 60 Hertz device we
were able to validate this issue of
stutter output visually by stepping
through the video frame by frame this is
an objectively poor experience much of
it is to do with a 50 Hertz game on a 60
Hertz console the ps3 emulating the ps1
is on the screen now you'll instantly
notice that the line is now perfectly
flat which is how a console should
always look that's the whole point of a
console the point of a console is that
it's a single set of hardware that
allows for a consistent experience and
hopefully consistent frame rate because
the game developers that know what they
have to work with on the ps3 the
experience is superior than the ps1
classic it's still 50 milliseconds so
that's not great but we can actually
average this one out to FPS as it's a
flat line the entire benchmark the
average FPS for GTA on the ps3 is about
20 which just isn't a great experience
on either device the ps3 doesn't run
into the same issue of frame time of
spikes because it's a native NTSC
version of GTA remember the ps1 classic
is preloaded so you can't choose the
native NTSC version of the game you can
force it into NTSC mode via a dev
console which we did and that helps a
bit but you'll still get more frame time
spikes than on the ps3 the ps1 classic
also seems to undergo corrective spikes
downward following the spikes upward as
of trying to maintain a target frame
time and again we have footage of NTSC
forced on and you see some similar
behavior so doesn't really solve the
issue because it's not the native
version of the GTA NTSC game next is
Ridge Racer which runs NTSC on both
devices we tested both demo mode and an
actual race with demo mode showing the
ps3 at 33 milliseconds flat for 100% of
the race the end result is easily
calculable into FPS as it's fully
consistent at 33 milliseconds in terms
of frame rate we're looking at 30 FPS
average for Ridge Racer throughout the
demo there was 1/2 interval spiked up to
66.7 milliseconds on the ps3 in the
middle of our two minute captured there
was another single spike 250
milliseconds at around 1 minute 45 an
hour capture but neither of these is
particularly bad because it's not a
consistent issue on the ps1 classic we
observed spiky behavior at 33 point 3
millisecond baseline deviating from the
baseline to hit 50 milliseconds then 16
point 7 milliseconds correctively after
that at 32 point three three
milliseconds the frame output behavior
is summarized as hit miss hit miss hit
missed four frames where a hit is a new
frame and a miss is a replayed frame
that's normal behavior that's what you
would expect for 30 frames per second
given that there are 60 frames in the
capture file when we encounter one of
these spikes distanced exactly one
second apart from one another the
pattern changes to hit miss hit miss
miss hit hit miss hit the net is zero
and it seems like the device is
struggling to maintain a target frame
time and correcting upon those spikes
like the ps3 there's still the
occasional big spike like at around 33
seconds in our test which we can show
where we hit 67 milliseconds briefly
then start a holding pattern at 50
milliseconds for an entire second then
again for another entire second this is
not good it's a big change in framerate
fluidity it's for a long period of time
and it impacts gameplay negatively we
can play these side by side for a nearly
perfect comparison versus the ps3 just
to help make those differences more
tangible there might be some model
changes because it randomizes the cars
but this happens consistently and across
multiple passes the ps3 provides a
better experience once again while the
ps1 classic runs choppy and frame time
consistency finally looking at CPU
utilization the PSone classics elf
reports a utilization of about 30 to 34
percent average with occasional spikes
to 34 percent utilization we're far away
from using all of the CPU for the record
the non demo mode gameplay also exhibits
the same behavior on both devices
we can't synchronize these as easily
naturally but the ps3 mains consistent
and its frame times while the ps1
classic a
bounces around regularly Syphon Filter
was a game similar in some ways to metal
gear but critically had integration of
things like fog graphics and fire
graphics there was a time when these
were special the ps1 original console
and all of its 33 megahertz glory had a
dedicated solution for fog processing
and that was a big deal
Syphon Filter was - fog rendering what
battlefield is - realtime ray tracing
it's sort of leveraged as a technical
demonstration of what the device is
capable of putting the fire demo
side-by-side with the ps3 we see that
the ps1 classic again encounters
positive and negative spikes ranging
between sixteen point seven and sixty
seven milliseconds there are occasional
spikes - 67 milliseconds that aren't
zero some like around the 23 second mark
in the demo and these don't self correct
they appear to just be straight dropped
frames this is also repeatable behavior
between multiple runs the ps3 handles
this demo at a fixed 50 millisecond
frame the frame interval which is what
we would expect neither is a great
experience by standards of what we would
really want on modern hardware but the
ps3 is doing a bit better CPU
utilization on the ps1 classic
demonstrated in this clip runs closer to
47 to 50 percent load that's high when
considering it's a 24 year old game
running on modern hardware but the
emulation is likely the most abusive
part of the games execution and that's
why we see that high load also it's
still not the best CPU in the world
gameplay exhibits the same behavior on
both devices for Syphon Filter on the
ps1 we again see regular spikes and
corrective dips and on the ps3 we see a
flat line at 50 milliseconds and that's
for real gameplay not just the demo so
it's validated as for the PlayStation 1
classic versus the ps3 the ps3 is
cheaper and it provides technically a
better experience in just about every
benchmark we did worst-case is it's
about the same so if you just want to
play ps1 games and you want to do it on
a Playstation console buying an older
console used would probably make more
sense just make sure it's backwards
compatible because some of the newer
ones aren't as far as other options of
course there's the digital marketplace
that makes things easier but otherwise
the main reason to get something like
this is if you really want
collectible value I suppose would be why
you'd get it it's small it looks like
the original ps1 and if you just like to
have everything Sony or everything
PlayStation or something along those
lines then this is a bit smaller and a
bit more appealing than a gross ps3 that
you buy used for $15 on eBay so there is
a there is a peel there but if you just
want to play the games it's it's not
objectively the best it they do some
really strange things like the decision
to run 50 Hertz games for example on a
ps1 classic device that is outputting at
60 fps so very odd decisions by Sony
here as for the rest one more note here
on FPS FPS is an averaged number of
frames rendered per second over an
arbitrary window of time which becomes a
problem when it's used for live updated
counters in the corner of the screen or
FPS overtime charts when an FPS overlay
says 60 what does that mean when FPS
overtime chart spikes down to 10 FPS for
a single reported frame what does that
mean the FPS at a precise moment in time
is most likely to be calculated by
counting the number of frames delivered
in the previous second but what if no
frames have been delivered in the past
second the larger the window of time
sampled the flatter the graph and vice
versa calculate an average FPS over any
length of time by definition smooths out
the frame time spikes the best and most
consistent way to use frame rate data is
as an average over the course of a
longer test but even that has
limitations we do this for CPU and GPU
reviews and again you can start doing
things like percentile math you can take
one percent point one percent that helps
significantly and makes the data pretty
usable but even still there are flaws as
we've shown with our far cry 5 testing
with the 9600 K for example so FPS is a
an excellent and extremely useful metric
it's important a lot of people
understand it and it's easy to work with
but also for these console tests we're
probably going to stick to frame times
because we're typically comparing two
devices the biggest problem with frame
times is that you can't really compress
it into a big bar chart with 30 devices
like you can with
rate so that's a major benefit frame
rate but for two device comparisons
we're probably going to push pretty hard
for frame times in our console testing
anyway that's it for this one so let us
