on the channel we did all the jokes we
did the push the button and turn our TX
off and on joke they talk about the bad
marketing talk about the missteps by
Nvidia and talked about the product
positioning of the 2080 when it's viable
when it's not when does it make sense
when absolutely should you just buy a
1080i and said we did all that check the
channel for that one today we're talking
about well it's both today but we're
talk about the twenty atti
that's the interesting one here because
the twenty eighty if you saw our
previous video and gaming it
functionally equals a 1080i for
perforins so the twenty atti by brute
force alone should be better and more
interesting and that's what we're gonna
get into you for this one before that
this video is brought to you by be quiet
and the silent base 601 the silent base
601 is one of the quietest cases we've
tested recently laying claim to the
crown of silence on our charts and still
manages reasonable air flow by shipping
with a pair of high quality fans the 601
also uses well-designed panels and
unique ease of installation features to
streamline builds includes a well placed
dust filtration and is large enough as a
box to fit a full ATX bill learn more at
the link in the description below so as
previously stated in the other video
there'll be a link below for the testing
info stuff like that methodology
additional resources absolutely check
our 20/80 review there's a lot in there
that's applicable even here the twenty
atti so that's important you should
check it out and it also discusses the
marketing in more depth and about how
Nvidia handled this launch in general
because that's part of the review too if
we're all honest that affects how people
perceive the product in significant ways
so we'll leave that to that previous
video for this one twenty atti is
primarily going against the 1080i and
against the twenty eighty for purposes
of this comparison we have thermal data
we have frequency decay versus thermals
so we have thermal frequency charts we
have some rpm fan rpm versus thermal
charts we've got additional information
on just scaling 4k 1440 1080 how does it
scale across resolutions that all be in
here test methodology more below but
we're using 8086 K at five gigahertz
that's all in the charts and then if you
need game graphics settings those are in
the charts as well in the head
additionally for anything that says
overclock we use auto fan speeds for
them for gaming but for our overclock
stepping chart we pushed to a hundred
for the art 100% for rpm so that we can
figure out what is the temperature
versus frequency decay how much
frequency how many megahertz do you lose
as you increase the or increase the
temperature so that's part of what we're
looking at but otherwise Auto fan for
the overclock settings in the game
charts because that is the most
reasonable user scenario and then also
one final note raising board partner ten
series cards not the reference models
the reference models would make the new
reference models look a lot better in
the charts that's absolutely true and
video would probably pretty happy with
that realistically we think that most
people are probably using aftermarket
cards board partner cards and so it's
the fairest comparison but also the
previous reference cooler is garbage and
doesn't cool a while and it drops clocks
and this is a significant upgrade over
that so makes more sense to go with dual
axial versus dual axial in that regard F
1 2018 uses the ego engine and
translates to other codemasters games
we'll start this one with a more unique
chart just like in the 2080 review that
was posted separately looking at a
resolution scaling chart we can see how
the r-tx 20 atti compares two different
resolutions in the past some devices
like the Titan V and the fury X have
Illustrated stronger performance on one
end of the spectrum or the other like 4k
we're not seeing anything too special
about this one it's pretty
straightforward really perhaps other
games will show more interesting scaling
characteristics across the resolutions
as we sometimes see depending on Rob's
or other items in the pipeline that
benefit 4k vs. 1080p at 4k the r-tx
20/80 TI f e manages to chart top
unsurprisingly once again with the 99 to
101 FPS average frame time performance
is still all over the place but that's
an artifact of f1 and not the cards as
we see this behavior on all tested
devices
this marks the RT x 20 ATT is 23% faster
than the RT x 2080 and a 1080 TI alike
overclocking also gains the 20 80 TI an
additional 15% performance which is
actually surprisingly good not being
power limited would be
even better but Nvidia did restrict
overclocking pretty heavily with this
series of cards at 1440p the r-tx 2080
TI is one 60 FPS average LANs and as 20%
ahead of the RT x 2080 and gtx 980ti
which are roughly equivalent to one
another that's a gigantic price jump for
performance gain which is relative to
the price pretty small overclocking does
help but then again so does overclocking
at 1080i and RT x 2080 it's not like
this is a vacuum for the 20 80 TI 1080p
still shows scaling as this game is
primarily GPU bound with these settings
the GPU scale all the way up to 211 FPS
average on the overclocks 20 80 TI
posting scaling from the 20 80 TI f e is
196 FPS average of 7.7% that's about the
ceiling for this game far cry 5 and the
dunya engine are up next at 4k the r-tx
2080 TI fe manages to chart top again
not surprising at 74 FPS average this
places it ahead of the stock RT x 28 EF
is 59 FPS average by about 27% which is
one of the most noteworthy gains we've
seen of the two cards thus far the card
outperforms the stock GT X 1080 T is C
2's is the 7 FPS average by about 29
percent which is it good for
generational gains from TI to TI
unfortunately this 30% improvement also
bears with it a price increase of about
70 percent moving from around 700 or so
for a decent partner 1080 TI to $1200
for similar quality RT x 20 ATT is or
even the founders Edition which is
definitely not worth purchasing at that
price the partner models would make more
sense at this price but that's still
only assuming that you already want to
buy a 20 ATT I will talk about the
greater value proposition at the end of
this video
overclocked in the 28 e TI gets it to an
impressive 83 FPS average for a gain of
12% over the stock 2080 TI f e this is
one of the better over clocks we've seen
on the FE cards thus far the 2080 and
1080i remain equivalent but the 2080 ti
does post actual generational gains it's
just very expensive to get them here's a
frame time comparison at 4k showing the
RT X 2080 2080 TI and GT x 1080 D I
remember frame times are all about frame
to frame intervals
pacing so more consistent delivery is
better a lower number is also better as
16 milliseconds represents 60fps the
r-tx 28 ET i posts both measurable and
observational improvement in frame time
consistency and overall frame rate
although much of this is through brute
force and the value proposition doesn't
quite line up with the gains at 1440p
far cry 5 positions the RT x 28 ET i at
around 127 FPS average with low as
reasonably times 288 FPS one percent and
80 FPS 0.1% the RT x 2080 lands at 105
FPS average allowing the 2080 TI a gain
of about 21% intergenerational versus
the 1080 t is c2 we see a generational
gain of 22 percent this makes sense as
the 2080 and 1080 TI are functionally
equivalent in performance overclocking
the 28 ET i puts it at 138 FPS average a
reasonable gain over stock by about 9%
we could get more with an unlocked power
limit as found on partner cards but
those are still pretty locked down just
better than this one 1080p proves to be
an invalid test as it becomes CPU bound
and demonstrates the 28 ET i 2080 and
1080 TI all within a couple of frames of
one and others but we're going to show
the chart anyway just to show what a CP
bound scenario looks like my pearly 4 is
up next and uses the essaouira engine
this title as stated in our RT x 28 EF e
review is one of the most important for
a well optimized low-level API
implementation in a game this game has
shown scaling for asynchronous compute
in Volta previously and we now turn to
it for a Torian analysis at 4k Sniper
Elite for posts the RT X 28 e TI fe
stock card at 108 FPS average with lows
exceptionally tightly timed though this
isn't a behavior of the card more so of
the game the RT x 28 ET i ends up 25%
ahead of the GT x 1080 t is c2 the stock
card which operates an average FPS of 87
that's not as much as both have led us
to believe sadly but it's a start
scaling versus the RT x 2080 is
functionally the same as the RT x 2080
basically equals the 1080 TI and
performance overclocking gets the 1080
TI and the arts
2080 both to around 90 FPS plus or minus
1 which closes the lead of the r-tx 2080
TI fe stock card down to 19% overclocked
in the 2080 TI fe widens it once again
scaling to 123 FPS average for a gain of
13% over the stock 2080 TI fe not bad
but still somewhat limited shadow of the
Tomb Raider runs on a modified crystal
engine and is still a brand new title
unfortunately despite being an RDX title
it doesn't have any RT ax
implementations at this time at 4k the
r-tx 2080 TI fe performs at 67 FPS
average
leapin the RT x 2080 and GT x 1080 TI by
about 24% each these hold at about 54
FPS average overclocking boosts us up to
79 FPS average on the TI f ii which is
an impressive 17% gain over stock and
distances the card further from its
counterparts at 1440p is scaling wanes
from a 24% lead over the 2080 at 4k down
to a 20% lead at 1440 the distance grows
as resolution increases which is
indicative of a ROPS advantage on the
2080 TI the 1080 TI is again roughly
equivalent with the 2080 so we'll skip
past these comparisons let's see if our
proof of concept is correct at 1080p the
r-tx 2080 TI is now 18.7% ahead of the
r-tx 2080 and gtx 1080i measuring at 159
FPS average versus about 134 FPS average
this further solidifies that the
neutering architecture scales better at
higher sampling rates and resolutions
which also means that it'll do better in
handling anti-aliasing at higher levels
than its Pascal counterparts the idea is
the same your sampling the pixels a lot
of extra times which is functionally a
resolution increase GTA 5 runs on the
rage engine and although it's from 2015
it remains one of the most popular games
on Steam at 4k the RTX 2080 TI fe holds
77 fps average a generational gain of 21
percent over the 1080 TI sc2 and at 64
FPS average the 1080 TI outperformed the
RT x 2080 in this game so the 28 e TI
manages 27% over the 2080
and overclocking is still helpful but
the overclocked
2080 ti leads the overclocked 1080 TI by
about 27% 1440p posts winding results
even though bottlenecking isn't really
here yet that's not until 170 FPS or
higher the 2080 TI's lead over the 1080
TI diminishes to 15% making a mockery of
the disproportionate generational price
gap our overclocked stepping chart is
next completely stock we measured a peak
frequency of 1890 megahertz with no
changes applied average frequency
dwindled down to 17 50 megahertz which
is a result primarily of power
limitations as usual the voltage slider
does nothing at all and has no impact on
overclocking performance or maximum
clocks although we did end up sliding it
all the way to the right at this point
just in case it's not until memory
overclocking that voltage ticked up to
one point zero volts which is it lower
than Pascal generations 1.06 three volts
it's 1.09 three volt operating range
that said we don't know that there's
really full confidence in these tools
just yet so the voltage we're not sure
how accurate that measurement is from
the software but it would make sense
that it would be lower than Pascal so
that does at least somewhat line up with
what we'd expect anyway boosting the
power it's 123 percent that's the second
step in our process or the second row
this allowed us to hold an additional 50
megahertz on the clock to 1800 megahertz
average that is even in spite of higher
temperatures we eventually found a 20
100 megahertz peak similar to the 21 15
megahertz peak we hit on the r-tx 2080
but immediately power throttled and hit
a power perf cap our average was closer
to 2,000 megahertz where the GPU
remained when kept in the 60s Celsius
closer to 70 really the GDD our six
memory was stable at 850 megahertz
offset but not beyond that note again
that this is in times by extreme and at
this overclock doesn't necessarily hold
stable in every single application that
exists it's per application generally
that these will work this one however
did work in all of our games so these
offsets applied in all game tests this
is also with 100% band speeds to keep a
lower temperature which were not used in
the gaming test we stick to Auto fan
speeds for gaming tests with overclocks
for realism
but either way the 100% speeds at about
60 DBA 59.4 DBA of noise do boost the
clocks noticeably look more closely at
the yellow cells next though for these
we observed frequency thermal responses
at around 79 degrees
where the clock dropped by 50 megahertz
and again at around 62 degrees although
this is reflected in our previous r-tx
2018 on t i overclocked slepping chart
from the other video the RT x 2080
review check that for more frequency
thermal data for more frequency and
thermal scallion we looked to a 3d mark
lubing pass that put the card under 30
minutes of strain this is what they
completely stock GPU with no overclock
applied at all under these conditions we
see the clocks immediately drop from
just over 2000 megahertz down to around
1900 megahertz within the first 90
seconds the clock eventually settles at
1800 megahertz a significant downgrade
from the initial operating frequency
with the GPU core temperature of 75
degrees Celsius this is indicative of a
limitation of the cooling and power
management one of which is intentional
the cooler can maintain higher clocks
but it have to increase the fan speed
further that's what we illustrated in
the previous chart and videos fan
profile is set to favor lower noise
levels which means that we do sacrifice
clocks in the process board partners
should pick up the ball here because
they are able to cool better with a
larger cooler fan speed also ticks up
with all this as shown in our next
charge GPU temperature sits around 75
degrees Celsius with occasional spikes
while the fan rpm ramps from 1500 rpm
about 35 DBA to 2,000 rpm or about 42
DBA and video doesn't appear to be using
its own ásinger to span technology at
all here even though the fans are
capable of spinning independently it's
like they completely skipped on using
the feature
despite end-user support you could a
synchronously tune these to be fair
though in the past we've found that they
do generally work a bit better if
they're synchronous but we haven't
tested that with this card let's bring
in two more lines onto this chart make
it a bit complicated these are our 4G
DDR 6 and BRM Maas temperatures or
MOSFET temperatures measured at hotspots
on the card via thermocouples that we
attached on average the vrm Mouse stays
below 70 degrees Celsius when the card
is under stock conditions and that's not
delta T for our regulars that's just
straight temperature because I'm not
comparing it to anything else and the
vram is around 70
four degrees Celsius these are both well
within spec and it would appear that the
cooler does fine for the vrm and vram
when under stock loads despite being an
overall inefficient overly complex and
overly expensive design the FE card does
have the capability to cool the VRM
NVRAM so job well done there if you're
wondering how overclocking impacts
thermals here's a look at our torture
run from the thermal bench the r-tx 28
ET i stock card before the massive
teardown that we filmed again before
that operated at about 73 to 75 degrees
celsius during this 30 minute power
virus torture load running over clocks
with the settings we use for our gaming
benchmarks and with the fan left to
regulate itself under Auto settings GPU
core temperature climbed to 77 degrees
and fan rpm not shown here clients from
2,000 rpm the 2100 not bad and decent on
the silenced focus as for vrm thermals
under this scenario the overclocked card
pushes vrm temperatures upwards of 90
degrees Celsius for the hottest MOSFET
we can find and that's with a k-type
thermocouple while stock temperatures
are closer to 72 degrees technically
that's within spec most MOSFETs don't
trip OTP until around 150 degrees and
they don't deer ate hard until around
125 degrees still it's a bigger climb
than is necessary in temperature
considering that better cooler designs
exist for vrm cooling and at this hefty
premium of $200 extra you'd expect good
BRM cooling on the founders edition cart
GDD our six operates within spec under
both scenarios measuring eighty degrees
when stock and about the same when
overclocked the 2080 ti then is far more
interesting than the 2080 it's not the
most exciting but there's real
performance uplift over things you can't
buy you get a Titan V for more money
sure but versus a 1080 ty there is
actual tangible increase in performance
there's a visible and observational
increase in measurable increase in frame
time or frame to frame intervals and
those are good things but then if we
look at the numbers again just like with
the 2080 you're looking at something
like at 15% in the worst cases but
generally 22 to 30 percent gains from
my ten adi to a twenty atti if we're
looking at a bored partner card versus
the founders edition card and that will
change we're gonna be testing these
cards from EVGA or testimony from asus
to that number will increase but only so
much and it's still going to be roughly
thirty to thirty five percent with board
partners for the most part can't predict
the future but that's about what it's
gonna land at two thirty thirty five
percent and there's best-case scenarios
over a ten eighty TI and the price
increase is massive because a lot of
these cards are gonna be eleven hundred
twelve hundred dollars in the US and
then MSRP is officially a thousand which
is not a terrible increase in terms of
the performance increase but no one
wants to see that and realistically the
cards even though MSRP is lower than
founders edition it's been a while since
we've seen cards follow that model and I
actually dropped below founders Edition
and hit MSRP so I I don't know I don't
know how many cards will hit that and if
they'll even have the factory
overclocked chips because they might not
Nvidia is reportedly according to the
tech powerup selling chips that are
locked from factory overclocking you can
overclock but not the factory and that
will impact performance too and probably
on the lower end cards close at MSRP so
let's just assume eleven hard twelve
hundred dollars per card there's a 1080i
that is a an extremely hard sell unless
you have a specific need like if you
absolutely can't get what you need with
a 1080 Ti and an extra twenty thirty
percent will get it then I guess you
have one option otherwise developers can
get use out of fount of the twenty
series cards we talked about that
already people using blender as it
updates might get use out of it Unreal
Engine when it updates to 4.21 4.20 is
somewhere around there we'll eventually
get it's our TX SDK implementation
finalized and you can start really
working on things there so there's room
for people to buy the cards but
generally speaking unless you really
need it and you know you need it because
you can't get what you need from a 1080i
and a 1080i value eyes is better but at
least with the 2080 ti you're getting
something at least there's a tangible
gain for the money you're spending
whereas with the twenty eighty verse the
1080i is basically the same product in
terms of
horns you're just gaining features that
have no present use for gamers so we'll
revisit this more with the partner
models but that's it for this one
