the United States Postal Service versus
gamers Nexus and the mob mattes we're
gonna have charts and benchmarks on this
video just like PC Hardware reviews
except it's a bit of a different thing
like I said we're shipping some mats
trying to see what they will withstand
for purposes of this video we're using
this mat which actually is one of our
autographed ones and especially
autographed hit put a smiley face on the
corner so if you get the signed mat with
the smiley face on it right there then
you know that it's the one that we use
just for this video that I'm holding now
it will add precisely zero dollars of
value but you can say to all of your
friends hey my mat was in that video we
don't know what the mod mat is go to
store dock heroes Nexus not in that it's
an anti-static building surface to
protect your table your PC hardware
components that's grounded properly and
a very high quality rubber and print on
it you've seen a couple of your favorite
youtubers using it recently probably so
what we're going to do is basically put
this into some tubes tape them or staple
them in different ways and see does a
$400 stapler versus 20 cents of tape
work better and then also as a bit of a
bonus if you don't get this special
signed mat later in the video we make
this monstrosity which seems just
completely impervious so we're gonna use
the tube anyway if you get a tube with
about 20 staples in the end tab also it
was used in this video all right so
let's get start we're gonna start with
some drop testing which will basically
be just four supplied scenarios straight
down shear force trying to break the cab
by blind shear force to the tape on the
outer edges at the seam and then we're
also going to be doing some timing tests
of the $400 stapler versus applying tape
see which one's faster for us which one
will obviously work better for our
shipping purposes so let's get started
with that so for this one this is a what
you would call an empty tube given that
there's nothing inside of it and we
actually had one instance where a
customer who purchased a mod mat
received an empty
we've shipped a lot of them there's one
problem and basically it got bounced
around
I think misdirected or something
eventually they decided to actually
deliver it empty rather than I don't
know really anything else so today we're
actually going to have real benchmark
charts just like a review of different
taping versus stapling methods so we
bought this $400 pneumatic stapler and
we're gonna try this in terms of time
requirement to staple the end caps on so
they can't come off versus a couple of
different pieces of tape so we've got a
few different taping methods one is
three pieces of tape wants four pieces
of tape and then just for demonstration
purposes I'm going to show you also a
tube that's been sealed with just the
caps and no tape at all so there's
nothing holding the caps on it this will
be pretty pretty easy I don't even need
to drop it I don't think so that's
that's why we need tape obviously we've
always shipped them with some kind of
tape but now we're trying to increase
the Arsenal a bit just to make sure we
don't have another instance where an
empty tube is delivered to a customer
and obviously we of course replace those
but it'd be better to not happen at all
so first thing we're testing those two
pieces of tape on the bottom cap only on
the bottom no cap on the top basically
gonna hoist it into the air put my knees
into it and let it the whole mat fall
and apply shear force straight to the
bottom of the cap which theoretically
will break the tape basically at the
seams at the edges here so let's give
that a try that will create the most
force I think without being completely
ridiculous although I've been the postal
carrier I guess
so it's let's count these so one
okay well okay so if we put a chart up
on the screen or something
right now we're out one toss for two
pieces of tape let's try 3 2 3 and you
can see also what's happening here the
tape is actually splitting at the end
from the shear force so this is split
obviously it's not like it's just
falling off so that's seven or eight ish
its collate okay so I would call that
acceptable for the most part it is
starting to actually come apart now but
we're at like 15 or 20 toss or something
lost count all right
I think three would be acceptable for
the most part probably do four for
safety let's just try it though I just
want to be clear I'm going way harder on
this one than the first hit and there's
barely any damage
so four might be a solution I think we
can more let's stop there where there's
a low-security couple more shake weight
test
four pieces should survive end to end
for any kind of ship in to be is no tape
broke one go three pieces was okay but
not really what we want but that was
like out of 15 to 24 never gonna break
reasonably how they giving the foot post
I was gonna do it and now finally for
staples which this might take a while
[Laughter]
but what happened is the cap came out
with all the stage
I'll Senate I have a the outside part
here just ripped clean through the
cardboard so I don't know that you need
to test this again I mean we could but
if that's gonna happen even once that's
not acceptable considering for pieces of
tape that would never happen and maybe
would break if it got like shipped it to
Mars accidentally and then came back to
the US I think that's about what it
takes to break four pieces of tape but
the staples that's just not acceptable
so clearly clearly the staple gun it's
not the right tool for this job this is
the most physical labor I've done in my
entire life thank for this one I think
we can say 400 bucks it's what I would
say think this can go back to where to
whence it came and once we send this
back once it came I got a refund and
we'll go for four pieces of tape I think
that's probably the takeaway now just in
case you're curious we I was gonna say
it's okay if it falls but I actually do
want my money back just in case you're
curious we have timing results as well
so let's just let's do some timing tests
and see how long it takes for each one
we'll put a chart up on the screen and
then the results will be irrelevant
anyway because four is clearly superior
than four staples
if the
doesn't get there in one piece it
doesn't matter how fast it is I want to
give this one more try just in fairness
so what I'm going to do is we have one
that we piece table before I just can
put staples around the entire thing I
paid for the staple separately from the
staple got anyway so I might as well use
them so let's uh let's give that a shot
it's gonna get a bit noisy in here
okay it's like a like a faction design
that so I will say that Bostitch stapler
is really damn cool tool but totally not
fit for our job based on what we saw
previously it is pretty fun to use that
but let's just go ahead and test this
and like I said this will be the method
but a funny bit broke right there
this will be the map that has the smiley
face on it so if you buy an autographed
mod mat ID stored I care is accessed on
that and you see one with the smiley
face where we showed it in this video
then well congrats I guess I don't
really nothing really comes with that
other than congratulations all right
test number one okay much better okay
all right so no I not by doing the same
so the conclusion if we use $10 of
staples and two to two minutes of time
maybe a little less minute of time it
looks like they'll hold I'm not sure
that would hold water though if we sent
this through customs anyway pretty sure
if we told them you know what just pull
the staples yourself it send it back to
us
or maybe sawed it in half and you get
him on that splitter so I think we're
gonna go I have to throwing away all
these tests tubes go with four pieces of
tape for the final decision and you know
the staple guns fine I think it's gonna
have to go back staplers a little faster
technically but not that much faster or
not I mean once you factor in the point
that it took like 25 staples to get it
to hold I think I think we're behind on
time so yeah for piece of tape better
overall you've now learned what it takes
to withstand the post office and if you
want to buy one of the mod mats we have
one here and pull the autograph to the
smile
Faye's you might get it otherwise stored
on cameras next on net to pick up any of
the autographs are not autograph or one
of our new 3d laser engraved GM logo
tear down crystals if you would prefer
that thanks for watching and subscribe

I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
