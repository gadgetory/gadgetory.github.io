dotnet and this is our fallout 4
volumetric lighting benchmark and
explanation of volumetric lighting in
fallout 4
when benchmarking fallout 4 on our
lineup of GPUs we noticed that the r9
390x was outclassed by the GTX 970 at
1080p with ultra settings this has
certainly happened before in some very
specific games but it's rare and it
caught us by surprise that given the 390
X is comparatively high raw horsepower
the performance differential was still
about 5% at 1080p favoring the GTX 970
which theoretically should perform a
little bit lower in frame rate than the
390 X so this gap is reversed a little
bit when moving to higher resolutions
like 1440p we see the 390 X actually
pull ahead and that reversal makes sense
because the 390 X should be objectively
superior at 1440p than the 970 it's just
capable of handling more pixels but the
advantage 970 at 1080p required more
research to fully appreciate so that's
what we're here to do today these
findings spurred on a day's worth of
research of settings and that unveiled a
few settings that heavily impact FPS but
we were never able to produce any
particular favor toward one manufacturer
or another by changing these it
generally kept the same Delta just with
a higher FPS output by lowering settings
shadowdistance is a really good example
of this we saw FPS wins of about sixteen
point seven percent which translated to
around 20 FPS on the 970 and the 390 X
when lowering shadow distance to medium
from ultra but even with these changes
the 970 still outperformed a 390x at
1080p and that was worth investigating
further so we eventually discovered that
console commands can be used to toggle
levels of volumetric lighting and
godrays in the game which seemed to
impact FPS fairly heavily and you can do
this by using the tilde button and then
do gr and on or off or you can just type
gr and look at all the options you can
set
detail levels and debugs and things like
that as well
fallout uses Nvidia's volumetric
lighting effects and godrays something
that immediately sort of through a red
flag as a benchmarking item for us so
for the unfamiliar volumetric lighting
is named such because it appears to sort
of creep through the air and it
interacts with other volumetric effects
like smoke and fog and clouds and in
games with volumetric particle effects
this is another big visual gain to have
the volumetric lighting interaction as
well and fallout for volumetric lighting
is primarily comprised of godrays which
are basically just shafts of light that
shine down from the Sun or other very
bright sources of light and we decided
to run benchmarks and see if the 390x
can outpace the 970 at 1080 and take a
lead when God rays are disabled on both
devices before we get to those results
though let's get back into some basic
information on how God rays work and
talk about the way the beams are
actually displayed in the game and
translated through the engine and things
like that
so God rays cast beams of light that
also interact with reflective surface
materials and shadows and generally
create the apparent depth that is given
in some of these objects and what you're
looking at right now is a debug tool
built-in to Fallout 4 and the tool shows
us the presence of God rays using two
different modes wireframe which creates
red and green wires indicating strike
points and light passing and then
godrays only which turns off all of
their light sources and shows only the
illumination created by a god raise the
ladder the god rays only mode is
extremely useful in understanding
exactly why God rays are volumetric in
this game and shows that even when an
object isn't directly in the line of a
beam of light it will still receive
light from illumination shed by that
beam
hence volumetric and actors in the
vicinity actors being NPCs in this game
in the vicinity of reflective materials
will receive some of the light from God
rays as well so because volumetric light
can bounce and proliferate when inner
acting with certain surfaces you'll see
that standard standards by passers-by
those types of people in the general
area will receive light from the
reflectivity and the bounce and things
of that nature we talked about this in
more depth in our GDC 2015 interview
with Crytek who explained physically
based rendering to us we talked about
star citizen and things like that so do
you check that interview out to go to
the channel and just search for
physically based rendering you'll find
it or Crytek probably and with Nvidia's
implementation of volumetric lighting
everything is done using tessellation or
the process of effectively doubling the
triangles on the graphics hardware for
increased apparent detail so
tessellation that's what it does it
ultimately doubles triangles it
increases triangle count and creates
more apparent detail that where the
parent is very important because it's
really just an appearance thing it looks
like more detail but in the game the
Polly's it's still the same polygon
count it's not increasing the poly count
and walls or faces or anything like that
this apparent detail increase allows for
more displacement and smoothing of
surfaces something we talked about with
Epic Games in an interview JH searched
the channel for tessellation for that
and tessellation also creates the
appearance of high resolution surfaces
which means you'll see more bumps and
divots and generally higher fidelity and
apparent depth with volumetric lighting
through Nvidia's fallout for
implementation which uses game works
the lighting is fed through tessellation
processing instead of post-processing
effects which will sort of hammer the
GPU clock and eat more cycles so there's
a valid reason to move the tessellation
especially because tessellated lighting
gives the advantage of allowing light
shafts and effects an illumination to
still show even when the source of light
is obfuscated by some object in the game
or something like that
tessellated lighting lends itself to
cooperation with occlusion and is
exactly why you can see the light poring
over the edges of a surface area or a
surface rather even when that surface is
physically blocked for the light source
so if the lights if you were looking at
the Sun
and you sort of walk around a building
that building ends up blocking the Sun
but you can still see the sun's rays
being cast around the edges of the
building like the roof or something that
is a result of using tessellation and
Vidya as it happens is really good with
tessellation and they know this and they
built their architecture around
optimizing it for tessellation and games
look at the witcher 3 with hair works
that's all tessellation and am these
struggles with it so again look at the
witcher 3 with hair works md is not
great with tessellation they're good at
a lot of things they're good at
different things than nvidia each
company has its advantages from its
architecture they've taken different
approaches philosophically to their
architecture but the use of tessellated
lighting does mean that andy will
struggle a bit in this regard and fall
out at least so we tested that stuff
first off note that our original bench
course took place during a nighttime
playthrough around 11 p.m. in game and
that created the best mix of GPU
workload for FPS testing this new test
for volumetric lighting strictly was
conducted during the games at daytime to
get the most exposure to god rays here's
a look at the chart showing tessellation
impact on the 390 X and the 970
obviously the FPS results will be
different than the previous test because
it's conducted at a different time of
day different weather or things like
that
the 390x still trails the 970 at 1080p
even when both device is disabled
godrays and that's probably an
optimization issue or drivers or
something with the game but we still see
a measurable performance gain for each
device by toggling God raised and the
390x has the biggest gain of the two it
moves from 71 fps 280 FPS average and
increases its 0.1% bottom line
considerably to 44 from 36 by disabling
God raised the average FPS gain
calculated is about 12% and the 970 s
average FPS gained is about 7% it moves
from 81 to 87 fps so the gap shrinks but
the 970 still retains its lead at 1440
the 390x still runs just ahead
of the 970 thanks to the 390 X's
advantage in the additional pixel
workload processing Department the 970
kind of gets bogged down by all those
extra pixels and the gap is of course
shown still when you toggle godrays so
if you need some extra performance
that's a good way to do it what we found
though ultimately is that even disabling
many of the volumetric lighting effects
will not inherently grant Andy a
performance advantage it fixes a lot the
performance advantage for AMD is a
larger Delta than for NVIDIA in general
because of the way the optimization
works but the gap is still there it's
not eliminated this is a good way of
improving your performance of about 12%
or so on something like a 390 X so if
you do need a quick gain for performance
then I would suggest playing with
godrays but it does take away a lot from
the games environment because the game
isn't particularly impressive and the
textures and modelling Department anyway
so make your changes wisely shadow
distance and godrays are the places I
would start the gap is still present for
AMD and NVIDIA even with volumetric
lighting off and if you like this kind

help us out help us make more of this or
just hit the channel and watch the other
stuff cuz that's the biggest way you can
