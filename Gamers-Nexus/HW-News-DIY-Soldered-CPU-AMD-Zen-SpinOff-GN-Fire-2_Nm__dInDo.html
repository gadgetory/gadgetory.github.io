hardware news episode this one is packed
with some really cool stories that's why
we decided to film another one so close
to the last one couple things here AMD
is working with a China based vendor to
work on some new CPUs they are licensing
there's an architecture for that so
that's big news also be talking about
Taiwan tech company trade secrets being
stolen by their China based company
counterparts and also DIY soldered CPUs
by one mr. dare Bauer the overclocker
trying to solder his own CPU because I
guess if Intel's not gonna do it he
wants to try and also scientific
advancements and coolant materials some
Jeon exclusive leaks about vago laptops
incoming and more before that this video
is brought to you by Thermaltake and the
view 71 enclosure the view 71 is a full
tower case that's capable of fitting
three video cards and most
configurations it's also one of the
better cooling cases in our recent case
testing bench lineup the view 71 has
hinged a tempered glass doors on either
side that make it easy to open and show
off and it comes with at least one rain
fan though you can get the RGB version
if you prefer learn more at the link in
the description below so the GN news
first first off we have an overclocking
livestream with the 8086 cake coming up
this week it'll be tomorrow I think at
the time this video airs so Wednesday is
the day we're doing a livestream
Wednesday July 11th at 6 p.m. Eastern
Standard Time and tune in for that
basically you know overclock the 8086 K
as far as we can a lot of it will be
figured out live because I haven't had a
whole lot of hands-on time with it
other than to make sure the thing works
so definitely tune in for that stream
will be a lot of fun and then also we
had an issue with this this location
almost burning down so I've got some
photos of a breaker panel and I just
wanted to share this because it's it's
we're very lucky that this did not turn
into a bigger issue but basically we had
some circuits installed for testing and
one of the circuits installed was a 20
amp circuit for power supply to a scene
you may remember that we got a Sun Moon
power supply tester recently so that
didn't cause any of the issues but the
new circuit put in the electricians we
had
I'm out left as I understand it some
wires hanging inside of the panel which
caused one of the breakers to jump or
bridge to the busbar there was a lot of
very loud arcing you could hear from
outside the building even so the fact
that you could hear arcing electricity
from a hundred feet away through a wall
it tells you how much power was really
involved in this scenario and basically
it almost burned down the house and so
there's scorch marks everywhere has
results of it in addition to leaving the
wire hanging and arcing things the
electricians also installed incompatible
breakers with our breaker panel that I
obviously wasn't aware of so that was a
problem those were the first ones that
melted it was actually a sort of series
event firefighters responded we were
able to keep it controlled nothing
actually burned down but it was a close
one so obviously we're very mindful of
these things now this wasn't even caused
by us this was just an electrician not
doing their job properly so $1,600
mistake that hopefully I get refunded
for later we're working on that but we
had to replace the entire panel so that
was a bit of a dilemma and what I'm
getting at is we were taken down for a
couple of days there to get new
electrical panel and installed and all
that stuff so that was a lot of fun but
just goes to show that there's I guess
make sure your electricians bring out
someone to inspect it is what I'm
getting at here so anyway that set us
back a little bit then we have the the
NASA almost dying problem with which set
us back some more but we have that all
fixed up now so everything's good to go
and we have a lot going on this week
livestream is one of them specialized
throw and paste testing that I'll tell
you more about later 8086 k thermal
testing special CPU overclocking
features that we won't go into detail
yet on and the in one a one review so
this week will be packed with really
good content if you've been looking
forward to some more testing base stuff
I know the last week or two were a bit
dry on testing but a lot of that's
because of all of the administrative and
catastrophic failures that we've had to
deal with in terms of the panel and the
size of the sign ology nast both of
which are now resolved thankfully all
right first major news item is the Andy
a news item about CPUs and
and seeing the Zen architecture and x86
to a new company in the space and II is
licensing its Zen architecture to
Chinese manufacturer hi GaN the new x86
processor is codenamed Deanna and uses
Andy's Zen architecture as part of
China's made in China 2025 program which
is part of China's plan to become a
global technology capital not just a
manufacturing country as for x86
licensing that's the tricky part
Tom's Hardware reports the following
quote as part of the licensing agreement
AMD established a joint venture in China
called the Tianjin higua√≠n advanced
technology investment co limited or
aesthetic I guess is the easier way to
say it and agreed to license its x86 and
SOC IP for chip development that it
consists of Andy and both public and
private Chinese companies including the
Chinese Academy of Sciences that is
heavily influenced by the Chinese
government to stay within legal
boundaries HMC licenses its IP to high
gan which designs the x86 chips and then
sells the design back to HMC so quoting
Tom's Hardware therefore that part the
reason that's all very important is
because if you don't know Intel owns the
x86 license and the owns the 64-bit
license and they cross license with each
other so each one can work within those
parameters but to bring a new company
into the space for cpu development and
get x86 is more or less impossible
because you're relying on Intel who hold
the x86 license to actually grant that
license to the new contender in the
space so that's pretty interesting and
it shows I don't know it's it's a
roundabout way for AMD - I suppose sub
license to this new company that is
based in China also these deana chips
are only intended for the Chinese market
so don't expect to see them outside of
China next story is very interesting so
this is something published by The Wall
Street Journal that we didn't really
encourage you to read it's by the tech
industry and it's about Taiwan
technology companies having some
corporate espionage issues with other
companies in the space so the Wall
Street Journal published an excellent
story about
the technology industry trade secrets
and the practices of keeping those
secret as a whole including the theft of
those trade secrets so we wanted to
bring more attention to the story enough
they need the help but I will link it in
the show notes below if you want to
check it out the gist of it is this in
2016 a state-owned Chinese semiconductor
manufacturer Shanghai Holi micro
electronics Corp infiltrated Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company
which many of you are likely familiar
with TSM C it is often called in our
space so TSM C makes things like GPS
there's silicon manufacturer they work
with Nvidia they work with AMD they work
with bit mains become a big customer of
theirs so TSM C had an issue with this
company where the state-owned Chinese
semiconductor manufacturer was able to
illegally access quote reams of trade
secrets to quote The Wall Street Journal
and the employee implicated in this
corporate espionage was sentenced to a
suspended 18-month prison term for IP
theft we can also see moves involving
micron lately where Chinese courts have
suddenly expressed an interest in IP and
copyright lawsuits that benefit Chinese
competition particularly state-owned
competition the country is looking to
launch its own memory supplier if you
weren't aware of that and would
basically offer competition to SK Hynix
Samsung and micron and of course none of
these three companies are necessarily
innocent of doing non shady things
either but there will be a new vendor
potentially joining the space recently a
micron engineer was recruited by UMC the
company that just had a preliminary
injunction imposed on micron in China
and that engineer has been indicted on
charges of trade secret theft as he
moved from micron to UMC although UMC is
a taiwan based competitor the illegally
taken documents were used to design
chips for Fujian genoise integrated
circuit company a Chinese semiconductor
company or manufacturer
Nonya is another one that you might be
familiar with this is a smaller dram and
NAND manufacturer and one of the
smallest in the industry
Nonya is responsible for most of the SSD
DRAM caching modules that you'll find on
Mt
- and 2.5 inch SSDs so there's DRAM
cache they probably make it they
recently sued one of their engineers or
former engineers for supply and
manufacturing photographs - Sinha Yuna
group Limited which the Wall Street
Journal reports is China's largest
state-owned chip maker so according to
this write-up by a Wall Street Journal
technology theft has allegedly doubled
in the last few years vs. 2013 and it's
actually the whole articles are really
fascinating to read about our industry's
intellectual property and trade secret
practices protecting those practices and
the corporate espionage so that's
definitely the most interesting part but
encourage you to check out the story
check out the show notes below if you
need a link for it but pretty
interesting stuff that's very related to
our industry and what we can expect over
the next few years the next story moves
away from Asia and back to Germany where
we have der Bauer who recently tried to
solder a CPU so this comes back to
something that a lot of you have asked
us in the past which is well if Intel is
not going to solder it and you're
replacing the thermal paste with liquid
metal why not just solder it while
you're at it and our answers as always
has always been it's really basically
not feasible at least not for us there
Bauer had access to a couple of extra
tools though and bought some for this
and he worked with a Trinity APU partly
because it was a non soldered component
it's old it's not really worth anything
so the chances of screwing up the AP are
really not high risk and we'll save the
conclusion for his video if you want to
see the conclusion go check it out but
to give you an idea
part of what Durbar learned is that the
process for soldering a CPU is actually
obviously pretty complex and what he did
is went and looked at the patent
documents by intel on their soldering
process because those are all public and
he looked at it and tried to use that as
a guideline for what he wanted to do
working with a couple of soldering
engineering companies in the space to
figure out the best solution that was
feasible for someone in a knot
fabrication plant environment to solder
a CPU some of the things he learned were
that you have to coat the backside of
the wafer there has to be a mix of
titanium nickel and gold and then a
solder sheet and a couple of
materials in there as well it's just a
big stack of materials he's got a
diagram of it in his video you can't use
normal solder because the melting point
is too high which is a big problem that
he faced in his attempt to solve this
problem
additional coating of layers on the
wafer including gold are necessary to
protect the CPU and actually make
contact with anything and then he also
had to edge the indium oxide layer with
hydrochloric acid every hour or so while
working on this because it would build
up I suppose an oxidation layer on the
outside of the components he was working
with soldering and also could not get
straight indium to just stick to the
service and had to find an alloy of some
kind which I believe used some
percentage of silver maybe 3% silver in
there as well with the indium and
ultimately face an issue with thickness
of the layers of solder this is
something we've talked out with our
d-lighting practices where a lot of the
performance gain is actually from
getting rid of the thickness between the
dye and the IHS so you're bringing the
IHS down closer to the dye and thinning
out the thermal interface between it
whether that's solder or something else
it doesn't matter the idea is the same
which is that the more you reduce the
thermal interface between them the more
heat can transfer just straight into the
IHS and get out of there rather than
something where you've got gaps and
thicker layers that can have some
uncharacteristic or or improper thermal
results for what we're going for which
is ultimately to reduce the temperature
of the dye not to increase the
temperature of the dye so go watch their
bowers video for the results I've left
them out just because you should watch
his video really it's very interesting
we it's worth it and check out the link
below if you want to see that one next
one is scientific advancements in
cooling materials that were put out this
week so science journal recently
published a research paper detailing
efforts to create a highly thermally
conductive semiconductor that can be
worked with as a replacement to silicon
so it's electrically similar to silicon
but with higher thermal conductivity the
researchers stated that thermal
conductivity of their non-toxic boron
arsenide solution is now reaching 1,000
watts per meter Kelvin for comparison
copper would be at around 405 watts per
meter Kelvin
at 25 degrees Celsius with aluminum at
around 200 watts per meter Kelvin
silicon's thermal conductivity tends to
be around 150 watts per meter Kelvin and
that ranks the boron arsenide material
as about seven times more thermally
conductive than traditional silicon
this would allow heat to exit the
silicon faster and spread across the
service area faster and then into the
attached cooling devices we're currently
unclear on if this boron arsenide
solution will be able to replace silicon
components and things we're used to
working with or if it's more of a
specialized component for the future for
example in highly thermally sensitive
scenarios like in a spaceship or an
Intel I 9 CPU for example they're about
the same really it might be a future
engineering Avenue and something to pay
attention to but this is still in the
research paper phase and they have
actually been designing and working with
the material but we're not anywhere
close to any kind of mass production or
adoption just yet the next one is about
Vega laptops incoming this is a note
that we received so gamers X has
received information from close to AMD
that Vega mobile devices are on the way
at this point and the first one from
what we understand is basically a
cut-down Vega GPU from the GPU
architecture on desktop that we already
know
so architectural II won't be all that
different from Vega 56 or 64 however
it's going down to 1792 stream
processors typically you just multiply
by 64 so 56 times 64 64 times 64 is 4096
so you'd have 4096 stream processors on
Vega 64 1792 is the cut-down version and
it's going to have at least four
gigabytes of HP m2 and it will be using
40 nanometer process so far not a whole
lot of changes clocks will likely be in
the range of 1100 to 1350 megahertz
depending on the thermal scenario and
final engineering decisions that we
might not be privy to right now over
clocks are also supposed to be at least
unlocked on some devices from what we
understand and our sources have further
informed us that it's essentially again
a cut-down Vega architecture GPU just in
a laptop so there is some debate
potentially going on of if there's going
to be a higher capacity solution in
terms of memory then four gigabytes
could be eight be a bit odd to do six
but certainly possible just cause at
that point you're doing two stacks
anyway so
we'll go with eight but we're unclear on
what the final choice was there so
anyway coming to the laptops soon TM not
clear on when but it might be towards
the end of the year would make the most
sense based on a and these other
announcements
next up workstation performance GPU
testing our friends over at Tech Age
just published a detailed benchmark of
workstation performance with different
GPUs this is something we don't get too
far into on our side of testing but we
wanted to highlight Rob Williams work on
benchmarking high-end GPUs for
non-gaming workloads the testing
included 3ds max 2019 rendering or the
Titan X Peas managed to outperform the
1080i and quad rose and also blender
where the AMD rx Vegas 64 card excelled
to a point of only being outperformed by
dual Titan XP cards tech gauge has also
tested Vegas and other software not to
be confused with Vegas but Vegas the
editing software find the rest of their
tests at the link in our show notes
we're go to tech age comm look for their
workstation GPU test we've previously
reported on Arctic cool ins plans to
bring completely passive coolers to
market the company has finally launched
its coolers it names the Alpine 12
series and aims to offer them at around
$15 the coolers have pre applied mx2
compound no fans included as is the
nature of passive cooling and use a
simple aluminum fin stack atop the
socket
these aren't rated for much they can
take about 47 Watts TDP depending how
you measure it and will work with both a
m4 and low-end Intel 11 5 X components
and socket types finally hardware sales
for the week cooler masters original H
500 P yes that one the one that fell
apart and then later has been
significantly improved that case is on
sale for about 110 bucks but it includes
a $30 rebate if you count those not
everyone does which is fair and if you
do count it it brings down to about 80
bucks so the case still has every single
problem that we didn't like about it
originally they're trying to clear the
channel because as those go out of stock
the stuff with the changes that fixed
all the problems we had and everyone
else had will come in to stock so
they're clearly trying to clear stock
that said if you're willing to put about
half an hour of work into it and find
mesh somewhere you could do the math mod
that we did and you'll basically have an
aged 500 P mesh which is actually
case we highly recommend for 80 bucks
plus the cost of 30 minutes of your time
and a filter so we would not recommend
it as a standalone purchase but if you
are okay with modding or I think it
might be a fun project it would be
worthwhile at that price because it is
actually a pretty good deal and you come
in under the age 500 PMS still and come
out ahead
Corsairs vengeance lpx memories also
sort of on sale as much as memory can be
these days that is available in 16
gigabyte to buy capacities at 3000
megahertz for around 176 which is likely
marked down and part due to its green
PCB which I'm sure Corsair is ashamed of
now that they've stuck RGB and black
PCBs on every single thing that they
make so that's on sale sort of and then
EVGA is new 750 PQ supernova power
supplies the Platinum certified ones
that just came out are sort of markdown
as well for about 14 percent off on new
life but anyway links below for those if
you're interested in any of them as
always show notes and the links in the
description below if you want to try out
the sources for any of this stuff you go
