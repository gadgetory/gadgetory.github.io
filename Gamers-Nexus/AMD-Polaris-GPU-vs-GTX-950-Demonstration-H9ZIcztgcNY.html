donna and we were at AMD's a booth at
CES 2016 primarily looking at the
limited Polaris display right now but
there's some other cool stuff that will
be talking about as well before getting
to that all this content from CES 2016
is brought to you by I by powers revolt
to small form factor gaming PC looking
at polaris right now there's a limited
sort of black box demo where polaris is
on my left that be your right and then
there's a gtx 950 on the other side what
is being shown here is primarily the
power draw so you're looking at
performance per watt and right now both
systems are locked to 60fps and
battlefront through the configuration we
asked if we get on market but not right
now as far as the frame rate goes its
meeting 60 on both cards the 950 and the
Polaris GPU which is yet unnamed a lot
of specs still not out there and the
performance in terms of wattage is
currently 73 on Polaris and 129 on the
GTX 950 and then once the games out of
the menu in actual gameplay we're seeing
closer to 90 on Polaris and 140 150 on
the GTX 950 so that's really all we have
for the actual demonstration in terms of
why this is happening it's primarily the
move to FinFET so there's a new process
node for polaris that's 14 nanometer
FinFET which is literally shaped like a
fin so the transistor kind of has walls
on the sides and that helps prevent
leakage and improve power efficiency
this is technology that's been around
for a little while now it's used in some
Intel stuffs used elsewhere so that's
moved to fin FET the other wattage
improvement is from gcn so there's new
gcn architecture versioning with Polaris
again not a ton of details right now but
on the Cu side on the gcn architecture
side that is supposed to be improved
with performance per watt as well and
we'll move over to the razor laptop next
that is actually connected to an
external GPU we've looked at these
previously with Silverstone I don't
think that product ever shipped but
there was a silverstone external GPU
enclosure and we've seen it with
alienware as well with proprietary
connections instead of the USB type-c so
we're going to look at that next and
then check the article in the
description below to read about some of
the other stuff
like the HDR and SDR versus between
displays that's a pretty big deal that
you should definitely read more about so
thank you for watching check the next
video for the razor laptop information
and hit that patreon link the official
video if you want to help us out i'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
