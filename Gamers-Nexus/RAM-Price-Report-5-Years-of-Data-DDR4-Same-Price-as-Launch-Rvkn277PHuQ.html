learning that gddr5 memory price has
increased by twenty to thirty dollars on
the Bill of Materials cost lately we
started looking into rising system
memory prices as well RAM pricing has
proven somewhat cyclic over the past few
years we've reported on memory price
increases dating back to 2012 and have
done so seemingly every two years since
then this research piece pulls five
years of trend data working in
collaboration with PC part picker as we
investigate why memory prices might be
increasing and when we can expect a
decrease along with other information

memory prices and GP prices have made it
basically impossible to build a cheap PC
lately when you have DRAM prices that
have gone up two to four times in the
last year or so it's getting a bit
unattainable so what we have to first
set the stage and put things in
perspective is a table of our own memory
purchases over the last couple of years
where we can see the appreciation and
value of those sticks of memory that we
bought and here's that table of memory
that GM staff members have purchased
over the past seven years alongside the
percent increase and the per month
appreciation of the kits in 2011 Patrick
bought a ddr3 1600 CL 9 kit for $44 an 8
gigabyte capacity that kid is now
available for $80 an 80% increase or an
appreciation of 50 cents per month I
bought a ddr4 2400 16 gigabyte kit in
2016 for 81 dollars and it's now
increased 143 percent in price when at
196 dollars today that's an appreciation
of 2 dollars per month if you bought a
truckload of
memory in early 2016 you could have had
better gains than some stocks and you
could even sell it nearly for retail
price after using it for the whole
period the most egregious case was
Patrick's $65 ddr3 1866 purchase in 2016
which is now a hundred and eighty
dollars now for kits don't make a big
enough sample size to call trends or
anything like that but we have aggregate
data for far more than the four kits we
just looked at typically something like
an increase in ddr3 price for example
would be spurred on more by the
industry's switch to ddr4 and the
tapering off of ddr3 production these
things generally would lead to a slight
increase in price however this increase
is insane and ddr4 has also gone up so
this is more than just a downtrend in
product popularity causing a spike in
price because ddr4 has gone up as well
and the prices really drive the point
home again it's really hard to build a
cheap computer right now largely because
of memory it's one of the components
that you can't really skimp that much on
it without cutting out some performance
at some level just to one more time
drive it home and put it in perspective
though we bought one of the cheapest
eight gigabyte sticks of memory
available recently like a few weeks ago
for an in-house build that stick of
memory for us the same quantity was two
times the price of a two by four
gigabyte ddr3 kit that we purchased
seven years ago so that's the state of
the memory right now the launch price of
ddr4 is basically at parity with the
price it's at today there has been no
downtrend in price over the last three
years actually it's about four years now
so yeah it's fair to say the industry's
in rough shape with DDR but we can look
into why and see if there's a trend here
and when it might go down let's get into
some short-term charts and then we'll
dive deep with the charts that PC part
paper generated specifically for this
research piece the company automatically
generates price history graphs for each
of these kits and all of them trend
upwards on all retailers logged
primarily new egg and new eggs
third-party sellers if you include them
there's a page with graphs recording
general trends
rise by memory speed and capacity which
proves that the prices of our kits
aren't just flukes
2x8 egg whites ddr3 1866 kits really
have increased by a hundred and seventy
five percent in retail price probably
made worse by manufacturers shifting to
ddr4 production while customers
desperately try to save money by buying
ddr3 for older systems each of PC part
pickers public charts are for an
18-month period and more limited in what
they reveal we reached out to BC part
pickers seeking some longer-term numbers
and they weren't able to share raw data
but they did agree to generate some
graphs for us the next few charts were
generated for gamers Nexus by PC Bart
Baker and show a five-year time period
spanning 2013 to 2018 we specifically
requested this time period as it
includes the 2013 SK Hynix factory fire
which was assumed to be a heavy player
in the then rising DRAM prices and the
first graph tracks to four gigabyte
sticks of ddr3 1600 megahertz kits like
the one we bought in early 2011 there's
been a clear cycle of rise and fall
since at least early 2013 which is
mildly reassuring in a big-picture sense
it almost looks cyclic which if that's
true would mean we can expect an
eventual downtrend there's a probable
end to the pricing madness but we just
don't know exactly when that'll be the
second chart from PC part picker
includes the high necks factory fire in
September 2013
something will highlight which caused a
brief spike in prices but it also
reveals that there was already an upward
trend that seemed to have regained
stability after October of that year
manufacturers had no inclination of
lower prices after recovering from the
fire and prices were painful until ddr4
was introduced in September 2014 and
that's roughly where prices leveled out
and began to drop but there doesn't seem
to be an overall downward trend in price
that you might expect from old tech in
2014 we wrote an article predicting mass
adoption and switch over from ddr3 to
ddr4 in 2016 which largely came to be
true however these graphs are of prices
not sales numbers so we only have half
the data the second graph is a 2 for
gigabyte ddr4 sticks which don't have
the benefit of ddr3 s'long sales history
ddr4 was only sold beginning in 2014 and
there were relatively few kits available
for tracking so the price average
fluctuates more sharply towards the
starch with a smaller sample sizes
taking in isolation this looks like a
nightmare
- for gigabyte ddr4 sticks caused almost
as much as they did when they were first
introduced with no indication of
leveling out when lined up with the
previous ddr3 chart the prices are
clearly following the same cycle
the problem with DRAM prices isn't
simply dollars per gigabyte although
that's part of it in an ideal world the
price per gigabyte of memory would
decrease at the same rate that the
desired capacity increased in other
words a run-of-the-mill memory kit would
always cost the same amount as price has
fluctuated it seems like desired
capacity has increased steadily and this
is evidenced by some old articles in
2009 for example life hacker was posting
articles about whether or not four
gigabytes of memory was really necessary
only six years later they were debating
the same thing with 16 gigabytes I'll be
it with a different conclusion the thing
customers are really complaining about
is the price of a reasonable amount of
memory which is subjective and harder to
track what we're gonna do next is walk
through a list of key contributors to
memory supply and pricing today and
these will break into a few categories
primarily supply and demand and then
subcategories of each for starters
supply starts with limited manufacturers
in 2018 only three significant DRAM
manufacturers remain in business
Samsung SK Hynix and micron Sam Sun is
responsible for about 45 percent of all
DRAM manufacturing right now so most of
it and SK Hynix and micron respectively
are at 29 percent and about 21 percent
each so Samson's got most of it but
there's really only three smaller
companies exist
Nonya for example provides memory chips
for SSDs the cache d ram that's on there
but it's really only three companies
that are relevant to us four sticks of
memory that go into system memory slots
this consolidation has made the market
more stable but it's also made
price-fixing potentially easier the
stock prices of the two smaller
companies which
we can show now blot micron and SK Hynix
lining up nicely with the price charts
previously shown comparing a five-year
period if we superimpose one of those PC
part Picard charts to really illustrate
a point there's a real trend of supply
and demand at work here it's not
arbitrary the next supply category is
that of price fixing price fixing is
when manufacturers intentionally
conspired to keep prices high rather
than competing in a way that benefits
consumers the terms price fixing and
price gouging both have legal
definitions and should be used carefully
and the DRAM industry in the past has
paid out damages for price fixing we've
reported recently about the Chinese
government's investigations into
allegations of drm price fixing recently
something that again
happened before samsung once had to pay
out 300 million dollars because of it in
2005 and then another 110 million in
2014 alongside micron hynix Infineon NEC
and Toshiba totaling 310 million the
catch is that the fixing in question
occurred years earlier between 1998 and
2002 the only tangible result for
consumers was a payout of a few dollars
apiece and the fines are low enough that
we alleged crimes that may well justify
anti-competitive and anti consumer
actions production limitations are the
next category this one is particularly
interesting because drm like cpus and
gpus is an advancing business the
silicon manufacturing for example has
refinements regularly as the fabrication
process changes and then we go through
node or die shrinks so production then
is a big issue here with memory pricing
and availability as one factory or group
Samsung hynix or micron decides to
update its production lines its node
that it's on they do have to take out
some of their manufacturing capabilities
during that time to make the switch over
it also means that they're now
fabricating different processes out of
the same factory so you supply different
types of memory each of which will be in
less supply than when the factory is
fully switched over so this is a big
contributor and because there are three
companies it comes down to a question of
who wants to change first
because the minute one of them take
part of their production lines an update
or to expand and build a new factory
which is a different question altogether
the other ones have an opportunity to
gain market share this would be a good
time for example if Samsung does it for
hynek's or micron to try and increase
their supply output and gain market
share in the DRAM market so this has an
impact on price as it has a direct
impact on supply the final category is
disasters this hasn't been a problem
lately but in September of 2013 a fire
at SK Hynix is factory caused an
immediate jump in DRAM prices and a dip
in hynek's stock the changes were huge
at the time summarized well by a bleak
extreme tech report but they corrected
within a few months it's possible for
natural disasters to have more
significant and widespread effect as the
floods in Taiwan proved with the hard
drive industry several years ago now we
get into demand this is split into a
couple of categories as well one of them
one of the less important ones actually
the least impacting out of the ones
we're listing is mining crypto mining
gddr5 memory prices have skyrocketed
recently this is a question of a few
things mostly just supply because now
you have every cell phone using a lot of
memory in it it's all the same chips as
in your memory modules as in your GPUs
they all come from the same place so
crypto mining alone has increased demand
slightly not as much as some other
things but each of those cards is using
four to eight gigabytes of memory coming
from the same three places as your
system memory the price and gddr5 for
example for an 8 gigabyte GPU has gone
up about 20 to 30 dollars for the
manufacturer to pay which is massive
typically they only see $5 fluctuations
so this is another contributor to memory
prices because the same fabs make all
the same components splitting fab time
between more devices SSDs are also a
contributor they have increased an
adoption for desktops but more
importantly nearly every laptop now
ships with SSDs for primary storage
every phone uses flash memory for
storage
Apple has completely switched over to
SSDs or nearly completely and other
mainstream notebooks in affordable price
classes
are now using 128 to 512 gigabyte SSDs
as a baseline component like GPUs these
components come off the same production
lines as demand for GPUs Rises as it
rises for phones and SSDs the price is
going to be affected for system memory
another demand indicator is system
specifications the official minimum for
Windows 10 is only 2 gigabytes of RAM
but minimum specs for new software and
games obviously increase over time that
doesn't explain that current price is
outright but along with the arrival of
ddr4 it does explain why anyone bothers
to buy new Ram at all
ddr3 sticks aren't compatible with
modern motherboards or CPUs that creates
demand for new memory and customers have
to pay for it whether they want it or
not they also have to pay for the new 8
gigabyte requirements in some cases or
strong recommendations and 16 gigabytes
in the case of some higher-end games
with ddr3 one can reliably transition
between architectures and reuse memory
which is a luxury lost in the past years
the final demand category is mobile
devices smartphones don't individually
carry much memory but they make up for
it in sheer quantity Samsung's Galaxy s4
launched with 2 gigabytes of RAM in
August 2013 and within six months it had
sold 40 million units the iPhone 6 and
6-plus launched a year later and I've
sold more than 220 million units
combined to date in the first quarter of
2017 380 million smartphones were sold
and a first quarter 2017 PC sales were
62 million DIY PC sales are still a tiny
minority compared to the pre-built
market and the number of devices that
require memory servers for instance or
divert manufacturing capacity away from
ddr4 sticks entirely like smartphones is
rising even as the PC market either
stagnates or declines excluding high-end
gaming PC's we're not fortune teller so
we can't tell you where DRAM prices will
be tomorrow or in the next year and
we're not market analysts we're
journalists so we pull all the data and
take a look at it from there if the
market shakes out the way it did in 2013
and 2014 it would appear that 2018 would
be a year of steady prices possibly some
decline in 29
this also correlates with some reports
that we've seen online from market
analysts so at this point keep an eye
out for financial news but it does look
like the hynek's and micron stock prices
are loosely correlated with the price
over DRAM over the last few years so
they're benefiting to some extent from
this Samsung's harder to compare because
they make literally everything so their
stock price doesn't change as much just
from DRAM prices even though they do
make most of the DRAM in the industry
either way though the long term charts
make it clear this is somewhat cyclic
even if it's not beneficial right now
this is something we talk about every
couple of years the prices will come
down it sucks that they're high there's
not a lot we can do about it for now
other than try and reuse RAM where
possible and for those of you upgrading
to ddr4 I'm sorry you picked a bad time
but hopefully we'll see a decline in
2019 I don't know about before then
we'll see maybe it's always possible
that some major event in the industry
would change in a way that prices can be
affected immediately more likely long
term as production changes factories
change things like that we'll see the
updates further down the road than today
but hopefully this gives you some basic
information on why the DRAM pricing is
the way it is even from affiliate data
from what we've seen you all purchasing
through affiliate links the adoption of
16 gigabytes has really gone down in the
last couple months it's it's kind of
going backwards we were seeing a lot of
a 2x8 gigabyte kits being sold and
suddenly we're back to two by four
gigabyte kits because that's all people
can afford which is completely
reasonable so that's it for now you can
