nexus donna and again we are at pax east
2013 it just keeps on going we're doing
videos all the time now i'm here with
francois from sauropod working on Castle
story and we did some coverage of Castle
story a little while ago it's been a
while now the prototypes been out
they've been working toward beta so
Francois can you tell us about some of
the updates that you've you guys have
been working on the last few months
since the prototype some of the biggest
stuff you're doing okay so one of our
main one of our main updates is the the
user interface because it needed a lot
of work and we tried to make a
contextual menu that lets you interact
with the world according to what you
selected in what you were doing very
cool and what were some of the biggest
complaints that you took to heart from
the users what really fueled your
redesign of the the contextual menu and
you
well often characters would get stuck
and you had no way to know what they
were doing and why they get stuck so if
you can decide which task if you can ask
them as I'm gang two more clear task and
ask them directly to do some things you
can you get a better understanding what
they're doing because they were only
driven by their desks before they had no
micro management features so if someone
didn't move you just didn't know what to
do with it now you can ask him to break
specific blocks or pick up specific
objects or drop what they have and it
lets you understand what your characters
are doing what's for for newer players
who haven't yet played the existing
build of the game what are you guys
really excited about putting out there
you know what's what's currently driving
development what do you just really want
to show the public right now well and
I'd say I would like the game to be
interesting and I hope that they what we
made the work we made we'll just let
people explore it better because we had
a problem because people working when we
got the prototype out people we're
hitting limits very soon very quickly
when they were playing so you have to be
very very M
insistent to get through and understand
what would happen what's interesting
though is that you can try it and you
know in five or ten minutes you can
understand what's happening and go to
build whatever you want we want to so
it's kind of like we just started to
have something that can be played really
by anyone sure sure what's what are the
current plans for for new I guess we
were talking a little bit about
multiplayer yes so I know everything
still in development you can't make any
promises right now but what can you tell
us just even vaguely about multiplayer
right now well we have characters moving
around from different computers that is
our first basic they have a hard time
cutting their trees correctly but it's
going well and we're progressing slowly
but it works and it will there will be
able to clear that's for sure for now
it's more cooperative because we have no
way of asking people to fight each other
they it would completely crash but they
can interact and start building and we
would like to have some sort of co-op
mode which Chico up mode but still up in
a few in the next few months very cool
what in terms of buildings and resources
and materials any plans there is is the
current feature set pretty pretty set in
stone or do you have a lot of new stuff
you're looking to release what what are
you what are you guys looking at ok well
with a new update that unity made a few
months ago we can use it's easier to use
a different kind of shaders that will
allow us to expand our set of textures
in the game it would allow for more
different kind of blocks more different
kind of textures and a possibly
different sort of islands and our
environments we'd have a lot to a lot of
work to do to get to that point but we
would like to develop in that direction
that people let's say explore snow
islands or
and maybe gather some marbles in place
or store metal and other place you know
I don't want to promise anything but
we'd like to go into that direction a
little in terms of construction
improving the question the construction
gameplay cool are you planning to
continue updating the current build
while you wily progress and development
or you know you guys plan to maintain
the beta build as it is well it turns
out having people testing what we're
doing is a very good help it lets us
have direct feedback over what we're
doing so we do plan to update what we
have right now until it is something
worthy of calling a bit up cool any and
everything you really want to put out to
the fan so your backers anything you
want to promote a lot you know a message
that you really want to put out to them
well I'd say thank you of course because
you know we're things are going very
well right now and I we gotta love the
very positive feedback here at PAX a lot
of love from many people so I'm very
happy about that and and yeah that's
pretty much it alright so you heard her
from France why he says thank you to all
the backers and we are going to show you
in the full article we'll talk about the
new UI talk about some of the new
features coming up so check that out in
the description below and that's all for
now thank you for your time check out
