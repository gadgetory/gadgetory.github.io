new and Vidya r-tx super cards
so the 2070 super and the 2060 super the
most immediate change is that there's
now a mirror on the front of the card
probably related to RTX actually what
happened was it was a manufacturing
difficulty the original one the
roughness threshold was too high so
they've dropped the roughness value to
zero five percent of you will get that
joke before that this video is brought
to you by thermal take C 360 DD C hard
tubing water cooling kit if you're ready
to dip your toes into the water and
build your first open-loop cooling
system the Thermaltake c 360 DD c hard
tubing kit comes with all the components
you need the kit includes a three sixty
millimeter radiator three 120 a RGB fans
a copper w-4 a RGB water block for the
CPU a pump and res DD c combo and all
the fittings needed to build a full CPU
open-loop learn more at the link in the
description below these cards should be
mostly probably the same as the original
but we want to look at them anyway
because the original 20 60 and 70 had
the issue of well one too many screws
for a video card making maintenance
difficult but also we want to see if
anything's changed on the PCB so have
the components changed like the MOSFETs
or anything like that or is it all just
the same board designs as the existing
cards and one reason we're curious about
that because the 2070 super is
functionally a twenty eighty and it's
the same die as a twenty eighty die so
we can expose that look at it and then
does that change any of the the
requirements elsewhere but we didn't get
a twenty seventy Effie so there is a
reference board for twenty 70s but
Nvidia did not sample Effie when it came
out they wanted to be a partner launch
for lower prices so anyway let's start
with this one we're gonna be working on
the GN large mod matte today which is on
store dock cameras axis dotnet on
backorder now and then we also have our
brand new toolkit to try out and I have
some fun behind-the-scenes stories about
this as it relates to our TX as well so
here's the new card they did in fact
change the plate and it's mirrored now
it also says super and it's got the the
kind of green background
plus side if these were pre tested by
Nvidia we would know because there would
be fingerprints all over them that was
one of the bigger challenges with this
card not working with it just filming it
in general is difficult so beyond that
everything's pretty much the same we can
go ahead and remove this and relink was
there any link on the 2070 I need to
call Nvidia a quick question for you I
just now despite finishing the reviews I
just now noticed that the 2070 has a
super has n V link fingers on it does it
does it support and B link okay okay so
if I had to it just it works the exact
same as any other NV link setup okay
cool I I will make a note of that in the
video then so update I had to call
Nvidia I didn't notice this actually I
guess well add this in front of the
review as well but 2070 super supports
unreeling and I just I wanted the column
to make sure it wasn't like a feature
that's disabled it's actually enabled it
does have the Unreal Inc fingers on it
these are the original 27 TS you can see
they clearly do not have the NV link or
the SLI support as it may be so that's
kind of cool it's because this is a it
is a 2080 die it's not the exact same in
terms of what's enabled but that is why
I envy links on here so it's it's a
tu-104 die now
whereas originally this was tu 106 and
the 2060 is T 106 and the 2070 super is
now tu-104 which is what the 2080 is so
anyway let's start with taking this one
apart cuz it's more interesting so like
I said new toolkit Tom Stewart out
gamers ex has done that we actually
started designing these before our TX
even came out and the tools are picked
for GPU disassembly so should be pretty
quick so I've mentioned this before
in almost every teardown we've done of
the 20 C or even 10 series cards these
tiny screws if you do end up
disassembling one of yours be really
careful with them because they're not
strong and if you go if you take the
approach I've just screw the screw in as
tight as possible like you might do with
these
or ones which are spring tensioned
you'll snap the the screw shaft and then
it'll be stuck in there and the head
will come off so when you retighten
these if you take yours apart just don't
go to tie it just kind of turn until it
stops and then don't do anymore okay so
as we start pulling this apart I will
make an important note we have already
done all testing on this so everything's
complete 3b is actually being edited
right now as we film this part so
everything's done except for the
thermocouple testing so I'm going to put
some probes on the MOSFETs and the and
on the memory but obviously that
requires card disassembly first well
we'll fix this up later okay there we go
all right so back plate pretty much the
same as before it's got some thermal
pads for back of the GPU that's actually
thinner than it was previously but
throne pad for the GPU back of the
memory for the back of the inductor line
and that's it it's uh it's not changed
so far then we get to these so as a note
obviously this holds in the cooler on
the partner models you can these days
typically just remove these four and the
whole cooler will fall off the face of
the card and then you can just replace
that they're all pasted and leave the
base plate on there this one working out
to remove both so we will need a four
millimeter hex head for that which is in
our tool kit as well and this like not
to show the toolkit I guess but it is my
first opportunity to demonstrate
something when we were making these
originally the sort of the head for
these hacks heads that you can get
standard from most factories was landing
on top of these caps or hitting them so
we had to get them custom ground down to
not hit the cap so that was one of the
things we we did specialized with the
toolkit trying to keep things like that
in mind
so same amount of screws as previously
oh and I guess that demonstrates the hex
head is you don't want a magnetized hex
head on these sometimes the screw will
get stuck if it is so
it just ours is not magnetized but
anyway this is same amount of screws so
same type of screws same placement
guessing everything will be the same
except for the GPU will be different and
then the PCB will see but it's probably
the same PCB as well no we should do in
this video is just check if the water
blocks will fit if the water blocks that
already came out for RTX will fit these
cards I can do that someone requested
that on Twitter and it was a good idea
cuz they probably well it's unlikely
that anybody would change anything for a
lot of reasons like one they don't have
to it's enough the power designs enough
already and two it would be kind of
really not great for the ecosystem in
terms of cooler design partners would
have to make new coolers and then water
cooling partners I have to make new
blocks so I'm thinking they'll all fit
but we'll just check for you officially
to make sure all right so that will wrap
I think all the screws for the backside
we're gonna have some from the i/o let's
get a count it's been a while 30 32 34
so that hasn't changed
backside of the card now this does have
to come off on these designs on a lot of
the partner models you don't have to
take the expansion plate off but on this
one you will and it's mostly gonna be
like pH zero zero Phillips heads which
we also have but there is one pH 1/2 pH
ones back here that's just a size why
isn't this degree coming out huh three
pH one excuse me three in this thing if
I read my own if I read my own
instruction guide that's included in the
kit would have known that there's that
so if you wanted to water block this
card this is the process you would be
following you would not be you would not
be taking this apart this taking this
thing apart really sucks if it's the
same as previously and it involved on
the original it involved hot glue
holding this thing in
there actually might respond it was an
adhesive holding it in so replacing the
fans would be a terrible experience but
replacing the cooler isn't so bad it's
only it's only this many screws so first
time you do it you might be spending a
half an hour on it takes about five
minutes to completely disassemble once
you know you're doing it does look like
a lot of screws on the face it though
same connector as previously this one
over here which has a history of some
issues that we might talk about in the
future just keep the thermal pads where
they should be thermal paste is
different actually so this is the kind
of interesting but not really that
important part the pace these companies
typically use a shin-etsu paste it's a
it's a thermal paste supplier and you
can see the dots in the outside of it so
like those dots right there it's
textured that is just the remnants of
the silkscreen they use when they apply
the paste so it's typically like a it's
literally a silkscreen like for a shirt
and then you dump paste on it and you
sort of paint over it
we actually have Clips if maybe we can
find one from the coolermaster factory
where Coolermaster assembles we can't we
can't say the name we're not allowed to
say the name of the company whose video
cards coolermaster assembles but we were
allowed to show footage of it I'm still
not sure I understand why that rule
exists but if we show you the footage of
the cards being assembled you will
probably be able to figure out what
company they belong to
and anyway coolermaster assembles cards
for a company relevant to this topic and
they have a paste applicator that we
showed for their AMD cooler assembly
line so it's not and the video cards
that doesn't leave too many other
options out there but I'm talking about
the AMD coolers we're using a silk
screen anyway Fuji probably pads I think
for the memory and then this blue
thermal potty thermal putty for the
inductors and the rest is just these
other pads and video still make
a lot of different types of thermal pads
in there then you've got the same the
same a power connector for the LEDs this
eventually talks through I to see so
that'll give you your feedback to the
chip for how the powers behaving and if
there's a short on the board somewhere
it should detect it and freak out and
lock into 1350 megahertz and then think
that'll wrap the cooler itself cold
plate is as it was before nothing has
changed there I'm just trying to prevent
the pace from sinking all around that
cooler so we're just going to spray the
rag around the borders of the cold plate
I'm not going to tear this whole thing
down again we did it before you can
watch our previous two-part video on
disassembling the original twenty eighty
or twenty atti at launch but you can
actually see in here so you can see more
of that blue thermal putty in there so
it's a bunch more thermal pads and putty
holding the base plate which is this bit
to the actual vapor chamber which is
right here which is then secured by I
believe just typical soldering to the
heatsink so anyway nothing's really
changed for the cooler
look at that PCB in a second so the die
is bigger than the twenty seventy I
guess we've got 20 seventies next to me
I can demonstrate that too
there you go tu-104 let's make a really
quick job of a twenty seventy there's a
twenty seventeen on a skew that's what I
was talking about partner models very
easy alright it's a twenty seventy black
you can tell I'm the one who worked on
this last because there's a lot of
thermal paste on it okay there you go
so the dies there's a this is the twenty
seventy super and this is a tu-104
which is the twenty eighty die - four
ten so that ten is relevant a one is
just revision number so ignore that but
tu-104 four ten that's the relevant
number that's been changed
and then this one is the 2070 non-ace q
they got rid of that to my knowledge
so a tu 106 - 400 and when I say a skew
I don't mean a 1 I mean it used to be
like our other 1 rxz ultras tu 106 - 400
a and the a there indicates a better bin
ship that has a higher clock so anyway
that's differences in the chip you can
see they are clearly not only different
labels with different sizes and there's
an actual like the eye size measurement
easily found online but we're gonna do a
quick caliper external measurement so
instead of 18.7 we've got like a 20 23
or so but anyway there's an actual dye
measurements online and Nvidia's own
documentation so the MOSFETs were three
one six zero three one six zero on the
MOSFET and it looks like everything's
the same but I'm gonna double check and
just take apart or 2080 as much of a pan
as it is and then we'll be able to just
tell you definitively if water blocks
for the twenty eighty will fit the
twenty seventy super so might as well
just do a side by side is it the same
yes although I guess that's a bit
different they cut these in half
previously some kind of just like sad
cost-saving measure or something now
we're gonna have another card sitting on
the set background for the next five or
six months that needs to be reassembled
and you'll know why because I don't want
to take the 15 10 15 minutes it takes to
go through it
it's really it's probably like ten I
guess with the repays didn't clean and
go we're doing this for that one Twitter
user I wanted to know if they would fit
and because it's pre-release we don't
have bare board photos so for you all
it'll be easy to just go check online
and find for the board photos these can
only be taken out so many times before
they start to strip so I had to find a
different size screwdriver because I've
widened them all alright these will go
in electronics recycling okay so the
question has anything changed let's see
I mean there's small differences like
this serial number identifier is not on
the new one or the old one I mean but
that's completely irrelevant
yeah this card is the same the back is
also the same yeah so have you ever
water block for a twenty eighty it'll
fit on a twenty seventy super easy
enough it will say twenty eighty on it
for what that's worth so I guess the
vanity will be wrong but let's just go
ahead and show this there's the old die
tu-104 - four hundred a tu-104 - four
ten so that a signifier was gotten rid
of that meant Bend and it's a 410
instead of a 400 Reve but this GPU is is
actually going away it will be phased
out they move all this aside all right
so that's the twenty seventy super 2080
blocks will fit on it if they fit a
twenty eighty reference card and and we
think will work so yeah that's that one
move that aside and let's hopefully
quickly get through this I think we're
gonna have to pull a screwdriver from
another kit for this one if it's like
the twenty sixty so there's some fun
behind-the-scenes information for you
when we were developing this tool kit
the twenty sixty came out a bit later
and so these cards came out when we got
our final samples in for the tool kit
we were just started the production or
honest it's like you can't really stop
production you can but it's not like the
lay it for a month it's like delay it
for several months at our size because
we would have to do samples again and
make sure the new tools are good but and
really a decrease the size on just the
2060 of just one screw by 0.5
millimeters and I remember discovering
that and I was just like oh my god
because one it's just stupid anyway
regardless of our making a tool kit to
kind of to not standardized sizes across
your lineup but but that was just a
particular reason to annoy me so we'll
see if that's still true it was the hex
heads and then also on the 2060 there's
this thing which I've always suspected
was for like a USB type-c internal case
connector or something like that that
maybe they decided to fill in later but
not quite sure what it was for what you
see when it was made how long of a they
have this ready for well these were made
May 31st so getting them end of June I
mean that's they might have been sitting
on them for a little while but that's
reasonable with Computex they're in the
middle so anyway that's kind of funny
information that you get I still don't
know why I'm video change this one I
know it doesn't really matter but I'm
curious like they had to have a million
or Millions definitely millions of those
other screws so why not keep using those
maybe it was for component clearance of
the because even if you'd grind down
like a 4.0 you're probably still going
to clip some of those caps so maybe it
was just for component clearance with
the capacitors because the board is
smaller
this is still the card that sucks
to disassemble I'm not gonna go through
it all again if you want to see it watch
our 2060 teardown this was by far the
worst card to disassemble we've ever
worked with so you can see they solder
these massive cables on for the power
and that's how they can extend the power
over here because there's no PCB over
there and those are like roped through
part of the baseplate and then there's
screws and plastic security clips in
there to hold it all together
you've got that cable that's like kind
of difficult to plug back in later
because you're tethered over here so
anyway that's all the same and the GPU
is the same the board looks very similar
but I can't see the MOSFETs and I really
don't want to do this it'll be an hour
of work just to get it apart on the 26
the FE the cable here was also looped
around a plastic holder it was glued in
place he's using a lot of glue for these
cards and anyway it's basically the same
if not exactly the same but we're not
gonna we have to finish the review
because it's like 12 hours before I'm
bar go left so I think when I call that
one
they haven't improved the Assembly of
the 2060 I guess is what we're really
learning here and I'm gonna have to get
thermocouples in there without
disassembling it which will probably
take just as long as if I disassembled
it but I remember one of the Nvidia guys
saying why are these screws different
sizes he doesn't say that that's what
I'm saying they didn't say that to be
clear I don't hand video guys saying
that uh I would like be happy about
something or like something with the
card and I'm still not sure
if he meant like physically the card or
not so I kind of want to take it apart
to see if that's what they meant so for
now it looks like the board's the same
but the really important part here as
you can see we're still held together by
cables just like the original 20 60 is
what I complained about for like 30
minutes in that video is the assembly of
this and the reason is because just to
replace the thermal paste which is the
most basic possible thing it's extra
steps with like just just for the vanity
of getting this on that side instead of
the middle of the card that's what this
is all over it's this stupid thing if
they put it here it wouldn't be a
problem so if you want to replace your
paste on this you have to go through
extra steps of disconnecting this from
here which is not horrible but is very
annoying and then the kind of horrible
part is rerouting everything you're
probably gonna leave the secure clamps
out when you reassemble it because they
suck to put back in and then getting
this cable back into that socket is also
a challenge so anyway that's the same so
that's it for the teardown
cu1o 6-4 10 thanks just a Ponzi for the
recommendation that's that's the cards
2070 super is a 2080 basically I mean in
terms of physical Hardware it is a bit
different in the specs but physically
this board will fit 2080 water blocks
and the 2060 still sucks to disassemble
I'm probably going to end up doing the
rest of it anyway because I will have to
do it for a thermal couple placement but
I don't not looking forward to it still
have a gripe against that design that
will cover it though check her review
for full details on how the cards
actually perform and again they were all
tested before disassembly that's what we
do here so if you had concerns you don't
need to the testing is complete except
for the VR I'm thermal testing which
obviously requires this step thank you
for watching subscribe for more we go to
store dock here in Texas dotnet to pick
up the toolkit or the mod mat that I
worked on here we have a medium one as
well or patreon.com/scishow gamers extra
behind-the-scenes videos we'll see you
all next time
