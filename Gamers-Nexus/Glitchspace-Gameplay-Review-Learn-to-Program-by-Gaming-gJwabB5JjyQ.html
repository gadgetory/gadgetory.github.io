Nexus and today I'll be showing you
glitch space glitch space is a puzzle
game developed by space budgie that uses
a node based programming system this
system requires players to create
programs to progress through levels well
this sounds incredibly intimidating the
game is designed to introduce
programming to players I came into
glitch space with no programming
experience and I found the game
challenging but not so much that I
wanted to quit in the game players are
put in a cyberspace world where they
must find a place known as glitch space
players must navigate through levels by
exploiting glitches glitches are easy to
spot and are in the form of red bricks
that well glitch using null players are
shown the program that creates an item
or area and they must create a program
that allows them to move forward in the
beginning players are given programs
that are mostly complete and require
little alteration as players progress
through levels they are only given nodes
and must create programs from scratch
take this area for instance pulling up
null shows us a complete program that
has only one item that can be changed
with only one node on the right to
choose from creating the correct program
to move forward is very simple now we're
faced with the exact same situation but
instead of a complete program we have an
empty area in null using the nodes on
the right we have to create a program
from scratch with a working example
right behind me I chose to use this as
my guide to create what I thought would
be a working program for my fellow
non-programmers this is where logic and
guesswork become your best friends the
good news is if you create a nonworking
program and like me decide to test it
which space does have checkpoints
falling off the map won't set you back
too far and doesn't reset your programs
everything up until the program that
doomed you will still exist for those of
you who are programmers this game might
be easy so a sandbox mode is available
sandbox gives you all nodes available at
all times letting you program your way
through the game any way you can which
space is currently in alpha but can only
be played in story mode it is available
on Windows Linux and Mac OS X and is
tentatively set for a full release in
quarter 2 of 2014 check the links below
to find out where you can find the
glitch space alpha and let us know what
you think in the comments I'll be
bringing you more indie game coverage in
the future so keep an eye out for me
Dino pillow at gamers Nexus net I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
