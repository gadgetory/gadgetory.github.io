the MSI booth they've got a few things
that are new one of them is actually
pretty cool worth looking at it is the
Phantom pro laptop I will be taking that
apart in this video so we can take a
look at their exclusive cooler booth
three technology which taking it apart
will let us see what that exactly is and
this video before getting to the content
is brought to you by ifixit.com you go
to I finca calm and use code gamers
nexus for five dollars off we will be
using the iPad pro tech tool kit for
this video so that stated let's start
with the new stuff on the desktop side
before we get to the laptop new stuff is
where to go this is camo stuff so this
is a 1060 this is a Z 270 board for some
reason they have actually bolted this
down because I guess with digital camo
print that has been plastered to the
chipset heatsink the i/o shield and the
vrm he thinks is so highly desirable so
they didn't want it to walk away there
is a 1060 card just as a camo on the
left side there's a laptop as well it's
a GE 62 laptop which we've reviewed in
the past is a non camo it's the same
thing obviously so that's new i guess i
don't know what the price differences
but it will exist and that will be in a
limited quantity so hot i guess if you
really want to look out for it otherwise
let's move on to the phantom per hour so
we can take that apart and see what the
truly new stuff looks like inside and
now we're looking at msi is that new
laptop the msi phantom pro i haven't
seen this one at a show before so it's
my first time Cena if you want the model
number it's GS 43b r 7 r e this one has
a gtx 1060 in it and for a cpu it's got
a 7700 HQ which is fox news 2.8
gigahertz just natively stock out of the
box for the unit it is a small units
part of the cell family you can see it's
a bit skinnier but unlike the assault
unit that is here behind me it's also
not quite as 6 so that's your main
difference is just the width of the
laptop we're going to take this one
apart because
the card for this phantom laptop says
that it has I don't know exclusive
cooler boost 3 technology so we're going
to see exactly what that is and other
than that it's another laptop that's
really small so that's always cool to
look at but let's go ahead and take this
apart and see what's inside and I fix it
ends up it has sort of an unintentional
sponsor for the show in a great tool
kits if you haven't seen our ads on
before you can use coach gamers Nexus
has a link in the description below that
will give you five dollars off one of
their tool kids okay so getting in was
not too hard at two four six eight
screws total one is hidden Kandra CD
warranty void if removed sticker what's
not a hole puncher through it you're
welcome SSI once you get through it
looks like it's actually pretty easy
lives how to maintain compared to 10
weeks to have had zip hold a keyboard
off in the past to get the things like
memory which is really annoying this has
got both of its memory slots as to that
I'm aware of there might be more but two
right here that are easy access those
have six pre-installed there's an m2
nvme SSD towards the top based on the
current orientation card right below
that and then the GPU the cpu are both
located on this side of the board so you
don't have to remove the one back plates
get there and the rest of it is all
hooked up in here as well the battery is
located within the same panel it can be
disconnected and separately removed but
it's not easy to remove like some of the
larger laptop where it's just exposed
now as for this exclusive cooler boost
technology that comes down to the
blacked-out heat pipes so these are just
painted black or copper heatpipes paint
it out and it's 123 I think it's five
total heat pipes just looking at this
and
it looks like a few of them maybe two
are eight or ten millimeter looks like
eight and then the rest are six
millimeter heat pipe nothing too special
there it's two fans do blower style fans
so they are radial and that's really
pretty standard for a laptop and then
those are on either end so your heat
sinks to that end goes into a really
tiny set of fins which actually I can
show you those as well so the fins are
at the back here where it's exhausting
that's where your heats going fans
dissipating it pretty straightforward
not too different from what we've seen
in the past as laptops but this is the
Phantom laptop this is a new one from
MSI they've got their camo stuff as well
as we already showed probably less focus
on that because the one is limited
edition and two it's the same stuff just
with a camo digital prints on it phantom
further we'll look at that in the future
hopefully thank you for watching as
always thank you do i fix it for giving
us a kit so we could actually do this
