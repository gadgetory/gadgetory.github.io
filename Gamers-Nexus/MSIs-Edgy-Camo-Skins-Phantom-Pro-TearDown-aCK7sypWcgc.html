the msi booth they've got a few things
that are new one of them is actually
pretty cool worth looking at it is the
Phantom Pro laptop I will be taking that
apart in this video so we can take a
look at their exclusive cooler boost 3
technology which taking it apart will
let us see what that exactly is and this
video before getting to the content is
brought to you by ifixit.com you go to I
fix calm and use code gamers nexus for 5
dollars off we will be using the eye fix
of the protec toolkit for this video so
that stated let's start with the new
stuff on the desktop side before we get
to the laptop the new stuff is where to
go it's this camo stuff so this is the
1060 this is a z2 70 board for some
reason they have actually bolted this
down because I guess like the digital
camo print that has been plastered to
the chipset heatsink the IO shield and
the VRM heatsink is so highly desirable
that they didn't want it to walk away
there the 1060 card just has a camo on
the left side there's a laptop as well
it's a ge62 laptop which we've reviewed
in the past with a non camo it's the
same thing obviously so that's new I
guess I don't know what the price
difference is but it will exist and that
will be in a limited quantity so I guess
if you really want it look out for it
otherwise let's move on to the phantom
pro so that we can take that apart and
see what the truly new stuff looks like
inside and now we're looking at MSI is a
new laptop the MSI phantom pro I haven't
seen this one at a show before so it's
my first time seeing it if you want the
model number its GS 43 BR 7r e this one
has a GTX 1060 in it and for CPU it's
got a 7700 HQ which is clocked to 2.8
gigahertz just natively stock out of the
box for the unit it is a small unit it's
part of the stealth family so you can
see it's a bit skinnier but unlike the
stealth unit that is here behind me it's
also not quite as thick so that's your
main difference is just the width of the
laptops we're going to take this one
apart because
the card for this phantom laptop says
that it has I don't know
exclusive cooler boost three technology
so we're gonna see exactly what that is
and other than that it's it's another
laptop that's really small so that's
always cool to look at but let's go
ahead and take this apart and see what's
inside and I fix it ends up as sort of
an unintentional sponsor for the show
they make great toolkits if you haven't
seen our ads for them before you can use
code gamers nexus at the link in the
description below that'll give you five
dollars off one of their toolkits okay
so getting in was not too hard it's two
four six eight screws total one is
hidden under the warranty void if
removed sticker which now has a hole
puncture through it you're welcome to
FSI once you get through it looks like
it's actually a pretty easy laptop to
maintain compared to ones where we have
had to pull the keyboard off in the past
to get to things like memory which is
really annoying this has got both of its
memory slots as to that I'm aware of
there might be more but two right here
that are easy access those have six
pre-installed there's an MDOT two nvme
SSD towards the top based on its current
orientation hard drive below that and
then the GPU of the CPU are both located
on this side of the board so you only
have to remove the one backplate to get
there and the rest of it is all hooked
up in here as well the battery is
located within the same panel it can be
disconnected and separately removed but
it's not easy to remove like some of the
larger laptops where it's just exposed
now as for this exclusive cooler boost
technology that comes down to the
blacked out heat pipes so these are just
painted blacks or copper heat pipes
painted out and it's one two three I
think it's five total heat pipes just
looking at this and
it looks like a few of them maybe to our
eight or ten millimeter looks like eight
and then the rest are six millimeter
heat pipes nothing too special there
it's two fans two blower four style fans
so they are radial and that's really
pretty standard for a laptop and then
those are on either end so your heat
sinks to that end goes into a really
tiny set of fins which actually I can
show you those as well so the fins are
at the back here where it's exhausting
that's where your heats going fans
dissipating it pretty straightforward
not too different from what we've seen
in the past with laptops but this is the
phantom laptop this is the new one from
MSI they've got their camo stuff as well
as we already showed probably less focus
on that because one it's limited edition
and two it's the same stuff just with a
camo digital print on it
phantom pro there we'll look at that in
the future hopefully thank you for
watching as always thank you to iFixit
for giving us a kit so we could actually
do this check the links in description
