CPU the delay was caused by low supply
it was impossible to get the CPU for
about a month time forcing us ultimately
to resort to ebay and pay extra for a
new in box g4 560 of course immediately
after buying it it's now available for
$70 on most retailers finally and since
that return in stock the penny mg 45 60
is the next closest thing to Intel's
predecessor at three to five eight that
performed so well in its price class
however briefly that may have been today
we're reviewing it reverses a couple of
I 3s and mid-range
CPUs before getting to those that this
coverage is brought to you by EVGA and
they're 1080p is c2 which we've
recommended fairly highly for its build
quality and the icx sensors which are
kind of fun to play with you can check
our full SC 2 review for the 1080i if
you're curious to learn more or you can
click the link in the description below
to find the product page for the 1080i
sc2 the Intel Pentium a g4 560 is a $70
CPU that operates at 3.5 gigahertz with
no turbo support it's a fixed clock for
the CPU it's also got a weaker IGP in it
then the i3 counterparts but we're kind
of ignoring that because we don't care
about the IGP anyway aside from those
changes
it's a KP Lake CPU it sockets into
modern K V Lake boards anything that
supports KBL support the g4 560 and the
CPUs frequency is about 11% slower than
something like an i3 7100 but the price
is significantly different so we're at
70 for the 45 60 and this trait
somewhere and 120 for the 70 100 $150
seventy three hundred and we'll just
kind of in our tests we have the i3 6300
from last gen which we paid $145 for
from retailers so this is a
significantly cheaper product 70 bucks
that's similar to the g3 two five eight
in terms of price point the three two
five eight had a very short lived period
of shining on the charts and then after
that it kind of faded because of limited
thread count and things like that but it
was a good chip the 4560 looks like it
could be the next one of those it is
poised to battle with Intel's own eye
three line where Intel is already
engaged in battle in the i5 versus r5
Department and the i7 verse r7 division
so at the low end they're actually
competing with themselves more than
anyone else at this point so we're gonna
be looking at the g4 560 today versus VI
3 6300 the 73 is DK will have some
mid-range CPUs in there as well
everything will be in the charts for
testing methodology as always including
all of the platforms used for testing
the memory speeds all that stuff check
the link in the description below for
the full article as written by Patrick
Lathan but let's start with something
easy we're going to look at power drop
measured from the wall this is total
system power draw under stock
configurations unless otherwise noted
under no workload at all we measured in
idle power job 44 watts placing the four
560 below all the other CPUs we've
recently tested which makes sense it's
not a performance part with blender
multi-threaded workloads hammering all
the threads the bauer draw goes up to
about 67 watts from the wall Cinebench
puts us at 55 under single threaded
conditions with pov-ray
hovering at 58 watts under single
bearing conditions as well this is all
achievable thanks to roughly one volt on
the core which keeps power consumption
low and this is exceptionally power
efficient design which means that we
won't need a heavy-duty cooler for use
in real-world build as we've shown in
the article you can get along just fine
with a stock cooler and save even more
money off of the build by doing so for
temperature values see the article link
in the description below move on to
blender tests now you wouldn't exactly
be using a g4 560 for full bore blender
rendering tasks but just to provide a
baseline of non-gaming performance and
synthetics we decided to run the four
560 through a few tests anyway in
blender the four 560 completes our 4k
render scene as created by AG and Andrew
Coleman in about 110 minutes that puts
the 4 560 on par with the Phenom 2 X 6
1055 T and a bit slower than the i5 2500
k stock CPU because blender is more of a
thread intensive task this behavior
makes sense a four thread CPU or even
just a slower 6 threads GPU as indicated
by the phenom 2 setup is going to have
more trouble with rendering than the
more modern Rison or high-end
seven lineups for what it's worth the i3
6300 completed the same render in 100
minutes roughly 10% ahead of the 45 60
that's the advantage of a faster clock
on the 6300 and is about where you would
see the 7170 300 land as well
referencing Cinebench just for a
baseline prior to gaming benchmarks to
tool put to intel's pentium d 4 560 at
the bottom of the chart for
multi-threaded performance scoring 386
cv marks whereas the single threaded
test had its scoring at 150 cv marks the
i3 6300 for reference operated 9% faster
than the 45 60 at 422 cv marks and a
point 3 percent faster in single
threaded performance that makes sense
again given the clock they've rinse that
pretty much falls right in line with
that and for more reference points the
i3 72 50k stock CPUs scored 467 cv marks
or a 21 percent lead over the four five
sixty as gained by spending an extra
$100
moving on to gaming benchmarks watchdogs
two places the Intel Pentium g4 560 at
around 53 FPS average with 1% lows at 42
and GM 0.1% lows at 37 FPS average
considering we're operating with high
settings this isn't too bad we've got a
watchdogs to tuning guide for geometry
reductions to help save on performance
anyway but we're also not testing in a
vacuum versus the Intel i3 6300 which we
purchased last year for $145 the for 560
is nearly equal in performance it's a
difference of about 2% in average FPS we
don't have the i3 70 100 or 7300 but the
i3 6300 is only a few percentage points
different from those and the $120 i3 70
100 clocks of 3.9 gigahertz making it 11
percent faster and frequencies on the
3.5 gigahertz 45 60 the i3 7300 clocks
at 4.0 and costs $150 so it's a
completely different price bracket to be
fair the 7300 also has an extra megabyte
of cache but it's also again 2 times the
cost of the 4 560 regardless we do have
the 72 50k stock CPU with a higher base
and boost and that one holds the lead of
about 25% over the one third to cost g4
560 that's because the 72 50k has a
higher base and it boosts and it's 170
dollars so kind of a differ
price bracket again not really worth it
for the 1750 K but it was a good idea to
do a case ui3 anyway for 560 with a
thigh 360 300 matching performance it
looks to be a good deal so far this is
somewhat reminiscent of the three to
five eight but better it is a challenger
to intel's own i three market with
performance levels comparable to a 2500
k just for some perspective will
highlight the i5 7500 and r5 1500 x
respectively these chips run averages
that are 52 percent and 39 percent
faster than the four 560 that said if
you're going to be on a tight budget
where high-end that GPS are not possible
gains aren't actually going to matter
until a point where the GPU becomes
powerful and i'll push into a bottleneck
territory anyway let's look at total or
warhammer keep in mind that total war
Warhammer receives an update back during
our rise and revisit improving the games
frame time performance and consistency
on both Intel TVs and rise in CPUs only
the line items with asterisks have thus
far been updated so we need to rerun
that some of the lower and Intel CPUs
that said the difference in average is a
couple percent at best this update was
really something that primarily affected
0.1% low performance and AMD Azzam T
performance that made clear the Intel
Pentium g4 560 operates at 109 FPS
average in total war Warhammer with the
two lows at 64 we are approaching the
performance levels of the i3 6300 CTU at
114 average and 66 fps 1% lows with the
i3 6300 running about 4.6 percent faster
than the four 560 despite its initial
cost of $145 by 370 170 300 performs
similarly to the 6300 with a couple
percent gain on these 7300 Intel i3 7250
case boxy few operates an average frame
rate of about 122 FPS
leading the 4 560 by about 12% in
performance and leading by that 2.5
times in price again with this game as
long as you're not going to be running a
GPU of $200 plus class anyway there's
not a huge concern of bottlenecking with
the 4 560 playing GTA 5 at 1080p and
with very high and ultra settings the
Intel Pentium at four 560 operates an
average FPS of 101 with GN 1% lows at 72
and 0.1
settlers at 66 FPS this leads the CPU to
be flanked by the FX 80 to 70 and i-5
2500 k stock CPUs with the g4 560 mostly
tied to the ladder and outperforming the
former by 7.9 percent the more skew
comparable i3 6300 meanwhile runs an
average FPS of 112 with one percent lows
at 80 and 0% loads at 73 the 6300 is
about 11.5 percent faster than the 45 60
here and is showing some meaningful
games in this particular game the AI 372
DK for what it's worth it runs its
average stock at 121 fps leading the 45
60 by 20% in performance requiring the
AI 317 to K doesn't appear on this chart
because it encounters the same GTA 5
bugs that we've been profiling
throughout the first quarter of the year
finally a battlefield 1 will round out
our testing for the video with the rest
of the benchmarks taking place in the
article linked to a description below
then tell Pentium 4 560 is able to
handle our battlefield one test at 112
FPS average but keep in mind that the 64
slot servers with a large amount of
actors near the player will linearly
drive the numbers down ultimately we're
just looking at deltas between parts
anyway so 112 that puts us fairly close
to the i-5 2500 k stock CPU again ahead
of the FX 83-70 and puts the i3 6300
about 7.7 percent ahead of the pentium g
4 560 these gains for the i3 s it would
be reasonable except the price makes it
sort of a tough argument price jumps of
$50 minimum $70 for the sixty three
hundred and seventy three hundred lines
and gains of under 10% meme it's a hard
sell considering someone in this price
bracket is on a tight budget
anyway the 50 or $70 gains would better
go toward other components like the GPU
maybe an SSD or something like that the
takeaway here is that this is a great
CPU for budget class gaming it is
reminiscent of the g3 2 5 8 for those
who remember that chip
hopefully it'll hold on a bit longer but
the 4 560 competes most directly with
Intel's own GPUs that would be the i3
you're gaining a couple percent in FPS
maybe depends on the game with something
like an i3 70 100 or 70 300 or 6300
which we did test even the Soviets you
hit DK it posts bigger gains but it's
$100 more expensive so this is kind of
in a class of its own the 4 or 5
if you're looking for a CPU that is
capable of playing games reasonably
again these were all at high settings or
ultra settings so it can definitely play
the games if you're looking for
something really cheap this is a good
place to start the four five sixty you
do not need an i3 any more to play games
at a reasonable frame rate 60fps as long
as you've got a good GPU so you can get
away with this now it is going to show a
is a bit faster in the Department of
things like frame time consistency
that's something we've seen for the i5s
it will be true for the Pentiums as well
however you're still going to get a good
amount of mileage out of this I I
hesitate to put a number on it but
you're looking at at least a year or two
that's kind of where the three to five
eight started to fade was after about
one to two years there were some brand
new games that stressed it to a point
where it was really unadvisable to
inadvisable tease apart so the 4560 will
hold on for a while if you're not doing
anything really crazy it should hold on
quite a while this is something that you
could put into a machine and later
remove and upgrade to a different cpu if
you so chose to do that and perhaps move
it into something like an aged CPC later
so you're still getting use out of the
part for a machine that's not doing any
intensive gaming so this is a good place
to look I threes don't really feel all
that necessary anymore it heavily says
lot of them donkeys making pennies like
this which they are hit and miss on but
the four or five sixty is something we
recommend over most of the i3s like the
$150 plus ones that make really a
diminishing amount of sense with Rison
and with the i-5 parts being so close in
price so it's kind of g4 560 and then
i-5 class territory or r5 class
territory then after that you've got
your normal ice evans and our seven so
my choices would be today g4 560 at the
budget range you go to the middle kind
of lookin like something like an r5 1600
we recommended that in our review of the
1600 X the 16 hundreds basically the
same thing so that's a good place to
look for an i-5 type CPU that we think
will hold on a bit better based on our
testing that we published in the review
this
600k is still good chip but the r5s do
give it a run for its money so Andy's
get there and then at the top end the
7700 K is still the best in gaming hands
down
it is uncontested in the pure gaming
build market right now so G for 560 are
fives PI sevens is kind of what we're
looking at as always thank you for
