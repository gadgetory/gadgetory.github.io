at MSI's factory in shenzhen china we
also found some unique testing and
assembly machinery for motherboards each
motherboard SMT line in this Factory is
121 metres long would be combined 10
lines responsible for producing 1.6
million motherboards per month
although the SMT line works on the same
principles and machines of any other SMT
line there are a few unique steps that
stand out for MSI factory like the
robotic in circuit testing and
semi-automated system building tools in
this video we'll walk through just some
of MSI's overwhelmingly large
motherboard and video card Factory in
China before that this video is brought
to you by be quiet and it's straight
power 11 series power supplies the
straight power 11 PSU is shipped from
450 Watts up to a thousand Watts
accommodating most of the gaming PC
build requirements you'd encounter and
focuses on delivering a higher quality
power supply that doesn't sacrifice on
efficiency or stability noise is also a
heavy point for the straight power 11
using a 135 millimeters silent wins
three fan that can spin as low as 200
rpm for quieter low load operation learn
more at the link in the description
below one of the most interesting tools
in an SMT line is the in circuit tester
or ICT where motherboards are checked
for defects at the end of the service
mount line at gigabytes factory in
circuit testing was largely a manual
process with technicians checking the
board's at a special station at the very
end of the SMT lines MSI also used to do
it this way and still does at some
stations but has recently started moving
toward more automation ICT machines
check for defects like solder shorts bad
soldering by the machines missing
components sort of like an alternative
approach to optical inspection or Aoi
automatic optical inspection and
tombstoning of components which is when
small surface mount devices might start
lifting off from the solder pads to
machines sit at the end of each SMT line
each with two motherboard carriers the
machine is equipped with suction cups
that grab the board off of the line
while the other board is removed by the
arm automatically from the ICT machine
the new board is then loaded into the
ICT machine with digital displays
representing whether the machine is
holding weight or not if the board's
past
fed down the line to manual quality
checking technicians as for what the
motherboard is placed on there's a
custom CNC plate for every single
motherboard model that has to be seated
on the top of the ICT machine the plate
helps mask which pins are and aren't
exposed to the board with those making
contact used for testing the board like
for a simple continuity for a common
example 95% of all pins on the
motherboard are tested with this device
often upwards of 1,800 pins total per
board and 100% of all motherboards go
through these machines MSI also has a
custom-built motherboard tester that
uses semi-automated processes it's sort
of like automatic PC assembly although a
few and pieces of imports are missing
the lower deck is for supporting the
motherboard the upper deck is for the
CPU cooler the memory in the video card
and then the rear i/o including one
cable for every single port on the board
this is all pre wired into a carrier and
when the technician starts the machine
the upper deck automatically lowers and
sockets the RAM the video card and the
CPU cooler all into the motherboard in
one button press the buttons on the
machine are labeled top to bottom as
start turn on carrier support plate and
ascend which should have a pretty
obvious usefulness although not fully
automatic these buttons are most of
what's needed to get things started the
rear i/o also pulls forward through
automatic connection of all the cables
to the motherboard
which prepares the board for software
testing to ensure that each of these
outputs works the back of the machine is
how you know that this is a functional
solution it's probably one of those
things that's built once and then
hopefully rarely or never messed with
the blue tubes run to each moving parts
of the rig with air pressure used to
move the plates around the cables have
to be manually connected based upon the
board which adds some manual work but
only on the front end since one type of
board is tested for most or all of the
day and this saves more time than it
ends up costing at the beginning of the
day once everything is hooked up the
motherboards are run through automatic
software testing to ensure everything
works tests include PCIe bandwidth
testing line-in lineout other audio
tests front-end front out audio memory
SATA
platform module tests LAN and anything
else that communicates through the board
which is basically everything RGB LEDs
are used to illustrate various states of
passage or failure throughout the
testing and technicians can bend the
board's aside if they need to go to QC
any boards that fail are sent to quality
checking for inspection on the same
floor and then after that it's sent from
the QC team to a team that manually
fixes the defects often by hand with
soldering irons MSI splits its tests
between real-world and synthetic tests
with function testing represented by
most of what we just showed real-world
testing goes through an operating system
BIOS changes some performance testing
Network testing and burn ins this test
runs about 20 minutes long with the
automated testing taking only 5 to 10
minutes as for some of the other
manufacturing processes we'll walk
through a few of the more interesting
steps or Emma sighs SMT lines
motherboards SSDs Ram video cards and
most other devices with PCBs will go
through an SMT line at some point so
these are not unique to MSI they're
really not unique at all we saw one at
Kingston in 2012 we've already detailed
the start to finish SMT line process in
our gigabyte factory tour but each
factory has a few unique elements that
allow them to do things differently one
of the steps we've explained before is
the solder paste the machine which is
often the first step in any SMT line
solder paste is applied through a screen
applied to every area of the PCB where a
component will be mounted via
pick-and-place machines later and this
is eventually refloat to secure the
components to the board by going through
an oven MSI showed us one of its silk
screens for the export 70 gaming Pro
carbon use the guide solder paste
placement when these machines are used
one of the other new machines to our
channel was the pick-and-place machine
specifically tooled for chokes most
factories we've toured use manual labour
for choke placement but this Factory had
one machine that does the work of three
operators multiplied across ten
motherboard lines and five video card
lines that's a lot fewer people required
to make the board and for the company
that is helpful because we're told that
apparently manpower in Shenzhen is
getting difficult to come by people just
don't want to do it anymore
the machines can play six jokes at a
time and complete most boards in about
twenty seconds total time memory slot
power connectors SATA connectors and
other large components like vrm heat
sinks are still placed by hand some of
these it's because it's difficult for
the machines to grasp them other ones
it's because it's just heavy and would
be faster to do by hand than by tooling
a machine for it
a weighted block is placed at top things
like memory slots to keep them as secure
as the board goes through another reflow
machine because the vibrations from the
belt could otherwise knock it loose
although insignificant in the scope of
this video this small step does show the
attention to detail required for every
single step of the process of making a
complicated product like a motherboard
the lake of solder makes another
appearance in this line just like the
last one we saw but we did get some more
information on them as the boards move
down the conveyor belts and get dipped
in solder the solder has topped off by
bricks of solid solder that gets it into
the lake the brick lowers on its own
over time it's hung from a hook and it
melts in the 270 degrees Celsius at Lake
below it it takes about three hours for
one solder brick to be completely
depleted on a line with each motherboard
using about 7 grams of solder on its own
we also looked again at the
pick-and-place machine that plants
sockets onto the boards we've previously
reported that gigabyte saves large
components like sockets for the end of
its production line but we didn't 100%
know what MSI does the same and our
understanding now is that it's easier to
move the board through the line and keep
it stable during other pick-and-place or
soldering steps which might rock the
board of it the sockets are checked for
bent pins before exiting the machines
using a an optical inspector that MSI
has worked to customize its automatic it
takes functionally a picture of the
socket and then is able to find any bent
pins or other defects
despite being protected some of these
are duds one source from the supplier
we're told about 0.2% have bent pins
from the supply factory
another unique step done by MSI is its
additional photography step and this is
the one that might get you in trouble if
you ever are me aboard
so what MSI does is they have a as part
of the line there's a camera that's
hooked up that takes really
high-resolution photos of the front of
the board if you were to RMA the board
at some point and there's maybe a set
missing capacitors or something when MSI
gets the board back they'll compare the
board against the original reference
photo and see if something went wrong
this is ideally used to figure out if
something was wrong at the factory when
it went out so it can then be tracked
down to the machine and that machine can
be fixed alternatively if you do try to
pull one over theoretically they would
be able to find out so it's got two
purposes there but of course who's to
say if something happened in shipping
before it got to you
so that's MSI is part of it the
motherboard factory you can check our
other video on there socket well GPU
tester and you can check our video in
gigabytes at some tea line if you want
the full start to finish details on what
every machine in this line does thanks
