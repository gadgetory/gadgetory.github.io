extreme to see if ZOTAC has redeemed
themselves with this new card this card
is one of the biggest on the market
taking nearly three slots cooling with
three fans and using the biggest
heatsink we've yet seen on a 1080 Ti the
unit is also priced at roughly 750 to
$770 and so you think that'd be pretty
good at cooling but we'll see how that
goes throughout the testing this testing
will be largely focused on thermals and
noise because again all the 1080p eyes
really have about the same gaming
performance before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by our
patreon supporters you can help out by
going to patreon.com/scishow more Nexis
and checking out the pledge rewards and
options or you can go to store docking
Razak to scott net to pick up a shirt
and again thank you to our readers who
occasionally send us loaner hardware for
review so here it is the zotac 1080 TI
amp extreme again want to be largest
that we've reviewed the only one that
comes closer is more or less equal to it
is that the gigabyte card that we have
here the extreme Oris card they're about
the same width the zotac card is longer
its heavier and is competitive in terms
of slot requirements which is almost
three at this point so it's a big card
and all that space is really allocated
to this aluminum heatsink it's a large
heatsink will measure the thermals and
things like that in a moment and then
the rest being the shroud as far as the
external areas of the card go is a three
fan cooler and these are synchronously
controlled it's not a synchronous fan
control they have six heat pipes
underneath with five of them protruding
out of the right side of the card facing
it and then one of them routes through
the left half of the heatsink for LEDs
and effects the card has one in the back
plate for the zotac branding which
lights up with a digital LED so you can
get a more fluid transition color to
color and there are also digital LEDs on
the top and bottom and then one in the
top nameplate and then you've got the
geforce gtx branding on the top of the
card which is a requirement by nvidia
the only people who've gotten around
doing this that we've seen
is ASIS with their Strix ROG card which
actually we have right here because the
asu's card has a sticker that you can
peel off but it says GeForce GTX on it
so I guess they bypass the rules a bit
but that's the outside of the detect
card in terms of the core specs
it's a 1080p eye they're all the same in
terms of gaming performance out of box
even with pre overclocked so what you're
left with is the cooling solution and
the noise and then I suppose the power
solution for the power solution on this
they are using two eight pins for the
input and then it's a technically it's a
double eight phase-- using a u p9 v one
one controller in a phase mode that's
doubling and going to basically a
sixteen phase format with fourteen of
those where the vrm normally is and then
the other two phase is in the bottom
right of the card kind of under their
own heatsink separately speaking of the
vrm it's got its own heatsink it's a
small aluminum thin stack it is not
connected to a base plate so they've
done that differently on this card from
the others there's no base plate on any
part of the card
it's just PCB screwed into the heatsink
with the separate vrm he's sinking that
vrm heatsink has on top of it a rubber
bumper pad which is theoretically used
for noise damping but is completely
pointless because with a card this large
and with three fans spinning out the
lower rotational speeds that they're
spending that you really shouldn't have
any vibration and we didn't even when we
remove the pad so that's pointless but
the rubber bumper could be used to help
prevent the thin stack from flexing as
much in the event that the user applies
undue force during installation which is
probably the more likely used since the
pad doesn't actually make contact any
part of the card when it's left
undisturbed that's our photos show the
pad does not contact the chokes so isn't
used for coil one reduction and instead
sits with a hair thickness gap between
the vrm heatsink and the padded aluminum
heatsink underbelly but that covers the
basics of the cooling solution the rest
is a copper cold plate from the GPU and
then an aluminum cold plates for the
vram which sinks into the same aluminum
thin stack as everything else let's get
into the testing as always you can find
the testing methodology in the article
link of the description below we are
focusing on the thermals and the noise
for this one and we're also doing a
noise normalised test at 40 DBA for all
the cards that we've benchmarked so far
with this method where you can look at
the thermal results versus the fixed 40
DBA noise output starting with a stock
thermals chart we see that the 10 atti
at extreme card operates it's GPU
temperature reasonably around the 66
Celsius mark and that's when under Auto
conditions by the way basically out of
box look at 40 DBA testing in a moment
but this auto configuration also places
the card's power component temperatures
in the 90s nearing 100 C with a steady
state temperature of 95 Celsius the new
RAM is around 81 Celsius steady-state
before getting to the comparative charts
here's a look at one of our GN EQ charts
basically a steady-state to show the
thermals under various test conditions
overclocked our GPU temperatures remain
steady when operating at a fixed rpm so
we're soaking the extra 20 percent power
and plus 50 megahertz core pretty well
and the vram increases by about to see
from our plus 400 megahertz PM
overclocked not bad
the vrm components however are pushing
up to 98 Celsius external temperature
from the measurement we're taking and
that's with a 22 to 23 salties ambience
with one 120 millimeter fan providing
airflow over the back plate if you put
this card in a case it would not be
unreasonable to see a 40 Celsius
internal ambient temperature which was
boost the vrm temperatures into the
range of 110 + Celsius now a few
reminders here just like with EVGA ACX
card this is technically within spec
ZOTAC isn't breaking any specifications
here it is running hot though and the
thin is even though you're technically
within spec under 95 Celsius for vram
and under 125 maybe 150 Celsius on the
BRM depending on which component you're
looking at even given that condition it
doesn't mean it's okay it's run so hot
and the reason is because this card is
massive they have all of this area to
provide cooling and get rid of the heat
that's generated by the components and
they can't outperform something that is
almost half its size about an inch
smaller
in terms of just the cooler alone or
even the sc2 card the EVGA sc2 card or
even the founders edition card the vrm
is running hotter on this and no they're
not the same vrm components of course
that's a big part of it but the thing is
though TAC has the ability to correct
this it's just a matter of poor design
for the thermal solution and will kind
of show some of our own tests where we
fixed it somewhat with the hack job but
just something thermal pads basically
and got it working a bit better
so yes it's within spec but it's it's
not good it's too hot for the expensive
price 757 $70 really anything over 700
has no excuse for that kind of
performance and even the $700 MSI armor
card which by all accounts was an awful
card other than the PCB itself the
gaming ex PCB was it's one saving grace
for h2o it's worse than that card in
terms of thermal performance and getting
rid of the heat in the power component
areas and it's bit warm in the vram but
not nearly as bad as with power
comparatively to the other cards let's
get some perspective looking at other
devices on a steady state chart we're
now testing for thermals it with noise
normalized at 40 DBA output the MOSFET
chart positions the zotac app extreme
1080i so significantly hotter than the
other cards that it's actually
impressive that is it's impressive
they've managed to design a heatsink and
fan solution so bad at cooling that's
was one of the biggest cards on the
market this is a three fan cooler that
takes nearly 300 PCIe slots and somehow
it's managing a 70 mm delta T over
ambient power component temperature or
nearly a hundred Celsius if you ignore
that delta T over ambient bit that makes
this card 20 C hotter than the previous
worst card on the bench the 1080 TI
armor and the 1080i armor uses what is
effectively a 1070 cooler though it's a
bit buffed looking at 40 DB a VRAM
temperatures where we see a 58.3 Celsius
delta T over ambient temperature with
the 1080 TI armor still worse on this
particular charge this place is the app
extreme around where the gaming X and F
tw3 performed not
Prez Oh tack here but then again the
vram is cooled directly and actually
uses thermal pads to contact cooling
plate kind of hard to screw that up
it's more of a standard solution in that
department for vram so they've done well
at keeping that normal performance I
guess GPU temperatures at 40 DBA are
also somewhat reasonable with the amp
extreme at 42 Celsius delta T over
ambient this is around where the FT w3
and gigabyte extreme aureus cards
performed with the asus strix ROG card
still hanging on to the title for best
air cooled card we've tested so far the
next coolest are both under liquid so
then why do we see the high temperatures
we see with this card well a lot of it
is actually not the fans or the fan rpm
a lot of it is in fact the way the
cooling solution is handled right now
because this is a loner card we have to
send it back to its purchaser just a
reader like the rest of you or a viewer
and so we've done a mod for him where
we've replaced the original rubber
bumper that's in here on the vrm
components with thermal pads and those
help a decent amount as we'll see but
the reason that the temperatures are so
high to begin with is partly because of
that rubber bumper that just sits
between the large heatsink and the small
heatsink with one not actually any
contact between them so there's no
reason for it to be there and two it
should be a thermal pad where just like
a CX where EVGA overlooked or whatever
you forgot or cheap that on or whatever
they did to not put their own pads where
they now have them everywhere on the
board ZOTAC did not put their own pads
here so that's part of the problem the
next part of the problem is that ZOTAC
is using a backplate that ultimately
acts as something of a hotbox or a
thermal insulator and it helps trap some
of the heat which we've seen in the past
on some cards again EVGA ACX comes to
mind where when we added the thermal pad
to the back of the card between the
backplate and the PCB which is something
that UGA provided for free to make this
problem go away on their own devices
this card does not have a thermal pad
there so it's got the same kind of
problem where it's just trapping
he and in some areas that cause of
temperatures to spike we actually
removed the backplate for some future
testing in a moment and and saw an
improvement so those are part of the
reason that this card is running warm
the other just potentially being the
power design in general so let's look at
the thermal pad that we added on top of
the vrm heatsink just to see what the
difference looks like we actually had to
do this by stacking tooth they're all
pads because we didn't have a thick
enough unit in stock to actually put on
there there's limits performance since
you're now transferring between two
interfaces which means that our fix
so-called isn't even that good but it's
still better than what ZOTAC shipped
initially and they definitely have
access to better they're all pads than
we do the difference in power component
temperatures is an improvement of 7.1
Celsius moving from roughly ninety four
point eight C to eighty seven point
seven C using a better thermal pad or
just a single thermal pad would improve
that further and here's where it really
gets interesting if we remove the
backplate for the next pass with the
original rubber bumper on the BRM heat
sinks instead of that thermal pad and
with the fan fixed around forty-five
percent which is about what the auto
would give you for both benchmarks we
see that ZOTAC is incinerating its own
card with what amounts to a plastic
backplate or at least a plastic wrapped
back plate but the backplate removed the
GPU temperatures remain more or less the
same we're at a 2 C difference which is
still an improvement but not exciting
what is exciting though is that the
power component temperatures improve by
about 13 C that's 95 to 82 which is
completely reasonable for a B or M
temperature both are within spec but 82
is alongside what most of the other
cards perform at when they are in the 10
atti class so in terms of gaming
performance again all the 1080p is are
more or less the same once you get a
decent one that resolved the potential
thermal limitation of something like a
founders Edition card where you can
boost higher if you have a more
controlled GPU core temperature so
anything that's got an aftermarket
cooler that we've tested and shown to be
good the exception being something like
another blower cooler like the Aero
cards for example once you've gotten
into that class a better cooler they
really are all the same for gaming
performance for overclocking performance
they're mostly the same as well the
my time you start getting into a
difference is when you go kingpin class
or lightning class or something like
that and you get the extra switches to
disable limitations or you get the extra
clearance to add Ellen to pots without
having to rework the board those are a
different class of card and those can
certainly push higher more easily in the
overclocking department for these cards
the by out of box and used cards they
were they're about the same so we've
kind of ruled out gaming and
overclocking performance as a reason to
buy one card of the over the other what
you're left with is things like price
looks if that matters to you we're not
really going to comment on that and then
thermal and noise performance thermal
and noise performance the asus strix
is still hands down the best cooled card
in terms of noise output at 40 DBA
it performs better than everyone else
until you get into the liquid class and
it doesn't look like that's going to
change anytime soon unless we get our
hands on some other new advanced cards
that we don't have already so the zotac
card is not impressive enough to warrant
a purchase versus its nearby competition
which would be the 750 to 770 dollar
class so 770 you look at stuff like ft
w3 and asus rog Strix with the Strix
kind of leading in that class both of
them are a bit superfluous you're not
going to get a whole lot better out of
them other than really specific lower
noise performance if that matters to you
then perhaps they are worth considering
but then again so is liquid at that
point so you look at it so in $50 class
you start getting into the territory of
an FC to the icx version or some of the
gigabyte cards the gaming acts gaming
acts and the SE 2 are pretty good in the
$750 class they are the gaming acts
especially fairly quiet and they cool
better at least on the power component
temperatures then the zotac card does so
it's kind of hard to find a place for
this one you can make it better with
their own pad mods which we've kind of
done and we'll leave it that way and
ship it back to Josh with the thumb pad
mod on it but you're basically buying
for the looks at that point
do you like the digital RGB LEDs yes or
no there's your answer
of if you should buy this card it's not
the absolute worst thing that ZOTAC has
ever built but
it's also not that competitive with
other cards on the market given the
price and that's all for this one thank
