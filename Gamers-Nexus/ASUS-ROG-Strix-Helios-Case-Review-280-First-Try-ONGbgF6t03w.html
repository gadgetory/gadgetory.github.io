you know it's meant to be for land
because it has straps on the top of it
this is the Asus Helios ROG strikes case
it's a case that Asus showed at Computex
they originally worked with and when it
goes the other way they worked within
when originally to make the case and now
issues has struck out on its own to find
a factory to manufacture the strict
Helios case that we're reviewing today
it's a $280 case let's see how they did
before that this video is brought to you
by deep cool is captain 240 Pro
closed-loop liquid cooler the new
captain 240 pro comes with RGB
illuminated fans and a pump easily
synchronized to each other for color
matching in your system the captain 240
pro radiator also uses a unique elastic
pressure relief bladder in the water
tank as a leak prevention mechanism it
expands and contracts based upon liquid
temperature to counteract a IO leak
concerns the cooler is available now and
you can learn more at the link in the
description below so this is a pretty
complicated case for really what it is
it's expensive it's a high-end case it's
got bits of aluminum a lot of glass it
has a lot of steel and some plastic and
it also has four fans it has some velcro
and some straps on the top that are
meant for transporting the case although
really the best way to transport it at
this point is probably for me to lower
the table and then pick it up because
frankly if you're lifting above your
shoulders with this thing you're kind of
screwed anyway so the case is heavy it's
about 18 kilograms without anything in
it as you add stuff to it
it's heavier and that brings up the
point of liquid cooling because
something like this would be potentially
better suited for maybe an open-loop
setup although you'd have to pull a few
parts out and shuffle some stuff around
but it's an option it's not something
we're testing today we're just
you know for build quality for value
competitive placement in the market
thermally acoustically and looking at
how issues did collectively to pull this
thing together and see what points of
improvement there might be and what
points of what areas of the case they've
excelled in and there are a couple of
them so let's get into Patrick's build
notes and then we'll go through the
thermal section and the conclusions the
case is packed with as many features as
possible necessary or otherwise the most
distinctive is the velcro strap placed
over the top panel ostensibly an
ergonomic and stylish handle as issues
calls it for carrying the system to land
parties it helps a little bit for
hoisting the case up onto a table but
this is not the enclosure to bring to a
land party even for the rare person that
attends more than one per decade most of
the cases services glass and weighs 18
kilograms when empty at least the straps
and the rails that they've loop them
through our massive overkill tested up
to 50 kilograms according to Asus so the
most likely point of failure is the
person lugging it around the strap is
fastened with Velcro and can easily be
removed before it gets dusty and gross
and we'd recommend doing so since the
case looks perfectly normal without it
when we first received our sample the
quotes multifunction cover over the
cutouts to the side of the motherboard
was knocked sideways in a way that
looked like serious damage but
fortunately for us it was just loose
there was also a mysterious loose screw
wedged into it which we later discovered
was from the front panel so probably
some factory control should be looked
into for aces this is not typically
something we make a big deal to point
out but for a company that's just
starting up with this there might be
some inexperience coming into play here
the cover slides backwards and forwards
to allow room for EA TX motherboards and
it contains a two and a half inch drive
mount and built-in GPU brackets braces
provided for the GPU are of limited
usefulness since they mostly support the
edge of the GPU closest to the
motherboard which is already held up by
the PCIe slot the rails for the supports
are unpainted to allow the supports to
slide up and down and stand out harshly
against the black interior which is
something we think could be improved GPA
sag is a problem but it's one
an elegant solution ASIS did not provide
one here the cover functions normally
otherwise but offers very little
clearance for plugs on the edge of the
motherboard and connecting the SATA
cable for our boot drive was difficult
the cooler master style rear cable cover
is made of translucent plastic that's a
deliberate decision to allow lighting
from RGB SSDs to shine through while
still obscuring cables but it removes
even more of the purpose from a
component that we already aren't wild
about cable covers are good for hiding
cables behind clear glass there are also
okay for smashing down cable bundles so
that they don't push the side of the
path the panel itself off or make it
bulge out a clear plastic cover is worse
at both of those things than a metal one
would be another case feature familiar
to us from cooler masters H 500 cases is
the power supply shroud which is a full
length but can be removed in two
sections this also came from the 1/2 X
the front section slides back a little
to loosen it and then it lifts out but
ASIS missed a common trick here by not
drilling a couple more holes and
allowing users to screw the shroud down
with it pushed backwards the rear
section of the shroud has a plastic
window for viewing fancy power supply
cables and power supplies themselves iev
asus rog power supplies of course
underneath is a hard drive cage that can
be moved forward or backwards for extra
cable storage space as needed which is
one of the better features the side
panels are both removable with push
buttons which we've praised on other
cases in the past the panel swing out a
few degrees and then support their own
weight and can be lifted up and off it's
a good system but it's strange that Asus
chose not to use true hinges which is a
go-to for cases trying to prove how
premium they are like the SI 700 mm or
the Evolve X each of the two side panels
are tinted while the front panel is a
clear glass with a tinted plastic film
over the back it's possible that clear
glass is necessary for the LED lighting
which shines through the panel from one
side it illuminates the painted ROG
design which is cleverly biased towards
the side closer to the LEDs the stock
case fans don't have any lighting but
it's probably to avoid clashing with the
front panel illumination we didn't go
too into depth with the lighting effect
but they're smooth and even overall
can be controlled the button on the
front I Oh panel there's also a fan
control button but we almost never use
fan controllers for case benchmarks so
we don't bother with them the front
panel is intended to never be removed
and the manual goes so far as to give
instructions for cleaning the glass from
the inside of the case but it wasn't
really difficult to take it off in spite
of this and also as a side note we saw
this glass being made previously in our
Houghton perd glass is made a factory
tour taking out six screws and
unplugging the RGB cable it releases the
two pillars that hold the glass pane in
place and that's all it takes
the only ventilation for the front panel
is the top and the bottom with 2.5
centimeters between the filter in the
glass obviously that's not as good as it
would have been with a mesh panel but
maybe three intake fans is enough to
brute force airflow check the thermal
section coming up for that the filters
are nice the bottom one ejects from the
front of the case and the top one lifts
straight up if the velcro carry strap is
removed which it should be most of the
time the number of cables in the case
before anything that has even been
installed is above average the front i/o
panel includes four USB three plugs one
USB type-c an LED and a fan control
cable set as well as the normal audio
plugs and the power and reset buttons
the lighting and fans require SATA power
and there are three fans at the front of
the case with their own cables
pre-installed velcro straps behind the
motherboard make kale management fairly
easy anyway although we had to cut
through quite a few of the factory
installed zip ties to get things
arranged the way we wanted the front and
top of the case speech a removable
radiator mounts a feature we always like
but the front mount became hard to work
with when we installed the anoxia fans
for our standardized fantast knocked to
his fans you sleeved cables that are
thicker than normal and he's in 140
millimeter fans that leaves almost no
space along the side of the fan mount
for cables to go through and makes it
very difficult to slide the cage down
into place however since asus has fully
populated the front mounts with three
148 millimeter what 1400 RPM fans of its
own most users will probably never
replace that GPU installation this made
slightly more complicated by the
vertical GPU mount which is in set and
obstructs the screws for the expansion
slot covers two slot covers are held
down with thumb screws and the rest with
a normal case screws since there's not
enough room between them and the
vertical mount this actually is
a problem so if you put one of the
thumbscrews and one of the lower
expansion slots it will collide with the
vertical GPM out sort of a really odd
oversight to make to install a GPU
horizontally the vertical mount needs to
be removed completely and then replaced
afterwards the inconvenience is mostly
made up for with a replacement vertical
mount included in the accessory kit
which is adjustable in height for
different CPU and GPU cooler sizes and
mounts the GPU much closer to the
motherboard allowing significantly
better cooling this is a good thing
unfortunately there isn't a riser cable
included even at this price which is
again at odds with the amount of bells
and whistles asus has already packed in
elsewhere we did our usual thermal
testing and the Helios but also a couple
of extra tests like one without the
front panel and one with the GPU mounted
in the vertical slot but we use the slot
closest to the motherboard which is a
substantial difference than what you
would see if you mounted it against the
glass there are two options in this case
thermals we'll start with just the ACS
Helios on the charts then we'll move on
to comparative benchmarks against other
cases CV temperature average fifty four
point six degrees over ambient on the
stock torture test but dropped to forty
two point one degrees with the front
panel removed more front intake fans
means a more dramatic difference when
there's glass in front of them and it's
removed and that's an extreme drop in
temperature there's not a great way to
improve on the stock temperatures other
than liquid cooling unless you count
removing the glass which much wouldn't
Asus includes at four 140 millimeter
1,400 rpm fans leaving that little room
for improvement with just fan changes
that's both good and bad the good is
that Asus sets you up with one of the
best fan configurations out of the box
but the bad news is that it could be
accompanied with better ventilation the
glass panel can stay too vented
chamfered edges would also improve it to
some degree the vertical GPU test was
slightly worse at fifty-six point four
degrees over ambient but that's a
promising sign since we sometimes see
CPU temperature improve when a
vertically mounted GPU is really
suffocated more on this momentarily
comparatively an average CPU temperature
of 54 point six degrees over ambient
puts the Helios alongside the view 71
and the stock much of IC it's not a bad
place to be in general but remember that
the match
if I see is way cheaper and it doesn't
really come with any fans like not any
meaningful amount if you add fans it
gets a lot better so it's ridiculous
really for a case with this many fans to
be positioned here and even more
ridiculous for the price the 42-degree
delta t / ambient results with no front
panel or filter is lower than anything
else on the chart including the raven
0-2 and this case configuration with a
well-made mesh panel would still be very
competitive in the 50 degrees Celsius
range thanks to all the fans available
Asus could have done a lot better here
and they don't have to go full mesh
either but there are other solutions to
improve airflow like a more clever
implementation of the glass rather than
just slapping a flat sheet of it in
front of the fans the FIR mark portion
of the GPU tasks raised GPU temperature
on average to 49 degrees Celsius over
ambient when stock looking at just the
Helios right now for GPU thermals and
this showed a less dramatic improvement
at 42 point 2 degrees Celsius over
ambient with no front panel installed
the vertical GPU results at fifty one
point two degrees delta T over ambient
wasn't much worse than stock since we
mounted the GPU as close to the
motherboard as physically possible using
the slot close to the glass would have
abysmal results as it always does so we
would strongly recommend if going
vertical for an air cooled card use it
near the motherboard if you use vertical
mounting for an open-loop card it really
doesn't matter put it wherever you want
comparatively the stock GPU temperature
is more competitive than the CPU wise
since cases tend to fall down on GPU
cool it the wall of air pushed by the
three intake fans puts the GPU result
between the PMO one and the Rosewill :
in both cases that we've recommended on
multiple occasions vertical GPU mounting
with an air-cooled card isn't out of the
question either which is rarely true
just make sure it's close to the board
the GPU temperature average during 3d
mark firestrike extreme test was less
than one degree higher than the torture
test averaging forty nine point two
eight degrees there's often an increase
of a couple of degrees between the two
tests so the Helios is even more
competitive here placed between the
cooler master age five
mash and the rv0 - again the sheer
number of fans contributes more than
anything to the performance but we do
have to give credit where it's due
Asus is doing much better with the GPU
thermals than the CPU thermals kind of a
backhanded compliment but it is actually
doing decently I miss 3dmark fire strike
test so that's that's good but under CP
testing average the CPU thousands of
temperature over ambience of 39.2
degrees on the same level as the
disappointing PMO - in our comparative
chart there's a good front to back
airflow pattern with the stock fans but
there just isn't enough cool air coming
in and through the CPU cooler as
demonstrated with the huge temperature
drop when the front panel was removed in
that earlier test we've had cases do
much worse but the Helios should be
better than that
GPU temperature in the blender render
average twenty four point eight degrees
Celsius over ambiens which again
compares much more favorably to the
other results it's tied with the RV zero
two and almost with the RL zero six two
of the overall best cooled cases we've
tested the Helios holds its own in the
category of GPU thermals by throwing
fans at it which is by extension
throwing money at it
moving on to noise the Helios running at
max case fan speed as it was in the
baseline torture test measured 45 DBA or
louder than any other stock
configuration for the most part that
we've tested other than the PM I want
there are a lot of big fans moving air
very fast and of course we have the
system noise as well and so although the
glass panel restricts air it isn't
sealed in the restrict nodes as a
reminder alternatively going with a more
open panel design or just better airflow
in general like a side intake for
example as a means to still allow a flat
front panel you would be able to drive
down the noise levels by reducing the
fan speed just because more air gets
through and they don't have to fight as
hard for the air that they get to be
really straightforward with this case
then the rog helios is a case for
customers who are strongly invested in
the asus rog product law and that's fine
that is a market asus is big enough to
create one like that so it's really
meant to go with other rog stuff it's
meant for people who buy basically every
Asus component out
there and go with or a sink for
everything or something along those
lines and it's it's it's hard to say how
well a case like this will sell because
the pricing is high and then the market
is ROG fans there are a lot of those out
there
and a lot of them spend a lot of money
on high-end motherboards we use them for
our overclocking benchmarks and videos
so we know the price of them so it's
good in stock they're all performance in
GPU thermals it actually is genuinely
pretty competitive in GPU thermal is now
competitive means two different things
there's value competitive which it isn't
this isn't a value case you don't buy it
for value just like you don't buy the C
700m repiy for value and then there's
there's just straight-out objectively
competitive ignoring the price and it is
for GPU thermals for a CPU thermals it's
kind of rough this case could do a lot
better it's a matter of just obstructed
ventilation as it often is the space in
between the glass panel and the front
panel of the case to our recollection is
better than we saw a Computex although
we didn't measure it with a ruler at
Computex so that's good if true and
either way it's it's certainly better
than we've seen for other cases with a
glass front panel but there are things
that could be improved here like finding
some way to maybe I don't know you could
chamfer the edges a bit allow some extra
air to go in there for example without
killing the glass as soon as someone
figures out how to cut holes in glass
that'll be great for her for case
manufacturing but it's just it's too
expensive it's not really happening
anytime soon for ventilation purposes
better off with mesh so side intakes
another great way of doing this a bottom
intake another great way of doing this
and still having your glass front that
you want to have so there are things
that could be done but it's really not
the worst and that is a compliment
because motherboard manufacturers have a
history of making literally the worst
cases on the market so asus in the very
least good job at breaking that trend it
is not the worst on the market so
seriously that's that is the motherboard
manufacturers have done cases poorly for
long enough now
that every time we hear about one it's
just like oh god no what do they do and
stop it
so this is an improvement over that it's
still 280 dollars there are still better
options thermally there's still more
refined options in terms of just build
quality and features issues kind of went
the route you might expect a budding
case manufacturer to go and just sort of
threw everything at it got really
excited about all the accessory options
and bundled them all in there even
though several of them really just are
pointless or don't serve enough of a
benefit to justify the cost of the
addition so as patrick said this does
tick as many boxes as possible
it takes the GPU support box for
vertical it takes the fan control box
LED control cable cover carry handle etc
it's beyond what most people would
really spend on a case and even
generously assuming someone would spend
$20 on each of these fans you're still
left with like a $200 enclosure alone
just the box so the view 71 TG is
distinctively RGB heavy and or can be
the RGB version and tempered glass
adorned so that's a competitive option
if you would like to look around the
cooler master H 500 m is another
expensive high-end RGB focused option if
you would like to look at that one and
there are plenty others we've reviewed
the C 700 series perhaps as well now any
of these you would need help carry into
a LAN party it's not the most expensive
thing or the most the heaviest thing in
the world when it's built it is rather
unwieldy though and like that's not an
easy thing what sits on a table to lift
up so that's so bad once I have to
figure out how to transfer to them okay
so there's how the straps work the
points I suppose the maybe rhetorical
one is that this is either good for
deadlifting or land parties if you
really wanted to pee
Oh who wants to go through this to show
your friends how much you lift so anyway
it's really not terrible and we'll
probably leave that there so thank you
for watching
just like here is Nexus dotnet if you'd
like to pick up something like one of
our mod mats or you can go to
patreon.com/scishow and access to grab a
