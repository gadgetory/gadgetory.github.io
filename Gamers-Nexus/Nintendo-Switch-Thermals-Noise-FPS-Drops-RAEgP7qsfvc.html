down and the joy con which was really
the nightmare to put back together and
the doc are all functional so with that
we were able to go forth and do some
thermal benchmarking and noise level
benchmarking on the switch which uses
about 25 millimetres fan
24:25 so we've got some thermal and
noise analysis on this it's a bit of a
fun side project no frame rate stuff as
of yet maybe in the future at some point
but before getting to the switch this
content is brought to you by EVGA and
they're 1080 TI FTW three icx cards
that's coming out soon and EVGA is 1080
TI FTW three is this thermistors placed
all over the board to provide a reading
on BRM and vram performance useful for
lowering overall noise output of the GP
fan learn more in the link of the
description below the nintendo shield
uses a modified at maxwell SOC from
nvidia it has some modifications in
theory from nintendo we don't know
exactly what those are but is a maxwell
SOC because its maxwell SOC and because
we're running on a super lockdown OS
thank you nintendo we have no real way
of monitoring anything that's going on
in the system that means for any
measurement of temperature of frequency
framerate anything like that we need
external tools software hardware
otherwise so for the thermal
measurements on this reusing
thermocouples i've explained these
several times before in videos on the
channel but you can check the link in
the description below for the article
version of this video where we explain
test methodology in addition to those
thermocouples for the temperature
readings we're using a noise meter just
a DB meter to measure the noise output
of the fan as it ramps into a heavier
workload so we're able to plot
temperature versus time and versus noise
which is interesting because we can see
how the fan handles is heavier workloads
considering we have no other way to read
the fan pack we've no reads way to read
the GPU clock rate or anything like that
for today is testing we decided to look
at thermal performance versus fan speed
and match that against heuristics for
framerate and by that basically mean
observation because again there are no
framing and monitoring tools that are
public without making our own for
thermals that we're using those
thermocouples attached to the top center
of the SOC die and
top center of the memory module closest
to the USB port in the switch the USB
type-c port those thermocouples only
give us the case temperature of the die
or the memory module casing so we don't
have a proper junction temperature as of
now which is really the interesting one
but we can look at the case temperature
and still figure out if there's a
throttle point based on the numbers of
outputs and the sort of observation of
frame rates within the game in this case
that would be Legend of Zelda we do know
that the Tegra x1 this is the x1 not
lean in Tendo modified one will operate
at higher clock speeds went under a
juncture temperature of 70 C and it
drops about 6% went under or between 70
and 90 C and then reaches t.j.maxx some
around 105 C depending on which specific
implementation you have we're not sure
how comparable the switch at so C is in
regard to these temperatures but it's
probably not all that different still
we're working with what is effectively a
T case measurement not a t-junction
measurement so do keep that in mind now
again for full testing methodology check
the link in the description below that
will talk about how the thermocouples
are set up and the position of the noise
meter and things like that the frequency
spectrum analysis is not something we do
a whole lot of so it's not as
scientifically defined as the other
processes in this TAS seemed like the
thermal measurements but hopefully it
will give a baseline as to what type of
frequency is emitted from the fan it is
kind of shrill so that's the best we've
got for you if you have suggestions on
improving frequency spectrum analysis in
the future post them below because this
is something that I've been looking into
getting more involved with in the future
for PC components let's start with just
the temperatures then look at noise and
then plot them against one another this
chart shows the switch from initial boot
through gameplay in breath of the wild
and the big dip around the 1,200 second
mark is when we were forced into the
inventory menu by a prompt which
immediately drives temperature down
about nine Salty's in some cases the
menu and tutorial interrupts help the
switch recover its temperature to some
extent and this can be seen on observing
fan noise versus on-screen action as
well for the temperature chart red
represents the memory temperature and
that is again the module located closest
to the type C port and orange represents
the SOC temperature
there is one other memory package on the
switch but we're only measuring that one
close to the USB type-c slot at boot
temperatures are expected ly close to
our ambient temperature of roughly 28
Celsius throughout this test as we
launch and load the game temperatures
rise until they hit about 57 Celsius on
both measured devices and then drop with
each menu or prompt or interrupt it's
not until around the 1600 second mark in
this chart that the switch starts
dithering around where we assume its
maximum temperature spec is which is
triggered most consistently by engaging
in combat with multiple enemies
concurrently the SOC drives up to around
59 Celsius and each time we hit that 59
to 60 C effective case temperature we
were observing a frame rate reduction or
stutter in gameplay and combat it seems
that the switch is oscillating it's
clock between maximum boost and some
lower value when attempting to impose
thermal constraints so we don't know
precisely what temperature in terms of
Junction this constraint would start
existing because again we don't have a
Junction measurement and we have no
access to official white papers given
that this is just a package reading 59 C
is actually pretty high junction
temperature would be a good bit higher
than this if not significantly higher
and let's look now at DBA output stand
alone over a shorter period of time for
a baseline of the fan noise here we're
seeing the decibel output increase as
load ramps with dips corresponding again
with loading screens or menu pop-ups and
just for the records the device was
muted for this towards seconds of 400 to
500 were near multiple other actors in
game who are driving up the fan rpm DBA
output peaks at around 33 to 35 DBA when
under heavier loads including those
combat workloads and this is about the
noise output of our case test bench PC
one in the frackle define see that we're
currently testing an tune reviewing so
in terms of comparing it to your PC it's
really not that loud in terms of raw DBA
output this is completely bearable
especially assuming you're setting up
the console at a TV where you're
probably 5 to 10 feet away and you've
likely got game audio plane these things
that will completely obfuscate the noise
and the handheld mode though it always
becomes a bit more noticeable but that's
mostly because
that's spitting it into your face out of
the back of the unit this is also true
for temperature though depending on
where your head is you might not
actually feel that the type of noise
produced by the switch is of a high
frequency nature generally producing an
annoying Y and that's particularly heavy
in the 1,400 Hertz some times 400 600
Hertz range depending on just how fast
the fans going this isn't a perfect test
environment as stated we're not using an
anechoic chamber or anything like that
but we're still able to log the tone
output by the switch fan with relative
accuracy here's a sample of what sets
and sounds like let's look at these
temperatures versus the noise plotted
against one another this chart shows how
the temperature and noise ramped up
alongside the other fan noise and
therefore fan rpm climbs steadily as SOC
and memory temperature increase this
chart is cropped in to an earlier part
of the test so we're only maxing out at
around 57 C instead of the 59 C max
temperature reading that we had and were
able to see that the DBA output remains
pretty much in a bearable range of 33 to
35 DBA and again considering you'll have
volume and probably distance that's
really nothing to get mad about what is
annoying is the higher pitch frequency
if you're close enough to hear it or if
you're particularly sensitive to those
frequencies what this mostly shows is
that there seems to be some sort of
clock management going on based on
thermals and that's again without a hard
measurement for framerate but we can
observe a gameplay and see very clear
stutters or frames dips as many other
people will tell you in plane press of
the wild on the switch particularly we
can observe those that frame anomalies
or poor performance periods and plot
that versus the temperature and
generally with our thermocouple hitting
59 C which really who knows what the
junction temperature is at that
effective case temperature but with our
thermocouple hitting and maintaining at
that temperature output it would seem
that's about when the clock starts to
either throttle or there's something
going on within the frequency and
boosting functionality to prohibit a
runaway thermal scenario or start
triggering other thermal trip points
in the case of the switch seeing those
lower dips in frame rates correspond
with the 59 C temperature would lead us
to believe that in theory there's some
sort of clock reduction that's not
necessarily the only reason you would
have those poor performance periods but
it could just be poor optimization it
could be too many Polly's and too much
geometry on the scene at once but
generally it is during those heavy
combat periods one ways to validate this
theory would be to improve cooling so
that's an option but for now in the
immediate future we have a few new KH
reviews coming out this week there will
be a 1700 X review on the website only
no video for that so you have to go to
the website today for that review will
be posted around the same time as this
video give or take a few hours overall
though the switch for noise output not
so bad DBA is ok temperatures a bit warm
definitely approaching either some kind
of throttle temperature or if not that
just the game is way too much for that
so see to handle in those heavy load
combat scenarios particularly with the
more geometrically complex mobs but
overall that's what we've got for you
for the switch for thermal and noise
analysis I wish we could do more but
based on the limited tools available
that is to say strictly hardware
solutions no software solutions that's
the best that we can do today thank you
