tonight and today we're reviewing the
initech 4005 USB 3.0 PCIe expansion card
that is a mouthful you may have heard me
say the word initech which for those of
you who know office space will be
wondering if their building has burned
down I assure you this is a different in
attack in fact it uses an A instead of
an ISO perhaps it was not burned down by
Milton was that his name I think his
name was Milton anyway
sweet hide staplers aside the initech
PCIe device that was sent to me is a
four port USB 3.0 device it's just an
expansion card it plugs into your
motherboard on a PCIe x1 and can be
accessed through the expansion slots in
the back it adds four USB 3.0 ports to
your setup so if you're using an AM 3
board and three plus board whatever and
you don't have USB 3.0 onboard for your
front panel header on the case then this
is the sort of thing you would want to
have or if you just need more ports now
the concern with any device that is
similar to this is that you will lose
performance because the controller it is
assumed if it is using a non card
controller and not the board might be
actually subpar compared to what you get
on the board it depends how it's it's
communicating with the USB 3 controller
and what it has on its own device so I
tested this with three different
configurations technically four but
we're only talking about three here and
two of those are single stick tests
meaning one stick I used a Corsair
Voyager 32 gigabyte USB 3 from O stick
and test that with crystal disk and HD
tune plus and then I also used a single
stick of Kingston's data traveler
ultimate which is of course actually not
the best one they have one more that's
predator but it's basically the best
because it's called ultimate that is a
32 gigabyte very fast USB 3.0 expansion
device and then I did a third test which
is dual stick testing meaning two sticks
in the device at the same time both
saturated Foley so it should saturate
the bus a bit more and test if the
controller still performs well under
full load from multiple devices doing
multiple transfers so that's what we
tested I did a fourth test that is not
shown here because the results are
similar of four devices connected at the
same time all USB 3.0 all saturating the
bus let's start with the single stick
test on Corsairs voyager 32
by USB 3.0 card oh ho that is a lot of
words so in this test I ran crystal disk
mark for this particular one and we can
see the random right for kqd 32 and then
read and I also did tune-up one test
which if you're a gamer random write and
read and 4kq depth one is what you're
gonna see more but we're talking about
transfers for USB devices here not for
SSDs so it's a bit different random
writes 512 K which are pretty really not
too common and then we have sequential
write and sequential read which are
going to be for your larger files like
transferring movies stuff like that if
you transfer big files through your USB
devices and this is the one you care
about most
in these tests I'm not even going to
read through them all because as you can
see they are all basically the same
every difference is within margin of
error here there is no groundbreaking
report that I have for you in fact in a
single device scenario in a text
expansion card performs basically
flawlessly I technically had to send me
a second card their first one was
malfunctioning when I used sticks in any
type of synthetic or real-world tests
because they would disconnect but they
sent me a second card same exact model
and this one works perfectly so looking
at the Kingston device which performs
better than Corsairs voyager so should
theoretically push limits more it's the
same story all the differences are
within margin of error and really the
initech and onboard devices kind of go
back and forth which with each other
which tells you that the difference is
really more in how the test software is
handling its testing and how the device
is receiving the testing as opposed to
the actual controller on each device so
once again within margin of error and it
performs basically perfectly so good on
in attack therefore that looking at the
dual stick test we finally get some more
interesting numbers and this one the
random reads and writes are pretty
uninteresting but looking down to the
higher speed transfer options like
random read 512k you see that there's
actually a big difference there's almost
a 40 megabytes per second difference in
transfer rate between the initech device
and the on-board USB 3.0 ports and what
this means is that however in attack is
communicating with
USB 3.0 controller it is not handling
saturation as well as the onboard
controller which is probably much higher
end because it's a high onboard so that
is the story of that and you can see
that this follows through with
sequential reads so it's really just
reads here this the writes are
performing just fine it's reads that are
an issue and reads we lose almost 80
megabytes per second and speed now is
this a huge deal well it really depends
if you're just transferring movie files
music files things like that and you
need those extra ports you might as well
just buy this because it's 80 megabytes
per second out of 200 yes it hurts but
if that's the only option you gotta take
what you can get right you can spend a
little bit more and get something higher
end so it ultimately depends on your
budget and in terms of budget the card I
tested the expansion card is actually
only 16 dollars so if you're on a budget
this is performing extremely well
considering it's cheap it's from a
relatively unknown brand it's probably
supplied from somewhere in Asia and then
just rebrand it as an attack but hey if
it works it's cheap who cares it seems
to be doing the job now if you're going
to be doing a lot of high saturation
data transfer with all ports saturated
you're gonna have some speed and
performance degradation but that's just
the risk you take so in that scenario
what you need to do is look for a better
better motherboard or look for a
higher-end controller and card in one
unit which will cost you a bit more
money probably closer to the 30 to 50
dollar range because you're gonna need
more throughput so that's just the
nature of it if you're the kind of
person who's just looking for 1 to 4
slots and you're really not pushing true
USB 3.0 constant throughput on all these
devices the initech 4000 5 PCIe card is
really just fine for your needs and at
16 dollars the price is pretty damn good
so I would recommend this if you are one
of those people if you need more speed
don't buy it buy something better
because you're just gonna regret the
purchase that is all I have to say about
