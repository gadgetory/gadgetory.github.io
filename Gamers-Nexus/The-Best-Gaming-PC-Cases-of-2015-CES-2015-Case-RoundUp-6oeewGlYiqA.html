dotnet and we are looking at the best
cases of 2015 this is a roundup of all
the gaming cases and enclosures I saw at
CES 2015 these are brand new products
that we'll be shipping soon or have just
begun shipping recently and there's not
quite as much in the mid-range market
this year as there was in the previous
year there's been a shift in the market
but we saw a lot of really cool budget
cases and some pretty fancy high-end
$800 cases that you probably won't be
buying but they're pretty cool to look
at very quickly all this content brought
to you by cyber powers cyber vapor
gaming PC the first case we're looking
at is silver stones Raven rvz 0-2 which
is a brilliant innovation in Mini ITX
cases we were huge fans of this one The
Raven zo2 is a new version of the Raven
0 one very obvious there with a naming
but it's actually smaller than
previously it has zero case fans and
instead it uses slotted design in the
acrylic windows they are acrylic windows
on the top and bottom on opposite sides
so your side panels are actually
mirrored you can install either side
panel on either side and the reason that
works is because this case is using a
PCIe riser card so you're your plug in a
riser card to the PCI Express slot on
the motherboard and the motherboard
faces the right side and then the video
card actually faces the left side so
this exposes the video cards faceplate
to the outside of the case which given
the focus on high quality and sort of
artistic faceplates lately with video
cards this is a very cool thing in my
opinion so you've got on one side
exposed video card the other side
exposed CPU cooler and then you need a
high end CPU cooler that's lower than 60
millimeters in height in order to
adequately cool the thing because it has
no case fans but it is meant for mini
ITX and a home theater year so if you're
putting some 87 want intel cpu and there
you'll be just fine with something like
the AR 0 6 CPU cooler so that is the
Raven 0 2 pretty darn cool and it uses a
completely coolest design for the
optional slim optical drive
Silverstone's raven zo Tilley priced at
less than $85 there
100% sure the final price but it will be
less than $85 moving on to the next case
in the budget range is coarser is 100 r
and 100 our silent Edition these two
cases are very similar to the next
Silverstone cases we're talking about
because they both have the same idea at
the same time the 100 R is a $50 case
and the 100 are silent is a $60 case the
only difference between the two being
that the 100 our silent Edition uses
very thick foam padding in the deep side
panels so that's sort of a big deal with
this case is the side panel bezel is
very deep allowing more cable management
and allowing the foam if you get the
silent position to be somewhat thick
very few factories are able to stamp a
bezel this deep without cracking the
side panel so only a couple case
manufacturers actually make cases this
way the 100 are priced at $50 is capable
of mounting to 140 millimeter front fans
and to 120 millimeter top fans allowing
room for some growth but includes a
single 120 millimeter rear exhaust fan
so you'll probably want to throw a fan
on there almost immediately if you buy
this case I would suggest a 140 front
fan to get some use out of that surface
area but it's it's a very good starting
point for budget gaming systems and is
sort of in the spirit of the 200 R which
is one of our most recommended budget
cases from a few years ago silver stones
at PS 11 be probably not the most
user-friendly name in the world is
actually almost an identical case to the
100 R and at CES Silverstone noted that
they had this idea a while ago and they
felt that it was very validating that a
company as large as Corsair had a
similar idea with their 100 R so the PS
11 B is effectively direct almost
identical competition to the 100-hour
it's priced strictly at $50 even the
silent edition of the PS 11 B and it
uses the same type of side panel
stamping it's a very deep bezel allowing
for a lot of cable management allowing
for thicker foam the lion major
difference is that the foam and the PS
11 B isn't the same type of foam as in
the 100 are silent edition so that may
be worth at your $10 price difference
kicks in moving on to the mid ray
cases the best mid-range cases really
are actually ones that came out at the
very end of 2014 they snuck into 2014
but looking at two of the cases that
were from last year first the BitFenix
pandora has come out now with a 2.4 inch
LCD on front of it the LCD is actually
customisable by the user you can put
your own logo in it you can put your
face in it really you can put whatever
you want as long as it fits in that 2.4
inch LCD and allow some customization of
the case this is one of the most
affordable aluminum using cases in this
market it's not all aluminium I say it
that way for a reason but it is the most
affordable at $120 with the window or
110 without the window so that is the
pandora by a bit phoenix worth looking
into doesn't support full ATX though the
fractal define r5 is able to mount ATX
micro ATX and mini ITX so it supports
all of the form factors that are really
relevant to gamers it has fully modular
hard drive and optical drive cages so
you can actually remove all of the
optical and hard drive cages if you
wanted to and then mount your SSDs to
the rear side of the motherboard which
supports two SSDs in a concealed fashion
Thermaltake score x9 it came out
alongside the core x2 and x1 at CES the
x2 and x1 being smaller and cheaper the
core x9 is priced at about $170 so
really it's sort of in the enthusiast
side of things the core x9 uses
horizontally mounted motherboards and
then the rest of the trays and rails can
be moved around or removed as you see
fit so if you'd like to use one of these
enclosures strictly for a liquid cooling
setup and then pipe all the liquid down
to a system below it where the
motherboard rest you can do that because
these systems will allow pass-through if
you stack them vertically using the
magical powers of gravity you can run
tubing from one to the other so that is
the cortex line the x2 is a bit more
affordable it's closer to 120 dollars
and then the x1 is $100 and those two
are just smaller enclosures with more
limited motherboard form factor support
but they are definitely way easier to
fit in your house all three of these
cases are very wide
so a lot of you probably won't have room
to fit this sort of thing than a normal
computing space that you're used to so
do keep that in mind it does require
more square footage now for the best
enthusiast cases these are the most
interesting ones by far in one's ass box
at $300 is a somewhat affordable
arguably piece of case art in one's s
box uses an aluminum sheet a single
sheet that's been bent a few times by
hand by two employees using a press and
then it has a big sheet of tempered
glass covering the enclosure so that's
some high-quality glass that anyone is
not afraid to use they used it with
their D frame last year and the S box
uses a single piece of aluminum so it
gives sort of a more pristine design
appearance it's somewhat practical to
build in but you're definitely buying
this more for the artwork side of things
then for practicality at this point
especially at three hundred dollars deep
cool and CyberPower work together on
this next one it is the Trinity and it's
effectively eccentricity in case form
it's a 350 dollar 50 pound triforce like
Star Wars lambda shuttle things so if
you want a case that is very different
this is probably something to consider
it has three compartmentalised shells
that are made of steel and they're in
the sort of effectively the bottom left
bottom right and then top Center so it
looks sort of like a triangle in effect
and to that end the case installs the
motherboard and power supply and video
card all three in separate compartments
so they are not in the same compartment
together in a clever fashion deep :
cyber power have routed all the cables
through the center of the case and
because of this pre routing the wires
are much easier to manage you just
connect the power supply to the
extension and then you connect the
extension to the component in the
receiving compartment in one zest frame
is $800 it is a showroom case it uses a
single piece of aluminum folded 15 times
by hand and with the press so it's a
very expensive and time-consuming
manufacturing process hence the price
being passed on to the user but because
of this it's a very unique looking and
it's got a more hand
crafted appearance to it the case does
not include any fans that will support
them and the company recommends using
all liquid cooling instead as it looks a
bit better in a case like this again it
like the S box it uses a big tempered
sheet of glass on the left side panel so
that is the S frame very worth looking
into just for the fact that it's cool I
wouldn't really recommend buying it from
really even the people who can afford it
but it's very cool and all of these
cases are worth looking into for 2015 we
will have more case roundups as the year
progresses and more cases are launched
we expect something from NZXT and expect
more from Corsair in the future so that
is the best cases of 2015 check the link

all next time peace
