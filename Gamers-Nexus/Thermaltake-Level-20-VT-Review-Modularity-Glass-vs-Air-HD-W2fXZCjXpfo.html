months ago at Computex alongside the
level 20 GT and XT the VT is a micro ATX
case and the smallest of the three
inside and out the VT is similar to
thermal takes mini ITX v1 that we
reviewed and even more so similar to the
micro ATX v 21 the major difference is
the use of tempered glass which could be
a sign of Silverstone syndrome or
following up a well ventilated case with
a sealed box however as we pointed out
at Computex the level 20 cases are being
sold alongside the older mesh front 2 V
1 and V 21 rather than replacing them in
addition Thermaltake has earned the
benefit of the doubt with cases like the
view 71 and 37 which appear sealed but
actually still managed to keep
temperatures reasonable today we're
reviewing the thermal take level 20 V T
before that this video is brought to you
by Lian Li is 11 dynamic a case largely
designed by overclocker Deir Bauer for
high performance water cooling though
our performance testing also Illustrated
strong air cooling performance the 11
dynamic is affordable high build quality
and offers a unique form factor case
with dual PSU support by one now at the
link in the description below their own
takes level 20 series is supposed to be
a hailer products we originally talked
about it maybe two years ago at Computex
or CES and the tooling alone for the
case was a half a million dollars plus
and they're probably approaching closer
to 750,000 or higher at this point with
the level 20 revision so really
expensive to make the case and the
original was meant to be a follow-up to
that BMW design chassis from ages ago
and just the level 10 that is and
supposed to look like something special
for thermal takes 20th anniversary hence
at level 20 I think though it released
on the 19th to anniversary but close
enough they were excited about yes he
stood a bit early so level 20 VT is the
smallest of the level 20 series this is
a $100 chassis it's micro ATX quick
sidenote
we're testing with mini ITX because we
don't presently have micro ATX bench
we're just we're getting there but we're
doing mini ITX for now just cuz it fits
and we can still do our tasking with it
so
go over that more later though but the
case itself it's tempered glass mostly
everywhere still follows the highly
modular design of the v1 the v21 there's
an older thermal take small boxes that
were very popular for mini ITX micro ATX
systems for SF fht pcs stuff like that
so this is following suit except it's a
tempered glass and as noted in the intro
it's not like they're cancelling the
sales of the original so if you do
prefer the mesh cheaper steel paneled
versions you can still get that it's
just that this one goes a bit harder
with the glass and thus is a bit more
expensive by the way quick side note
these are back in stock but so this case
the most obvious thing that probably all
of you are going to comment on is the
minimal amount of airflow and spacing
for air flow it's interesting though
with thermal takes cases in the past the
v71 view 37 they kind of followed the
same pattern where they had a lot of
tempered glass but there was more sort
air spacing in between the glass panels
on those and they actually breathe
pretty well surprisingly well actually
so we can kind of give this the benefit
of the doubt until we get into the
thermal section later but for the the
most part here you have very limited
gapped space in here there's no
ventilation at the top that's okay we'd
like to see this gap raised a bit so
that there's more air if you decide to
put some fans on the top for a radiator
or something pushing out or well really
either direction but if you're pushing
air out it's just hitting the glass
gonna warm up the glass which is fine
but dispersing it out of the case is
wasting a lot of your pressure so that
is a bit of a concern but we'll test in
the thermal section to see if it matters
or not because as noted some of thermal
takes other cases that were similarly
concerning actually performed very well
but the cool thing of this one is that
the panels are more or less completely
modular we actually have a shot of the
front panel rotated sideways as well so
you can pretty much change them and put
the panels wherever you want it's the
same thermal takes down for a while they
definitely get credit for it because
it's cool not a lot of people
manufacturers that is allow modularity
of cases to that degree and so if it's
something you want more customizable
it's a point of note that not many cases
give you especially in this form factor
so this panel pulls off the other panels
same thing they all slide off you can
swap them around if you want it means a
bit less with this case then with the
v1v 21 because you can swap mesh and
acrylic panels on those and change where
your air flow intakes are out or
exhausts are the front of the case is
where there's a 200 millimeter fan that
is entirely blocked by glass but there's
some side intake and we run into an aged
500 Peterson area here where if you gave
it enough breathing room it might be
okay but this isn't a ton of breathing
room it's less than an inch for air to
actually get in there so you're losing
30% of your pressure every time you're
making a 90-degree turn with that fan
which is already kind of low pressure
well look at the thermals in a moment
but just wanted to point it out because
it's something that everyone's gonna
comment on straight away and there's
good reason to what we would like to see
is the top elevated a little bit and the
front either pushed out or truncated so
that there's a bit more exposure to air
it does not have to be matched we're not
asking for every single case to be high
airflow mesh it's just you know enough
that it can get air in while still
maintaining some of the look and it's
possible to do that even just something
like ventilating this it could probably
still look pretty good if you ventilated
the sides here and got some extra
airflow through that vector so anyway
that's the basics on airflow comes with
1/200 you've got an option for a 140 in
the back and options for mounting there
rails on the top that are actually very
easy to remove and move around they're
pretty sweet so if you wanted to change
it your radiator setup or really
anything that fan top fan setup in the
case it's pretty easily done and it just
has rails that they all slot into just
like that so modularity wise thermal
takes done a great job on the case
making sure it's easy to work with easy
to move stuff around easy to access it's
extremely easy to build in for micro ATX
case that's a bit larger that's not all
that impressive but ease of installation
is an important thing when you're doing
with smaller boxes even though it's not
small properly so they've done well on
the front of build quality and ease of
installation whether or not you like the
looks is subjective that's up to you
we'll leave it up to you so
what we're gonna do now is go through
the rest of Patrick's build notes as
always talk about his experience with
the case and then we'll go through the
thermal testing section and see if it
does well enough considering the
alternatives in the Mini ITX testing
that we've done so far the panes of
glass are mounted to metal frames that
attach the chassis so there are no holes
or screws through the glass there's also
nothing to prevent the side panels from
flopping off once they've been unscrewed
but that's much more forgivable with
these small and relatively light glass
panels made in a small form-factor case
the top pane in particular is lifted
away from the body of the chassis to
allow some airflow similar to the view
71 just less of it and the side and
bottom panels are swappable like they
were in the view want the case can be
placed on any of its sides by moving the
bottom panel quote unquote bottom that
is an aside and top panels can be
swapped around as well
this feature is important because only
one glass panel the stock top panel has
an air gap for fans and radiators but
this panel can be moved to any side of
the case if you wanted to move things
around the i/o is attached with a single
screw and also very easily installed on
the top left or right of the case which
means that the front panel can be
rotated as well so the sticker will
rotate with that front io is adequate
but only includes two USB 2.0 ports and
for those who want it there's no USB
type-c there are four metal rails that
clip into the sides or top of the case a
pair of them can be used to attach a
radiator or some fans which then clip
onto the chassis the concept of a semi
to list radiator mount the rail still
has to be screwed into the radiator is a
great concept but the rails themselves
are a little thin and rattling hopefully
Thermaltake continues to develop this
feature because it's one that we think
works well thermaltake clearly intends
the VT the sport liquid cooling and it
even has an old-school grommet on the
back of the case or externally mounted
open loops stock cooling is a single two
hundred millimeter fan in the front of
the case behind a glass panel and we
talked about that already
we mentioned in our - ATX micro ATX
review that since the case was barely
small form-factor it wasn't 100% fair to
compare it to the extremely compact Mini
ITX cases on our chart like the two ATX
the VTS volume isn't overwhelmingly
smaller than a normal town so this gets
into the same thing we've talked about
with all these smaller case reviews now
we're working with a small case there's
a lot of parameters people define them
differently our test bench is up for
really small cases like the Raven series
where you need a downdraft cooler to
make sure there's clearance this case
clearly can fit an open-loop if you
wanted to do it really if it all kinds
of radiators you can fit a taller tower
cooler so our test bench is not the best
representation of what you could do in
the case but it allows us to do some
standardized testing in the future we're
looking at adding maybe a micro ATX test
bench or in the very least adding
another mini ITX bench that's got a
taller like 150 tower cooler or
something on it since so many cases
accommodate that whether or not you
consider it small form factors it's not
like there's a hard definition for it
but this would exit our definition of a
small form factor it's pretty large in
terms of volume it's a big case and that
means that the parts we use for testing
aren't perfect but they're fine for just
a standardized comparison while we work
towards filling out our mini ITX micro
ATX testing some more so for the rest
then drive space is extremely generous
given the form factor really not a
surprise for the space there is space
for three 3.5 inch drives that makes it
a possible candidate for storing lots of
media there are 2.5 inch drive sleds
beside that and these are attached to a
track along the side of the case that
can be moved around on it for optimal
cable routing for thermals and noise the
bt again one big 200 millimeter fan in
the front and can't really move it
elsewhere there's no space for it so we
didn't have a bunch of alternative
configurations to test like we do on
some other cases we wanted to try
swapping the side panels around so we
move them around on the case we rotated
some stuff a bit played with the
modularity for thermal testing so we
have some of those numbers for you it's
referred as rotating when we show them
in the charts that's the word you'll be
looking for because the chassis was
rotated 90 degrees inside the side
panels everything else inside the
chassis was rotated along with it of
course and the front panel was rotated
as well since relocating the i/o is sort
of a hassle once you have all the
components already installed for CPU
torture focusing first on just the VT
torture test in brought average CPU DT
to sixty six point eight degrees Celsius
over ambien
on the first pass and about 67 on the
second close enough rotating the case
slightly raised temperature to 69
degrees due to some minor airflow
changes although the case fan was in the
same position relative to the CPU the
top panel which has the widest air gap
went from being above the CPU intake fan
to beside it with the rotation this
changes where the air escapes the case
and can cause a draft that pulls some
cooler intake out prior to hitting the
CPU fan relative to the V ones at CPU
temperature average of 69 degrees moving
on to the comparative numbers the stock
VT was slightly cooler this is partly
because the case is larger and there's
more space for air movement around the
CPU cooler but also because the stock v1
has no ventilation on the top panel in
fact the closest CPU average to the VT
was the v1 with the mesh panel place at
the top of the case that's on the warm
end of s FF cases we've tested and is
consistent with other cases that don't
have a case fan aimed directly at the
CPU like to talk to and the SG 13 the
GPU torture test results were extremely
consistent between runs averaging 57
point one degrees Celsius DT the first
time around in 57.2 the second rotating
the case lowered it 256 degrees Celsius
delta T over ambient it makes sense that
rotation would help GPU temperatures
since the GPU intake fan was pointed
towards the ventilated bottom panel
rather than the flat glass panel but a
one point one to one point two degrees
Celsius improvement is only barely
outside of margin of error the VT is GPU
temperature average comparatively is
warmer than the V ones a verge of 50s
five point six degrees Celsius DT but
the v1 and stock configuration has vent
holes directly facing the GPU fan the VT
is the high but not excessive range for
GPU temperatures close to the stock RB
z03 without its fan placement fixed the
case is large and airy enough that our
components weren't roasting in it like
the Taku but the single intake fan
struggles to push enough air on its own
the VT was closer to the v1 and 3d mark
than in the standard torture test the VT
averaged 54 point nine degrees celsius
GPU delta T over ambient and the v1
averaged 54 point one GPU clock speed
averaged roughly the same in both tests
although we've noted barely any very
in GPU clock speed in this test other
than with our in when a one baseline
which was 25 megahertz above the usual
1775 megahertz average again this GPU
average is well below the Taku but
warmer than the SG 13 and 280x
moving on to blender rendering on the
CPU CPU average temperature is 50 point
one degrees which falls in a gap between
the Taku and SG 13 the warmest and now
third warmest averages respectively the
blender test is less stressful than the
torture test but this confirms that even
under normal workloads he can build up
in the VT rendering on the GPU GPU
average DT was 34 point eight degrees
similar to the v1 and the 280x
especially the V want the stock
configuration of the level twenty V's he
runs a bit warmer than so all the other
cases we've tested on the charts and
that's because it's a fairly large case
it includes only one fan and that fan is
pretty restricted so it's okay in
basically every other category except
for cool and you can make the cooling
sort of okay because it does have a lot
of loops for open-loop closed-loop
support you have plenty of liquid
cooling options it's just you're paying
for those and it is a showroom case so
if you're not looking for a showroom
case then probably skip on this one at a
hundred bucks for what you're getting in
terms is just the amount of tempered
glass and the fact that it is meant to
be flashy it's not a bad price it's just
that there's really nothing there to be
excited about in terms of hard
functionality like again airflow the fan
is just one two hundred millimeter fan
nothing special about it doesn't come
with a rear fan at all it's up to you to
do whatever you want to make the cooling
work with your build so you're left on
your own there which sometimes is better
depending on what you want to buy so
this could use an additional fan we
think on the rear position potentially
on the other hand there again is decent
radiator support if you want to fix it
that route beyond gaming the vitia has
good potential in living room
environments if you want something
that's a bit larger because it does have
a lot of drive support so go in for
local drives for all of your movie music
whatever TV show storage this might be a
good solution just because it can fit a
lot of them whereas you might need to go
with a network attached Drive otherwise
for smaller boxes the glass does
actually a pretty good job of noise
damping we
talk about noise in the video version of
this review but it's a bit quieter than
some of the other cases that's because
you have so much thick glass which helps
with the longer wavelength noises
because it's I mean on all sides so
you've got some assistance there since
there's no mesh for any of the noise to
get through but that also means air
doesn't really get through so bit of a
toss up on this one where it's not the
best case we've reviewed for thermals
it's pretty unique looking their own
takes done a great job on modularity
they've done a good job on build quality
it's just they could improve on the
thermals in some significant ways like
just lifting the top a little bit more
it makes the case of larger yes but the
case is already big but by all accounts
this is not really a small form-factor
case so what's another quarter inch or
half inch lift on the glass just to make
sure that if you do put some higher
pressure fans up there you're not
dealing with a ton of noise from the air
getting just kind of squeezed out all
the sides rather than having a direct
path flow or even just a bit more
elevation on it same for the front panel
we'd like to see this either truncated
or boost it away or something or
ventilated cuts put in the side just so
that there's some more help for that 200
to get some air in because the two
hundreds are already natively lower
pressure than a smaller 120 or something
like that so if their own will take has
some things they could definitely
improve upon and there are clear paths
for them to improve upon it so that's
great it'd be nice if we can see that in
the first revision but everything else
is pretty good and solid it's just that
airflow needs some help so they've got a
decent starting product here if you can
work with the cooling or don't care then
everything else seems fine if it's a
problem there are plenty of other good
options out there and we'll have some of
those that linked in the article in the
description below if you're curious
