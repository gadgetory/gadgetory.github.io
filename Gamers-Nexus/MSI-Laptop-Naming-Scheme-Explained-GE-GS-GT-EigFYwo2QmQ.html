in Southern California looking at a ton
of laptops I'm sure we have b-roll of it
but there are two four six there's seven
laptops on the table these are all 10
series for the most products of this one
which I'll talk about in a moment so
before talking about the stealth which
is the one I want to talk about while
leading into the video we have the
confusion of what do all of the letters
and numbers mean so we're going to go
over the naming scheme first because I
think that will help everyone in the
future there is actually a method to the
names and it does make some sense once
you hear it some sense so first of all
there's stealth series these that's the
ones back here these are the thin and
light ones so this would be a GS type
laptop that's stealth gaming stealth and
then they have a number attached them
I'll get to the number in a moment
ready ruined it with fingerprints uh-huh
there's also GT laptops so these kind of
larger ones or midsize in some cases
that's a GT laptop that's the Titan and
then this is another GT but it's one of
the smaller ones that has seen a revival
with Pascal we'll talk about that as
well so tighten both GTS that I picked
up then GE which is the Apache laptops
and that pretty much covers what we have
on the table so walking through what it
means stealth is the thin and light or
small laptops GE is kind of like a
mid-range and then the Titans are bigger
for the numbers the numbers you'll see
are sixes and sevens
so there's sixty threes and
seventy-three s you'll see in older
generations of two sixty to seventy two
so the first number the six in this case
is indicative of the size of the screen
or the entire unit really so six for
this 63 it's going to be a 15.6 inch
display 7s are going to be a seventeen
point three as that's a 73 in this case
and then the eights for the big Titans
like the one from cyber power that's
really an msi rebranded cyber power
laptop that we looked at recently that's
an 18 inch display as for the
the other number the three so the three
is the new generation chassis if you see
a two it means it was a previous
generation chassis and that's really all
that means it's just the chassis
generation it does not necessarily as I
understand it reflect the components
inside so I think that covers the names
I was also given an alternative set of
names of four Titans Death Star's and
then planes and spaceships but that
didn't really help me so we're going to
go with the official names as for the
laptops to show off the stealth is the
one that we haven't really talked about
much we we have the Apache the GE series
laptop in the lab and have already
published some articles on it videos and
stuff like that from the London event
but the stealth is the direct blade
competitor so this would be the
competition to the razor blade if you're
considering that notebook it's a bit
different in some ways the blade does
use soldered memory to its board and
this is so dim so that's a major
difference the body is a bit different
different but in terms of prices things
like that that's kind of where you'd
look for the direct competition the GS
six series this one the 15.6 inch
actually both of these on the table are
running i7 CPUs there are no i5s in any
of these laptops in front of me so their
eye CPUs and then they are both GTX 10
60s for the GPUs this unit here the one
that's been revived
so this Dominator laptop we reviewed a
couple of these in previous generations
but they've been absent recently so it's
been brought back because of high demand
and this one has a gtx 1070 in it and
it's got a case cue cpu so you can
actually overclock the CPU I showed how
to do that in a previous video with the
970m unit actually also in MSI laptop
rebranded a cyber power so if you're
curious about the case qiyu CPUs and how
they work in the hops you can see that
video I think we hit 4.1 gigahertz on it
which is pretty damn good for a CPU and
a laptop and then we overclock the GPU
something like 150 or megahertz offset
or something like that so that's the
basics the stealth the one that I was
focusing on
is the smaller unit it's the one that
I'm most interested in personally just
because of its its form factor and we'll
look at thermals later hopefully but
speaking of thermals it's got three fans
so the previous generation had two fans
on the bottom this one's going up to
three it has two for GPU cooling one for
CPU side cooling and then six heat pipes
in terms of size versus the previous
generation these two units the one
underneath is the previous gen and you
can see it's a bit bigger so that's a
900 series GPU and that the actual
measurement in inches is from memory
0.77 on the 17 inch notebook 0.6 nine
inches on a 15 inch notebook and then
0.78 the 900 series notebook so I think
I think we got it think I got all the
basics it's a lot of stuff but hopefully
it will at least give you the naming
scheme what it means when you're
shopping so you understand looking at
one SKU to the next what the intended
difference is and then we do have some
coverage some basic benchmarks we'll
have more online very shortly so as
always subscribed for those patreon link
the postal video to help us out directly
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
