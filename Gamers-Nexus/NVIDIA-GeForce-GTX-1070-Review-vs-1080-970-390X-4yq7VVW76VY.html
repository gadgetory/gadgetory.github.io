founders edition video card despite
being in taipei taiwan this week for
Computex which is coming up in a few
days we managed to pull off a cold
benchmark and review of the card with
all the usual FPS thermals and
architecture analysis before getting to
that content all of this coverage for
the first few days a Computex
is brought to you by msi and the new x99
a gaming motherboards including the
gaming pro carbon here is a spec stable
first off check the article for full
detail on the gtx 1070 we've compressed
it heavily to fit into a video format
but you'll get additional game tests and
detail in the article the gtx 1070
operates on the GPU 104 GPU from nvidia
starting the pascal architecture the
reference GT x 1080 also operates on a
GP 104 but they're differentiated by
subversion 8 and the 1070 is AGP 104 -
200 that's the important bit the 1080 is
the GP 104 - 400 the silicon is the same
the architecture is mostly the same
where the diet has been somewhat
simplified on the gtx 1070 to reduce
cost the heart of the chip is still the
16 nanometer FinFET design which
operates at a slightly lower voltage
than the planar process previously and
exhibits less power leakage than planar
data path optimizations are also in
place for performance improvements
something we've spent a few thousand
words in our GT X 1080 review covering
if you're curious about that the first
major changes in 1070 is SM count the GP
104 200 GPU has 15 SMS rather than the
20 SMS GP 104 - 400 because of the SM
reduction TM use are naturally also
reduced the 1070 operates on 120 TM use
and those can pipe 202 Giga texels per
second core counts is affirmed 1920 cuda
cores operating at a boosted clock of
1683 megahertz stock the 1070 also uses
gddr5 not
5x and that's at 8 gigabits per second
with a capacity of 8 gigabytes
time to dive into the benchmarks first I
know that's what everyone wants to see
right away as always all the
methodologies to find on the website
links in the description below along
with additional game benchmarks that
aren't shown here if you're curious
about how we test those things here's a
look at the temperatures for the GTX
1080 and gtx 1070 founders Edition cards
we've also got the 1080 hybrid on here
which is a card that
we built custom from the scraps of a
980ti hybrid and a desecrated 1080
reference card or founders edition card
the gtx 1070 operates about equal to the
GTX 980 reference with hitting fifty
three point eight six Celsius the delta
temperature over ambient which is a few
degrees cooler than the gtx 10a TFE at
fifty 7.51 celsius that extra few
degrees will actually help give us some
extra Headroom in overclocking we'll
discuss later on as you'll see in our
three-part hybrid build series where we
explore the temperature limitations The
Fury exits at thirty six point three
nine Sal's heaters a bit warmer than the
other liquid cooled cards but that's
because puri cools its vrm and memory
with liquid as well not just the GPU the
1070 is about six point five five
percent cooler than the GTX 1080
entirely resultant of the die
simplification and here's a look at the
thermals over time charge this data is
pulled from the same test as the peak
load temperature average and shows the
test data over time the Nvidia founders
edition cooler isn't particularly
impressive but it is reasonable in the
very least the FE cooler performs about
where previous reference models have
performed but as always AIB partners
will make significantly more effective
coolers on their cards that be cooler
operates with a maximum fan noise level
of about 47 to 50 decibels which is
reasonable when compared to other
devices just a reminder these are Delta
values this means we subtract ambient so
add your own ambient temperature back in
when you're looking at these numbers of
your house is about seventy F 20 Celsius
you add in 20 Celsius to these numbers
that gives you the operating temperature
of the GPU in your environment and we
removed Delta we do the Delta value for
a few reasons start subtracting ambient
helps control for the natural variance
with the HVAC system between tests and
it also obviously helps you compare on
your own ambient temperatures and so
ours is not the same as yours so here's
a brief endurance chart this shows the
frequency over time versus temperatures
as you can see the 1070 sustains a
pretty stable frequency throughout the
endurance of the test you can read more
about this in the article link in the
description below
time to talk about game benchmarking now
we've got a mix of the usual OpenGL dx11
apps but we've also got some of the new
DX 12 and Vulcan applications and we're
gonna start off with doom which is brand
new from its author and runs on OpenGL
with Vulcan support coming in the
immediate future
doom is one of the few games where the G
1070 performed slower than the gtx 980ti
and raw frame throughput the two cards
trade blows depending on game and the
1070 often matches evenly or out matches
the gtx 980ti the previous flagship the
gtx 980ti runs about 11.5 percent faster
than the gtx 1070 and raw frame
throughput at 1080p the gtx 1080
ties with the 980ti only because we've
hit a CPU bottleneck and the 1070 sits
below the CPU throttle points hitting
nearly 115 FPS average the tightly times
1% and 0.1% low frame metrics 88.3 and
72.7 respectively against andy's current
high end at single GPU card the gtx 1070
outperforms r9p reacts by about eight
point eight percent or one hundred
fourteen point seven FPS on the 1070
versus 105 average on the pure ax
against the 970 nvidia successor the
1070 pushes an additional 12 point seven
percent of frames per second 1440p
plants the gtx ten saudi firmly within
playable range running above 70 fps and
4k begins to stress the card a little
too much for a perfect fit with regard
to frame times and fluidity moving on to
the division it appears that 1080p
testing is too easy on the gtx 1070 it
doesn't choke the card for framerate
until he moved to higher resolutions at
1440p the gtx 1070 runs at about
eighteen point four percent slower than
the GTX 1080 and about even with the
980ti the tent the 970 sits at fifty
five point seven FPS which is twenty
three point seven percent slower in FPS
than the ten seventy at 1440p 4k is a
little too intense for the gtx 1070 in
the division though the 1080 has a lot
less issue with it and remains the only
single GPU card that can regularly
handle 4k gaming at very high ish
settings and the 1070 could play in 4k
but you have to drop to medium and
lowest settings looking at shadow of
mordor the 1070 holds a strong second
place following the 1080 by 17% and
leading the 980ti by eight point three
percent at 1080p that gets switched
around as the resolution increases with
1440p establishing a massive lead on the
$700 1080 though at these frame rates it
really becomes somewhat irrelevant until
stepping into 4k anyway and pushes the
980 InP reacts beyond the 1070 the 1070
still sits at 77 FPS fully playable and
marks itself and easily
find improvement over the 970 at forty
eight point seven FPS or forty-five
percent different and it's still barely
affordable as well let's move on to dx12
benchmarks so ashes of singularity is
the first of those benchmarks for
simplicity of presentation we've broken
into a few charts with ashes of
singularity the first one shows dx12 is
dx11 performance all this data is from
the satellite shot to a part of the
benchmark and videos gtx 1070 founders
edition lands in second place on the
1080p chart with 10 FPS disparity
between the brand-new $700 1080 and the
$450 1070 that's a fourteen point two
seven percent delta for a couple hundred
dollars the GTX 970 runs approximately
thirty five point one seven percent
slower an average FPS than the ten
seventy and DirectX 12 mode quote
unquote and these are 9p reacts push
significantly lower frame rates with
dx11 something we analyzed and the 1080
review you'll find out again below and
the fury ax eliminates the GTX 10
seventies lead once resolution has
increased this chart next shows the
edges of singularity frame x and that's
the latency between frames this is
comparing dx12 to dx11 performance gains
between architectures so you're looking
at four percent delta versus the
previous generation versus the previous
api and as shown and videos moved to
asynchronous compute algorithms and
compute preemption has assisted
tremendously in its performance gains
over the maxwell generation will explain
compute preemption and NVIDIA async
computes in our 1080 review so if you
want to learn about that again hit that
content the 1070 sees benefits and
architectural changes to data path
organization and compute preemption
ultimately yielding an additional 28.3%
frame time improvements over DX 11 this
isn't quite as good as the GTX 1080 is
near 50% gains but it's still pretty
damn good Andy of course it looks about
120 percent gains the X 11 to 12 with
the pure e^x but a lot about is just
because of Andy's tremendously low
performance in DX 11 next up is Vulcan
with the Talos principle at 1440p the
gtx 1070 performance still stands above
the 60fps mark well above it in fact
with 110 FPS average on Vulcan
and 119 average on dx11 and even manages
to hold marginally about 60fps
performance at 4k the
eighty performance for GTX 1070 runs
12.2% slower than the GTX ten 82.6%
faster than the 980 I reference and
that's a difference that pre overclocked
980 eyes would overcome the last gen
Maxwell GTX 970 runs about 37% slower
than the 1070 we've made a big deal out
of overclocking on the new Pascal
architecture with our GC X 1080 review
and part of that is because we toured
the thing apart and through a liquid
cooler on there to see just how far we
can actually push it once the thermals
were accounted for so the things that
changed here first of all it's on boost
3.0 now which is a new version of
Nvidia's boost technology and that does
change things a little bit for
overclocking including the introduction
of scan OC on EVGA precision which means
that you'll be able to sort of semi
automatically scan for and set your
overclock including a frequency versus
voltage curve that's brand new we don't
use that though we do the tried and
trued true sort of basic overclocking
method which is really just slider
tuning so you tune the core clock memory
clock and then the voltage as necessary
along with fan RPMs or just throw a
liquid cool around there and that's how
we do our overclocking for these tests
but let's look at the table with our
stepping results for overclocking this
table shows our progress stepping as we
tested each modification to the GPU our
final tested results burned in with an
endurance test and stayed strong in 1987
megahertz core 4608 megahertz in memory
and that's a 215 megahertz overclock on
the core and 600 megahertz overclock on
the memory which only seemed limited by
V BIOS and voltage regulation at this
point not necessarily an uncommon thing
while you're looking at now are the
performance charts for that to overclock
some games saw more than a 25 percent
performance increase but the range was a
more reasonable 9 to 30% GTA 5 at 4k
benefited from a 12 point 6 percent gain
on the 1070 with a 1080 benefiting 14
point 8 percent on the EFI cooler mordor
at 4k a twenty nine point nine percent
hike at 1080p and at 1440p that was
still 22.3% with the 1070 overclocked
doom at 1080p moves into the 120 Hertz
playable range with a nine point two
percent jaunt to 125 point 7 FPS average
the GP 104 - 200 it shipped runs cooler
by nature of its simplified die
and it's lower overall clock rates but
there are other things to look at too so
the 1070 trades blows with a 980ti and
that difference could be made up for in
some cases by a pre overclocked AIB
version of the 980 I so do keep that in
mind
overall the 1070 is a good improvement
over the 970 from the previous Maxwell
generation and that improvement measures
about maximally maybe 30 percent but we
do see a pretty good range and they're
depending on a lot of things like the
game but generally you see about a 30%
Delta between the 970 and the 1070 until
pushing it to high resolution so 1440p
is a good example of that
the 1070 creates a new emergent class of
1440p ready cards for 60fps plus gaming
and this is something that the 1080 did
for 4k as well where it's finally
exceeded 60fps on a single GPU with the
1080 and the 1070 does that for 1440p as
for the founders edition Carter taking
the same stance of this as we took with
1080 founders Edition card and that is
you should wait for the AV models so the
AIB models we priced and the 350 to 450
dollar range brothers the fe card is
priced at $450 so that price difference
is enough to justify the purchase of an
AI v card because it's a good good
amount of different you'll save more
money put it towards something else the
IB cards of course will also be better
overclockers in some regard when looking
at things like heat versus noise so if
you're trying to reduce your noise
levels but also overclock that sometimes
difficult with the reference cars
because the blower fan has to increase
and its RPM so that's a big thing to
look at I would suggest waiting for the
AIB cards other than that the 1070 is a
good chip it performs well for us where
you would want it to be and if you're
playing at 1440p that makes it
exceptionally good because nothing
really exists at this price point I can
do 1440p right now so in that regard
this is setting a new standard for
Nvidia I would not buy it for 1080p
you're good buying something cheaper for
that because this is just overkill for
1080p in almost all instances so that is
