talk about his what is this darish
nellis dis duel socket system der velt
you guys just like give up when you're
making your language like you just you
got to the 1700s and just stopped just
just duel socket system yeah absolutely
I mean sometimes I'm thinking about the
name and I don't even know how to say it
in German it's really bad it's really
bad so this is the fastest system in the
world apparently it's got two threader
four CPUs sorry epic CPUs excuse me it's
definitely not the same thing - epic
CPUs and it's a 7600 132 core part so
two of those a whole bunch of RAM and a
massive motherboard that you haven't
seen the likes of before it's actually a
custom shape it's kind of got an L shape
to it
so very interesting that there Bowers
gonna walk us through some of the
overclocking process on this system
before that this video is brought to you
by the EVGA CLC 280 liquid cooler people
ask me how I keep cool during the summer
with all this hair well I've tried a lot
of different products and if you do
exactly what I need many of them cause
tangles or worse EVGA CLC 280 helps keep
my core temperatures low they're in hot
benchmarking sessions the CLC 280 is
price competitive and focuses on
performance for value offering a 280
liquid cooler at an affordable price get
yours at the link in the description
below hair mounting kit sold separately
so where do we even start with this
I mean what's what's the background here
I mean so the background was that a
friend came up to me and said hey do you
know that it's possible to overclock
epic and I was like wait what and so we
tried it first on a single socket Super
Micro board which worked out fairly okay
I mean it's a okay board then we bought
a dual sockets Super Micro board then we
bought a second dual socket micro Super
Micro board because we could not ever
get it to boot on the first one because
we have so many issues with this socket
it's amazing that you have to mount the
CPU ten times to get all memory channels
to boot up on the super micro board we
never never managed to do it
luckily on the zeus board it worked
fine like we had some initial problems
but once you like mounted it two times
it worked fine so that's already a huge
progress and yes yes building is a good
start and getting this to boot took us
like two or three days so there was the
first challenge getting it to boot in I
mean in general this main board is
amazing if you look at the components
especially if you look at the VRMs what
is really impressive is the fact that
there are more faces and the bigger vrm
for the memory sticks than for the CPUs
I mean it's mainly because you have
those high-density sticks like 128
gigabyte per Tim and if you pluck the
whole bunch in here you have 32 slots
they take a lot of power so yeah erm for
the memory is really impressive what's
also very impressive is that on the
right side from you guys on the left
side we have all those eight pin
connectors and we first thought those
are like additional CPU power but they
are VGA power so if we want to plug in
VGA cards in the bottom we have to power
those but they're also connected to the
CPU power plane so we could plug them to
give the CPU additional power which we
first thought might be necessary turns
out that the PSU is are strong enough so
we have two 800 watts PS use in there
looking at the shape like they're really
small but they're also really really
powerful so yeah I was really amazed by
how much power this server really
delivers so is it is it split for one
PSU per CPU or is it just all all
together no so you can power the whole
rig with one PSU only it's always going
for the full thing so we tried that
first only one PSU then we overclock the
CPUs and then we had OCP on the CPU I
own a PS you because if you overclock
them we have 400 250 watt per CPU so let
me plug them both and it works fine so
and so you mentioned GPU imagine how you
have extra power headers just for the
GPU I should know he's got the most
advanced CPU in the world and here at GP
107
it's actually not been announced this
week that is not on the card
you're missing the Novak fluid though so
the plan here I guess there was some
shipping difficulty with it right I mean
it's gotta travel for an event and it's
not uncommon for issues to happen with
anything that's liquid so the plan as I
understand it is for now it's just the
glue is drying but we'll have hopefully
some footage from later on tonight when
it's been filled with the Novak
7100 fluid so what is 71 I know there's
different types of Novak what's the
boiling point on 7170 100 is 61 degrees
Celsius as I said before yeah so we had
some transportation issues because it's
a it's a croolik box ten millimeter
thick acrylic it's fairly strong but
still like one of the sides cracked open
when it arrived so I had to reglue it
the glue takes 24 hours to harden so on
the first day we have to leave it leave
it empty but then we will fill it and
it's it's really impressive it looks so
impressive and it's not just for fun we
need this stuff to cool the vrm when we
did the first video with a single
circuit board we actually poured Novik
all the time on a vrm because the vrm is
not made for 500 watt power consumption
right so that's why we need the Nova in
there and it's not only that it's also
to protect the components from
condensation because this is all hooked
up to a chiller we're we're all fans of
chillers you know yeah some of us more
public than others but yeah I mean some
say it some don't so it's hooked up to a
chiller a chiller is stored in this box
and obviously if we go below room
temperature we will have condensation
but if we fill this with Novik mainly we
have to know it fluid on the board which
is protecting the board but then you
also have the gas in there which is
pushing out all the oxygen all the water
that's in the air so we don't have
condensation if this is filled with
Novik that's the big point so you just
fill it to the top and then it doesn't
need to go through a condensation
process because we saw your phase change
loop phase shift I think you called it
so it sounds a bit different from that
you're just filling this to the top yeah
I mean we just we just feel this for the
yeah for the sake of protecting the
components it's completely different
approach
very interesting so overclocking then
what kind of control do you even have
with epoch it's not like the thread
Ripper rising our Intel desktops up what
do you have to do so in general there
several limitations so first of all I
mean basically the board has a very low
OCP should be something like 300 watts
or 250 watts and so we first have to
disable osep which is not that easy but
we have an i2c connector directly next
to the vrm controller so we can hook up
an EVC from elmore which is an i2c
device it will also be on sale we just
make that for enthusiasts like you guys
so end of this year I think you can buy
it and so with the EBC we can disable
the OCP then there is also a voltage
limitation so epoch is voltage locked as
well so if you try it a normal software
for pushing the voltage I think you're
kept at one point 3 volts so that's the
limit so we also have to bypass the
voltage limit with the EVC and then
obviously there is the overclocking
limitation because epic is not meant to
be overclocked but I cannot disclose it
for now because we might still need this
for epic 2 and we don't want it to be
locked so yeah fair enough so what do
some special hoops together working it
sounds like anything else you want to
talk about here I mean the wait what
about we haven't talked about
performance at all so what have you done
mostly for benchmarks how does it
compare to the next most powerful system
I mean it's the most powerful dual
socket system the height the highest
Cinebench Nellist
dual socket system tear valves thank you
very much
yeah I mean next time we will just make
a video in German on my channel how
about that it sounds a little
intimidating
romance that was the top comment so we
quick sidetrack here
Rowan and I were reading some of the
comments from the previous video we were
in and the first one that he saw us
something like best pro man's 2018 or
something like that so I really
appreciate that comment whoever wrote
that props you well de hann alright so
performance how does it compare to other
stuff it's really really fast so the
thing is to like stock performance would
be something like 6,000 roughly in
points in a bench we achieved over
10,000 which shows how much those cpu
are capable of if AMD would unlock them
and then there's also the limit in the
memory sticks so those are 2666 memory
sticks in bios of this board we can go
up to like 3,200 but it does not apply
because the CPUs are locked and we're
also hitting a memory limit at this
point because we figure out that if we
overclock the CPU is higher from 10,000
points in Cinebench it does not scale
anymore so it seems like there is some
other bandwidth limitation it's most
likely memory yeah yeah
so for power consumption once you start
really pushing these to the frequencies
you're at what how much does power
consumption change it's double so going
from typically those CPUs are like
roughly 1 volt voltage and 2.2 to 2.8
gigahertz depending on load we pushed it
to 40 yards 1.4 volt and then we have
500 volt power consumption per CPU and
what was the what's the stock frequency
amazed
yeah 2.2 to 2.8 roughly yeah okay
fluctuating a lot very impressive
anything else you want to note here
about this or about your booth here at K
skin I think we're pretty much done like
literally cool so we got it all there's
nothing left to see here if anyone else
uploads videos from case Kane's booth
don't even bother you heard it from
Roman first thank you for watching
ro and they get rich oh hey me thank you
for the video man yeah and we'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
