project this time with the gtx 1060 you
might be asking why would you put that
under liquid it's a gtx 1060 and the
reason is because I want to so there's a
few things here first of all taking this
apart will be a good opportunity to
learn more about the board itself beyond
what we can just see by looking at the
back of it of course so we're going to
take it apart look at the board that's
what this part of the video is for is
really just learning about the PCB
itself and then the second part we'll
build up a hybrid card and run through
some tests look at thermals things like
that so in terms of the thermals we ran
pretty extensive endurance tests with
the GTX 1060 before we get into the
build this coverage is brought to you by
MSI and the new msi gtx 1060 gaming X
which comes pre overclocked and has a
twin frozer six heatsink so we ran
pretty extensive endurance tests on the
GTX 1060 and the MSI gaming X version of
the 1060 in those endurance tests in the
article and in the review video to some
extent I show a couple of interesting
data points so one is over the period of
hour to plus hour burnin we see that the
founders Edition card this one has some
spiky performance like that it's a small
spike but it is a spike and that does
actually very slightly impact clock rate
where it impacts clock rate more heavily
is when there's these sudden really hard
drops and we can put the graphs on
screen for that but the those hard drops
with the efi card fall down to 150 ish
megahertz from the original clock rate
of whatever it happened to be at a time
1700 plus in some instances so when you
follow more than a thousand megahertz
has one gigahertz fall in the operating
clock there's a pretty sudden and
observable spike and frame rate that'll
be a stutter or frame drop or whatever
colloquialism you want to use so that
was somewhat resolved with the
aftermarket coolers in the past when we
did these hybrid mods we were able to
eliminate those hard drops completely
but if you look at the msi card's
performance which we also endurance
tested you'll see that it does not have
these smaller spikes at the front of the
chart it's actually almost
perfectly flat and it does have the hard
falls but it gets rid of the smaller
ones and so that I think is partly
because of the thermal solution even
though this one is pretty decent
comparatively to the other Effie cards
that's just because GP 106 is a lot
lower TDP and not quite as a hot of a
chip so two reasons for doing this one
is because we want to look at it and and
it's fun and two is because it might
actually improve things in some regard
we might be able to get rid of some of
those those drops I do not think we're
going to see a huge change in
overclocking but in the past with the
MDR x4 81 we did this end with whatever
card we just did before that the 1080 we
did actually see some legitimately
sizable increases in the overclocking
ability and that was mostly in the form
of an extra 100 mega Hertz with 1080 and
an extra 50 mega Hertz with the rx 480
and even look at this so like the
previous cards I haven't taken this
apart yet that means I'm not 100% sure
of how it goes together or what we're
getting into with this card but the one
thing we do know is that the backplate
here is if you look right here at these
four screws these larger ones these are
going through the PCB and holding the
heatsink in place so the heatsink is
going to be an alloy / copper heat pipe
amalgam that's used to cool the GPU of
course and then flanking that will be
whatever's used to cool the vrm the vram
likely the base plate of the card
there's a screw there
much normally there's not two sets of
screws like that student Pokemon themes
on oh let's take these at it didn't
change the screw oh there goes something
separating there's a screw right here I
didn't see that one need that two more
up top
so it looks like it's about to separate
yeah it goes so there's the Shroud let's
disconnect the LEDs as some reports out
there did say that there were no LEDs on
the 1060 I've seen both LEDs and non
LEDs reported ours for whatever it's
worth does have an LED for the gtx text
there at the top which is just powered
by this cable simple to pin cable that
goes into the board and powers that so
we're going to set that aside that's the
shroud it looks like this did not
necessarily need to be unscrewed but I
think when we install the liquid cooler
might be helpful to have them separated
anyway and at this point it looks like
there's just a Philips head right there
that I can take out to separate them
completely but we'll leave that out two
more down here leave that there for now
we've got a very similar heatsink to the
1080 and 1070 where it's got this sort
of arched out look to it and that
conforms with the vrm fan this pattern
right here this plastic moulding is
helping guide the airflow into the
heatsink and through where it's ejected
out the back of the card and that's very
standard blower design cooling solution
this is just some kind of cheap it's not
a knot of plastic but that top is just a
covering it doesn't actually I don't
think it's actually functional it's the
stuff underneath that matters and we'll
get there in a moment
if you look at all this that's ketchup
and mustard wiring in here that is what
allows the six pin to be located off of
the PCB so you see the six pins right
there but if you look at this this is
the PCB the PCB terminates right there
I think this card is almost 10 inches
fully across and that is I believe like
six point seven five or something so it
terminates early but Nvidia didn't want
to put a PCI header in the middle of
their card so you can see these solder
points to solder points here
then the wires for those points are here
and they're extending out this way which
allows the pass-through effectively for
power to come into the card what's this
for doesn't even have intake I'm curious
about what this does to well we'll see
when we get in there I guess there's
really no components down there because
the PCB doesn't exist so maybe it's a
maybe just cooling for the power I'm not
sure how hot that stuff gets but if you
look here this gives the appearance that
and it's correct that these are fins so
these are aluminum fins so it gives the
appearance that air can come in through
here and then get pushed through the vrm
fan that's how you would think it would
work and in a case like that
origen Chronos where we had some thermal
issues on the GPU I thought that this
exposure would have benefited because it
was closer to the ventilation but if you
look here this a sort of ridge line that
I'm pointing out right now this ridge
line is actually solid so down in the
card there's a wall there's no way for
any wind effectively to get through
there
it looks like anyway so maybe cooling
something it might be functional it
might be mostly cosmetic but if it's
cooling anything that's probably the the
PCIe connector which is probably one of
the hottest parts of the card of course
is cuz that's where all the power is
going in for the most part so cool stuff
let's take the heatsink off and look at
the rest I guess we want the plate off
so that's secure that is secured by
these screws do we have to take this off
yeah we do have to take this off to get
the heatsink out so I want to leave the
base plate intact this time to make
things a little easier I don't I don't
think we need the extra vram cooling and
in theory it'll be a more efficient vrm
cooler anyway but we're still going to
take it off completely just to look at
what the card looks like metal I'll put
it back on before we build the hybrid
model completely
all right there we go there are no heat
pipes in here so I someone said there
were heat pipes but that appears that
appears to be incorrect I don't know if
the camera will be able to see down
there but if you kind of look down the
fins you'll see that there are actually
there's nothing in there so that let go
is clean through is just aluminum fins
copper cold plate there are no copper
heat pipes and that's our cooling
solution really not great but obviously
it's doing the job just fine because
this is a low TDP chip 120 watt TDP the
heat generation is pretty low we're
hitting 70 something Celsius Mac 71 C
with the auto pre-configured settings
this is plainly a cooling solution for
the vrm components and we've got chokes
MOSFETs things like that and then
underneath will be the vram I'm going to
grab something to clean off that that
module though first are the silicon
rather it's just as many of you know
just rubbing alcohol well it pretty much
instantly remove compound won't cause
any damage and it dries almost instantly
this is GP 106 - 400 as an FYI the GTX
1080 is GP 104 and the 1070 is GP 104
but they also have a suffix - 200 and -
400 so this is GP 106 400 there may be
in the future a GP 106 to 100 if such a
thing exists it would probably be maybe
a gtx 1050 or something like that but
that's the the silicon that is the GPU
this is the substrate that green thing
right there that's what you call a
substrate let's get this cold plate off
- look at the rest of it though or the
the base plate might be just held on by
this at this point the expansion slot
okay Oh
backside okay so I'm going to use some
anti-static tape for very simple purpose
one it's anti-static so we don't have to
worry about it causing damage to these
screws are slightly different size and
the other ones you don't want to forget
where they go so I'm just going to tape
them in to their location where they
belong
that way they won't they will leave it
when I'm ready to reassemble this thing
later okay
that's the expansion cover with the
tessellation and all that uselessness so
did that actually do anything for us or
was it a waste of time oh it did do it
okay so there is a separation what are
we stuck to we are stuck by the wires
I think that's annoying
I think this is where we can detach this
part of the syste heatsink all right
there's the heatsink or something anyway
oh that's going to be fun to put back
together as that this that goes in here
something like that like not exactly but
you get the idea and then this has now
separated we've got a huge connector
soldered straight to the the pins you
can see the black ones are ground so
we've got to ground or sense pins and
the rest are hot so that has allowed us
to separate these I think except for the
fan we can we got to detach the fan
first to be looking here you'll see that
this twisted pair cable
is actually going to the fan connected
by a header that's kind of Sokka didn't
latched in there so we're going to just
kind of push it and then see if it pulls
up you really do not
don't pull by the cables if you can
avoid it I'm trying to pull by the bass
here now that you should be copying on
any of this to be honest I'm sure this
is far better ways to do this once the
teardown is a more known process
I guess this goes in there I know what
that does it's my phone hold code
anywhere on screen to focus there's just
an inventory number what we've got here
is of VRAM thermal pads which are
connecting with a little piece of
aluminum or something under under each
pad which is actually pretty good design
it's a little plate under each one of
these you can actually kind of see it
there if I expose the corner the vram is
making that or the thermal pad is making
that contact to the vram obviously a GP
goes here these just got stuck on but
you can see where there were more of
them and those are still on the board as
these are attached to parts of the power
phasing set up the VRM MOSFETs things
like that and what else do we have it's
of interest because we can point out the
vram itself of course so one two three
four five six gigabytes one gigabyte
chips and just as a reference they are
Samsung and they are actually the same
chips used in the RX 4 80 the - HC -
five i think is what that number says
same more or less the same chips if not
the same exact chips as in the RX 480
you can see there's two spots here that
were kind of discussed by another vendor
those two slots do not have chips in
them that does not really mean anything
it just means that the same PCB was used
and they didn't want to redesign it they
just left those blank so that's what we
got let's kind of weird being tethered
like this you can see ground soldered in
electrical electrical
and 2k caps with I forget what the other
one is I remember if that's five or ten
but we've got two K caps for sure and I
think that's I mean that's really it
this board is pretty simple and small so
at this point we can start getting ready
to mount a liquid cooler to it so that's
the teardown that's what we got in there
for the card the way this is going to go
back together in the next segment we are
just going to reassemble this part I
think I've got everything figured out
word jokes again so reassemble that this
will help dissipate the heat on the VRM
so hopefully that will be beneficial to
us so we don't have to mount a thousand
tiny aluminum and copper heat sinks like
we did on the rx 480 and it should
theoretically work pretty well because
we already have seen this cooler
performs pretty well so mount that if it
will support this if it doesn't then I'm
going to go with probably probably the
Arctic cooling solution again this thing
but no matter what I'm going to mount
one it actually let's just check right
now before we sign off on this video and
see whether this will fit these are the
best possible solutions for closed-loop
liquid cooling that I've tested right
now because that protrusion I just show
you again even though we've done it in
every video that protrusion down there
really helps with the flat surface of a
GPU as opposed to the more curved
surface of a CPU which has different hot
spots you want that flat surface the
protrusion will help sink the heat so
that it's actually sinking a significant
amount of heat saturating across the
surface before the pump pushes the
liquid in here through the micro fins on
the other side of the cold plate we'll
take one of these apart sometimes here
and show you what that looks like but
that's the idea let's see if the Pens
will fit yeah that might actually work
maybe we'll see it could work
find out in the next video so that's it
that's it for the teardown now you know
what the gtx 1060 looks like see this
correctly so don't ruin the thermal
paste either what the 1060 looks like on
the PCB and the chip itself next video
will be the build up will work on
testing and things like that see if
there's any elimination of those spiky
clock rates and the temperature should
fall to I would think 18 Celsius or
lower for the delta T value load which
is pre pretty damn low the reason I
picked that number is because that's
what our 1080 hybrid hit was about 18
Celsius delta T and this is a much
cooler chip so I'm curious to see how
low it goes but pay challeng the postal
