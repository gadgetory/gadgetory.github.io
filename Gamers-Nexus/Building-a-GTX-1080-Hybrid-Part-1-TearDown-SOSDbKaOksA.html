apart a GTX 1080 we just posted the
review of this obviously I'm sure most
of you have seen it by now so we're
going to take this apart this is a $700
project that cannot go wrong and as such
I've taken a couple precautions here for
anti-static discharge so you've got an
ESD safe mat this is a proper mat that's
got the mesh inside of it to dissipate
any voltage that comes off may your
current that comes off me so to keep the
static electricity off the card I'm
gonna be wearing one of these ESD
bracelets that goes into the wall it's
connected to ground and then anything
coming out of my arm in terms of
electricity will sink into this mat and
just dissipate through the mesh so we've
got that covered I'm gonna take this
apart and keep very close track of
everything so this is actually from a
980ti which I took this this apart
previously you can see right here this
is a 980ti and it was pretty successful
came apart easily the process looks like
it has not changed just from glancing at
the 1080 we have not practiced this so
this is a dry run here and hopefully
everything works out pretty well so the
GTX 1080 just basic specs that are
important to note are that it is first
of all a 2560 GP 104 kuduk work hard and
it's brand new $700 for the founders
edition this is the founders Edition
different from the AIB version from the
board partners and the board partners
will be shipping as low as 600 within
MSRP anyway and then of course we'll see
pretty high numbers probably all the way
up to like 750 or something for for a
hybrid card which we are actually going
to create and that is a large reason for
this project so we're gonna create our
own hybrid GTX not 1080 and this is just
a start this is the teardown in the next
video will be the build up and the
testing for the hybrid version of the
card so let's start by taking this thing
apart and marking where all the screws
go so we're going to start by removing
the plates on the card it's got a couple
of brackets here there's this weird
shaped bracket on the top that doesn't
really serve as far as I'm aware any
real mechanical
purpose but it does need to come off I
think it locks into the sort of mounting
bracket underneath and that's about it
sort of take that off using a what is
that some number three I think Allen key
might be a two point five but it looks
like a three to me so we're gonna do
that next we'll move on to what the one
on the underside there's an identical
version of this on the underside which
I'll show you okay so we got the screws
out for this and this will actually pull
out I think it's got an adhesive on
there so you will have difficulty
getting a back on later if you want to
get it back on the exact same way that
comes off and then here's that one on
the bottom that I was talking about was
the same exact thing and what we're
gonna do just to keep everything clean
is mark on the magnetic project mat over
here where the pieces go so I'm just
going to draw that shape so I remember
later that these screws go there so put
these two there and unscrew the bottom
one as well alright so I'm gonna stop
for a second because it was hard to get
some of the screws out and I don't want
to dig at them with this crappy terrible
tool use better tools than I am by the
way so what we're gonna do is magnetize
it and this is just a giant magnet from
a motor from a printer motor and you
could use a hard drive magnet as well
all you have to do is get the tool
you're on a magnetized put it in there
do that for a second and should be
magnetized after that so pretty cool
trick if you did not know it obviously
you don't want to put something as
powerful as this motor magnet near a
hard drive or any kind of permanent
media because it will destroy it so
we've got those off and I'm just gonna
mark this on our sheet as well so
there's our two screws for the bottom
plate two screws for the top plate and
those were just the easy ones to
cherry-pick let's figure out the best
approach to taking this thing apart I've
not taken one of these apart yet
obviously it's brand new so these I can
tell you right now these four goats the
pomp block or well it's not a pump
because it's not a liquid card but
rather the cold play the alloy heatsink
right here
that you can see through the acrylic
that alloy a heatsink is mounted by
these four Phillips head screws and then
the rest there's a bunch of really tiny
screws I think I have a tool that can do
that
that holds on the back plate and this
back plate is sort of like the 981 which
I happen to have over here off to the
side
this 980 back plate up here there's one
screw spot you can see this stands out a
bit more than the rest of the back plate
that's because that comes off to give
more breathability for SLI I don't think
it really did a lot for the 980 and but
for the 1080 they decided to change it
for this entire half of the back plate
so you just take that whole thing off I
don't think it does not look like we'll
have to remove that to do what I want to
do later which is install a liquid pump
so that looks like it can stay there so
let's go ahead and just start work the
most obvious with these it looks like
number four that's a five number four
Allen screws something like that yes
that is what it is this one's actually
very loose curious if someone else came
in here first yeah this is a four or a
five it's a some kind of millimeter
allen key but I put that there
go diagonal opposing corners for every
screw from now on this is what I just a
rule I have because if you hit something
that is is under some torque
particularly anything like a heat sink
for a CPU or GPU you will want to we go
opposing corners and that is just to
make sure that the the torque spreads
out evenly over the device as you're
removing it or installing it and does
not cause any damage so we can do those
up there that's right there or something
like that so we've gotten the four
screws off for the main part of the
shroud that's the sort of left side of
the shroud this part looks like it's a
separate piece of plastic which as
you'll see in this box I've got is
actually true for the 980ti as well
so this is our 980ti this is the 980 i
if you've ever wanted to see a box of a
$650 video card these are the parts left
over from one of them so this is the old
heatsink for the 980 I and one thing I
really want to do is play with this heat
sink on the 1080 if it fits and see if
there new one actually has any real
changes because they've said that it
actually performs much better so I want
to validate that statement that's the
acrylic plate this is the shroud for the
980ti
and that was the left side of it and I
can actually just do this for you and
then that's the right side of it and it
mounts together like that with these
sort of feet that socket together and
then you've got this part of it as well
for the front that mounts in there so
you've got these two screws that hold
this down these two screws that hold
these pieces together right here these
two screws mount into it looks like not
the heatsink but it mounts to something
in there and then there are a couple of
screws on the underside as well and this
if you look at these two it's basically
the exact same thing they've just
tessellated or they stopped the render
process when they're generating the
shroud so same mounting points though it
all works very similar today we're going
to put that away
and follow the procedure used for the
980ti which is next going to be to
remove the small screw that's right here
on the underside of the card so this is
starting to get loose now I can feel it
beginning to give but it's not released
quite yet we need to undo the one at the
top here it's the same size allen screw
and and then we will be pretty close to
pulling this thing completely apart at
least for the shroud so you can see my
magnetic project mat over here is
beginning to get pretty filled in with
the plate you'll definitely want to copy
that if you do this project yourself
because that will help you significantly
in reassembling it if something goes
wrong you also want to really make sure
you're not stripping any screws which is
very easily done with these right here
I'm not sure if these are magnetic so
they not sure what kind of screw
but it's a very soft metal for these
these smaller head screws so you want to
be really careful about not stripping
those and our next part of the process
you can see this plate is now the
acrylic is not loose it's the only thing
holding it in there is the force from
the the two pieces of the shroud holding
it down which we go this answers our
earlier question is these screws hold
the plate down so that's all those do
let's remove these two because I know
these two sock it into the the main part
of the shroud on the left as we saw with
the 980ti once we got these two out and
the next two out
I think it'll pull apart but I'm not
positive I think it's although so the
card is obviously still held together
somehow I've been pulling on this a
little bit and there's obviously a screw
in there somewhere
normally the the rear i/o area does
actually have a screw that's important
and there's there's a couple of them
some of them need to be removed and some
don't need to be removed because we
don't actually have to take this this
part of the expansion slot out it's just
not important for our purposes so I am
going to reference the 980ti box again
blocks of cannibalized parts from the
980ti
and just before you call the PDF eat
equivalent for hardware this is actually
still a functioning card so let's see
we've got here this looks like are all
these screws in so all the screws for
the nine ATI it looks like I left in or
I reinserted for the hybrid block once
we installed that and I'm not seeing an
obvious reason to remove any of these
just from first glance actually if I can
see some separation back here oh oh
there it goes okay cool so we're
actually good to go on the 1080 and see
that starting to pull apart so we're
just gonna unlock the satisfying
unlocking of the 1080 that you can get
let's give this nine eighty parts out of
here again and just for sake of
comparison so they said they changed
they're heatsink let's take a look at
that and see if they did I'm gonna clean
this off a little bit before I found the
anti-static mat so here's the old
heatsink there's the new on looks like
there are actually some changes to it so
there's some cosmetic changes and it
looks like there are some performance
changes but we'll we'll know when we
look further into it
now I've already done the thermal bench
marks on this as part of the review so
we know how it performs and it is it's
on the chart somewhere you'll see a
chart on there in the review but they're
pretty close to each other a degree or
two I think so we've got a bunch of
small screws in here that are holding
things down we'll have to be careful
about those let's let's get the rest of
the shroud apart how is this held on
looks like this is still being held on
somewhere so I'm going to look for that
so I think what I've decided is that
these tiny screws are probably holding
things together and I do remember taking
a bunch of screws like this out of the
980 I previously said they do have to
come out at some point to get all the
way down to the GPU very small screws
that do not misplace these I'm gonna
stick them all up in the top corner of
my mat and just make a note that these
go into the underside of the shroud
let's just say this block is for a
shroud underside just so I know where
those go take this one I'm doing
opposing opposing corners again as much
as possible anyway there are four screws
holding this part of the the card
together I'm gonna flip this over now
and start preparing to remove the actual
heatsink itself which is secured by
these four large screws so this is where
it's well that is very that's very loose
that's kind of curious those aren't bad
those are all those are all factory
tight this one was pretty loose but
we're going to take this apart it is a
spring-loaded set of screws do opposing
corners because that's applying tension
to the PCB
and it's pretty pretty low force but
it's just better to be safe and not
apply any undue force at odd angles to a
$700 video card so we've got all of
those out I think I just felt that
heatsink fall out of the card yes just
beginning to fall apart there it goes
so there is the new heatsink you can see
the thermal compound is on there of
course though it's pretty pretty fresh
as it is a brand new card pushed out to
the sides of it and then in terms of
heatsink design are these are actually
reasonably different I mean yeah I'm
gonna clean this off so if you want to
do this yourself you can just get any
kind of paper towel and rubbing alcohol
and rub that off I actually didn't use
any rubbing alcohol looks like it's
pretty any new still so there's the new
heatsink versus the old the old one is
the one right here so that's the old
heatsink for the 980ti not the 980 I
think the 980 is pretty similar here is
a 980 that's assembled for reference and
it looks like there's a couple cosmetic
changes here I don't know if that really
impacts performance or not it's thermal
is pretty sensitive so it's certainly
possible that an extra channel like that
would impact performance but I was
looking mostly cosmetic to be honest
looks like the rest of its all pretty
similar design I know there's a vapor
chambers set up in this thing somewhere
but we might have to start drilling
Trillian stuff apart and cutting holes
to find that so to explain this sort of
nomenclature bit and video obviously the
company Taiwan where it was fab and then
it looks like that might be a specific
model numbers and they but the GPU
itself is GP 104 and it's the subversion
- 400 a one is the rev so that is the
revision number so a in the hardware
industry is used universally as a
meaning it's a consumer-ready product as
opposed to an ex rev if you saw X 1 what
X 1 or X 2 or X 0 means is that it's a
it's sort of a lab sample so X is a
example it's not really consumer ready
that's something that's being tested
internally this is a one so obviously
ready to go it's a full version of the
card it was not some internal version
that we were sampled this is actually
the retail product but we're ready to
take the rest of the shout off now so
this thing came loose as I took off the
the heatsink so the heatsink was what
was keeping this down and pull that off
now and that is the container this is
actually a good bit different that is
the container for the blower fan the
previous container is right here so they
are got similarities where it matters
they've got this enclosure here but that
feels like metal enclosure to keep the
keep the airflow going where and video
wanted it to go which is basically
contain it within the card and then this
heatsink off to the far right side over
here far right side over here is the vrm
heatsink I think the voltage regulator
module lives under there so let's let's
go ahead and finish this teardown
process the VRMs under here I want to
see what that looks like I want to see
what the GDR 5 X memory looks like this
is attached as you'll see that's just
hot wiring to ground wire and that just
powers the LED this is it's backlit if
you want to change the LEDs you could
come down to this level and start
pulling this apart and change your LEDs
there where you just paint that part of
the card of course it may be easier but
let's just go ahead and disconnect that
from the board ideally you don't pull on
the cables but I don't know if I'm gonna
have a better way of doing this without
more precision instrument than I've got
on the table right now we're gonna go
ahead and pull on the cables I would
advise against that but we're gonna do
that for this video
next part looks like a couple screws for
the far right side of the shadder far
left from my perspective these are our
Phillips screws and that's not a big
enough screwdrivers I don't want to
strip them
okay so we've built a new screwdriver to
take this out that looks better
cool I'm gonna magnetize this like I
showed you earlier okay there we go
there's the second screw I'm gonna put
these on the mats these go inside the
fan more or less what's next oh there's
that so we just just by accident figured
out how to pull this off that is
different than the old one the old one I
think was adhered to it so there's the
little tab that tiny tab just sockets in
right here and then there's three of
them and you apply downward pressure to
get it in there so that's how that comes
off as you'll see it a casualty earlier
on a $700 video card luckily not a
functional part so if you pull those off
make sure you do it right none socket
this one as well what's left of it
anyway alright so that just pulls up and
out crazy glue it later so it looks like
I'm gonna have to take off the backplate
to get to whatever screws are holding
down the remainder of this coil this
might be too big no it works nice these
spins I guarantee you one of these
things will get lost these are actually
they've got threadlocker on this it's
got blue thread lock on it so I guess if
you wanted to rebuild it factory for any
reason if you're taking one apart make
sure you put thread lock on there
because that's something they'd notice
Oh found it her kid this is basically
exactly why you magnetize a screwdriver
by the way so here's our last screw I
think for the right side of the
backplate well that's easy that's just
that just slides right off so you kind
of pressure there and pull that up
there's the underside very shiny no real
thermal properties there I'm sure sure
does something but I don't know if it's
good or bad or notice
well what do we have here what are these
screws it's like a very tiny allen key
so uh for lack of better tools we tried
a couple things here try it
hex drivers to get these out but I don't
have any that are smaller enough I don't
know if I have a head of any kind that
can get in there I don't know if it's
even something that exists but it looks
like we can maybe try try some needle
nose pliers your lack of something
closer that's spinning just like that's
spinning spinning so we've got the
world's worst solution to taking these
out you probably shouldn't do it this
way I'm sure there's a poor precision
tool but I'd have to walk that you get
it cool so there we go that's the first
one there's a two three four five six
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
thirteen of these that hold off the hold
on the the base of the card here so
these are underside
I hope a bunch of people counts out how
they're cringing nice there's several
more oh my god I've made a discovery
holy crap that's so much easier come out
well that's good while it lasted so in
the excitement of discovering that this
screwdriver had come out and create a
much better tool for the job
hex driver with the appropriate size one
of the screws got sucked in hey come on
man
I know that this unscrews is it all the
same container maybe oh I think it is
what there's like three more in there
what's in there can you see with your
light no really
oh let's see if we can get the rest out
do this get this part down and figure
that out after yeah so now only one can
get stuck in the hair cuz there's
already one ahead in theory
so now it's holding it in gottoms
so now it looks like getting to the end
of this not all these screws are
relevant I believe it might only be this
one and maybe one other backplate screw
that one certainly is because it's
connected right to that black shroud
okay
might be a that might be it
there's your i/o which we could already
see but that will allow us to pull and
separate the rest of it once we figure
out what's still holding it on got this
out had to use the hex driver for two
other screws and now I think we can
finally separate the card that's a lot
of thermal pads so I wanna be careful
here that's what we've got it looks like
for the GTX 1080
proper that's what it looks like I'll
leave that we can actually disconnect
that really easily lots of thermal pads
those are adhered to it looks like the
memory and the vrm and that heatsink on
the right side was actually over here
but the vrm and some of the memory is
the all that stuff's over in this area
so you got I believe that's our memory
chips the gddr5 acts but that's our
memory that's our GPU we've got some
other stuff going on here vrm set up
power header with the pin out over here
connected to the board and that pretty
much wraps up the 1080 that's it so
that's cool so that is it for the GTX
1080 and GP 104 this is not a big Pascal
that's GP 100 but it is the first Pascal
chip for the consumer audience on the
gaming side from the GeForce division of
Nvidia really don't point to this other
than hey this is what it looks like so
that's the the teardown process now
almost none of this last half the
painful half of the process was
necessary to apply the liquid cooler
that we're gonna throw on there to do
that we actually could have stopped when
it was at this stage this is a 980 I you
could stop at this stage and this
doesn't have all the stupid annoying hex
screws on the back but and then you
apply the cold plate the block right
here where you would apply the heatsink
the Alawis heatsink normally so that's
it that's what I got for you check back
for the liquid cooled version with our
overclocking results we're gonna see if
we can sustain a higher clock without
the same thermal throttling issues that
we experienced with the stock cooler for
the 1080 as always links the description
