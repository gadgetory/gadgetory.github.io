stone to talk about command prompt
so we're billing this as things everyone
should know about command prompt
basically useful commands and items that
will get you through troubleshooting or
looking like a hacker on public
television or something like that so
bring us in here what's give us the
first item everyone should know about
command prompt so when you're using
command prompt it's not the absolute
most powerful command-line interface
which I guess says to to me it's it's
usable anybody can learn it if they want
to right it's not like Linux they're not
exactly you know the Linux has its
terminal right and there are
similarities but not exactly the same
and the but the one thing like if
anybody wants to learn about command
prompt the key to all of this the
magical awesomeness is forward slash
question mark almost every command you
want to learn about if you just type in
the command and then a space and then
forward slash question mark it will give
you a help menu on how that command
works right it gives the flags mm-hmm
what they do and generally not a good
idea to just pull commands off the
internet forums and paste them because
you don't know what someone's trying to
do to your computer if it's Linux the
equivalent would be like shamone 777
your entire system which for those who
don't know would basically open up
public read/write access to every
everything oh you don't want a scenario
like that so it slash question mark I'll
answer that stuff Linux equivalent would
be like a man as a man manual vigil yep
and for Windows command prompt what
we're focusing on so the more useful
items would probably be on the
troubleshooting side I've always used
sort of scan OS fix OS mmm fix big jar
rather a fixmbr yep stuff like that yeah
so there's a boot command you type in
boot re see one word mm-hmm rec and then
you can do the slash question mark and
you'll see those commands so fixmbr
fixes the Master Boot Record yeah but
now be careful with that one right there
if you try to go and do bootrec from
your basic command prompt
it's not going to work you got to be in
the
so basically like you got to be booting
from a flash drive with the windows
install discs all right
what does repair mode command prompt
what you're getting that there and I
should say this too if you're in startup
repair and you click on the command
prompt option there you can use bootrec
from there right yeah
but if you're just in like you you go to
your Start menu and windows is working
fine and you do CMD and run as
administrator or whatever and type in
bootrec it's gonna be like what's that
yeah exactly and that's for your own
safety really yes so that's that's one
of the things and Windows nowadays is
generally smart enough which I hesitate
to use that word with Windows but
generally intelligent enough to tell you
something's wrong with the MBR
something's wrong with OS detection and
you can go into that pre boot
environment and there's a lot of it
right around the appropriate command if
you know how to do the command prompt
last question bar and scan OS is an
important one because if you have
multiple OS installs on your drive and
it's not detecting one that you know is
there you can do scan it fix boot racks
and then scan OS and it'll tell you
although Isis they detect yeah when you
do scan LS it's gonna give you a list of
the operating systems that it finds and
then it's like which one would you like
to add back to the boot configuration
database and it's like one two three and
you just choose the number also useful
if your boot up is telling you that
there's multiple os's and you only want
one and then you remove the ones that
you don't want there mmm ideally
uninstall them correctly but what's
another command Ron tell me with neither
one so another really useful one is
check disk
chkdsk and then again force last
question marks you can figure out what
the flags are flags options whatever you
want to call them and the one you're
gonna find yourself using most often is
/r which is a repair now you you can't
do this online meaning you can't be
using your computer and do the repair so
what it will do if you do check this
last hour gotta be running as
administrator by the way which again
type in CMD in the Start menu you'll see
a CMD pop up there right-click choose
run as administrator and then do chkdsk
and then /r and it's going
be like hey we couldn't do this right
now would you like us to schedule this
to do nice time you reboot and then what
it's gonna do is it's gonna scan the
sectors on your hard drive and this is
going to look for bad sectors now if
there's information in there that's
that's valuable and they can recover
that information is going to grab it out
of there and then it's gonna mark that
sector as hey don't use a sector anymore
and this makes a drive that is running
really slow oftentimes improve because
what's happening is the drives trying to
read over and over and over again on
this one bad sector and you're like why
is this read taking forever and the
answer is because the sector is going
bad and then when you run check disk
it's like hey I'm not using that sector
anymore it's like my hard drives back to
normal again
and you can also check the hard drive
health to with smart attributes so you
don't know if there's a problem that you
feel like there might be go look for any
smart SMA RT attribute reader mmm and
then it'll tell you if it thinks sectors
are bad or things like that
yeah use that first pin pin commands are
good excellent one yup so that's a
really simple one you can use it right
now from your desktop please type in P
ing space and then give it a domain name
or IP address yep so if you have like
google.com it's almost always up pinging
Google com that will basically give you
a response time how long it takes a
packet information to get there and back
yep that's right yep and then and then
that'll tell you is the website down is
my system down whatever my network yeah
you're basically checking for network
connectivity it is your computer
connected and right and is it connected
to whatever site or IP address is trying
to get to if you want some fun trivia
look up pain of death it's not really
something you can do anymore but it's
it's kind of cool information sort of
like an early DDoS yeah exactly
exactly basically pinging with really
large packets is another really good
networking one IP config this one is
just an information command that's not
true you can do stuff with it too
meaning that you can release and renew
your IP address right so the the process
of getting an IP address is called DHCP
it's a protocol and
you you've got a DHCP server sitting so
on your network whether you know it or
not most of the time it's your router so
like let's say you got like a Linksys
box or a net gearbox or something that
it's got a software DHCP server running
on it so when your computer joins the
network or when your phone hops on the
network it sends out a request and it's
like hey is there any DHCP server out
there and the DHCP server replies back
with the message and says yes I am
the computer's like kind of have an IP
address than DHCP servers like sure
here's one and so you get this IP
address and if you do IP config release
the address you've been given is then
released from your computer and if you
do an IP config we're new it does that
DHCP for DHCP process again and then you
get another IP address or most of the
time the same IP address back yeah
useful if there's like IP conflict on
your internal network or something like
that absolutely right and then
traceroute that's another networking one
that's useful so I have used this a lot
on the server admin side managing the GN
server where if I call support and say
hey there's a really slow response from
my server they'll have me run a
traceroute and the point of that is to
look at all the different points that
your packet of data hits along the way
to its its destination it goes hops in
the network environments and so all it's
doing is it saying okay when I'm at the
server what's the default gateway for
the server and it shows that hopped that
d-ball gateway and then it goes to the
next one next one next one all the way
until you get to your destination now
some of the time the information is
blocked right by some of those devices
that are in that hop count but a lot of
the time when you're just going across
the public Internet it's just all there
and you can see everything yeah it's
just trace RT and you can do the slash
question mark to get information on that
but one fun thing to look at that a lot
of people maybe don't know is your ISP
Time Warner 80 any other evil empire you
can think of Comcast comes to mind when
I say that the ISP hello when you do a
trace route for different servers you'll
actually see jumping through all these
hops and so you're actually you're not
getting the direct connections on the
server you're going through potentially
a dozen yeah different hops and
right and they might even be owned by
different ISPs or different servers
whatever they all talk to each other
exactly right so kind of an interesting
information there any other networking
stuff before I move on to batch files
well so if you're interested in paying
and you're interested in traceroute
there's kind of an in-between
it's called path pane that is not what I
know that yeah so so put path thing it
kind of does a little bit of both so the
the penguin gives you a little bit more
information about how long things taking
that kind of stuff and the trace routes
a little more like you know here's your
pathway so path thing is kind of like ml
between the two so yeah a little bit of
both worlds very cool and then batch
files are sort of so good yeah they work
with mannheim so we use these a lot for
testing and test automation specifically
so just as an example something that
will often do is run these benchmarks as
you all know for 1080p 1440 4k and we'll
have ultra medium whatever so there's
times like 20 folders we create for
every single video card so we just sit
there and click all the time and then
type and type yes yes I can click 20
times per video card no how do we do so
you can do a batch file which is you
just do a notepad open up notepad and
you can type in in this instance mkdir
make directory mkdir space and then the
name of the file you quotations if it's
gonna be with spaces in there
but you do that and then that'll
actually just when you run the batch
file dot bat you rename it to dot bat
instead of txt on the batch file it'll
create that folder yes so in this
specific example if you want to create
20 folders and even you can get more
advanced and nest them in each other
your kid and you click it once and I
just yeah and it's all there for you so
so in other words rather than you know
programming this or testers are typing
this every time you write the program
once and you create a parent folder for
each different graphics card and then
you've run the program in each parent
folder right and it's and I say program
very loosely it's just like we said a
batch file and in the end a batch file
is mostly just command prompt commands
inside of a text document that gets
renamed
you delete the extension dot txt
you add the extension dat right and in
Windows you'll have to tell it to allow
you to do yeah you have to show
extensions exactly right so you can do
that in the folder options and you go to
options but one of the other useful
things here things like time out time
out when I such a good one yes we've all
is even right pause is very good for
debugging mm-hmm so if you create a
batch file that's supposed to do
something cool and it sort just opens
and closes now one method I used to use
was you try and screenshot it really
fast and see what the error said but it
turns out you can just type in pause
after certain lines and you'll figure
out which one it's it's dying on okay so
that's pause timeout what does time I do
so timeout you do a slash T after that's
the option for timeout and it's really
having options required and syntax and
then after the slash T you put in a
number of seconds right and so what that
does is let's say that you you wanted to
see the output but you didn't needed to
stop the program so you would say all
right do this command then wait five
seconds so I can read the output and
then just keep going everybody saw the
timeout command works right so we use
that and testing again where you have
like a timeout 1:20 so two-minute
timeout and then it'll launch or kill a
program if so it's another good example
if you want to start a program in a
batch file or even just from command
prompts because they're really all the
same yep command you just type in start
space and then the path to the file or
the exe or whatever and it enter it'll
execute so we'll use that for programs
games would ever start DRT dot exe and
start dirt rally there you go and it
launches it and then you can set a
timeout separately and that will you
know to wait whatever amount of time
before executing the next command which
is maybe to kill it yeah so there's
taskkill mm-hmm that's a good one yeah
so task list and task of kinda go ahead
and hand task list like the this one
I've used for again we're talking about
things that anybody can use and that can
be useful if you've ever been infected
with a virus before maybe you lose
control of your GUI but you can open a
command prompt you can use task list and
it shows you basically the same thing
you see in the processes view
of the task manager and the cool thing
is you can add an option to that task
list slash SBC and it even shows you
what's in each service host and so you
can find you know this random thing
that's like one two three four I'm not a
liar Exe right and so you get this thing
and you find the process ID for it or
the image name for it which is just the
name of the file and then you do task
skill and you have to specify /am for
image name and type the XE name or /p a
PID and type in the process ID for it so
these are really good for
troubleshooting or like he was saying
just ending a program right so two good
ones yeah so you have trouble ending a
program can't get the command proper
task manager you could certainly do it
that way there's plenty of other
commands too but batch files are really
one of the most fun for me to work with
I will probably do a full video on that
in the future but with batch files again
just think of any sort of repetitive
tasks or if you want to be playfully
malicious you can even do things like a
shutdown batch file yeah so that's
that's a good one where or a command
prompt that creates infinite command
prompts oh I forgot about that so it's a
good one
yeah you just you start over and over
yeah so that's that's an endless loop of
command prompt yeah and then you put it
little donut father don't do this go to
put up a startup folder and anyone who
died never works again I already doesn't
know how to get the safer it is screwed
so that's the one fun thing to do
shutdown as fun as it is to be malicious
is actually functionally useful as well
yeah so I've done this where for example
if I'm downloading a patch for a game
okay like pick an MMO right yeah you
download a patch forever and you may
want to go to sleep don't want to leave
it drawing power so you can set a down
command from command prompt and give it
a timer yep absolutely yeah you know
it'll be done in four hours you tell it
shut down in four hours
yeah and you can you shut down command
also those restarts - and one of the
cool things is if you had some reason to
restart one of the one of the restart
flags you can do is a restart and reopen
applications that were previously
running
so it's kind of a cool thing yeah yeah
and the other base there is one more
that I think everybody should know so
one of the things if you're going to use
command prompt is you have to understand
file structure
you really do but before you go messing
around with all this stuff please please
please go get like a brief primer and
file structure right when somebody says
the route of a drive yeah you didn't
know what that means or when they say a
folder inside of a folder or when they
use the word directory you know what
these words mean and one of the best
commands for navigating around the
command prompt is CD right thank you
change directory yeah or if you don't
know what your current directory is
because you've changed your prompt with
the prompt command CD will show your
current directory so it has two
functions right and then dir will show
you everything in the directory you're
in and that's a really small tree the
memory tree will look more slightly more
graphical format can do that as well
right but dirt and CD are fantastic yeah
yeah yeah Darry that's that's one that
I've used regularly for going into safe
mode with man prompt so if there's a
virus issue I'll always go safe mode
with command rounds and I'm thinking of
older Windows operating systems here
where you have no interface yeah
right and in that situation it was good
because you're really not loading any
risk elements that could contain the
virus and you might want to navigate to
your avast or a Norton folder or
whatever I guess I guess you would
navigate to the Norton folder to remove
it and never use it again because it's
terrible and when you're there you can
type in dir find the Exe name start it
and that will start your antivirus or
removal or whatever yeah yeah so lots of
really good uses for command prompt if
it's not something you've learned just
go check it out and try some of the
things we've mentioned here lots of cool
automatic guides there for them and you
know it can do a little networking it
can do a little bit of file management
it can do automation for you if you know
how to use that if you're going to use
the batch files so command prompt
totally something that as I guess you
could call yourself a power user right
you
you should know how to do speaking of
there is a PowerShell extension so if
there's something commands command
prompt can't do em hmm there's a
powershell for that yeah so if you are
at all interested in learning about
servers and doing Network administration
you definitely learn PowerShell
PowerShell is basically the backend of
Windows Server you can run Windows
Server with absolutely no GUI and
PowerShell can do everything that you
ever wanted it to do right so there you
have it a previous video that we did
together have you've seen it was all
about batteries that you'd ever not want
to know now you have command prompts but
this stuff is actually really cool and
fun to use and functionally useful and
it's impressive - as I said public
television viewers so as always the
