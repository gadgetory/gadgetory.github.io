net and what you're looking at is the
benchmark results video for our recent
Star Wars Battlefront open beta
benchmark test so we have another video
on the channel already showcasing the
games really quite impressive graphics
at maximum settings with a 4k resolution
using high-end 980 TI that video is
already up if you want to see the
benchmark course we use see the game's
graphics capabilities and listen to me
talk about our test methodology and very
brief form then go check out that video
for this one this accompanies the
article linked in the description below
which explores the performance of the
video cards at various resolutions from
4k 214 42 1080 and we also look at ultra
high and medium graphic settings and how
they impact the various devices on bench
do note that some of our AMD devices are
now getting a bit aged to like the 290x
and 285 they are technically last
generation but we do have a 390 X on
hand and we're able to test that with
these benches for an explanation of the
games settings check the article links
in the description below I talk about
what each of them does what it means but
here's a few screenshots of the game
settings as they stand in the open beta
and as for performance let's just start
looking at that right now so first of
all here's the 4k chart as always big
disclaimer this game is in beta that
means that there will be maps there will
be assets vehicles game modes to which
we are not presently exposed so FPS
could change when the full game comes
out and those items are launched
alongside it they could be more
intensive they could be less intensive
we'll just have to revisit it once the
games out back to the charts 4k you can
see that basically sli 980 is are
required to get 60 FPS so if you want 60
FPS which for a fast paced shooter like
battlefront you probably do want as
close to that as possible if not more
then it is going to require some kind of
multi-gpu set up either crossfire or sli
even the high-end seahawk 980 TI which
is a liquid-cooled card with
a boost of 1291 megahertz stock we're
still sitting dead at 44 FPS it
certainly wasn't a bad experience but as
the game sort of hits the dips where
explosions and things like that occur
you do see that card struggle to a point
where I would probably want to drop down
to 1440 if I were gaming with it and
here are those 1440 charts so again the
sli 980 TI combo quite obviously at the
top and for good reason it's two video
cards that's at about 120 FPS average
but has pretty bad lows at 66 FPS for
one percent and 55 FPS for 0.1 percent
now in comparison to the other cards
these don't look that bad but when you
compare against the average which is
what you want to do there's a large 2x
disparity between the average with sli
and the lows whereas the other cards
have pretty tight timings and that
disparity we've seen it before it's just
it happens with multi-gpu setups and the
gap being that large means that the dips
and frames will be more noticeable as a
player so although the one percent in
0.1 percent those are still effectively
60 FPS which is what we want the size of
the dip from 117 to those numbers is
noticeable one plane so you get a bit of
stuttering or tearing or some other
perceived and negative impact resultant
of this the single GTX 980 TI the MSI
Seahawk pushes 83 FPS average and that's
definitely playable and it retains it
really tight timings for one percent and
0.1 percent blows another plus for the
card the r9 390 ex again performs pretty
impressively well with battlefront and
that's because this game as we learn
throughout the process of this benchmark
seems to be fairly optimized so the 390
X gets about 70 FPS at 1440 ultra and at
four hundred dollars that's a very
competitive by for battlefront matched
up against something like the GTX 970
currently three hundred twenty dollars
and
that would be about your cutoff the 970
can just barely handle 1440 at Ultra you
would probably realistically be dropping
a few of the settings down too high just
to make sure you're retaining a high
baseline during the dips when gameplay
gets intense and obviously again this
cutoff point is a little bit dangerous
if you're buying a card right now
because we haven't seen the rest of the
game yet so we don't know how that will
change going forward but I will
certainly update this guide with a new
video once once we're at that point 1080
the one that most people probably want
to see here shows the most populated
chart and it ranges all the way down to
the GTX 770 r9 285 and gtx 960 in terms
of playable cards the r9 270x a former
mainstay which has been replaced by the
r7 370 in effect it's not a perfect
replacement but it's about that and the
GTX 950 both of those cards are all
three of those if you include the r7 370
struggle to retain ultra at 1080p the
gtx 960 4 gigabyte card did not yield
noteworthy gains over the 2 gigabyte
alternative when we tested on this map
this resolution these settings we have
seen games were 4 gigabytes impacts
performance and have a complete video on
that just search the channel 4 4
gigabytes vs. 2 gigabytes and you'll
find that but for this game didn't
really see an impact I did look at vram
consumption it wasn't scientific it
wasn't complete we are doing both of
those things for vram consumption
analysis very soon but for a brief top
level sort of thrown together analysis
we saw about 4 gigabytes of vram
consumed at 4k and ultra so the game is
capable of eating quite a lot of video
ram with 2 gigabytes of system rankin
soon and this was after only a 10-minute
test run on a low population
single-player map so these numbers will
or should at least inflate as you play
more complex scenes and that's something
that we're testing in the
the immediate future so for the 1080
benchmarks you can play on pretty much
anything you need to drop down to high
for the gtx 950 the r9 270x or similar
cards and need to drop down to medium
for the gtx 750ti or similar cards to 65
things like that would be best on medium
so that is the benchmark for star wars
battlefront as we conducted it tonight
check out the article linked in the
description below for the full details
for the cards that we think are the best
graphics cards to buy for battlefront as
it stands today in this benchmark and
let me know if you have questions if you
like this content if this helps you if
it interests you please check out our
patreon page linked in the postural
video and any support we get there has
been a huge help in ensuring that we're
able to remain independent and our
endeavors to do all this testing and
stay up literally all hours of the night
to put together a fun guide with a fun
game so check all that out I will see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
