a bit different and looking at a test
bench this is what we use for testing
all of the games when we do game
benchmark tests and FPS tests so this is
sort of inside the operation it's not
necessarily something you can use as a
consumer but it's still cool to know how
things work and what goes on behind the
scenes at our media outlet and add a lot
of other ones this is what's known as an
HP TX top deck tech station which is
very difficult to say and it's a two
layer test bench and it's called a top
deck tech station because the top layer
is the one that houses the components
the motherboard and three fans over here
3 120 million fans off the screen that
are used optionally to keep things cool
if we're doing anything hi overclocking
or extremely intensive that requires
additional cooling the bottom layer or
the bottom deck as it's called is used
for the power supply which is loose I
don't mount this with screws or anything
and then we've got SSDs and if you have
them hard drives and that SSDs and hard
drives mount on the underside of the top
deck in acrylic rails and everything on
this bench is non-conductive it's
completely ESD safe so there's really
very minimal risk of anything getting
damaged from electrostatic discharge
unless it's coming from a human who did
not properly ground themselves because
the components and the the build of the
tech station are all acrylics and
plastics and nylon and this foam is an
anti ESD foam so everything is very
clean in terms of static electricity
which is important because this is open
air it's got nothing to protect it from
from ESD so in terms of the build here
this does not ship built I had to do it
myself and it takes a bit of time you
start with the two decks and then you
move to the motherboard standoffs which
are really just rubber non-conductive
feet for the motherboard to sit atop and
there are two nylon threaded screws that
come through the board and then if you
want to keep it in place you can screw
down a washer to hold that board in
place which is also I believe in nylon
the rails are acrylic we mount four of
those in total to how is all of the SSDs
that we need they do not mount with
screw
use their sort of loosely sitting in the
rail system we just lay the power supply
loosely on the bottom atop an anti ESD
mat and there is a bracket to mount this
more permanently if we wanted to but I
move things around a lot and this makes
our lives a lot easier so that's really
why we have this thing and it's not good
at representing a real-world cooling
scenario if you're doing cpu cooler test
or something like that so we don't test
CPU coolers on this we strictly test
GPUs for the FPS output because cooling
is really not going to affect that too
much since we're going to keep it very
cool whether or not it's in an enclosed
case so all that matters here is that we
have very easy access to the video cards
you can see it supports up to 4-way SLI
as long as the motherboard does and we
can easily unscrew these nylon screws
they're obviously too / / card or 1 /
expansion slot and then we take the card
out drop the next one in and this is
done for something like 10 video card
configurations so this can save up to a
couple minutes per card because it's
eliminating the requirement of opening
up a case getting down on the floor and
pulling the card out in the dark and all
that crap that you all know and have
dealt with when it's in it in a desk
environment so this makes our lives very
easy takes about 30 seconds to swap a
card and then we can continue on with
our testing and and keep things very
controlled in a completely open air
environment with enterprise-class fans
that will not have bearing degradation
anytime soon so we know we can trust
these two cool all the cards pretty
equally when we are doing cooling tests
in the open air environment but most
importantly it's all very modular so if
I want to pull this board off and put a
different test platform on here all I
have to do is unscrew the two washers
pull it up move it drop the new one on
top of it and that's it done there's no
system building required you can swap
components in their entirety and less
than five minutes so this is really
making our lives a lot easier we can

media opportunities and leave a comment
if you have questions and I will see you
all next time
yes
