hardcore overclocking and today we're
gonna be taking a look at a gtx 1070 TI
PCV this is colorful volc√°n x edition
and well has quite the PCB and you know
it is also a lot taller than normal
before that this video is brought to you
by thermal grizzly makers of the
conductor not liquid metal that we
recently used to drop 20 degrees off of
our coffee leak temperatures thermal
grizzly also makes traditional thermal
compounds we use on top of the IHS like
cryo not and hydro not pastes learn more
at the link below so let's get right
into it as there's no really much else
to say about the card you have a minor
supporting voltage well you have the
pecks of erm down here which is normal
for basically all Nvidia cards this vrm
exists and this runs on one this outputs
one volt and it powers the PCIe
interface as well as some internal PLL's
of the GPU core very important to keep
the card working completely useless for
overclocking until you're well below
zero so only really worth worrying about
if you're on a liquid nitrogen and even
then it's really not a high power output
vrm so it's you know you're never gonna
see anybody do bother with doing a
two-phase design of that it's always
just a fully integrated buck converter
like we have here up here we have what I
suspect is the 1.8 volts rail which and
video cards require for some internal
PLL's on the GPU core as well as their
bio system on cards with gddr5 X this
would also be used for power for the VPP
line of the gddr5 X chips but on a GT
the gtx 1070 TI uses gddr5 so basically
this is here just for the bio system and
the GPU core now then we're gonna move
into the actually interesting VRMs even
if they do just as much as the other two
in terms of what we're clocking on air
cooling and water cooling this right
here is the V curve erm so that provides
the bulk of the power that your GPU uses
and behind that we find the memory v RM
right here so that power is the gddr5
memory chips located around the GPU core
so the V curve erm is a one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve phase the RM design and so
naturally it is using a doubling scheme
the doublers are located on the back of
the card and they are not just doublers
it's actually dual drivers with the
phase extension functionality so
basically you have one chip controlling
uh basically turning the MOSFETs in this
VR I'm on and off well you have four
MOSFETs hook it up to one drug driver IC
which drives the four MOSFETs well
drives two MOSFETs at a time so if
fective lee it looks like a twelve phase
this is the only real way to do a four
twelve phase vrm design I'm not gonna go
into the details of how exactly it works
but yes this this is the right way to do
a twelve phase there's a way to make
something that looks like this and isn't
actually running out of like isn't
running in twelve phase mode but this is
the proper way to do it the chips for
that are located on the back those are
fed the PWM signal from this chip which
that is the completely typical for
NVIDIA cards you p95 eleven voltage
controller this is an eight phase-- chip
so here it's being only used in six
phase mode so they're not using two of
the phases available on the U P 95 11
and that's because you can't like if
you're using a doubling scheme you have
to double all of your phases you can't
double like four and then use for more
natively from the chip that doesn't work
so that's why you know this is being and
in six phase mode here and the u p95 of
eleven supports switching frequencies up
to 600 kilohertz which considering that
and I ran out of space there up to 600
kilohertz and basically that's how
quickly it turns the MOSFETs
on and off in the vrm now since this is
using a doubling scheme this 600
kilohertz would actually go to the
driver chips on the back of the card
600 kilohertz and once it comes out of
the driver chip to the phase like the
these MOSFETs up here would be switching
at 300 kilohertz and the MOSFETs down
here would be switching also at 300
kilohertz because basically the way the
doubling schemes all work is that they
take the 600 kid they take the input pwm
signal and just split it in half so
every other pulse goes every other pulse
goes to the other V our other phase so
that's basically how this works now then
let's talk about the actual MOSFETs use
these are dual N fats from Alpha and
Omega semiconductor these are AoE 69 30s
these would have you would have colorful
really likes using them I've seen these
on a gtx 980ti from colorful but the
first time you would have probably seen
these is all in the GTX Titan XP as
Nvidia uses it that these for their
reference card these are actually really
nice MOSFETs very low RDS on on the low
side fat at zero point
Wow no weight 1.05 milliohms RDS on for
the low side fat at 5 volt
gate-to-source and i'm using 5 volt
gate-to-source because i have no idea
what drive voltage colorful is actually
using on this card I assume it's 5 volts
because they do have this V arm here
which the u p95 11 and a bunch of logic
on this card actually requires a 5 volt
rail so it just makes sense to reuse it
for driving as well and then the high
side MOSFET built into the a OE 69 30 is
7 million RDS on at that same 5 volt
gate to source voltage luckily we're
like this is pretty high but the high
side MOSFET is all about being able to
turn on and off quickly and not all
about its RDS on and in that department
this thing can turn on at speeds of as
high as 4 nanoseconds turn on in 3
nanoseconds turn off so this is like
this is really fast you find a lot of
high-end MOSFETs out there that are sort
of in the 10 nanosecond range for both
of these
and then when you start looking at the
really cheap MOSFETs that are also
available you start looking at 20 to 30
nanoseconds switching speeds so well
turn falling times and rising times and
well those are basically atrocious but
these are really really fast definitely
in line with some of the top MOSFETs
that you can find out there so the end
result is that with this you know with
this high-end mosfet and the ridiculous
phase account this vrm is absolutely
insane overkill for a gtx 1070 TI so
under normal operating conditions you'd
be looking at this vr i'm pushing to the
core about zero 1.09 volts which that's
the maximum voltage you can set through
something like afterburner
and you're gonna be looking at currents
between 150 and 200 amps for these kinds
of current levels at 300 kilohertz
switching for frequency because you know
I'm doubling scheme and 5 volt gate to
source voltage for 158 you're looking at
about 8 watts of heat output for 200
amps and it's looking at around 13 watts
of heat output so this is really really
an efficient massive overkill on power
colors I mean colourful messing up the
name is Hieu sorry about that it's
colorful not power color less colorful
names would be good but uh yeah very
very efficient we are I'm a ridiculous
power capability very overkill I really
think you know some people would
probably prefer it if this wasn't as
tall and the vrm was a few faces less
but as far as the arm designs ago
there's nothing to complain about here
if for some reason you decided that you
really want to run this gtx 1070 TI on
liquid nitrogen which to be completely
fair since no gtx 1070 TI is actually
specifically designed for liquid
nitrogen you might as well run across a
run whatever you come across so if you
decided to run this one you'd be pushing
probably voltages around 1.3 5 volts
some cars will be slightly lower some
currents will be slightly higher and
about 250 amps
and also basically the reason why you
don't go higher on the core voltage for
liquid nitrogen is because jp104 really
doesn't work well at high voltage it
basically doesn't scale and I've seen
like I've already overclocked at 1017
liquid nitrogen and everybody who's
worked with 10 80s and 10 70s before can
confirm this
basically the jp104 chip really doesn't
like high voltages even at very low
negative temperatures so you end up
getting stuck around that sort of
voltage range and current draw which
means that the VR I'm even under liquid
nitrogen which would be a kind of
extreme usage scenario ends up only
producing about 19 watts of heat so
again you know the it's ridiculous
overkill like this vrm wouldn't look out
of place on a gtx 980ti but here it is
on a 1070 TI so props too colorful for
splurging on components here now then
the memory of erm is a two-phase design
this is better than what you would find
on most cards in sort of well just in
general a lot of cards come with
single-phase memory power and two phases
can help with memory overclocking a tiny
amount not anything huge but it can help
so that's nice to see and the MOSFETs
used are again the same Alpha and Omega
69 30s for gddr5 you're gonna be looking
at an output voltage of around 1.5 volts
maybe 1.5 5 volts on some cards so it
depends but I'm doing the rating at 1.5
volts
the controller is au p90 now not 90 1658
it integrates both while the driver
circuits for both phases so there's no
actual like basically there's no other
driver chips anywhere around this VRM
and this chip supports two phases up to
300 kilohertz switching frequency and I
ran out of space again I you you'd think
I'd learn after the first time wouldn't
you evidently naw so 300 kilohertz 1.5
volts again using that 5 volt gate to
source voltage because they're going to
use the same drive voltage everywhere
you'd be looking at maybe 25 amps of
current output on two-phase memory on
the gddr5 because we do only have eight
memory chips here and at that current
output level you're only looking at
about 1.5 watts of heat output so again
great job colorful with the vrm here and
you know it's a good thing that these
VRMs are both so ridiculously efficient
because well the heatsink is kind of
just a bit like the vrm eat sink where
this card is just basically a sheet of
aluminum and that like I mean I guess it
has more surface area than the MOSFETs
but that's not really you know that
doesn't that's not exactly
confidence-inspiring in the vrm cooling
department but with the heat output
levels that these the arms are putting
out like the heat output on these VRMs
is so low that I think colorful can get
away with the anemic looking base plate
the rme cooler so that covers the vrm
portion of the card one cool feature
that colorful decided to add on to the
card is you actually get voltage read
points off here so you can check your n
VDD so that's your core voltage FB VDD
which I am not sure what that that's
gonna be the memory so that's gonna be
the memory one there I'm not used to you
know and I don't want overclock and
video cards that much so I'm not used to
the terminology used here so that's
gonna be V core pecks VDD that's the v
RM I pointed out down here 1.8 volts is
the one I pointed out over here and you
also get a ground tab so that's really
nice they don't have a measurement point
for the this VR I'm down here which I
assume is 5 volts which is kind of
interesting but this is not the first
card to like include all the other
voltages and not bother with the drive
voltage and this can be handy if you
know your Experian you aren't able to
RMA the card and are having issues with
it running these voltage read points are
really convenient because you basically
don't have to like figure out how to
stab the right capacitor for this one if
you if you think that there's an issue
with this rail or that
or any other rail on the card so you
know it's a nice feature to have for
overclockers though I think for most
daily users this is completely pointless
still a nice addition and it doesn't
really cost anything to do as it is just
a PCB you know small PCB design tweak
now then if you want to really let the
card fly basically take and videos power
limitations off of it the shunt
resistors for doing that are located
down here and I wrote over one of them
so you have three shunt resistors
because you have three power inputs you
have two eight pins and you have the
PCIe as well and so each of these shunt
resistors monitors the current going
from one of those sources I am not sure
which one is for which source if you're
planning to short these out the best way
to do that is generally to apply a thin
layer of liquid metal across them
because if you try to short them out by
like soldiering over them or something
you run the risk of shorting them out
too much and if the GPU detects that the
power the power reading provided by the
shunt resistors is too low it will put
the card in safety mode and basically
the card is a safety mode on a gtx gtx
10 series card is basically the card is
stuck at 139 139 megahertz core clock
which is you know which basically makes
the card completely useless
so you know thin layer of liquid metal
is your best bet for getting a ez power
mod if you want to do something more
advanced the ia32 to wanna is up here
I've done a advanced power mod guide for
like completely remove all power
limitations on these cards guide on my
own channel so actually our core
overclocking but for most users it you
know if your although if you're at the
point that you're modifying but you
don't have a soul during iron really
just thin layer of liquid metal and you
don't want to go heavy on the liquid
metal because liquid metal does eat
solder so if you apply too much of it
you're you are running the risk of the
shunts basically that well the solder
dissolving and the shunts falling off so
you know be careful when modifying the
cards because you you can basically end
up killing the card
and well RMA is not gonna be okay with
it when you send them a card missing
components so that's it for this video
