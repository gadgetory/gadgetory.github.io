going to be taking a look at an RX 460
sapphire nitro PCB so this is one of the
custom Rx for 60s that you can go and
buy you know buy right now if you're
interested in the performance fps and
thermals of this card there is a review
down in the description below the video
so you can just click on that if you
want to know performance metrics and
that kind of thing because in this video
we will only be covering PCB components
PCB quality and you know that kind of
thing so with that out of the way let's
get to it
first things first the main VRMs on the
RX 460 nitro our core voltage which is
right here
memory voltage which is located right
above the core voltage v RM and the
auxiliary rail which is located down
here now we will not be going into too
many details about the auxiliary rail
because it's not really important it's
not a high power v RM there's no real
good reason to push a ton of voltage
through it but we will cover core
voltage and memory voltage and all of
those the other vrm that I should know
that I'm not covering on this card is
the point 9 5 volt rail because
apparently it's so low power that it
doesn't actually need a full load out of
the RM components and so I haven't
managed to find it since I'm only given
pictures and it's really hard to find
either way you do not have to worry
about the point 9 5 volt rail because
there's never almost never a reason to
actually care about that v RM like
really even it even when doing like ln2
overclocking you don't have to worry
about it
generally speaking so it doesn't matter
that I'm not covering it so then let's
look at the most possibly well arguably
the most important we are I'm located on
the card so that's the core voltage v RM
right here so this provides the bulk of
the power for your GPU over there and so
for phase v RM that you
is sapphires black diamond chokes if I'm
not mistaken is the name for them
there's slightly different design to
improve thermals with the you know the
ridges on the top and all that to
increase surface area there's four of
these so that tells us this is a four
phase design because we also have of
course for power stages so our stages
are basically all in one VRM components
they combine all of your usual vrm
components into one large IC like you
can see here these things are from
vishay these RS IC 780 s they are they
are capable of as much as 50 amps and
you really shouldn't actually run them
at that because the datasheet says they
can do 50 but if you actually look at
the data sheets specification graphs
they lose a lot of their efficiency by
around 35 amps current throughput so
that puts this vrm at around 150 amps
maximum current if you don't want to
completely throw the efficiency out the
window and 150 amps is actually
completely overkill for a card like the
rx 460 because this is a 75 watt TDP by
AMD's like for AMD's recommended spec
the Nitro is an overclocked card so it
obviously draws a little bit more than
that
however nonetheless a hundred 50 amps is
way too much for a card that pulls
around 80 to 90 watts even if you
overclock it you're gonna be you know
maybe in the hundred a hundred something
watt range and this can do 150 amps okay
this can do courage that's not what so
what you could probably push around 200
Watts through this VRM or more depending
on how much voltage you actually ask ask
it to output speaking a voltage you
really don't have to be worried about
damaging the vrm on this card because
the voltage levels you need to actually
achieve those levels of currents so
around 150 amps on an Rx 460 you'd be
looking into the well over one point
four volts range
and that's just you know not useful for
any day-to-day things because for
day-to-day usage it's uncool about and
even on liquid nitrogen most of the new
14 nanometer Global Foundries GPUs do
not scale above one point four five ish
Walt's so yeah completely completely
overkill
however this vrm does have its own it
does have its benefits this approached
the design with the ridiculously
overkill components means that the RM
does deliver much higher efficiency when
it's not working and it's you know peak
capabilities and it overall gives you
better thermals and those kinds of
benefits so that's all very well for the
core voltage right there one thing to
know is like you may be thinking this
vrm is like you know I just said this
vrm is completely overkill so you might
be wondering how much does this actually
cost because the RX 416 nitro is one of
the most expensive Rx for 60s you can
buy and this is a budget card well it's
supposed to be a budget card this vrm
actually like these power stages you can
get them for a dollar if you're buying
bulk so there's four of them that's like
four dollars worth of actual like
expensive components chokes capacitors
especially these kinds of capacitors are
relatively like it those are all cheaper
than those uh you know power stages so
basically that whole vrm might cost
around eight dollars maybe something
around there and this whole card costs a
lot more than any other rx 460 so the
PCB does not really justify the price
point that a sapphire has placed this
card at now then moving on from the core
voltage up here alright we have the
memory VRM this is made up of two
individual like separate MOSFETs not a
full power stage so we have a high side
MDU fifteen fourteen this is from magna
chip so this
is a magnet chip MOSFET it's rated for
give me a second
yeah so it's rated for 66 amps at 25
degrees case temperature so that would
be the component is running at 25
degrees sapphire opted to not put a
heatsink on the memory vrm now this
might be kind of concerning at first but
bear with me here
assuming a you know ambient air
temperature of 25 degrees and no air
flow these things can handle 22 amps and
this is a memory vrm so mostly it's
relatively high voltage application so
you know 22 amps 1.5 volts that's 30
watts for memory you're not really going
to be seeing that much power draw
through it also it's the high side phase
that's the high side MOSFET so it
doesn't spend all of its time actually
being conductive so it can actually get
probably handled more current than the
like the continuous rating is like the
worst case scenario so it can certainly
handle more current than you know 22
amps through the hole via through the
hole actual vrm so the low side MOSFET
is an MD you 1517 this can handle up to
30 amps in the same stagnant air 25
degrees conditions as the MD you 15-14
this actually spends most of its time
conducting current because it's the low
side MOSFET that's what it does and
again it's completely overrated at 30
amps and that gives you about 45 watts
total current K you know 45 watts of
power capability for that vrm and that's
assuming some really bad temperatures
because the air flow from the heat sink
of the sapphire natural actually goes
over that vrm so the case temperature
for those components will probably be
quite a lot lower than what the 25
degree ambient temperature rating
assumes because that rating actually
assumes a case temperature of 125
degrees these really shouldn't be
hitting that unless you have very very
high internal case thermals so if your
case is really warm yeah
get there but even at 125 degrees you
don't really have to worry because
there's way too much you know they're
significantly overpowered compared to
what they have to do so finally down
here we have the auxiliary vrm now the
exam I nerve erm I can't actually get
the component numbers for it it doesn't
really matter because this is one of
those VRMs where like with the nine
point nine five volt vrm you literally
don't have to care about what it does
this one is one of those where you don't
really want to push it very far because
the auxiliary rail is the power supply
for the memory system in AMD graphics
cards and that thing is a lot more
fragile than the majority of the core
logic so too much voltage on this VR and
will kill the chip and the vrm as it is
designed will perfectly hand will handle
you know it'll perfectly well handle the
amount of voltage that you can set it to
through the Whatman software and I do
believe you get a voltage control for
this VR M so that covers our V RMS here
for the controller AMD is using the on
semiconductor NCP 8 1 o 22 this thing is
relatively easy to volt mod but for
certain reasons we are not going to
cover that in this video either way it
is a true you know it's a four plus one
phase a voltage controller in this card
it controls the auxiliary so basically
it sends a PWM signal over there and it
also controls the core voltage so down
here so it controls those two voltages
this thing is a capable of being
controlled via software we've seen that
before with other cards using this
voltage controller it's a well-known
controller it's been used over and over
and over and over again so yeah software
voltage control should be coming for it
very very soon if we don't already have
plenty of voltage control available wot
man apparently allows up to one point
one five volts it shouldn't be too long
before afterburner allows something like
1.4 1.3 volts
so again you know voltage control or
nothing to complain about it it's
running a four-phase vrm it can produce
four phases of pwm signals and it can
also power the auxiliary rail on the
back of the card we find the voltage
controller for the memory and that's
over here and this is one of those this
is a fixed state voltage controller you
can't control it via software it's dumb
as a brake it doesn't really do like it
doesn't have I do believe it doesn't
even have any kind of major protection
capabilities though I guess it should
have at least over current it has an
integrated driver circuit in it so you
don't actually see a driver IC for the
memory vrm you only got your high side
and your low side fat so that that's not
included because this voltage controller
right here takes care of that this is a
fixed frequency can't be controlled by
software it is very easy to model but
for the same reasons as before we don't
have quite enough information to explain
the mod in detail for this controller so
we'll just leave it out and that really
covers everything there is to know about
the rx 460 nitro from sapphire the PCB
is very you know I mean now you could
say it's very high quality certainly
well above the minimum requirement for
mate powering and overclocking in rx 460
you have no worries basically with this
ear PCB as it is about you know damaging
the vrm with too much voltage or too
much power or to hike or frequency
really there's nothing to be worried
about with this PCB because it's just
very over built and very overage
engineered on the other hand it is also
extremely expensive and as I mentioned
before that vrm does not really justify
the price point because it isn't like
it's well like it's still using
relatively cheap component rate the
other thing to note is that sapphire
actually left out a lot of things on
this PCB here like here we have a mass
for a second vials chip that's not on
here we can see that there was supposed
to be a button to control RGB or maybe
bio Caesar you know something something
of that type that got left out as well
so this got down costed pretty
significantly just from what you can see
on the PCB that's missing and the price
point does not reflect that but it is a
very very very high quality PCB
nonetheless I just think the card should
be a little bit cheaper so yeah thank
