updates for you first off the AMD 16 dot
7 dot three drivers that we reported on
a couple days ago our soon to be
resolved so I talked about a few issues
in those drivers one being flickering or
crashing another being the colored
screen output that was kind of weird and
just make the whole screen one color so
those are some issues that were resolved
on 1681 at least the RX 470 didn't
exhibit those issues so that looks good
but the 1673 main issue that we talked
about was a limitation of the memory
clock so instead of the original 20 to
50 megahertz maximum clock rate actual
clock rate of the RX 41 overclocking I
card we were suddenly with 1673 limited
to 20 50 megahertz so it went from a to
50 megahertz offset potential to a 50
megahertz offset potential and as stated
in that original video the real world
impact gaming is effectively
non-existent for the most part so it's
not like it was some great tragedy to
lose this performance Headroom but of
course it does eat into overclocking in
a way that feels like it shouldn't since
it originally shipped the RX 480 that is
with a 2 50 megahertz maximum offset on
the clock so we spoke to Andy about that
I talked to Scott Watson former tech
report works at AMD now if you recognize
that name that's why and he gave us one
line that I could publish and that one
line is okay got an update and it's good
news the fix is coming in our next hot
fix driver which is coming very shortly
and when he says the fix he's referring
to the memory offset hopefully
theoretically anyway being reset back to
its maximum potential or at least
somewhere higher than what it is right
now so that's what we've got for you on
that front the 50 megahertz thing I
don't know if it was a mistake or if
what was going on but that should be
resolved in the next driver update and
the next driver update will come out
soon the next news item also very brief
is about these next actually sort of
three items are all related first of all
you may have received an email
newegg or seen posts online about an
alleged AMD r9 involvement in the class
action lawsuit involving nvidia and the
gtx 970 which we'll talk about a moment
if you received that email it was an
error so i even held a md about this
that forwarded them that newegg letter
we got and basically said what's the
wire are you included in this and and
they replied and said and these aware of
reports that newegg has sent emails to
some of its customers about a class
action settlement with AMD regarding the
RNA and graphics card there is no such
lawsuit or settlement which is correct
that's all public knowledge so that's
definitely correct it looks actually to
further emphasize that point new I sent
us another letter later and said you
recently received an email from us
regarding a class action lawsuit related
to md based product that you purchased
this email was sent in error as andy is
not involved in such a lawsuit we
apologize for any misunderstanding in
short oops so that's that settled there
no pun intended there is no r9
settlements you're not going to get free
money if you bought an r 9 so that was
just a mistake the next related item the
GTX 970 class-action kind of talked
about last week a little bit is still in
its settled but it's in flux in terms of
getting your money depending on your
retailer and things like that but right
now today you can definitely get a
partial refund from amazon at a minimum
and newegg looks like they're supporting
that as well or will be soon if you're
out of the loop what's going on here the
GTX 970 last year in February of 2015
there was a class action filed against
it for two reasons while a couple
reasons but two main reasons that's
stuck one was what you may know as the
3.5 gigabyte vram thin it's it's not
really 3.5 it's it's 4 gigabytes of vram
but from memory here 3.5 operates at
something like 192 gigabytes per second
and the extra 512 m
bites the point 5 operates at something
like twenty eight gigabytes per second
let's remember but I think that's
accurate so it was significantly slower
and that's just because the way the
Maxwell architecture allowed and video
to sort of partition its its l2 cache
and other blocks as there's a bunch of
couple blocks and the if you look at the
block diagram you'll see it but they
could partition those out and run slower
or shared memory in some ways that
impact of the performance so the next
item was the Rob's reduction I was a
bigger one so the initial spec sheet
sent to press outlets and at this time
we we I don't think we're receiving
those emails so we were not involved in
that but the initial sheet sent two
outlets before embargo lifts of the 970
listed a higher rops value than what was
finally and ultimately published and
created in the video card itself so that
higher Rob's value obviously not in the
card so anybody was pained for a false
advertising suit and they settled that
they maintain that they've done over on
doing but settlement just means they're
giving money away to make it go away
which doesn't mean yes we did Ron or
what I or any any real definitive
statement just in terms of legal speak
it's just it's making the law so you go
away it's settling it obviously so
that's that's pretty standard practice
in terms of making those issues come to
a close if you bought a 970 I think the
amount is thirty dollars that you are
eligible to claim that's what we're
seeing in the most reports that we've I
say think because I've seen reports of
folks getting up to one hundred percent
refunds from places like Amazon if you
like your card and you're using it and
you want to get one hundred percent
refund that's on you to do but sort of
more within reason the thirty dollar you
can get from Amazon I think newegg is
supporting it now or will be very soon
and all you need to do is contact them
about that I'll help you out all you
need is proof that you bought it so
that's it for this very quick news
update on the video card front RX 460
review coming soon some fam stuff cool
tear down stuff
but that's it so subscribe for more page
online social video I'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
