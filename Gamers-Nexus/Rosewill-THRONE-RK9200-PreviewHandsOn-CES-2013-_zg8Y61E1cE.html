you for taking and visiting us at the
roseville suite here at the Mirage at
CES 2013 what I have next me as our new
focus products full tower case of the
year this is the rosewill throne real
common white and black the white will
have blue LEDs while the black will have
red LEDs push to open cover here and
here you'll find a push button to turn
on and off LEDs of the front fans we
have a reset button at the very top
underneath this angle right here and
you'll have the car binding on the very
top and we'll have two sliders that will
support up to four fans choose raleys
this beat-up defense you'll have for use
be to point out to use be three point
out and we also introduced a hard drive
dock that also support three and a half
into not in charge this is very similar
top stems of the top panel it's
something we borrowed from the floor v2
which is one of our very popular full
time encounter cases right now there are
other we're going to close that is so
you can prevent your desperate coming
back in but i prefer the top tunes up
myself it doesn't like that aggressively
so I'm going to leave that pier in this
video and this door here by default that
will open up from the left to right but
you can remove it Twista positions so
you have an open from right to left just
a really neat feature support up to 10
hard drive tracer install I two and a
half or three and half inch no
additional purchase is necessary rosa
park up to 10 psi ad on cards and will
come with 2 11 40 millimeter dams to 140
on the top 11 40 on the rear and you
have the option since the two additional
140 in front of the hard drive cage and
11 40 on the bottom it will have a side
movable dust filter on the bottom which
covered
of the face of the fam about the case
it's easily washable as well slide back
in and this is our roto from case but
this is our map our only popular product
too sure but we're introduced appear at
CES 2013 we also have our world first
virtual LED RK 9200 feels mechanical
keyboard and with this keyboard you can
control these just whud and the four
directional keys backlight independently
so right now have a red LSD and forth
red barrels I'm going to switch that
over to both green so you have all green
whale or you simply turn both off you
have an up to 4 24 combinations you can
choose from it will have five brightness
modes so right now I have it at lowest
brightness here I'm going to switch it
over to medium high as brightness
setting and you'll have the breathing
boat where it will fade in from lowest
to highest now we consistently turn off
LED lights all together and you can also
lock the windows key so just not
interrupt your gaming session go ahead
and press the function key and then what
else it will flash red three times but
to note it has been engaged to lock it
back on go flash green three times let
you know that it's back on again there's
part up to 12 and key rollovers and each
Key has two LEDs under each key we've
removed one key ahead of time and this
one here you can see is the blue cherry
MX switches it will come in brown black
and red as well so I'm going to turn
this back on so you can see the LED
light back on that's
investigators turn that back of yours
