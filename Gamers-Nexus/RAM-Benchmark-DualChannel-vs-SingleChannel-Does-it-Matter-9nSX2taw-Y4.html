Nexus dotnet and today we're
benchmarking single Channel versus dual
channel configurations for memory on
compatible platforms I wrote a very
detailed 5,000 word article to accompany
this test that includes a full detail
breakdown of how these benchmarks work
and how they apply to your uses in the
real world but the video will focus more
on Adobe After Effects performance and
sort of skim over the other results what
we're testing here today is the
statement that you need to buy ram in
pairs of two else you're significantly
hampering the system that is what we're
testing that's sort of the myth I into
it for a very long time and I was
personally invested in learning the
results there are a couple tests out
there but I wasn't satisfied with them
my hypothesis going into this is that
I'd have a significant impact on video
editing but would be negligible
elsewhere so we'll see if that was
correct
going forward the back story here is
that we met with msi at their HQ in 2013
in july during our california tour and
and this is also by the way where we
show how ram was made so hit that link
if you are interested they showed us
some new laptops that all shipped with a
single stick of 8 gigabytes of RAM and
at the time I pressed and asked why they
would opt for that because to me why
would you sacrifice dual channel
performance that was kind of my thinking
so why not go with 2 x 4 gigabytes for
instance they said that they first
thought was a little cheaper and they
found no noticeable difference between
dual and single channel configurations
when testing internally so I I returned
home I did some lightweight testing and
got results that appeared in line with
this but it wasn't at all comprehensive
I wasn't happy with leaving it there so
we're returning now before diving in I
want everyone to make note that there is
no such thing as quote dual channel RAM
or dual channel memory or a single
channel Ram or single channel memory
before you call me an idiot in the
comments which happens quite frequently
without any research I'm not bitter let
me let me explain where I'm coming from
there dual channel and single channel
platforms but the memory itself isn't
made in a special way nor does it
contain some sort of special flippable
bit
that enables a so-called dual channel
mode on the memory for this reason
unless I slip up because I've been
running test for 18 hours you will never
hear me say the words dual channel
memory without following it up with the
words platform or configuration that's
pretty important when you're talking
about this dual channel memory is not a
standalone item that exists it's just
memory so hopefully that clears things
up I want to get that out of the way
first there are some special cases where
you enter higher channel counts like
quad channel or octave channel where the
memory will actually exhibit fairly
substantive differences as you increase
channel count and that's because of a
lot of things including and primarily
the higher density like in the range of
64 gigabits for example so that's that's
pretty impactful for your performance
and isn't necessarily quite as easy as
the dual channel stuff we're talking
about here today when you're using a
single stick of RAM the memory will
communicate via a 64 bit wide data
channel the channel can effectively be
thought of as a lane on a road with 64
bits of total width in a single channel
we're more limited in our maximum
throughput then a wider channel or
multiple channels will allow just like a
multi-lane Road using that analogy dual
channel platforms which all modern IMC's
and chipsets support sans Kabini will
utilize - 64 bit channels instead of one
effectively doubling the maximum
potential data rate of our memory as it
communicates with the CPU assuming
you've used a multiple of two sticks
this sort of pain ponds our data down
the channels so we've now introduced
parallelism to the memory by multiplying
the channel count this applies all the
way up the line if you've got quad
channel Ram multiply your channel count
by four and so on this is easy to
confuse with double data rate RAM or DDR
so be careful to make that distinction
it's it's a different thing they operate
independently of each other and a dual
channel configurations can only be
utilized when the RAM is socketed and
matching banks like Bank zero on most
boards some boards will support dual
channel configurations in both banks in
our testing in order to retain a
consistent memory capacity we used Bank
zero for dual channel config
regions that be slot 1 and 3 or 0 and 2
depending how you count it and we used
mismatched banks for what we'll call
single channel testing meaning slots 1 &amp;amp;
2 or 3 &amp;amp; 4 or whatever
alright so enough of that if you want
more information like this hit the
article link below and that will tell
you all the technical stuff it will
answer almost all your questions and
let's just dive into benchmarks right
away here the test platform and complete
test methodology are are pretty fleshed
out again in the link if you'd like to
run the test yourself and replicate my
results I've tried to enable this and I
encourage it please post a comment in
the article if you do some your of your
own testing because I'd love to include
it in our results in the future we'll
start with Euler 3d Euler 3d is a
computational fluid dynamics benchmark
shortened as CFD bench
I'll read directly from my article here
because it does a pretty good job at
explaining it oiler 3d is a simulation
benchmark simulation like this is a
computation intensive task that tends to
demand high-speed components and
multi-threaded processing so CPU and RAM
get hammered CFD uses a computer model
to calculate fluid flow which is air in
this case and my understanding I I
haven't I didn't program this I'm not an
expert on CFD my understanding is that
the test uses a complex matrix to
calculate fluid flow at multiple points
on whatever we're testing and it then
iterates over time with change in flow
at surrounding points so this in mind it
would mean that we have to store some
values and then access them upon each
iteration which becomes more and more
RAM intensive in terms of speed as the
test iterates the results here showed a
17.7% differential between single and
dual channel platforms that were tested
which is pretty damn substantial if
you're doing anything with simulation or
similar engineering like parametric
modeling or something it is reasonable
to presume that you could extrapolate
the data to those applications then
there's max mem this one benchmarks
memory copy read/write latency and
bandwidth and
you can see here that our Delta's were
upwards of 30% with the exception of
memory latency which was a couple
nanoseconds worse on the dual channel
platform this is likely due to overhead
and is substantial this is an entirely
synthetic benchmark so it's tough to say
how it relates to the real world but
that's what I'm here for so let's move
on to real-world stuff WinRAR is
something that you're all familiar with
we ran a WinRAR compression test to
calculate the advantage of running two
memory channels when archiving data and
our test we see a difference of
approximately two point eight seven
percent which isn't really that
impactful for consumers keep in mind
that this sort of three percent
advantage toward dual channel could be a
seriously important boon to enterprise
and server or database solutions where
archiving massive log files or indexes
on an hourly or faster basis would
demand any small gains that it can get
of course
these systems will also be utilizing
server architecture and are probably on
the far more channels than two but you
get the idea now we're on handbrake
handbrake starts showing some advantages
for power users on PCs that be
enthusiasts rather than just developers
and scientists like the previous tests
handbrake transcodes video from one
format to another and is often used for
ripping or converting video files and is
multi-threaded enabled making it good
for this test and our test handbrake saw
a four point four percent advantage with
dual channel configurations which is
starting to get somewhat noticeable now
for gaming benchmarks and and then we'll
move on to video editing I promise I
didn't expect any noticeable difference
here at all but I tested it for point of
clarity to kind of make a point shogun 2
is benchmark tested for a load time
advantage of only 0.78% for dual channel
configurations while the FPS tested at a
point to 1% increase on dual channel you
generally won't see FPS increases in
this regard with memory but that's
another that's another topic for a much
longer article both of these numbers are
well within margin of error they're less
than 1% and should be regarded as in
substantial I also tested load times and
fps in Skyrim and found
similarly low numbers as in less than 1%
Delta and I tested it in battlefield 4
but the test is yet inconclusive so far
they are in substantial but I need to
finish a few things so this gives us the
conclusion that at least these two or
three games will not see direct benefit
of dual-channel platforms and we could
probably extrapolate that to most games
here's where you see some video from my
test for Adobe Premiere I rendered out
this very complex ten-second clip
featuring for 1080p scenes at 60fps with
a 28 megabit per second framerate I
filmed all four of these and drop them
into this window you can see that there
is a rough 3% Delta favoring dual
channel here it's noteworthy and if
you're doing this sort of work you
should probably be running multiple
sticks anyway but even with the three
percent difference that's only two
minutes shaved off of every hour you
spend rendering so it's completely up to
you to determine whether that's
beneficial or not for me it can actually
pretty beneficial when I'm at a
convention and rendering you know 20
hours a day but still we're looking at
minutes here so now for After Effects
Adobe's AE has what is called a ram
preview that streams video data to
memory for live playback with
post-processing added in live that's the
key in this demo I created another reel
with four scenes at 1080p running 60fps
with a rough 28 megabit per second
framerate 24 in some cases this is the
the dual channel test we're looking at
the average frame rate of playback
including color correction and exposure
post-processing spits out at fifteen
point one fps for dual channel configs
and fourteen point two FPS for my single
channel config the delta here is almost
6 percent which could absolutely be a
big deal for those of you who regularly
do this kind of work so what's our
conclusion for all of this well here's
the thing generally it's cost-effective
to buy memory in kits however if you're
on an ultra budget say less than $500
and you see a single stick of RAM that's
maybe 8 gigabytes and you know something
absurd like $50 FSM forbid that is a
price available now then it's a don't
freak out about losing the dual channel
capabilities you can get by on one stake
of your quote unquote just a gamer right
it has a very little impact as we've
seen the places it becomes relevant is
largely going to be outside of the realm
of this audience they're going to be
server architects and enterprise and web
solutions and databases and things that
do really regular archiving or require
redundancy or require very rapid
accessing of data but on the enthusiast
side ignoring all things aesthetic it is
somewhat beneficial for a render rig if
you're doing a lot of rendering if you
are a scientist or you do a lot of
simulations or you're an engineer and
you work with parametric sand analyzers
and signal integrity and electro
magnetics it's definitely useful to have
it there just judging by the Euler 3d
test so that's kind of where I stand on
all this just to really make things
clearer if you are a gamer if it's out
of your price range don't go out of the
way to get a dual channel configuration
going so I know we blasted through those
numbers very fast and you've probably
got a lot of questions as to how I
validated everything and how I tested it
but fear not the test case was very
extensive and attempted to answer all
those questions and my own concerns
along the way I did have quite a few
concerns going into the tests that I
wanted to address so hit the link again
in the description below for that not to
not to verbally spam you with the link
but it is very comprehensive and that's
all for this time if you like this sort
of content please like comment and
subscribe let me know what else you want
to see in terms of pc myths we'll call
them and I will see you all next time
