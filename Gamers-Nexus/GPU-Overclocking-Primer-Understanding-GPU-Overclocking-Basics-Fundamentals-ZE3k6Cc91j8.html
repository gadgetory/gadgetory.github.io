Nexus tonight and today we're going to
be looking at overclocking your GPU
using software specifically EVGA is
precision although you can also use MSI
Afterburner and other utilities check
the description of this video for links
to those programs and also check the
link for the highly detailed overview of
overclocking where we give a primer of
what exactly overclocking is and why you
can do it this also covers CPU
overclocking in a separate video so we
see here in EVGA is precision X utility
that I have a GTX 580 from last
generation and there are a few quick
things to understand before we start
actually tweaking these settings GPU
overclocking as a whole is very simple
compared to other forms of overclocking
every microprocessor which includes CPUs
and GPUs has a base clock or core clock
for us today this is also referred to as
the GPU clock for the GPU we have
additionally a memory clock and some
GPUs will have shader clocks as well we
will go over these more in the following
minutes first let's define the GPU clock
the GPU clock itself or the base clock
in this case is the frequency at which
the GPU is operating more frequency
means a hotter chip but it also works
harder than the stock settings so it
will be faster but it will be hotter as
a whole the graphics processing units
clock speed will dictate the speed with
which the video card can handle requests
and commands that are thrown at it it's
the overall speed of the microprocessor
and the faster it is the faster it can
handle those requests and move on to the
next one some video rendering software
will take advantage of graphics cards
for their computational power so it is
always beneficial to overclock your GPU
and especially if you're gaming you will
normally see a couple FPS maybe 10 FPS
if you really push it hard I really push
it as far as you can but please be
careful with that you might see a 10 FPS
improvement for the most part there's
small improvements here and there the
memory clock on the other hand is the
second stat you'll see the memory clock
is fairly straightforward it's the
operating frequency of the GPUs onboard
memory and the memory clock can be
utilized to calculate the memory
bandwidth which is the most important
factor a lot of the time on a GPU think
of it sort of like a highway the more
lanes on the highway the more the cars
can fit through it at once it's no good
to have a ton of memory on your GPU if
you don't have the bandwidth to actually
push data to it quickly games that
utilize post-processing ambient
occlusion or other filtration based
effects will benefit more directly from
memory clock increases and more
noticeably than those that do not have
those effects Metro 2033 is a good
example of this if your card has a low
memory bandwidth
overclocking the memory clock will help
compensate for this detriment with that
said we have found that overclocking the
GPUs core clock is normally the most
immediately noticeable and leaving the
memory clock you can definitely get away
with so I leave that memory clock alone
and start with the core clock and log
those incrementally log your performance
increases incrementally and log the FPS
in your utilities a GPU that is pumped
up a bit through precision or
afterburner or other programs may help
push your graphics settings from medium
high to high ish if you've been on the
razor's edge so that's about the
performance you can expect to gain not a
whole lot it will keep you in the 30 FPS
range if you find yourself waning below
it though the next step is for you to
actually get out there and do it to
overclock your video card I would first
highly recommend enabling any form of
login and either precision or
afterburner and definitely enable FPS
logging so you can check that and it
will temperature logging the RPM of the
fan the tachometer and anything else
that seems relevant definitely logged
the course speed of the GPU or anything
else you've overclocked more data is
always better just cap those logs so
that they don't get too big for notepad
to open this will allow you to check the
logs in the event of a catastrophic
failure so you can see what exactly went
wrong you should also enable automatic
fan control so that the card will
modulate its own fan speeds thus helping
keep things cool and under serious
pressure you can manually set the fan
speed curve if that is more your style
we'd also advise running heaven of the
benchmarking utility or other video card
bench markers or a games even to really
stress out that card and test for
stability because just running it in
Windows won't really test
gonna crash or not so if you do
experience crashing with your
overclocked settings keep in mind that
you can increase the voltage to increase
the stability this will also increase
heat though and is generally not very
good for the chips lifespan so try to
keep that voltage as low as you can
don't increase it too much be very
careful when you're changing all of
these settings and always research your
specific cards overclocked
optimization settings online before
doing it and ask us in our forums if you
need specific help from us so with that
that is pretty pretty much everything
you need to know about video card
overclocking check our other video for
CPU overclocking and check our primer
guide it is a big guy that took a lot of
time to write so please check that out
below it will give you an overview of
everything about overclocking and please
like this video if you liked it comment
and subscribe as always we'll see you
guys next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
