2016 and before the show starts i had a
couple of quick hardware news items in
rapid-fire order and leading up to those
though this hardware coverage is brought
to you by cyberpower who make the fan
book that we overclocked past 4
gigahertz just recently so for the news
items coming out of the beginning of the
show here one of those is court shares
new rapid-fire keyboards they've got the
rapid-fire case 70k 65 and both of those
come in RGB variants so there's
effectively three keyboards the k70 has
a one with a non RGB and these are
priced at 170 dollars the k70 RGB rapid
fire and then a hundred and forty
dollars for the case 65 RGB rapid fire
at 130 dollars for the k70 rapid fire
non RGB what's new with these they
basically take the same housing that
you're used to for the most part from
the k70 and the other series keyboards
in that vengeance line and they add a
new type of switch so chary as you all
know make many different types of
switches and one of those new ones is
the cherry MX speed a switch which
activates at one point two millimeters
so it's definitely an aggressive
actuation depth and they actually about
forty percent faster than your standard
Cherry MX switches which in theory
anyway means that the sort of high-level
Pro gamers would potentially be able to
see a difference where they push the key
and they get just that much extra speed
on the responsiveness from the key press
but for folks like I would imagine most
of you non pro gamers I'm certainly not
one but that doesn't mean that they
shouldn't exist because ultimately
there's really no harm and having more
switches switch field comes down to the
user it's very subjective and whether or
not you get a real perceptible gain out
of that extra speed doesn't change the
fact if you like the switch feel or not
and if you like it then it's worth
looking into so that is the new MX speed
switch on the corsair k70 k65 and k70
with the RGB variant it now has a
synchronous lighting synchronized
lighting like the logitech devices have
these days so definitely some fierce
competition there from Corsair the next
news item is from MSI they've got a new
all-in-one computer called the aegis and
it's I guess supposed to resemble a bit
of a shield that sort of looks like a
shoe that Hermes might wear but it's
basically a normal tower on top of a
pedestal and it's kind of a smaller form
factor compact tower I don't know
exactly the specs just yet because we
haven't seen it in person but hope to be
doing a video on it while at the show
here at PAX East what I can tell you is
that it's got to 3.5 inch hard drive
cages that are easily accessible on the
bottom of the system it's got a 2.5 inch
SSD area in the same space as the hard
drive cages and those are all easily
accessible in terms of form factors the
video card support is effectively
everything it goes up to larger 980 TI
MSI certainly makes some of the largest
ones and they want to support those and
of course the 390 extra comparable am
these devices as well the last news item
is from AMD we're talking about the
Wraith cooler again so you may be
familiar with rate cooler from our
review but this shipped on the FX 8370
cpu a little while ago and that was all
it was available on now it's on the
flagship apu and as of today Andy will
begin shipping the Wraith cooler with
select 8350 and 6300 series 6350 CPUs
from their FX lineup you can still buy
the non wraith version of those they're
a bit cheaper expect to spend about ten
dollars more on the lower end devices
and about twenty to thirty dollars more
on the higher end devices with the
Wraith cooler and in theory that will
drop a little bit as the market
neutralizes newegg certainly sort of is
large enough to set their own prices in
some regards so do stay tuned for price
changes on that but the Wraith cool is
now available on more FX cpus a little
bit too little too late for me for the
most part but the good news here is that
the Wraith cooler is actually
legitimately good it's better I think
than the intel cpu cooler we've tested
them both all of them really and it's a
good step in the right direction for AMD
actually more than a step in the right
direction hopefully they move this
cooler to zen and future architectures I
imagine they would and if they do that
it's a pretty strong starting point
because generally with the NS 125 watt
cooler the Wraith cooler it's not really
necessary to buy an aftermarket cpu
cooler which
reduces your total build cost and that
plays largely in am DS favor as a budget
targeting CPU vendor so that's all for
the quick news item 3 news items for you
before PAX East starts we're gonna be on
the show floor when this video goes live
which will be 9am on Friday and we'll
have some news from several other
vendors for the day including logitech
can be talking to intel richard garriott
on friday or saturday and a couple of
other industry icons so do stay tuned
