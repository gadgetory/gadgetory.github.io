net and we're at Silverstone's suite at
CES 2016 looking at the new RL 05 be
enclosure sort of a mid-tower form
factor first off all of the CES 2016
coverage is brought to you by hi by
powers revolt to a small form-factor
gaming PC the RL 05 be enclosure is not
just yet but it's targeting a quarter
one launch and fill sort of this similar
market two cases like the s3 40 and the
60 dollar price range for the target as
this that's through 40 of course toward
70 and the main idea here is providing a
PSU shroud that's actually made out of
metal it's not a plastic shroud which is
always a positive and the psu shot of
course covering your power supply
further back towards the front of the
case our 3 3.5 inch hard drive bays so
you can mount your hard drives there and
then just above those are 2 2.5 inch SSD
slots for the normal rear of the tray
SSD mounting up in the top there's a
five and a quarter optical drive bay and
then in front of that or 2 1 40
millimeter fans set as intake there's a
120-millimeter slot back here but as we
understand it won't be filled stock
those two will be filled stock so got a
bit of a good air flow configuration
there with 140 s in the front in the
back normal power supply mounting back
here and then your expansion bays and
stuff like that so this is the RL 05 be
the external look of it you'll see in
the b-roll but there's a bit of a red
design on the front panel and everything
else is fairly standard in terms of i/o
and things like that check the article
link in the description below for more
information on this case check the specs
and dimensions and all that information
and again it's looking at a quarter one
launch this year and the 60 ish dollar
price point from at silverstone so that
is all for this quick shot at the
silverstone suite at CES 2016 check the
channel for additional coverage and
we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
