net and we're at silver stones suite at
CES 2016 looking at the new AR l05 B
enclosure it's sort of a mid tower form
factor first off all of the CES 2016
coverage is brought to you by high by
powers revolt 2 a small form factor
gaming PC the RL 0 5 B enclosure isn't
out just yet but it's targeting a
quarter one launch and feels sort of
this similar market to cases like the s
340 and the $60 price range for the
target as this that's through 40 of
course towards 70 and the main idea here
is providing a PSU shroud that is
actually made out of metal it's not a
plastic shroud which is always a
positive and the PSU shroud of course
covering your power supply further back
towards the front of the case are three
3.5 inch hard drive bays so you can
mount your hard drives there and then
just above those are two 2.5 inch SSD
slots for the normal rear of the tray
SSD mounting up in the top there's a
five and a quarter optical drive bay and
then in front of that or two 140
millimeter fans set as intake there's a
120 millimeter slot back here but as we
understand it won't be filled stock
those two will be filled stock so you've
got a bit of a good airflow
configuration there with 140 s in the
front in the back normal power supply
mounting back here and then your
expansion bays and stuff like that so
this is the RL 0 5 be the external look
of it you'll see in the b-roll but
there's a bit of a red design on the
front panel and everything else is
fairly standard in terms of i/o and
things like that check the article link
in the description below for more
information on this case check the specs
and dimensions and all that information
and again it's looking at a quarter wan
launch this year and the 60-ish dollar
price point from at silverstone so that
is all for this quick shot at the
Silverstone suite at CES 2016 check the
channel for additional coverage and
we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
