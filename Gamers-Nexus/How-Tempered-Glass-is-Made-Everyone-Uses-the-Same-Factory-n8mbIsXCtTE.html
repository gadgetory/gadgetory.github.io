entirely replacing acrylic side panels
and it's all happened in just the last
few years we visited the leading
tempered glass factory for electronics
while in China founded by a company that
started with tempered glass for
furniture and spawned an entire
standalone new factory entirely
dedicated to phones and computers
although coolermaster brought us to this
third-party Factory the same company
makes the glass panels for thermaltake
whose panels we saw lying around for the
new asus cases and for the famous Lian
Li 11 dynamic walking into the factory
saw us immediately presented with the 11
dynamic but also with curved glass
panels that are currently in prototype
phases that might be used for future
products these curved panels are
considered trade secrets and are so
difficult to make like the ones on the C
700 M by Coolermaster that the factory
won't even let Coolermaster the client
see how the panels are made if you've
enjoyed our factory tours the absolute
best way to make sure we can continue to
afford these expensive international
trips is to support us via the GN merch

below this Factory is widely used in the
industry so it's commonplace to see
glass made by competing case
manufacturers all in the same place the
factory produces about 5,000 pieces of
tempered glass for electronics every
eight hours often working two shifts for
12 hour days but also produces high
volumes of glass for furniture next door
the first step in the tempered glass
factory is to move giant sheets of
untempered glass made by another
supplier to a station where the panel's
can get cut to size each sheet weighs
about 45 kilograms or nearly 100 pounds
and has moved in large groups by ceiling
mounted cranes
operators secure the crane straps to
each side of the glass bundle then
relocate the glass to the cutting
station the glass next needs to move
into a cutting machine for safety
reasons and because it's so heavy
this is automated with a large machine
that's on Rails the machine rolls toward
the glass and uses about nine suction
cups to grab the glass the glass is
rotated to be horizontal then a series
of wheels roll it into a conveyor belt
which then moves it into the cutter a
diamond saw is used to cut a small
incision about halfway deep into the
glass pane with the cuts pre-programmed
depending on what's being made for each
day oil is poured in front of the
diamond blade as it moves helping cool
down the tool and create a smoother cut
the panel is slid down the table which
has embedded air vents to help move and
lift the glass it's exactly like an air
hockey table in this way the glass is
guided down to an operator who manually
splits the glass into the respective
squares and then shelves them for
further movement down the line the
factory was kind enough to allow us to
try this process despite working with
glass the diamond saw cuts may get
trivial to break the glass into the
final pieces so that the cuts are clean
and any unintentional breaks are rare
leftover glass from these cuts is thrown
into a dumpster which can then either be
brought to a third party that can
dispose of it or recycle it depending on
the use case the next step is a semi
custom grinding machine that is modified
by this factory the edges of the glass
have to be ground down for safety and so
they start by getting loaded bond ways
into the machine as the glass is wheeled
through the machine grinding wheels are
used to soften the borders of the glass
a chain rein under the machine is
attached to a motor which is then
connected to a chain that keeps the
machine in constant motion water also
constantly runs through this machine
acting as both a coolant for the glass
and the wheels and as a cleanser for
glass powder and dust the water flows
over the panels as they move through the
machine pulley each panel and then flows
out the back of the machine and sort of
a river into a cleaning system the water
is filled with glass powders and so it
has to get filtered before it goes back
into sewage it takes multiple grinding
wheels to fully smooth the glass so
after the
machine the glasses brought out onto a
green bungee cord and then automatically
rotated onto a series of wheels this
automation was made by the glass factory
and although it looks sort of packed
together is perfectly and efficiently
able to rotate panels of all sizes the
panels are then fed through another
grinding machine
this time configured for processing the
other sides of the panel the panels are
cleaned again with water and they
progress through the end of the line as
the panel's exit this machine human
intervention is finally required for the
first time in a few steps humans take
the panels to a high rpm grinding wheel
and manually grind down the corners as
the machines can't do this efficiently
or entirely independently at least most
of them can't skilled workers can get
through a single panel in a matter of
seconds making the process efficient
enough to not require automation as long
as the factory keeps up with demand the
next machine is another drill this time
using a steel drill bit to bore holes
into the glass the drill is programmed
for each size of glass and must be set
depending on the production run profiles
exist for common sizes but they often
need to be tweaked for each order this
is the slowest process of the entire
manufacturing conveyor belts as the
machine moves with more precision and
has limits on speed to maintain
integrity of the glass it has to be kept
at lower speeds and the factory also has
fewer of these drill machines so out of
all of the steps in the manufacturing
process this is the bottleneck depending
on the order CNCs can also be used
instead of some of these manual
processes corner grinding and custom
shapes can be cut by CNC is like cooler
masters mp5 30p custom shaped glass
panels and this does eliminate the human
corner grinding step we saw earlier the
downside is that this is a slow
expensive process
remember that machine time is the
biggest cost in any factory so the more
time that a machine spends making a
single panel the more expensive that
panel is that's time that could be spent
on making higher volumes of simpler
products CNCs are only used for complex
designs that need precision as each
panel takes a long time to cut one panel
can take at least 60 seconds but they
tend to go up to 90 seconds for the big
CNC much
and so these are reserved for complex
shapes there are six CNC machines total
in this Factory which means that a
highly complex panel with a 90 second
cutting time could be made at a maximum
volume of only 240 units per hour
assuming flawless operation with no load
times and no QC failure in reality it
would be a lot fewer than this this is
why it's better for a human to do the
edge grinds but better to use the CNC
for something like the mp5 30p or it
might be a weird trapezoidal shape that
a human can't quite do consistently
quality checks happen before temperance
reduced time wasted on bad panels the
glass is wheeled through a final water
cleaning process out of the cutting and
grinding machines then - - quality
assurance technicians this area uses
multiple bright 5,600 K fluorescent
lights to easily illuminate any minor
scratches or damage in the glass the
technicians use a template to check hole
spacing for the panel screws and then
move the panels to carts based upon
passage or failure of inspection the
next step is the furnace the furnace is
the most expensive part of the entire
process and for multiple reasons it
takes one to two days just to heat the
oven and because the factory shuts down
entirely every Sunday the furnace isn't
in full operation again until late
Monday or early Tuesday the slowest
production but for cost and safety
reasons it's better to turn the furnace
off when the factory is completely
unmanned between work days the furnace
is left running as it's more
cost-effective to spend on the
electricity than it is to shut it down
entirely and restart it burning more
electricity in the process of heating it
back up as for the furnace itself it's
about 30 meters long and costs 800
thousand RMB or about 120 thousand US
dollars as of March 2019 unseen costs
include the cost of the square footage
used by the factory for this furnace the
cost of maintenance and the cost of
electricity the upside is that minimal
human oversight is required as it's just
a lawn oven that cycles the glass
through each panel spends about two
minutes in the 30 meter long oven the
oven is heated to 700 degrees Celsius
ultimately tempering the glass into the
panels that we're all familiar with the
factory was kind enough to open the
furnace for us to see inside but we
open it momentarily as the heat rapidly
escapes and can cause slowdowns in
production wheels turn internally to
pull the glass through and if you're
looking closely you can see that they
reverse directions multiple times to
keep the glass in the furnace for longer
shattered glass can be found on the
floor beneath the furnace this is from
glass panels that might have had micro
fractures internally and so they could
not survive the tempering process the
result is effectively a safety glass
similar to what's made for windshields
as the glass shatters into at least 52
pieces for every 5 by 5 square for the
spec we were looking at this reduces
risk to the user in the event of a break
and is why it's called safety glass we
were allowed an opportunity to use a
breaking tool to intentionally destroy a
glass panel this tool is used on
randomly selected panel to try and
destroy them and check for the amount of
fractures it took us a few tries to
break the panel but with enough force
the needle is able to shatter the glass
you'd use a similar tool to destroy
windshields for example or windows in a
car if it were maybe submerged as they
apply targeted force to the glass and
can easily shatter it when blunt-force
wouldn't the glass is supposed to
shatter here as part of a quality check
and ensures tempering works properly the
number of pieces per 5x5 area must
comply with various safety guidelines to
be considered safety glass the next
quality test is to drop a 505 gram steel
ball from a 1.5 meter high pole and onto
the center of the panel if the randomly
selected panels survive this test the
batch is considered good after this
stickers are applied to panels when
necessary
and those appealable sheets of plastic
gets stuck to the panel's the tape is
applied by a machine then cut down by a
human operator on the other side the
glass is next sat upon a custom-made set
of four soldering irons spaced according
to each model of glass which are then
used to burn through the plastic in the
screw and standoff holes in the glass
panels some additional steps might
include silk-screening logos onto the
glass like some of these companies do if
that's the case a manual silk-screening
process is used for single color designs
where the screens are placed and cleaned
regularly the glass must then go through
an oven at 200 degrees Celsius to
the ink if the manufacturer uses
multiple colors for its logo the glass
is instead sent through an automated
silk screening machine which is capable
of producing 3000 pieces per day this is
more expensive to configure and is only
used for multicolor designs
finally the end step starts a buff and
polish the units some defects like minor
scratches can be buffed out of the glass
so that the glass doesn't go to waste
machines will move the glass onto
conveyer belts and clean the pieces one
final time and QC operators can do a
final inspection and polishing as needed
the defect rate will depend entirely on
the company buying the panel
Coolermaster has strict quality control
requirements for some of his panels
which results in about a 5 to 10%
rejection rate for panels used on its
mainstream cases some of those panels
can be fixed in the buffing steps but
the rest must be thrown away other cases
or companies with fewer QC requirements
would have a lower defect rate it
depends entirely upon how strict the
companies are and stricter requirements
of course result in higher costs because
there's more waste this factory is
working on prototyping new designs like
printing inside of tempered glass and
bending the glass
despite glass work being an ancient
trade it's still regularly advancing to
fit the needs of new computer and mobile
phone products all of which this factory
makes that's it for this tour as always
