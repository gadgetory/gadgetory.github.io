now at the enter Max booth having noise
had at me from this case mod so this is
an enter max case mod it was built in
the house to talk about the mod itself
and some of the stuff in it before we
get into that all this computex 2016
coverage is brought to you by msi and
the new x99 motherboards including the x
99 titanium so that stated here we've
got a pretty crazy case mod it's
obviously based on a theme of the
division which is Ubisoft's newest game
you can see the gas masks here in the
front it's got some of the ammunition
magazines rounds sidearm all this crazy
stuff mounts to its its let me put it
this way it's a very American in fact
this might be the most freeing American
thing we've seen since coming to Asia so
we got all the sidearms it makes noise
out the front I'm not sure that's
picking up on this mic but makes noise
and then on the inside there's a bit
more modding some custom paint on the
side panels but the interesting thing
here is some of the new hardware so from
enermax there is a new look max a giant
open loop liquid cooling solution that's
in here that's brand new and that has a
couple of things that are unique to it
one of them is it's got RGB LEDs in the
reservoir and those can be tuned by a
controller so you can actually use fan
of an RGB LED controller like found in
some of Bob Stewart's mods previously
like the roseville thrown case and it's
also got rpm control so that is part of
the Giants open source are open liquid
Luke cooler and the liquid itself is
included the tube soft tubes are
included and I think it's about a 299
300 dollar kit and we have some photos
of that we can show you as well so
that's the kit the power supply has been
out for a while it's just the enter max
flat max power supply nothing new there
other components in the system there's a
gigabyte SOC x99 board I'm not sure what
CPUs in here they haven't specified but
obviously a haswell-e x99 CP of some
kind and then memory that's using a
vector ssds it looks like two of them
may be on raid and then my favorite part
is he's gonna gtx 960 that has no power
connected so there's an empty 6-pin
connector which must be some new quantum
power technology or something or it's
just cuz they want to put it on display
and that is connected to the open loop
liquid cooling as well and I've now said
those words in the correct order so
everything is right in the universe but
that's all we got for you for a quick
thing
the animatics case the division the case
mod I asked you built it I didn't get a
name but it was made in the house which
is cool it's definitely different so
yeah as always patriotic emotional video
thanks for watching at links on the
description below for further computex
coverage I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
