CES 2019 and we have something special
for you it's the msi lightning z28 ETI
and this one there were some leaks
online of the PCB but from what I saw
none of those leaks had the cooler and
we have that here for you today it's
still getting finalized so this thing
isn't 100% done yet but release date or
at least the model here isn't release
date is January 22nd priced TBD but what
we do know is some about the cooler and
the V BIOS before that this video is
brought to you by the gigabyte Z 390 a
RS master motherboard which comes
equipped with one of the more powerful
z3 90 V RMS for heavier overclocks on
the new 9th Gen Intel CPUs the ARS
master is also one of the few
motherboards with a real heatsink this
generation featuring a mix of high
surface area fins and looks oriented
hover blocks oh and it's also got
updated RDV illumination learn more at
the link below so from the cooler side
first of all you've got some gold
plating on there but that's just
aesthetic stuff so up to you if you like
that or not it is a triple fan design
the thin stack and the heatsink it's
going to be where most of the interest
is and that's because they are using it
looks like eight heat pipes so most
there are two of those that are eight
millimeters by eye and then the
remainder are six millimeter heat pipes
and those route through the entirety of
the rest of the fin stack the backplate
as we've seen in previous msi designs
does have a heat pipe on it as well so
there is a backplate here with well the
back plates got a let's see that looks
like another six or eight millimeter
heat pipe told it's composite which is
noteworthy so composite heat pipe those
tend to be like a mixture of materials
typically with heat pipes you have mesh
sintered weave composite this is a
composite key pipe from what we
understand today there are thrown pads
on the back these are extra thick
they're all pads but there's a reason
for it because the backplate has sort of
a curved design on it so to elevate it
off and make sure there's component
clearance they did have to use the
larger they're all pads as for LEDs of
course have to talk about those there's
an OLED on top of the card we have
b-roll of that and it shows similar to
the MSI godlike mother
the OLED can show a display of clock
speed temperature you can have like an
animation on it if you want that's your
your kind of thing so I think that
covers most the basics of what we've
seen here there are a couple of more
advanced elements to note on the cooler
and one of them is going to be the air
flow control they're calling it which is
on the right side of the card so similar
to what we saw with some of the EVGA
designs recently where they really
advanced like just drilling holes
through for example the fins stack MSI
is also advancing just the simplicity of
the the heatsink to a point where it can
exhaust on that air a bit more
efficiently get it out of the card
faster so you're not limited to just the
top and bottom exhaust because that's
the fin or Ian tation for the rest of V
by oh so that's worth note there are two
bios options on here there's a switch
and one of them is a 350 watt v bios
that's stock out of the box bare-bones
and then the other one is supposed to be
they're not 100% confirmed yet but 500
550 watts something in that range and
then there might be like an unlocked B
bios that Nvidia will be providing for
the higher end cards like this one in
the future
so covers v bios got the cooler and the
the base plate we can't show you today
base plate and the PCB are the model
here is a static demo it is not final so
we can't show that unfortunately I don't
know the MOSFETs on it I know that it's
a 16 plus three-phase so V ma'am 3 and V
core 16 phases and then the base plate
will have a sort of like pin fins on top
of it
so for in terms of service area that's a
good thing to see for the base plate but
the rest of it TBD we'll find out once
we have one so that covers the Lightning
just a quick note there are some 2060
models here as well so this would be one
of them and I mean it's it's 20 60s will
probably be reviewing these depending on
how popular the card is because as of
now reviews just went live so we'll keep
you posted on 20 60s but let us know
what you think about the Lightning and
hopefully we get a chance to look at the
full PCB once it's done thank you for
watching as always subscribe for more
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
