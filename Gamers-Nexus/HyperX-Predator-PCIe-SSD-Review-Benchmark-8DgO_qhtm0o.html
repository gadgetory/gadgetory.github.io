the new HyperX pci express SSD and this
is called the HyperX predator there's
actually an MDOT - SSD and MDOT he's
been around for a little while it is
very common in smaller mobile devices
but it's worked its way into some
desktops as well including x99 and some
high-end z97 systems however MDOT - is
not always a usable form factor for SSDs
when we're putting them into desktops
and there are a few reasons for this
that will go into momentarily the HyperX
predator drive although it is an MDOT -
SSD it actually uses a PCI Express
adapter card about this big and it's a
half-height half-length adapter card and
what we do is plug the m2 SSD
into that card it ships already
connected if you buy it that way and
then plug that into a PCI Express slot
so a few things about this device in
terms of specifications the HyperX
predator SSD is using a Marvel
controller the 92-93 controller it is a
dual core SSD controller it's
effectively akin to a flash processor
unit as Alice I used to call it but most
other vendors including Samsung and now
LSI or Stanford and of course Marvell
called a controller and the 92-93 is a
dual core unit it is capable of
four-lane connection via the PCI Express
of bus which bypasses some of the
abstraction layers faced by SATA the
device is connected by eight channels as
most controllers do with the flash
module so the eight channels go to
different flash modules Kingston is
presently using the Toshiba a 19 toggle
NAND 4 it's NAND flash but of course
that can always change and the a 19 NAND
is 64 gigabit it is the present Toshiba
generation of NAND for consumer devices
and that's what they're using here the
HyperX predator ships and two capacities
presently 240 gigabytes and 480
gigabytes now if you do the math on this
it's actually 512 as most 480 SSDs as
all 480 SSDs are but you lose some of
the data and you lose that
things like over-provisioning which
we've explained in the past so the
HyperX predator ships at about $1 per
getting a little bit lower and you won't
see these prices right now but as
retailers continue to sell and adopt the
drive for retail you will see that the
480 gigabyte model sells for have four
hundred seventy dollars to 40 gigabyte
models housing the 200s and all that
information is available linked in the
article in the description below please
check that out for more details so
talking about device performance that's
what everyone cares about here SSDs are
both easy and hard to benchmark properly
our SSD test methodology has been peer
reviewed by Kingston by Samsung and a
couple of other vendors by LSI and
controller manufacturers it's been peer
reviewed and analyzed and they provided
feedback for us to make sure we're
testing it properly the reason it's easy
is because a lot of it can be done using
synthetic software we don't have to
manually run around in games like we do
with GPU testing requires a lot of
manual effort with SSDs we can run a lot
of software but the hard part is taking
all of that information which is very
dense and then stripping out the parts
that are irrelevant to most users like
gamers and production power users like
us and then further the challenge we
face next is presenting that data in a
matter which is actually comprehensible
rather than just pasting screenshots of
ATT o which is I have trouble
understanding that and I look at it
health K so that's that's the challenge
we face so some things I want to talk
about before we get started here I did
an intensive study of i/o during games
so this used HD tuned to log the i/o
transactions made when games were
loading and when games were playing and
this tells us how many i/o requests were
made during each games or each sequence
of the game during loading and then it
further tells us what type of i/o that
is what how long the i/o is so for K 16
K and so on and then we look at the
queue depth which is another important
factor that's effectively how many files
or excuse me how many i/o requests are
lined up in sequence to be executed by
the device and in the case of gaming we
found that queue depth of 1 &amp;amp; 2 are very
common and after that it sort of
what type of game you're playing with
files you're loading in terms of i/o
length we learned that for K random of
course still very important for K random
qd1 especially and then after that the
reads and the reads are most popular at
16 K 32k and then the rights are at 16 K
and of course for K as I mentioned
before some of the higher sized writes
occur at 64 K depending on the game and
I have all that shown in the charts on
the article if you can't catch that
through YouTube fast enough we take all
this data and then use a mix of
benchmarking software like anvils
storage utilities to run tests the
fitting of those transactions so it's a
simulation of gaming but it is a
scientifically designed one the problem
though is that even with a very high
transaction speed we still face issues
in the software bottlenecks where you
you hit a point of diminishing returns
very rapidly and this occurs with the
PCI Express device that we're talking
about today and all other PCI Express
devices in such a fashion that once you
put an SSD in a system you really don't
you stop seeing any improvement beyond
that to your game performance but
there's a large improvement to things
like workload tasks so Photoshop video
editing and premiere After Effects and
other software in that effect there's
better compression and then of course
better file copy and transfer speeds so
let's let's get to the benchmarks
finally first I want to show you the PC
mark performance this is a synthetic
utility that executes real-world traces
so the developers future mark took
traces of applications like Photoshop
Premiere Illustrator every Adobe suite
program they took traces of some games
and of office and then they execute
those on the SSD in a fashion that is
replicable on all devices without as
much test error as if it were being done
manually by me so this is why we use
that you can see the largest improvement
with Photoshop transactions so photo
shops execution time of heavy workload
batches is about 4% faster than the 850
Pro when using a piece
express drive and you'll notice that
there are no other PCI Express drives on
here right now that's because the HyperX
predator is the first one we're testing
we hope to look at Intel 750 SSD in
short order but do keep in mind that all
these competing devices were showing are
not necessarily actually competing
they're in different price points and
they use the SATA interface so the
biggest improvement between PCIe and
SATA is in Photoshop as seen here and
then we can look at file copy speeds so
this is a test called a SSD which uses
incompressible data that means that the
data has already been compressed to a
point that windows can an SSD can no
further compress it so technologies like
sand forces door I really don't play it
too well here because they they really
they have nothing to do it's already
been done for them the files that are
incompressible are generally mp3s
movies like mp4s and images JPEGs are
already very heavily compressed as many
of you know so this is considered
incompressible data in our
incompressible test you can already have
seen the numbers now while I've been
babbling for a minute and the fastest
speed we ever saw with the HyperX PCIe
SSD the predator using compressible data
was almost 1.4 gigabytes that is
tremendous it's extremely fast and no
SATA drive can possibly reach that speed
because the SATA interface after
overhead is about 550 megabytes per
second before overheads clocha to 750
but you'll never see that speed because
there's all kinds of overhead and
abstraction and the transfer our
in-house gaming test using anvil storage
utilities which you can download for
free but we've we've modified with these
settings and you can also replicate
these we use 67% incompressible data
which is fairly realistic to live use
and you can see that the HyperX PCIe SSD
does excel in many cases and some of
them like 4k it's fairly similar or even
surpassed by the Samsung 850 Pro no well
that as I said before this does not
really reflect an in-game improvement so
in our heavily modded version of Skyrim
which is very large fast travel loading
non cell what
is a difference of less than a second so
between the 850 Pro the HyperX 3k which
is slower the OWCA Drive and the
predator we see a disparity of less than
one second between eight and nine
seconds every time to load Whiterun so
you will not see a gain in gaming
however concluding everything that we've
just gone over you will see performance
gains in Photoshop swirl ODEs at about
four percent from the Samsung 850 pro
four percent isn't a lot if you are a
production user who is using Photoshop
all day whether it's automated or not
you may want to consider something like
a PCI Express Drive because when you're
using it that much four percent can
actually be fairly a fairly good result
for heavy intensity workloads and file
transfers like copy and we see a massive
gain more than two times the transfer
rate more than three times the transfer
rate of a lot of SATA SSDs but beyond
that the the performance gains are
really at a point where they're
unnoticeable and many core user
applications so all the speed data aside
it's also important to talk about
usability you would want a PCIe adapted
MDOT two SSD in the case where one your
motherboard has no MDOT to support -
you're on a z97 board where there
actually is a performance disparity
between em - and the adapted PCIe
version this is something that's been
tested in-house by Kingston and other
Manek manufacturers excuse me the
downsides to using PCI Express are also
obvious you consume a PCIe slot so
you've suddenly limited your SLI and
crossfire capabilities on has well and
z97 z87 whatever there is a very limited
lane availability so you've got 16 lanes
from the CPU and eight from the chip set
of at z87 or better and that means
you've got about twenty four lanes total
exactly 24 lanes and those are divvied
up between your MDOT 2 or PCIe SSD and
your your video cards so if you have an
X 16 video card that 69 is gone
immediately if you have another one
you're depending on your configuration
you could be at 24 or 32 lanes it might
be a multiplex board that allows that
and
beyond that point you really have no
room for an SSD so there will be some
throttling or limitations in that regard
and in that case you would really want
an X 99 board which has upwards of 40
lanes available so those are some of the
concerns here with solid state drives I
want to really emphasize that you need
more than speed it's very important to
pay attention to endurance at this point
endurance is very difficult for us to
test in a timely fashion
in that it is impossible to test in a
timely fashion by the nature of it so we
do run a sort of passive endurance tests
in the background if we ever find a
problem will update but that might be a
point at which you've already purchased
a device so beyond endurance items to
consider would be things like the
controller and the NAND used which can
be used as an indicator of the endurance
and this is all stuff we discussed in
the article and full detail if you need
help deciding if I have this combination
of NAND controller and this manufacturer
is it really gonna survive in the long
term and then there's things like
encryption the 850 Pro is more
affordable far more affordable than the
HyperX predator and it's got full AES
Drive encryption and it has opal
compliance and a couple of other
business class features that I'm not a
hundred censure if the predator offers
all of those although the predator is
faster so that's your disparity in
pricing so that's the full review of the
HyperX predator I know it's pretty
in-depth but this is our first SSD
review we've done a video of so I want
to make sure everyone understands how we
test and the critical aspects of
determining which SSD you should buy
please leave a comment below if you're
curious about anything we do a lot of
SSD content I'll help you out if I can a
tweeting at us is really the best thing
to do at gamers Nexus on Twitter I
respond very quickly on there and thanks
for watching I will see you all next
time
