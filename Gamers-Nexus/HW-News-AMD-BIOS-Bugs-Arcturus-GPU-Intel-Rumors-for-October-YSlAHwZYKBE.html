hardware news recap for the week
we are finally past most of the AMD
product reviews there's still more to
come but hopefully hopefully AMD month
will be over soon and we can start
focusing on a wider range of things in
the space it was a lot all at once this
week though we still have some follow-up
coverage like and the AG sub BIOS bugs
that have been outed in the new ABA
version of a GA 1003 follow up on the
J's to cents versus me charity
overclocking battle we did it's
basically a show match we did for an
eight hour stream on our n 20 hour
stream on EBG A's and AMD Arcturus and a
couple of other news items before that
this video is brought to you by us and
the gamers Nexus toolkit on store
cameras axis net our brand new toolkit
just launched and contains 10 custom
made drivers for video card disassembly
reap hasting and tear downs the 8 core
tools are made of high-quality chromium
vanadium alloy steel that's built for
long service life and resistance to wear
during use the other two tools are
carbon steel hex heads that were custom
ground down for capacitor clearance on
video cards all the tools are easily
mounted to a pegboard or stored in the
GN made tool bag for easy transport
learn more at the link in the
description below so the update on that
overclocking battle if you missed or
didn't watch the entirety of the 8 hour
stream we don't blame you but more or
less what happened was in the first
segment of the stream we did a master
class with kingpin Vince Lucido from
EVGA who is God he has his name on the
kingpin card so that's who he is and he
showed us basics like setting the card
up how he would recommend and sign an
Allen to pot and sawing the heater for
the memory which is actually critical to
operation stuff like that and then once
we got past that phase we J and I each
picked a card to run there were four of
them
we were told although we're not sure if
this is entirely true we were told that
there was one dud one really good card
and then two that we're about equal and
long story short we ended up with a back
and forth leapfrog battle for the eight
hour period so I placed the first score
it held as the top score for probably a
couple hours J ended up beating that one
and he beat it right
and I was in the middle of having a lot
of issues with my system and then I end
up beating his about thirteen seconds
later though because I finally had a
test pass complete successfully for we
were using Port Royal for the whole time
so the scores ended up being about
twelve thousand three hundred forty
three points I think for mine J's was
twelve thousand two hundred fifty five
and then the best part is that we then
said you know what we're done Jay and I
were going to step back and Vince why
don't she show us how it's done
so then kingpin steps in and in probably
under ten minutes
he beat both of our scores and said okay
let's go get dinner so it shows you the
the kind of you know this isn't as easy
just pouring Alan to and pouring Alan to
is actually the most important skill as
he demonstrated in that segment so if
you want to see that part it's probably
in the last twenty minutes of the
streamer so and we'd recommend washing
it just because you can see a real pro
do what he what we did in eight hours
except he does it in ten for 15 minutes
max so yeah that was the stream now as
far as the the charity end of it EVGA
was celebrating its 20th anniversary
they're raising money for st. Jude's and
Jays local kingpin had to visit anyway
we flew out there so it was a pretty fun
event they streamed for 20 hours we were
on for eight and I believe they raised
overall it was approaching $12,000 at
the end of it all said and done so as
over it was maybe eleven thousand six
hundred something like that which is
really damn good so really happy to see
the success of their stream let's I
think they said the most money they've
ever raised they do this for st. Jude's
I think every year and most they've ever
raised in one go we contributed a
thousand dollars to that and to try and
match some of our community's donations
during that stream so really fun thanks
for supporting and good cause and all of
that and also we got to see a fun
overclocking battle now this isn't done
Jay and I still have a lot to go
head-to-head with and we're both looking
forward to getting back to some of the
crazier not Alan to stuff crazier being
like insane and kind of convoluted
chilled or other water cooling setups to
try and best each other and overclocking
so a lot more to come but thank you for
watching and there's your very quick
recap if you want to
and on the scenes recap J posted a video
of course J's two cents on YouTube and
he goes through the whole process in
about a 15 minute video or so and covers
it pretty well
so there's your recap on the stream next
up and the g-virus bugs can't go forth
in a week without talking about BIOS
updates right now following Andy's end
to difficulties with things like random
number instructions for destiny to Linux
distributions and the ship to BIOS
update it was a GC version one zero zero
three a B a previously there is one zero
zero three a B sometimes called combo
and then there was one zero zero three a
10100 2 so 1 0 0 3 ABA 1003 ABA has been
to our understanding retracted at this
point and 1003 a B is still the current
recommended BIOS update if you're having
issues with destiny 2 there will be a
fix it is in the pipeline but the 1003 a
B a version of the code had some new
bugs that asus noted it encountered
shamino from asus specifically noted
this so they ended up backing off of
that that firmware release for now so
there are updates on the pipe it should
fix the destiny 2 issues should fix some
of the other Linux distribution issues
but it's just it's too buggy otherwise
and as a quick refresher on this and how
it works basically Andy provides a
prepackaged set of code to the
motherboard manufacturers called Ajitha
and that code is a binary so they
deliver it to the motherboard makers as
binary code and then the motherboard
makers implement it into their existing
UEFI package or their BIOS package and
one thing that is not clear for the
motherboard manufacturers is what part
of the code does what because it's all
just binary to our understanding so
digging out things like PCIe gen 4 as a
toggle switch and retiling it back on
isn't as easy as just finding the the
commented line of code and changing it
they have to actually dig through and
figure out which part of the code
relates to that feature to then try and
sort of hack it back on although it's
permitted hack it's not necessarily a
quick one to do there's trial and error
involved and finding it and obviously
some of these vendors have already found
it because they've shipped updates that
should work with Gen 4 on the older
boards but AMD is trying to turn that
off going forward anyway though a G's
1003 a BA has been retracted and they
will reship it once it's fixed backs up
a rumor Intel and AMD both ready and cpu
launches for end of year this part is
mostly known at this point but there are
some rumors in here as well so there's a
new report from digit times that
suggests that the HCC or high core count
CPU wor will heat up this fall the x86
space is as competitive as it's been in
years with AMD having just released its
Rison 3000 desktop parts the r5 3600
getting a particularly good review from
us we also know AMD still has the 16
core 32 thread or 939 50 X waiting in
the wings with a committed September
launch for that one it's unlikely the am
for socket will support anything beyond
16 cores so that leaves the TR socket
and the Zen 2 based thread Ripper that's
due out at some point something Andy has
been tight-lipped about according to
digit x citing motherboard vendors as
sources and he is making moves to ready
thread room for 3,000 parts for an
October launch and evil has to do
something significant with next-gen
thread Ripper particularly at the bottom
of the stack because the ro 939 hundred
acts already puts tremendous pressure on
the threader 429 50x the ro933 X will
only exacerbate that and could even
punch above its weight class and
threaten the threader 429 70 WX early
speculation suggests that thread report
3000 could top out at 64 cores and 128
threads with support for eight channel
memory but none of this has been
confirmed yet Intel's next move though
is less clear than Andy's and these
pretty much revealed their whole hand at
this point for Intel bringing cascade
Lake to X 299 in the form of cascade
Lake X would be a sensible move that's
one scenario there's talk of X 399
glacier falls chipsets ignoring those
fake comet Lake slides there's also a
comet Lake CPU at some point and tile
could begin rolling out certain comet
Lake models for Z 390 which is
essentially a refreshed coffee like
refresh
and we were also aware of motherboards
codenames z4 98 present but we don't
know if that's gonna be the final name
for the chipset we know that mother wood
manufacturers have what they are calling
z4 90 boards whether it's ships that way
is to be determined we also know that X
299 the current chipset is what will be
used for the next immediate h EDT launch
for intel so that X 499 chipset as we
already talked about previously that was
seen at Computex that was a fake it was
a temporary naming it was a 299 chipset
it was next to 99 G brand motherboard
from gigabyte and that G isn't an Intel
thing that's a gigabyte thin so X 299
will persist for the immediate launch X
399 maybe for something after that we
don't know and then Z 490 is a thing
that's out there whether or not that's
the final chipset name we're not certain
either
so anyway Intel's me was a lot less
clear speaking of Intel Intel CEO cited
quote aggressive goals as one of the
leading causes to blame for its CPU
shortage that had been going on for
about two years until CEO Robert Swan
was recently at the fortune brainstorm
tech conference where he discussed a
number of topics including what he
believes to be a key factor in Intel's
pervasive CPU shortage so Juan describes
the delay as quote somewhat a function
of what we've been able to do in the
past which is in essence defying the
odds so on further explains by saying
quote at a time when it was getting
harder and harder we set a more and more
aggressive goal from that it just took
us longer
this is congruent with what Intel has
stated in the past about its 10
nanometer hurdle specifically by
pursuing a node shrink with an overly
aggressive transistor density Intel's
obviously encountered some problems
Intel's 10 nanometer delay has led to
the company having to use it's ironclad
grip on many market segments where Andy
has been able to make notable progress
included in notebooks Chromebooks and
the enthusiast segments obviously next
news item is about a rebrand another one
this one's Toshiba memory and Toshiba
memory is going to become cheok si Akio
Xie we're not sure kkeok SIA maybe so
Toshiba had to spin off its lucrative
memory business when it was facing some
issues
with bankruptcy the smallish is with
being bankrupt and this was sold as
Toshiba memory corporation for 18
billion dollars to Bain Capital the plan
was to eventually go for an IPO and it
was still to our knowledge going to be
touchable memory but that's changed so
ahead of making a public offering the
name change in order is supposed to move
from the recognizable Toshiba memory to
the new we're gonna go with
kkeok SIA effective this October and
feel free to correct us on the
pronunciation so Shiba explains that
this new name is a combination of the
Japanese word kioku meaning memory and
the Greek word axia meaning value may be
key axia is it clear that this is a bad
name to choose name changes aside there
doesn't appear to be any shift and the
way toshiba is intending to approach its
memory business or former toshiba anyway
so Sheba is still recovering from power
outages that left it with a severe nand
deficit and several acts of Wight's of
nand affected discussed in our previous
news video and now i guess we'll wait
and see what happens with this rebrand
and spinoff and these Arcturus could be
a Vega based workstation GPU this is
another sort of rumor item Sofer onyx
managed to grab some lines of code in
the Linux drivers that pertain to and
these artists GPUs and this suggested
that Arcturus could be a Vega based
workstation card for onyx specifically
spotted GFX 908 device IDs which would
be in theory relatable to the GFX 906
and 907 device IDs of previous AMD Vega
20 GPUs so furthermore and these roadmap
has indicated that the post Navi
graphics cards will be fabricated at 7
nanometre + so Arcturus could be a
refreshed Vega 20 presumably with HP m2
and features like ECC the Linux code
shows lines for 3 device IDs and the
lineup could consist of at least three
models so it's possible we might hear
more about Arcturus at SIGGRAPH 2019 or
at hot chips
but that's all we know for now and then
finally NZXT is expanding its BLD or
build service for pre-built pcs and the
reason we're including this news item is
specifically because the expansion is
adding a couple of Rison parts not
something you see from it's getting more
popular but not something you see from
all of the sis just yet this is
something where Andy spoke with us at
CES and and weary of this year 2019
about how its most immediate target was
to get in front of SI system integrators
and get placement and more of the
pre-built systems that get shipped
because Andy had already felt pretty
confident and the enthusiast market at
this point and was missing out on the
pre-built market for obviously a very
wide audience whether or not you think
it's worth the money a lot of people do
buy pre-built so NZXT these are upgrades
here the company is now offering
machines through BLD service that are
branded as being gaming and streaming
machines a unique selling point and one
that's valid for sure this will be
initially offered in three
configurations all shipping the day
after ordering interestingly NZXT is
using and the second-generation on all
the pre-built and they come with the H
500 chassis and DX T's 2-year warranty
on purchases things like that for gamers
targeting 1080p gaming and zxe starter
build includes a rise in v 2600 and an
nvidia gtx 1660 the build also comes
with 16 gigabytes of RAM and a 500
gigabyte m2 SSD this is NZXT s starter
PC they call it and it'll go for $900
for $1000 the user upgrade is gtx 1660
TI and a one terabyte SSD from 1500 and
ZT is offering a rise in seven 2700 x
and RT x 2070 16 gigabytes of ram and
650 watt psu with a one terabyte SSD all
the builds use and these bundles wraith
coolers as well as MSI's tomahawk be 450
motherboard so that'll be it's
interesting it's interesting because the
2000 series is actually extremely
competitive right now especially with a
and these newest launches so from that
perspective it's it's it's a good time
to offer 2000 series systems we're not
sure how long those CPUs will be around
we don't know if they're still being
made or not at the moment or how many
are in
but apparently there's enough for NZXT
and other companies to still offer them
so maybe that's the news for the week
