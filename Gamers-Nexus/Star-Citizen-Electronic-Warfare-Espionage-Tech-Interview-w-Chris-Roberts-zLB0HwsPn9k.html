nexus Donna and I am joined by chris
Roberts once again and we are talking
about some of the community questions
that you all submitted so today we're
going through a couple reddit post and
some posts from our own users that look
at things like the x12 and mantle and
the back end and that a couple of
specific gameplay elements with the
technical stuff we spoke previously last
year at PAX East about the server
back-end and a couple of how you're
dealing with nodes and things like that
to handle latency how is that coming
along whether your plans are keeping
clients in sync well we're looking out
and I mean that's actually one of the
big reasons why we sort of push back the
dogfighting module and it's one of the
big reasons why it's not going to be out
right after pax is because we want to
get the system right and beyond the
proper services that the actual game is
going to be on so it's a fairly
complicated system for thing that we're
trying to build to handle as many users
and so it has lots of different levels
so you know like a on a on a simplistic
level because each most of the service
levels have multiple servers handling
different aspects of it you know there's
going to be sort of three levels one the
universe level which is if you think of
the universe server which is actually
gonna be a cluster of service but let's
just say the University of it it holds
all basically all the players and what
they have and then sort of general
status you know likes dislikes and
general location and then the next level
down is what we call the system servers
which is basically a server that sort of
handling the system star system part so
star system part would basically be in
charge of all the players that will be
in that star system
and matchmaking them when they sort of
cross each other's paths and when
there's player crosses each other's path
to get handed off to the local instant
server and that's where any sort of you
know like flying around combat all that
kind of stuff first-person combat
whatever would all be resolved on an
instant server so sort of goes universe
the system to instance and it sort of
hands it off and so a lot of handshaking
handing off and tracking which is kind
of even though we don't have star
systems of all the rest of stuff we're
using a bunch of those servers in the
back end of the dogfight it sounds like
a lot of that is custom outside that's
all I mean all the back all the back end
there's nothing to do with grey yeah so
the back end is all completely new on
our side on the CryEngine side there's
some low-level network transmission
stuff that's actually fine so we use
that but basically the whole server in
terms of all the structure I talked
about is completely new and custom and
it's thinking with technical aspects for
a second you worked with AMD a while ago
it I wanted their own Vale events was
that at Montreal no no no was in Hawaii
that's right so Montreal was it it was
an nvidia event so sorry Andy so that
was for the Hawaii garden update and
they were pushing mantle pretty heavily
at the time you said you were planning
to use it and now we've got a lot of
dx12 talk going on especially with gtc
and GDC right behind us what's how is
CID working too well we're gonna sit
we're gonna support both of them you
know mantle and the x12 I mean you know
we supported mantle because like we're a
big believer in like getting rid of all
the blow in the operating system and
just getting straight to the metal one
of the big one of the big problems and
PC development is you have sort of
windows sitting between you and your
hardware and it's a big resource blow
and it gets in the way and especially
sort of on the game side and the today's
game world where everyone's on
multi-core CPUs you know dx11 it's not
particularly well set up for handling
multitasking or being very efficient in
that case so mantle one of the things
mantle did was allow you to do
that so draw calls are a big problem on
on pc games in terms of every you know
the reason why i like a concert like an
xbox one or ps4 can match say some pcs
with much you know much less powerful
hardware is because they don't have all
these operating systems so they could do
yeah they can do you know so like you
know they can do 10,000 plus draw calls
a frame whereas on a pc you start to get
bottlenecked cpu wise by three four
thousand dress even though the pc could
have a much more powerful GPU singh in
it so so mantle and now dx12 i mean i'm
quite happy because i think a lot of
people supported mantle and that sort of
forced the hand microsoft to you know
kind of like do something with directx
so I that's kind of my whole goal was
like I hate this we need this sort of
stuff so I'm supporting it and you can
sort of see what's happening everyone's
like oh we better get on this bandwagon
or else we'll get left behind but it's
just gonna make for better games and so
that means that you can have more draw
calls per frame and a higher frame rate
which means more detailed scenery
characters environments objects there
are yeah we need it for star citizen
because you know our ships are
incredibly detailed the characters are
incredibly deal to us their environment
seem incredibly detailed so we're going
beyond what you know people call
next-gen in terms of face count you know
if I could share polygon count on a on
character models some of the smaller
ships well it sort of a character models
are probably ninety to a hundred
thousand like something like the Hornets
probably about three hundred and
thousand or so you know something like
the constellations a million and a half
so it's bit I mean it's big so I mean
obviously that's not that's the full hi
Polly know you know not not lodd version
that's what you get up close as all
those fares but it's a lot to move
around but we've we focus on high poly
much more so than having detail and
textures because you know our big design
challenges that we got to go from sort
of first-person all the way up to you
know kill me too plus long ships and so
we need everything to hold up so I
you could still be in that sort of
first-person mode go up that massive
ship and you don't have huge pixels in
front of you so we need the details so
we tend to move towards geometry /
texture detail like a lot of times like
standard thing in games that you do
panels and stuff that all be baked into
the texture with normal maps and so we
don't really do that like most of them
especially the bigger ships you take a
look at and even on the fighters a lot
of the panels are actually modeled in
geometry and what that means is like
first time well yeah more depth and it
looks better more realistic but also
like I can show you on you know I run on
a 4k monitor in my office but I could
get you on a 4k and I can zoom right in
and say to the Hornet and it holds up
coming real close on a 4k and you
couldn't do that are the old way when
everything was baked into textures
because then you start to get to texture
resolution right but we sort of focus
more on the textures being sort of
general materials and then occasionally
put detailing with textures but you know
we're sort of because we move to
physically based rendering sort of we're
more sort of geometry detail you know
even like nuts and bolts will get get
model I think in the dog biting unveiled
you showed a first pass of PBR yeah yeah
well the sort of Hornets or basically
all the ships the environments are all
PBR the hangar is sort of a quick PBR
pass but it has not been done properly
in one I showed but it makes a massive
difference I mean just the way that the
surfaces react to the light I mean it
just feels more tangible more real
moving to gameplay topics in the real
world we have some of our own electronic
worker and
more fair how is that a thought in star
citizen how's it being handled well
we're going to do that so like
definitely on the bigger ships there's
going to be a whole design post that
we're going to release in the near
future they'll come from the foundry 42
folks because they're they're taking
over there basically focusing on the big
ship cap ship combat because that's a
part of squadron 42 and then their work
will also be part of the persistent
universe there's a whole set of games in
terms of running the big ships requiring
multiple people at different stations
communication so yeah you can have all
levels like so you'll have a sort of
electronic warfare you know station for
you know an officer that does that you
know combat air patrol kind of commander
engineering helm so it's gonna be a
whole bunch and there's a lot of stuff
that you can do during like battles and
combats in the bigger ship so in some
ways the big ship combat is almost like
another game so we're going to have the
the fighters stuff that you sort of will
see in the V one of the dogfighting but
the big big sort of combat capital ship
stuff will be a lot of fun too so I'm
kind of looking forward to later on
where we sort of have all that up and
working and hopefully teams of people
will be like one running on the big ship
and then like people running on fighters
and it would be cool we'll see my next
question was going to be about how you
are planning to be multi crew combat
interesting and that sort of covers some
of that oh yeah there you go no it's
gonna be pretty awesome I mean we're
already looking over it's an extension
we've because we sort of went out of our
way we spent a lot of time building
systems so even the fighters or run with
systems like there's no you know like
basically like the radar its own plug-in
system weapons controls and plugin
system the weapons are all their own
plugin systems we have like batteries
that plug-in power plants to plug in
shield generators that plug in the
lights that you see on the vehicle you
see on the Hornet they're actually all
self-aware items too so anyone like the
Hornet itself i think flies around with
about 60 different items plugged into it
so most of the functionality of all the
spaceships comes with the items right so
whether
firing a gun the computers to do it your
avionics the intelligent flight control
they're all items to plug in so what
that means and they're all they all plug
into a system that they share their data
via pipe so we have the basic types one
is a power pipe one is a fuel pipe one
is a data or CPU pipe and one is a heat
pipe and they sort of plug into the
system now the out printed and yeah yeah
so so like you plug a power plant in
right and so it feeds the power plant pi
PI but you plug a weapon in it draws
energy like a laser draws energy from
the power or a light draws energy for
the power plant right so why it's just
like a magical name IPC building and
then what happens is say if the part of
your ship that had the power plant gets
blown off there'll be no power going
into the pipe all the weapons and lights
will go dark because so there's no it's
not like code in there that says oh if
this happens then do this it's basically
they just you know they have their own
real set which is like okay operate I
need this much power to operate if I
have between this motion this which
power on the operate it so much
efficiency below this I can't operate
that's pretty much about how most the
items are set up so it sort of just all
falls out of the system as parts blower
for whatever it will affect your dynamic
so you know and you know the intelligent
flight control system obviously if you
know some of your blast some of your
thrusters are blown off in combat then
you won't be able to correct your
attitude of flight as well so it's a
really nice sort of system based
approach so it's not really custom code
at all and then that extends really well
to the big ships because they use the
same thing it's just that now on one of
those aspects you just have like a whole
station that's dedicated to tweaking and
controlling and and so there'll be extra
things like on a big ship you'll be able
to sort of redirect power when say you
know the left side of your ships being
destroyed you can redirect power away
from the power lines that went there to
the power lines on the right side of the
ship can make sure power gets the
tourists in the back that kind of thing
and that'll be part of the sort of
gameplay done through
aui I guess in the ship command well eat
so there's different this no notice so
you have to there's all different
stations you can sit down in control and
they'll be some level of running around
and having the patch things or plug in a
new fuse or though that kind of stuff so
it should be some pretty cool gameplay
thoughts on espionage well we you know
we I think we talked to the
organization's we're going to have some
level of support for people to do some
level of spying yeah just cuz it's fun
yeah like all those stories you hear
about all the eve stuff haha yeah so so
with figuring out population count in
general for for the game as a whole that
is the plan sort of two I guess there's
a data server everyone to next to it for
the persistent universe yes and then
you're still just dropping players in
and out based on PVE PvP settings well
yeah I mean basically everyone runs on
all the universe of the system server
and then basically the settings in terms
of like who your friends are your
enemies are who your personal interest
is what your ping is whether you want to
be doing pvp or PVE those are all
criteria that go into the matchmaking
that happens at the system server level
that hands you after the different
instance servers and so it basically
just matches up people so basically it's
just sort of in the background dynamic
matching where it's just watching where
you are and saying who's close to you
and do they qualify like someone's close
to you but you know the pings really bad
for instance you know you're in America
and they're in Australia or something
then it's likely not to put you together
unless you said oh I always want to play
with my friend and this is my friend and
then it will put you together but your
experience may not be so great so that's
kind of what happened so a lot of what's
happening in the background is you're
just getting you know as you fly around
in space from your point of view other
people or other NPCs are just sort of
streaming into your local area and in
terms of up
any patches or other modules I should
say that are coming up what should
players be looking forward to and where
should they be going back to check for
more details well Robert space
industries com is the place to go we
will be releasing the dogfight module
pretty soon which will also agreed a
little bit of an upgrade for the hangar
module and then going forward there'll
be some variations of that and hopefully
we're going to be teasing the first
person shooter side of the game later
this year and more detail on that below
we've already got a video of our first
person shooting the elements once again
thank you for all the work time you
opened check all the links check Robert
space industries com and we will see you
all thank you guys for your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
