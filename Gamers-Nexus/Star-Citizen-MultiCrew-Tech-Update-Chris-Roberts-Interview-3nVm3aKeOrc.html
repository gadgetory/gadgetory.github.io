dotnet we're joined again by chris
Roberts I'm cloud imperium games and we
just spoke about that PS module that
should already be on the channel now
we're talking about multi crew and the
the previous roadmap I saw a sort of FPS
module and multi crew were a little bit
after each other multi cruise later
what's what's that looking like in terms
of feature set how complete our things
well we're actively in the multi crew
something will look down right now you
hear where well most all the studios
around the world are working on multi
crew we're going to show sort of the
next generation of it off at Gamescom so
that's in about three weeks time or so
and it's a there's a bunch of stuff
that's really exciting so we you know I
think we've talked before that we moving
the engine over to 64-bit so yeah notnot
like 60 so less about 64-bit compile
more about 64-bit positional space so
pretty much every 3d engine works in
32-bit which is great for a normal FPS
because you usually don't have maps that
are bigger than say I know eight
kilometres by eight kilometres but for
us we've got you know star systems that
are millions of kilometres across in the
position on 32-bit stresses and I know
so we spent about eight months now it's
done moving the engine over to 64-bit
world space coordinates so the last kind
of part of it was moving the rendering
over so it became camera relative
because the GPUs themselves most of them
don't work in significant they work 32
bit but since you generally won't be
able to see millions of kilometres away
you know the visible range is inside 32
bits but the actual overall system
spaces is much bigger and then we'll
have some special handling for big
celestial objects that's something we
just type out in our fury ax review as
well the bit size of the different
interfaces and architectures so it's
definitely a hot topic right now yeah
yeah no no I'm sorry and it took a lot
of work because busy like I said most
engines are sort of built with the two
in 64 bit and back when I think they
were written because you know CryEngine
you know was you know first of all from
Far Cry and the crisis and so on you
know they didn't even think about have a
successful bit so and you know there's
tens of thousands of files so it took a
lot luckily we've had some of the
original engineers and architects of the
engine join us and so they helped a lot
with it so at Gamescom we are going to
be showing a large world map just
actually a small portion of it but if
you were to fly from the starting
location to the ending location would
take you two and a half hours at top
sort of current dogfight speeds you know
I think it's several hundred thousand
kilometres of the distance well of
course do a bit of a quantum jump
between them but it's all on the same
map and the same scale and what's really
nice is we've got that and the second
piece of technology that the engine
group is built which is called the zone
system so one of the big challenges and
this is one of the things we definitely
multi crew is the zone system is what
enables us to handle sort of sparse /
dense data so you know in most FPS games
like I said it's a you know eight by
eight kilometres you know the density of
the levels very consistent you know
you're wandering around you know
buildings or vegetation and there's a
lot of objects and you know interest in
small amounts of areas but in space you
can have huge areas of nothing in and
then you can have areas of high density
like a space station or an asteroid
field or say a big ship that has you
know people inside and stuff like that
so what we needed was a sort of method
of handling this data and calling it and
updating it in organizing in a way that
was up to more because typical way
engines use is like octrees which is not
very good for sort of the sparse data
only occasionally have and and
so we build this thing called the zone
system so essentially you break things
into zones and you get into zones and
the zones could have more and more
fidelity into them so like you can have
a big multi cruise ship itself has it is
considered everything that's attached to
is considered in it so and then inside
there's an interior that its own so now
that ship can exist inside space and
Australian dealer now yeah so it can
exist inside says one's own could be
round a moon right and that moon zone
could be inside the system zone and so
it's ways of sort of container izing
data or you know things that would
render a things your update in a way
that the engine can efficiently decide
because I'm do I need to render it to
anybody and that's tied into a whole
bunch of other things like visibility
culling so it's the only way we get our
really big capital ships and some of our
more you know heavy multi cruise ships
to work properly so like if you play
you're in the hangar one of the reasons
why the hangars you know can run slow if
you have a lot of big ships and
constellations are freelancers is you
know each one of those you know the old
models are like two and a half million
Polly's each you know a good million
half is really on the interior right and
right so do you know the original the
way we're doing originally was very
brute force it just gets thrown all in
the renderer and then it just decides
what's going to call out whereas our
newer system has has that all plugged
into their zones and so it's
intelligently cooling out geometry
objects you don't need to update if you
can't see a or if you're not near their
zone and so that's really what enables
the large you know the promise of star
citizen these huge massive areas but you
have this incredibly high fidelity right
you've got like this you know next-gen
triple a first-person fidelity you can
reach out touch and feel everything use
the toilet whatever yeah it's all there
in a detail you normally don't get wish
you normally only get in sort of a
contained small FPS kind of area but now
we have that in you know that can you
know you can get in and you can walk in
and we're going to show in a gamescon
you're going to start on the space
station you're in a room you'll get out
you'll open up the space into you'll see
this sort of gas ran outside you'll go
out to the landing pad to get into a
Cutlass with your friends and they'll
all get into the colors which all be its
own zone running the local grid which is
this is where we have the fizz
partitioned for each individual ship so
we can fly around you can be moving
around the ship irrelevant of where the
ship's go as hey there are there any
loading screens in between all nope
we're loading no loading screens that's
the other thing is like so the zone
system helps us determine what we stream
so when you know where the zone system
is you know what's contained in the zone
system as you approach it in the
background which streams that's the
other tech we've been doing is
background streaming of the graphics and
background creations remove the entities
some of us a little bit will be at 1.15
because that's one of the reasons how we
got rid of we've got more one of the
issues with more players in arena
commander words and all the ships are
really heavy and so what happens is when
you blow a ship up and you recreate it
just building that ship takes a whole
bunch of time on the main thread and it
creates the stall both on the client
hand on the server and so that's where
you get this lag when you play a match
and you see ship skip and so we've been
working to sort of beat streaming stuff
in the background so even though it's
loading lots of data it's not it's not
stalling the client or the server so
that will reduce lag and there's still a
lot more work to be done for it but it's
all built to be sort of just dynamically
streaming background we need to because
the size of our ships and the detail
mean you know they're huge we're talking
hundreds of megabytes in terms of
textures and geometry and all the rest
of them so at Gamescom we're sort of
demoing the sort of real system that
will sort of enable you know that
promise of the full star citizen
universe's universe where you could you
know walk around in this incredible
fidelity get into your ship take it off
fly somewhere else fly large distances
get out of your ship EV a into another
ship stop that ship up and then fly
around and get to combat with that love
it's and we're all so that's sort of
what we're all focusing on right here
which is sort of our demo of to give you
a taste of arena commander 2 point 0
which is the multi cruise ships our goal
is to hopefully get arena commander the
multi crew stuff out forward as six
weeks after FPS drops we have some
integration to do because FPS is on a
separate code branch right now to the
multi crew stuff so once es is out we
after we've got to drop that back in to
the co branch integrated get it working
again get rid of any conflicts of bugs
of problems and then finish out sort of
multi crew but are a real girl with the
multi crew stuff is you know we're going
to have this huge like one of the play
maps you'll have will be one of these
huge maps and when you're going to sort
of set it up in a free flight mode and
just have places for people to play her
out and see what happens because it's
really going to be some of the
playground for what is universally liked
and from there that's why we're going to
start to basically release parts of
aspects of what will build them sister
Universal because the original intention
of arena commander and also what we do
marine was really they're all sort of
testing grounds for the gameplay and the
features that are part of the a bigger
system which you know Tony and his team
in Austin supported by other areas like
behavior and the folks in Germany is
building some of this bigger persistent
universe experience so I'm really pretty
excited by where we're at with wanting
to I think hopefully people will be
impressed by what they see won't show of
games karna mean it's it's it's a real
system that has extensibility and we're
going to show you transitioning you know
you're getting into one ship taking our
flying getting being across into another
ship powering an hour from flying just
all those things that you've seen in the
match enema videos that people have done
that you go okay I could do that in a
game will be awesome so i'm i'm i'm
super excited because a lot of the
technology would be spending a lot of
time working on but you know you really
can't show because it's you know deep
down in the bowels of the engine is now
coming to fruition right and we're
getting it in and we're actually getting
in to show you know what it will allow
you to do and of course yes there's
going to be bugs and issues and edge
cases but the potential of that you know
you just haven't had the ability to ever
do this and again before and i think
that will be a new experience so people
get to play it like I the way I sort of
you and what happens on our stuff is
there and this happened last year is
that now we've got an incredible group
of supporters and backers are allowing
us to make this super ambitious game
though I think no publisher would ever
back and buy in general they're pretty
patient but you know you at some point
yeah when they don't feel like they're
going a new content they get a bit rowdy
and so last year you know you know we
hadn't had to Rena commander out and we
thought we were going to have it out
sort of closer to sort of March April
the game like a star Murray and it was
getting pretty rowdy on the forums and
then we dropped V 0.8 of arena commander
and then know the rest of the year you
know it sort of went pretty well I mean
I'm not saying everything was perfect
but you know he dropped out p 0.91 point
no and you know people got new ships and
play stuff and we they could see there
was visible changes and alterations and
the gameplay maybe not everything that
everyone wants the way they wanted it
but you know they definitely could see
that we were working on and changing
things and responding to what people
were saying and so that you know kind of
went and then you know on the arena
commander side we stopped updating it I
think I've covered when our last patch
was out maybe a brother may at the time
I think it was shortly after pack sees
what happened was we thought FPS would
be earlier and we didn't want to
overload the QA guys and you know at the
time we would look like the FPS patch
potentially could drop five weeks after
the most recent right arena commander
patch like yeah you know normally we
like a two to three-week cadence but now
let's push it so we don't make it too
much work for anyone and then of course
FPS 21 Romano he never went back and
updated a arena commander and fix some
of the balance things or adding new
ships and so no one's seen any progress
on a reader commander for like three
months and so this point I think people
exciting rowdy and I like I want to be
doing something in there's only so much
you can dogfight with its own set of
ships without changes and so would
that's one reason why we're putting 1.15
out there because it will have the mill
in which is a smaller fighter and it
will have the side there'll be flyable
so the people the few people that have a
side can fly around in you also have the
ability to get that with Iraq which
would be fun and get people playing
again and then hopefully start
stammering will be pretty soon after
that and then
multi crew and then we're going to have
some sister unit so mal seizure is still
after star Marines yes after summer yeah
it's definitely up some right now it's
it's the the multi crew for us is our
whole process is its star marine will be
so we have 1.15 then we'll probably have
1.16 which is sort of an incremental
improvement on 1.15 which will be about
two weeks after 1.16 and that plan of
that is to go to actually go live with
that apps games con and then have star
marine which is 1.2 oh because it's all
on the same codebase roundabout games
con on the PTU or slightly after the
game's conscious depending on where we
am at it and then after you're on the
pdu usually it's a few weeks on the PTU
and then you should go live and i hope
that would be the case of i don't know
that it on the PT we may expose some
things that we haven't done before
that's one of the cases where like our
internal QA you know we've got maybe 30
people around the company in QA which is
not small yeah but when you're trying to
do a multiplayer game it's really not
much so you first go to the pdu or we go
like that's when we get real testing so
that will go and then after the FPS
drops multi crew would would come after
that so tentatively you know I would say
if you're looking at it you know i would
think that multi crew potentially is a
citizen khan release so but you know
again don't want to do it share MSL yeah
but it's going to be very cool I mean
it's going to be and I'm and I'm super
excited because we're also having
working on the different roles for you
know the copilot and the pilots so it's
not just the gunner and no there'll be a
lot more stuff going around like the
engineer and all the rest so it will be
people playing co-op operating the same
ship together and and I actually think
it's one of the things that will make a
big difference because right now
everyone sort of judges sort of the
space combat flight experience in the
microcosm of single seater ships flying
around and single seater ships it's one
thing but we've got these big multi
cruise ships and then one of these huge
capital ships and so we have to have
control schemes and systems that handle
every
and so it's pretty hard to sort of like
really judge where everything sits until
you get them all in you know like is
this really overpowered or not
overpowered or how does this ship sit in
the overall scranton things because you
know there's a lot more gameplay that
we're planning on than just single
seater dogfight combat so I'm really
excited to get multi crew in there
because it sort of opens up the palette
there'll be things for people to do that
won't just be straight about combat and
i'll also be able to sort of see some
interesting stuff we're like now we'll
probably put some things in like a
mission where you've got to escort the
ship to get from point A to point B is a
test which will be sort of a prototype
of a cystic universe tight mission and
you know then you'll have people
cooperatively some people playing the
big ship some people in escort and other
people trying to take it out and that'll
be this whole sort of cooperative
gameplay that I think is one of the true
promises as well yeah so there's multi
crew brings us beyond that previous
video as the FPS and check out of course
Robert space industries for the the game
and then gamertag just an app for
updates and receive will see you all
next time yeah thanks alright see you
