episode and as always comments in the
questions below questions in the
comments below if you have questions
we'll try and address them the next
episode so this is where we address your
questions and sort of a QA before
getting to the questions this episode is
brought to you by iBUYPOWER
and the new elements gain PC with the
full side window that is all time for
class LEDs and it's basically modified
s340 case so I first off before getting
to other questions I wanted to talk
about this this is a unit we just got in
this is a sine ology Nass I think it's a
DES 1515 plus and so we loaded this up
because we've been having some pretty
serious data management issues with all
of our videos to give you an idea we've
been burning through because of the
video photo test data article image
website management all that stuff we've
been burning through about a hundred
gigabytes of data per week it's on a hat
because it's not plugged into an
Ethernet cable so this is an ass and
speaking of Ethernet cables that is how
it works it's got I think four ports on
this particular model so I could plug in
two Ethernet and basically we pipe yes
four ports so we pipe that in to our
local gigabit switch we just use sort of
a generic gigabit switch have a couple
of them for the different test setups
and then all the data can feed through
to all the PCs so the cool thing is that
I wanted to talk out with this is we've
now set up our multiple test benches the
laptops that are under test the
production systems the render machine
all that stuff talks to this it's all
separated I've even started doing
permissions and things like that so that
users who are only accessing testing
data will only see that data to reduce
confusion so it's helping a lot give you
an idea of what this is it's a 20
terabyte set up we've got it in RAID
with all of these populated so five
disks they are Seagate disks I'm not
sure how they're nasty discs perform yet
this is the first time I've used them
I've not had great luck with some
Seagate stuff in the past but so far
seems okay
and it isn't raid I've got it set up in
a raid 5 set up so that means one day
is effectively a parody disc so if we
have one failure pull it out put another
one in
and then we'll be good to go so that's
the sort of what we've been working on
lately cool technology I've had a lot of
fun with the backend managing it we
obviously don't really sort of review
this stuff generally but I will probably
be publishing some test data on it just
to show the improvement from our
existing three disc raid 5 setup on the
local render machine to the 5 disc raid
5 setup with complete remote access it's
got a web interface so pretty cool stuff
but that is the NASS we've been using so
that's where you've seen all the videos
on because we're burning again almost
half a terabyte per month in video
content thanks to the high demand for
video content so thank you for watching
questions first one is from spork hit
six five five who says hey Steve I
understand that there's no way of
knowing this for sure but how long do
you estimate Sandy Bridge CPUs like the
39 60 X I was a good CPU 3930k 2700 K
2600 k so we got sandy bridge-e and
Sandy Bridge how long do you think
they'll be relevant for high end gaming
pcs know particularly calling out of GT
X 1080 so you are correct I do not have
a good way of knowing 100% for sure but
I do know that some of these TVs evlist
like the 39 60 X especially still
perfectly fine that's a good chip it was
an extreme street chip 3930k also a good
chip 2600 definitely is getting a bit
aged I'm sure it's long on the tooth for
some more CPU bound games but you do
need to run into those games obviously
it's a really experience an issue the
interesting thing is with new API is
they're not they're not really hitting
the market as quickly as you would want
for Sandy Bridge but going forward the
new api's will aid those older CPUs in
terms of managing load so as we've
discussed before as many of you all know
at this point draw calls obviously this
sort of one really go to that everyone
talks about the draw calls are being
moved more heavy
two GPUs they don't have to sort of
correspond with the CPU for every single
draw call anymore with dx12 and Vulcan
if the game is built ground up for those
API so other words just a wrapper and it
has to do all the work plus the rafts
overhead but so that's one point that
works for you for these older CPUs
that's a good thing in terms of the the
sort of more realistic immediate future
and present where we're still on dx11
for almost everything and in some very
rare cases OpenGL you will definitely
start seeing limitations in a few CPU
bound games one example total war
Warhammer it's not a GPU bound game so
if you throw a gtx 1080 in there with a
2600 k you will definitely see
throttling versus something like a 6700
K that's the fact
now how much start throttling will it be
relevant to you it depends sort of on
what settings you demand what the rest
of your setup is in terms of graphics
options resolution of the monitor multi
monitor all that stuff but a lot of the
options for those types of games will
impact the CPU heavily and that is
something we see with Total War but it's
dx12 enabled at least for testing so
that is a positive as well so the hard
answer no I do not know if I had to
estimate there's a wide range of CPUs
the 39 60 X if I had in my system I
would still personally be using it
because that's perfectly fine even for
rendering tasks if you're not doing it
every single day
a 2600 K let's look at that one that was
a really popular CPU and we'll
definitely age out the fastest but I
mean I probably wouldn't want to pair it
with a 1080 but if you're in a situation
where you want to buy a 1080 today or
whatever equivalent card and then
upgrade CPUs maybe with KB Lake I would
be ok with that I probably wouldn't want
to pair it with a 2600 K for long term
though just because it does definitely
impact performance in some CPU games but
depends on the games you're playing so
that's where the the lon answer to that
I know it's not the direct answer we
really
can't give you one because obviously I
only have so much future site next
question is from very real Americans who
says hi gamers Nexus love the channel
thank you
quick question I'm upgrading for my 2600
K okay so we've got another one - a 6700
K this means I need to get a new
motherboard that is correct am I good
just plugging in my old SSD with all my
stuff on it
- my new board and boots the same OS do
I need a complete new install depends on
your OS Linux is very friendly with
switching operating systems generally in
my experience Ubuntu I've never really
had I said switching operating systems I
meant switching platforms Ubuntu I've
never had an issue say moving from an
AMD system to an Intel system windows
I've had lots of issues and many other
people have - so with Windows depending
on what you're using some Windows
versions will attach themselves to like
CPU motherboard platform things like
that in those instances it will be very
unhappy with a move older versions of
windows especially Windows 7 has had
issues I know Windows 8 has had some
issues those older versions especially
as you migrate from very different
architectures one to the next that is
when you'll see the biggest impact and
it could be a few things it could be you
know immediately because you blue screen
can't boot or it says no operating
system detected or something like that
so that's obviously a failure you can't
work around that
another potential issue well you could
try work around it but it's really not
worth it
another potential issue is it looks like
it works but there's some performance
loss because who knows what's going on
under the hood and the one of the
reasons for a lot of that stuff is
because you've got all these old drivers
that are just embedded in the system
chipset drivers all the graphics audio
all that stuff and it's more than that -
because every single USB device you've
ever used goes into the system and is
logged somewhere every GPU Ram CPU all
that stuff it knows what all those
devices are Windows builds itself around
talking to them especially older
versions so it doesn't do well with
migration you can certainly clean it up
but unless you very much need
keep that OS I would recommend a clean
install and just in the future partition
everything in a way that you can keep
all your documents images all that stuff
isolated and just blast the OS whenever
you need to change it Windows 10 I've
had pretty good luck with changing but
again when you change platforms you
definitely can see some variants and
even framerate moving from one platform
to the next you really need to be throw
with driver cleaning but it does depend
on the OS next question is oh well I
guess to sort of direct the answer 2600
K to 6700 K try it if it looks like it's
performing poorly before maybe the
migration before you migrate try and do
a quick benchmark so you know your
baseline test it again with the new
platform if it looks bad it's not
booting then just be prepared to wipe it
the next question is from Oberst Oberst
who says do you know what's an
acceptable max temperature for VR M's if
you're talking about motherboard VR MZ v
RM it depends as always on the
components the MOSFETs everything they
use in their cooling but generally they
can get pretty damn hot so they they
have a much greater range of temperature
tolerance than something like a GPU or a
CPU or you might kind of hit limits on
90c with most VR Em's most very blanket
there you'll be okay a hundred degrees
plus what's acceptable is maybe
different from what's the maxim max some
VRMs we've worked with recently you can
go up to 125 C would you want to do that
absolutely not
but they will still function they lose
efficiency as they heat up of course and
obviously they can heat up neighboring
components which you don't necessarily
want but you can definitely go up there
so if you see a hundred degrees C I
would try to do something to work on
that maybe another fan or something if
it's a motherboard setup where if you
have top exhaust get rid of that because
in a lot of cases not all but a lot of
cases we've found that's bad for vrm and
for cpu cooling if you use in a tower
cooler try and do something about it but
100 C for a vrm is not something that it
can't handle probably don't want to run
it long-term 24/7 up times but it's not
something that system can't tolerate
otherwise it would turn itself off but
so that's kind of a overview of that if
you want more information on vrm
temperature I am certainly not afraid to
point you toward absolutely or apps hey
actually hardcore overclocked and sorry
a hack I have screwed up your name like
four times in a row actually hardcore
overclocking is the channel searching on
YouTube he does a lot of in-depth stuff
with that and that'll answer some of
these questions very specifically for
specific video cards next question
big man 700 says I have a possibly dumb
question what is the highest temperature
Celsius that you would want your CPU to
run went under 100 some blows definitely
not a dumb question so the highest
temperature is Celsius you would want to
run when under 100% load it depends a
bit on the CPU but generally they are
all kind of t.j.maxx about 100 to see
about plus -5 normally some some are
lower like non-case TVs are a lot lower
but generally that's kind of the max of
your average case Q CPU from Intel or
AMD even and that's the temperature at
which there will be a thermal shutdown
if it can't throttle itself to control
the temperatures so what happens is as
you approach that maximum the CPU will
start backing off of the clock rate and
comets frequency and try and lower
temperatures so in those instances
you'll see framerate output drops the
average output over time will drop but
it's because it's trying to control the
temperature so you do have protections
there but in terms of the the maximum
that you would definitely want to stay
ideally under a point where the CPU is
throttling because you obviously don't
want to lose performance there's a
reason as kind of Dom as heat as opposed
to like a hardware reason or voltage
reason but for for my CPUs if I'm
running air and we're just talking an
actual diode temperature value not a
delta value I would probably be looking
at I try to keep them less than 80
that's not always possible it does
depend if it's an FX 9000 series CPU
that's a lot harder if it's an extreme
series Intel CPU Broadwell Eve that's a
lot harder
they are higher wattage chips so they
generate a lot more heat but that's kind
of where I like to stick around is ADC
for air if I can do it if I'm on liquid
it depends a lot on the cooler the sort
of cheap 550 LC ace tech coolers 120
millimeter coolers they really can't do
a lot for extreme series chips we on a
render rig hit 70 something Celsius
that's with liquid that's not ideal I
will be replacing that soon with a
better radiator and cooler but with
liquid I would like to target sort of
the 50s South seus non Delta value so
hopefully that kind of answers that
question that is very general that is
all my personal preference so your
mileage may vary but that's kind of what
I look for when I'm fine-tuning my
systems if you can get it lower great
but it is hard because 100 percent load
generates a lot of heat any modern CPU
for the most part the next question last
question is from Thomas who says CV
cooler orientation is horizontal
parallel with the GPU worse for thermals
than the usual vertical positioning I
have case fans both the top and the back
so this is another depends I'll give you
a few scenarios where things do matter
we've tested this with the Manta and
with the 400 C where fans are in
different positions in the case and
those lives is the recent ones I've also
done that Cabaye calif or kilo 5 we've
done the half x ages ago lots of cases
generally with a fan in the top and even
ignoring the CPU cooler orientation fan
the top as exhaust you do potentially
eat air away almost like you're
suffocating the CPU fan you're pulling
air away from that fan depending on
where it's positioned so in some cases
like the KL o 4 I've actually seen
improved performance by doing intake on
the top which is not something you sort
of normally think about not ideal for
dust management but better performance
or no fans on the top and I've gotten
better performance that's not true for
every case there are certainly cases
where it's better to have top exhaust
that depends on how they're built the
air channels your tower cooler you're
using all that stuff matters but the
question here specifically parallel with
the GP amount
so that's where you've got I guess
you're asking video cards like this
slotted into the case and then you've
got a cooler here and the air is going
that way out the back in that scenario
no it is not worse for thermals
generally but that's mainly because your
alternative is to turn to rotate it and
point it down at the GPU so either
you're pulling air in the top of the
cooler and pushing it down through into
the back of the card which will heat up
the card potentially not in a way that
matters but it depends how hot your CPU
is or you're trying to pull air in and
up and out the top which now your
thermals will be pretty bad because
you've got the card restricting your air
air flow through a tiny channel and the
back of the card generates heat by the
way and we've measured this and tests
with the Manta and the 400 see the card
generates heat it'll radiate maybe one
or two degrees not a lot but it will
certainly radiate heat and warm up your
CPU temperature because you are losing
dissipation ability of the rest of the
CPU heatsink because you're just sucking
in warmer air so I would position it the
way that you're saying I would position
it to shoot out the back if it's at our
cooler not position it towards the GPU
if avoidable but as far as fan
orientation do as much intake in the
front and bottom as you can side intake
is great for GPU temperatures not every
case does it and I would avoid doing too
complex to set up in the top of your
average case to pan your case because
that is where it starts starts getting
fuzzy as to if there's an actual benefit
or if it's even hindering the cooling so
that is all for this episode as always
