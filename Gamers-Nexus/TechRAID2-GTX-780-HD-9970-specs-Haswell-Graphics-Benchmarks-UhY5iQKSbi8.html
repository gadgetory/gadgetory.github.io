nexus dotnet and we are back for an
episode of tech raid where i will recap
all the major gaming hardware news
that's come out in the last month or so
and this week alone actually has been a
pretty big deal we had photos of
nvidia's gtx 770 week AMD confirmed a
roadmap to their next iteration of GPUs
as well of course is rapidly approaching
and on the motherboard front gigabyte
has a pretty cool new high res
customizable UEFI BIOS for their
impending Haswell boards so all that in
mind let's start with the graphics news
in recent leaks to chip hell photos of
Nvidia's reference GTX 770 have surfaced
along with speculation of course on
prices and some specification
information fed Zilla has also cited
sources on card specs but has some
conflicting information with chip health
so I'll just lay it out straight for you
since there's really no way to know who
is more accurate between the two weeks
and two sources first of all both sites
and both sources confirm that the 700
series of geforce GPUs will effectively
be rebranded 600 series chips just
stepped up by a tier so the gtx 770 will
more or less represent a gtx 680 of the
previous line of of kepler which the 700
series also runs on the gtx 760 ti will
effectively be a gtx 670 and so on we'll
see the same gk104 GPUs on the 770 and
760 TI as we saw on the respective
predecessors though the gtx 780 is
significantly more interesting the 780
looks like a it looks more like what
we'd call a Titan light card so of
course everyone knows the GTX Titan by
now and from what chip held sources have
stated it looks like the gtx 780 will
utilize the same gk110 or at least a
slightly stripped-down version of the
gk110 GPU that's found in the titan
it'll have 24 96 cuda cores to Titans
2688 so in terms of raw compute power
they're really not all that far apart at
least for our game
and enthusiasts purposes it's almost
definitely less optimized for
professional applications of course but
that's just how optimization works it
will still be targeted toward gaming for
the 780 the 780 will ship in both 3
gigabyte and 5 gigabytes Q's gddr5 from
what we've heard and according again to
chip hell both 3 gigabyte and 5
gigabytes Q's will have 320 bit and
384-bit memory interfaces respectively
fazila on the other hand says the 780
will be on a 256-bit memory interface
based on the titan le gk110 chip really
that's a pretty massive difference for
the memory interface between the two
reports and it is a very significant
impact for gaming purposes actually any
purposes because you need enough
bandwidth which is partially calculated
by the interface with so you can
actually push the data to all of that
ram as for what i can tell you well this
isn't a new generation of g-force chips
it's not the max well jan we've been
waiting for and it's effectively a
rebrand and slight upgrade of the
existing options i don't want to make it
sound bad because it's not they will
probably perform pretty well but it's
not Maxwell just FYI the new units will
have revised heatsinks that are similar
to the titan cooler so that's certainly
reason to be excited and i'd imagine we
might have better overclocking potential
with the shift of boost to point out
down from titan to the consumer class
700 series if nothing else boost to
point 0 will be a big boon to the
adoption of whatever cards end up
carrying them by enthusiasts
overclockers when we attended PAX East
our Nvidia sources somewhat ambiguously
noted that boost to point out would be
shifting down the chain to new chips as
for whether new chips are clarified as
the 700 drop or Maxwell I'm not certain
that information may be out there so
certainly do comment below if you find
it generally another upgrade that
happens with these quote-unquote
rebrands as I've been calling it is a
drop in TDP and heat overall so that's
another thing to definitely look out for
and it's not as big a deal as with the
Fermi series but certainly always a good
thing to drop heat will still be running
on Kepler architecture and while I'm
certain that the gtx
gains over the GTX honored equivalently
branded cards anyone who's already on
Kepler or Fermi may want to wait it out
another generation or at least wait for
some of the more in-depth benchmarks to
emerge the ship dates on the 700 series
have been listed as May twenty-third for
the 780 with a potential May sixteenth
drop May thirtieth for the 770 and
quote-unquote summer for the 760 Ti so
moving on to amd's GPU updates we get a
somewhat less exciting but equally
noteworthy roadmap and AMD's sea islands
GPS were originally due out in quarter
to this year for those who remember but
due to a series of delays and
technological hurdles we may not see
them until quarter 3 or quarter for if
at all there's technically already been
an 8000 series drop in the form of OEM
chips for laptops and other devices but
no official 8000 series sea islands
cards have yet been put out the new
richland apu which is due fairly soon
and will champion trinity will
technically be running 8000 series
branded you know an internal apu the GPU
component of that but they're mostly
just rehashes of the 6000 series found
in trinity as the base so in short
there's been no major news on the 8000
front and due to delays and branding and
marketing reasons I almost wonder if
we'll even ever see one though if we do
see an 8000 drop in consumer GPUs it
won't be until much later this year what
we do know however is that AMD has now
confirmed some of the specs of their HD
9970 chip in the volcanic island series
of GPUs volcanic islands originally due
out after sea islands and the 9970 has
been stated to operate on 20 nanometer
gate last manufacturing process which is
actually ahead of schedule so that
should probably happen and it aims to
take place of Tahiti the 9970 boasts
4096 stream processors 256 TM use 64
ROPS and a massive 512 bit memory
interface according to our sources with
that large of an interface I wouldn't be
surprised to see an unprecedented memory
capacity to take advantage
of the increased memory bandwidth and
bus and given AMD's 8 gigabyte unified
memory presence on the ps4 I don't think
it's too ridiculous to suspect that they
may take a similarly high-capacity
approach to discrete GPUs in the desktop
market transitioning from GPUs and two
CPUs feels a lot more natural in the
modern era of I GPS and AP US then
really it ever has before and Intel's
Haswell chips have had a series of final
confirmations lately including ship
dates specs pricing and igp info it's
too complex to delve into great depth
here but we can definitely go over some
of the basics and need to know info as
for the graphics component which intel
pushes really heavily lately Intel's
released internal benchmarks so these
haven't been checked by third parties
might do of benchmarks of haswell's iris
integrated graphics the results were
compiled only with Intel's 3rd gen Ivy
Bridge HD 4000 igp on the desktop side
versus its 4th gen iris IGP on 3dmark11
but they're still pretty promising from
the charts we've seen it looks like
Intel's desktop class I 7 4770k
outperforms the current gen i7 3770k
strictly in graphics output by nearly
three hundred percent so three times
faster however they define faster I
think it's actually defined by the score
granted by 3dmark11 and they they
normalize that score to just an easy 3x
despite the TDP increase 284 wats in the
4770k from I think was 77 wats
previously that's a pretty insane amount
of graphics power to pack into a
socketed CPU which traditionally has
only been the CPU up until the last
couple years here is it something that I
want to game on not really if I'm honest
most enthusiast gamers will still want a
discrete card and Intel knows that
they're not trying to compete with you
know high-end Nvidia chips or AMD cards
that stated it would be closed-minded to
scoff at the incredible developments
made by really AMD intel nvidia everyone
in recent years to bring low TDP high
performance graphics to traditional cpus
that's it's pretty impressive really
when you look at the history of these
cpus and looking at mobile
it's which is where integrated graphics
make a whole lot more sense it actually
looks like Intel's i7 46-50 you CPU
outperforms the previous 3687 you by
approximately 1.5 times the previous
metrics the i7 4558 you is a full two
and a quarter times the score of the
third generation 3687 you so the
mid-range 4650 you has well chip uses
only 1.5 or sorry it uses only 15 watts
1.5 would be pretty outrageous it uses
15 watts so to produce effectively the
same performance as a GT 620m at which
consumes around 35 watts that's that's
pretty impressive I'm I'm excited about
the future of where this is going
keeping thermals and power consumption
down in in the laptop means more
efficient cooling design longer battery
life really just more consolidated in
terms of the actual laptop size and it
yields the same or better performance
than the previous generations so
definitely good news there for laptops
if you are using intel in them as for
when it's coming out we know has wells
targeted release date is june third
witch is dead center of computex i think
we're right before it and this was
confirmed directly by Intel's Twitter
feed which stated the 4th gen release
day 10 nanoseconds from the tweet
pricing will be pretty similar to what
we saw at the launch of the third
generation of CPUs don't expect prices
to fluctuate very much in the Ivy Bridge
market Intel's processors really always
stay around the same price point for
their entire shelf life aside from
occasional fire sales from retailers
transitioning over to motherboards for
the last part of our news for the month
we see gigabyte really getting behind
UEFI BIOS customization and I actually I
recently wrote a roundup article on the
major z87 boards coming out for haswell
but at the time we hadn't yet heard
anything about bio specifically gigabyte
has streamlined their new bios a bit by
stripping out some of the tediously
low-down status menus so they have
instead repositioned them to be more
consistently locate
on the sides and top and bottom of the
screen which allows the user to monitor
CPU memory and system information
constantly without the need to dive
through multiple sub menus and a
screenshot released by gigabyte we also
see what looks to be a user customizable
tab configurator from the image users
will be able to create their own tab
named it assign a location in the menu
hierarchy and then assign items that
will be displayed on that tab probably
most noteworthy however is the fact that
it's a high-res interface likely 1080p
or thereabouts-- and the resolution is
configurable from within BIOS it also
appears that a voltage regulation clock
speeds stuff like that can be
manipulated with slider options which is
kind of neat if a bit unnecessary and
that's all for this month's hardware
roundup if you spotted any important
news that I've left out of here please
post it in a comment below let everyone
know and I will see you all next time
