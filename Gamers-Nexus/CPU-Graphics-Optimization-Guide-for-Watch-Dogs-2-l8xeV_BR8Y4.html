individual graphics settings and how
they affect FPS when restricted by the
CPU whether you play it or not watch

opportunity to learn about the impact of
TV performance caused by graphics
options while stocks - is proven to be
both CPU and GPU intensive and is
exciting strictly because it's one of
the few titles where we're seeing real
performance differences between 8 thread

content peace revitalizes our graphics
optimization guides and this time for
the first time ever in our testing
history is specifically an optimization
guide for CPUs so even if you don't play
watchdogs - this is still a good
opportunity to learn about what types of
graphics settings in a game impact CPU
performance when your bottleneck on the
CPU so for this testing we're obviously
trying to isolate the CPU as the choke
point and that means we're using a gtx
1080 FTW and we've stepped down the cpu
a class - an i-5 6600 K which usually
you wouldn't expect much of a bottleneck
to come out of a 6600 K but for this
game spits well I should say with a big
disclaimer there unless you're trying to
hit 144 120 Hertz then it matters a lot
but normally 60fps stuff like that not a
huge deal with this game watchdogs who
really leverages the i7 CP is we see big
performance gains by going to an i7 more
so than just generationally moving
between i-5 I've shown in our i5 2500 K
revisit so we're using the 6600 K to
create a bottleneck and we found a few
settings that are cpu dependent looking
through the game's graphics options we
can use some basic deduction to make
immediate assumptions as to what might
matter most for the CPU by understanding
basic concepts of the graphics pipeline
we know for instance that geometry is
most likely to involve the CPU heavily
and we also know that extra details will
likely hurt
CP performance as the setting improves
geometric complexity mesh detail things
like that meanwhile options like
anti-aliasing and reflections are
largely computed on the GPU side so we
don't care about those with this and we
know from experience and the basic
understanding again of the pipeline that
these shouldn't have any real impact on
people's performance for test
methodology there are a lot of really
specific things that we did for this so
it's all in the article links of
description below that was written by
Patrick Layton he did the testing for
this particular benchmark and he's got a
guide of how to change the settings
things like that we'll go through here
but the methodology is all in the
article so check that out we also have
side by side screenshots for comparison
between different graphics options but
of course YouTube compresses things so
you might not be able to see the
differences as well as in the article
where we'll have some full resolution
higher quality images to work with let's
start with the presets all totaled again
running with just be 16 600 K and 1080
FTW we're generally able to force a CV
bottleneck except under extreme
condition this first chart shows the
performance of strictly the presets even
with low settings we're not coming close
to the 7700 K is 114 FPS average when
it's on the high settings that's big
difference there the extra four threads
go a long way this scaling shows CPU
limitations for the most part as the
7700 K allows for frame rates exceeding
100 FPS with 1080p high the one
exception is mac settings which enables
that hfts and 100% extra detail that
combination means we're introducing
somewhat of a GPU bottleneck as well but
the other options are primarily seeking
you down unfortunately the presets are a
one-size-fits-all model and with this
game if you're bottlenecking on a CPU
because ni5 not quite enough to get full
performance you could do some manual
tuning to get a mix of ultra high and
medium settings that still looks pretty
good high is the lowest Cree set that
doesn't sacrifice serious graphical
quality with watchdog's
- and there's an obvious difference in
every texture between the high-end
medium reflections of texture resolution
and geometry all get tossed out the
window once you're below High Flow is an
excellent example of why this guide is
necessary the shadows are jagged
textures are blurry even directly next
to the player and everything appears
flat and monochromatic so we can improve
by doing individual settings tuning
extra detail starts us off we've got
screenshots that show details scaling
from zero to 100% extra details again
these are in the article if you want to
study extra detail has the biggest
performance impact and Ubisoft disables
extra details and all of the graphics
presets which demonstrates that they
know this is an issue here's the chart
at the highest setting that decreased
our frame rates by an impressive twenty
four point eight percent when using
extra details enabled we're following up
from eighty-three FPS average to 62 FPS
average and you could extrapolate that
fifty percent extra detail likely plants
you right in the middle that'd be in the
70s for this particular set up extra
detail controls at the level of
geometric complexity on all objects even
ones in the distance which would
normally be replaced with simple easy to
render shapes the most visible changes
in our screenshots anyway are the
distance at which the bus lettering
appears in the center lane of the road
alongside more detailed buildings and
shipping containers and things like that
you can also see the cell phone tower in
the background has some extra geometry
in it and that's really kind of
impressive considering how far away it
is most improvements are barely
noticeable at the street level like
additional support struts on the solar
panel to the left and the cell phone
tower in the center you just don't see
that detail come through when you're
actually on the ground rather than
overlooking everything we'd recommend
that even with setting completely off
and realign instead on the geometry
setting which has a similar effect on
building facades and draw distances but
isn't nearly as abusive this next chart
shows the geometry setting tuning
geometry is set to high in our baseline
benchmark giving us room to turn it down
to medium or low low offered us a five
point eight ish percent increase in
performance over baseline and Ultra
offered about a 10% decrease big change
there this shows that geometry is
another cpu-bound setting the difference
between low and ultra geometry is much
more visible than the difference between
zero and 100% extra detail so again this
is where you want to look for that
tuning 1080p with extra detail amp to
100% and 1080p with Ultra geometry and
zero percent extra detail appears it
virtually identical but the extra detail
version performs far worse so again if
you need more proof geometry is the way
to go if you're wondering why geometry
has such an impact on CPU performance
it's because it's largely a matter
draw calls to see if you must hand off
each primitive and Poli individually to
the GPU and that bogs down the render
pipeline in an early stage of the
processing for each frame with DirectX
11 this is a bigger issue though DirectX
12 hasn't really shown too much promise
yet because developers are still
learning how to implement it the next
few tests all show much smaller impact
on the CPU as the more GPU limited
conditions that watchdogs to as three
reflection settings and including water
and all of these should be handled by
the GPU for the most part the water
setting effect water reflections are not
physics so again that means it's really
a negligible impact on the CPU high or
possibly ultra reflections we think are
a must with any decent GPU as they
dramatically improve the appearance of
vehicles and windows and if you have a
decent GPU on your CPUs kind of week
this is a place where you could turn up
the settings maybe even to ultra and not
really lose any performance terrain
settings were initially promising as a
CPU limited option but we found through
testing that it only controls the
textures of different terrain and Notley
terrain geometry at least not visibly we
didn't notice any significant visual
changes and it's unlikely that this
setting will improve much of anything
outside of potential vram consumption
vegetation controls the rendered
distance of more detailed trees which
are confusingly also affected by the
extra detail setting so that kind of
does impact everything vegetation didn't
have any significant impact within the
bounds of our benchmark course which
contains a reasonable number of trees
but it didn't have a visual impact
overall the setting should be left at
least on high unless performance is
specifically dropping in forested areas
so we've got a limited selection of CPU
binding options in watch dogs too but
this sets the stage for learning more
about when you can afford the tuned
specific settings like geometry rather
than other settings like reflections
because again let's say you're running
on kind of a mixed setup like we have a
GTX 1080 or something like that some
powerful GPU and an i-5 60 600 K maybe
not the most common set up but if you
have something like that close to it
anyway then what you can see is that
with the 6600 K there's this weird
bottleneck that we can get an extra bit
of performance out of the 1080 even if
you open a GP monitoring tool
gtz you'll see that there's room for the
1080 to continue operating and pump out
higher settings quality but the CP
limits us so what you could do in that
scenario is again tune down things like
geometry turn off extra detail because
that's a cpu thing tuned down geometry
and then increase things like
reflections all with the ultra if you
wanted to text your detail increase that
to ultra as well because they're not
going to hit the CPU that much so your
options would more or less look like
ultra ultra ultra all the way down
except for maybe geometry which you have
on medium or something like that or high
depending on how how you want your frame
rate to be so that's all for this video
if you want to fund more things like
this as always a patreon link in the
post roll video you can go to
patreon.com/crashcourse maxis we have
some goals there that are a few have
been reached but some more coming up and
with that funding we can do more of this
testing and do individual graphics
research for games I think the next plan
is to do something let's overwatch so
stay tuned for that subscribe for more

you all next time
