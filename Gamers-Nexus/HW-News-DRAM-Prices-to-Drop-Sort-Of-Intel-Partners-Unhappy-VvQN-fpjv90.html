the past week and most of it has been
Intel but there's been some AMD news as
well there's there's a lot of industry
news in general right now so we've got
of course principled technologies that
we've already discussed at this point
but just to recap it briefly we'll be
going over that again AIB partners
attempting to sidestep tariffs that we
talked about previously
AMD looking to potentially regain 30% CB
market share in fourth quarter of 2018
and then there's also just general news
about DRAM prices 9900 K Z 399 and
things of that sort before that this
video is brought to you by EVGA SRT X 20
atti XE ultra video card we recently
used this to beat our founders edition
overclocking results with its additional
power target headroom and cooling
capabilities the X Z ultra uses a 2.7
extra thick heatsink for quiet operation
under low loads but also maintains
higher clocks on average over the FE
model learn more at the link in the
description below it's a quick update on
our principle technologies news item the
company emailed us notes for
clarification after the interview where
we got some additional answers and this
was after they consulted their technical
staff who worked on testing the GPU
model used if you're curious was the
gigabyte ARS 1080i and we have a
specific model number for that linked in
the article in the description below
we have full article for follow up
interview information from this
discussion with Pt number of test
benches they ended up using 16 so it was
8 duplicated PT's responds to unfair
cooler arrangement was as follows only
the 2700 X came with a cooler the rest
required a cooler to be added and he
certainly did not seem to think they're
cooler was inadequate so it seemed a
reasonable choice of course our argument
is what we disagree with this still as
an independent test outlet PT really
shouldn't be taking Andy's word for much
of anything especially because it
doesn't matter anyway she should be
equalizing all variables and the CPU
cooler is one of those it's a suffocated
case it's it we still think it's not
good testing to use an AMD stock cooler
versus a bunch of Noctua coolers on the
intel products even if AMD thinks it's
good enough you might not be getting
full boost so we disagree with that that
answer but they did at least provide on
memory selection
64 gigabyte questions base and you can
check the interview for those
specifically but they stated we chose
coarser memory due to past experience
with being very reliable
we chose the specific model to be able
to get matching 2 to 16 gigabyte
packages and the quantity necessary for
this project we want to minimize disk
access while providing a ram an amount
that seems appropriate for high-end
processors and went on a bit so this one
we also disagree disk access is not
really going to be happening you're
talking about hundreds of megabytes max
for texture files never going to be near
64 gigabytes for gaming and this was
100% a gaming a workload test so 32
gigabyte seems adequate it would allow
better timings it allow higher
frequencies to be easier attained more
easily attained with those quote lower
end processors GT a quality settings we
also got an answer on this and we
published all of them and the article if
you want to know what quality settings
they used and then PT also provided some
additional comments where they addressed
a number of inquiries this is their
quote regarding the testing methodology
that they used and the potential for
bias in favor of Intel and that is the
document we published on our website as
well but they have a full document PDF
over there that discusses memory speeds
memory choice for capacity cooler choice
they talked about the use of game mode
on the AMD Rison 720 700 X so that was
pretty important as well and for that
one they said that some of the inquiries
showed concern over the use of the rise
and utility and the number of active
cores name of the base systems and they
noted that for thread Ripper systems
they saw improved it performance with
game mode and so applied it to all
processors but they are now at doing it
doing additional testing so that is for
the AMD systems in creator mode at which
point they'll be updating with new
results so that's it for the PT update
check the article link below for more
information on that one next one AIB
partners are attempting to sidestep
tariffs so this was published on CNBC
and on tax bought a couple other places
but CNBC was the most interesting just
because it's a pretty big mainstream
outlet obviously so we don't typically
see things from our space reported there
and this one in particular is hot tower
because video
we're just really expensive and have
come down we reported on the tariffs and
the expected impacts to component prices
we were just reporting on what
manufacturers like EVGA NZXT others off
record some on record but we reported on
all that and everyone's expecting at ten
to twenty five percent price bomb for
consumers in accordance with the tariffs
as well when they go into effect so
amidst the new tariffs though to
possibly mitigate the tariff impact a be
partners are looking into relocating to
Taiwan or Mexico for some of their
manufacturing and NVIDIA spokesperson
confirmed that some of their partners
were already moving affected production
outside of China quote we are working
closely with our customers and partners
to mitigate potential impacts related to
the tariffs on AMD based products from
all that we know today we do not expect
the u.s. tariffs to have a material
impact on our business so this this is
both Nvidia and Andy looking into this
and as we've said the continuation of
these these tariffs will almost
certainly impact the prices you pay in
the US especially in Canada almost
certainly as well and the rest of the
world might follow just because the u.s.
is the the largest consumer of this type
of technology so then what we're looking
at this point is this kind of recap a
few things in case there's still some
questions about this almost everything's
made in China especially computer
components all the parts that make the
parts that you buy are made in China or
Japan or Taiwan and so the supply chain
is entirely in Asia at this point
manufacturing will and will certainly
stay there notwithstanding this Mexico
development that that has been discussed
on CNBC's posting and the problem here
is as manufacturers try to sidestep
these tariffs if they even think it's
worth it they will end up probably
moving a lot of their production to
Taiwan but if it moves to Mexico you've
got a supply chain and change as well
that'll take some time could take years
to build it tool up and get supply chain
rolling for factories in countries away
from Asia so that's a consideration as
well which will also impact price of
course because tooling up all these new
factories isn't free the labor price
will be different outside of China
Taiwan has many
facilities gigabyte has a factory there
in when Lee and Lee have factories there
but all three of those companies do most
of their production in China and Taiwan
is really those factories are not
equipped for huge volumes like we would
need in this space to to make up for a
lack of production in China so most the
production is in China so what I'm
saying and it's not like it's low
quality parts either I mean they're
fully capable of producing both good and
bad parts as you know from buying
computer hardware but the the big thing
here is that if there is a shift it'll
take a while some of the manufacturers
we've spoken with have indicated concern
that the the tariff policy could flip or
be reverted in the time it takes to
build and tool up a new factory so
that's a concern as well and many will
keep an eye on it and see if anything
changes but it's if the tariffs are
sidestepped or not applicable to PC
hardware of course I think I think most
of us would appreciate not paying more
for this stuff although we'll see what
happens
Andy could regain 30% CB market share
and fourth quarter 2018 so this one is
something that pops up from digit times
where am the is continuing to ride
momentum of their new rise and products
and it's to return to competition for
AMD Intel's trying to come back and
doing so in ways that they wouldn't have
without AMD's competition and many of
the financial press websites have
praised Andy's stock prices in sales as
of late with some saying that AMD has
achieved sales parity with Intel a
report from digit time suggests that
this forward momentum especially given
Intel's current woes could see AMD claw
back as much as 30% of the market from
the incumbent Intel granted that would
be a pretty big feat to achieve and a
few of the market experts that were
consulted have dispensed their
skepticism about that prediction while
it's reasonable to expect and these
stock and sales to continue to rise as
well as capitalize on Intel's
misfortunes a 30% market share to happen
by this year it's probably pushing the
edge of reality although it is certainly
something that can happen within the
next month more Intel news here om have
been a little unhappy with Intel lately
so we've been talking about shortages of
40 nanometers process and how it's a
massive impact 10 tells production
capabilities to the point that they're
moving chipset production back to older
process technology and making old the
new chipsets to try and relieve some of
that 14 nanometer supply constraint and
now OEMs have expressed some concern
with their their relationship with Intel
and ability to get parts Intel is widely
expected to under supply the CPU market
in the last quarter of this year but
that shortage could extend into mid 2019
if reports from compile are to be
believed compile is an OD M for
companies such as Apple Dell Lenovo and
more additionally many vendors have
lowered their growth expectations
recorder for and revised their product
roadmaps as Intel hasn't given clear
signs as to what they when they expect
the under supply to subside moreover
it's starting to appear like OMB coming
somewhat disenchanted with Intel short
supply high prices and disrupted product
planning roadmaps
have left them looking at other options
and we've even confirmed some of this
independently or some of our contacts at
the board partners have expressed
concerns with Intel's Organization for
all of the new chipsets Intel's Mo's
have created a unique landscape for Andy
Andy has an opportunity to supplant
Intel in nearly every sector at this
point although it's far from doing so so
we have to keep reality in mind here
Intel still owns almost all of the
server market for one and epic is slow
to get adoption although it is getting
adopted Andy has also been making
inroads in the client computing sector
but and these stands to pull back some
of the lucrative server and OEM markets
as well
hewlett-packard already suggests and
expects that one out of every three
units they ship will contain an AMD
processor and that includes Hewlett
Packard enterprises suggestion to move
to epic for some of their clients HP has
also begun recommending thread Ripper
for some of their enterprise clients due
to a lack of xeon parts notebook OEMs
are stuck waiting on whiskey and amber
Lake and may become very interested in
AMD's newest Raven Ridge ap use instead
Intel shortages are expected to disrupt
notebook shipments in a big way
and vendors could look to Andy to
recover their product roadmaps and
launch windows all now it's probably
good to be AMD right now and
competitions returning in a pretty big
way it wouldn't be a proper hardware
news video without an update on DRAM
pricing a recent report from DRAM
exchange predicts DRAM will drop five
percent in the last quarter of this year
due to high bit supply but relatively
low bit demand overall the DRAM market
continues to weaken and both the PC and
server segments are expected to see a
five percent drop in prices just a quick
one here on the 9th gen which it's
really 8th gen cuz it's called 9000
series just still coffee like it's 49
ori or + + now though so it's it's
double + but we don't know if it's
double + on good just yet
so the 9900 k hasn't new packaging and
it's a guess or response the thread
rippers superfluous packaging as well
it's I don't really think the packaging
is a good investment for either of these
products if you like spending 20 plus
dollars on a box though like well you
get a cool box I guess you probably buy
one on eBay though after people are done
opening it but these things talked about
this before where people really like the
box and they say things like I'm willing
to spend $10 on a box but it's more than
that
because now you have bigger weird or
shaped boxes filling warehouses and
shelves at retailers where they have
valuable space that they need for other
things because they're paying for that
space every month so anyway there's a
new package Intel's trying to do
something different they try to compete
with AMD it does kind of feel like the
two companies are kind of mimicking each
other to a point of being annoying at
this point but at least they're doing
something it's just I kind of wish it
would be more on the product side than
on the packaging side but either way
it's it's clearly a response to the
threader for packaging for thread over
to which was also tremendously wasteful
in terms of consumer dollars and space
but of course something that people seem
to want anyway for display purposes or
something like that just not that's what
they we typically care about we
typically care about value and
performance not marketing which
a box is ultimately marketing as
expected the ripple effects of Intel's
14 animator shortage are materializing
at this point specifically 8th gen skews
are starting to see price hikes with the
i7 8700 K approaching $400
also the i5 8400 is seen prices of 205
to 225 dollars with Amazon being
currently out of stock
Newark's stock isn't faring much better
with the i7 8700 k going for $400 and
the i5 8400 being out of stock
this Evan flow with prices and stock
will likely continue into the holiday
season at this point for those planning
and Intel based build it may be wise to
wait and see what happens with the 9000
series the coffee-like refresh and what
kind of stock and sales materialized for
either those parts or for the older ones
last bit of news here there's a rumor
that the Intel Z 399 chipset might
accompany a coffee or a sky like Axe
refresh we already know that there are X
500 boards coming out and we have some
footage of those or 599 boards from the
Intel event so there's that Dominus
board there's a new gigabyte board we
have footage of them they're massive and
they're VRMs are insane and one of the
boards even has two 24 pin PSU hookups
and then six EPS 12 volt headers on it a
mixture of four and eight pins I think
they're big boards but those are
certainly coming tomorrow because Intel
had them at the event C 310 that 399 was
also discussed recently and this could
be a potential successor as well for HD
T this is some some rumor item that pops
up on hot hardware and PC builder's club
but it's supposed to compete with the
thread Ripper X series it would use LGA
20 66 or something like that sockets
whereas the X 599 series is the X CC and
LGA 36 47 sockets for those 28 core
Zeon's that are coming out so that's it
that's it for this one mostly industry
