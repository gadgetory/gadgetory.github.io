booth now at copy tax 2017 checking out
two new cases they are both some of
these sort of flagship cases this one is
particularly interesting because it's a
return to the half a series so to speak
a bit of a different name but we'll get
to this in a moment and to my right
which we'll see in a minute there's also
a new cosmos gate see 700 P this is the
H 500 P we'll get to those in a moment
but before that is coverage is brought
to you by Corsair and their new t1
raised gaming chair which is a bucket
style gaming seat for $350 you can learn
more at the link in the description
below so let's start with a half case
for those of you who are newer to the
industry you may not remember the high
airflow cases from cooler Maps even not
as forefront in the market for a while
now the half ax was probably the
previous flagship that most of you would
remember it even came with caster wheels
on it this returns to a lot of the
principles from the half series
including to 200 millimeter fans that
are included in the front so that's the
whole point of this case is using larger
fans just like the previous cases it
includes two to hundreds that are RGB
there are potential options for three
140 in the top and I'll just point out
very quickly this is a pre-production
model from the factory so you'll see
some blemishes on it that will be
corrected for the final version but
three 140s can fit in the top they're
not included on the inside of the top
there's two chambers the inside of the
top you can fit three 120s if you prefer
that rather than the protruding three
140s in this current configuration and
that also allows for an offset for your
radiator if you're doing liquid cooling
in terms of internals the actual case
mounting supports full motherboard as
always but the different parts would be
the vertical GPU mount this is a bit of
a trend this year we've seen several
cases with vertical GPU orientation if
you don't like that you can still flip
it and do it horizontally but it is an
option for you below the GPU is a power
slide shroud this part is separable you
can remove it completely or you can
slide it back and underneath are two 3.5
inch hard drive caddies above it they've
got liquid pooling mounting as you can
see right here the reservoir and then on
the back side there are two 2.5 inch SSD
sled so you have options natively for
two 2.5 inch
- 3.5 or 2.5 in the bottom if you don't
like that and you need more the front
radiator here if you're not doing the
good cooling could all be removed you
can put in Drive cages sort of the semi
modular style that coolermaster has been
doing lately power supply goes there
quite obviously and beyond that you've
got slots like a 140 back here full ATX
power supply and that pretty much covers
it the case as we know it now the front
panel is acrylic this is acrylic in its
current state and then the side panel is
a tempered glass panel we have some
shots of that separately as well aside
from all of this price is looking at
$140 right now for MSRP availability
sometime end of September most likely
and we can move now from this case to
the Kosmos case which is a c7 hundred P
so now we're at the cosmos at C 700 PK
for cosmos series is another return this
is the 10th anniversary version I
believe and this is one of the larger
cases is more of a server form back or
case or a basically full enthusiam in
terms of let me just get the price by
the way it's a bit expensive they're
looking at something in the range of 300
to 350 dollars now it's RP availability
probably October something like that
with the housekeeping out of the way
started with the case it's obviously
massive it's more in the market of
something like an obsidian or a pro nine
hundreds of be quiet case and on the
note of that case the most interesting
feature is the motherboard tray the
motherboard tray can be removed and
there's two options there one you
install the system outside of the case
which is always helpful or two you
remove it and you flip it so you have an
inverted layout where your video card
would actually be at the top of the case
something like some of the 600 C for
example we're going to be quiet case but
it's modular so you pull it out you flip
it if you want to so those are the most
interesting features in terms of other
things it's got these RGB strips that
run the length of the case is one the
side side front and then the bottoms as
well there's a button to toggle them
between I think something like seven
different colors not clear on that
though and then it also has
synchronization to basically every
motherboard on the market so that would
include
Asus gigabyte and MSI at least for RGB
LED synchronization which is done
through another button on the front
panel to the motherboards other than
that for airflow
pulls down and it just sits there you
can remove it if you prefer and
underneath there's a dust filter as you
would expect it supports three 140s in
the front it comes with two 140s in the
front they're both in the front bottom
as of now but that could change there in
our RGB LEDs like everything else in the
world is right now this backside
includes a 140 millimeter rear fan no
RGB LEDs and then four other options for
cooling you can also install radiators
in the bottom if preferred so there's
bottom radiator mounting there's a
bracket to do that and then there's an
included dust filter right here so I'll
just pull that out and show that other
than this stuff an SSD sled is optional
here if you want to expose the SSD and
then there's plenty of other radiator
mounting options at the top for hard
drive support and front area of the case
it's a 3.5 inch hard drives or you can
put SSDs there instead so that's why I
said something like a server or
Enterprise case this is a four
millimeter thick panel it is tempered
glass and it's curved which adds quite a
bit to the cost so I think that mostly
wraps up the case plenty of cable
management options but in something
that's large that is to be expected
again it's about 300 350 dollars
released a sometime in October we have
some footage we'll follow up on the
screen of the wheel of star it's called
which I believe is a case mod and it's
got a rotating mini ITX case in it
that's here at the booth as well we're
hoping to come back here and cover some
of the other more unique items but
that'll get you covered for the two
flagship cases for now as always thank
