arrived on the GN test bench now
available in the limited white edition
this $250 full Tower prioritizes
enthusiast focus functionality and
modularity above all else permitting a
layout inversion and an attempt at
mixing silence and performance we spent
a few days building in and benchmarking
the dark Bass Pro 900 and now we've
arrived to a verdict on B quiets latest
enthusiast enclosure before that this is
brought to you by the EVGA 240 c LC
which is a $120 MSRP closed-loop liquid
cooler the EVGA 240 c LC has an RGB
illuminated pump plate uses a thermal
probe within the lower pump chamber for
liquid temperature monitoring and allows
customization through software learn
more at the link in the description
below
be quiet went hard with this case they
wanted to prove a point put a whole
bunch into it to see what could really
come out of a $250.00 enclosure there
was a point in the industry when $200
plus enclosures were far more common for
example the days around when the half ex
was popular that was around 200 bucks
the phantom 820 the switch
whatever was 810 and plenty of other
cases as well the throne the Thor was an
expensive case the corsair obsidian
cases there was a period when these were
very common but versus today's standards
those cases were missing a lot of modern
features so the be quiet dark Bass Pro
900 been out for about a year now but
this is the white version we never
reviewed the first ones we've got a full
thermal and noise suite for you in
addition to building and the inversion
process which is detailed in the article
below written by Patrick Leith and for
gamers Nexus a few items to point out
before going through most of his notes
and then my own thermal notes so the
case itself is currently in its inverted
layout you can flip it all the other way
just like the cosmos see 700 P that we
worked on at PAX and flipping it around
entails a bunch of screws probably about
a 45 minute job the first time you do it
to make sure you do it right and we have
a shot of like all the screws on the
magnetic pad to show
how there it's there's a bit of work in
it but it's not too bad a couple key
features tempered glass of course it is
a tinted window for this one there is
mesh ventilation along the entire top
and bottom which those of you who watch
our content regularly know that that's
what both Patrick and I look for in a
case for the most part we want
functionality first and a ventilation is
functional that's that's something
that's missing on a lot of cases so
we'll test we actually later on tape
this off to see how much it does
passively the Intendant use of this is
you can put fans in the bottom and at
the top the case ships with three there
are two in the front one in the rear and
they are all 140s and these are these
silent winds three fans which are be
quiet
newer fans they actually retail for
around or over twenty dollars making the
fans included in this case some of the
most expensive that we've worked with
for a stock fan and a case in quite a
while a lot of the stock fans are pure
garbage and should either be replaced or
never have been included in the first
place be quiet
thankfully actually put something good
in there $200 enclosure so you won't
have to go through and replace the fans
so that's what it's got start with let's
go through some of his build notes and
then get into the thermals and noise the
build was a strange mix of convenience
and complexity the dark bass pro 900 has
a ton of features notably the invertible
layouts that make it largely
intimidating to build in but you don't
need to use all those features there's
another example installing the power
supply took several minutes of studying
the manual the power supply screws into
a bracket and that bracket slots into
four screws already installed in the
case and then the bracket is secured
with two additional screws on the side
and eventually you get an internal power
cable that plugs into the power supply
going out to the external one the manual
lists six slightly different ways to
install the power supply despite the
complexity everything fits together
exactly as intended the top front and
bottom compartments of the case although
we left them empty clearly had a lot of
thought put into them there are tons of
places to install additional fans and
radiators
all of them are inside layers of
acoustic foam and thick panels that be
quiet takes pride in the panel thickness
is one of the main ways that be quiet
can help deal with the higher pitched
wines and the damping foam also assists
in this by breaking up the sound waves
the attention to detail on this aspect
extends to a thin foam ring around the
edges of the tempered glass panel to
cushion it and seal in the noise two
fans can be installed in the filtered
vent on the side panel although this is
intended more for the non tempered glass
version of the case where these fans can
be aimed at the CPU and GPU rather than
at the back of the motherboard or if you
wanted tempered glass on the motherboard
side you can do it in the pro version
cable management is good but requires
some planning cables must be routed
through the motherboard tray rather than
over its edges as otherwise they'll keep
the side panel from sliding on there are
plenty of cable type points as well as
six of velcro ties and the sheer size of
the case makes it easy to find space
that's fortunate because without a power
supply shroud there's nothing to hide
lazy cable management the fanciest
pieces of hardware included are the Qi
charger and the fan controller PCB
somehow despite being a tech review site
nobody here has a single cell phone
capable of wireless charging at Gian HQ
so we can only speak for the fan
controller the deluxe version included
in the pro case has for each of the
three and four pin fan plugs two led
connections for the two included RGB
strips and these are unfortunately
adhesive rather than magnetic something
that we didn't like and there's an
option for PWM control in addition to
the standard manual slider on the front
of the case when connected to the
motherboard this allows the PC to
control fan speed when the manual slider
is turned all the way down LEDs can be
switched to red green blue white or
orange if you prefer as well the
free-floating hard drive slots are
familiar from past be quiet cases and
are as good as ever
each slot in the rack is held in with
three captive screws and can easily be
taken out to improve airflow there's an
optical drive at caged but if it's
removed you can replace it with an
additional fan bracket which is another
minor attention to detail that's only
doubled up by the fact that the front
five and a quarter inch bays
our mesh covered so there's actually a
mesh there to deal with dust even if you
don't install the fan well you have the
empty case the only concern we had was
the lack of powersploit ventilation this
isn't an unfortunate consequence of
being invertible power supply needs to
be able to shift side-to-side which
requires two sets of screw holes and
that means there has to be a solid
structure in those places the bottom
filter covers the entire length of the
case so it can't be moved with the power
supply and this leaves a small strip of
ventilation right in the dead zone of
the power supply fan and the rubber
bumpers that lift the power supply up
offer little air flow through the sides
we chose to just flip it over and draw
air from inside the case for our thermal
tests instead and that's really the only
major complaint we had about this in the
build process now keeping in mind a few
things cases are 50% subjective at least
it looks one thing that's up to you
build process ease of installation a lot
of that is based on experience based on
what you like and this is the kind of
case that I like working with it's the
kind of case that Patrick generally in
his time reviewing cases with us has
also liked working with so that means
that we are going to be more likely to
like the features that are part of a
larger full tower enthusiast case if you
don't generally like those things that's
completely fine but that is one of those
things where with a case it's a
subjective element we'll get into the
objective stuff momentarily but
objective subjective whatever blocking
off half of the power supply ventilation
with that bottom structure is suboptimal
for sure to put it lightly it's really
not it's not an ideal way to do it I'm
not gonna say it's not the best way to
do it because the thing is be quiet
really didn't have a lot of options you
need structure there if you're going to
be offering features like inverting the
case and that requires shifting the
power supply around to accommodate
everything so there may just not have
been a better way to do it but hopefully
a revision 2 will have some kind of
improvement there otherwise flip the
power supply face the fan internally
you're good to go for anyone buying this
case will have a guide to how to invert
the layout in the article linked below
it'll also give you an idea of how long
it takes but let's get into therm
now so the dark based Pro 900 is
customizable enough that we really
wanted to experiment with it part of
that includes a lot of standalone this
case only tests like the stock opposite
configuration the inverted configuration
front door open side ventilation porch
open it pops out taping off the passive
ducts when there are no fans installed
top or bottom just to see what kind of
air gets through them when they are used
passively for air moving in and out of
the case lots of fun stuff so we go
through all that and then we'll get into
the comparatives well start with be
quiet configurations then expand outward
with our torture test the CPU is
plotting a fifty eight point six Celsius
delta T over ambient load temperature
without adding any fans we taped off the
side ventilation just to see if there's
a meaningful impact from drafting air
the result was an increase in
temperature of about one Celsius from
taping those ports off that moves us to
59.4 Celsius delta T over ambient these
matter more when the bottom mounted or
top mounted fans are present naturally
we ultimately remove the tape and open
up the front door for the next test
reducing temperature to 51 on nine
Celsius delta T a mark at six to seven
Celsius decrease from the stock
configuration noise goes up a bit as
well show later but the thermals benefit
greatly opening the side ventilation
port behind the motherboard tray
produced a fifty six point eight Celsius
temperature over ambient not hugely
beneficial and more suitable for the non
pro model of the case when mounting
extra side panel fans finally inverting
the case to be right facing resulted in
significantly improved CPU thermals out
fifty two point four Celsius with our
tower cooler and that's over ambience
that's what the door closed just to be
clear so inverting it got us that change
a few quick things here case testing
although we can do it scientifically is
ultimately one of the most difficult
things a test because you can only
really test for the configuration you
built in this example of the inverted
layout being significantly better for
CPU thermals than the stock layout the
big thing to take note of is we're using
at our cooler an air cooler and that
means that the air cooler is now in a
straight line from the rear exhaust and
the front intake of both
and so it's basically an optimal setup
if you're using a closed-loop liquid
cooler or even an open-loop cooler it's
really not going to matter what
orientation you're in all that matters
is where's the radiator and that can
pretty much be any of the locations in
either rotation of the board for the
most part so this is representative of a
tower cooler configuration with a dual
axial fan looking at comparative data
for the CPU Torture thermals now the be
quiet dark based pro 900 stock
configuration performs about tied with
the NZXT s340 elite the bigger question
will be one of noise levels which will
get into inverting the case and boost
performance upwards towards the top five
placing it alongside the Corsair and
silver some products that benefit from
more direct airflow to the CPU and out
of it looking at GPU performance under
torture workloads again with be quiet
first the stock configuration runs the
GPU at fifty four point nine cells use
LT over ambient with a side ventilation
opening not measurable outside of error
margins the GPU runs about two Celsius
warmer with the ventilation taped off
and showing that there is actual passive
benefit here and the inverted
configuration hovers us around one cells
is warmer than stock this is because
we've moved where the video card is in
the enclosure as it now sits out of the
way of the intake fans and is really
just relying on its own cooler for most
of the cooling potential opening the
front door and sticking to the stock
configuration helps the most
bringing out 250 1.2 Celsius delta T
over ambient comparatively the stock
54.9 celsius dt lands us between the 570
x at 10:50 rpm and b quiets own pure
bass 600 at 11 and 60 rpm opening the
door puts us up to second place on the
charts between the fan happy Cullinan
and 570 X moving on to 3d mark for a
real world gaming test the dark bass pro
900 white edition case performs nearly
at levels of an open-air case like the
core P 3 considering that the core P 3
is the closest thing we have here to an
open-air bench and is limited in the
list of cases on our new 3d mark they're
all test
that's good performance before the dark
bass pro is at CPU thermals GPU
temperatures are a bit warmer but still
outside of the throttle territory by a
few degrees it could be better on the
GPU front for sure but we just recommend
either a modestly more aggressive fan
profile on the video card or an
additional fan near the GPU bottom
intake would work excellently for this
or top if you end up inverting the thing
blender serves as another real-world
test with CPU rendering and the GPU idle
the CPU scores a 39 Celsius temperature
over ambience planting the dark base Pro
900 right around where the silverstone
KL 0 7 another science focused case ends
up landing on the charts performance is
completely acceptable here the GPU idles
where the P 3 and K L 0 7 do but is
warmer than the Silverstone RL 0 6 and
it's highly directional airflow and
front mesh switching to GPU rendering
the CPU and GPU both run similarly to
the silence focused KL 0 7 there's
nothing to boast or complain about here
so let's move on to noise be quiet
inclusion of three high-performance fans
benefit the cases noise levels these
fans retailer for around $20 each making
them some of the best pre-installed fans
that we've worked with lately and its
stock configuration our system operates
at about 34 point 4 DBA
the same as when the side ventilation is
open rather expectedly
opening the front door provides
significant thermal benefit and
ultimately increases noise levels
audibly but just barely
we're at thirty seven point two versus
thirty four point four DBA comparatively
that lands be quiet case around the 270
are and pure bass 600 with its top open
and max rpm the front open configuration
programs were similarly to the
streamlined our l06
airflow case and really is a good look
for something as large and as silent
focused as be quiet system so for the
conclusion here a few things patrick
makes great points in his article when
he says that a case of this expensive
isn't meant to be for people who are
value conscious it's made for people who
know what they want and those people
will pay $250 to get it so in order to
justify the dark based pros price
it doesn't need a competitive price or
performance ratio it's not competing
with something like an RL 0 6 which is
clearly a far better option if the only
thing you ever want
is cool in performance and you don't
need any of this you just need a box to
put it in that's pretty damn good
and it's way cheaper but it's not really
the point either the point to the be
quiet case it's partially modular far
more than most other cases maybe see 700
P excluded and it achieves relative
silence it's not too far off from the
pure base 600 or 800 previously it's got
high end fans in it and if you're
spending upwards of 200 bucks on a case
this is definitely a worthy choice it's
among the top in our list for
consideration there aren't a lot of good
$200 cases these days and this is one of
them so be quiet stun well here now a
couple things
this type of system build with a large
case like this is precisely the kind of
case I've always used and I'm we don't
normally talk about like personal
history with parts or existing
preferences for parts but my existing
preference with cases has been function
focused so that's going to be cooling
and has been focused generally on having
something a bit bigger to work with
because again personally speaking I use
a lot of drives if that's not you that's
perfectly fine we've reviewed a lot of
cases on the channel we've got
experience with probably a lot of them
dozens and dozens at this point so
there's plenty of experience there to
inform your decisions for all different
types of use cases if you feel like your
use case is similar to mine and you like
similar things that I do this is a good
case it's just expensive if you can
afford it great pick it up if not there
are a couple of other good options for
you you might want to consider looking
at things like the 570 X or the view 71
both of those are similarly kind of
premiere cases that are a bit cheaper
they are very heavy on the tempered
glass so it might not like that but
other options the BitFenix Shogun that's
very hit and miss depending on how you
feel about its looks but it's another
one of those larger cases kind of
expensive but not as much as this one
and then there are plenty of options in
the 100
class as well maybe the 600 C would be
worth looking into if that's your thing
so that's all for this one as always
