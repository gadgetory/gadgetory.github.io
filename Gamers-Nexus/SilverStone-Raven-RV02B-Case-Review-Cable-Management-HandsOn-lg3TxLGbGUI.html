Nexus tonight and today we are looking
at silver stones Raven are v02
enthusiasts class gaming case as always
I want to talk about some of the hard
specs before hitting on my opinions and
the objective performance data which is
at the end of this review quick note
this case has been out for a little
while it was recently revamped for USB
3.0 support but it is a really important
case for thermal benching and I want to
get it on the benchmark so we can
compare it against the upcoming rv0 four
case which should be out sometime in the
next few months this case is actually
really unique it's probably one of the
most interesting ones we've reviewed to
date and it's all because of how a
silverstone focuses on cooling
performance overall else
when we met with silverstone at CES i
asked for their thoughts on the
industries trend toward cable management
and ease of installation features and
kind of stepping away from cooling
innovations and without missing a beat
they kind of countered me by asking how
often do you build a system and in
general that answer is once unless your
reviewers but in general you're building
at one time then you're kind of done
with it so in Silverstone's design
philosophy cooling performance is the
primary objective with aesthetics and
ease of installation following
thereafter and it does make sense
so the Raven has historically done some
insanely cool stuff with motherboard
rotation and positive air cooling this
is not news and that legacy continues
with the rv0 to that be something or
other that we're looking at today the
board is actually rotated 90 degrees so
all the i/o is exposed in the top
instead of the rear of the case and
there are three massive 180 millimeter
fans mounted in the bottom using
positive pressure cooling to force air
up and out of the case which is a stack
effect basically physics phenomenon it's
as simple as the the hot air will rise
because the Pratt the air density
difference between the inside and the
outside of the case due to the thermal
differential this forces the air to pass
straight through the CPU cooler and the
video card heatsink without any
obstruction from like say drive bays
which normally are in front of your
front intake between the intake and you
know your parts you actually want to
cool or all your drives and that's a
huge wall that you really don't want to
have between your cooling and your
components they've removed that by
making this all bottom mounted intake
fans and with that in mind the RV zo2
has only one top mounted 120 millimeter
exhaust fan that is the only exhaust fan
and that helps vent heat from the CPU
but other than that the case is entirely
cooled by just bottom fans naturally
forcing air out the top meshes the power
supply is mounted in the top corner of
the case with its fan covered by a dust
filter in the rear position externally
the actual power cable the external
power cable routes between the top panel
mesh along along with all the other i/o
cables and it emerges out the back of
the case and this means that your
accessibility to USB ports fan speed
control the power supply toggle switch
and other i/o is fairly limited being
that you have to remove the top panel to
mess with those ports from i/o includes
two 3.5 milimeter jacks for audio two
USB 3.0 ports and that's really about it
other than the switches and this is a
the USB 3.0 ports are of course complete
with a header so if you don't have a USB
3.0 header on your board it's a good
idea to buy an adapter of some kind
otherwise you're going to have to remove
the top panel every time you want to
mess with USB ports so on that note you
may have heard me rattle off mention
about fans but you control a second ago
the rv0 2 has a three fan speed
controller to two different speeds for
three fans that can switch between two
basic high and low settings we tested
the performance of each of these
settings and I'll show you that in a bit
one of the biggest advantages to the rb0
2 is its resilience to dust because the
case uses positive pressure cooling
which effectively means that only air
intake is in the bottom with air being
expelled from all the cracks in the case
and the mesh is everywhere in the top
that is so there's almost no dust
accumulation anywhere except in the
bottom filters which are easily cleansed
that's because the air is being forced
out everywhere else so the only place
where dust really to go is the bottom
and then moving to the aesthetic side of
things were kind of blasting through a
good deal of topics here on the
aesthetic side of things the case is
pretty long given its motherboard
orientation but is otherwise fairly
normal-sized it's not super tall like
the 820 or 630 it's fairly normal it is
long like the armored evolution if
you're familiar with that case the glass
side panel is found on the right side of
the case so a little bit different than
normally it's the opposite side of what
we're used to and the panel looks very
good I'll have to give it that it shows
off the core components very well
doesn't show anything ugly and really
the only downside is you may have to
reposition how you know where you place
your PC if you want to show it off
properly the top panel of a Glee
resembles the namesake raven and is
separated into two mesh panels within
that that allow easy air movement from
the bottom through the top of the case
so very good there and that's without
letting a ton of noise through because
it's not like the whole side panel is
meshed like again on the armor evolution
and before jumping into performance
benchmarks I want to talk a little bit
about cable management in this case it's
pretty crucial to air flow that you take
your time to properly route cables with
this one we always recommend cable
management but with this set up blocking
bottom intake has a significantly larger
impact on cooling potential than in a
case where you rely on side and front
intake because Silverstone doesn't have
all the ease of installation features
that some other cases have like NZXT
tees high-end products I've mentioned it
took a little bit more effort than
normally to successfully conceal and
route all the cables and in in my full
review I use a highway analogy to
explain cable routing with this case
you'll want to run all the cables
effectively within the same channel
along the rear side of the board tray
since the cutouts are basically present
everywhere else there like riddled
through it so the fans the motherboard
power the PCI Express power
and and basically your SATA connections
if you have and they all needs to take
different exits we'll call it on our so
called highway of cables so that you can
you can reduce clutter and actually
allow the rear panel to close otherwise
it'll be too fat and you can stuff some
of the skinnier cables between the
bottom fans to hide them
excess molar mullux and SATA power can
be hidden in the last drive bay and
there are a couple other tricks I
discuss in the review I'd recommend
taking advantage of Silverstone's
built-in SATA data and power connectors
for the first drive dock if you're on
only one drive it'll eliminate the need
for a SATA power cable and reduce
clutter a bit and it's a little bit more
trustworthy I guess more durable than
your average crappy SATA data connection
and power connection which are prone to
breaking because they're a terrible
standard so silverstone big props to
them for adding that in the RV zero two
doesn't have met that many tie anchors
like for cable ties on the backside of
the board so unfortunately you may need
to improvise in some cases i stuffed the
skinny zip tie through one of the unused
standoff mounts for instance and that
helped distribute cables and allow the
rear panel to close a bit easier and
alright with all that stuff out of the
way let's spend a second on performance
here Silverstone's rep asserted that
he'd be surprised if the RV zero two
wasn't the best performing case on our
bench and lo and behold it's the best
performing case on our bench so i guess
good for them our testing methodology is
to find foley in the article below
but the short of it is that these
measurements are delta T over ambient so
the RV zero two kept the CPU at around
fifty one point eight Celsius on the
high fans at ins one under a hundred
percent maximum load large FFTs and for
low settings it was I believe around
fifty feet point three Celsius which the
fan rpm basically drops to seven hundred
for that speed setting rose whales are
armored evolution is finally dethroned
on our bench for CPU cooling without our
v02 is now the highest performing case
we've ever tested including in the
enthusiast class which is filled in
right now with the
bantam cases and in fact it's it's just
the highest-performing case we've ever
tested period for CPU coin let's look at
GPU performance it's not quite as
impressive here as the cpu performance
but as with all cases we test the GPU
Thermal tests have pretty big IFS
involved
it's my hypothesis that the RB 0 2 would
perform substantially better for GPU
cooling with either multiple video cards
or with a larger video card or one that
basically makes use of a different fan
design like a squirrel cage fan or multi
fan can figure a ssin for our small
single fan normal fan 7850 there's just
no big advantage I think that's probably
because the air channels are really just
fully saturated already and the cases
air flow dynamics aren't going to make a
big impact on a small cards cooling
potential so overall looking at
everything we just talked about I'm
really happy with the case I it builds
really nicely the cable management is a
little bit of effort but it looks good
once it's done it cools insanely well
and it's just really cool overall like
the actual design I mean that's very
interesting because of the way the
motherboard is a little bit of an
annoyance when you're trying to access
USB that you know if you've already
saturated your front ports and need more
that's a little annoying it's not so
annoying that it stopped me from buying
the case if you know what I'm saying I
think it's like 180 to 200 bucks right
now so that's a pretty big investment
you're basically looking at a couple of
other options when you're in that your
the phantom 630 is like right there
phantom 820 is not that far off if it's
on sale especially and then rosewall's
impending throne case will be in that
same range as well of course Corsair has
one of their 500 cases might be the 550d
I'm not sure off the top of my head
one of those cases is right up there in
the 150 range so definitely a lot of
good choices to pick from I'm a big fan
of this case if you're looking for pure
performance definitely pick it up if
you're looking for something interesting
and unique definitely pick it up but if
you don't think you need like insane
overclocking performance and let's be
honest most of us don't need that then
you can probably get away with just
buying 100 200
thirty dollar case and you'll be just
fine in terms of performance so don't
overspend just because you think you
need more cooling for a basic overclock
only get it if you really think it fits
something specific that you like or if
you want just period the best cooling
possible in the enthusiast class and
that's all I have to say about that one
I don't have a ton of negatives here
just the couple ones I already mentioned
about accessibility so Silverstone
definitely breaks all the rules with its
Raven series of products I'm pretty
happy with it and I will see you all
next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
