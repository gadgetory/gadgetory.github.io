plans we briefly talked about clock
throttling due to vrm thermals in our a
bit wit collaboration video but didn't
take it any further
after some conversations with issues
following that video we decided to stick
thermocouples all over the rampage six
extreme x-29 motherboard to objectively
monitor vrm temperatures under various
conditions this includes direct cooling
passive cooling and a range of clocks
helping determine at what point a higher
powered cooling solution is needed in
order to prevent VRM forcing a clock
throttle before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by EVGA and
Nvidia with the destiny to 1080 TI
bundle a 1080i SC to comes with a
synchronous fan control for its dual
fans and nine thermal sensors and again
includes destiny to learn more at the
link in the description below so again
this is following our video on Kyle's
CPU delayed where we tested the
temperatures before and after D lighting
and then talked about some vrm
temperature issues where it would hit a
throttle point and we'd have to
basically put a fan on the BRM directly
to fix that problem and for evidence of
being post kyle delayed video I still
have a silicone adhesive permanent stain
on my shirt because it exploded much
like Kyle's bottle did when he tried to
pop the cork so Kyle is cursed and he
has spread the curse to me but yes so
we're testing vrm thermals basically
what I've done here is we mounted
thermocouples everywhere so there K
types they are mounted to one of the
capacitors it's the center capacitor in
the capacitor bank that's basically
north of the CPU socket and then just
above the capacitor bank following the
compass it still be north is the line of
chokes and so we put a thermocouple on
one of those inductors and then above
that there's the line of MOSFETs and
those are the international rectifier
MOSFETs so we put a thermocouple on what
we would assume to be one of the hottest
MOSFETs basically dead center so it's
flanked by chokes to the south and it's
got the erm heatsink on top of it
these thermocouples are 1/100 of an inch
thick they're pretty damn small they do
not influence the thermal transfer
capabilities from the heatsink the
thermal pad to the component in any
meaningful way and they're basically the
thickness of captain thermal tape 4 to
give you an example so we use those they
are not electrically conductive it they
sit between the heatsink and the
component so we're measuring the
temperatures on top of the component not
inside of it and the effects of case
temperature is going to be different
obviously than the internal temperature
but that doesn't really matter because
all we're looking at is a delta from
test a to test B at what point does it
throttle on our thermal thermocouples
and at what point can we stop that
throttling by stepping back the clock
the voltage or implementing a fan so
that's what we're testing this is
presently being done on open air and an
open air configuration means that we
basically have established a baseline
today implementing a case testing with a
case means a whole lot of different
outcomes are possible and we'll go
through those up in a bit but basically
for case testing we have dozens of case
tests on our charts you've probably seen
them at this point
and for a good half the cases on the
market your vrm thermals are going to be
worse than what we're showing here today
and then the other half they will be
better
it just it depends on the airflow
configuration of the case we're testing
baseline and then I'll give you some
guidelines toward the end as to how
different cases will impact the thermals
and in what way other than that what
we're getting into here the big question
is whether or not it's reasonable to
expect the Asus Rampage six extreme vrm
heatsink to be capable of effectively
passively cooling the vrm that's what
we're trying to look into and I'm joined
by Dare Bower toward the end of this
video for his own thoughts on that exact
question so stay tuned for his thoughts
as he did the original X 299 disaster
video we'll start with only passive
temperatures with no extra fan to read
about which cooler we used and other
system configuration information check
the article link to the description
below for the testing methodology
section we are also using the 79 80 x ii
that was deleted recently some of the
temperatures here are not terrible like
auto settings for example the clock sits
at around three point one gigahertz
average with complete auto out of box
motherboard configuration with the vrm
component temperatures at about 67 to 70
degrees Celsius for the center choke and
MOSFET with the center capacitor at 62
degrees Celsius a very lightweight
trivial overclocked 3.9 gigahertz and
0.99 to voltage ID brings us up by more
than 10 degrees Celsius so now we're at
80 to 83 degrees C for the fats and the
chokes as measured by the thermocouple
this means that the internal temperature
of course is higher than this but we're
not throttling yet our power consumption
also increases to 293 watts at this
point up from 225 when auto go into 4.3
gigahertz and 1.15 VI D is the next step
and puts us into throttle territory
immediately the MOSFETs are now hitting
100 cm our thermocouple measurement
which means that we're at the point
where the clock is throttling until they
cool down and then they effectively spin
back up and we throttle again we can
actually plot this over time in a few
ways but we'll save that for the next
number step at 4.5 gigahertz and 1.2
voltage ID we're again hitting throttle
territory where the CPU frequency Peaks
and drops chaotically with mosfet
temperature the same is true for 4.5
gigahertz at 1.2 for voltage IV
unsurprisingly and is the most extreme
scenario where we just wanted to torture
it here's a look at average of frequency
for each configuration as plotted
against fat temperature at 4.5 gigahertz
and 1.2 for voltage ID
we're throttling 230 104 megahertz and
so we're about 1.5 gigahertz below the
target frequency the next one shows us
4.5 gigahertz at 1.2 voltage ID where we
were hitting 33 11 megahertz so better
but still significantly lower than it
should be
at a low a 4.3 gigahertz and 1.15
voltage ID we managed to climb to 36 77
megahertz still about 1 gigahertz below
the targets and that's still from
throttling 3.9 gigahertz at 0.9
voltage ID does manage to actually hold
its thirty nine hundred megahertz
configuration and that's because the vrm
temperatures are so much lower that
they're not throttling internally
technically speaking of all these tests
the lowest configured overclock
configuration is performing the best and
that's because it actually holds its
clocks without any throttling despite
the lower input setting to demonstrate
that this has nothing to do with clock
or voltage stability on the CPU side we
can refer to the next chart this chart
shows that vrm component temperatures
when we add fans as shown here none of
them with the fans anyway are throttling
with an intake Sun and Maglev fan
positioned 1.5 inches away from the vrm
heatsink and an end ext one forty
millimeter fan positioned as exhaust
directly above it we keep vrm component
thermals in these seventy to eighty
degrees Celsius range at 4.5 gigahertz
and 1.2 for voltage ID it's about 60 to
70 when at four point five and one point
to zero voltage ID we actually don't
know the true difference versus the
fanless configurations because the
throttling means that the temperatures
would have been higher if left
unconstrained this is even true with
SPID disabled and before going further
just to kind of illustrate what we've
got here with the configuration that has
fans added to it it's an open air test
bench as stated and the Sun and fan is
mounted immediately next to the VRM it
could not really be any closer without
chewing up the EPS 12 volt connector and
the current clamp attached to it so that
fan is spending at over 2,000 rpm it's
120 millimeter fan it is effectively a
corsair maglev fan it's the supplier
version of it that's sitting right next
to the BRM heatsink spinning as loud and
fast as it can and blasting the heatsink
with air the NZXT fan is above it and
it's just simply acting as an exhaust to
pull away all that heat including
radiative heat off the back of the GPU
and get it up and into the room
unfortunately for everyone in it but it
cools down the vrm so doing that with an
obnoxiously loud configuration we end up
again depending on the clock at maybe 60
to 70 degrees celsius for 4.5 gigahertz
one point two voltage ID which is
completely reasonable that's a very good
temperature for the vrm to give you an
idea the maximum specified internal
temperature for these MOSFETs is about
150 degrees Celsius so for external
temperatures looking at something like
up to 125 C or really an operating range
and obviously lower is gonna be better
for MOSFETs but yeah at 60 to 70 we're
perfectly fine that is our thermocouple
basically case temperature so it's not
the internal temperature internal is
gonna be higher than that but again it's
all relative
Delta's between each other so obviously
that's a big improvement but it does
require a pretty serious cooling setup
that's allowed so keep that in mind you
can definitely do decent cooling set up
with a case we'll talk about that more
in the end though here's a look at CPU
temperatures for each configuration
you'll notice something interesting here
in the most extreme scenario of heavy
throttling the CPU temperature is lower
than when we add fans at 4.5 gigahertz
and 1.24 voltage ID which is
intentionally on the high side to make a
point we see that the CPU is 84 degrees
Celsius for the cooled FETs or 75
degrees Celsius for the passively cooled
FETs this demonstrates that the
throttling is not a problem that's
sourced from the CPU we still had
thermal and power Headroom for the clock
the CPU was doing just fine
the cv is only hotter in the fan test
because it was not being limited by a
choke point not throttling on its
frequency and so was able to operate at
the full specified frequency and voltage
and therefore operate hotter on the CPU
but the V RMS are cooler than previously
keep in mind again that CV temperature
here doesn't mean much for the
throttling configurations because they
weren't actually performing at those
clocks and voltages our best overclock
tested for stability and frequency was
4.5 gigahertz at 1.18 voltage ID which
is actually pretty damn good compared to
our chip
Kyle's performed well here and here's
the temperature over time for that
problem MOSFET went under this peak
overclocked configuration you can see
the temperatures are rapidly increasing
and decreasing rather than reaching the
steady-state or
sending ad infinitum that's because the
board is throttling the cpu if we plot
the cpu frequency over the temperature
you'll see that throttling aligns with
each and for this test we're at about
470 watts on the CPU which means we're
producing around 35 watts of heat on the
BRM the cooler can't handle it without
backup in this instance because it's
just not enough here's the full table
and raw spreadsheet form just in case
it's easier for anyone to have all the
data at once average power consumption
plotted a range of 225 watts to 530
watts depending on the clock and the
voltage ambient was monitored every
second of each test and kept generally
close to about 28 degrees Celsius and
the ambient column is averaged over the
whole test that we also internally
plotted over time to ensure consistency
capacitor mosfet and choke temperatures
are also represented here so this thing
this is as community members EDG calls
them a thermal blanket this basically is
an insulator that sits on top of one
half of the vrm heatsink covers it up
and it's your i/o cover so we did test
this on and off just for an a/b test
with it full credit to asus it's one of
the least stupid RGB implementations
i've seen they have an on-screen display
in it and it's like animated and plays
temperature readouts ironically it's a
it's pretty damn cool unfortunately it
does increase temperatures a bit but
it's not catastrophic so in quick
testing and not even don't even need a
chart for this quick testing basically
revealed about a 2 to 4 degrees celsius
difference dependent you were measuring
so measuring one of the ICS that just
sits directly under the heatsink that's
covered by this that temperature
difference was about three and a half
degrees Celsius increase by having this
on it as opposed to not and the MOSFETs
and chokes weren't that much more either
they're like two to three degrees max
and they are covered by the other half
of the vrm heat sink so it makes sense
so now the worst thing in the world that
said it does increase temperature a bit
so if you're after absolute best
possible performance then get rid of it
generally speaking another two to three
and a half degrees Celsius isn't going
to change anything for you but you know
it
an insulator and it doesn't really do a
lot for you other than look cool so it's
an option to remove but Asus did do a
good job I'm not making a completely
pointless IO cover it's only partly
pointless so that's pretty big praise
from us for an IO cover so yeah not
terrible not terrible but it does
increase thermals now as for the rest
you definitely need airflow on this
thing for overclocking high core count
CPUs this is a problem where as we've
shown now numerous times and case
reviews and auxiliary content cases
really do not provide very good airflow
at all anymore and they especially don't
provide good airflow over the BRM and
for all of you air cooler enthusiasts
who take every opportunity you get to
say how much better knock to it is than
everything else
keep in mind not even air coolers will
save you in this scenario unless their
downdraft air coolers because the
problem is this heatsink for this
particular motherboard is situated in a
way that it's shorter than most memory
and so you've got memory and if you have
four sticks which you should for this
platform you have two on each side of
the socket and the two on one side are
gonna block any potential air coming in
from over there
they also generate heat that heat is
gonna get trapped in there unless you do
have an air cooler that's an advantage
and then on the other side you've got
the other half of the heatsink with the
other two sticks of memory and it's it's
covered by this thing so not an air
cooler is not going to fix your problem
and liquid coolers aren't going to fix
your problem in fact the better cooled
your CPU the higher you're going to be
able to overclock sort of generally
speaking and the higher you try to
overclock the worse your vrm thermals so
as their Barrow says in a moment here in
the back half the video if you put a 420
millimeter cooler on there you have no
problems with CPU thermals but now
you're gonna throttle on the on the erm
so the problem is if you're building an
X 299 platform in a case which probably
are if you buy any computer the
item to consider would be potentially a
top intake for the case that would
immediately resolve all issues if you
depend on your case configuration you
might not even need to run it at that
high of an RPM you just need some
airflow over it alternatively CLC
mounted in the top near the motherboard
so there our instances where in a lot of
cases you can configure it so that the
CLC is mounted on the top front of the
case that would be a problem here
because it's gonna suck all the cool air
that comes on the front immediately out
the top of the case and exhausted what
you would want to do ideally if there's
clearance is mounted towards the back of
the case so that you get some airflow
over the VRMs and then that air gets
pulled through the radiator that would
be ideal there's not always clearance to
do it but try to if possible otherwise
get some kind of other intake over there
to supply air flow or just stick a fan
on a spike put it right over the VRMs a
radiator in the front of the case is
probably the worst thing you can do
because you probably have a dual axial
or triple axial fan for your GPU it's an
open-faced fan that means all the heat
goes out into the case and then if you
have a front mounted radiator not only
is that pushing hot air onto your GPU
which is another problem all together
it's pushing a hot air onto your VRMs
and you also have hot air from the GPU
to deal with so now you've really got a
serious BRM problem and it's gonna look
worse than what we showed here today so
those are the things to keep in mind
with cakes now for the very last part
here the big question is whether or not
it's reasonable to expect the rampage
six extreme a $650 motherboard in the
u.s. to maintain lower vrm temperatures
than it is here
because thus far we haven't said that
this is a design flaw with the asus
motherboard because it might not be
maybe just these 18 core CPUs that pull
500 Watts through the EPS 12-volt cables
are just too much for the VRMs to handle
that might be what it comes down to
now issues told me that they're vrm
could handle it to some extent so that
is a consideration but we still haven't
decide whether
it's their fault or it's just a
high-power Intel CPU so I posed that
question to dear Bauer the CPU is take a
lot of power at 500 watts it enters into
the realm of being too demanding with a
passive sink and basically the next
segment is a brief conversation I had
with their Bauer who is a pro
overclocker / engineer and does a lot of
xoc stuff so let's throw to that clip is
that pretty much in line with what you
were seeing yeah absolutely
I mean it just shows that once you're
hitting a certain power consumption of
the CPU which on your CPU seems to be
like 4.4 yards and well if you want to
run higher at higher volt and power
consumption will be too high that means
that the MOSFET essentially also
dissipate too much heat which then
causes the vrm to throttle because the
surface area is simply not enough if
there's no airflow and that's exactly
what we have seen on
I mean basically all boards on the
market I think is it just like is it
just completely unreasonable for me to
expect that the asus rampage 6 board
should be able to basically passively
cool itself to some extent or like how
what kind of cooling should we be
expecting out of the heatsink that's on
there I guess that's always a matter of
perspective my personal opinion would be
that if you sell a product no matter
what kind of floral it has to work in
all conditions where you would typically
use it and especially on like h EDT
platforms you can expect that they are
running for a longer period and also on
higher load or I don't know rendering
applications or whatever and it's very
likely that you run into situations
where it's gonna be really on the edge
or above so my personal opinion would be
that or at least I would expect that it
would work even passive cooling and
looking let's say 8 to 10 years back I
think motherboards back at the end they
had to to dissipate a lot more heat from
BRM and all
from chipset so back in the days the
cooling solution was much more advanced
and what we've seen this generation so I
wish that yet a surface area was poor
was basically better you know you know
the Asus workstation boards right and
those ports they have really really good
cooling and usually at least I didn't
test the X 299 versions yet of the
workstation boards but on X 99 the
cooling solution was extremely good
because they use those fin like thinner
fin designs arranged in days and that's
what vendors usually try to avoid these
days on normal main boards because they
think it looks cheap but yeah I heard
that area there yeah I can understand
their point of view because if you look
at the heatsink design what we can see
now it looks very good like you cannot
argue with that but right the
performance is simply not there because
you cannot make up the surface area with
this kind of cooling solution you would
need so much bigger cooling blocks so if
they would adapt to the workstation
cooling solutions I think it would be a
lot better I mean it also depends on the
condition how we push the CPU and the
question is always is it reasonable to
expect that the CPU would always run it
at 500 watt or something like this but
I'm sure you tested it yourself and if
you check the power consumption in
Cinebench r15 the power consumption is
very similar to prime95 yeah and I hear
a lot that people are saying that like
prime95 load is like completely
unrealistic but if you compare it for
example with with Cinebench and you see
it's extremely similar heat load it's
very similar and also if you look at
something like blender which is another
rendering application blender uses a VX
just like newer versions of prime do and
we were also still burning like more
than five hundred Watts on blender so
it's a pretty similar power load
yeah yeah so if you have an application
like Cinebench which is essentially just
like rendering and it's not using a VX
you would expect that this has to work
so that would be my my point that
something like this has to work if it's
like some obscure prime95 setting and
that's the only setting that doesn't
work I would be ok with that but there's
several conditions where it doesn't work
especially when you keep the CPU is
quite cold let's say within 420 radiator
and just CPU only water block then you
can release the power of those chips and
you can get like 4.7 4.8 even out of the
18 core which is quite massive but then
the issue is if you use this kind of
cooling solution then you have no
cooling on the BRM so there would be so
much more possibilities but as you said
yeah like 4.3 4.4 probably what you can
get if there is zero air flow and going
back to what you said earlier with
different situations in different cases
I did also some testing in in different
cases and it really depends on your
overall setup so sometimes you have a
case where you for example you mount the
radiator of your arrow directly above
the vrm and then it's the temperatures
gonna be absolutely fine for sure
because the the fan will blow directly
on the BRM cooler and that's gonna be
okay but I don't know in some cases you
have no space on top you might mount the
radiator in front something like this
and then you have a VGA that is not
blowing the heat directly out of the
case and it's gonna put the heat inside
the case and then you run into
situations where it's gonna be really
bad for the temperature yeah so I'm
pretty much covers it our thanks to
durbar for joining for this one as
always you can go to patreon.com/scishow
and access to helps out directly
subscribe for more we might look more
into these things it becomes a question
of do the other motherboards do it
better and maybe maybe the apex the apex
board should because it has a small fan
you can attach to it but yeah that's it
for this one it runs hot be careful
basically their Barrow was right in his
first videos we've effectively validated
that at this point so is subscribe for
more you can go to store that gamers
accessed on net to pick a shirt like
this one without the silicon adhesive
staying on it or one of our new stickers
