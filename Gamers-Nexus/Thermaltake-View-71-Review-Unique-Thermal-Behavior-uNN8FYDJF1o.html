Pro 900 for truly massive we weren't
asking manufacturers to ship us 400
pounds worth of cases by the time I'd
gotten home from our trip to Linus tech
tips offices we received the thermal
take view 71 a 42-pound case the cooler
master cosmos sees 700 p a 58 pound case
and the H 500 P which is actually
reasonably sized so rather than posting
a video asking if you can judge a case
by its weight will be fully reviewing
the thermal tape view 71 for assembly
build quality of thermals and noise
today and then we'll be moving on to the
C 700 P and H 500 P shortly here after
this video is brought to you by the be
quiet dark bass pro 900 white edition
the DB p 900 marks a return to full
tower cases equipped with ample
harddrive support effective noise
damping foam high performance fans and
the option to be inverted into an
alternative layout learn more at the
link in the description below so this is
the case this is the if they're all take
vo 71 we'll go through some of the
basics here I'm gonna read through
Patrick's notes from the build process
and then we have testing data a couple
of big things so first of all comes with
two fans and they are the ring fans you
can do RGB or you can do single color we
got the blue LED versions and
specifically requested that version for
this case because it's cheaper and
spending more money for RGB isn't really
something that we generally do so there
are two SKUs for this case and one is
more expensive and it comes with the
rain RGB version of the fans the fans
are positioned bottom front and rear
exhaust with this one lining up with the
CPU tower coolers and the front kind of
just drifting in now a couple things
here with the interesting ventilation
setup with this case the good and the
bad of it is that well the good is
despite being tempered glass everywhere
like the Corsair 570 X that we
previously reviewed it's I mean same
idea tempered glass on every single
panel except the back despite that
Thermaltake has left a pretty large
amount of space about a centimeter or so
on these side panels
including the other side panel their
space the front panel there's a good
couple millimeters of space up here and
then a full inch almost dead center so
there's plenty of room for the fans and
the ventilation everything's a breather
draft air in and out depending on if
it's positive or negative pressure but
that also means the pen and if it is
positive or negative pressure you have
potential dust concerns things like that
but that's kind of the give-and-take of
a case that actually tries to have some
level of cooling in this instance while
also blocking off every panel with a
solid piece of glass so they've managed
to do two things here they've got glass
everywhere and they've got ventilation
that doesn't always go together so we'll
give them that one the case I mentioned
that this fan aligns with the CPU tower
cooler and that I mean as always the air
will just exhaust at the back speaking
of the CPU tower cooler though it might
be better to do liquid cooling in this
case I mean it is Thermaltake that's
something they tend to do even a CLC
might be better and here's why if you
have a tower cooler even like the one we
have that MSI whatever core or something
or other it's like a 50-dollar cooler
it's not that big if you have one and if
you want to use the vertical GPU mount
which this includes there might be a
problem for folks who use gaming X
coolers FC w3 coolers the gigabyte
extreme coolers ZOTAC amp extreme
coolers and and anything that is a
non-reference tall PCB for a video card
there's a lot of them but anything
anything closer to like the actual size
of the slot the PCIe expansion slot
cover any card that's that size
reference or equivalent will be fine but
if he is one of the taller cards then
you run into issues where they make in
our case with the gaming X they do
collide with the CV cooler and that's
unfortunate that means you can't really
use that vertical mount so if you're
looking at buying this case right now
I'll just tell you make sure your cooler
and your video card will be compatible
with the case and that's easily done
with a CLC or with a shorter video card
just wanted to point that out
immediately they did some cool things
with this so the dust filters are kind
of interesting you just kind of push
them and they pop out and that makes
them easy to clean you do have to remove
the glass and then remove the panel and
then you can get the dust filter out but
it's not too hard to remove the panel
you just pull it and then the glass is
four screws or in this instance it's two
screws and they the back two are ignored
and it's replaced with a hinge so this
is actually pretty cool I like this
hinge door is always a big plus in my
books and when you're building in it you
just kind of do that and that's it put
it to the side you're good to go but it
makes it easy to access everything while
also doing the tempered glass thing and
it's just better than having the the
four pegs and then having the glass
panel fall off the side which is what
every other case on the market does so
going through some of Patrick's and
notes now he said that the ring fans
look good behind a tinted glass but
these stock one in take one exhaust
doesn't really look great visually and I
agree with that it performs much better
actually as well show later so that all
takes done some research they did the
optimal configuration which is better
than most manufacturers do and some of
the looks are lost in that configuration
but that's I mean you basically got it
by another fan this is an instance where
it may be worth buying a cheaper fan
just some black out cheap one to put in
the rear and then move the two ringing
fans to the front for your intake then
you get the better symmetry other glass
panels we've seen leave little room for
ventilation especially when they have
the protective foam pad around the edges
so thermal takes got this one figured
out by leaving a gap again about a
centimeter wide and the filters are
still present on the top in front so
more or less covered this is functional
enough for positive pressure setups
negative pressure will just suck air in
through the unfiltered cracks so we
would advise avoiding a negative
pressure configuration for this case
because dust will be a much bigger issue
because of those cracks in the panels
which by design actually work pretty
well
you just need to make sure you're coolly
and setup works with them rather than
against them so I keep that in mind the
bottom filter is a more standard plastic
and mesh type we do commend thermaltake
for the extra breathing room around the
glass panels but again it's just you're
gonna make use of those filters bottom
front top all of them and overall it's
what we like to see with right tuning
it's just the user has to do is I'm
tuning to a positive pressure setup
while helping to avoid dust where you
don't want it will also force air out of
the gaps so we did find that sometimes
the GPU has peculiar cooling performance
depending on which card and how its
setup because some of your air from the
front intake may be escaping the cave
before it ever makes its way to the
video card so again give and take
everywhere but you can optimize it and
it'll work fine potential buyers should
keep in mind that the size of this case
means it can fit 3 120 millimeter fans
in the front but not 3 140 s which is
the size that's included so even with
the more expensive RGB Edition you're
gonna end up either needing to buy
another ring RGB pack if you'd rather
have the three front fans or just stick
with two in the front and then deal with
it for the rest of the intake and
exhaust positions the interior of the
case is spacious especially behind the
motherboard we really noticed this and
there's plenty of place to route the
cables places to move everything around
and work with the system overall the
backside being that it is tinted glass
and that there is space for cable
routing really demands sleeved cables
maybe something like from Kayla watt or
Corsair or any of the other silverstone
some kind of sleeve cable solution would
look a lot better in this case than in
most with the blackout panel as both are
translucent and there's no power supply
shroud in this case to hide the loose
ends some negative user reviews point
out that although this case is
technically capable of holding a ATX
boards they make the cable cutouts and
rubber grommets inaccessible so this is
a downside to the case in addition to
the one or two we've already pointed out
so if you want to do a ATX you're
somewhat out of luck with managing the
cables cleanly you can work with it
you'll probably end up sending them
through the drive cages though instead
so given that this is a larger case and
be nice to see the extra a half inch or
so of give for the cables with EA 2x
special features include the ability to
mount the GPU vertically and mount two
radiators sideways inside the case the
vertical GPU mount is undercut again by
the fact that the well actually
different facts here other than the
tower coolers
also there's no PCIe riser cable
included and at $170 you kind of wish
that they did include one now of course
that increases cost a bit but
thermaltake includes it with $100 p3
cases which are admittedly far less
costly to make in terms of material cost
but still this case kind of demands one
and you can buy one yourself but just
make sure you buy the thermal tape PCIe
riser cable because you need that one
we had a generic PCIe riser cable and it
didn't fit the mounting holes so we
ended up making do with a hand-me-down
from the Corp III even then we had a few
tricks to play because it's best again
to use with either a CLC or smaller at
our cooler we have to make judicious use
of twist ties here and basically tie the
video card to the cables and the cooler
and things like that to test the thing
vertically oriented because of the
clearance issues as for the radiator
mount that works much the same way as it
does in the Corp III the hard drive
cages can be removed and up to a 420
radiator can be mounted in their place
making the fans fully visible from the
side of the case this actually looks
pretty damn good it's not optimal for
airflow and it's well it's definitely
suboptimal for airflow but it looks good
so if you're ok with doing an open-loop
configuration knowing that you have the
thermal Headroom to play and reduce the
optimization of your loop you could make
it look pretty damn cool by doing that
but it's just down to whether or not you
want the looks or the function a problem
that every glass side panel case needs
to address though is how to keep users
from promptly breaking it five
millimeter thick glass is heavy and
right now it's also expensive we praise
the thermal take scored g21 TG for it's
oddly angled feet which SS supports
but the view 71 again it goes a step
further with the hinges so that they're
easy to remove the only real trouble
with construction overall was that
somehow nearly every screw side panels
top and front seem to be cross threaded
or easily cross thread basically crooked
after a couple of days of assembly and
disassembly and this isn't just us users
building in this case pointed out the
same problem online and user reviews and
just be very careful about adding those
screws in there and there's maybe not a
lot you can do other than that as for
other accessories the rubber PSU
supports are in the bag of accessories
and they need to be stuck in the case
before the power supply is installed
additionally the rubber feet on the
bottom of the case left some light
stains on our ESD mat so be careful
where it's placed I mean we can some of
this is from thermal vase and solvents
from the feet but I mean right now I'm
looking I can see that the case was
present here previously I can see that
it was positioned here previously and
actually I can see them here they're
pretty damn visible and you can kinda
scrub it off for the most part but it's
one of those things where if you went
and put this on a wood floor you'd
probably be pissed off so keep that in
mind I'm not sure if it's to do with the
material it's just kind of a rubberized
foot so I don't know you can wash it off
just if it's there for years it might
stain though so keep that in mind maybe
put some kind of small something
underneath it maybe scrub off a layer of
foot if you're putting on a wood floor
but those are the all the positives and
all the negatives of the build let's go
through the thermals and the noise as
always we ran our basic thermal tests in
the complete stock configuration and
then we did some additional tests for
this case specifically one of which was
the vertical GPU orientation another was
relocating this ring fan to the front
because it seems like something to use
or would do it looks better that way but
not adding a fan in its place we also
tested to having two front fans both
rain and then adding a rear fan in its
place that also seems like something the
user would do
and that was a 140 millimeter knock to a
a f-14 or whatever it is so pretty good
balance overall for testing then we have
comparative tests as always and keep in
mind that the via 71 doesn't have the
airflow of a normal case so some of the
numbers look a little funny sometimes
but when you start thinking about it
makes sense with the video card pushed
up against the glass panel for example
the GPU will get warmer but the CPU
cools down the reason for that is
because you're now removing in the case
of our tower cooler cpu removing this
video card that's just a giant not only
a more like a firewall than anything
except it's a firewall that's got a fire
behind it because the backplate of the
GPU is radiating 8090 C of heat off the
back the card and that goes where into
the CPU cooler so some interesting
numbers because of those the orientation
options and because of the gap around
the panels on every side but a pretty
fun to test for that reason starting
with a torch or CPU test with only the
thermal take few 71 results moving the
exhaust fan to the front raised the CPU
Delta a bit 250 6.2 Celsius and the
exhaust slot is adjacent the CPU cooler
that directly benefits it so once again
we're the intake slot is further away
and unobstructed from the hard drive
cages the exhaust is closer to the heat
zones and it kind of gets trapped back
there so there's also free to exit
anywhere in the case on its way to the
video card in the CPU through all of the
ventilation and beside gaps so it's not
just the back that the air comes out a
lack of exhaust for the radiative heat
off of the GPU backplate doesn't help
either adding a third fan into the
vacant exhaust slot while keeping the
two rain fans in the front was
predictably cooler than either the first
two options with a 54 degrees Celsius
Delta moving the GPU vertically with
just the stock fans did best of all at
forty nine point six delta T for CPU
temperature an incoming air was no
longer trapped under the GPU and the
backplate moves farther from the CPU
tower cooler makes sense
comparatively fifty-four point seven
degrees Celsius delta T
is decent for a glass plated case with
only two fans much of this is due to
their quality we keep case fans at 100%
during testing and the ring fans
included consistently ran between 1,400
1,500 rpm they're not the best fans on
the market in terms of static pressure
but they're a far cry better than what a
lot of the manufacturers include in
their cases except maybe the likes of
someone like be quiet he is there really
quite good fans in there Dirk Bass Pro
900 or cases like that far cry better
though than what Thermaltake used in the
g20 one that we reviewed recently
installing the 1500 to 1600 rpm Noctua
fan on the rear place the view 71
between the stock Messi and the core p3
both of which are significantly more
open-air oriented in the front 570 X is
a direct competitor for the tons of
glass market but it does ship with three
120mm fans compared to the EU 71 to 140
s moving the GPU toward her test results
and starting again with the view 71 only
then moving to comparatives with an
intake fan pushing cool air directly
along the bottom of the case and with no
power supplied shroud to sync everything
the GBO temperature Delta was 51.5
Scelzi so very ambient many cases that
ship with two fans that try to split
incoming air between the CPU and the GPU
but Thermaltake is relying on some
passive drafting of air and also relying
on the CPU tower cooler to pull air from
the bottom intake and toward it or if
you're using CLC then substitute those
words primarily from a visual standpoint
we'd like to see both rain fans in the
front for this case but with a cheaper
black out fan for the exhaust you'd be
in good shape
both visually and in terms of thermals
moving the exhaust fan forward raises
the GPU dial temperature just as it does
for the CPU and that's because the heat
getting trapped from the backplate of
the GPU and from the CPU exhaust is
having trouble getting out of the case
it's getting trapped up at there in the
back corner it's getting trapped between
the glass panel and it needs to help
exhausting everything and once it's
generated all that heat and has nowhere
to go the extra knock to a fan in the
rear scored the lowest Delta of 40 8.7
Celsius
where the air pressure pulled some air
from around the side panels
and overall case with airflow this
complex requires some experimentation to
find the best fan configuration for your
build so you'll want to do testing on
vapor build basis but the worst one
overall that we tested it for GPU
thermals was easily the vertical GPU
mount at 65 point 5 Celsius delta T over
ambient
this setup would work much better with
liquid cooling on the GPU especially but
with a fully air cooled system
horizontal GPU mounting is the way to go
at least in this enclosure with this set
up the issue of CPU tower cooler
clearance for tall cards plays into this
as well but reference size PCBs will be
fine that's generally what you use for
open-loop coin anyway comparatively on
GBA torture thermals 50 1.5 degrees
Celsius is already a respectable GB
temperature Delta over ambient
comparable to the quartz here 570 X and
the 270 R and forty eight point seven
cells these delta T is better than
anything on our chart except for the R
l06
this is partly combined from all the
ventilation holes everywhere but the
rain fans allow the GPU to breathe in a
way that many other cases have struggled
with 3dmark fire strike places the
thermal take view 71 at a GPU
temperature of 53.7 celsius delta T over
ambient the silverstone KL 0 7 and cor
p3 both do well here with the p3
effectively serving as an open-air bench
in a more real-world test using blender
both the CPU and GPU did well overall
37.3 celsius cpu delta T when rendering
on the CPU is again exactly the same as
the core P 3 and then rendering on the
GPU we had a 26.1 Celsius delta T
temperature for the video card which is
below most cases besides the RL 0-6 the
vo 71 doesn't have any trouble coping
with a normal workload without the extra
fans included looking at noise levels
that the ethernal take vo 71 operates at
40 1.2 DBA positioning it as
imperceptibly quieter than the corsair 5
70 X and the RL 0 6 both at 43 DBA
the fractal master Phi C operates a
noise level of 38.6 DBA in its stock
configuration functionally identical to
the st 40 elite at 1300 rpm as for other
large cases the be quiet dark bass pro
900 sits at 34.4 DBA stock as be quiet
opted to Moorhead
noise suppression with a mix of cooling
rather than anything else really seeing
all of this data thermal takes view 71
is actually pretty impressive on the
thermal front the only place it really
has a pitfall is when the GPU is
vertically mounted and in the initial
CPU task chart where the 570 axe
outperforms the view 71 a bit but once
we're looking at other charts like
3dmark like the GPU test for the v71
blender it is either chart-topping or
very nearly chart-topping and all of
those so they've done well with the
thermals with the noise it's not
exciting but I mean it's that's what you
get when something is a bit better
thermally you get worse noise almost
always so that's the trade-off you're
making but in terms of thermals it's
looking pretty good so that wraps it up
as for whether you like this case or not
I think it basically entirely comes down
to the looks thermally it's fine there's
really nothing that wrong with it unless
you vertically mount an air-cooled GPU
and you're not doing anything to deal
with the heat maybe a blower fan would
do better but with the axial fans you're
just spitting hot air all over the
inside the glass it's got nowhere to go
it's just heating up the video card but
other than that it does find thermally
noise yeah it's a bit louder you can
lower the fan rpm it'll still be fine
thermally and it'll be obviously quieter
but you really can't do much to stop
noise when there's holes in all the
panels by design for ventilation
so this competes directly with the 570 X
they're about the same price at the time
of writing this they are about $170 on
Newegg depending on whether or not you
count a $10 rebate for the 570 X so
basically the same price adding a fan
makes this case a lot better but it's
not necessary there are a couple small
things a couple of big things that
there'll takes overlooked the e-atx
support for example aligning with the
rubber grommets or just the pastors in
general was one of the bigger ones
colliding with Tower coolers with taller
video cards vertically mounted is one of
the bigger ones you can work around all
these issues if you're building the
system from scratch
it's pretty easy to get around them as
long as you know they exist but I mean
as for the rest it's really just up to
you
do you like glass on every panel or not
yes or no if yes then look at this case
look at the 570 ax the 460 X and there's
a couple others on the market we would
if you if you would rather have just
like one glass panel like this one you
don't need glass everywhere else then we
would recommend looking at the BitFenix
Shogun that's kind of hit and miss with
a lot of people the what the 805 and
when 805 is not a bad one to consider as
well it's more looks oriented the 303 is
a pretty cool case and that is also more
looks oriented need some help on the
cooling but yeah I think that pretty
much lays it out for you so as always
