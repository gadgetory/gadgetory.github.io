of ask GN as always questions in the
comments section below for next video
I've seen a few questions in other
videos and I have a really hard time
keeping track of those so if you post
them on this one I'm more likely to see
it also this week I'm probably in
California for an event when this video
goes live but it's only a few days so
it's there and back and we'll have some
news for you after that pretty shortly
after anyway the advertiser for this
week so this content this ask GN is
brought to you by Thermaltake and their
Corp III case which can serve as an ad
hoc test bench is wall mountable you can
lay it flat or whatever you want really
and it now it comes in a TG version or
tempered glass which is really to be
expected at this point I don't know I
don't have them to see an RGB version at
CES there so get on that thermal tape
because otherwise you're gonna be left
behind by the rest of the industry as
they move into the age and the era of
RGB LEDs first question is from video
computer who says hi Wow oh yeah this
question hi why does it seem that simple
questions get discussed ones that can
take a couple minutes of googling I had
unanswered question about large HR 22
heatsink making noise that sounds like
very quiet coil wine when cursor is
moving its 100% certain that heatsink is
the source because when I switch to
another then there is no sound anymore
I'm not sure you didn't didn't find
enough info but if anyone feels like the
questions aren't advanced enough feel
free to leave your own down there
because I do look for more detailed or
technical topics to talk about and it
doesn't help if you just say these
aren't these aren't hard enough so leave
leave a comment their first real
question lunchbox says hey Steve would
you guys ever tried deleting CPUs Oh
actually I I meant to bring it in for
this video I have the kit that lunchbox
is talking about I have one of the new
rocket deleting kits but yes would you
consider dealin cpu specifically with a
rocket 88 I know there are others on e 2
who have done it but they're relatively
small channels not nearly the same
scientific method or consistency in
their testing methodology and in regards
to the IHS that you talked about last
week why aren't I
a chest made of copper or other
conductive metals they are actually
normally made of copper if you if you
lap the IHS if you basically sand it
down you'll see that a lot of them are
copper almost all of them really but the
interface between the IHS and the die
isn't always great as we talked about
last week as for the first part d Lydian
is on the radar once I get back from
said trip we're gonna be deleting at
least a 7700 K and and seeing how it
performs without the with liquid metal
so I've got some liquid metal I've been
working with rocket they seem they seem
pretty damn competent so we're working
with them to figure out the best
approach to it for this particular
processor see what kind of results we
can expect and you know what test we
should be running before and after
because once you've deleted it you
really you can't go back to the way it
was so a lot of testing to do to make
sure we have all the data that's
necessary but yes it is absolutely on
the radar and it is coming up sooner
than you might think
so once I'm back that's probably one of
the first things I'll be working on next
question
b10 Raine says love the videos thank you
my question is regarding CPU coolers my
NZXT x41 is beginning to fail I have an
X 99 motherboard with 5820k this forces
me to use the very top PCI slot which is
slightly closer to the CPU than usual
for my 980ti extreme I purchased the CM
maker air cooler because I wanted
similar performance my ex 41 but moving
away from a iOS temporarily this cooler
is an excellent performer but barely
fits between RAM and graphics card and
is a bit unnerving is there any risk of
the cooler Tower Finn should contact the
card back plate I've seen people freak
out about it in forums but I've also
seen pros never mention it this is a
really good question and one that I've
run into a few times with be quiet
coolers some of theirs have those metal
brackets you're talking about where it
uses basically a metal hook pretty cheap
kind of just brackets that hook into the
fan and then you wrap those around and
hook into the fins for the heat sink so
I've used those and I've had that
problem where on some boards
particularly for the ones I've worked
with they tend to be they tend to not be
the X series they tend to be
series boards or something like that
where the back of the video cards right
against it and even in some cases
touching and that can be definitely a
concern there's a few approaches to this
one if there's no backplate then yeah
you should be a little careful because
you don't want a metal bridge between
some kind of circuitry on the backside
of the PCB for the video card so don't
don't let any any bridges form and some
cards on the backside are more complex
than others some might have like B Ram
convey RM or V Rama actually components
on the back including older cards but
the Titan X I believe has a lot of that
on the backside so yeah be careful of
that there the solutions are pretty easy
so when I had to do a be quiet cooler of
some kind on a system where there was
contact between the bracket and the GPU
my solution was to just wrapped the
metal exposed metal bracket in
electrical tape because it's non
conductive and that was fine for me now
of course make sure you're very careful
about this make sure there's no exposed
bits anywhere because you don't want a
bridge contact between things that can
short-circuit and damage something or
destroy something but generally
something like that is fine because the
real electrical tape will not be
electrically conductive you can wrap
around the metal and if that tape
touches the backside of the PCB
no problems at all it's really it's not
in danger of melting it's not in danger
of bridging anything so that should be
fine and that would be my solution but
yeah it's something to be worried about
if it's exposed so if there's a
backplate on the card then don't worry
about it as long as you're not bridging
contacts with anything important
and those practice by the way in general
make me nervous because I don't like
having metal in the system that's not
secured by threads but it's normally
fine next question ripen Dada says
question for Steve hello I built a new
system consisting of a 1050 t I only to
know that it won't support my good old
VGA monitor can I use a passive HDMI to
VGA converter or do I need an active
converter this is an excellent question
and brings up a topic that we covered
several years ago it was actually it was
one of our big
videos for the time and probably still
is I think I called it fake cables or
something like that
and Lifehacker shared it which was great
for us so that video is still relevant
especially for this question the
question I think that we answered then
was what happens when you buy one of
these VGA to HDMI or DisplayPort in
modern day converters does it work
because VGA is analog hdmi displayport
are digital so you can't just do a
straight wire to wire pin out to pin out
cable it's not gonna work now there are
cases where people say it works and the
reason that happens is because some
specific laptops their GPUs can do the
active conversion for you that's not
really common for most systems it's not
common as far as I know for desktop GPUs
but by and large those cables will do
nothing for you other than take your ten
dollars and then you're not gonna return
it because who wants to send something
back for ten bucks and so then they they
they get what they wanted I would
recommend only buy an active converter
cables if you're going from analog to
digital unless you know for certain that
your device has something that can
handle the conversion for you in the
device like again some of those laptops
but yeah it's it's not gonna work and
that's explained in the video but
basically pin out to pin out you need
something in there to translate the
signal so that it actually will will
appear and recently I did have to
convert one of our VGA monitors normal
it's four years it's been VGA to DVI and
I still use it because 1280 by 1024 it's
perfectly fine for thermal testing it
does we don't care about resolution on
that we're just running some synthetic
burn ins so it's great because it's a
small display and it's cheap and it's
never needed anywhere else but to
convert it I had to buy an HDMI or a VGA
to DisplayPort converter and I was
worried about it but did find some that
work and
if I remember I'll put a link to that in
the description below if you want to buy
one that I know for sure on our systems
works and converts the signal just fine
without issue so that should help out
and the reason I did that by the way a
DVI on the video cards we were working
with didn't have the right pen set so
that was no good just doing the VGA to
DVI next question
slick Rx says Jen I'm running an Asus
duel 1070 video card and when
benchmarking it and overclocking it I've
noticed it runs out of power before it
gets unstable only a single there's only
a single six pin connector is it
possible to plug the GPU cooler pants
into a separate video card or way into a
separate controller so it can free up
more power for the core I heard
somewhere that the video card might
notice the open circuit and throttle or
do some other things
it's wondering if that's true I am Not
sure on the cards we've worked with I've
not seen that and we've done that a lot
I suppose it's it's possible that maybe
even likely that some of these cards ACS
I haven't worked with for a while so
keep that in mind but with the other
cards I've worked with generally if we
plug in the fans of something else it
hasn't been an issue now there could be
a problem if the fan is looking for if
the video card is looking for a fan says
what the heck there's no fan and then
just doesn't clock up because it's
concerned about overheating sure and
there might be a workaround for that
through precision or some other software
generally have not seen that problem and
again we've done these types of things
with the 1080s especially from EVGA and
MSI well maybe just EVGA for this this
particular setup but where I've
completely removed any connection to the
PCB of the cooling apparatus and
connected it straight into something
that goes into the motherboard instead
and that was for the same reason you
wanted I wanted extra power now
ultimately we found in that scenario
that it didn't matter it was an extra
you're talking a couple watts and if
you're really really desperate I suppose
that would be a place to look but I
would not expect a lot out of it you
might not even really get an increase in
your clock rate for that extra power so
that is a project that may
be you may be better off doing something
else instead of rewiring the thin to the
motherboard and that's kind of a pain
anyway because then you've got more
cables hanging out of there
but perhaps consider some of these cards
do you have special v bios you can
download if you want to start getting
into into territory where you void
warranties you get a custom view bios
and some of them do enable more power to
be pulled through the card and ideally
you grab one that's tested and validated
by at least a few common sirs but and
then overclock responsibly of course but
that's where I would start instead is
look for a custom v bios and I guess
that's mostly it you could you put under
liquid and reduce your power leakage and
that might help to but that's really
starting to split hairs killin rudder
says gamers Nexus you need to you need
to talk about the price of ddr4 Ram
doubling in price because I cannot find
out why well seen as we we need to talk
about this we are contractually
obligated by keel and rudder to talk
about this yes DRAM pricing in general
for flash-based storage or otherwise
because they're generally made in the
same place is going up so as discussed
previously SSD prices have been they
haven't done huge hikes yet but they
should and that's because of supply
limitations demands really high flash
modules are used in everything phones
tablets laptops basically any current
Mac is shipping all flash storage and a
lot of the smaller PCs and things like
that razors blades all that stuff it's
all going flash these days and flash is
also more popular and desktops so
there's a shortage and that means that
prices will be going up now that should
be resolved by 2018 I don't know if
that's what part of 2018 but that's what
it's looked like for a resolution and
for the supply to kind of catch up but
RAM normally when one goes up RAM or
SSDs in price the other does too and
that's because they're pretty much
they're made in the same facilities so
we didn't ask some t lion tour with
Kingston several years ago with those of
you who are new to the channel new
relative to this video
which probably be 95% of you that tour
might be worth looking at because the
SMT lines service mount technology they
have rows and rows of these systems
actually we talked about it with the
gigabytes motherboard how a motherboards
and video cards are made as well when we
went to Taiwan last year but service
mount machines there's pic in place
there's other devices and they put the
small SMD the small components on the
PCBs and it's largely automated not
entirely but the the RAM the video cars
the SSDs they can all go through these
same machines even motherboards there's
some special parameters from other
boards they are larger but if you go to
Kingston's fountain vallye location they
actually have an SMT line in the u.s.
still they're one of the only people who
still have one in the US it's not an
active use as much these days as it used
to be definitely has spun down a bit but
in that facility you go in one day it
could be Ram the next date could be SSDs
so the point of saying that is because
the same machines are used to make the
two products generally their prices
correlate with one another when they're
increasing or decreasing just based
again on supply or if a facility has
caught on fire like happened a few years
to cow that obviously impacts price as
well when someone's spun down a facility
or is building a new one last question
John STF 72 says I'm surprised you're
not sponsored by l'oréal because you
deserve it
well John and anyone else you can email
them and suggest that they come over
here and sponsor us because I would be
willing to take their money because a
shampoo sponsor really doesn't interfere
with hardware there's no bias there so
it's pretty much perfect thank you for
watching as always it questions in the
comment section below if you have a more
advanced question please feel free to
leave it I will do my best to answer I
sometimes I don't know the answer pretty
often actually and I have to go look it
up so if it's technical and you don't
think I'll know ask it anyway
and I'll forward it to someone at Intel
Nvidia and the year wherever it may
belong to get the
like to answer from an engineer so
subscribe for more patreon like the post
roll video as always thanks for watching
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
