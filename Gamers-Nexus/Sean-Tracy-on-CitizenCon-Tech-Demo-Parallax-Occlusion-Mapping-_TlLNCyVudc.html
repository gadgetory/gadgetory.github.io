just spoke to Chris now talking to Sean
Tracy awesome before getting to that all
this coverage is brought to you by antec
and their new cube MITx case as designed
by razor which is shown on the screen
now supports full custom loop
watercooling you can learn more on the
link below so how's it going Sean I'm
excited I was I was super nervous you
know for the demo we're always excited
to to show it off to the community but
again it's kind of like it's kind of
like an investor meeting almost right
like I mean we're going in we're showing
them what all their all their support
has really allowed us to do but i think
it was it was a really exciting demo
we're just super happy to show the
planet v2 stuff yeah yes that was the
big thing I noticed was obviously
planets me too we just talked about like
two weeks ago that's right that's right
and I've been working pretty late night
hours when we when we first talked about
it but yeah we were working exactly on
this on this homestead demo as well as
the little tech demo afterwards and so
homestead just to kind of recap what was
there it was all types of biomes and
things mean it wasn't a single biome so
what we saw a demo where there's
actually the biomes in action that's
exactly the biomes in action right so
the cool part about it is that there's a
referencing system within it so I mean
as we tweak the biomes right we can
update them we can apply the update
across whole planet we can go paint down
the update if we need so yeah those were
a couple of them and the whole idea of
the very long flying was to show you
just a huge amount of ecosystems that
we're hitting already so and then even
later on in that in that other tech time
we want to show some exotic ecosystem
because we're not just making earth
we're not just making Mars we're making
all kinds of crazy plans and some of
that bleeds into what we were talking
about previously with edge blending
right is that yeah that's right edge
funding so it's funny the Germans right
now I keep calling it super palm but
they hate that so I mean this is the per
pixel accurate edge blending on the edge
so when objects are actually placed into
the terrain they look like they are part
of the terrain there's no hard edge on
it so again I keep calling it super palm
because this parallax occlusion mapping
that we use actually we have access to
it in the depth buffer and usually with
a parallax conclusion you don't
so they've gotten into the depth buffer
so that they can actually do this per
pixel edge blending on every single
object that's placed within that terrain
um and it always looks pretty much
seamless it's super nice and I've never
seen anybody do something like this
before we as gamers have just gotten
used to the stuff flopped around in
these objects and it's all cut very you
know obviously but yeah I hope we fixed
that now I also saw so the the visual
poppin of the objects Germans pretty
good like pretty distant which is a good
thing yeah absolutely can you talk at
all about that or what are you guys
doing on that front sher ali our
graphics programmer out in the UK was
really the chief architect of rebuilding
and refactoring the CryEngine LED system
so it was really worked it worked really
well for the crisis games because the
ranges and things but like you saw our
ranges here are way beyond anything that
occurs game whatever do so some of the
reef actors he's made is making it based
a little less on distance and more on
how many Polly's per pixel you end up
drawing at certain distances so I think
we really and and this has taken a lot
of innovation a lot of work on the asset
side lot of work on the program inside
to just get that ratio perfect right and
even still right there was little extra
popping on the trees that we're not
happy with and things like this but we
take that super seriously because it's
not it's it's jarring when you're flying
into an Aryan everything comes in so we
got dissolves between ello DS we've got
the perp ixil up how big how many
qualities are per pixel anyways because
you can't draw anything more than you
know for that's what nvidia is
recommending so yeah there's some pretty
exciting things that had to change to
make that possible definitely and then
one other item that i noticed in the
demo was you guys got into the rover at
one point yeah around the service so a
pretty cool thing anyone who's solid
demo will have it on our channel if you
didn't see it but the the wheels of the
rover we're conforming to the service of
the planet that's right so is that
real-time physics or what's that is
completely real-time physics yeah and we
use a spring system for it so we have a
spring and ik system built into it and
what's super interesting about is we're
applying it to the landing gear now so
that one's a little more complex that
it's in it
it's conceptually the same idea but
you've got a set of Springs you've got a
set of ik joints and basically you're
controlling how much they're springing
how much the tension there's on them how
far they can extend and we try you know
there was a there was a shot of the
Ponte coming in landing and we worked on
this for the Connie for this particular
demo but one of the hardest things with
the ship's is that when they're landing
they kind of bounce around to these
things so it's giving this nice soft
landing gear so that when you land you
have that compression within the landing
gear so it's the same sort of stuff
that's going on on the wheels for the
road ran again you saw that as you're
going over physics terrain yeah those
are popping around and everything what's
nice is it actually gives us better
traction too because the the tires
actually drive the vehicle so as they're
more contact full with the ground it's
just it drives a lot better so does it
go as deep as more more tires such in
the ground it was what a six-wheeled VX
six wheeled vehicle we can do as many as
we like um yeah I think I think old
CryEngine was restricted to something
like 16 oh I don't think we've actually
tried to do one with more than six but I
can't say no because you've seen this
game it just gets bigger and bigger so
so then the question I have the
follow-up is if you it sounds like what
you're saying is the more wheels contact
and that were more tires contacting the
ground the better your acceleration what
better drives the more control you have
we said we set which wheels the driver
will reel and I think actually on that
Rover only the two Center ones are
drivable are driving wheels so basically
they apply all the all the all the
torque and everything so yeah it could
drive a lot better absolutely yeah very
cool so more information as stated
before in the article including
scription below we'll have all kinds of
stuff thank you as always Sean hey
thanks we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
