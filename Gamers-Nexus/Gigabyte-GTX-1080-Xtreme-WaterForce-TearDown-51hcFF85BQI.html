gigabyte GT X 1080 extreme water forest
card or something like that it's cut a
lot of a lot of words the name so this
is another liquid cool that GT X 1080
you sometimes call them GT X 1080
hybrids this one is really not true to
that name so when we use the word hybrid
with this site anyway it's generally
referring to the idea of having a vrm or
a VRAM blower fan here and cooling the
VRAM VRAM that way and then using the
liquid for the rest for the GPU this
card is different you can see that
without even tearing it down through the
window because the CLC is outfitted here
atop the GPU as one would expect and
then just like the EVGA hybrid that we
tore apart we should have b-roll of that
there's a copper plate underneath the CL
see that communicates of the CLC cold
plate and the vram so the vram heat is
synced by the copper plate and the
copper plate touches the cold plate
there's probably on this one but
definitely on the EVGA one thermal paste
between the point of contact and that
helps sync the heat from the vram copper
plate into the cold plate through the
CLC and the idea there is that your GPU
diode temperature will look like it's
higher than maybe a Seahawk and that's
because the GPU is sharing its cooling
solution with the vram and there's only
so much cooling potential in one of
these something like an ek predator
would be better and we do have one of
those to look at but this one's even
different still it's got a heat pipe in
here heat pipe probably goes down over
the v-ray or the the vrm the actual
voltage regulator module not just the
vram or the memory so we're gonna tear
it apart and look at it we've got a full
review as well that'll go live very soon
so subscribe if you want to see that but
let's take it apart today first of all I
want to thank Sean one of our viewers
for sending this over to us this is now
the second car we've worked on from a
viewer first is from Sam that was the
Titan X thank you again for that Sam and
Sean thank you for sending this so let's
take it apart and be a bit more careful
with it than with my own cards because
it does actually need to be used at the
end of all the
so so we're gonna start with the shroud
screws take those out these are just
phillips head a one or a two it looks
like you're both fine
very large screw okay that's I need to
remember this okay so a few seconds into
this we already have like three or four
different sizes of screws I wasn't
planning to use the magnetic sheet thing
but we're going to use it and that's
because these are unexpectedly different
sizes
okay so shrouds ready to come off pretty
easy got some connections in here let me
see what all these are first so this one
is the extreme gaming LED which how does
this held in okay so this is held in by
these three screws and these actually
don't need to come out to remove the
shroud so those are only used for this
and that would be why they're different
sizes one of them I guess let's this one
theoretically goes into the board sort
of thank you yeah yeah it does go it's
right there that I don't know if you can
see that under my pinky there's a on
this aluminum heatsink there is a screw
hole so that's where that really long
one goes through through the nameplate
and then into the heatsink and then the
power this cable at the top is going to
the LED on the nameplate and then these
are in there pretty good okay there we
go just required some pressure on the
pin so that goes to the nameplate and
then we've got the LED here so there's
your diodes your light emitting diodes
you can see RGB RGB so there's two sets
of RGB le
and then this is the actual nameplate
diffuser all that stuff so that's that
part of the board and then these these
go to more LEDs it looks like
let's get those disconnected so we get
the shroud separated okay all right so
there's your shroud really nothing
special the only cool thing I guess is
that see-through plastic but we'll put
that aside and let's start looking at
the board I'll probably take I might
take the backplate off
we're definitely take the cooler off of
the the GPU though some of the cables
we've disconnected here this is for the
fan we can see that's clearly the fan
and then this connects the pump to the
same power so these connect and that
communicates with the motherboard
directly and that's what powers are
pumping our fan so that's what that is
and then looking at the cooler I was
talking about same setup as EVGA but
even still a bit more sophisticated from
what they were doing gigabytes got a
copper plate here that's touching the
vram the memory we can see very clearly
there's a thermal pad between the copper
and the vram and then that has a heat
pipe attached to the copper plate over
here on one set of the vram so this sets
gonna be pretty darn cold and the copper
heat pipe is communicating down this
channel we actually have an animation of
how heat pipes work from our CPU coolers
work video same thing as with CPU
coolers so this is connected to an
aluminum heatsink which might be copper
under there we'll find out this raised
part is where the MOSFETs and the
inductors kind of are and doctors don't
really need this much cooling but it's
smack in the middle of the MOSFETs and
the capacitor bank so I guess they
decided well we'll just cool it anyway
because it's easier than not cooling it
so this sinks the MOSFETs faster bank
and the inductors and then the heat pipe
pulls all that heat away transfers it to
this copper plate and then that
transfers to the pump eventually so it's
pretty inefficient process in that
regard versus something like an open
loop where you have one block from maybe
ek that's just filled with liquid and
cools everything but that is how this
one works
we have thermal charts that we'll look
at in the review and talk about more
specifically if it's good or not but
that's how it works that's what we're
interested in right now let's pause the
backplate but first the the actual
cooler oh this is actually going to stay
on there until all of these are taken
out this time because they are mounting
other parts of the cooler
not just the CPU cooler itself okay
there's a couple screws on the top side
which you can see we're connecting right
here so these there screws right there
on the top side and probably over here
as well where you can see the back and
the nut so let's take this out
let's take off the IO shield then
progress from there
okay so shields off and those screws are
done this I just want to point out I'm
not sure if gay goodbye it advertises
these as gold-plated HDMI for VR I'll to
check their marketing language the
review but it's still stupid gold-plated
any connector well any connector in
computing USB mostly does nothing for
you we've done a video on that it
genuinely does nothing for you in this
case the gold plating so to speak is the
actual housing of the connector but the
pins themselves are still normal pins
this is just housing it doesn't
communicate anything all the pins do all
the work on USB especially that's true
when you see keyboards advertising
gold-plated whatever for faster response
and therefore better for eSports it's
all BS so these would perform the same
if they were silver is what I'm saying
and the one in the back are these
gold-plated as well or gold shiny I
think they are they are these are also
gold-plated though the camera light
makes them look a little silver so
that's dumb and pointless and does
nothing so is this loose yet what's the
deal here that's also loose okay there
we go it's got a thermal pad holding it
on or something yes okay it's all come
apart now alright so here's what we've
got this is the VRM you can see that
some of the thermal pad has remained on
the cooler that's fine we'll reapply it
once we rebuild this thing later thermal
paste obviously applied by a machine or
by hand with the silkscreen or something
with decent coverage and good contact -
you can tell by the pattern that's good
contact it was definitely on there tight
mounting standoffs a whole bunch of
screws that are triangle-shaped
okay you know we don't have that size
for the triangles but that's what the
underside looks like
this communicates with vram this
communicates with vram and this
communicates of VRAM there are eight
memory modules there's eight memory
modules on a gtx 980 are all gddr5 x by
micron and then this is four right here
is the mosfet cooling you can see it's
an aluminum plate which is about two
hundred five watts per meter Kelvin so
our thermal conductivity at 25 C this is
contacting the inductors which can
handle upwards of 120 C so they don't
need this plate but it's here anyway
and we'll now and adductors basically a
copper wire so it's sort of a heatsink
at its own and then this right here is
for the capacitor bank and that pretty
much covers the solution so here's
what's going on it's it's actually
pretty clever this is contacting the
vram directly and it's through here
under my finger which we read enough I'm
not gonna take this completely apart
because I have to send it back and I
don't want liquid to get out of the
system but under here is the copper
plate for part of the liquid cooler the
pump which is what we have right here
that's the pump in this solution so if
we look at it from this angle that's the
best thing yes this is the best angle if
you look at it here where my finger is
you'll see that it's got its own copper
plate and that's sandwiched hard against
this one for the vram and that plate is
what's pulling the heat off of this
plate which is pulling the heat off the
vram and the vrm and if I flip it over
you will see that through the middle
they've cut out a hole in the surface of
the vram cooling plate where a
protrusion from the GPU pump cold plate
is sticking out so this is connected
directly to a cold plate at the bottom
of the pump that is part of the
hold play of the pump and it's protruded
like we've seen in other models that
talks to the GPU directly and want to
add some copper mass which helps with
sinking the heat and - it means that the
GPU is directly connected to the pump so
there's no efficiency loss there by
communicating through multiple layers of
copper which is what the vram and the
BRM are both doing but they are much
lower heat devices that can tolerate the
temperature they're producing so they
don't need quite as efficient cooling as
the GPU gets so that's the solution heat
pipe is connected to the copper copper
soldered to the aluminum and the
aluminum is talking to the VRM
completely and I believe we can probably
now take this off as well yes there's
one more screw right there that one was
hidden under that was hidden under the
heatsink I think or I just missed it
okay so that's gone falls off perfect
alright so back sides actually got some
hardware on it - it's not like every
other PCB we've looked at I have to have
I have build so I'd analyze this for us
if he hasn't already done it on his own
channel you can see more of the vrm
components continuing on this back side
right here and that's where the VAR the
vram is mounted this you can see to hear
three or three here three here and two
here so that's eight which obviously you
see it on the other side as well some
kind of logic on the back side some of
these ICS are not my specialty so we
will have build Zoid look at those for
us but you can definitely see
continuation of veer at or the vrm
excuse me over here and then the rest of
it it's all pretty straightforward so
I'll see if I can have him look at that
if he hasn't already but that is the PCB
itself you've seen the front and the
back of the PCB
these connections are basically leds
leds power for the fan lots of LEDs
though and the cooler itself over here
we just talked about all this so I won't
do that again this is the radiator
obviously the radiator has rigid tubing
this is not the same rubberized to the
tubing that you'll see with a Sutekh or
more most coal IT those types of
products necessarily but you can kind of
hear the noise it makes that's because
it's rigid I'm doing that because you
probably can't really see it on the
camera so it is the bendy straw style
tubing if you think of what that looks
like and then you've got the barbs here
as always with the tube connecting to
the barbed tank for the radiator tank on
the other side so it's just it's every
other radiator you've ever seen and then
the fan is a gigabyte branded fan not
special for any particular reason though
I'm sure they will find many reasons to
tell you that it is special and then
what else is there of note nothing
really the these tubes like every other
one you'll pretty much want to mount
them like that to minimize the amount of
air getting sucked through the pump and
it doesn't really damage performance but
it creates a noise so this this card is
fairly loud with gurgling noises and
things like that from the liquid if you
mount it with the tubes up so don't do
that we'll talk about that all that in
the review so that's the teardown that
is the gigabytes 1080 extreme with no e
at the front and the capital X water
force graphics card and uh it's really
it's a lot of thermal pads it's so like
it's making fun of the name or not this
is actually pretty well built thermally
especially thermal solutions pretty
unique and cool the only card out that
we've looked at that does something
similar to this is EVGA is hybrid and
EVGA hybrid was a big experiment because
we're trying to figure out why does this
card produce higher temperatures than
the Seahawk when it really shouldn't it
should be cooler for many reasons and
answer was voltage and was because
they're cooling most importantly the
vram with the same liquid coolant
solution just like gigabytes doing here
and so that means you're sharing the
solution between multiple components
that increases the liquid temperature
the small 120 radiator same on gigabyte
is only capable of dissipating so much
heat it's not necessarily a bad thing
for the GPU because that can certainly
run even at 30 C Delta it's still pretty
happy so there's there's a point where
the efficacy becomes questionable when
you're cooling to G people or 20 C Delta
because it's just what's the what's the
point to some regard but we I do have
some coverage about that we'll talk
about that more in the future
but this same thing here you're gonna
see higher GP diode temperatures because
you're cooling multiple things with a
120 radiator 120 fan limited amount of
liquid liquid temperature goes up
dissipation potential goes down well
potential stays the same but it's being
shared by more devices so that's the
card as always links in the description
below for photos things like that our
review is forthcoming and you can
subscribe to the channel to find the
review of this card when it goes live
