nexus donna and today we're looking at a
lot of detects g 29 and g 920 rising
wheels the g 29 and g 9 20 are
effectively the same product but the g
29 which we have here is the ps4 and pc
version the g 9 20 is the Xbox one and
PC version both will work on the PC and
this is a $400 unit it ships with the
wheel the wheel base and the pedals
included along with a power adapter not
shown here the pedals you've got your
gas brake and clutch in that order and
then the wheel itself is where all the
expensive mechanical is contained so
that's where your $400 price point comes
from other options on the market include
the thrust master teeth rejas priced
similar to this it's at $400 also and
then starts master goes all the way up
to $600 or more depending on which mods
you get which wheel you get and how
high-end you go so those are the main
competitors on the market actively right
now the previous version of this racing
wheel was a logitech g27 and fans or
users or those knowledgeable of the
racing wheel space will recognize that
the g29 looks very similar to the g27
that's because it is basically a refresh
so this is similar to what we've talked
about recently with some AMD products
and other products some Intel stuff
product refresh is I mean that they take
something that exists and works they
take an existing architecture and
upgrade it with some tweaks so that's
what's happened here the wheel is the
same geometry it has the same feel
texture and shape as the g27 wheel the
wheel is 270 millimeters across it's
about 11 inches or so and the same as
the g27 the major difference here
between the two products each 27 and d29
other than the price is the button
layout the addition of new buttons to
the wheel and then some of the internal
motor stuff so this uses a helical
gearing system which is what the g27
uses also with racing wheels at the high
end especially there are two primary
systems through which the wheel is
turned and operated
either helical gearing or a belt system
and you can think of the belt system
really similar to any other belt that
you're familiar with if you think of how
a belt works in a car same idea just
much smaller scale so Thrustmaster
likes to use the belt system and it's a
newer technology it's still being put
through the paces still sort of being
determined how reliable that is over
time the helical gearing system is
tried-and-true is certainly a phrase
that could be applied to it but it is an
older technology that doesn't mean it's
bad necessarily but it does lose some of
the advancements put in place by the
belt system that said you know that it
works and lasts for a pretty long time
so there are different pros and cons
there the belt system is argued to have
a smoother action when turning the wheel
side to side and the helical gearing
system sort of feels like I don't really
want to use the word grindy when you're
moving it because it's not an abrasive
feel but it does feel a little bit more
stiff and rigid than the belt system now
some drivers may actually like that and
some might not like it so it's really
personal preference it certainly feels
grittier in that regard other additions
to the g29 include the upgrade of Hall
effect sensors so these were not present
in the g27
and they've been demanded by the racers
in the community for quite a while now
Hall effect sensors basically use
electro magnetics to sense the
positioning and tracking of the wheel
which helps increase its accuracy in
game and that's been a big issue with
any type of peripheral that is not a
mouse or keyboard including Hotez and
flight sticks and things like that is
the accuracy of input in the game the
g27 used optical sensors which are more
prone to damage or decay over time
they're certainly more prone to dust
interference and this uses Hall effect
sensors so that does increase cost a bit
we're not sure how much but that
certainly adds to it now one thing I
want to note here while we're talking
again about cost is that the g29
does not include a stick shifter even
though it's got a clutch pedal over here
on the on my right and
the previous model the g27 did include a
shift stick so that you could mount it
basically to the same service separately
from the wheel and just shift like a car
would that is not included here the new
version of the g29 shifter that was made
in tow with this product is $60 so you
have to add that to the cost if you do
actually want to use a stick to shift if
you don't want to use one or if you're
doing more racing games that are of the
Formula One or GT style racing where
you're using modern cars with flappy
paddles this does have flappy paddle
shifters there and they make a pretty
pretty strong click you can hear when I
do that here so definitely very strong
and clicky doesn't feel like cheap
plastic like a lot of the other flappy
paddles we've tested on lower-end wheels
and that's what you're working with if
you don't buy the additional shifter the
wheel is hand-stitched and uses a
brushed metal plate it looks like a
brushed aluminum plate here on the front
for your cross bars and support it's
very sturdy and it mounts pretty well to
most surfaces you would want to mount it
on something like this this is a pretty
loose table it's just a folding table
you would want to mount it to something
more permanent
like a play seat or some specialized
need for seat type of thing where you
spend extra money to get a sturdy bar to
mount your wheel base to or you just put
it on a coffee table that's got room
underneath for the pedal deployment and
that is one problem we ran into with the
wheel if you're not a very serious sim
racer you don't have the seat set up all
existing already that is an added cost
you might want to factor in or in the
very least make sure you have some
furniture that is already compatible
with a wheel that very aggressively
delivers forced feedback and that is
something that this is actually pretty
good at the force feedback as indicated
by the name driving force of the g29
is very strong you've got nine hundred
degrees of rotation until it hits the
border here and when I hit that edge you
see that a pretty hard resistance
because it physically can't turn any
further and that resistance is similar
to what you feel when you get hit in the
game by another driver or
hit a wall or something like that it's a
very strong force similar to what is
experienced in arcades but depending on
which arcade game you're playing
potentially much higher quality and the
force feedback adds to the experience
something that I do not normally
experience in racing games when I'm
using a controller or a keyboard and
mouse which is how I don't really play
with the keyboard mouse and that
addition is a more gritty real
true-to-life feeling where you feel more
connected with the road and that is
something that will be added by the g27
which is cheaper $240 by the g29 $400 by
the Thrustmaster competing $400 device
and by some of the fnatic devices so
it's not like it's unique to the g29 but
for those who have never used a racing
wheel before that is the one thing that
you will appreciate most is that you'll
suddenly have a much more direct
connection with the vehicle in game and
if you drive in real life at really any
level of aggression you'll feel in
position to do that in the game so it
actually does convey a real sense of
usability to have some experience in
life driving your car and for example
the one thing I picked up on immediately
was when you make an aggressive turn and
you let go of the wheel it'll actually
spin back until you grab it again to
stop it just like a real vehicle would
do let's talk about the build quality
here the hand-stitched leather of the
g29 racing wheel has a very high quality
feel to it it actually is real leather
and it feels similar to what you would
get in a real car so that is certainly
adding to the experience the shifter
paddles are strong at they're made of
metal first of all and they make a
resilient click to them when you use
them so you do know for certain that it
has been depressed when you're shifting
in the game and then the pedals are
equally high quality and that the
resistance applied to your foot when
you're pushing it down or in this case
my hand is fairly strong and it changes
based upon how far the pedal is pressed
so if you go get in your car and you
push down the brake pedal as the best
example there is a point at which the
pedal begins to dampen as
it gets pushed farther into the base and
the power output depending on the
vehicle the power output will change
based on how far your hard you're
pressing it that is conveyed here the
brake pedal has had a damper add-in to
it so that is not something that existed
on the g27 for owners of the g27 racing
wheel and the damper when you push it
down it actually requires a pretty huge
amount of force it's certainly not
something you want to do with your hand
like I'm doing right now and that's good
and bad it takes a little bit to get
used to
I liked the extra force it's quieter and
it does feel more correct to a real car
but it makes it harder to push down
hopefully that is something that will
increase the durability of the pedals in
the long run I think it probably will
the clutch pedal I haven't had a chance
to use and that's because this does not
ship with the shifter and that's really
one of the big flaws of the g29
the g27 for PC users is still a very
good buy it's 240 dollars now it comes
with the stick and it's basically the
same product except with a few core
items changed but in terms of the look
the feel and the mechanics it's very
similar the main differences are the
Hall effect sensors added to the g29 so
there's theoretically improve your
accuracy but really it's more of an
issue of how long to the optical sensors
last and the other major difference is
the pedal damper applied to the brake
pedal so if you're buying strictly for
PC you'll get a very similar feel from
the g27 at a huge discount and that's
something that we strongly recommend
looking into especially if it's a
starter wheel and you don't want to
invest too much and then if you're
buying for PlayStation and Xbox you're
probably looking into things like the
thrust master options as well which I'm
not too familiar with all I know is that
they use the belt drive system and
that's gotten pretty good reviews so far
from the community but it's the jury's
still out on how well that will hold up
as time progresses the quality of
experience provided by the g29 is very
high it adds to the gameplay
considerably to have any racing wheel of
a reasonable quality or better this is a
very high quality build construction
it's got a strong base there's no
sliding or wobbling when the wheel does
exert its force feedback and it is a
pretty powerful kick the in-game options
for configuring games like project cars
are very detailed and allow for user
fine-tuning if you do want to change
that force feedback or steering dead
zones or things like that and Logitech
pays attention to a lot of the small
details so it is a very high-end build
quality product everything is pretty
agreeable with the wheel the one thing
that some users who are more
enthusiastic may have a disagreement
with is the use of that helical gearing
system over the belt drive but for
someone like me I actually do like the
gearing system quite a bit I like that
it feels gritty and strong and I do
trust it because I'm used to it now with
all of that set the price is high so
here's what I think I think that this
should either be a much cheaper set up
the wheels and the pedals or in the very
least they should throw in the shifter
with the rest of the bundle so I would
be a buyer of this kit closer to 300 or
somewhere in that area especially if it
includes the shifter up until that point
I am likely a buyer of the g27 at $240
it's a very strong and durable wheel set
the base is similar to this in that it's
very sticky and it doesn't get thrown
off the table like some of the other
devices on market will do they'll wobble
and it's cheaper so for PC users look at
the g27 if you really want the g29 for
the Hall effect sensors sure but don't
upgrade from the g27 directly to this
because it's not a massive upgrade and
that's a pretty big gap you're paying
$400 to make a small move overall I'm
very impressed by the integration and
software support on Logitech spar with
project cards and some of the other
racing games my project cars especially
takes a cake because it allows the fine
tuning required of a racing wheel for
those who are fanatical about it and I
do think that the build quality is very
high
it's sturdy its stable those aren't
and things there is a hidden cost that
you might need a special setup a chair
or a base to mount the wheel to so if
you're new to racing and racing wheels
do consider that look at the play seat
for example they give you a ballpark
estimate of where those land you for
price it's in the two hundred three
hundred dollar range but you could do it
cheaper with real furniture that's
actually stable like I was using with
the TV when testing this and the pedals
stay in place and feel pretty good they
have grips that dig into the carpet if
you've got carpet and they've rubber
feet that dig into the harder floors if
you've got those look at other options
Thrustmaster has good stuff the t300 the
tio are the t 500 RS something like that
it's type in T 500 and you'll find it
and those are some pretty popular
options for the ps3 ps4 and PC in that
group and then look at the g27 so that
