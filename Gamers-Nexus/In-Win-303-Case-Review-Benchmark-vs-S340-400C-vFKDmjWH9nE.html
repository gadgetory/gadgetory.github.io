expensive enclosures like the $2,400
each tower that we saw at CES and
Computex previously which is syn
animatronics transformer type of thing
they've also got the $400 and up
amalgams of tempered glass and aluminum
like the D frame and things like that
and they've never really made a good
case for the mainstream market but in
ones finally trying and they're making
that effort with the in wind 303 that
we're reviewing today before we get into
that this coverage is brought to you by
MSI and their new MSI GTX 1060 gaming X
with Twin Frozr six cooler available now
at Computex this year we got a glimpse
at the n1 303 and 509 cases actually
being made in the factory and we have
some footage of that for you throughout
this video but you can check out our in
win factory tour for more so we saw
these things being made the 303 is a $90
case which does make it one of the more
affordable cases that n1 does offer and
that puts the 303 in competition with
the likes of the 400 C from Corsair
about a hundred bucks we reviewed that
previously it's a bit more expensive
than NZXT s340 a bit more updated -
which is about a $70 case and so it fits
in that sort of mid-range but affordable
market let's run through the specs
before getting into thermal testing
acoustics and build quality the n1 303
enclosure ships in black and white
models both versions of the case have a
tinted three millimeter thick tempered
glass side panel and both use LED
illuminated nametags and i/o ports on
the front the 303 is built of secc steel
that is one point two millimeters thick
making the paneling one of the thickest
on the case market especially at this
price range most competition in this
price range just for perspective uses
about a 0.8 millimeter thick steel
paneling instead the case supports ATX
micro ATX and mini ITX and motherboards
and we'll talk about some ATX fitment
issues later expansion slot support is
up to seven PCIe devices which can be up
to 350 millimeters in length through the
video card which accommodates basically
everything on the market power supply
support maxes out at 200 millimeters
along with the ATX 12 volt specification
and the maximum CPU heatsink height is
160 millimeters the case we received
includes zero fans I've seen some folks
receive a case with rear fan
pre-installed but ours did not include
one and product listings on us retailers
like new egg do not currently indicate
inclusion of a fan so we're reviewing it
with that understanding that no fan is
pre included in wins a cooling support
allows for 120 millimeter cooling
devices in the rear slot three 120
millimeter bottom fans and three 120
millimeter top fans or a three sixty
millimeter radiator maximally if you
prefer that for drives the 303 can
support two three and a half inch hard
drives on two two and a half inch SSDs
or laptop hard drives and up to three
bays can be used simultaneously the case
weighs 24 pounds definitely making it a
bit heavier and sturdier than similar
cases in its price range and that's
largely because the extra thickness of
the paneling and the three millimeter
thick tempered glass
let's talk design at first the n1 303
subscribes to the industries trend of
tempered glass panels for this year
which we talked about following Computex
2016 and it's also got a semi
minimalistic look in that there's no
crazy gamer screaming plastic appendages
sticking off of it but other than that
we are seeing this sort of trend of
tempered glass and somewhat minimalism
in when it did sort of set this trend
with the D frame a couple of years ago
at CES and with most of their other
cases the H frame included that all have
tempered glass paneling but have been
traditionally very expensive and we're
talking four hundred dollars plus
externally anyone has taken a few small
steps that differentiate an already
mature case market cases have a
fundamental set of rules obviously that
don't really change for the most part
but there's still room to innovate and
it's small but in in ones at 3:03
there's an LED illuminated nametag
instead of i/o ports and that includes a
mechanically pretty sound power switch
that I'd like actually the LED
illumination fits with the graceful
aesthetic and reminds us of some of the
small steps NZXT took with it's s 340
the case is otherwise a barren on the
front and top breadth of any gamer edge
or even ventilation and cooling and the
side panels are where the most
interesting stuff is going on anyone has
opted for a full side window
and it's also using a honeycomb top
mounted PSU cage at half width to create
an illusion of greater interior space
than it is actually available it's sort
of like an interior design trick but for
computers the right panel is secured
with large thumb screws that protrude
from the panel resting just above the
honeycomb design and using that thicker
steel makes for sturdier paneling and a
feel of higher quality most of the
competition does opt for a zero point
eight millimeter thick steel panel and
some of them are as flimsy as 0.6
millimeters which is actually very
noticeable to the touch and there's some
acoustic benefit to think our paneling
but it is mostly a psychological thing
that feels sturdier which tends to
coincide with a perception of higher
quality ventilation intake is entirely
through the bottom of the case sort of
following a stack effect cooling pattern
the bottom of the case can theoretically
support three 120 millimeter fans
maximally but we had issues with fitment
installed in the bottom rear slots some
fans will collide with the motherboard
depending on your board or cause issues
with connecting FPC headers we mostly
relied on using the bottom front intake
when testing fan mount positions for the
curious the top fans don't actually
mount to the top of the case like
normally it's a little bit different
than that the sweet generous setup of
the interior sees the top fans at
mounting internally vertically against
the power supply shelf which is about
half the width of the total case the
fans then pump heat into the power
supply shelf and the PSU it handles
dissipation out the back of the case for
almost all power supplies this should
not substantially increase the heat
within the unit the only exception would
be if you mounted a 128 millimeter
radiator straight in front of the PSU
then attach that to a hot CPU or GPU
like an FX 9000 series chip and we
wouldn't really recommend that for
larger radiators the heat is spread out
enough over the surface area that it
will dissipate more evenly it's clear
that the case was mostly built with
radiators in mind and one note here the
top mounted radiators are only supported
in multiples of 120 millimeter fans even
though the Shelf would easily
accommodate a 288 millimeter radiator so
we really
jinhwan would have included mount points
for 280 millimeter radiators CPU tower
support is only 160 millimeters which is
sort of a weak spot in comparison to the
rest of the specs and that eliminates a
lot of the higher-end units from be
quiet Noctua and anyone else trying to
create a cooler that fits with the full
display style of the window let's run
through the thermals our full testing
methodology is defined in the review
linked in the description below and we
did recently update our methodology for
cases so these results are not
comparable to previous case reviews
we've done you'll have to look at these
charts independently from previous
results because of those changes like
over clocks and things like that and
also we use one of these which helps us
actively monitor the ambient temperature
this logs every second we subtract the
value seconds a second from the value
second a second of the CPU cooler the
GPU things like that so that does ensure
a high level of quality and validation
and accuracy with our tests and if
you're curious about how that works our
delta T over ambient video will explain
more of that without any fans we're
seeing the n1 303 sustain a CPU
temperature of 37.3 Celsius delta T when
under full CPU a GPU load with a CPU fan
at 100% in the GPU fan at 55% you can
read why we do that in the article idle
is at 17.5 Celsius NZXT s340 only
marginally cooler than the 303 at 36.7
celsius delta T though it's idle
temperature is a full three and a half
Celsius lower at 14c adding a bottom and
rear fan to the 303 reduces idle
temperatures noticeably as does adding a
bottom fan alone but we actually saw the
load temperature slightly increase which
can be a bit confusing at first glance
for clarity this review has delayed
about five days because we retest this
in several different positions with the
fans and with different hardware and
even revised on the test methodology to
validate the results but what we came up
with is as follows the bottom intake in
the front bottom position is propelling
what little air it can get access to up
and pass the GPU which reduces some of
the blower fans efficacy went under load
and at higher rpms especially
considering our PCIe SSD down there as
well in the lowest slot the PSU is also
facing with the air channels and that
fan is faced internally to the case so
it's not a standalone loop like you find
in most cases and that does change the
cooling patterns here's a quick look at
the noise chart as usual the cases are
fairly comparable across brand we might
see more acoustic differences with
something like it be quiet case or a
fractal case but we'll look at that in
the future with a more silent specific
case review or roundup thermally with
our setup the n1 303 is pretty
unimpressive but it's still permissible
it's only marginally ahead or behind of
the s3 40 depending on what you're
testing what the fan setup is things
like that and that's through 40 is
pretty good in terms of just thermals
for a single GPU case a small box that's
not trying to be loud but I did say
single GPUs so we wouldn't really
recommend doing a dual GPU setup in this
I worked on testing this case and a
couple other cases with Mike he does
some of our test stuff for cases and
dual GPU setup you run into an issue
where especially if you're trying to do
a PCIe SSD just definitely don't do the
case in that regard because then you're
relying on the bottom for all of your
intake you can't install fans there for
the most part depending again on the
setup and the form factor the board and
things like that but if you can't
install fans down here suddenly the top
card will choke on air intake and this
is something that we'll be looking into
more in the future with multi-gpu
testing for cases that'll be added very
soon but other than that just thermally
unimpressive but not bad and airflow is
a little bit tricky to look at measure
with the PSU have in its own intake in
the case that's different and actually
pretty cool in some ways we talked about
that with the Corsair 600c which also
had its power supply intake in the case
and influenced air channels in a way
that for that case was actually a
beneficial output so this case will
perform worse in thermals than something
like a 600 C or a 400 C or any case
that's thermally driven thermal take
cases for the most part but in terms of
other comparable cases like the s 340
you're basically about the same and
unless you have very specific cooling
needs these are all going to be fine
for
the average PC build especially if it's
a single GPU in terms of the big picture
the n1 303 has a clean design that
doesn't go crazy with minimalism like
the s3 40 and it uses sturdy materials
with a high build quality the tempered
glass is tinted and visually superior to
the usual acrylic found on these cases
and structurally superior for that
matter the honeycomb design helps bring
some flair to the paneling and is well
engineered and LCS support is mostly
top-notch that we really do think in
when should have added mount points for
280 millimeter radiators as they easily
fit in windows a lot of small things
right with a 303 to the name tag and
front IO LEDs are unique and not
adolescent the dust filter pulls out
sideways so the case doesn't have to be
moved away from the wall for once to
remove that dust filter and clean it out
and the paneling is made of far thicker
steel than its competitors landing a
feeling of higher perceived quality and
then there's of course even in
phantasmal detail internally like the
pass-through for the screwdriver to
access the bottom expansion slot without
risking cross threading very small
detail that they obviously thought of
it's got room to improve like better
support with large radiators the two
eighty millimeters for example and
better cable management passage for ATX
boards would also be appreciated since
the current ones get blocked when you
install the board thus leaving cables
plainly visible and routed through the
main part of the case actually kale
management is the biggest point where
the 303 could improve after the bottom
fan clearance issues with some
motherboards anyway the small and big
wins of the in win three or three
outweigh those growth points the case is
a $90 enclosure that's a very high build
quality it competes directly with the
400 C and s 340 the last 340 is a bit
cheaper and the 400 C is $10 more those
are the two cases I would recommend
looking at in comparison to the 303 if
you want to research your options fully
and cooling is acceptable it's not great
except all for a single GPU certainly
and this case is a good fit for
mid-range gaming PC's it's made a couple
of small moves to innovate in some
regard in the market too which is a
stagnant market so that is all for this
