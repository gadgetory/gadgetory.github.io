hotel room at PAX East 2016 quite
obviously but I wanted to post an
updated video addressing the question of
should I wait to buy my GPU or build my
rig for polaris or Pascal will do
another one of these on broad well II
and some of the new Intel CPUs as well
and DCP is but for now we're just
talking about Pascal and Polaris and
before we getting to that this PAX East
coverage is brought to you by CyberPower
who make the fame book that conveniently
we recently overclocked past twelve
hundred megahertz I think of the GPU but
let's talk about Pascal and Polaris so
the question here previously should I
wait or should I buy now in the video a
few months ago I said just buy whatever
you need for your rig just buy it
several months out we have no confirmed
dates there's no real rumors when these
things are going to ship definitively so
my advice was it unless you really just
don't need to build a machine at that
point the advice was to buy things have
changed because these devices have
gotten a lot closer we can reasonably
expect at least an announcement from
both vendors sometime around computex
that tends to be their history and
computex this year is May 31st to June
something fourth or fifth something like
that so there should be an announcement
around that time frame it would be
earlier in the show and if not then we
can expect one definitely in the summer
sometime so that known that puts us
anywhere from about a month max maybe
two months before at least some kind of
announcement from one of the vendors if
not both and the vendors being AMD and
NVIDIA one to two months isn't that long
to wait if you don't need a machine
today this instant but there's a few
things to look at here so there's gaming
users who are just either doing
mainstream gaming don't care about super
high graphics there's enthusiast gamers
and then of course there's the
production audience and we address all
those on the site because that's what we
do we do production we do gaming with
the production side of things the thing
to look at of course is if you wait are
you hindering your timeline to produce
whatever the content is that you're
making if waiting is putting you behind
on rendering or if you need a machine to
make money and obviously my advice would
be by the thing you need
it or at least a step between because
you've got to make money and if you need
a GPU to do it for CUDA acceleration or
opencl acceleration from either vendor
then you should just buy now don't wait
because you sacrifice your income if
you're a gamer or if you're maybe a
hobbyist producer like for YouTube and
you don't necessarily live off of it
then these vice changes a bit so I would
say generally similar to the previous
advice if you don't need a machine this
instant today if you can still get your
gaming done if you're not going to be
hit with work or vacation or whatever in
the summer that will make it impossible
for you to game and you want to do it
now it might be worth buying a card but
do note that within the next few months
there will be announcements from the
vendors officially finally posting some
kind of Polaris or Pascal information
for both and the Pascal test the p100
was announced at gtc not DC so it's
obviously all underway Pascal has
officially entered production polaris
they've done several demos at the show
is now we've seen the TDP demos and we
know that it exists and is functional
and that is probably being made on mass
now if not very shortly so here's one
thing you could do if you are ok with
ignoring the question of waiting for
Intel or Andy Zen is so far away I
wouldn't wait for it we'll talk about
that more later Rodwell e a different
story and then the things after sky like
I probably wouldn't wait for those
either so that said one option would be
to build your rig sort of for the most
part today maybe get a lower on GPU use
one of your old ones cannibalize it from
an existing system and then just run
like that for a month or two or maybe
three until things are good to go one
thing to note here is that a lot of
people seem to expect prices will
immediately drop on these new
architecture ship historically that's
not really been the case in fact as GPUs
exit production prices tend to go up so
you might see a little dip as the new
skus for the same architecture come out
like when the 980 TI came out the 980
dropped or when the fury x came out the
other cards 3 90 x dropped a bit but
that's different from a new architecture
coming out entirely generally we see
prices go up for existing cards and I
think that's probably because
they're trying to clear stock of course
but the users of existing cards who
wanted to sli or crossfire are now
freaking out trying to buy their cards
and some of them may not understand that
you can just buy a new one and be better
off with a new single GPU on a new
architecture so I think that's why that
happens but that's all topics so I would
not expect price drops on GPUs and you
can generally expect the new
architectures we price about the same
structure as the current generation it's
been true for the past several
generations high-end ends be 600 700
dollars somewhere in there and then the
the low n tends to be 150 ish for the
first card launched like the 750 Ti the
r9 270x and somewhat previous gen cards
there's another reason though that you
should be a bit in between on waiting or
at least aware of what happens so just
because the new architectures launched
doesn't mean you get your card that day
or that week and that's two reasons one
is stock they run out and two is that
not all excuse are announced at once it
could be the low end comes out first
could be the high and that comes out
first and there's definitely it's almost
never the mid-range actually I cannot
remember a time when a mid-range card
came out first it's either cheap or
expensive if you're going to be in one
of those categories I guess it's worth
waiting if you for sure are in the
mid-range you might be waiting a bit
longer could be several months and I
would just consider building the rig put
something in there that you're okay with
for now and could maybe repurpose or rip
it out of an old machine and use it and
then buy the new ones if you really feel
it's necessary when those come out or if
you're doing anything specifically that
you know of with the new AP is or VR
it's worth waiting to see how those new
cards react to that technology because
that's been in development with these
new cards so they will be built from the
ground up well maybe not the ground up
but from the mid up at the least to
support the new tech so adjust some very
quick and informal thoughts this is not
supposed to be super technical video i'm
in boston in a hotel room and I just
thought I'd address it because we've
been asked on the show floor a couple
times my fans who approach whatever
comments on the videos so I want to
throw that out there but thank you for
watching if you have thoughts on this
topic just person below and get some
discussion going my very briefly recap
thoughts are if you're in production you
need it for money it being the GPU and
buy your thing and make your money if
you're gaming and you do this for fun
and you don't need a machine today
because you have one today that kind of
works pretty well then just wait and if
you're a gamer who doesn't yet have
their machine if you're trying to build
it soon but you don't have something
that you're playing right now then it
becomes a question of how patient are
you what's your time look like in the
summer in that case you have to decide
what you're doing there but that's kind
of the brief thoughts thank you for
watching comment below all that stuff
patreon petrol video I'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
