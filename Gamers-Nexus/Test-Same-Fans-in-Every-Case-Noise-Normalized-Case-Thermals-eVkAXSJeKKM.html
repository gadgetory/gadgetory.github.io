published we're taking a very popular
viewer request which is to update our
testing methodology for cases and expand
it even further so one of the things
we've wanted to do for a long time is
expand upon our already existing four
years now noise normalize testing for
coolers and add it to cases more on what
that means in a moment and then you all
wanted us to do a standard set of fans
for testing all the cases that come
through the lab so we've done that and
today we'll be looking to see whether or
not you all led us astray before that
this video is brought to you by drop and
their HD 6xx headphones the 6xx
headphones offer high quality audio
output with wide device compatibility
mouth drops 6xx also includes a six-foot
cable with 3.5 millimeter plug alongside
a quarter inch adapter for those who
might want to plug into an app the 6xx
focuses its energy into balancing the
sound leaning toward warmer and base
your audio they're also easy to
disassemble and replace individual parts
making these headphones trivial to
maintain for long-term use learn more at
the link below the discussion here is
actually really complicated genuinely it
is it is a very complex topic to get
into things of airflow in a case to
begin with and then you start trying to
normalize fans in cases with different
air flow paths fans that are rare cases
that are designed for different fans and
you might be putting in there cases that
do better with negative versus positive
pressure setups and they do exist so
it's it's genuinely a very difficult
topic to tackle and the reason that we
haven't done these tests despite getting
requests from viewers for years is
because we know there are a lot of flaws
and doing them but there's absolutely
validity to the requests of
standardizing a set of fans and the
Patrick's credit who does most of our
testing for cases these days and the
rights the build section it Patrick made
a point to me which was well if a lot of
people are requested it we really should
explore it and I completely agree so
we're gonna do that what we're going to
do first is I'll talk through the
scripted section here about the testing
method in some brief detail there will
be more in the article linked to the
description below and then we'll talk
about the result
those tests and then please stick around
for the conclusion because I'll talk
through some special scenarios that this
testing will not work for or that your
next suggestion following this might not
work for so stick around for that part
of the video so that's I'm going to try
and boil down years and years of case
reviews we we have in our spreadsheet we
have over 200 results like rows in our
case review for one of the tables one of
them and we published something like
four or five charts before these so
hundreds if not approached in a thousand
rows of data on cases over the past
several years and to try and compress
this down is a great disservice to what
we've done but I'm going to do my best
to try and remember some of the key
points that you need to keep in mind in
case you haven't seen every case review
we've ever done which is completely
valid so first of all a few things
problems with the standardized case fan
placement testing we've listed a few of
them today let me first start by saying
it is still a valid idea we are glad
that those of you who pitched it have
pitched it and done so repeatedly and
we're probably going to keep doing this
kind of testing at least for the
foreseeable future because it can teach
us a few things for example in the
fractal measure if I see it further
demonstrates how the fans are sort of
biased up towards the CPU which benefits
the CPU greatly but doesn't help the GPU
as much so that's something valuable
that we can learn from that testing but
there are a lot of things wrong with it
too and the NZXT h 500 is just the tip
of the iceberg on that we're in c b
results you see a big improvement but in
GPU results you see that stock was
better and that's because this isn't
that case but in that case you actually
end up with the stock negative pressure
set up here pushing there that way and
this way it sucks in air through
everywhere else in the case so you get a
natural pull through the front because
of the negative pressure set up but also
and critically through places like the
bottom so you pull some air up through
the bottom that ends up in the video
card you actually pull some air through
the back through the PCIe slots and
through the grills in that area that
benefits the video card so the video
card has effectively front panel access
to air because that's as far as it cares
that's what this is this is the back of
the case this is a PCIe area but as far
as the video card carries it might have
whole be the front of the case with
clean air that's cold and while
relatively cold and that's because all
the exhaust is pushing up and back and
so the air will go in everywhere else it
can as soon as you change that to a
positive pressure setup what you're
doing is you're forcing the hot air out
the back and that means you're not
pulling cool air through the back where
it was originally so the results and the
H 500 get worse now that's fine as long
as we and this is our job
in the review side of things as long as
we clearly highlight what's happening we
explain why it's happening and hopefully
most of the people watching will will
watch that part and catch you didn't
understand what's going on now part of
the challenge we face in terms of
responsibility of reporting is that the
viewer attention graph and it will be
true for this video as well look
something like this and as you drop to
30 40 % viewership towards that into the
video potentially a lot of people are
missing explanations and then those are
the same people who often go around and
post things on forums out of context and
mislead everybody or provide
misinformation so we have to be really
careful about that and that's one of our
greatest hesitations to doing the
standardized fantastic because it's very
likely at some point probably today when
this video goes live people will share
the information that they think they've
learned without sharing the caveats
which might include things like hey this
standardized test setup is actually
worse than stock for this specific
scenario for GPU in this case of the H
500 so we still learn some really cool
stuff it's a good test it should stay in
the testing it's just that we at GN have
to be very careful to explore why the
results are what they are and then make
the distinction in the reviews is it
because the case is good that it happens
this way is it because the case is bad
that it happens this way or is it
neutral and it's just because we've
modified how the case was designed to
perform a lot of cases don't really get
that kind of design where they smartly
try to do something like a negative
pressure setup
actually works or where they try to
guide the airflow in t specific areas to
cool specific components a lot of time
you get a very simple case like this one
the Versa j24 where their approach was
let's put holes in the front
let's put holes in the back and then
let's put fans in the holes pretty
simple
front to back airflow so in these
instances doing the standardized test
can actually benefit us a lot because
what we learn from this case is that
switching to the standardized fans
improves the performance what does that
teach as well what it teaches us is that
these fans and it sort of validates what
we already thought we knew which it's
always good to validate what you think
you know it validates that these fans
are not particularly good for static
pressure performance and they're not
particularly strong either and the CFM
is a bit lower so you end up with the
scenario where fewer better fans
outperforms more low unfenced and that's
valuable to learn from that testing a
couple other things we've explained this
a lot in the past but for those of you
who may not have seen it there's an
important item of note with the top of a
case in a good amount of cases this is
this kind of getting into a quagmire to
it there's a lot of different like
rabbit holes we can go down but in a lot
of cases you can do things like put a
fan on the top and if you put the fan on
the top front and you do intake top
front being the front most position of
the top and you do intake it will often
actually improve the CPU thermals a lot
of people this is an old thing we've set
on the channel for years now a lot of
people like to do the whole well but hot
air rises okay yes it absolutely does
but the increase in molecular speed is
about four percent for every 25 degrees
Celsius you climb so the thing is when
when hot air rises it sort of made
irrelevant when you look at blasting the
air with a 2,000 rpm fan or a 1400 or a
thousand rpm fan it doesn't matter the
point of the matter is that a fan moving
out some rpm greater than zero is going
to move more air than just hot air
rising you can make hot air go down you
can make hot air rise you can
Hodder go vertically it doesn't matter
if you have a fan blowing at a higher
rpm than the air is naturally moving
it's sort of irrelevant now it's not
completely irrelevant so don't think
that out of context of course it matters
to some degree which direction air
naturally moves and how physics dictates
the movement but the point that we're
getting to is that if you put a fan here
in a lot of cases but not all of them
and you do intake it will improve the
CPU thermals and that has nothing to do
with hot air rising it is entirely to do
with the fact that up here is air that
is colder than in here that's all it is
ambient temperature outside is anywhere
from five to maybe ten fifteen and the
really bad cases like the and so but
five to 15 degrees often five to ten
degrees cooler than the inside ambient
temperature of the case we've measured
some of these cases in a room ambience
of twenty one to be upwards of forty and
that's for the really bad ones again
like the ENSO but in general we see
something like thirty so because this
air is colder and because this fan is
blowing in and because the intake for
this fan is immediately adjacent to the
intake for the CPU tower obviously the
cool air will go straight through the
tower and that's gonna be your coldest
source of air so the points then this
doesn't work on all cases and of course
in a lot of cases to putting exhaust in
the top would be better especially in
larger or longer cases where you can do
an exhaust behind the CPU cooler and
push air up after it comes through the
cooler that might be beneficial too so
there's a lot of really screwy things
you can do with cases once you start
adding more and more fans and it's very
possible that you make the performance
worse and so the point of saying that is
if we try to expand too much with a
standardized fan tested we are going to
make the performance words in a lot of
cases or it can't be standardized it's
one or the other so if we start picking
and choosing where the fans go it's no
longer exactly standardized so we pick
the the positions that will be present
in basically every case make the most
sense in basically every case should
produce the same performance in terms of
how they scale against each other in
basically every case and beyond that
what we're going to do is keep testing
these on isolated charts against only
the case itself before getting to the
comparative charts and look at
individual test cases of what if we had
one fan would have to remove the filter
things like that so another
if you do a lot of people have suggested
this where when we said we don't want to
do standard fan placement people have
often said well why don't you just fill
the case of fans every slot
it'll probably it doesn't really teach
us a lot for one but it's probably going
to be worse and that's because you get
again into situations of like noise
versus thermals and then you further get
into situations of if okay we put
exhaust on the top now what's going to
happen is the air will come in the front
to this top fan and it will be pulled
out right away by the top exhaust fan
before after hitting the CPU so you can
make things worse and I'm not saying
that these things are true for every
single case if you're posting an
anecdote in the comments about how your
case does something different that's
fine it's probably true even although
it's hard well but it might well be true
and I guess that's the whole point isn't
it is that this can change on a case to
case basis applauded for that pun and so
as a result of this it's very very
difficult to properly standardized in a
meaningful way we think we've done a
pretty good job of it clearly the most
important thing is to just explain the
results and make sure we understand
what's going on and communicate with
viewers what's going on
when they're making a purchasing
decision because otherwise people can
get confused and they might see a result
with stock performs and go where I was
that better than the better fans and
it's because well maybe the case came
with more fans came with better fans
better fan positions for the most part
these results we saw improvements in the
CPU section so that's what we want to
see because that says we're doing
something that actually has some value
we originally disagreed with the idea of
standardizing a set of fans or case
tests for reasons that will become
partially clear in our GPU results
section but it remains the single most
requested test in every single case
review we've posted we recognized the
merits of potentially adding this test
and ultimately we take great pride in
expanding and improving by listening to
community interests for this testing
we're using to Noctua NFA 14 fans in the
front with one nff 12 in the rear it is
of critical importance that anyone
attempting to do this controls where
each individual fan is placed even
though we're using two of the same model
fan on the front we have marked which
one goes in the top slot and which one
goes in the
or of the two front slots this is
because fan rpm varies by plus or minus
ten percent from unit to unit so blindly
switching can drastically impact results
in a way that creates wide error margins
being blind further to these important
differences in fan speed could lead a
tester astray when analyzing the results
you could potentially make claims that
aren't true if you randomly swapped
which was where we control where each
fan is placed and always placed the
120-millimeter option in the rear slot
we noted that almost every single ATX
case we test has at least two 1:40 front
positions and one 1:20 rear position
unfortunately in some cases this means
reducing the fan count but we can't test
with more or we begin to enter scenarios
that eliminate most cases from testing
by way of insufficient fan mounts in
those cases we must also note that just
fill in a case with fans even if not at
random although a lot of people seem to
really do that when they build computers
just filling a case with fans though
even if you think you kind of have an
idea that makes sense can actually make
things way WAY worse and we'll talk
about this more later in the on-camera
segments at the end of the day it's
important for us to continue doing
one-off testing per case not
comparatively just against itself like
our panelists tests and our tests where
we add one fan as a user might do when
buying just one extra fan with the case
still though these standardized results
can teach us about some of the case
designs it's not as simple as lowest
temperature means best airflow in the
case because the case might actually be
better in its stock configuration we ask
that you please exercise your brain and
actually think about the results and why
they are what they are we'll do our best
to explain them as we go but don't just
look at the chart and then post all over
reddit about how X is better than Y
because one chart is not sufficient to
make such a claim especially since it
exits the stock configuration we've had
this problem in the past when people
request tests anyway it's still useful
and can teach us a lot so let's get into
those results standardized fan results
are up first
we split these into two bars per case
one representing these standardized
results and one representing the full
stock results a quick glance reveals one
immediate apparent outlier although it's
not one and that's the BitFenix end so
getting this one out
the way first note that both these
standardized and the stock results were
up against CPU throttling so this is
actually an identical result between the
two the CPU is throttling so we can't
see the actual true temperature because
the frequency is shifting around in a
less predictable manner
further we previously proved that
BitFenix and it's and so will
recirculate its own hot air when
installing fans in the front which you
can learn more about an hour and so
review we're seeing some of that here so
that's it's one of the reasons that this
is among the worst cases we've ever
reviewed moving on from this the NZXT
age 500 sees the most immediate benefit
from standardizing the fans and the cpu
test but this will change later for the
GPU is asked the aged 500 saw an
improvement of about 9 degrees celsius
for air forced straight through the CPU
tower cooler the mesh device seeds and
the best here and by looking at the
verse of j24 is results we can learn
part of why the mesh if I see and the
versa j24 are the smallest of the cases
on these charts and positioning the
front fans closer to the components does
benefit the cooling of those components
so being smaller in this instance is
beneficial to results the impact of
performance is noticeable in some ways
and the higher velocity air is
dissipating heat more quickly off of
that large tower cooler atop the CPU
second to both cases have relatively
punched through front panels allowing
for more airflow than in some of the
competition the s2 vision doesn't change
a whole lot which isn't surprising when
considering its four stock fan
configuration and the NR 600 sees some
improvement in results a Seuss's
heliosphere mains nearly identical which
is a testament to how much it was really
not impressive in the cpu cooling
department but the GPU department
changes things the standardized fan
results for GTO temperature are much
more interesting they're more varied and
take some additional thought to
understand and you do have to look at
the cases to look at the positioning of
the fans but they do make sense once
explained and explored
let's start with an obvious one the NZXT
age 500 sees worst GPU thermals in this
configuration than in the original
benchmark and posts the opposite scaling
from what we saw with our noteworthy CPU
thermal improvement previously this is
for a few reasons that were detailed in
our original age 500 review first to the
HP
100 is configured in a negative pressure
set up for out-of-the-box thermals
testing which means that air finds its
way through every single hole in the
case this includes small perforations in
the front of course but critically
includes the rear PCIe slot covers and
grilles are holes in the back of the
case near the GPU the GPU fans are
therefore able to actually pull air in
through an immediate access to cool
ambient external air or ambient
temperature anyway right from the back
of the case it's as close to the GPU as
you can get closer than the front where
the air is coming from by switching to a
positive pressure setup we take this
away that set of holes in the back now
becomes exhaust and the H 500 loses its
highlight and also highlights a
potential shortcoming in this section of
test methodology because the case exits
an optimal configuration at least for
this build
it is perhaps unfair to test in this way
we can see CPU performance uplift but
GPU performance decay so it's important
to try and keep these factors in mind so
that you can judge the case fairly and
not just look at one chart and make a
conclusion from that regardless the NZXT
age 500 does worse here despite actually
holding a top 3 results when under its
stock conditions noting that these
results are very limited right now and
that's represented by the red bar moving
on the NR 600 does well in this test
which is entirely result of the weird
positioning in this case then our 600
claims it supports 140 millimeter fans
in the front but it really doesn't
properly do so as discussed in the
review that said the upside for this
case was that the fans ended up directly
benefiting the GPU despite being very
oddly placed because they don't fit in
those holes those were 120 s but there's
still screws for 140 s and if you mount
multiple of them well you end up with
the weirdness we saw on the review it
all comes down to positioning though the
J 24 in the Helio signed up in the same
area though we should note that the
Helios actually did very well overall
for its geothermal results in the
initial review the master for IC isn't
as impressive here which is because the
fans end up biased towards the CPU the
GPU receives more air across its
backplate than the front of the card
which doesn't amount to much aside from
better CPU cooling the s2 also sees
worse thermal results with standardized
testing as it includes for fans
in the stock configuration and those
aligned better to heavily direct airflow
under the GPU shroud this set of tests
illustrates again shortcomings in just
standardizing fan placement in size even
when you think about what to do and
where to put them because some cases are
simply built or equipped better out of
the box and we can't have one standard
set up for every single case that
doesn't screw some cases over while
making others look better so you're just
going to have to do your best to bear
with us through more in heart charts as
we add three views we can't go too high
in fan count because we then eliminate
the ability to standardize for smaller
cases making this difficult to do so and
again at some point you do start making
things worse for example if you start
putting top exhaust fans in you very
well may end up pulling air away from
the CPU cooler before the cool air ever
gets there thus making it much worse
than if you just left those top slots
unpopulated and allowed the air to move
naturally so more discussion on this
later let's move on to the noise
normalized results we've been running
noise normalized tests in our CPU cooler
reviews for over two years now so
there's certainly nothing new for gamers
Nexus we introduced these tests when we
realized that CPU coolers were lacking a
critical component for the reviews and
this was probably 2016 or around them
that we made this this addition to the
CPU testing so the difference the
important thing was to illustrate
performance when controlling for the
variable of noise it's not very fair if
a cooler performs the best on the charge
by simultaneously being the loudest as
you could have a cooler at 60 DBA that
beats everyone else's 45 or 40 or 36 DBA
coolers one measured at 20 inches away
but that doesn't count for much because
well it doesn't mean a lot when one is
much louder what counts is how well our
hypothetical 60 dB a cooler does in the
situation one level does the same noise
level as everyone else that shows the
efficiency of cooling as opposed to just
brute force cooling so we normalize for
40 dB at 20 inches in our cooler testing
system this is in a room the same room
is the case test system although they
are tested in isolation one is off when
the other is on and that's with the
noise floor about 26 DBA for cases it's
the same story if someone wins and
thermals by being loudest but the two
results are isolated on different charts
it
hard to quantify and illustrate the
actual difference between cases with
different strengths we first
demonstrated this with cases in our be
quiet review where we or the follow-up
where we looked at it versus the are l06
and that we can show on the screen now
as well we found in the chart for the RL
0 6 vs. to be quiet case that the better
ventilated RL 0 6 was able to outperform
to be quiet case in not just thermals
but also acoustics the thing that it
claims to do best this was because the
RL 0 6 could run its fans slower and
draw more air in at lower noise as a
result of its match whereas the be quiet
case had to run its fans faster to
overcome its own noise damping material
and the creating worst results for both
for these tests today we're measuring at
36 DBA at 20 inches away from the front
of the case the rest of the testing uses
our standard torture test with
controlled power consumptions by the CPU
and the GPU for the whole test and the
20 inch measurement is one we chose ages
ago because that's about the distance
just from polling we did several years
ago that we think the average user sits
away from the front of their case so
it's just it's a number chosen based on
a an assumed realism for the scenario
the noise normalized results are on the
screen now for these the only outlier in
the performance scaling is the Helios
which breaks pattern with a stronger GP
performance than the other cases this is
due to the positioning of the fans as we
learned before in the review and because
of the quantity of the fans note that
we're back down to the stock fan
configurations just tuned for 36 DBA the
Versa j24 doesn't make this chart as its
front fans cannot be controlled and so
it's noise levels can't be reasonably
normalized for these results the cooler
master and our 600 does the best thanks
to its ultra fine mesh front CPU
performance that leads all other cases
that we've tested thus far and it is a
limited list to be fair the master 5c
comes in next followed by the s2 vision
and it's full assortment of fan spun
down to the targeted noise level the
Helio sleeves every one in GPU
performance but not in CPU and then so
is doing what it does best throttling
very very hard
the takeaway then this was largely a
viewer request we are going to continue
doing these tests the noise normalize
one is
the most interesting or useful one going
forward because it allows us to isolate
the final variable between noise and
temperature and pick one and then say
okay how efficient are they at cooling
at a given noise level and then we can
really really start exploring things
like acoustic focused cases versus
airflow focused cases although you start
getting into questions at that point of
frequency spectrum and maybe that's a
future topic so there's a lot more we
can do here
of course frequency spectrum included
but hopefully this gives you a starting
point and finally thank you for the
suggestion sincerely we do like we do
like to try and incorporate things like
that and improve because if we don't
change what we're doing we don't improve
today then you start falling behind and
becoming irrelevant and we obviously
don't want to do that so we're very much
open to your suggestions these were good
ones just wanted to be very careful
about pointing out some of the ways
cases behave so that people don't have
illusions about what to expect so that's
it for this one thank you for watching
that you were suggesting veins
