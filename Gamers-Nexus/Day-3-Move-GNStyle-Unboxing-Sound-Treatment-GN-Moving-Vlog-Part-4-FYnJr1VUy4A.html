moving vlog now so this day involves a
lot of boxes we're gonna start filling
in some final stuff on the walls things
like that and we're gonna do our first
real unboxing the video make a genuine
effort at it I don't I don't usually
have any this is the deep cold frozen
guess they didn't change the name after
all so this doesn't go in the office
this goes back to get tested it's it's
in a MD cooler that we saw at CES and
it's named frozen which is a really good
name for a cooling device before that
this video is brought to you by thermal
takes view 37 case the vo 37 focuses on
highlighting custom PC builds with its
full panoramic window and tinted front
acrylic and our thermal testing the view
37 performed reasonably well when
considering its looks focused build
which is partly thanks to the airflow
design and the removal of a bottom power
supply shroud for a balance of looks and
performance check the link in the
description below for the view 37 it
doesn't really that's not really that
substantial let's try this one
that's pretty good
you know what we decided to just do an
unboxing tools benchmark there's not a
whole lot of these a lot of unboxings
but no one really goes in-depth on how
good the tools are so they're just gonna
finish up this unboxing is this how you
use these Keegan oh yeah patrick neas
for this app so for the first real work
we're doing today we're gonna swap the
cabinet in the fridge the fridge is
making just enough noise that it's
picking up in the testing room and it's
not a lot but it's enough to raise the
noise floor enough that I would rather
just have the noise floor be lower that
way we can do better noise testing so
we're gonna swap them and then I bought
some extra acoustic foam I'm just just
around the fridge with it in that corner
and hope that I hope that that doesn't
off I mean it's probably only raising
the noise floor by 2 decibels maybe 3 so
we're probably at 30 instead of 26 or
something and swapping them will fix a
lot of it and saranya and film will get
whatever's left over so I'm gonna swap
those one of the first orders of
business now that we have a place but
food and liquid was to actually get some
so let me go through these really quick
you'll see a behind the scenes GN snacks
and provisions for building a novel that
would put anything real in here yet
other than white fudge animal cookies so
next thing we're gonna do is I bought
some of this foam and this is it's
fairly soundproofing I can't remember
exactly how thick it is I want to say
it's less than a quarter inch maybe it's
it's something like that so this is
gonna go maybe an eighth of an inch I
think is what it is it's gonna go in
here and it'll just be straight up and
down
that's because there is some noise from
the hallway that just kinda like
bounced around in here so this will help
with dealing with some of the reverb
issues but the bigger thing is gonna
deal with is just like hallway noise
from a door opening and closing right
there so this should kill almost all of
that because there's a gap between the
window and the wall that's exactly the
thickness of this foam which is really
cool and I'm gonna put this on both
sides and then that that should pretty
much solve that problem so that's one of
our next tasks for just dealing with the
acoustics of the space so what are we
what are we doing right now so we are
soundproofing you've got one layer in
between the wall and the window here and
we're taking a second piece this square
piece and we'll just do that make it
nice
form-fitting should be a good seal and
it's gonna be way easier than trying to
get some adhesive in between the window
in the wall with this squeezed in there
because I don't think we're ever gonna
get the tape off and applied and then if
we need to remove it later
it'll be a massive pain in the ass yeah
so this is easier and probably a better
seal
yeah you can discuss my method of doing
this if you want in the comments but
it's already done so it doesn't matter
anyway so I got some silicon weather
like draft cards and this is just gonna
go at the bottom of the doors that go to
the hallway and it'll go at the bottom
of the door that goes to the testing
room at assirram specifically is going
to be sort of well pretty controlled for
noise we'll just have to turn all the
systems on from you test which we
already do today so no change there
we're gonna put these on both sides of
the doors and test rooms behind me right
there so it'll help just keep the noise
floor low low for that room my target is
26 decibels we're pretty damn close so I
think we can get there with with stuff
like this
there's a fairly thick silicon it's
multi-piece and that'll deal with a lot
of the noise especially if it's on two
sides and we've got the acoustic foam as
well that we can apply and we could do
some sound damping blankets in the
ceilings potentially I have to look into
some legality of that but that's
something we've considered I just I
don't know what code is so I look it up
worst case we get to hang it like
suspend it below the ceiling with like a
c-stand but I don't think we're gonna
have to do that that's my goal is to
avoid that because it's a huge pain and
I don't know how many different rules
I'm gonna have to look up to figure it
out and I think we'll kill on the
hallway walking noise and we'll just use
acoustic foam for the rest just kind of
scattered everywhere taking a and I
guess educated approach to it but not
like a scientific approach to the foam
because I'm not a sound control expert
not an acoustics expert but I think I
can apply it well enough to damp
everything to a point we're happy with
so and we can always just peel it off
and apply it again if we have to so I'm
sure there are people out there in the
audience who are like you're doing it
wrong I know all about noise control in
studios
I appreciate your expertise I don't have
those so if you actually know what
you're talking about and you're not full
of crap feel free to leave a
constructive comment so that I actually
pay attention to it and not a hostile
one and let us know if you in seen like
the space if you have specific
recommendations of where stuff should go
alright I'm gonna take my best guest
today and then if we have to peel it off
not a big deal so but let me know if you
actually know what the hell you're
talking about how as Keegan has observed
andrew has safety goggles on right now
part of our safety policy one of the
things we're thinking of doing for this
is could use it as a boom which we're
not gonna do is laugh it all season to
haul the GoPro above a livestream table
so if we want to top down top or just a
teardown shot we can use it for if we
orient the bar horizontally we can use
it so that the bar just holds up a sound
damping blanket in front of the set
behind the camera or in front of it a
bit and I think that's mostly use a hair
light hair or rim light we could mouth
up there as well I think that pretty
much covers it maybe a bounce card or
something like that to thinning out the
air thinning out the air yeah how's that
work make it thinner
that's what hammers do yeah so now we're
gonna replace some of the lights it's
all florescent in here you're gonna
start putting some LEDs in and for the
set area we're putting in some some more
true white LEDs and then we have a bit
bluer ones for the rest of the or
actually yellow or one so that's the
office it'll be like 40 100 K for all
the working areas and that's bit warmer
here maybe 5,000 or something like that
because it's the studio lights we have
basic math here so for the whole office
the all the lights right now as
fluorescent lights not LEDs as
fluorescent lights if we have all them
on it's about 2.1 kilowatts and if we go
to all LEDs the ones I'm buying at the
brightness I'm buying them it'll drop
that in half
cut it down to about a thousand kill or
one one kilowatt of thousand watts for
all of them actor that wants which will
result in based on how many hours we
typically will have them on should
result in anywhere from four hundred at
the low end to seven hundred fifty at
the high end of savings per year just by
switching to LEDs from fluorescent
because the it just it depends how many
hours we have them on but four hundred
at the low on for sure and it's also
it'll drive down cost elsewhere that's
less visible like we won't need to run
the AC as hard because the LEDs consume
half of the power as the fluorescent
tubes so AC won't have to run as hard
that drive down cost there but also
keeps the temperature more controllable
in here and I mean dropping a kilowatt
of power active use is pretty
significant so we're gonna replace those
probably keep around the fluorescent
ones just because there's really no
point getting rid of them if they're
perfectly good maybe I'll sell them
secondhand to someone or something like
that because kind of defeats the purpose
from an environment standpoint if you're
just throwing them away but also we can
reclaim some of the cost I think and
telly is gonna be way better for camera
two so that'll be nice to have so these
are five thousand camera to see how they
look
fifty six hundred is typically what we
use for our studio lights so this it's a
bit warmer than what we typically is
also so these lights are ballast
bypasses which means this is the ballast
is up here for the fluorescent tubes so
there's a ballast up there and you can
wire it so you can manually rewire it
cap one end and then bridge two of the
other wires together and that would
bypass the ballast these LEDs eliminate
that requirement it is harder to find
the really bright LEDs with a ballast
bypass built-in it's easier to get them
if you do the manual bypass but we're
going with
we're going with the built-in bypass
just make it easier and these are
actually pretty nice so these are twenty
three hundred lumens there's some of the
brightest ones I could find with a
built-in bypass and with the color
temperature I wanted I hit that switch
to see that's very bright
we still have fluorescence in that one
that's the one I just replaced so I
don't know how well the camera picks it
up especially for color correcting the
video maybe we can leave this clip for
our or something but pretty substantial
by eye if not by camera that step I
don't know that might be brighter as
well I'm not sure I think it's it's a
bit brighter definitely whiter though
this is kind of yellow and hasn't looked
great for video so we'll replace the
rest of these just immediately over the
set and then I'm going to order some
others for the rest of the office
unfortunately the first round I ordered
was pretty economical in terms of price
but if if they did arrive destroyed
destroy it to a point that even the UPS
refuses the shipment before we ever got
it off to reorder those
try that around the wall so that's
that's it for the first nine bulbs there
are I think they're like 70 something it
might be like 72 where you do something
like that so I replaced all the rest
later I need to order the 40 100 cables
again hopefully not destroyed this time
the most one pretty destroyed because I
think they're actually plastic housing
so I have no idea how they got broken
but anyway these look way definitely way
better in terms of like studio color
it's very close to what we use on our
LEDs to the light stands half the power
consumption at like 15 for its 14 to 16
watts I can't remember which it's
roughly 15 watts instead of 32 plus and
23 hundred lumens 5 5 K 5000 K so 5 yeah
5000 K for the color so pretty nice
we'll just we'll do the rest I think
probably the rest of this room might be
this economy temp return brightness buy
more of these and everything else we're
gonna do a slightly warmer color not too
warm but we 4100 K which in Andrews
comparative shots you'll see most the
like yellow weird color that's 3500 K to
give you an idea so 4100 K is fairly
white it's like a it's like a daylight
color and these are more of a studio
light color so it'll be everyone here
agreed basically that 4100 was the
nicest to work under so we're gonna put
those and like the production and
pastors at the end of day 2 that video I
showed how this had some like torsional
flex and it's been fixed so basically
just one of the support beams on each
side was longer than the other one and
then
around and out it's good so this all
supported now it didn't need to do any
fancy mods started labeling some of
these like small parts just spare parts
whatever batteries zip ties things like
that so that started but getting filled
in the whole place has been like vacuum
then cleaned and mostly emptied out
relatively clean it is now happens on
the foam yet so I'm waiting on another
36 foam blocks to come in in a couple
days and well like I said if you
actually know what you're talking about
and aren't talking out of your ass let
me know why I should believe you and if
you have suggestions on specifically
where in this room we should consider
placing foam let me know we'll consider
it right now I frankly I don't care if
it eliminates a ton of echo and reverb
or not but I'm considering this wall
because like it'll definitely help a
little bit
I mean I'm standing over there and
projecting across the whole room it's
gonna hit the ceiling or off the
ceiling and the floor and all that stuff
- something will get to the wall though
and also it's not gonna it's not gonna
hurt anything it'll look cool anyway
because blue and black so whether or not
it does a ton I'll probably put some
there just cuz it looks cool and then as
for the rest we have some base traps
I haven't really thought too much about
where to put those yet we have phase
traps we've got foam panels started
putting some foam up around the fridge
just to deal with refrigerator noise we
swap the sides of bridges on so that
helps with
the testing room over there so that will
basically kill the noise from the fridge
so we don't have to worry about it
during testing and I'm waiting on a
couple more of the black foam tiles come
in just doing every other one patterning
it diagonally and it should should help
quite a bit
Plus moving the fridge to the other side
of the kitchen so yeah now through the
wall in the testing room it really
shouldn't be that much noise so we'll
have a low noise floor maybe lower than
where we've been testing and that means
better noise testing accuracy in the
future then I did the same thing here I
did on the other door to put a door
guard or a draft guard down this one
drags intentionally so I mean it's
making full contact I'd put one on the
other side as well
help with the noise levels
this room has hasn't changed a whole lot
so it's still just to test benches for
other benches another table back there
in the corner so yeah we don't run any
equipment in yet but that we got this
room is pretty much good to go so for
this room we filled in these over here
that named Isis basically and we'll
figure out more specifically were they
going later but this seems pretty good
right now
production and test benches over here
and we also have it and had an Adobe
crash report pop up just while we were
working here just they just happen that
frequently at this point so also
replaced a lot of these on two three
four of the fixtures with 12 LED lights
so they're a 5000 K now we use 5600 K
and we're studio lights
they look way better than the yellowish
3,500 K and 4100 K were using before so
I mean yeah definitely way better for
color we'll get our studio lights in
later and then probably all this all the
lights and the vicinity of video will be
that color and then all the other lights
probably 4100 cages because they're
nicer to work under as opposed to fill
them under so different needs will be
addressed by different lights
we got the C stand built and we have
this dolly which is not so this goes on
our big tripod that we have that will
bring it eventually
technically they say it's not a donnelly
it's just for like relocating the camera
moving it which is why I bought it but
it is also labeled dolly it's literally
on the label even though they say it's
not as a Holly so we're gonna we're
pretty much looking forward to that a
lot just don't make it'll make
repositioning the camera way easier nice
to have that probably get this on wheels
if we can got a bunch of wheels for the
other light tripods and this C stands
just really nice like it's I know you've
seen probably Paul or the other guys
using these what this is the first time
we've had the space for one they're
about a hundred bucks
sorry twenty maybe and it's definitely
it's not that expensive considering the
other crappier tripods are like 50 bucks
so it'll be good for like mounting a
light here for example as a rim light or
flattening it so we're talking about
sound earlier and sound treatment well
part of our potential solution options
would be to flatten this then
and just get some clips and clip on like
a sound damn who's like it raise it up
put it flanking the camera on either
side and that would absorb a whole lot
of the echo and reverb issues before it
ever is picked up so that's a potential
solution as you can see stands for sound
damping blankets basically don't really
want to put them on the ceiling for a
number of reasons so not a great
solution but yeah so we've got a whole
room we can put sound treatment on if we
wanted to if you have specific ideas and
you know what you're talking about let
me know and we'll consider them
absolutely just you know give me a
reason to believe that you know you're
talking about because everyone on the
Internet is an expert when it comes to
audio specifically otherwise I think
this will deal with a lot of it just put
it down there a damping blanket on it if
we want to not really worried about
noise overall we'll be using a lab and
we have options to damp it and it's
gonna have a whole bunch more stuff in
it soon so that will absorb or diffuse
noise accordingly and I think is that
all of it I think that's pretty much all
of it
so yeah just waiting on more foam and a
couple of other things to come in but
most of the furniture is done at this
point if not all of it
and our just waiting on a few more
housekeeping things before we can
properly move in and start using the
space we also finally got the window
pretty much danced with foam so stuck
some foam in between the window and the
wall and doubled it up
cool it hit it together it's easy to
remove but it's it's creating a complete
seal so we'll have no more hallway noise
coming in and it also helped with some
of the like bounce back we were getting
from my own voice off the window behind
us and coming back in so that actually
resolves a lot of the outside noise and
we have a pretty low noise floor here
honestly it's about the same as the
house from the ACS off and AC on is not
that different either so no downgrade in
terms of noise and we're just working on
improving and now make it even better
but there's your update so comment below
as always thank you for watching
gonna store it on cameras nexus net to
pick up a shirt like this one or one of
our mod mats which are in stock and
shipping now for a little bit longer
took inventory the other day and if you
ordered
within the next week or so you should
definitely get one before the next
production run otherwise patreon.com
