I'll fix it it will be an interesting
one we're back with ten doing another
XOC lab video or just engineering lab
video in general for this one so this we
have you've got like a scope hooked up
of a current clamp and we're gonna show
is impacts of things like load line
calibration on power consumption and
impact of the or actually the
measurement difference between like a
software voltage measurement for GPU
voltage and then an external voltage
measurement before that this video is
brought to you by Dollar Shave Club and

convenience is key and care packages can
be scheduled to send when you need a
restock go to dollarshaveclub.com slash
gamers nexus or click the link below to
learn more yeah that's one of the
reasons why we implemented so much
controls on the kingdom card so like you
can play and find the best setting which
fits your specific case you specific
game or the benchmark so it's not
limited to only one setting which would
be for everything and so it's it's gonna
be a dense video with a lot of
information but this is it's it's some
good technical insights to the cards
we'll have a separate video on the
physical hardware side of things like
what tin does to get the cards up to the
level that they can eventually advance
them into like a KP design or something
like that yeah pretty much some pieces
on or oversimplified piece of the cloud
we'll go through the design of the vrm
and make the custom PCBs including like
erm design and stuff like that ok so
what is this demo going to be what are
we showing oh that will show the load
line difference and actually how the
power is consumed by the cart when the
bench
who's running okay so I'll have the
precision x1 open we can see the current
GPU clock it's just running on
essentially no overclocking and then all
the power is maxed out and memory is not
overclocked so we can see the GPU
temperature and we can see their power
on the drum from 12 volt from using this
big program clamp yep see okay so what
are we let's talk about each of the
lines here so which line should be
looking at right so essentially there
are three lines here we have voltage the
Purple Line and then we have the yellow
that is the current from this probe okay
but to get the power we actually need to
multiply voltage by current and that's
what the scope is doing and this is the
red line so we have read out this is the
RMS power so this is more like average
RMS current average setting and then we
have the red that is reported kakuhen
power so there are two values one is
maximum one is RMS maximum is the peak
power and then RMS is average all right
so right now we're just idling yeah well
I then and because this is XOC bias we
don't want to have power capping for
this illustration so you we can see the
power and is actually quite high so it's
90 watts RMS and when we start the
benchmark and the benchmark is 3dmark
times pi just gt1 test but the similar
happens with any benchmark just the
different levels okay
and that's something we've noticed with
times pi extreme for example when i was
really desperately trying to get more
power out of just chilled your cooling I
would do hot key is for increasing the
frequency based on the low level of
benchmark at a time yep and so for that
we kind of noticed that with like gt2
there's certain scenes where you'll see
the power consumption spike maybe 40
watts or something like if you actually
really
engine for the best score you will have
the voltage and frequency can apply in
the using the profile in the precision
so you can actually run one one part of
the benchmark with the one level and
then another part of the benchmark with
different frequency and voltage levels
so that's why you can maximize your
score in the benchmark but like
especially when you're running nail and
- you need to handle their own -
container and you need to apply the
settings right time and all from there
if you apply the settings then the
benchmark and catch it and will crash
out back into the windows yeah you
cannot have it for every benchmark right
so what what types of what's happening
in the benchmark I guess or what kind of
load has been applied to the GP where
you do see those spikes it like
indicative of an increase in memory
utilization or well the power will take
your measuring here is 12 volt input so
this is essentially the complete power
taken by GPU and by the memory to get
okay but most of the country abuser is
of course GPU memory I would say maybe
like 20 percent will have total power
that goes to them we're looking at a
power before the VR MT with the clamp
yes yes so there is also if efficiency
effect from the vrm itself so like which
in the modern vga card can run around
90% efficiency so 10% actually power is
dissipated into heat by the vrm
controller and there is also some drop
on the traces but that would be like
couple percent when the power is
delivered from the RM point to the GPU
die itself right so right now we are
running with the load line at default so
we can check that level 10 that's the
default pre-programmed voltage and the
power region is around 420 watts
okay maximum and then around 300 watts
in the average so I can stop this
capture and we can actually see you can
guess like the waveform is very
repetitive yeah like it's you can almost
count actually how much FPS you have
running the benchmark
just looking at the power that's why I
like using the scope for this kind of
measurement is very good illustration as
if you just use the mm you see all just
the number which is average and yeah and
see what's the peak or what's the low
power that yeah what's what is the
waveform look like that actually making
the number you see on the screen and
when you run the benchmark which is have
lighter load then of course this
frequency will be faster as well and
that the peak and transient of change in
the power will be faster so like it's
important to test on both low loads and
silos right so look at 430 watts or 300
average and this was with the default
levels and we can also run it again to
take a look on the bow of the
temperature 2080 I can pin card so
you're able to turn it a bit yes we have
extra controls we can flood play with
the load line we can play with the
different erm settings to find you own
not too much power so not too much heat
and also enough voltage for GPU to run
the maximum frequency we can get and the
power is important because it have
direct correlation to the temperature
GPU is heaven so like we can see like
idle is 33 see this is all : one water
cooler is essentially the same as
containership whatever just no cover and
we can keep an eye on the three the hit
run I get honest pretty leave it a
paused run it so the power is about the
same and temperature goes like 40 C this
is xoc by so the frequency is bit lower
but we can see like this locate like
around 40 C and we can see how the
changes with the different load line so
I can run much slower time scale so we
can actually see that
in the like recording view so you have
the power current the yellow is the
current and then when the benchmark
stops you go I see I don't condition and
then when it start again but let's say
we use load line level 4 so that was
level 10 yes level 10 is the default
settings for kingpin card we can run the
same test again and then just to clarify
for the audience the closer you get to
zero I guess the more aggressive the
load lines yes zero essentially GP you
will get what you set the voltage if you
measure directly at the voltage stands
points if you measure at the pro point
from the connector on the PCB it will be
still small difference and we will talk
about that in a minute later okay so we
had for DC before and will run little
bit longer so go back to the fest scale
so we can see the power
and it's 416 465 and 308 305 around 300
Watts right
average temperatures it'll be hard for
you to see Parkinson's a lot higher yep
it's 475 320 so it doesn't look like
much but actually when you do if you
overclock higher and especially when you
apply current voltages you will see much
bigger difference so the only thing
that's changed between this test and one
we just did just the world LLC okay
and we already free CD cover and we came
down for us
okay so we came down from all ten to
whoever 404 so that's a pretty immediate
impact then that's that's very
noticeable and then we can do the same
thing with level zero run the same test
so there are for every piece of silicon
be GPU or CPU like there are three main
factors that affected them linked
together that's the power temperature
and the voltage so if you have changed
even one of the conditions then two
others will change as well so that's why
even if you if we chill this GPU to
let's say zero C using the liquid
nitrogen container the power will be
also lower even to the same load not
same is same voltage right straight like
480 now 480 watts
yeah it's 40 like 490 Peaks 488 494 and
we are running level zero now and then
you also see the different little bit
different so on their power depends on
what part of the benchmark is running
right but some pieces of the benchmark
actually stressing more on the shaders
other piece may be like using our TX
course this is the not the our TX
benchmark not the Port Royale but
there's still a lot of different units
inside the GPU that work together
differently so we are up to a 500 watt
peak and power was I see like three
hundred twenty watts or so for average
yeah and then we're around 40 40
if we set voltage to the fixed level say
1.2 then the card should down okay
because I didn't for doing this recipe
so we just yeah we just had a V V DD o
CP I guess that was okay so we can just
set the reference line okay easier to
see compare the difference between the
load line at aha okay this will be so
the line a zero our zero reference and
then the B is twenty three point seven
amps so you will need to multiply that
by 12 to get their power you so the
benchmark is over and now I can save to
level zero
so you can actually see like different
parts of the benchmark like right Bart
changed I store in slow mode now that
way we can actually see differences yeah
they're all this one block is twenty
seconds so the whole screen would be
around hundred seconds so and you can
see already power and a much higher
level zero is such a good illustration
and so that was that level 10 versus
zero yes okay
and so we're at your reference line is
twenty three point seven for B yes and
then there we go and power now has
become thirty-seven the current reading
is around thirty seven point two so
that's just from the word line and then
the money temperature right 27 yeah is
that important to it that's pretty big
increase so a little under four amps
increase just from changing only the LLC
nothing else
yep because what happens is when you
change the LLC their real voltage that
the river to GPU is changes as well and
when you have more voltage you have more
heat more power because this line is
zero what okay and then we have the
first test which load line 10 that was
284 watts and then the in the end on
which benchmark it dropped to like 263
watts that is Error error Marion so
that's not t Caribbean because we on
this scale we don't see the peak
readings it's like too small to raise
what the peak reans starter just follow
the same trend or is there any more
significantly they happen very fast and
very short so they will be actually you
will have much higher in much lower but
in average like you can like scale them
up so in the peak with the load line 0
was 340 watts so we have difference
between 280 and 300 for trite which is
also putting you closer to like if
you're working with a car that has power
limits
yeah then it that's a consideration of
if you start lowering the load line or
tighten or you know run a more
aggressive load line yes your power you
will run into the power limit earlier
and your frequency will be actually
lower and that's why what you see in the
end result as the lower benchmark score
rank you would expect like okay I have
more voltage more frequency but the
score is worse right one of the reasons
okay that's another reason why we are
running actually xoc bias which doesn't
have the power limit because we tallow
us to just see the effect of the load
line readout being kept by the power
right because otherwise we would see
different load line but the power is the
same because it's all to be limited by
the bias and driver settings I think I
can show one short thing it has
essentially take the reading on the card
like because even like on the GOC form
we see like some people as connect the
DMM to the probit connector and they see
difference between readout on the DMM
without in the precision and also
without in the other muharram or
injuring tool like right hardware info
or gpu-z and like why why is that and i
was where it comes from right so you
want to do a manual measurement for that
yeah so could my proper riser does the
real high speed one which like certified
and everything for that which are
expressed yes shielded coax wire I know
there's like 3m ones are supposed to be
the best or something like yeah well
this is this is a real deal this is
actually 3m is actually very good and
there for the PCIe gen3 that will be
like the one which I would recommend to
reasonably-priced I would say like
around 100 USD if you use by 16 right
and this one is around like 350 so this
is the same tag what is it Sam tag
company they specialized on high speed
interconnects like the backplane
connectors for those plates over oh how
hard is it to clamp like the PCIe sorry
the the 12-volt lines coming out of the
Reiser just like split them out yeah a
lot of the clampers yes essentially I
would need to do the same as here so I
have the ground bypass just go directly
to a cart and I connect only the 12 or
wire so maybe we can actually talk about
that a second okay
essentially they've had their current
measurement works use the big clamp
probe you can buy this is the probe for
the scope it's rated 450 amps but there
are also like DMMs which made like a
clamp so the the probe this progress for
the scope it's designed to interface and
readout with the current with the high
speed so that's why it's like so bulky
and big right now a clamp in the five
volts in that you are just 12 no this is
just 12 volts okay three cables from the
power supply I say to the card okay and
like if you want to have hundred percent
accurate measurement for the power we
would also need to help clamp the 12
volt coming from the PC East London but
because on the KP card the power input
is not drawing much power for the sake
of the demo we mean gray otherwise I'll
need to cut this wire and run through
the clamp as well or you use another
clamp connect to the second channel of
the scope to measure the board so what
what I want to show here is how the
voltage changes depends on what settings
we applied so we have the reading from
the precision which is this GPU voltage
it reads 1.17 2 volts this is we're just
idling the 3d mode and then we applied
1.15 to the erm controller and I have
the DMM cooked to the probit connector
this is just reading m dv/dt doesn't
read anything else so we read around one
point one three four okay
and what what is the okay so one point
one three four versus one point one
seven five and one point one seven three
and it's all supposed to be the same
thing ultimately it's just different
places of being measured correct
so the difference comes from how the
measurement is done so Riggin which we
see in the precision is taking by the
hardware monitor and it pretty close to
the GPU die itself and that's like a
reason why we see the higher voltage
because controller compensate for the
voltage draw up on the PCB and on the
GPU connection and we see essentially
voltage closer to what's what's actually
GPU getting and reading from the DMM is
little bit lower as it reads from the
vrm side okay and satan is somewhere in
between because we are just idling and
its effects also for the load line so
the setting is just fixed value for no
matter what now yep right so if i run
the same benchmark three mark times by
gt1 then we can see how this voltage is
also change I have illustrated the
differences in OSI guide for the kingpin
card mmm it's public on the X - comm
kite section so there are little bit
more details on that gt1 and window mode
and we'll keep an eye on our voltages so
what's the the most realistic or
practical way to get an accurate voltage
measurement like out of all these
numbers what do you trust most DMM or I
will trust the current the reading from
the precision okay
because actually we spend some time to
fine tune and make sure that voltage as
close as GPU actually gets as possible
so what does the fine tuning only apply
to the EVGA cards I mean if I plugged in
some other card I think it applies
universally but like the level how much
effort is actually engineers put into
that aspect is very what because you
like in the normal condition for the
everyday
user or gamer like you don't really care
about my voltage is 0.1 percent of what
is right so you don't even know the
voltage most of the time because you
don't you cannot monitor it easily on
the reference cards there are no like
yes you can connect the probes manually
probe the point but you also get the
different voltages from depends where
you measure them like right now we are
reading the benchmark is running and
we're reading zero point one zero five
and you can see the voltage in precision
actually fire yes we've gone between
well that's so going back to idle still
3d clocks I guess but idle 1.13 and then
when it was running it was like one
point one or one point as your five one
one zero five and that is with level ten
so we have the most blood lead rope now
and we can change the load linings you
have the changes as well so you will see
less difference in the voltage change
from the precision without them actually
from the DMR because EMM is more like
vrm centric and the reading the
precision is more actually representing
the type of course and check okay 11:23
1.05 on the DMM americans level zero and
i've gone twelve twenty ish and
precision and one point two five so
they're both the voltages goes up by one
point one two five because they're on
level zero we are actually over
compensate for that
so that'll cover us for the voltage
demonstrations that LLC demonstrations i
think ten was worried that we were
starting to look like two old men
sitting down so we decided to stand
again this definitely was not shot out
of order that would be weird
so thanks for watching the video
subscribe for more could have a chicago
