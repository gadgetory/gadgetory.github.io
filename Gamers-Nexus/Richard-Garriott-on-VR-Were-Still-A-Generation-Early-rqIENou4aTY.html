brought to you by saira power who make
the Fane book that we recently
overclocked past 4 gigahertz I think VR
is one of the most interesting things
happening right and in fact I would
describe myself as one of the pinnacle
dr enthusiasts but I'm also appear to be
one of the pinnacle VR skeptics I go
back you know even even in the early
stage like on the Apple to you know they
people made some simple VR goggles that
you know add a tiny view screen had
terrible lag and even dated gloves you
could wear you know even something
tenant endo way back I think you've made
a data glove and and every time one of
those come out we get really excited
about it and we convert whatever game we
were working on at the time we would
spend a couple of weeks making it work
in VR just because we just thought to be
so cool and as a demo even was cool but
every time you play with your going like
yeah but you know the lag is really
making me sick and the peripheral vision
is just not there and so to think of
actually playing a game that way you're
going it's not going to be and it's not
going to be a superior experience and so
every year these would come out every
few years somebody would make this round
and and we'd look at them and abandon it
right well obviously the latest round of
VR has gotten an enormous amount of
attention and investment and the
hardware is way way better and so we now
have VR hardware that is pretty dang
good you know not only is it really full
visual area the tracking and response
time is now very very quick and I go see
you Layton sees low I see demos now that
are going like that is a really cool
demo but I don't see very many things
I'm going like I would buy that game and
10 more like it that I can see 10
variations on the theme that will be
interesting to explore different ways in
which VR is being created or I go to
people's booths where they're
demonstrating VR and I watch them do
things like this one demo might be i'm
going to pick up something out of a bowl
and set it on a table or a shelf and I
watch them struggling
do that and I'm just going like yeah
okay well you know we're just not there
and and while I go some of these things
are fun I mean I I enjoy going booth to
booth and going like hey that was that
was cool that was fun but I haven't seen
the killer app not one much less 10 and
until there's 10 killer apps you're not
going to sell five hundred dollar or
better hardware and to get this to get
the technical solution you really need
to be selling me you know the the phones
in cases is cool and will be freely
available but doesn't have the wide
wraparound of you doesn't let you see
your own hands in front of you and so
you really need to be buying
multi-thousand dollar hardware to really
solve the problem and even with the
problem solved there's not yet the
killer apps so so I remain a huge
enthusiast and a huge skeptic but it's
at least for me I'm now to the point
where I am toying with trying to build
something only just not because i think
i can solve the problem necessarily but
because somebody needs to solve this
problem and and it's not that i don't
think they do people trying to solve it
or at least smarter may be smarter
especially in the VR area as I am but
it's at least interesting have to begin
to toy with right so that's what we've
we've done a lot of these demos as you I
mean you do the show as you know how
many there are that's the problem I've
had on the even just the editorial side
a lot of it's sort of you ever Everest
or the Star Wars down or their cool for
a few minutes and personally as a gamer
outside of the the gaming industry as a
reporter I don't necessarily see myself
going home going through the effort to
set it all up and then playing the demo
is more than a few times right or even
look like even if you skip games and
just go to more virtual reality say
experiences movies or other things there
is a
a fairly well-known movie maker whose
name is eluding me but he did it he shot
a VR sequence in a refugee camp I think
in Syria and and in that film I thought
he did a really great job of learning
exploring some new cinematography
techniques and what I mean by that is in
this little vr tour of this refugee camp
he had told everyone that with whose
faces he walked through don't ignore the
camera assume it's a person and as soon
as the person you would like to have an
engagement with and so if i was looking
towards you you'd be like waving at me
saying hey come check this out but if i
look over here there's somebody writing
buying a bicycle saying hey follow me
and you obviously can't look both ways
for any length of time but you felt
engaged in both ways and so I'm like oh
look that's it that's interesting but it
was just interesting you know main I'm
going like okay there's a new cinematic
technique they wouldn't be normal in a
normal film but it's only one piece of a
cinematic language it's just it's a step
and so I still think that there's you
know whether it's movies or games
there's a lot to learn from a the
language and activity to do and and even
I was to talk about something the
hallway a little while ago you know if
you know how would I approach in an
ultimate way AVR scene and I'm going you
know what I would want to do is I'd be
locked in a room and there's a sewer
grate and I'd want to get down on my
hands and knees and take a screwdriver
and pop the great off and then crawl
through that tunnel but I'm going hard
would be our Hardware won't let me do
that right is that it's not gonna
infinitely large space with track yeah
sorry exactly so there's so even the
first things that pop in my mind is what
I would like to do if I was really there
it still won't do and so it probably
won't do any time soon and so so yeah I
think it's I think I'm a little bit
stumped as to what the first great VR
experience will be what's your take on
of course you know Warren or inspector
he just told us a TCG see that he likes
to make statements that get people to
provoke them to argue with him
and he made the statement of VR is a fad
that was his his poll quote that was
posted everywhere do you have any
thoughts on that view it sounds like
you're more towards the middle well no
I'm actually closer to Warren uh you
know I am not convinced that the
billions of dollars that have been
poured into this generation of VR will
be paid back in this generation of
hardware and software development you
know eventually you know the matrix will
eventually be here or maybe we're living
in it now I mean right I mean it could
be you know so eventually we will have
sufficient technology to be
indistinguishable from reality and at
that point II of the we you know we will
be there it will happen but I'm not
convinced that we're as close as the
billions of dollars of investment would
imply sure right you know that's muddies
the waters a bit when there's so much
investing going on too because then
there's well there's tons of people
wanting to make a true right it's if
this generation of VR does not work it's
not for lack of effort or money because
you know there's a lot of that going
into it you know it's it's one of these
things where you know I mentioned my in
treatment with it you know in one way
one of mine treatments is if I'm wrong
you just want to be left too far behind
you know you're doing you're going like
I had a baby it would suck to like be
the naysayer in while it all happens and
by the way I've done that before you
know like I remember it's really funny
if you if you look at my prog nest like
prognostications for the future I'd say
my hit miss ratio is about 5050 at best
you know like and my first one was my
great my greatest lesson of in business
was you know I wrote my first games on
the Apple too and you might remember
that the first IBM PC that came out
wasn't a particularly great machine it
had a chiclet keyboard it didn't run
really particularly faster than an apple
at the graphics weren't any necessarily
any better had the IBM name on it but I
didn't care about that and and so when I
saw come out I was like well anybody who
knows this at all is clearly going to
pick an apple
and this PC things not going to work and
and so for software development which
you know we even back then it was taking
a year or two to make a game and so I
kept our development teams working
purely on Apple too and we'd probably
port to the pc if it ever became
relevant but then the pc took off so
fast and the Apple Apple to cratered so
fast that we realized we would have no
games to sell their we know market into
which to sell those games and we had to
completely change our staff over to pc
developers that was actually the last
time I programmed I never program on a
PC I never had time the only thing I'd
have time to do was quickly higher
Andrey managed to everything to get over
there before we ran into money it very
nearly put us out of business we my
brother and I both had to put on all the
money we had in the world and had to
borrow another couple million dollars to
keep the doors open to get i think was
ultima 5 out on time the only game ever
shipped on time because it was we were
to go out of business but didn't no
choice and and things were fine after
that but that was my big lesson of you
can't predict what the public's gonna do
you know well you have enough you can
have an opinion but you know but it's
groupthink and trying to predict
groupthink is fraught with peril but if
i had to make a stand I'm with Warren
this this we're still generation early
