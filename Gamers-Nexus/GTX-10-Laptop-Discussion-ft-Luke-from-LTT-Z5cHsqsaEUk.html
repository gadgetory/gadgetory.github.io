Donna I'm joined by Luke from Linus tech
tips hello and we're here at an Nvidia
event near London sort of outside of
London talking about laptops today so
before we get to that this coverage is
brought to you by Iowa power and the new
elements PC which has the large tempered
glass window so Luke we looked at the
1060 1070 the 1080 yep in laptops all in
laptops right they're not m's but the
1070 specifically is like kind of the
mobile version right because there are
some changes yeah so I think it had more
CUDA cores but at a lower that's right
yeah 2048 CUDA cores laptop and 1920 on
the desktop yeah the speeds lower it's
actually like a pretty significant
difference but the end result is
supposed to be within 10% give or take
depending on different games and
revocations and stuff yeah and and to
that sort of percentage there is
actually room for manufacturers to play
with like a factory overclock - ok yeah
that makes sense so we were talking
about a in the presentation earlier
looking at overclocking he was the
afterburner what they overclocked to is
like the 2060 - I think right on a 1080
right back over 2 gigahertz on a 1080
and I think there's only like 72 degrees
something like that 72 73 I think it's
somewhere around there yeah crazy
considering my Asus Strix back home got
almost 2k not quite and was like 76
degrees or something that's going off of
memory but that's pretty impressive
considering it's mobile right yeah so
we'll see like sort of what the fan
speeds are on things like that yeah how
loud it is and whatnot so the 1080 star
clock was 17 33 1070 we talked about the
10 60 basically the same thing as the
desktop yeah as far as the presentation
showed and then we weren't able to
benchmark it here or anything like that
so it's it's considering the 1080 did
seem to line up properly in benchmarking
stuff I'm sure the 10 60 does as well
right yeah and you you ran some
benchmarks as well yeah so is I'm sure
the line is tech tips channel will have
that yeah they're just in like the
camera right now and have no direction
yes but yeah we there we did some of the
just shadow more to our benchmark ace
yeah so we'll see how that pans out but
so 10:17 1084 those 1060 we don't know
yet we didn't hear a price either right
there's no pricing at all no prices
because and it makes sense they were
saying that that's more up to the
manufacturer that laptop and that does
kind of make sense in terms of tvp's
they were saying that it lines up where
the the 1060 has a similar TDP of the
970m right and the 1070 at a similar TDP
of the 980 m and then the 1080 is
similar to TDP of the 989 right which
was also in laptops yeah last year a few
years ago yeah yes is that stuff then
for other specifications all the cooling
and all the chaste he's all that's
obviously up to the manufacturers yeah
but the GPUs themselves still all Pascal
architecture gpb's 2.0 afterburner was
used for overclocking what else were we
looking at they don't seem to be
screwing around with like like they're
not on a different chip like if it was
GP 106 it's still GP but right that's a
good point too yeah so they're all GP
100 104 106 yeah I wanted yeah and so
it's not like the m's oh yeah like
slightly where they can screw around
with things I've changed what chip is it
getting and it's it's more
straightforward which is actually kind
of nice cuz someone coming from the
desktop side of things mainly whenever I
would look for laptops especially like a
long time ago the M editions was
completely throw me off yeah and that's
also for from a benchmarking standpoint
it's interesting because you can kind of
compare like a 1080 to a 1080 on a
laptop
yeah there's some we'll talk about this
in our reviews but like some issues with
obviously CPU yeah platform is 100% the
same yeah still good comparison there
totally then there's new display tech to
up to 120 Hertz now yeah honours yep so
you got 120 Hertz and then what was the
other G syncs and most things yeah 1440p
and a lot of them right yeah yeah which
is kind of cool and then they were
saying that there might be 1440p 120
it's left oh that's right they didn't
have any here but they're saying maybe
down the line and whatnot so we'll see
yeah I guess technically I think it's
possible yeah so a 144 or even just any
higher refresh at 120 Hertz on a laptops
at all is pretty new so yes very much so
and that's pretty cool because well like
personally I'm not super worried about
gaming on a laptop
the only gaming on the laptop I've done
recently is like total war Warhammer my
notebook but this might open the door to
later on the line this kind of stuff
being more common because the reason why
I wouldn't is because there were always
massive ridiculously ops I didn't want
to carry around being able to get a 1060
in like a really nice thin ultrabook
style form factor it's pretty sweet
that's a really nice yeah it'll be
interesting to is what I was think about
earlier we need to start including when
we do a spec table of the weight of the
laptops include like a weight of the
charger - yes it's always gonna be with
it yeah that's something we looked at I
was like one of the razor blades down
there they have really small chargers
that's actually a good amount of the
cost unit yeah that's pretty just like
giant brick production will be
interesting to like video production
yeah I don't know if you guys use
laptops for rendering and stuff that
shows it shows we do yeah yeah yeah so
we're currently using 980 amis for that
yeah and I think this sort of 1080 set
up for rendering would be a pretty good
absolutely yeah I've I've like when I go
on the road I edit my own videos and
that's on an 970m right so if you have a
step up from there it's nice it's
usually fine but every once in a while
when when jumping through footage it'll
lag out a little bit so stepping up
would be nice right yeah any color
correction stuff like that kind of eats
the render time - yeah exactly and then
it gets so hot and with these cards
they're saying that it should be 30%
more battery life compared to
Maxwell right which is pretty sweet -
yeah because the the more battery life
you get usually the lower the thermals
are those kind of tend to go together
which is nice yeah yeah definitely some
thermal impact and then either still got
their battery boost attack is improved
though yeah so now you can go up to
60fps with battery battery boost is just
when the chargers disconnected yeah and
and so they'll sort of throttle the
frame rate to keep the battery alive
right but now instead of 30 it goes up
to 60 what sir yeah we'll see we'll see
how it impacts about do you know I might
have missed this part of the
presentation is it customized well can
you still say 30 yes yeah okay so that's
good because sometimes like 60 is
fantastic and great but sometimes I want
those like extra 10 minutes yeah yeah if
it's if it's extra couple minutes and
you're just playing like total war
exactly yeah I'm not super worried about
60 fps and like the map version of
railway it's probably fine yeah yes I
that's the the laptops as we've seen
them now yeah we should definitely have
some in-depth stuff at some point if not
already on the channel this is all shot
before the yeah yeah the stuff goes live
I'm sure - tech tips doing some later on
you check out their channel will be
linked in the description below if you
don't already know it thank you
and as always patreon link in the post
roll video subscribe for more content
thank you for joining me live yeah no
worries man
well I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
