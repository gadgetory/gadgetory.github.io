Donna and I am joined by Peter Holt
Sowell again from Jager working on
dreadknots so we've spoken about
dreadknot a couple of times and it's
come a long way there are new
customization options and a lot new
ships and yeah is there anything else
that's new that we looked at today
there's another level rats and specially
am a steam kind of very red canyon like
level which place really cool like in
waves yeah yeah so with the
customization I thought this was
actually the gameplay has always been
pretty good but the customization was
really fun to me so can you kind of walk
us through what your vision is for that
yeah I mean the idea behind retinol is
that you can really be this the
spaceship captain that you want to be
with the ship that you want to have so
we started with the five classes that
ranged from like very Scout with an
important like to a better start a
lactic are very heavy dreadnoughts but
also repair ships and healers and
destroyers and its Louie cruises and
then from this core element we wanted to
like spread out so we added ships within
each class that actually play fairly
different from one another and then on
each ship you have four modules like
weapon modules that really change how
you can actually play the ship so for
example you played the the medium kabete
and you played it with a cloaking device
so it becomes this Klingon bird-of-prey
that goes behind enemy lines and then
drops torpedoes and you saw out like
enemy ships go up in flames and then you
use afterburner to get out of there but
you could also equip it with a blink
warp that lets you dance around enemy
ships really avoiding to be hit and then
get out of there quickly really causing
confusion drawing fire so that the rest
of your fleet can actually come in and
do the shot and on top of that there's
like four officers on each ship so
officers actually develop with you they
are you crew because like the ship is
only as good as its crew and the only as
good as captain's this unity or captain
crew and ship and those crew members
also develop skills and they refine how
you can play
so that's the gameplay customization and
then there's tons of lizard
customization on top of it yeah so the
visual customization like you said
changing the weapon loadout and other
modules on the ship does actually change
the geometry of the ship how it looks
anyway yeah and one of the things I
commented on was it looks like that the
models seem pretty high poly what was
the poly count again on the on the one
we were looking at I think I remember
correctly on that one with all the
modules equipped it's roughly 150,000
yeah so they're they're pretty high
detail my artists might kill me now
because it might be completely off but I
think there around that it looks pretty
good either way so the colors were we're
changeable the officers are customizable
how does the leveling and experience and
persistent progression work between
matches and things like that I mean you
basically curatorship you unlock new
abilities the idea that we have is we
really want to have a horizontal
progression so there's no real power
progression in there we want to keep all
the content relevant that's the thing
like basically if you have a blink war
or cloaking device both of them are
really cool they just alter your play
style it's not that one of them is more
powerful per se than the other and those
things you unlock over time and then you
can equip them viewership when you found
your favorite ship you basically can
have that in your customizations note
and then take it to battle and then get
more options find a new ship that you
find really cool and enter for like
there's tons of stuff to actually unlock
how about monetization is what's the
pricing structure for the game do you
know any of that yet we know some of it
but we don't know the pricing yet or how
it's actually going to work when you've
seen it likely we have the coatings we
have t curls we have color schemes we
have massive amounts of like geometry
customization that really changes to log
off the ship and also is attached in
different modules so you can mix and
match it to a certain extent and
yeah there's going to be a lot of lot of
visual customization to really create
the ship that you want to have you also
ever kept an avatar that you can
customize and make it your own kind of
captain so there's a lot of stuff that
we can do on that side one of the things
that we were talking about that was
pretty cool was the idea of getting your
team together and matching kits and
things like that so that you all have
the same color scheme and yeah tell me
yeah so we have all the color schemes
but then we also have our version of
hats you've seen it like this giant
figureheads that actually get attached
to the front of the ship they are
obviously inspired by like naval like
pirate ships with this figure heads and
so there you can do a lot of things as
well watch what's the immediate future
looking like for dread not released a
beta stuff like that yeah so we are
currently entering alpha faces like we
are still pre alpha but getting there
and close Peter will start early next
year and everybody can and should sign
up at plate red Norcom so looking really
good at the moment I mean that packs the
reception has been exceptional and we
are super happy about it and now
everybody needs to get into the beta so
that we can make the game better and
better and go into open BTW as soon as
we possibly can yeah sounds good so play
dreadnought calm is that it later played
naw Kham to sign up for the for the beta
which starts next year early and that's
all for the cover the video coverage hit
the link in the description below over
the full article and check out the
channel for a previous one or two videos
we did about dread not because it is
actually pretty cool game so that is all
for this time I will see you all next
time please stuff up to thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
