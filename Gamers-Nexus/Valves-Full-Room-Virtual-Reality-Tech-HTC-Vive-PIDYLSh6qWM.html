nexus tonight we're at valves booth at
GDC 2015 we just checked out a really
cool VR demo and i'm joined by dana
nicholson from HTC who are developing
the hardware solution of the head
mounted display for that demo so what is
the name of it and what can you tell me
about at a top level well the agency
vive we're announcing this week it's uh
we're announcing the dev kit we're
giving demos today the news we have is
we're committed to the product and we're
bringing it to market in the fall to be
the first real commercially available
pcs based VR system it is I don't know
it as you've seen it it's high
performance high immersion you get the
full in your gut feeling of presence
yeah it's it's it's a bit disorienting
after using it as a new user obviously
I'm sure you get used to this but as a
new user I walked away feeling like I
still had a screen in front I face but
it was extremely immersive there's a lot
of presence as we call it in VR and the
the depth in terms of my own depth
perception using it moving my arms
around it was unique yeah selfie it's
sort of the full room scale experiences
what we're trying to demo today I mean
there's a couple demos where there's you
know some crouching and some close
inspection as well as sort of marveling
at the atmosphere and there's in these
demos it's great to see like it's you
know you might notice there's no
shooting games in these games but I
think that shows the promise of the
platform is that even some of these
simple things like fishing and some real
easy analogs once they're so immersive
and they're so real some of these even
easy things are or they don't seem as
there's no explosions but yet they are
riveting and they are they they're so
real it's a great great demo of really
the platform in the promise and I think
speaking to that and that there was a
painting demo where I was given
effectively use the two controllers as
paintbrushes and as a palette at a
palette yeah and like you said no
explosions no craziness but actually
very fun yeah and cool so how we should
clarify us for the viewers this is a
full room experience right and how does
it how does it interpret my location as
a user great well the real secret sauce
there is of course there's all the
overall Layton sees there's the low
persistence displays and the optics is
one thing but the
magix office of the room scale is the
laser light house system that valves
developed so with these lighthouse
beacons they're doing X Y laser pulses
and we have light light sensors all over
the all over the mask and all over the
controllers so these are the basis for
all of the really precision movements
what's great about it it's actually
scalable so you could have 20 or 30
peripherals in the room they're all
tracked on the same system and its
really scalable I mean I love the
promise of that you can have your guitar
and your sword and everything else and
you don't have to unplug anything which
is great so it's a really scalable
solution and as you can see the the
detail the movement is really there and
so we're excited in these demos today
it's everyone standing up there's no
sitting down it's it's walking around
and touching things and we love that
love the big room skill experience and I
think you know these games are really
going to exploit that in a new way I
mean a lot of the games we see are
already are sort of in a cockpit or
something else and so I think this is
this brings a whole new opportunity for
developers and we're excited to see what
people will do do you have a target
release timeline or price yet yeah we're
committing to the developer community
that were say the develop dev kits are
out now they'll be ready to distribute
in the coming months and we're committed
to end of the year for a commercial
product so we're hoping to hit Christmas
and get these in consumers hands and and
have real consumer VR ready to go and so
this is the HTC vive HTC vive and it's
part of Valve's VR solution which we've
posted about previously lighthouse is a
part of that if you've heard the term
lighthouse this week that is referring
to the VR solution involving the HTC
vive so that's the full full disclaimer
from actual HTC developers designers
check the link in the description below
for full details and coverage of this
this very cool VR solution you'll see my
impressions there and we'll have
unfolding news as we get closer to
commercialization with the commercial
product announcement some of the final
designs and as we get closer to the
consumer product I think will be a
continuing story line here about steam
VR and getting ready very cool looking
forward to following it and we will see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
