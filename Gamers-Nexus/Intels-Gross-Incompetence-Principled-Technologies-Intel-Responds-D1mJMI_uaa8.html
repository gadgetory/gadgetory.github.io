I just stepped off a plane from Intel's
event in New York and man the tech media
was abuzz and the final hours they're
about principled technologies you may
have heard of them
Intel commissioned a company called
principal technologies to independently
benchmark its 900k CPUs and it did so
against other CPUs including a and these
so it's competitive benchmarking not
just within the same new generation for
example so this got then published to
the official Intel newsroom thereby
effectively endorsing the testing that
was conducted Intel seems like it trusts
the data and published it and put its
name on it so these these documents that
were published are effectively Intel's
documents we can put the possessive s on
there because Intel has taken possession
of the documents and has published the
data and references the data in its own
news room so the reason I'm pointing
this out and it's important is because
in a situation of gross incompetence by
a third party like principal
technologies which we'll be talking
about in great detail today the company
that commissioned the work can then hide
behind that incompetent company
principal technologies and say we didn't
do it we didn't do the testing I don't
know I don't know man
they did it push the blame over to them
but in this case there's a certain level
of responsibility that you must take
when you are branding something with
your name and publishing it on your
official newsroom website while you have
a room full of media from all over the
world
so in today's content then we'll be
walking through every single point of
Fault in the document painstakingly
focusing almost entirely on the flawed
test methodology we don't even have to
validate the tests although we have data
for most of them anyway
but we can speak to the flawed testing
from the get-go so let's do that
before that this video is brought to you
by us and the gamers Nexus store at
store doc gamers nexus net or you can
grab one of our other products like the
Raglan 2-tone hoodie which we have in
stock or the full gamers Nexus logo
t-shirt that we just restocked in cotton
and tri-blend flirtin more at store
gamer's nexus net quick update before
getting into this video we had it all
done but Intel called us and provided a
statement and so that's important to
provide before we get into all the
reasons why this testing that was bad
anyway the statement reads quote we are
deeply appreciative of the work of the
reviewer community and expect that over
the coming weeks additional testing will
continue to show that the ninth gen
Intel Core TM 9900 K is the world's best
gaming processor principal technologies
conducted this initial testing using
systems running inspect configured to
show CPU performance and has published
the configurations used the data is
consistent with what we have seen in our
labs and we look forward to seeing the
results from additional third parties in
the coming weeks now it's still
inconsistent with what we've seen and
also all of the other problems with the
content still remains so we'll go over
that anyway in this video but Intel
provided that statement after we had
rendered in everything so we thought
might as well include it and rerender it
so that Intel has their side in here as
well and another note here just before
you really get going in this we found
out principal technologies is about 25
minutes away from our office so at this
point we'll already be driving over
there we're just gonna show up and see
if they let us in and see if we can talk
to them about their testing
configuration so you're on some of our
own tests look at their data stuff like
that so we'll see if they let us in
probably not but this video will go live
hopefully just around when we're
arriving so they should have any reason
to shoo us away just you head back to
the original content first of all it's
it's unfortunate that this is even
happening right now because the 9900 Kay
launched what otherwise smoothly I don't
really have any problems with it as an
event which is really rare so the launch
was pretty smooth and you know the
company's stuck on an old process
they're stuck on 49 I mean they're plus
plus plus plus plus plus plus but
they've still made improvements that
consumers wanted they want with solder
they've they've listened to people and
they've done things to advance what they
have to work with and the solder yes it
probably helps them to get another one
or two hundred megahertz in a technology
where they otherwise can't but it's
still progress and to then have all this
soured by the principled technologies
publication which and I'll tell you why
why this annoys us it's exceedingly
deceptive two points of to the point
that we have to question all of the data
in the document because you know just
look at their ashes of the singularity
results they're like no one's ever seen
testing with those kinds of results in
ashes the results for the rise in CPU
are mind-blowing Lilo and this is coming
from the guy who was pitchforked for his
1,800 X review so before one post in the
comments that we're biased towards AMD
or something I'll remind you of that
incident this is not anything short of
calling out poor testing when we see it
that's what this is ashes of the
singularity it's not really a game it's
a synthetic benchmark and Intel does
pretty well in games they do well in
gaming benchmarks Intel doesn't need to
fudge numbers to look good in gaming
scenarios they already win whether or
not you agree with the margin to which
they win or whether it's a relevant
amount of frames per second you get
extra that's irrelevant right now all
that matters is that at core and thread
parity with a frequency advantage which
they have Intel will outperform AMD in
an unconstrained scenario so then why
why fudge the numbers ashes of the
singularity and maybe they didn't maybe
it was just completely incompetent
testing which actually will go through
that soon but Ashley the singularity
should post pretty damn good performance
on Rison and it's because it's a
synthetic benchmark that's programmed to
use all of the threads it's like the
only game that does that so it's it's
odd that this particular game jumped out
so much but it's not the only one so
anyway the point was that this was an
unfortunate thing to have happen
considering the otherwise smooth launch
of all this and Intel's got its name on
this so they even if it's a third
company they they are ultimately the one
that this report goes through intel has
QA teams they could have validated this
before publishing it but let's let's go
through it so let's tear it apart
and grow through the bench methodology
principal technologies tested eight CPUs
here including the 9900 K 8700 K 886 k99
ATX II which isn't due out for another
month the 2700 X and more it also
selected 19 games for its testing as you
can see on the screen on page one of the
report principal technologies
demonstrates its complete lack of
understanding for how to test games by
stating the following we use the in-game
benchmarks where possible otherwise we
used fraps to record frames per second
FPS to state that they're mixing
software to record framerate and that
they are using in-game benchmark
reporting is already flawed in that most
in-game benchmark FPS trackers are not
all that accurate and sometimes average
differently from fraps here's what's
also confusing principal technologies
also takes the median of three runs
rather than an average which is a very
odd choice when considering the sample
size is three and that the benchmarks
all have variants there's a reason that
we have standard deviation markers and
our charts so to then pick the middle
point of multi sample testing is
completely eliminating the purpose of
multi sample testing which is that you
can average the data and eliminate
outliers if you see any and then rerun
the test if you need to not to pick the
middle result that makes no sense
next part for Civilization six testing
and this is one that's close to us
principal technologies demonstrated
supreme levels of not knowing what
they're doing by running the graphics
benchmark to their credit they also ran
the AI benchmark which is the only
useful benchmark for CPU testing and sub
six but we previously published data
illustrating why the graphics benchmark
is more or less entirely irrelevant for
CPU testing and it's because it's civics
you know what the graphics benchmark
does in sip six on the slower CPUs it
will get to the next frame struggle to
process the turn on the CPU because it's
CPU bound and stare at that frame for
seconds on end
what's the GPU doing on this time it's
spewing out frames like
crazy cuz nothing's changing on the
screen so depending on how they tested
this and I don't know how long they
allowed it to run I don't know if they
let it run the entire duration or what
they did for the graphics benchmark it
probably did depending on how they
tested it though especially if they set
a specific test duration and then cut it
off at some point the actual result will
be that slower CPUs will perform better
than they should in any other benchmark
because the GPU is a frame rate or while
the GPUs ability to spew out frames is
what I should be saying while the CP is
trying to process the next turn is going
to counteract any performance deficit so
that is a tremendous fall on the testing
methodology and this is a a genuinely
bound to the CPU game for the most part
but if you're on the graphics test that
does change quite a few things so if I
don't know what they did here but the
next one so further know that principal
technologies and this is a weird one
routinely presents data down to even two
significant figures which is absolutely
hilarious now I'll admit we've done this
in the past but the reason we've done it
is because I forgot to remove one of the
significant figures when we're putting
out the data the way they're doing it is
seems like it's based on which ones use
an in-game benchmark and which ones
don't
so it's you can kind of probably looking
at the significant figures they have on
each one you can kind of figure out
their method of what they used to log
the data because we know which which
games do and don't present to that level
of accuracy and we know that it's not an
averaging thing because they say that
they don't average it they use the
median so like that's the other thing at
least at least when we've done multiple
significant figures that actually we're
not that significant we averaged a lot
of data so at least it makes some sense
because you've got math going on where
you end up with weird splits of numbers
but in this instance it's three test
runs supposedly cut down from three to
the median so you cut out one then you
cut out two
and that leaves you with one piece of
test data and so how do you with my
stomach comfort why is it significant so
it's it's a it's a very weird way to
present the data let's go over some BIOS
settings then maybe that'll be sobering
wake us up a bit for BIOS principal
technologies used different memory
frequencies across all of the platforms
they use 226 66 megahertz for Intel and
29 33 for AMD despite using all the same
kits although this sounds better for AMD
the company made sure to negate any
frequency advantage by absolutely
butchering the timings which are chiefly
important to all benchmarks particularly
on and the platforms another quick thing
that Intel noted and this is again Steve
from the future at this point being
edited in is that actually do CP was
enabled for the AMD product it just
wasn't listed anywhere the testing
methodology so they still step down the
frequency without really any explanation
whatsoever and then they did enable the
OCP which is a functional XMP but all
the other problems with memory timings
and motherboard variants between memory
kits and motherboards still remain so
that's still a concern even though it is
perhaps less of a concern than it would
be otherwise back to you Steve from the
past and we've even we've demonstrated
30% scaling by using the same kit of
memory with XMP and nothing else just
XMP just like they're kind of doing here
on some platforms moving it from one
board to another and the reason that
happens is because boards are all over
the place with memory times that's why
you standardize and you try to pick your
boards carefully and make sure that the
timings are pretty fair because if you
have TR efi refresh interval tier fe if
you have that one board it could be it
could be way higher than i mean you're
talking times a 20 percent refresh cycle
so TR FC that's another good one RFC
we've seen the same kit of memory
sitting at 300 RFC on one z 370 board or
whatever actually sounding board doesn't
matter you put in another one and it's
700 that's a big difference in terms of
forints that's pretty huge for gaming so
to not control for timings in any way
whatsoever is really amateurish is is
the nicest way I can put it so very
strange decision or one which is
completely uninformed which is more
likely and then next by the way if you
want to see some of that data for how
timings can impact things motherboard to
motherboard check out our what our RAM
timings video for primary x part one
principal technologies I would recommend
you watch it you might learn something
memory timings are extremely
inconsistent there and that was a big
problem for us so moving on from every
timings and on to things like thermals
which we also know decently well I would
say we have more concerns all of the
testing was done inside of a thermal
take case not one of the better ones it
was one that more or less resembles a an
r6 for example so it's got poor air flow
and this might not matter except that
the AMD CPU the 2700 X was for some
reason tested with the stock box cooler
which is okay as a cooler I guess but
the all the other platforms supposedly
we're tested with the noctua Nhu 14s
which is one of the best air cooler
we've tested recently so what happens
here is the eighth and ninth gen
products end up on a really good air
cooling solution versus a stock solution
that's completely unfair like okay so
the intel parts didn't come with a box
cooler why is that an excuse you're the
if you're like here's okay so here's the
thing if there are argument is the AMD
came with this one so we should use it
in our testing then the counter would be
that the intel parts didn't come with
one and so we shouldn't use one for
testing either stick to the same thing
use what's in the box i eat nothing or
use the same cooler for all of them it's
completely unfair yes it's crazy so
what's another way it's it's it's almost
like I don't know some of this stuff so
the company fails to mention control of
fan speed at all it's kind of another
really important thing which leads us to
question whether the fans were plugged
into the cases fan controller which
would be an accidental blessing and that
they would be probably somewhat
controlled with these in the bounds or
into the motherboard in which case who
knows who knows what it does depends on
the motherboard and they might be in
fast mode if they're plugged into the
case controller or something if they're
lucky it seems like the only way this
company would do anything at this point
competent for testing would be by
accident and so we will allow for this
possibility that maybe the fans were
controlled properly by accident but
otherwise it is not mentioned at all and
the 2700 x ends up without the Noctua
cooler
there's no there's no mention of what
the threader for CPUs used that we saw
anyway unless you missed it but if they
strapped a 10 hu 14s on there that one
is not specifically made for thread
Ripper unless they use the tr4 model and
that one doesn't the non gr4 model
doesn't cover the whole IHS anyway you
can make it work certainly we've done it
but if you yeah that was pretty funny
when we didn't do it though but if you
do that it doesn't cover the whole IHS
there's a big difference then performs
thread rivers so very very odd decisions
and again air cooling for the CPU so the
fan for the CPU coolers also left
unmentioned we don't know if that was
Auto or what it was next up eight
different systems were used with eight
different sets of hardware including
GPUs so even though it's technically the
same the same well we know it's a 1080i
for the GPU theoretically it's a
gigabyte 1080i who the knows well who
knows what the hell that means we don't
know which model gigabyte card it is
just a gigabyte even if let's just say
they use all the poorest gaming whatever
three fan car they use the same exact
model for all eight systems that's still
flawed anyone who's tested things knows
this so how do they not and the reason
that's still flawed we've tested this we
have multiple things like multiple FTW
three is multiple SC twos
and you know at one point when they came
out like a year ago we said hey what if
we take these multiple cards and we try
to get simultaneous benchmarks going for
CPUs and the takeaway was yes we can do
that but only in completely 100% for
sure cpu-bound tests ie blender ie
Cinebench maybe something like
potentially ashes but anything that even
for a second dips out of 100% CPU load
and goes to GPU load you start running
into issues of Pascal and silicon and
die quality to a point where on the same
card and ji3 census keep saying ie J's
$0.02 taught in that since literally J's
- sentence J published content on this a
while ago and we've seen a - where
between - same model cards and Pascal
you can have up to a 5% difference in
performance pretty massive and so to
have that maybe between two benches you
can kind of reconcile this with proper
testing and we've done that too but
between eight what what's your variance
then one might be 5% faster what if one
is 5% slower than baseline you might
have a massive Delta there and for no
good reason the principal technology
seems to be missing this specific core
principle but there's more still for
memory kits of for by 16 gigabytes were
used in every system which is completely
insane 64 gigabytes of RAM with a 2700 X
and an 80 700 K really really so they
either whatever the reason 64 gigabytes
of RAM that's fine but here's the reason
it's actually not fine
the reason it's actually not fine is
because as we said in the memory it's
you like they're just completely chaotic
sometimes there's XMP sometimes they're
not sometimes they're dropping frequency
sometimes it dropping it to a different
number than the other number and so the
reason we kind of came up with for
what's the motive why would you do that
short of just genuinely having no idea
what they're doing is because that but
also they try to make 64 gigabytes of
RAM work and if it's not validated for
the board
or it's just because 64 gigabytes of RAM
it might be kind of hard to get just
straight XMP sometimes the whole and
we've seen it
I mean it's 64 it's a lot to ask from a
system so it's possible that they were
having issues with the higher
frequencies and or the higher timings
and defaulted to garbage and ran that
instead which is an invalid test running
properly dual or quad on applicable
systems like a GT platforms we don't
know if they did that we don't know if
they use the right slot and while these
things seem extremely basic and one
would assume that everyone does it I
mean when you read or watch reviews from
any of the major outlets in the space
you kind of assume they have the memory
in the right slots but given the level
of genuine incompetence here you have to
start questioning everything everything
they did it seems like they've never
done this before so let's get into
software next that seems fun so first
off the Intel Tara obvious application
was installed these when possible rise
and master was installed and set to game
mode the company used the these things
are not terrible by the way but the
company is the exceptionally
extraordinarily flawed benchmark of
final fantasy 15 which we have railed
against time and again and discovered
originally that was us the problems with
it of not kollene objects and when we
saw that with ansel we then went in and
validated it with render doc which shows
that it's constantly rendering basically
every single object in the game ever
even stuff that you're never going to
see that's that's literally you have to
like fly through mountains to get to it
and it's not an issue with Ansel
rendering stuff and this is going back
to old content render doc showed it to
and to prove a point
Square Enix came out more or less
indirectly apologized for their terribly
flawed benchmark and updated it and they
didn't fix everything
but they fixed the hair works LOD
scaling issue and they admitted it was a
problem and NVIDIA knew it was a problem
but everything else remains including
the lack of culling objects that are out
of view the lack of calling objects
you'll never see the poppin issues the
LOD issues on things that are really
friggin far away so the the f-of-x me
benchmark is not a useful benchmark it's
not it is
trustworthy whatsoever and also it is
GPU bound almost every time but here
they've use it so they didn't get the
memo I guess but there's also the
company's ashes of the singularity
results and this is where hardware and
box
Steve alerted us to these via Paul I was
with Paul and Kyle and we all started
talking about this and they are on PC
worlds videos talking about it as well
and the results trash to the singularity
as I mentioned earlier are just
completely wrong everything about them
is wrong we already talked about it
earlier in this video but Andy does a
lot better than is presented in this
data if the environment is controlled
properly so maybe these are genuinely
the numbers that principal technologies
got that doesn't mean they're right
they'll be right for that set up but
nothing else so there's more for GTA 5
although the company explicitly
specifies every other setting used for
every other game and setting presets for
those games they do not specify anywhere
what they use for GTA 5 other than 1080p
and ovc and GTA 5 doesn't have a preset
you have to go through every setting and
set it manually and also GTA 5 will
change those settings with a hardware
change that's important to know because
if you don't know it's doing that it can
change something that you might not even
realize changed not like resolute it
could be grass quality and that has a
big impact on performance so we have to
question whether these are valid results
because they don't specify if they even
know that they have to do this and like
I said normally with let's just take
heartburn box for example or I don't
know an intact or someone like that if
one of those two sites or YouTube
channels runs tests and something like
GTA 5 I can trust with pretty good
certainty that they did it properly and
that they set the right graphic settings
that they know they might change and
that they're controlling those things I
can trust that with relative certainty
that's because those outlets have gained
that trust principle Technologies has
Illustrated that there is no reason to
trust them and so we must call
everything into question including the
GTA 5
testing finally there's a big disclaimer
at the bottom that reads the following
disclaimer of warranties limitation of
Liability principle Technologies
Incorporated has made reasonable efforts
to ensure the accuracy and validity of
its testing however principle technology
specifically disclaimed any warranty
expressed or implied relating to the
test results and analysis their accuracy
completeness or quality including any
implied warranty of fitness for any
particular purpose all persons or
entities relying on the results for any
testing do so at their own risk and
agree that principle technologies its
employees and its subcontractors shall
have no liability whatsoever from any
claim or loss or loss or damage on
account of any alleged error or defect
in any testing procedure or result
parenthetically and I'm adding this of
which there are many and then continues
to say in no event shall principal
technologies that be liable for indirect
special incidental or consequential
damages in connection with its testing
even F advised of the possibility of
such damages and no event shall
principal technology's liability
including for direct damages exceed the
amounts paid in connection with
principal Technologies testing basically
a refund customers sole and exclusive
remedies are set forth herein and also
it says elsewhere and this may have been
in the Intel counter documents that was
included but there was another statement
that said software and workloads used in
performance tests may have been
optimized for performance only on Intel
microprocessors Wow
so is that it nope there's one more one
more
there's another and this isn't too
uncommon it's just the absurdity of
everything else leads us to it Intel
there's a quote Intel be marketing the
Intel registered core TM i $9.99 hundred
K with the tagline quotes performance
unleashed close quote in certain
jurisdictions including PRC and Vietnam
Intel will be marketing the Intel Core
900 k with the tagline quotes Intel's
best gaming desktop processor end quote
in certain jurisdictions including
Argentina Belarus Belize Egypt El
Salvador Guatemala Honduras Italy Japan
Panama Peru Saudi Arabia and Turkey if
you are media or an influencer from
these countries or other
communicating directly to residents in
these countries eg on local language
social media please only refer to the
tagline Intel will be using in that
country and LU of the claim on this
slide or document which only I said this
this particular thing isn't malicious
we've seen it before all the companies
do it it's some weird legal mystical
marketing thing that apparently is
necessary and no one actually has to
follow it's just no one wants to be told
what to do either and you're gonna have
one to haggle on in one country I don't
know I don't know what what the deal is
but it's just you know in light of
everything else it does seem oddly it
seems odd
seems weird so that's that sounds like
the whole situation is just weird and
it's very disappointing because I'm
pretty excited about testing some of the
stuff coming up not gonna say the
products not really excited for the
product directly but for testing a lot
of it there's some cool stuff Intel's
done and it deserves being looked at by
someone who knows what they're doing not
these people not not these people
so I why why did you do it Intel why did
you do this to yourself it went so well
the event was was properly organized you
didn't have Jensen on stage talking for
three hours
you didn't delay meeting outside for two
hours in what the publican first you had
like useful demos and people on site to
talk to and everything was ready to the
point and we got the information we
needed we got it quickly for the most
part except for well whatever we'll go
over that later but then then I I leave
the event go back to the room prepare to
leave and I'm presented with this thing
let's just saw this that was just
whatever why why should do it anyway
we'll be reviewing the 900k probably I
think they sent it they did because
they're not going to now but I don't
know about that this is Intel's been
pretty decent as hangout samples but the
point is jokes aside we'll be reviewing
it and it will be reviewed in a vacuum
as it should be for purposes of testing
and seeing if it's any good checking the
value all that stuff um I could
consider this mess when we review it but
of course it's important to present the
mess to you so that you're aware of what
the companies are doing because
sometimes it's pretty screwy so an Intel
for what it's worth did not conduct
these tests but did Commission them and
then find them valid enough to publish
and stand behind to the extent of
writing documents with sub notes
referencing these tests and saying that
you can reference the document this
document for that data so intel's got
its name on it they've taken
responsibility insofar as publishing the
data on their own website or at least
referencing the data on their own
website so you can't hide behind I
didn't do it it wasn't me
anyway you like yeah yeah I could
present I can't think of any nonviolent
analogies here so I'm just gonna keep
them to myself but that's it for this
one subscribe for more you'll get a lot
of it you'll get our testing too it'll
be more or less in a vacuum
not a Dyson one they don't like us and
go to start out here insects design has
become one of our mod mats one of our
shirts if you'd like to support its
directly because it helps a lot what
would we do stuff like this and
patreon.com/scishow sacks is for that
Avenue as well also a quick note I was
in a PC world video on their YouTube
channel you should check it out it was a
lot of fun and thanks to Gordon for that
but anyway come back for more I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
