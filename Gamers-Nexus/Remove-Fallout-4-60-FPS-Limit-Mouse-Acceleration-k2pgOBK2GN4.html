dotnet and this video will show you how
to remove the FPS cap that is enabled by
default and fallout for the cap sets
your frame rate limit to 60 so you
cannot exceed 60 with this enabled and
it is located in the ini files which is
similar to Skyrim and previous bethesda
games it's using the same engine
actually as the previous games so to get
rid of the FPS cap the first thing you
want to do is launch fallout go to the
options and set the options to what you
want get them where you want them
because once we're done with removing
the FPS cap we're gonna lock the file to
read-only so you won't be able to modify
them after without changing that again
so once that's done navigate to the my
documents my games folder and find
fallout 4 then find a fallout 4 prefs I
and I that is the one you want there are
a couple of files multiple of them
contain ipresent interval but the one
you want is fallout 4 perhaps 2i and I
do a search for I present interval and
set it equal to 0 that will disable the
framerate limiter that is enabled by
default you want it back on you set it
to 1 once you're done with this save the
file close it right click on it go to
properties and tick the box that says
read-only then apply and that will stop
fallout from changing your setting from
reverting it every time you launch
fallout because otherwise it will
actually revert that setting every time
you change the settings or launch the
game and then if you want to change
things in the future you will need to
change that back to a writable file by
navigating back to the properties
disable the read-only setting and then
you can change your game settings check
back for more fallout 4 videos we've got
quite a few coming up and should
probably have some on the channel
already so check all of that hit the
