today I am north I think of Sacramento
I'm in over in California so this is
just some of the stuff that I do when
not working basically in order to stay
sane at the end of every trip I have to
do some kind of biking the last few
weeks it was EVGA first look at the EVGA
that was a 24 hour trip so I landed when
I step foot off the plane it said time
to check in for your next flight which
had to check into my next place actually
so it had time to check in for your next
flight and then I pull out to with
keygen the am the event horizon as in
san Cisco one-day trip flew home worked
on risin several 18-hour one 24-hour day
so it's four days home working flew back
to California same place San Francisco
through view the GPS or not review it
get news on the 1080p I well I was one
day trip blue back flip the boston one
or two days later did pack the east and
on a little Boston a few days later
taxis one day later came here for
another event and I on my own dime
decided to rent a bike not my not really
quite what i write it how am i right
more of a downhill bike at home the good
enough is a 10 and 0 1 60 in the front I
don't know what it is in the rear but I
home I ride a 160 front 200 rear to
Canfield balance but anyone cares so
today we're going to do some biking in
Auburn I am riding day one our common
time loop which was culvert and then
confluence where that with stone zone
hasn't ridden really in a year or more
me two years didn't easier travel for em
today I'm looking for some downhill
trails it did start to rain today we'll
see how it goes there's gonna be a blog
style video I don't normally do these
but I'm sorry Nepal a few days ago about
his shittiest video ever has he titled
it so here we are we joined one of the
hood so this will be our shitty ass
video ever but hopefully you get to see
some behind the scenes of what I try to
do what I'm not working a million hours
a week
so looking forward to that all right
made it to squirrel trail took me an
hour of climbing not too bad definitely
feeling it a little bit after yesterday
but we're going to try and pay it out
here this is my first time through I'm
not really sure what to expect that
serves me I'm going to be more cautious
and definitely i can be doing any gap or
any jumps up supplies any but if I see
something easy i'll hit it
a whole lot of all kinds of products in
the water yeah they were careful out
here after all that rain they got mother
until I want to go left make sure we
didn't kill you we can find that way up
the river we're going to find
out where this trail goes before i
blindly write it found it the river is
the answer
you're not going to write down there was
a good place to get lunch though I had I
me
so i'm here with patrick stone who
decided to join me he helps us that
event we were just that this is an
auburn is we're going to outdoor
confluence you don't know if you see
there's a collapsed bridge out there so
it's pretty cool but I out there riding
here's some kind of bridge it's big and
it's going over things writing an easier
trail for now so and husband in a while
I might go down on the downhill stop
tomorrow we'll see that
 that was cool you only really have
room a lot of time for half rotation yes
if you have disengaged rotation and spun
back a privation getting more
comfortable yeah when you want to go
applications but you don't have
engagements you got to burn a hole
revision yes we get back into or
whatever has some awesome announces yes
and yeah you basically late into the
equation yes do I have 200 milliseconds
of latency of Chris worst theory or
whatever to a lot of the time that's
enough time to not get any power out of
your pedal stress yeah you tell YouTube
where we are hey guys over here just
above sleep Clemens honor Clementine
lake or whatever some body of water name
coming on really cool Dan might be ahead
background noise doing a great hill
climb you're pretty fantastic yeah
Neverending hold on there's the damn
so right now we're either at the top of
a trail going down called culvert or
we're going to go around that corner up
there and then it's going to go like
this look either the starts going down
or we're in for more of a client but
it's done a pretty decent climb so far
so ready for some down huh ready for
some downhill yeah there we go yeah god
damn it bill yep yep after that I had to
stop to adjust the camera stone want to
head a little bit and making sure
there's not a bee in my helmet
knock on over
Oh bud how bad the culvert okay holy
 it's dark in here why this is
poison ivy on my feet waiting for stone
blegh pirater yeah I was going to say if
you wanted to try jumps was a good one
to do pretty great you know the trimer
keep going okay Steve Burke about to
make a killer run oh yeah how about how
that feel a lots of fun yeah those are
pretty good yeah there's a safe one to
learn on I remember when you introduce
you to the ones at 286 like these are
gory I bet my 20 back n no crab Trisha
okay geez you're on Giuliana you get
some gay so naturally goes that big
double check yeah before we go down like
a backcountry you keep you heard look
for date 108
like now let's make bring you our newest
tutorial called how to know you are in
California
oh I'm caustic leave your wheels are
specialized so you're tired they saw me
and I knew I needed a special by
world
wait mom stone pretty rewrite so far not
taking too many risks was literally the
plan today but considering I've been on
this bike for a few hours and have no
not not geared up to use it yet I ride
something a bit heavier bit more built
for downhill at home I don't like 20
Niners this is a 29er different for 26
years considering all that not bad also
not a home trail but definitely lots of
fun full face is way overkill for the
most part yet but I do like to wear it
when I'm riding somewhere I'm not
familiar with c4 overall
yes
he's black enabled right
and I dumped them
good worth it fair enough yeah screwed
up the wrong way come to the right over
here okay yeah okay the windsor Veilleux
your stone haha pretty cool trip i'll
edit it together we'll see how it comes
out definitely not trying to do a lot of
these but if you are interested in this
type of adventure video I guess leave a
comment maybe we'll spin off a second
channel or something then think about
that for a while yeah that was covert
and confluent on the demo I was on an
enduro it's a 29er not a big fan of 29er
is only 26 years but pretty good bike
for this type of stuff for sure and you
had a bronze and Santa Cruz robson which
actually the Bronson is one of my
favorite rental bikes I rent this one a
lot so this is what stone was riding I
believe it's just an aluminum Bronson no
no it's a carbon hit the bronze and see
ya Bronson see i'll show the travel is
on this what is this this is how 160
this is a 150 or 160 alright guys thanks
for watching subscribe for things that
are computer related and not bike
related if you like this though well
think about doing a second channel I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
