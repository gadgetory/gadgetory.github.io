about Corsair and what they had their
suite for computex 2016 so mostly
looking at the new maglev fans which
basically uses an electromagnet instead
of a normal ball bearing or something
similar looking at their new case or
revised case the 400 Â°c in white and
hydrographics and some ram but before
getting to that all this coverage for
today is brought to you by roseville and
their new Cullinan case with the
tempered glass side panels so back to
corsair corsair first off the 400 see we
liked it pretty pretty well in our
review it's a good decent case for
something of that form factor and the
400 c is now going to be available in
white that's all there is in terms of
cases from course are no new cases no
new tooling but the 400 see will be
shipping and white I'm not sure if the
price will be the same or if there's any
increase for having that white paint
next another very brief one the lap dog
was on-site and functional lap dog is
basically a on lap computer so you use
it in living room gaming scenarios grab
the whole thing put on your lap and it's
a fully contained computer in something
that's the size of maybe like a laptop
tray for your gaming laptop that has a
mouse pad has the computer itself and it
has a place for your keyboard a place
for your mouse does not include those
built-in or anything like that though of
course course sir I'm sure would be
happy to sell them to you bundled with
the lap dog so that was there we'll talk
about that more in depth if we got a
review sample but until that time we're
just going to leave that news where it
is maglev bearings so this one's a
little bit more interesting the new case
fans the ml pro which just stands for
maglev pro that's the new fan for
corsair they're shipping in 120 and 140
millimeter versions and the Maglev
bearing again replaces something like a
ball bearing or fluid dynamic
hydrodynamics something like that
because it's maglev when the electro
magnet is powered on the fan blades and
the units comprising the blades the hub
things like that will effectively
levitate off the base of the fan the
spinning is reduced friction because
their magnetic levitation bearings and
that in theory has lower noise and in
theory allows higher static pressure so
you get a higher CFM for lower noise
output the range on the
for our p.m. is 400 to about 2,000 maybe
24 hundred rpm not one hundred percent
clear with the max ranges price TBD but
we do know that it will be one of the
most expensive fans course ourselves if
not the most expensive fan that corsair
sells static pressure just quickly is
resistance to flow independent of the
velocity of the air and we'll talk about
that in our review of these fans once we
get the CFM testing set up and an
anemometer besides that the fans also
have single color leds so these mlpro
fans have monochromatic basically one
color red blue white stuff like that for
the LEDs and if you want RGB LEDs that
seems to be the trend these days then
you'll have to buy the revised version
of the SP series fans that's sp120 in
this case it has sort of a rain around
the fan Center so it's a ring of LEDs
around the center pointed inward and
that is as opposed to the hub lit LEDs
and these ones on the spr RGB those do
not use the Maglev bearings and should
therefore be cheaper there are also RGB
LEDs in the Vengeance and Dominator Pro
platinum memory and that's brand new
memory only 500 units I believe of the
Dominator Pro platinum or Dominator
platinum pro or whatever whatever it's
called one of those organizations of
words only 500 of those will be sold the
timings for the Vengeance and the
Dominator memory updates are between CL
14 and Cl 19 depending on what the
frequency is they do operate pretty high
one interesting item here is that the
Dominator series is being sold two bins
lower than what it is capable of so that
means if you buy this and it's
advertised at something like 3200 the
actual bin will be a bit higher so
you're overclocking will be pretty easy
that means if you buy this memory you
should be overclocking it because the
memory should basically almost be
guaranteed to handle those higher
frequencies because of the way coursers
bidding and selling it and that is
really just to surprise customers
spoiler alert we ruin that for you and
have a higher operating frequency than
as advertised now finally here the hydro
graphics card was at the suite this is
to 1080 with an H 55 CLC thrown onto it
so it's kind of like the Seahawk that we
reviewed that is the MSI version I'm a
sign coarser have partnered they're
selling the exact same video card but on
a different branding and my size is
available through normal retail channels
Corsairs is available only through their
web store wherever countries they ship
to but it's the same video card coarser
calls it hydrographics I'm a site called
it Seahawk uses the coarser age 55 CPU
CLC or aio liquid cooler and that's the
top the GTX 1080 GPU says GP 1 04 dash
four hundred and that pretty much sums
that up it's got a vrm blower fan as
well so that's what we got for you from
coarser suite at computex 2016 as always
check the channel for additional
coverage if any of this interest you
we've looked at a lot of these things
from other vendors this week as well
thank you for watching patreon link

i'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
