and we're going to do a let's play of
need for speed hot pursuit which came
out in 2010 there are of course the
older hot pursuit one and two games that
as a younger trader self I played on the
PIAA the ps2 not the PC but we're going
to pretend that never happened and just
jump right in here to the new hot
pursuit game or relatively new anyway
it's not this one so this game has a lot
of cars in it but unfortunately not that
many are available for each individual
event there are some pretty nice races
regardless in this game unlike the
original series you actually get weapon
oh my god what did oh that is ugly you
actually get weapons as a racer not only
as a cop and ho that's ugly too that's a
nice cut what that anyway you get
weapons as a racer and as a cop so as a
racer you can employ spike strips use
the EMPs you can use turbo blasts and
which are kind of like nitrous except
way faster and they push you past your
top speed and finally you can use
jammers which primarily just identify
where cops are and stop them from
blasting you with an EMP we're just
going to jump right into a race here and
see how it goes I've done this race a
few times and this is the one of the
ones i haven't gotten a gold on yet I
know shame on me and I had to turn the
graphics down a little bit for perhaps
but just the shadows so you guys
probably won't be able to tell a
difference since YouTube is so you know
how YouTube is with quality the way I
play this game is a little bit different
from other videos I've seen I actually
tend to drive the car lights my own and
try not to damage things too much
it just you know helps you win if you
treat it really nice and oh god there we
go so that close that out lag I'm going
to blame that on perhaps lag this is
another different thing with the new hot
pursuit you can crash like three or four
times before you're actually out of the
race and you won't get busted if you hit
a spike strip unless you've already
damaged your car to all hell so that's
kind of disappointed that they made the
game way easier I mean look I'm still in
third place even after that crash and
that was a pretty pretty dumb crash to
be in the drifting in this game is
extremely that was kind of bad timing
drifting in this game is extremely easy
actually despite what that just looked
like and uh what's kind of disappointing
again there are a lot of disappointed in
this game although it is a lot of fun i
have to say that is that they removed
manual you're only driving an automatic
here so if you bought a super awesome
race wheel with you know the clutch and
everything you're not going to really be
able to use that there is a mod but the
mods not going to help you if you bought
it on steam because steve auto updates
and the mod I don't believe has been
updated by the creator for a long I'm oh
so that's what they call a roadblock I
was actually just doing that to you guys
to see what happens you know graphics
and stuff it totally have never done
that before and I'm still in a second
apparently I promise guys normally way
better except not these how Percy races
can actually fairly challenging just
because of the road block placement
normally the only good way around is to
take a shortcut and uh that's a spike
strip by the way you can still squeeze
through like that without a much of a
problem but the shortcuts do help get
around the ones that are you know over
blind hills one of the cool things I
want to point out is the car damage on
this game has gotten way better my car
looks like it has a ton of damage right
now but if you look in the bottom right
you'll see that it's actually not that
bad so maybe it's a little bit over
exaggerated although I guess that's just
the body that we see on the outside you
can really beat the cars to crab though
and of course the tires don't get worn
down at all from what I'm doing right
now you know 150 mile power give them
there's another roadblock
man I'm bummed I haven't gotten to use
spike strips yet see if we can drop one
after this corner when they're closer to
me I think well if they ever get closer
to me some other things with this game
the environments actually have their
surprisingly good for racing game
normally environments are completely
ignored since you know car enthusiasts
want to see cars so all the polygons go
to the cars oh wow we're going to use
some turbo here it's a good opportunity
to show off how powerful it is this will
take us all of it's like 250 or so
and of course there's no damage because
that would be unrealistic yeah well yeah
no no damage if you turbo into someone
at like 200 miles an hour but if you hit
the road block at 120 then you're dead
there's an EMP by the way I'm gonna have
to use a jammer I tried to get through
the road via
the
shortcut well sometimes get you out of
the jama radius but or the EMP radius
but sometimes you just got to use that
jammer why is he down here normally cops
don't follow you but I guess this time
they did I'm gonna try and take this guy
out yeah but I hope stan's notubes in
here by the way so my tires just really
whenever it's no big deal except it is a
big deal cuz I'm and forth now there's
there's are looking for so he's wrecked
now because he's already damaged and II
had a spike strip and he doesn't have
your inflated tires like I do apparently
this game is a little bit more on the
cinematic side as you can tell like just
crashing into though like crashing into
people's going to trigger all kinds of
different cutscenes for wrecking them
like that or wrecking yourself in my
case and who the car even has a bottom
line that's impressive let's see what
else we got here I'm gonna try and he
empty this guidance from the holes and
I'm being impeded it's the human PMP
appeared empty ovide
I'm going to jam them and we got four
miles of this race left so I really
don't want to use turbo he had it might
have to this is a really bad place for
spike
there's helicopters also drops mic stirs
by the way but they're really pretty
obvious about it see if we can catch up
the first place here oh yeah what now
little known fact dodge vipers are
actually built for offroading oh that
was and what was that a half pipe or
something and inverse half pipes they
are yeah it's just something I do all
right I think it's time to use turbo to
catch up here this is one of the things
that does make the cam at that too easy
but it also it gives you some leeway to
screw up I mean I've crashed like three
or four times of this race already and
i'm still gonna finish pretty close to
first if not first so you can take this
cop out damn
that yeah so you have this that would
have hit all four of those cars
realistically but realistically I would
have blown up a long time ago so we're
just going to ignore that fact I
actually took out another racer there so
that puts me way the heck ahead and
first and we only got one cop on us now
there's the finish line BAM love that
car man all right so there is one of the
worst times i've ever seen for this game
and we're just going to say that was
because of fraps and because i was
teaching you guys how not to crash so
there's our first to need for speed
let's play I hope you enjoyed it we're
going to be doing a lot more Francisco
aka dr. gone has been messaging me here
is going to be putting up some of
dungeons of dredmor I believe I plan to
do one of Cthulhu saves the world which
is an amazing amazing indie RPG that's
really similar to legend of the seven
stars but more on that next week anyway
I hope you guys liked it and keep
looking on gamers Nexus done it for
updates we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
