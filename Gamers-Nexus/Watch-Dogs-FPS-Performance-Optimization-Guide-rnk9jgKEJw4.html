Nexus tonight and we are back with
another watchdogs tweaking video in the
previous video I showed you how to
disable the two worst things ever in the
world in history to happen the PC gaming
mouse acceleration and mouse smoothing
in this video we're looking at some
graphics tweaking and performance
optimization and we'll also be showing
how to disable some of the HUD and UI
elements that way you can learn how to
take screenshots without those HUD
elements obstructing your view of the
Chicago slums or the high or the
downtown area so first let's go and look
at the custom LOD settings level of
detail is a setting that you can define
in the game's options but you can't
define the lower level quality so things
like environment quality geometry
quality these things cannot be tweaked
individually through the UI you must do
them here do a ctrl F and find
environment quality one word and that
will bring us here to the custom quality
settings you can see I've currently got
it set to medium environment quality
handles the view distance of things like
NPCs and game objects without changing
the other LOD subsets so if you want to
have a very far view distance of
buildings and structures you would set
geometry quality to high or very high
and if you want to keep your view
distance of NPCs low you would set
environment quality to medium or low and
this will also impact performance but
it's potentially very useful for
screenshots it's a very powerful
combination to change geometry and
environment quality in that regard post
effects quality is just how the visual
effects look in-game you can change this
through the same low medium high very
high ultra settings as the others
texture quality you can set to either PC
or console that impacts performance
slightly by dropping the texture quality
and resolution and overall sharpness of
the textures when you change the console
do a ctrl F now for geometry quality
this is the one that goes hand-in-hand
with environment quality so geometry
quality over here handles the view
distance of structures of objects
and generally buildings if you want to
have a very far view distance of
structures and and the objects and
things like that you could set this to
high and and then keep your environment
settings at a lower value of performance
is an issue terrain quality is of a
similar tune it is the view distance
that you will have for terrain elements
so you'll still be able to see terrain a
little bit far out but this gives this
this impact how much detail that terrain
has so you can once again change this to
one of those options that you'll find in
the game this is derived from the level
of detail settings and is a subset of
those vegetation quality is how the
plant life and trees and stuff like that
looks if you don't care about having
high quality plant life and you'd rather
have the performance gain on a low on
system set this to low or medium and and
then we can move over so a lot of this
stuff is handled through the settings
like shadow quality shading quality
those are pretty obvious Road quality
you can set the PC or console have you
set it to console your roads will and
sidewalks and other things on the ground
floors will have slightly lower quality
they look a little bit flatter in terms
of the texture but you'll gain some
performance there in theory I haven't
really tested that too thoroughly but
that's the theory particles quality is
the quality of particle effects like let
me let me find that again there we go
particles quality so this impacts things
like smoke some explosions whenever you
blow panels up on the wall this will
impact that set this to low medium if
you are having performance issues when
encountering those elements or high if
you rather have it a you know better
tuned for a high-end PC moving on from
this we have things like rendering
splashes and rain if you don't want to
render rain for screenshot or other
purposes or just because you're sick of
the rain you can set this to zero if you
want to render ray and set it to 1 and
then splashes if you need a performance
increase when it is raining say for
example watch dogs rain makes your
system lag a little bit or drop in frame
rate set this to zero that will disable
splashes when rain hits surfaces it will
also just
table splashes when you jump into bodies
of water again improving performance so
that's some of the LOD settings under
the custom quality block now we can move
on to things like let's move on to
physic config so there's another file
called physic config under engine
profile you can set this to high-low
whatever I think that the fault value
might be high physic config is a subset
of LOD this one adjusts soft body
physics of cloth water and elements
affected by wind a real-world example
this would be to drive around on a
motorcycle in watchdog's and then look
at aaden's overcoat you'll notice that
his overcoat kind of flows in the wind
as you're driving on that motorcycle if
you disable this or set it to low you
will lose that immersion element but
you'll have some pretty good gains and
performance so once again that tweak
will help optimize for lower end video
cards like the seventy seven seventy two
of these 250 X 750 Ti stuff like that
and moving on from this one let's go
look at max pre-rendered frames I think
it's all one word it is all one word so
max pre-rendered frames you can set by
default I think it is a three this is
how many frames are being pre-rendered
on the GPU so each one of these frames
is filling the GPU buffer your memory on
the video card if you've got a lot of
RAM on your video card if you have a
large frame buffer you can set this to a
higher value and it will mitigate some
of the stuttering or frame drops when
dealing with vsync when you have vsync
on that will make your overall
experience smoother but with a lower end
video card even at 290 X in some cases
and testing because the game is horribly
optimized but with the lower end video
card for sure having this value above 1
is going to be a huge negative impact to
your performance to your overall fps set
this to 1 if you've got more
conservative Hardware in terms of
performance max driver buffered frames
is a part of the same family and I've
got this at zero for performance reasons
you can increase this if you've got a
high-end set up and want to be wanting
to put out and more smooth vsync
experience moving on from these we've
already done all of the graphics stuff
for the most part so now we can move on
to game profile settings and just type
in game profile and control F so here's
where we can control mouse sensitivity
and acceleration I already have a video
on how to do that so we will skip over
those elements and then you can also
tweak things like gamepad vibration if
you've got a rumble pack in your game
pad you can enable or disable here if
you're trying to take screenshots
disable use compass mini-map disable
things like use subtitles you can
disable the reticle on the screen by
setting this to zero it's always set to
zero to disable it it's a 1 or 0 as in
yes or no it's binary use Waypoint you
can set that to zero to disable the
little yellow Waypoint on the screen for
screenshot purposes PDA notifications
are the actual pop-ups when you get a
new mission or have another notification
set that's a zero to disable it or one
to enable it mini-map is here set that
to zero for screenshots and then a
couple of other UI elements are in here
as well so just toggle those based on if
you want them on your screen or not
basically finally network settings you
can use to control app for Network
profile you can use these to determine
which ports need to be forwarded on a
router that requires manual forwarding
for game ports so the ones you'll want
are 9000 through nine thousand five and
it details exactly what each one is used
for here and if you want to disable
voice chat because people suck then you
can do that here as well by setting it
to zero and I believe that can be
changed in game as well so that's the
gamer profile that XML file save this
set it to read-only when you're done and
the watchdog's will not overwrite it and
hopefully tweaking some of those graphic
settings will improve performance on
low-end hardware while retaining high
quality settings for things that are
important to you like via distance of
NPCs or buildings so please check the
link in the description below for a full
detailed guide on all this if you need
any help
leave a comment on that article if you
need help and I will see you all next
time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
