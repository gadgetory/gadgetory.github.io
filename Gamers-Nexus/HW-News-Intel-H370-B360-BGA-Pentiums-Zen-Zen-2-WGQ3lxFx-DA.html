weekly Hardware news recap we have three
big items this week one of them is some
new Intel leaks that were sent to gamers
Nexus we'll talk about those in a moment
we have some information on AMD Vegas 64
AIB partner cards this stems from a
Tom's Hardware de story but we've gone
validated some of the information in
that story and then finally some
information on Zen - aka Matisse so
we'll be talking about that and then
some memory items later on in the video
before that this coverage is brought to
you by the core G 21 enclosure from
thermal take a $70 case with two four
millimeter thick tempered glass side
panels and a power supply shroud with
top mounted SSD sleds learn more at the
link in the description below
the first news item is the Intel
document that was sent to GN so we
received an Intel launch update
documents or ILU from a source connected
to one of the suppliers in the industry
and the document contains some
information pertaining to coffee lake
and pentium cpus as well as Celeron cpus
later on it's got some additional
information on the road map into 2018
for chipsets and other launches and a
quick note here because Intel color
codes the documents by supplier we have
removed some of the color coded elements
and obfuscated the colors so it's not
the original color of the document but
we've confirmed the document with other
sources in the industry so confirmed its
legitimacy through others that I know
many of them however did suggest that
Intel's roadmap at this point changes
almost monthly so even though this is an
accurate actual leak it still might
change just based on what we're being
told Intel apparently has moved things
around a lot because of various AMD
launches and then some of their own
stuff internally so keep that in mind of
immediate interest to our audience we
learned that Intel plans to launch
Pentium silver and seller on Gemini Lake
CPUs in four and - core 10 watt SOC
variants in October and November these
look like they'll be BGA but they follow
the known Coffey Lake launch where we
already have all those specs anyway the
company aims to follow a XIII 70 with
launches of its H 370
a ch3 ten and B 360 chipsets in the
first quarter of 2018 and these launches
will be accompanied by other coffee-like
CPUs from the eighth generation that
includes additional six four and two
core CPUs again from Coffey Lake s Intel
aims to launch q 370 and q 360 business
chipsets in second quarter of 2018 and
we also know that Intel is launching its
obtain 900p SSD at or near citizencon
the event centered around star citizen
the SSD will be Intel's first SSD for
the enthusiast market following the
launch of Enterprise obtain SSDs earlier
this year remember that these are
different from the cache drives we've
seen thus far and may be more valuable
to the enthusiast market than what
shipped already obtained 900p SSDs it
will reportedly ship in 280 gigabyte and
480 gigabyte add-in card variants so
that would be PCIe cards and will be
advertised as quote optimized for
Roberts space industries star citizen in
the advertisement at citizencon
we were also told that these III 70
chipset is more of a stopgap solution
for coffee lake for its immediate launch
is e 370 as we understand it now
contains some trace optimizations for
power delivery with coffee lake and this
is necessary to make it work well or at
all we're not really sure which of those
two but it's from what we've been told
the trace optimizations and the power
delivery optimizations were more or less
needed so that may just come down to
power consumption but that's the real
reason that coffee Lake isn't meant to
be compatible with Z 200 series
motherboards we learned through multiple
sources that some of the earlier
engineering boards did support inter
compatibility between the products but
that's not something you should expect
for consumer products as has already
been tested by at least one site at this
point so this was eventually disabled
via firmware to ensure that coffee Lake
is on a platform that was intended for
it to use with those power delivery
optimizations and it sounds like Z 390
should carry with it to the bigger
performance improvements and gains
whenever that ships but we don't know
when that'll be at this point but that
follows up z 370
sometime in 2018 the next piece of news
is no surprise to anyone
AMD's zen to release code named after
artist Matisse is scheduled for launch
in 2019 on the am for platform these n
plus optimizations should chip in 2018
and will include performance
optimizations so as far as leaks go in
other words the sky is still blue but
not not like Intel they're like like the
sky is literally blue that's not a Sun
Intel thing it's not exciting news in
other words so yeah as n2 by 2019
then blast will be better about what you
would expect
the information was linked leaked to in
formatic zero or cero so grain of salt
in mind but it seems to indicate mostly
things we already knew as a community at
this point Zen plus is noted as
featuring optimizations but not
specified so we would expect there's a
whole lot of options you'd expect maybe
something on latency front maybe
something on the platform front maybe
something on frequency a lot of options
for Andy to improve Zen so that's
supposed to be 2018 and an APU News
Raven Ridge is rumored for 2018 with
eight thread Zen CPUs on them with 704
streaming processors that use the Vega
architecture so that would be 11 C use
from the Vega arc that we already know
Tom's Hardware Germany published a story
indicating that MSI contacts had
informed the outlet of no plans to
support the Vega 64 released with custom
cards we emailed MSI to follow up on
this and MSI told us the following as of
right now there's no plan we will do
custom Vega cards but it might change in
the future so that more or less confirms
what Tom's Hardware heard and this
follows a troubled launch for Vega at
this point which has routinely pushed
back potential launch dates of partner
cards the cards were originally slated
for late August and then we heard early
September for Asus and then we heard mid
to late September for Asus with other
board partners saying they were pushed
back to October and now asus has pushed
back to October as well so basically
October
or later at this point for a be partner
cards in the Tom's Hardware story
gigabyte noted that they would likely
produce a custom Vega card at some point
but they aren't 100% sure really what
they're doing with it right now so no no
firm commitment from amis or from
gigabyte at this point and no commitment
from msi so we understand this to be
largely a supply issue speaking with
people it sounds like the AIB partners
who make the video cards for gamers are
having difficulty getting their hands on
enough GPUs to put on the boards to sell
to their distribution and their their
wholesale partners so it there's no real
word at this point no updates beyond the
existing Tom's Hardware story of
probably sometime in October for more
cards to start coming out but Asus is
the only real one we've seen in the wild
at this point XFX and power color are
working on stuff as our sapphire but all
three of those companies are and the
exclusive partners so you would expect
no less from them since they they need
to make the card to survive so no
surprise in that front the agnostic
partners though seem to be a bit more
variable in what they're doing now as
for the Asus Strix Vegas 64 we sent out
a tweet the other day updating everyone
on our review of the card so we are
officially on a hold for that review
because the Vegas 64 Strix Edition card
originally
asus was so they shipped a few samples
to EU media you probably saw some
European review reviews go up and US
media lagged behind us PR was holding
onto the cards basically to wait for the
v bios to be finalized because in those
initial reviews it was not so the
results were more or less the same or
slightly worse than the reference card
now depend on which driver version is
being used there's an incompatibility
issue with the latest asus v bios that
the signed one and with the 17 9.2 i
think and the drivers and that causes
clock deficits up to 180 megahertz so
basically we're on hold until that's
fixed because otherwise
the results are just gonna be way worse
than reference or at least slightly
worse than reference because there's a
clock regression because of
incompatibility between the B BIOS and
the drivers a lot of this comes down to
AMD and their decision to not allow
custom BIOS at an enthusiast level which
also reflects onboard partners because
now board partners have to get their
BIOS more or less signed off on by AMD
and so that's causing some slowdown but
the real slowdown is is supply asus is
facing to slow down with their v bios
compatibility as far as reviews go but
there there are other issues as well
that all of these companies are facing
with Vegas so the Tom's Hardware story
is good they cover a lot of it they
cover some of the engineering challenges
we'd recommend you go check it out and
that's been rewritten on their English
version of the website as well in memory
news that corsair has updated their new
pair of 16 gigabyte ddr4 kits clocked at
forty five hundred and forty six hundred
megahertz respectively per the usual
with memory the forty five hundred
megahertz kit offers the tighter timings
of the two and runs at a lower voltage
alternatively the forty six hundred
megahertz kit uses slightly more late in
timings and drinks a bit more voltage to
afford the boost in clocks the forty
five hundred megahertz kit is available
for a four hundred and eighty dollars
that's sixteen gigabytes over forty six
hundred megahertz for five hundred and
fifty dollars next g.skill is also
rolling out new memories they've got
Trident II RGB kits aimed specifically
at rise and unthread upper the kids will
come with speeds of twenty four hundred
twenty-nine thirty three and thirty two
hundred megahertz with capacities from
sixteen to 128 gigabytes the modules
that feature the recognized Triton Z
anodized aluminum heat spreader replete
with the RGB light bar so you've seen
these at this point but the kits are
scheduled for an October release with no
current word on prices but again ddr4 so
it'll be high also in memory news is
guile and what they're calling the
world's first as far as being touted as
the first folio RGB illuminated ddr4
memory module with asus rog
certification so i mean generally
speaking you give me the world's first
anything if you just drill down and get
more and more specific on what it is
so I guess they've done that at this
point so aside from that the sticks do
offer ASIS or synchronized RGB support
these kits are available in both dual
and quad sticks so you get two or four
running at 3000 megahertz and offering
standard XMP support with Layton sees of
CL 15 at one point three five volts for
both options next for some miscellaneous
news EVGA z power 5 standalone vrm board
is now available or readied anyway so
this is the latest of its a power line
these are standalone vrm boards aimed at
replacing the V RMS on GPUs and the e
power 5 has a 12 + 2 phase design 12 for
V core - 4 v mem and is powered by 3 6
pin PCI II connectors in broad terms
EVGA ze power VRMs r4 sort of extreme
overclockers XO sears people like build
Zoid or kingpin who look for increased
power stability more power available
overall more voltage options and control
and the ability to adjust voltages
on-the-fly this a power board also has a
fan headers for cooling which it'll
probably need to some extent and easily
accesible probe points for measuring via
multimeters which is also very valuable
pricing and availability on that still
sort of up in the air but this is not
really a product that 99% of enthusiasts
should be buying just kind of
interesting to keep an eye on though
finally Western Digital has a 12
terabyte WD Gold Drive coming out so
this is eight platters with helium
rather than the usual mixture and the WD
gold pack will use eight PMR or
perpendicular magnetic recording
platters with the fourth generation the
fourth version of their Helio seal
technology so it's sealed with helium
again and it's using 1.5 terabyte
platter densities so 1.5 for each they
spin at 7200 rpm 256 megabytes of cash
and it's aimed at enterprise workloads
so this is replete with other features
for enterprise like vibration reduction
various protections security features
things like that
and it's supposed to be $540 for 12
terabytes which isn't the worst price
that we've seen for a harddrive so
especially with SSD prices right now
comes with a five year warranty targeted
at an enterprise overall but something
worth looking at for the future because
eventually those capacities will come
down to more consumer available drives
maybe in the blue or black line from WD
so that's all for this one as always you
can go to patreon.com/scishow still ike
our reporting or you can go to store it
out gamers next to sign out to pick my
shirt like this one we just restocked
pretty much every design and most the
sizes and there's a couple of hats there
too because wide hot so that's all
