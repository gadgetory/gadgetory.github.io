nexus dotnet it's the end of day 1 here
at PAX Prime in Seattle and we started
our day off by playing a cooperative
Assassin's Creed unity this will be an
up to 4-player cooperative experience
and players can pretty much seamlessly
drop in and drop out when they're
enjoying the single-player mission and
they can team up with their friends and
create these more dramatic Assassin's
battles and whatnot so it was pretty fun
I was with Ubisoft's producer on the
game and we got to enjoy a heist mission
where we infiltrated a sewer and
recovered some loot and in doing so it
was a very stealth approached based
strategy that we employed the game
itself is more stealth focused and as
some fans are saying out there it's
really going back to the roots of
Assassin's Creed whereas in with the
more recent games like Black Flag
Assassin's Creed 3 was more focused on
the actual melee combat so you really do
have to you know stay on your guard and
make sure that you're not attracting too
much attention from the other guards out
there mechanically the game has actually
seen some improvements so instead of
just holding down one button to parkour
and you know climb around the structures
and whatnot you actually have a parkour
up button combination in a park board
down combination so that it's easier and
more I guess player-friendly to go up
and down buildings so that's great also
the physics of the game seem more
realistic as well so you feel more
grounded to the structures that you're
climbing there's also a dedicated toggle
for for stealth so that you can crouch
down and you stay in that mode so then
that way you can always be controlling
you know whether you're ducking and
trying to be more stealthy in your
approach there so so that's good it's
good to finally see an assassin's creed
game implement that the other thing is
that the number of NPCs I've actually
seen it now the number of NPCs on screen
is at the scale that Ubisoft has been
talking about you have dozens and dozens
of people forming crowds outside of
cathedrals like Notre Dom in the in the
demo that we experienced here and I
think it's not just a body count but
it's also the level of detail in those
characters is very on you know lifelike
and so when you're actually walking
through that crowd you see all different
kinds of characters around you so it's
kind of neat to just get caught up in
that it's almost like you know going to
a convention like this you know it's
just you know taking place what two
hundred and twenty something years
before this event so yeah Assassin's
Creed looks to be a good step forward
for the franchise unfortunately the coop
is only online so there really isn't a
local tie-in for that but I'm sure that
there are some people out there that
would like to you know get together with
four TVs and for consoles or pcs if you
got them to enjoy that cooperative
experience so well be sure to check out
more of Assassin's Creed as more becomes
you know public knowledge here so check

Creed unity at the description below and
