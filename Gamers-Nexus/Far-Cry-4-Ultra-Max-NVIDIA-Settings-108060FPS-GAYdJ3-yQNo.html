Nexus Donna and I just wanted to show
you our Far Cry 4 benchmark course this
is the course that I ran when
benchmarking far cry 4 you can see the
full benchmark results linked in the
description below hit that link they'll
see all the charts and everything else
I've got another video coming up shortly
with the the benchmark recap so what
you're seeing in this course is really
heavy emphasis on lighting and shading
FX this is set with the Nvidia preset
because Ubisoft did partner with Nvidia
and that's the really this is the
highest fidelity the game will look it's
a bit better looking than on Ultra
because it's using soft shadows and it's
got enhanced cadres and what those
things mean is that the shadows will be
less hard on the edges so it'll look
more natural more like the light is sort
of bleeding into the shadow as it
approaches the border between the shadow
and the underlying object so that's what
soft shadows are and then the the other
setting which is enhanced godrays gives
us this really sort of beautiful effects
of the sun casting down into the city
where sometimes it looks almost as if
there's a light fog on the city in the
mountains but it mostly is seen in the
the sun rays bleeding through trees and
foliage so that's what the enhanced god
rays are and then we've also got TxAA
which is an nvidia version of
anti-aliasing that is just it's easier
to look at in movement you can't see a
difference in still screenshots but it's
temporal so it's time-based it basically
analyzes the previous frame the current
frame and determines how the scenes
should be anti-aliased in a fashion that
does not jar the user so that is the Far
Cry 4 benchmark course you can replicate
this on your own by following this
course and by reading my article into
the description below subscribe to the
channel if you like this content and to
make sure you see the actual benchmark
that graphs go live when they go live on
the channel and I will see you all next
time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
