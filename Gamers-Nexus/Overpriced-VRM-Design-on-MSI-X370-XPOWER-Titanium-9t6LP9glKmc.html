going to be taking a look at MSI is X
370 X power board so this is MSI's
top-of-the-line motherboard for the X
370 chipset is also as far as I'm aware
the most expensive am4 motherboard you
can get right now so you know you'd be
expecting great things from a board
demanding such a price tag I'll be going
over some of the overclocking features
the board feed the board has and then
we'll you know focus mostly on the BRM
before we get into that this video is
brought to you by the current bundle on
the GTX 1060 and GTX 1080 video cards
where you can get Ghost Recon wildlands
or for honor at checkout this comes
alongside new MSRP is for the GTX 10 80
series cards now down to $500 you can
learn more at the link in the
description below so with that out of
the way let's get started
starting off with the features so down
here you find a power button and a reset
button and this thing which is the this
is an automatic OC dial which basically
just preloads overclocking profiles I do
believe it goes up to like 4.4 or maybe
even in 4.5 gigahertz but I can assure
you that 4.4 or 4.5 gigahertz will not
work the like Verizon is just not
capable of such clocks on water cooling
or air cooling and and MSI just puts
profiles on to their motherboards that
are extremely high for the platform
they're all unlike my x99 X Power has a
has a 5 gigahertz profile which is a
profile that would work for like top 1%
of haswell-e CPUs not even Broadwell u
so yeah it just don't use it and do all
your over clocks manually it'll always
give you the best results rather than
relying on some pre-loaded profiles
because the problem is this isn't like
some automatic overclocking system it
just loads up a profile that's been put
into the BIOS which gives you really
high voltage for certain clock so
doesn't tend to work very well so moving
along the bottom edge
here we also find this six pin power
connector and this is here to provide
extra power to the PCIe slots so
basically well this slot down here the
slot above that these slots all get
extra power from this expand right here
as well as the One X slots should also
be hooked up to that but basically this
exists if you're running a well if
you're running a GPU setup which has a
really high PCIe power draw a lot of
people like say when the reference are X
480 came out a lot of people were
worried about the over draw on the PCIe
slot generally speaking your PCIe slot
is not where you're going to see issues
the main issue with high power draw on
PCIe slots is if you have two cards that
really pull a lot of power from the PCIe
slots or even three or four then what
tends to happen is the 24 pin the 12
volt connector the 12 volt pins of the
24 pin connector
tend to melt so because you push too
much power through them they heat up and
you know burn themselves melt the
plastic and basically destroy themselves
so in order to avoid that there is this
expand connector down here to basically
give you extra power for the PCIe slots
which could come in handy if you're
running like a crossfire setup with
really power-hungry GPUs but yeah I
think this is a little bit unnecessary
for four-way capable motherboards it's
really useful but the thing is this
board isn't four-way capable though it
is one of the few uh X 370 motherboards
which has this slot down here wired as X
8 as we can clearly see that you know
the paint like you can see that the last
metal in connection right there so
that's an X 8 like X 8 slot that's an X
a and this is the neck side as well this
is an X 16 but if you want to run 3-way
crossfire on this board then you're
going to be running X 8 X 8 X 8 and the
cool thing about well it'll work for
crossfire it won't work for SLI because
this last slot is going through the
chipset and that might
some issue but generally it should work
especially for benchmarks this won't be
a problem for games I I think you might
see some kind of latency issues and
other weirdness so this is a small
advantage over some other X 370 boards
because a lot of the other X 370 boards
in this at like the tall of you know the
top X 370 boards don't have this last
slot as x8 they have X 4 here which
crossfire will still run off of X 4
except even in my own testing for like 3
mark firestrike benchmarking X 4 starts
causing serious issues even like it X 4
is really really doggy
so while it'll work it's really not
usable so to speak so you know it is a
nice thing that this is included but I
wouldn't really recommend using it now
that moving up to the top of the board
the very last feature that is really
useful for overclocking on this board is
this right here which is of course a
post code display this is really useful
if you're debugging like any kind of
overclocking issues if for some reason
your system isn't starting up this is a
really as long as this is working this
is a really good way to figure out what
is wrong so that covers all the various
OSI features so with those out of the
way lights to take a look at the VRMs
our two main vrm sections are the vcore
vrm right here so that's the cord that
powers the CPU cores if you're
overclocking rising like your core clock
so you're going from like say 3
gigahertz stalk on a 1,700 to 4
gigahertz or 3.9 gigahertz or whatever
your tip is capable of this is the vrm
that will is the most important for that
then up here you find the SOC vrm and
this powers the memory controller and
all the other system on a chip parts of
Rison so that would be like the PCIe
controller the SATA controller the USB
controller there's just the SOC portion
Verizon is pretty massive and it has a
lot of components in it and that's all
powered by the SOC in the future I
expect the SOC vrm to also power I
gpus of all the a.m. for all the a.m.
for AP use which as a right now I don't
think any are currently available to buy
so yeah right now this is like I have no
idea how important the SOC is on rising
CPUs it's not that important but associ
doesn't pull that much power even though
it is like it takes up a lot of space on
the rise and die it isn't particularly
power-hungry
when we start seeing ap use the SOC vrm
will be more important as the GI GP will
probably pull all of its power off of
that and I GPUs do pull quite a
significant amount of power compared to
you know just controllers so those are
the two main VRMs you have on this board
both of them are controlled by this chip
right here and that is a ir35 2:01 this
is a h+ kind of interesting voltage
controller because it can do 8 + 0 7 + 1
+ 6 + 2 phase operation here it is
running in 6 + 2 phase because we have 1
2 3 4 5 6 phases here which are split up
like that and up here for the SOC we
have actually four phases which are
split like that I have 1 2 3 4 and that
3 looks terrible there that's more 3ish
so this is a four phase so this gets
doubled up the +2 part gets doubled up
and that's done by IR 3 5 9 8 running in
doubler mode and the 6 phase over here
the V Corps vrm is actually running off
of also ir 3 5 9 8 but the IR 3 5 9 8
can both be a doubler and it can be a
dual driver either or it can be both at
the same time but it can either double
or it can drive two phases also to be
done signals so you have three ir 3 5 9
8 and those give you your 680 core VRM
so you know this is actually a pretty
good well actually as far as control
schemes are concerned there's nothing
wrong with what MSI has opted for this
is very similar to what you'll see on a
lot of other motherboards they won't
necessarily use ir35 9/8 but they will
have like they will be using a six plus
two phase initial voltage controller set
up some of the lower end boards are four
plus three or four plus two so there's
really nothing wrong with this six six
plus two phase control setup so now
let's move on to the actual power
capabilities of the V RMS starting with
the V Corps vrm we have - we have two
low side effects and we have one eye
side fat right here the high side MOSFET
is a Nyko semiconductor PK six one six
be a this is a seven million RDS on
MOSFETs I've alts but the thing is this
is a high side fat so we don't really
care about RDS on what we really care
about is sweet it's witching speed which
these aren't really that great at that
and will actually get to the result of
that soon enough the low side MOSFET is
a Nyko P P k63 to be a and this is a 3.3
million RDS on MOSFETs and both of those
so this is actually like amongst low
side MOSFETs this is not that low RDS on
which loads I'm all sets the big focus
there is really really low low RDS on
ice I'm all set you want really really
quick switching really quick switching
and luckily MSI is using two two more
sets for the low side so actually your
RDS on is effectively cut in half it
also has the side effect that's the heat
put out by the low side of the
Fay's is spread across more surface area
because you do have two MOSFETs creating
all sharing the current and therefore
also the heat load so this does have
this this works okay
however these MOSFETs really aren't that
great compared to what you see on a lot
of the other high end motherboards and
the end result is that this vrm assuming
one point four five volts output voltage
which is quite a bit it's like 50
millivolts more than what you want to
run a rise in CPU at 300 kilohertz
switching frequency which is sort of the
typical switching frequency you will see
for most VRMs motherboards initially run
motherboards GPUs and everything will
typically run between 200 and 500
kilohertz switching frequency with 300
kilohertz being sort of the preferred
one because lower switching frequency
gives you better efficiency at the cost
of slight you know at the cost of
slightly worse voltage regulation so
that's why I chose 300 kilohertz because
the most realistic without having the
board in hand and being able to check
what it actually runs at so you have one
point four five volts 300 kilohertz and
assuming that the VRM is at 125 degrees
centigrade it is capable of handling 252
amps if you can cool 64 watts of heat
that that's a real problem a lot of the
other motherboards 4 X 370 have way more
efficient VR ends like that well and way
more powerful actually this is just not
a very good this is not a very good vrm
for a high-end X 370 motherboard it's
not going to limit you in any way shape
or form when overclocking arise in CPU
as Rison is actually extremely low
current you're looking at 4 gigahertz
1.4 or 5 volts for me in my testing only
seems to pull about a hundred amps from
the vcore vrm so it's really not a high
current demand CPU but this vrm is
really really significantly worse than
all the other ones even if it won't
actually impact your overclocking
capabilities because the control scheme
is line and it's not it's not like
you're going
hit a current limit it's not like you're
going to melt the vrm it's just not as
efficient as the other VRMs and if
you're putting 100 amps through the CRM
you can expect it to put out about 15
watts of heat so yeah it's you know it's
not going to limit you and overclocking
but it is less efficient than the
alternatives it's also lower quality
than all the other alternatives the
other like a Zurich and Asus both have
VRMs capable of excess of 300 amps
continuous gigabyte has a vrm that those
240 amps at the same parameters as this
one here except it does it with a lot
lower heat output and those hundred amps
that also weigh lower heat output so if
you're choosing your a if you're
choosing x3 70 motherboards with vrm
quality as your number one criteria this
really should not be at the top of your
you know selection because this vrm the
vcore vrm here is just terrible well
it's not terrible if this was a
mid-range board it would be fine if this
was a low-end board it would be actually
really really good but this is a
high-end board and also a really really
expensive high-end board so that really
you know doesn't work well here so let's
move on to the SOC vrm the SOC vrm is
the same also - except we're looking at
a one high side and one low side pet the
end result of that is that assuming the
same well not the same because you don't
want to run your SOC about 1.2 volts 1.2
volts 300 kilohertz 125 degrees the SOC
vrm is only capable of handling only
capable of handling 164 amps of current
while putting out 58 watts of heat
compared to say while compared to the
other motherboards available in this
price bracket this is even less
efficient than the vcore vrm like the
vcore vrm is not so far behind the other
competitors but this is just kind of
terrible luckily the SOC on reisen CPUs
really doesn't pull that much power so
in practice you're only going to be
looking
about 20 to 30 amps of current draw and
only about 3 to 4 watts of actual heat
output so that's not really a problem
but this erm again is just kind of
subpar compared to the other other
motherboards which you know like if
there's other features you desperately
need that this board comes with I'd
overlooked look to the RM issues but if
you're mainly buying this because you
want a powerful VRM this board is not
for you
there's better alternatives out there
now then let's move on to the memory v
RM for the DD ddr4 and ddr4 poles very
little power
and so this erm naturally doesn't really
like you can't go that wrong with it the
same offsets again and we have one high
side and two low side sets here so it
looks mostly like the SOC lost that
extra load side fat for space
space-saving reasons because here we
have two low side feds for no apparent
reason
because VD r4 is really really low power
and the end result here with this V RMS
this phase set up on the memory VRM at
one point four five volts because that's
a safe running like this is a safe
voltage to run ddr4 at daily if you're
overclocking one point four five volts
125 degrees centigrade 300 kilohertz
switching frequency this erm you're
looking at a maximum current capability
of 84 amps with 21 watts of heat
dissipation so that's really really
overkill for ddr4 because ddr4 runs in
single-digit power consumption for the
actual memory stick so even if you have
four sticks of RAM in here you're not
going to be looking at you know more
than say 40 watts of power consumption
and I've got really high actually that's
really really high for ddr4
realistically you're looking at more -
more like 2 to 3 watts per stake with
which with 4 sticks is only about 12
watts so the great news here is in
practice this erm will only offer
push about 10 amps and we'll put out
about you know one to two watts of heat
so this vrm here is perfectly fine and
in fact it does have an advantage over a
lot of the other motherboards out there
because this is a two-phase amending
other ex 370 motherboards both high-end
and low-end do not go for a single-phase
design though always how low-power ddr4
is having two phases may not actually
give you any major advantage in practice
even if theoretically it does even
though it's like theoretically it's
better but in practice it might not be
that big a difference so that pretty
much covers this board honestly I'm
really let down by what MSI has done
here it's compared to past
xpower motherboards compared to other
past and MSI boards this thing really
doesn't compare to to the predecessors
it is you know the vrm is really not
that great for the price point there is
no there's no external clock generator
on the motherboard you do at least get
the postcode and the power buttons and
the this is actually nice if you really
want to run across a 3-way crossfire
which that would actually be probably
like that I would sort of see as an
advantage for this motherboard but I
have yet to do my multi-gpu testing
horizon in fire strikes so I'm not
entirely you know it's like that that's
more from a benchmarking perspective
from a gaming perspective this this is
completely pointless and then and then
for some reason we also have an A+ for
pin can like this right here which makes
zero sense with the vrm that MSI has
paired like given this VR like given
this board because you like this VM
couldn't like it's just not strong
enough is like right first of all Rison
doesn't need an eight plus four pin
worth of power ever there's no scenario
where you're going to need that much
power and the other
if for some reason you actually needed
that much power this vrm couldn't handle
it anyway so this really looks like
they're trying to make the board look
better than it is by putting an extra
power connector that nobody's ever going
to use and yeah you know it's just
that's a marketing stunt as far as I'm
concerned that this right here is a
marketing stunt overall for a high end
motherboard this erm vrm is just not
that great but if there's as I said
earlier if there's any other features on
the board you really really want then
you know there's no issue that the arms
not going to limit you when overclocking
it's just subpar compared to the
competition so yeah that about sums it
up for this board and thank you for
