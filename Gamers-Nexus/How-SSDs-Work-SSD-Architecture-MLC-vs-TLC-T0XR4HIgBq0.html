Nexus Donna and I am joined once again
by Kent Smith from LSI and today we're
talking some more about the about
evolving flash types and a couple of
other topics so you know you've all seen
mlc and TLC and and things of that
nature
when selecting a solid state driver when
reading reviews and it's beyond the spec
sheet on Newegg or wherever you look at
your looking there's not a whole lot of
technical depth so that's where we're
going today and starting with the flash
types the NAND types mlc as an acronym
means multi-level multi-level cell TLC
is triple level cell and that's sort of
where a lot of it stops so can I get you
to tell us some more about how how that
actually works what it actually means
sure and just to clear everybody we
skipped over SLC of course range today
you really only see in the high end
Enterprise SLC meaning single-level cell
but what that's talking about is the
actual voltage levels that are kept
within a cell so single-level cell
meaning there's really two voltage
levels effectively on-and-off it's
storing for one bit when you go to mlc
or two levels you actually store four
bits or four levels so that means
there's there's four voltage levels that
are being stored in an individual cell
and versus just two levels so it's a lot
harder to differentiate so if this
particular level here suddenly has a
reduced voltage if something drops it
now looks like the second of those four
levels and so that's a bit error and
it's only because of the ECC that you'll
be able to correct that the problem is
ECC has to cover a number of bits a
number of cells all at once and if too
many of them are wrong you've got an
error so TLC then is 2 to the power of 3
or 8 I won't bother putting 8 fingers up
here but it just gets that much harder
in that same cell in that same range
you're trying to put 8 different voltage
levels so it's really tough and Adam and
performance pretty heavily so is there
anything we can do on the controller
level to mitigate the impact yeah in
fact one of the biggest drawbacks of
that of course we were kind of talking
about that error rate because those will
those bits will shift over time so your
controller is going to try to take care
of that with higher powered error
correction schemes like we we announced
the shield technology on the latest
generation the SandForce controllers and
so that'll be able to do a lot more air
correction for future NAND flash as as
it continues to evolve the the speed is
also an issue as you mentioned TLC is
going to be a bit slower than MLC and so
you know the the pro of TLC is it's it's
cheaper to make because you get more
bits in the same silicon but the
drawback is it gets a little sore so the
controller has to do other things to
mitigate that you look at potentially
having more die so then you want a
bigger drive you know and today you know
the 240 gig capacity is pretty difficult
256 you know that's a pretty common
sweet spot and that for the most part is
is accessing as many die as you can to
keep it going as quickly as possible now
what do we have TLC just sort of got
introduced to the consumer market not
long ago by what happens next is their
next step after TLC the announcements
that have gone on from the flash
manufacturers are talking about 3d NAND
and bean and this is a category of a
flash memory if you think about SLC and
mlc and TLC as single-family homes you
know in a city and then in order to take
advantage of that same real estate we
want to build vertically right and so
there's a couple of different processes
that have been announced that
essentially make it sort of like
high-rise apartments so you can get you
know 10 or 20 additional levels for that
same footprint of silica and so it has
the advantage of you can now increase
that
I'm a tree you can go to a higher
process node so that lowers your error
rate it has the disadvantage of a little
bit higher cost but you then divide that
by having you know ten or twenty or
thirty different levels in the same
footprint and you get to go past that
cost curve today you know it's really
not cost-effective a lot of
manufacturing steps have to be worked
through but you know MLC was not
possible you know five ten years right
now so it'll happen it'll go for
programming race cycles can you give us
an overview of what it actually means
you know the basics are it's how many
times you can write to the flash and
erase it before it starts decaying
heavily and eventually dies right right
so how does that all work okay so with
in flash memory you can write to
individual pages at a time but you have
to erase whole blocks at a time each
time you do that erase process you
effectively decay the the cells now you
you could also argue it's the program
step that does the DK now that's
probably more appropriate but either way
you can't do a new program until you do
in a race so it doesn't matter which
side you're counting the count will
incurring increment and you will have a
decay in the cell so what happens is as
a decays the cells have less ability to
hold a charge so at the beginning of
life you know remember we were talking
about on mlc you have those four levels
it's really easy to keep those charges
as you cycle it more and more those
charges tend to start you know migrating
and pretty soon charge three and four
look like chart four and maybe charge
one and to look like charge one and so
then it's harder and harder to
differentiate so again the ECC does the
job of correcting that but if there's
too many errors in a in a single area
the ECC can't can't recover from it so
that's where the the cycle count comes
in if I say if I have a flash that has
3000 cycles that essentially means the
flash is able to go through 3,000
different
in that cell doing a program and a race
cycle and after you do the 3000 the cell
according to the factory says it can
still hold those charges for whatever
the spec is if it's consumer class it's
typically about a year so so we actually
have a cell decay exactly yeah so you
could potentially set your laptop
computer on a shelf and you know just
forget about it you're using your
desktop all year long you finally go out
for the next show and suddenly your
laptops empty because it's been a year
since you've turned it on so zap sort of
like your car battery if you leave your
car long enough the battery will drain
it's that same idea
okay and another topic is
preconditioning so I've mentioned this
when talking about our test methodology
on the website we do precondition the
drive before each type of test and you
guys kind of have the basics of it but
can you give us a top level look at
preconditioning why it's important and
then and then maybe explore why our
readers would see lower performance or
higher performance given different
intervals of use sure oftentimes when
you see a review or discussion around an
SSD you'll see that it has a certain
spec you know I can write so many
megabytes per second a lot of times
you'll see it's an up to number and in
many cases that'll be a fresh out of box
number and the problem with that is the
drive will only live in that lifespan
within its lifespan it'll only live in
that time period for less than one
percent of its life you know maybe even
point O one percent of its life so it's
not really helpful because as soon as
you start writing data to it it has to
garbage collect all SSDs have to garbage
collect now some will be faster than
others add garbage collecting but they
all have to garbage collect it's during
that process that the performance will
drop down because during garbage
collection if you're processing moving
data you can't take any new data in and
so it's that that that fight that
internal fight if you will over the
bandwidth to the flash
the host and the controller trying to
move data around that will actually slow
the drive down so when when you look at
benchmarks you want to make sure you
understand whoever did that analysis you
know did they do the proper
preconditioning and there's various ways
of doing it
there's many theories on it but at a
minimum you have to do some kind of pre
conditioning now we generally recommend
if you really want to look at real world
you want to sequentially precondition
before you do a sequential test and you
want to randomly precondition before you
do a random test now if you believe your
environment is a mix that's fine if your
test can have a mix of sequential and
random then essentially you just need to
run that test long enough to ensure
garbage collection is operating with
that particular configuration and you
will see the performance of what the
real world would look like with that
same condition right and so for any of
you who want to do testing on your own
drive at home to make sure you're
getting the specs that you've seen
online
generally what we do with when testing
SSDs is musuem etre and I can put all
the links in the description below and
as gamers you'll want to do 4 K random
preconditioning and testing because
you're gonna be using mostly very small
files where as sequential is more for
the heavy users who are writing very
large files frequently so I'll put some
basic instructions on how to
precondition your drive and do a real
actual test that way you get a actually
but the best thing to do would be tested
straight out of the box or secure erase
it and then do your your precondition
test so you can see the real difference
be the difference I really understand
yes you have hit that garbage collection
period because you will see a drop
especially on random writing right so
all that again in the link in the
description below and thanks again Kent
and we will see you all next time thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
