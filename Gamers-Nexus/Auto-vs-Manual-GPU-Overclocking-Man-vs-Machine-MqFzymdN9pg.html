will become painfully increasingly
relevant as humans desperately he
grasped at their last fits of non
obsolescence before the robots take over
and take all of our jobs and so in part
of this celebrating of man versus
machine and the advent of automation
we're going to be benchmarking automated
overclocking versus manual overclocking
the competitor is the EVGA 1070 TI SC
which uses an auto SE to bypass the
Nvidia rules of hey don't overclock this
and they said okay we'll just make the
sauce for do it so I'm gonna see if I
can beat that within the time frame that
this thing auto over clocks itself so
I've got the same amount of time to do
an OC here before that this video is
brought to you by thermal Grizzly makers
of the conductor not liquid metal that
we recently use to drop 20 degrees off
of our coffee leak temperatures thermal
grizzly also makes traditional thermal
compounds we use on top of the IHS like
cryo not and hydro not pastes learn more
at the link below so the way this thing
works this is part of precision and
basically it's a tool that does the Volt
frequency curve scan so it's a VF scan
and it looks at the what it thinks would
be the ideal voltage and frequency now
there's two different things here to
look at one is the basic mode basic mode
basically says that it has a voltage and
frequency lookup table in the card so
EVGA I think has three predefined
frequencies and voltages for an
overclock that the basic mode checks
against and then whichever one appears
stable is the one it will pick I don't
know what the table is I just know
there's at least three options the other
mode steps through manually and
increments the VF across the entire
range it's a bit more complicated and it
also seems a bit harder to work with
so we're primarily gonna be testing on
basic mode because it works better right
now and this version of precision and
the the takeaway here is that it's
there's a bit of a challenge the better
the silicon is the bigger the disparity
between my overclock and the machine
because I fully anticipate that I would
be able to beat this but as the silicon
is worse and quality and lower down in
the tier of the ASIC quality so to speak
the overclocks will be closer because
the table is already predefined in a way
that it won't overshoot it will never
shoot beyond the capability as if any of
the silicon really that these cards ship
with so the closer it is to the maximum
clock out of the box
due to silicon quality the closer it
will be to my potential overclock
because I would hit the same wall as the
automation so depending on how good that
quality is will basically dictate how
much I win by because I am assuming I
will win here just like just like any
other human who has their job threatened
by automation maybe you think that you
can drive cars better than Tesla can I'm
going to boldly state that I can do it
better all the way until I'm screaming
down the highway flying into an accident
because I didn't trust the automated car
to do it for me
so what we're gonna do is pretend basic
now before this I did test the longer VF
and it just it didn't work quite as well
I this perversion of precision is still
in development and it needs some work
still so we're gonna start this we have
three options here manual which is what
I'll be doing later quick test which
takes 15 to 20 minutes to do and full
task takes damnit I clicked full and
full test which takes 30 to 60 minutes
to do but doesn't fully work so we need
to not do that one right now okay there
we go quick test so what this is doing
now is it's running a rebranded version
of fur Marc fur Marc is a bit tricky for
overclocked testing because it's a power
virus workload it's not really
representative of games and sometimes
for Marc will give you clocks in terms
of offsets that are higher than what is
realistically achievable in a game or a
3d mark but it's what they're using it
works sometimes as a baseline and that I
guess as long as you're conservative
which I think this Auto OC will be it's
fine
so this is just scanning for artifacts
right now it's with that graphic
indicates and all its gonna do is scan a
whole bunch of the different OSI range
ISM it's at least three but there's more
options in there for it to scan
especially if you do the manual VF scan
and then determine what the overclock
will be so we're just gonna let this run
for a little bit
finish log how much time it takes to
finish and then I will have that amount
of time to apply a competitive overclock
to this one okay so all this did was
basically apply a 114 megahertz offset
on the cores this is again a 1070 Ti so
that's gonna matter so 114 on the core
it did not increase the power target and
it doesn't increase the memory offset
either it looks like so it's basically
just a core overclock of about the value
that EVGA or any other company would do
out of the box normally under scenarios
where NVIDIA hasn't restricted them so
114 is what we have to beat now I'm
going to run this in fire strike and
we're not doing games or anything
there's really no point because I mean
it's just performance scaling and all
we're doing this clock for his clock
matchup here so we're gonna do each fire
strike extreme ultra at normal and run
all of them collect the scores and once
we have those scores I'm going to run my
own overclock within the same about 18
minute window that it took to finish and
then we'll have the data to see who did
it better so here's where the actual
competition starts I have about 18
minutes to beat the auto OC and what
we're gonna do is first off immediately
set this power target 220 percent the
Auto C does not do this and I did set it
to 120 percent after its Auto C just as
he helped out at all but it did because
we weren't hitting the power limit so we
were hitting other limits first so reset
that's 120
secret here for anyone who doesn't know
the minute that Pascal goes over 60
degrees Celsius you start dropping
clocks it's by design it's part of boost
3.0 it'll go down 25 50 megahertz as you
increment up and towards 80
to to 84 so 82 to 84 although the more
obvious throttle point is not the only
one it is an incremented stepping and
yes I know this counts against my time
but because I'm so confident that I'm
going to win this battle I don't really
care and you get to learn a bit about
Pascal if you didn't already know it so
let's start with the fan speed at 65 I
don't want to cheat by setting it to 100
and making it too easy so you know what
let's let's take it down to 60 let's
make it even easier for the program to
win start 120 I'm gonna set up a stress
test extreme 60 loops windowed and we
need gpu-z and make sure OBS is going
yes so gpu-z we're just gonna look at
the sensors tab while this is running
and I already know of course that 114 is
a minimum stable overclock because
that's what it did so there's definitely
Headroom there above it now it did not
do any overclocking on the memory but I
know from benchmarking dozens of Pascal
cards at this point that they've never
really failed to do less than 500 it's
pretty rare for them to be incapable of
hitting that we used 400 megahertz
offset on the memory so are 150 offset
on the core 300 on the memory right now
and you know what I think we've got some
time here still we're doing pretty well
on time we're already better than it in
the overclock Department let me just
take a minute here resize my windows and
make sure the environments all get hit
okay so we're at 20 37 megahertz core
now this is a bit misleading because
boost 3.0 as you all know fluctuates
depending on what's going on so it's
gonna bounce down to 2025 sometimes
things like that that will stabilize
more as you approach 40 degrees Celsius
but we're not gonna push for that on
this air cooler so let's go forward
we're at 150 right now let's do 175 and
just set apply on that see if we remain
stable I'm gonna give this a minute or
so to burn in and while it's burning in
we're still at 55 on the GPU we're good
there I want to stay under 60 ideally if
I really want the best chance of hitting
a higher overclock or push that up to
70% now if so if if we can't stay under
60 it's not the end of the world it just
means that we might be down anywhere
from like 13 to 25 megahertz on the core
not a big deal because we're gonna beat
the thane anyway but if you're doing
this for your own competitive scoring
reasons the fun thing about fire strike
is that it's a short test so you can
blast the fan speed keep it under 60
easily for the entire test and you'll
score higher because the frequency is
gonna be more stable and higher so we're
looking good here let's do 200 and then
all this will have to be burned in
separately and we'll do the benchmarks
and things like that it's not quite as
easy as like it was stable for one
minute so it's therefore stable that's
not how it works
but that's not the point of this video
either so typically what we do for
reviews is you let it burn in separately
for a while and then you play a bunch of
different games cuz some games like for
honor will enumerate the clock
differently than others and then
synthetic applications and then you can
use all that experience to figure out
where the clock should actually be right
now we're at two 25 megahertz offset
experience tells me that this should
fail at some point soon because we're
pushing into the 20 100 megahertz range
on the core which is absurd to be able
to hold on to for most cards that we've
worked with in this class so we will see
if it holds on but typically does not
for now that what we can do is start
pushing up the memory a bit too because
that will benefit us a little bit oh I
didn't even hit apply so I didn't hit
apply yet and it's crashed which means
it was not the memory that caused that
crash although it would seem that way if
you thought I hit apply so that means
we're not stable at 225 let's go around
200 I think we still have time here to
play around with the memory so start
that test back up we got 200 now let's
go up to 500 megahertz on memory make
sure this is 200
see how that goes waiting on fire strike
costing me valuable time okay so that's
running 200 offset core 500 offset
memory we might be able to push it a
little more but let's just see if this
is stable and we're gonna have to call
the clock in a minute so if it is we'll
keep these frequencies for the GPU so
this is looking stable looking pretty
good we're gonna run the tests at these
frequencies because they're fine they
seem to be holding you can push it a
little further if you were really trying
but we're trying to just beat the auto
overclock in the amount of time that it
gave us to overclock so that's our
competitive bench with the auto AC it's
200 and 500 power target being a big
part of it and then we're gonna run some
benchmarks and see what the numbers look
like for each now I fully expect
obviously now that we've seen the clocks
are higher that these scores will be
higher than the auto OC the question is
is the autumn OC good enough that for a
user who for whatever reason maybe is
timid about overclocking or doesn't just
that frankly doesn't have the time to
learn the basics to get started I had a
head start here I already knew how to do
all that stuff so there's reasons to not
manually OC the question is is the
Otto's OC actually worth it or should
you just use the card stock at that
point so that's what we're gonna find
out okay so the results are in
let's start with the stock card the
stock card with fire strike 1080p was
scoring 20,000 229 points and the
roughly 18 minute overclock done
automatically by EVGA was scoring 20,000
885 points and when we applied a 20%
power offset to trying to help it that
didn't really change because we were
already hitting other limits so the
difference there Auto versus stock you
gain 3.2 percent by running the auto
overclocking utility which again it's a
lookup table it tests each one
and then if it crashes during that test
or has artifacts it goes down to the
next one that's how it works so that got
us three percent ish and this is fire
strike this isn't a video game your
mileage may vary games behave
differently some of them love clocks
some of them really don't care and just
need more shaders so it really depends
on what you're doing but for purposes of
scalability in comparison three percent
versus mine was eight point one percent
versus the OTO OC not versus stock but
versus Auto so at plus 200 and plus 500
core in memory I was at 22,000 576
points versus the auto OC of 20,000 885
so an extra 8% their fire strike extreme
the Ottawa OC got 3.7 percent higher
than stock which is a comparison of 98
59 points versus 95 83 points and mine
got eight point seven percent higher
than the auto OC a difference of ten
thousand eight hundred six points versus
98 fifty nine points and then if you
wanted to look at the FPS numbers that's
a difference of 57 for mine versus 52.4
for the auto OC whereas the fifty one
point three for the stock configuration
fire strike ultra which is a 4k test has
the difference is slightly bigger still
because we start benefiting from other
things potentially that memory clock
that the ottawa c did not have the auto
OC is two point nine percent ahead of
stock with a score of 48 74 versus forty
seven thirty six and my OC is 53 29
versus the others so that's a nine point
four percent increase over the auto OC
for the overclock that I did so the
takeaway here isn't to say anything like
look at me I'm a great overclocker
because that's not really the case it's
just if you want to do this yourself it
takes just as much time to do it as with
the auto C if you have a foundation of
knowing what you're doing and you
already know where all the tools are and
what the download things like that
the auto overclock is still useful it's
useful as a feature for people who want
basically a one-click option to recover
the clocks that were more or less taken
from them by Nvidia with a 1070 TI
because the board partners are not
allowed to release with a pre overclock
on a hardware level like with the other
cards so one click button in software
lets you get that back but if you're
doing that anyway it's not that hard to
do what I just did
take same amount of time and again it's
like another eight to ten percent
Headroom in the clock over auto so not
bad the fact that this can do the lookup
table and everything get it done in 15
to 20 minutes is pretty good it's
certainly a step up from what used to be
the case the takeaway though if you do
it manually it's always gonna be better
for now until Tesla Motors gets into
video card overclocking and wipes out
the content creator jobs but until that
time you might as well just do it
yourself and the tools you need everyone
here already knows this stuff but
afterburner GPZ is helpful a synthetic
software like fire strike or heaven are
good the reason I like those is because
they're really easy to repeat and the
data is fairly consistent and it's easy
for anyone to run the benchmark without
having to understand a complex game that
might may have special behaviors so
that's what I would recommend but you
know if you're just trying to buy a card
and click a button then Auto C gets you
another 3% if you really want that and
then from there I would recommend use
that as your foundation starting point
of saying this is the minimum it can do
safely for sure and then bump it up
until it crashes and that's how you use
the auto OC if you aren't fully sure
