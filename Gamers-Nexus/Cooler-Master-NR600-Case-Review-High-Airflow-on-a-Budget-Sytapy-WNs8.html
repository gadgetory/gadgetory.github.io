with us last week the queue 500l as it
turns out we didn't do this math until
today but the queue 500l didn't fare
well into housing at all in fact it was
quite bad it was one of the worst cases
we've ever tested thermally and we did
some math on it and the amount of hole
to steel ratio here is it's about 15.6
percent whole with the remaining 80 plus
percent being steel so that's why I
performed poorly and we'll have more on
this soon where I'm gonna cut a hole in
the case and fix it but the good news is
Coolermaster does have something that is
more whole than it is steel and it's
this thing so this is the NR 600 today
we're reviewing this one it's a much
more positive outlook than the Q 500 l
and the case has some genuinely
interesting points to it and is about 70
bucks so pretty competitive price point
as well before that this video is
brought to you by deep pools captain 240
pro closed-loop liquid cooler the new
captain 240 pro comes with RGB
illuminated fans and a pump easily
synchronized to each other for color
matching in your system the captain 240
pro radiator also uses a unique elastic
pressure relief bladder in the water
tank has a leak prevention mechanism it
expands and contracts based upon liquid
temperature to counteract a i/o leak
concerns the cooler is available now and
you can learn more at the link in the
description below color masters NR 600
is something that we saw at CES and we
saw it early enough that we were able to
make some suggestions so Coolermaster
did end up it originally had a potential
of one fan of the show they ended up
going with two so the second fan is
located in the center here we've done
tests with this thing with the front
panel removed we did test with an extra
fan we did new standardized tests that
we'll be publishing separately and then
we did our normal standard standardized
tests and the biggest thing here is
going to be how it performs when you buy
just one extra fan because that's $70
this is very competitive and you have
the budget to maybe throw another 10
bucks at an additional 120 millimeter
fan for the front and then you have
something that's got this ultra fine
mash this is a steel panel like it's
it's part of the case structure
rather than a dust filter and this is
one of the more elegant approaches to
doing a mesh front without also doubling
down on a filter because then you end up
with obstructions like if you did
something like that now you have
potentially the whole lining up with a
steel on the other panel that would be a
problem so very interesting case it is
priced around where we would like to see
the RL 0-6 but it's just not that case
is in the 80s to 90s these days it's
also seemingly low inventory the mesh if
I see the mesh is to our kind of wealth
the seam or so is a competitor directly
to this case and it's also got some NZXT
design elements to it as well so let's
get through Patrick's build notes the
thermal section and then discuss whether
or not the cooler master and our 600 is
worth 70 bucks at first glance the
cooler master master box NR 600 master
product master bears a strong
resemblance to the NZXT eh 500 mostly
thanks to the partial glass panel that
cuts off at the level of the power
supply shroud but also the flat
unadorned exterior cooler master has
gone increasingly minimalist with its
branding which is it limited now to a
logo shaved power button and an embossed
hexagon on the side of the power slash
shroud we went so far as to put the NR
600 side-by-side with the aged 500 for
comparison but the glass panels are in
fact slightly different sizes a glance
might not make it clear how much more
ventilated the NR 600 is than the H 500
though the the H 500 by tens EXT just to
be clear because Coolermaster also makes
one of those then our 600 front is
covered with a fine mesh that acts as
both a filter and a front panel
hopefully avoiding the thermal problems
that some cases introduce by backing
mesh with additional layers of
filtration and this is something we'll
test momentarily and demonstrate the
thermal differences dust will gather on
the outside and some inevitably gets
through but it's easy to wipe down and
the front panel comes off easily we
prefer this solution and find cooler
masters implementation of the fine
material to be of excellent quality by
opting out of a filter cooler master has
also made it possible to mount fans on
the outside of the chassis nearly flush
with the panel but still inside
the panel mind you so this should draw
more air in from the outside of the case
instead of just recirculating the inside
where sometimes you get up with a slight
gap between the panel and the fan
because of where the chassis positions
the fan and then you could actually
recirculate as we saw the BitFenix and
so this is another good move by
coolermaster and a stark departure from
the disappointment that was the q500 out
the mounts inside the front panel have
three perfectly sized ducts for the 120
millimeter fans but not so for 140
millimeter ones to 140 millimeter fans
are technically supported but they
really don't line up well with the
cutouts and the mounting holes are at
the bottom of the panel rather than the
top so there's no way to point a 140
millimeter intake fan directly back
towards the CPU cooler they're also just
a couple of mounting holes that are too
small for fan screws although they would
fit radiator screws which is mildly
bothersome and sort of annoyed
Coolermaster also includes two 120
millimeter fans in the case one intake
and one exhaust which is much like the
mesh YC and up for the case to function
but not really excel it's difficult to
install fans of any size in the
bottommost slot because of the hard
drive cage which is riveted in place and
prevents most screw drivers from fitting
under the power supply shroud a
removable fan or radiator bracket would
solve this completely but also adds a
production costs a right-angle driver
makes this much easier opening the case
for the first time revealed two minor
fit and finish issues first there was a
tip of a broken off rivet nothing
structural loose in the bottom of the
case and second the glass panel doesn't
slide all the way forward to fit flush
against the front panel the glass is
supposed to be slotted in slid forward
and screwed into place but since it
can't slide forward that last millimeter
or so the metal tabs at the rear of our
case were bent slightly when the thumb
screws were tightened down at the
factory level this doesn't affect
function but it is visible from the
outside of the system the other side of
the case is an old-school steel panel
straightforward with tabs that hook into
the case but it's thick enough and the
cable management space is wide enough
that there isn't much danger of the
panel bowing out when it's being put
back on and this is usually the biggest
annoyance with that style of panel the
cable cutouts on the motherboard edge
the clearance for cables and the tie
points are well placed for velcro straps
to make Cale management
overall in this case the riveted hard
drive cage is the only roadblock
since it makes it more difficult for
users to repurpose that space for
storing power cables or just accessing
that lower fan chamber the top of the
case has a vent roughly 30 centimeters
long or large enough to fit to 140
millimeter fans its magnetic filter is
shipped stowed inside of the side panel
which is a great strategy to keep us
from using it with our stock test and
potentially hurting the thermals the
filter for the power supply event on the
bottom of the case is just a square of
mesh that fits into the cutouts on the
case it pops out easily and it's sort of
annoying to put back in but it's also
standard for this price range and not
something we haven't seen before
front i/o is limited to two USB ports
and one 4-pole or combined in and out
audio jack Coolermaster advertises the
combined jack as a feature but plenty of
headset users have split mic and
headphone cables that put out to two
separate 3.5 millimeter Jack's so you'd
have to use the motherboard there it's
just as likely to be a limitation as it
is to be a feature whether it's a
benefit or a drawback comes down to what
the user already owns so we'll leave
that there on the other hand
Coolermaster may have made up for this
in the compatibility department by
selling a version of the case with a
five and a quarter bay we rarely
bothered to comment on support for
obstacle drives at this point but it's
something that other mesh runs and cases
likely metruff I see the red line 0 6 or
the various other Coolermaster H 500
variants all shy away from the o DD
model of the case is a separate SKU and
doesn't seem to be on sale just yet at
time of writing but we're happy to see
that the market is being met for those
who still use optical drives and also
want to mesh case because that's a
difficult market to fill right now
moving into the thermal section we are
experimenting with two new standard
tests we have one that's noise
normalized thermals and then one that
standardized fan placement we've tried
noise normalized thermal tests in the
past but we've now settled on 36 DBA
using the stock case fans as our goal
we've begun building this content and
have included the NR 600 in the charts
but we're not ready to publish just yet
we'll do the normal review thermals in
this content and we'll have a different
content piece as we
add more cases for the noise normalized
and the fan normalized task because we
do need to send more cases through that
channel first well start the CPU torture
thermals it's just an hour 600 then
we'll add the comparative chart versus
other cases with a cooler master an hour
600 under full stock conditions we
measured CPU thermals at fifty five
point six degrees delta T over ambient
on running the torture workload with
idle at about four point eight degrees
Celsius simply adding a knock to a
fifteen hundred rpm 120 millimeter fan
to the front dropped CPU thermals to 47
degrees over a means a reduction of
eight point five degrees if you're
buying this case one of the best things
you can do is purchase one 120mm fan
they're not even that expensive the
improvement is because we've now created
a straight front to back airflow path
for the CPU tower cooler benefiting our
configuration greatly that doesn't mean
the case is bad and it's stock
configuration it's actually it's
specifically not bad overall but it does
suggest that there's a lot to be gained
from adding a single fat this is great
news actually because it means that
cooler masters front match design is
sufficiently constructed such that fan
configuration changes are meaningful and
have a significant impact to thermals
removing the front panel entirely has
formerly the same effect on thermals as
adding a fan which is because we've now
opened up the air to the CPU tower
cooler fan to directly intake without
obstructions or pressure inhibitors
adding a fan and removing the panel are
nearly synonymous which indicates
minimal obstruction to airflow with the
panel design replacing the fans with two
140 millimeter fans in the front yielded
worse performance for the CPU than just
adding one 120 and that's because of the
awkward poor fitment of 140 fans in this
case which are one partially obstructed
and two don't line up perfectly with the
CPU we really wouldn't recommend to go
in with them and instead would push you
toward a 120 here's the comparative
chart 55.5 degrees celsius cpu delta T /
ambient is average on this chart just a
little warmer than the mesh spicy stock
it's in the same boat as fractals messe
Phi it has great cooling potential but
is short on fans when the NR 600 is left
stock adding a single fans at the NR 600
achieves a forty seven point one degree
result which makes the NR 600 much more
competitive and puts it on the level of
the long phrase Silverstone our l06
another mesh fronted case that ships
with a full complement at four 120
millimeter fan
there's always a pictu balance to be
struck between case price number of fans
and quality of fans but both
Coolermaster &amp;amp; fractal prioritized price
the user is left and encouraged to
purchase at least one extra fan or maybe
shove a CLC into the case somewhere do
you torture thermals our next starting
again with a limited chart the baseline
tortured GPU temperature with the stock
case configuration was fifty four point
three degrees Celsius over ambient which
dropped to fifty point six degrees with
the front panel removed this lack of
reduction versus the cpu results is
because the single intake fan is aimed
more toward the bottom of the case
benefiting the GPU and the stock
configuration and so it had less to gain
this is probably best as the GP is more
thermally sensitive and will boost
pursuant to the core temperatures so we
think that for the most part color
master chose the right way to use just
two fans adding a single front intake
does little for the GPU and this is
unsurprising as we pointed it straight
toward the CPU cooler we measured a one
degree reduction which is within our
error margins we do not have test
resolution to state if this is a
meaningful change or just statistical
variance swap into the lopsided dual 140
configuration further reduced thermals
for the GPU bringing us down to forty
nine point nine degrees in this setup
because the top doesn't accommodate a
140 properly in favor of an optical
drive support option the GPU receives
most of the air and so is benefited
here's the comparative chart a baseline
of fifty four point three degrees is on
the warm side judged against our other
cases but is still well under control to
be fair the mesh if I see average fifty
seven point eight degrees delta T over
ambient in this test with a full set of
four one twenty motor fans three intake
one exhaust in this case we'd probably
see score is comparable to the RL zero
six across the board one of the
advantages of mesh fronted cases like
this is that adding it more fans will
continue to improve performance running
the fire strike extreme test on loop
average 56 degrees over ambient 4gb of
thermals a couple of degrees higher than
the torture test this places it in the
middle of the chart again but two
degrees below the stock Mushaf is two
and four degrees below the stock mesh if
I see we're emphasizing stock because
these cases would perform better with
additional fans if they were purchased
but that's also true for the NR 600
which we ran stock
this test as well stockin take fans that
have to supply air to both the CPU and
GPU are never a great compromise but
with airflow biased towards the GPU the
NR 600 manages to pull through
reasonably well in this test the blender
CPU render average 38 degrees over
ambient for the CPU the only component
stressed here which is a full two
degrees below the stock metruff I see
it's comparable to the NZXT th 500 and
within margin of error of that case
which is practically the same thing but
with a sealed-off front panel mesh is
great but without an extra fan or two to
take advantage of it no more air will
come in than it would through a more
restricted case at least not much more
depending on the pressure set up and zxt
also leans on leveraging a negative
pressure setup in their H 500 so air is
pulled through nearly every hole in the
case including unused PCIe slots and
perforations in the paneling with the
blender GPU rendered Evo temperature
average twenty six point eight degrees
over ambient for the NR 600 that's again
significantly better than the metruff IC
but just about tied with the H 500 from
NZXT
as well as the Leon the 11 air those are
both fine cases although the air is way
better without its filter but again the
NR 600 could do better with some
additional fans as scene of the torture
tests the stock fan does a decent job of
moving cool air in along the surface of
PSU shroud but it doesn't force a wall
of air through like the RL 0 6 does
noise testing is up to last
38.7 DBA is almost precisely the same as
we measured with the stock mesh of IC
which makes sense the open mesh front
doesn't do much to muffle noise but the
two stock fans also don't generate much
to begin with this case is reasonable
overall just know that adding more fans
will affect the noise given the front
panel design that said we've previously
demonstrated another content with the RL
0 6 with a versus a be quiet case that
mesh cases can be better tuned
acoustically by simply dropping fan rpm
which is a luxury not afforded by most
of these silenced focused cases as they
need a higher static pressure to pass
all the obstructions that are in the
case the NR 600 is actually a pretty
solid budget case we liked it overall
and it's one of the cases in this price
point that we would be completely fine
with recommending so good news there
it is a budget case though and so buyers
should be aware that the two 1200 rpm
fans that come with it aren't
particularly strong they're fine they do
the job but if you can justify another
ten to fourteen dollars to buy an extra
fan we would strongly recommend it and
then drop the 120 millimeter extra fan
right there in the front probably leave
this dust filter off because they
shipped ours with it off stock which is
hopefully how it ships in the real world
because if it if it's not on their stock
then we don't test the stock but you
should take this off if you don't have
anything at the top for intake because
filtering dust on an exhaust doesn't
make any sense but yeah if you do that
if you add a 120 fan you actually have
one of the best performing cases for a
configuration similar to ours which is a
pretty fairly standard configuration
especially for someone building with a
budget that would accommodate this $70
case and overall the build quality is
acceptable it's it's really not the best
we've ever seen but it's completely fine
for the price point the cooling is good
ish stock to exceptional when you start
adding fans to it and yeah we think it's
fine so this thing we did have some
complaints those are in this review but
the drive sleds are not present you end
up with a hard drive cage that's riveted
in place we found that very annoying
because to use this lower Bay you need
basically a right angle driver or you
have to really screw around with the
screw around with the screw driver for a
long time to get through the riveted
hard drive cage which is very annoying
and I had a couple of other elements to
it as well that Patrick complained about
in the build notes if you didn't watch
that you should go check it out in the
earlier part of this video so some
caveats over all but for $70 case it's
fair it's acceptable and this is one of
the simplest enclosures you can
manufacture it's it's very similar to
every other $70 mid Tower but that's not
necessarily a bad thing
the s340 is mostly dead at this point
it's been replaced by the H 500 by NZXT
that's a good competitor to look into
oh six is still good competitor to look
into Coolermaster zone age 500 at about
$30 more is another good solution to
look into and the fractal mesh of IC but
you should add fans to that is another
competitor so that's kind of your list
of competition if you want to do some
research on each of those and otherwise
this is fine it's actually it's actually
pretty good
it's much better than this thing which
is bad and you shouldn't buy it
that's the Q 500 l so that's it for this
