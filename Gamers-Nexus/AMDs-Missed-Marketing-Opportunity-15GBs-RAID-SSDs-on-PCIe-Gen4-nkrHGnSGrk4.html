in their keynote was take more advantage
of PCIe gen for being first on the
platform that they were unveiling and
unfortunately graphics and the 3d mark
demo although interesting is not really
the best use case for demonstrating PCIe
gen for a lot of modern graphics cards
simply don't need that much bandwidth
but this is where it does get more
interesting and that's because what
we're looking at is a four by four so
four lanes for four SSDs each 16 lanes
total going through an add-in card four
PCIe Gen 4 m dot two SSDs capable of
driving upwards of 15 gigabytes per
second read and write for sequential
transactions before that this video is
brought to you by the be quiet dark rock
slim keeping a high-performance focused
but reducing the footprints to
accommodate full memory slot
compatibility the dark rock slim comes
with one of be quiet silent wins three
120 millimeter fans built for low noise
operation the dark rocks limit vert eyes
is cooling capability up to 180 watts
EDP but mixes in a matte black out color
design to combine performance and looks
learn more at the link in the
description below so for Gen 4 PCIe the
real interest it's it's about two times
the bandwidth of Gen 3 of the same Lane
count and video card does state adjust
they really don't generally especially
in a gaming class need that bandwidth so
eventually yes and the some extent if
you're pushing all of your data through
PCIe rather than through some kind of
bridge like envy link or an equivalent
then it gets more interesting and we've
shown that data but with IO
it does start to become more relevant so
the intent of this card is to run up to
4 to terabyte SSDs and 40 terabyte SSDs
with 4 slots you do end up consuming 16
lanes and ideally if you're doing
something like this you put it in a
workstation device but the rise and
desktop CPUs can support as well it's
just something that we'll have to have
to remember this for when thread refer
comes out so the way it's set up is you
connect the SSDs in here as expected
slots into the PCIe slot the slot that's
connected to the CPU will be ideal if
you want to boot off the drive you can't
boot off of it if it's not in the
primary can
- CPU PCIe slot so for rising desktop
you're only going to have 16 lanes going
to one slot and then an additional four
lanes going to an MDOT - SSDs somewhere
on the board depends on the motherboard
manufacturer where that is and so
Verizon desktop then if you did want to
use something like this if you were
really I Oh intensive user you want
something like 15 gigabytes per second
we haven't validated that number but
we've seen the the benchmark screenshots
and obviously can do testing later
perhaps but if you wanted something like
that you do lose 16 lanes direct to the
CPU for a video card on a desktop
platform and that's why something like
thread Ripper becomes more appealing
because then you do have all of those
extra PCIe lanes and they're on the cpu
so that's really that's that's where the
advantage comes in that we wish AMD had
highlighted more in the presentations
because graphics is just for Gen 4 vs. 3
it's really just not that interesting
that's why you see a synthetic 3d mark
test being used to demonstrate the
differences because real games wouldn't
or at least not presently so that's how
its set up it does use redriver z'
because the top two slots are getting
far enough away from the actual PCIe
socket that there is some signal
integrity there's some signal integrity
challenges along the way so reed drivers
are used to propagate the signal further
the PCB we don't know exactly the
material or the type of PCB but it's
supposed to be a slightly better PCB for
signal integrity preservation I guess
you could say so that the signal can
reach all the way up to all four of the
SSD slots
that's much the card there's no price
yet what we're curious about is if you
want to want something like this it's a
very specific use case so it is heatsink
to which once you're driving this many
SSDs perhaps becomes more of a concern
and so there's a copper heatsink goes on
top of it a single slot blower style
cover and then a small fan which is
currently being tested at 1800 rpm will
probably have a fan stop mode for low
load and might be retested for lower
rpms because the copper heatsink is
apparently doing well enough that they
might not even need much active cooling
but do you need that that's the question
or if you don't need it is it something
that you still are interested in or want
and if so post a comment and say what
you think you would pay for this because
sounds like gigabyte is still in the
deciding phase for some of this so you
might have a chance to influence a bit
of that depending on the market response
and don't say $0 because that's not
helpful to anybody so that's the main
one I think we have some other
information on that PCIe gen 4 of course
the pricing TBD might be bundled with
AOS branded SSDs up to 2 terabytes
thermal pads or 1.8 watts per meter
Kelvin for those pretty standard the
there's back plate no functional purpose
just looks better and no RGB LEDs
because it's workstation focused so you
could maybe just buy it to protest LEDs
if you wanted to do that thread report
focus for bootable otherwise you could
use it in something else just you're
gonna you're going to have Lane
allocation issues so you'll need to
research the chipset and the CPU you're
buying and make sure it'll work out for
you and apparently the way this works
further is that each chip lit on the the
Rison platform can see two drives and so
that's what allows all four to be run
and raid and for the numbers we gave you
earlier the 15 gigabyte numbers that was
in a striped not mirrored raid or an
array then for the other device this is
pretty heavy it's 77 gram heatsink and
it's just copper so copper heat sink
goes on to the SSD won't be sold
separately from the SSD you'll have to
buy the SSD from gigabyte to get the
heatsink as well and the pricing is $270
for one terabyte files on e 16
controller SSD and I think this is going
to be called an ARS nvme M to Gen 4 SSD
res the other devices in a or SAIC Gen 4
SSD for the names and maybe have 8 TB
there at the end so it's just it's a fat
heatsink and I suppose that's really all
there is to this one but that's it for
the gigabyte expansion stuff at the show
we'll have a separate video on the
motherboards probably already live 4 X
