with Joe and Vince and as Vince aka
kingpin said it sounds like we're at
like a produce it stopped here as long
as my name's first Vincent Jose fresh
salad before that this video is brought
to you by MSI's x57 a motherboard lineup
Emma sighs X 570 motherboards will be
available on July 7th with the launch of
Rison 3000 series CPUs and now include
flagship brands like godlike ace and
creation the MSI edge will be among the
more affordable mid-range motherboards
appealing for most rise in 3000 builds
while the godlike has more overclocking
support an abundance of LEDs and OLED
and a server grade PCB for improved PCIe
for signal integrity keep an eye out for
MSI's X 570 motherboards for the rise in
3000 launch or learn more at the link in
the description below this is a pretty
janky overclocking setup but it looks
like it's gonna work we have we have I
guess two pots on the kingpin cards yep
right you got one on to pot on a 99 ATX
820 atti kingpin sli using KP c icon GPU
ln to pot on the cards and reusing the
QC t-rex i'm sube
okay so Joe what you were how much were
you involved in the setup or were you
just slacking doing anything no this guy
tinned over here basically kind of ruin
the set up several times way too much
talking it's not good for you no no
alright so let's talk about the setup I
guess for you got a KP cards you have a
new heater right yep is that on there
right now yeah it is a weak weak
codenamed it hell fire nice and it works
really well it's it's basically
approximately 300 watts of heat and it
it can counteract all that cold
temperature from the ln 2 pi okay very
good and I saw it not hooked up to a
card earlier so you've got like is it
resistors for is this just con the back
I believe that 7:00 this configuration
has seven on it right now and 10 made a
nice PCB that can pretty much it runs at
a fixed power whatever power we want it
to run it keeps it oh and the goal we
should explain Joe we were talking about
this so we have some first-hand
experience with like water logging the
cards basically yes so you want to pre
never went up to speed on what was going
on why you want a sake hitter well the
second heater will help so that there's
no condensation on the card so the card
will basically run for a lot longer
right like when we livestream next time
yeah everyone have as many issues right
yep no I usually asked him like kind of
what what uh voltage is derived like
that well he's done all the pre benching
right experience and I get it a lot of
time he's like just run the cart just do
it figured out just tested that so I'll
point out first because I didn't do it
earlier Joe from bearded hardware has
been on our channel several times at
this point to light up now yeah yeah if
you don't know who Joe is I don't know
where you've been but we'll link them
below and then Vince here is the the
namesake of the 2018 CI teams and that
we're working on today so we get to
actually see how someone with the real
encourage actually does it yeah should
be pretty sick so Ellen to what's what's
a CPU at right now I'm booting a 5 g 5g
booting ok ninety nine eighty exit yeah
so what we'll do is we'll boot in the
windows and maybe we'll run a time spy
extreme CPU test just to make sure in
the CPU will play nice maybe find seven
five eight okay and if everything's cool
then we'll pull the cards down and we'll
just go for it nice won't waste a lot of
time you know events last time you did a
video on this stage you started a meme
do you know the you know the
significance of your contribution to the
internet so every time I do a stream now
everyone asks me to get one she's done
ski in there really oh yeah no for real
it's really is it like ten times at
least really like every stat and hit him
every day God's goose
yeah and I'll say I actually say no
she's a she's Gonski Steve I use your
name yeah so you're gonna use easy you
want to torch that patch oh yeah it's
kind of tough with all that ellentube
bubbling in there but just do the best
you can do I'll just run one quick CPU
test
then I will overclock the cards and
we'll go remember they're switched yeah
yeah he doesn't the opposite direction
guys used to be difficult him too when I
do four way he's like if ia he helps me
very rarely but sometimes he does yeah
and he's I'll start go to quarter cards
and they're all wrong because he does
his probes differently everybody has
their own honors see the thing is here
is actually Vince is doing it the wrong
way ten and I do it the right ha right
yeah I go I go if I have four cards it
would be one two three four so one two
three four one two three four that's how
I would do they do it backwards to the
house wrong Joe has the second card on
the top isn't that weird
yeah so minus 94 CPU you have minus 52
and somebody come on up cheap years but
not really doing GPU stuff yet no not
yet
we got a mixer systems okay if you can
pass this then pull these down a little
bit more and we'll go the CPU pot those
need to be torched a little bit more the
thing is you need the reason why we
torch the pots you know that right you
guys discussed it yeah but it's good it
yours
it becomes more conductive thermally so
you can get those really fast reactions
with the temperature yeah don't don't
you don't want the test to end and have
the pot full of L into the interpreter
goes down it locks you want to have that
the balance you need to have it go empty
just as the test
and yeah look that's a pub right four
five seven get it girl ten degrees no
let's go okay let's go cards cards like
- 100 whoo
so we're at 13,704 cpu score on this
yeah we'll get some we'll get some
scores on the screen from some previous
batch runs I've done or something for
perspective for people what's your
highest CPU score on 99 I definitely
anyway I want to say it was like 14
something I think it was like maybe
maybe like 14 200 something like that
okay well we got this thing's got a boot
so let's try and just leave the fucking
boot quick she's not ski asleep she's
time to eat I don't know yeah Budhan
said no I think it's precision I think
it's trying to set the clock at 25 oh my
gosh try saying that but it's never
gonna fucking bear we could try to yank
the back card off and try to make it
boot that way
they call it Tim or something too
confusing like does that work like that
huh that would be easy man it would be a
great solution actually the problem is I
set the clock on position before I set
the voltage yeah so precision stuck on
2500 and it's trying to boot the card at
2500 and it doesn't have the voltage to
run it so it's can't put Windows key do
Safe Mode Tim just like uninstall fine
but can't access the voltage yeah oh but
can you get rid of the tool and of
course the card doesn't remember no
thinning okay yeah but if you uninstall
it does it set to firmware
do you want to do like like like 6
gigahertz 99 80 oxy Windows installation
[Laughter]
to go along with your practical gaming
island ooh that's right the restore
point is the 24th so it's gonna be
nothing we're stuck where we were truly
stuck
so you can't source is like classified
launching whatever one doesn't apply in
the settings or is it applied no there
are my definite lines both so into place
they fight clock but the voltage is too
low the trend you can but it's a safe
mode adjust timing stop you said onion
celery seed that would have been never
to work
so you can't just like delete the
registry or something from safe mode
he's a hardware engineer not a software
engineers or trust me 10 you see like we
could just plug another OS right now I
asked them weeks ago what do I need to
bring absolutely we got everything we
got everything to city would go by now
try and be so that we did not need an
incision about time he did PCIe and then
we did it so basically what you said
work pull down just these two who keep
this one
don't let it melt
are you in vents
on one card so this has gone to a one
card session okay let's make sure it's
CPU can still run after we've been
sitting here all this time they think
it's wrong it's finished single card now
yeah just the first card okay so why are
we running
see if the CPU works yeah we want to
make sure this he's dangerously close to
the coal bug though where does it called
bug like 110 okay - 108 107 let's
double-check yeah
4000 for bus when they called it
original okay well let's overclock let's
do some overclocking Joe put the card at
about 110
the PCIe slots disabled for the other
one I guess right yeah okay yeah but we
don't want it to melt either yes you're
still pouring smellin to in there you
ready go pour about performance falling
a bit parts too cold
yes but the heater yeah which makes it
really nice so we'll start off about
2560 ish this car dad till he can do
2670 almost 2700 the first cart
yeah very close 2700 I've been running
into this issue at 27 I stopped it
around like 25 65 when I was just
without a chaperone my first try to to
be honest I think I think actually most
KP guards will do 25 50 for sure and
many will do 2600 and to go above that
you need to be started to need the
better Vince did you work on the card I
got or was marking top no I did I didn't
work on it dude I just just really
briefly tested it to make sure it wasn't
a lemon I didn't actually have test it
to make sure it was Bend or anything I
just wanted to make sure hey it's the
memory stuck at plus 800 or push that
hunger the blinds not too good right now
either so slow really yeah which one BP
ba you needs because we need does this
full of ice you need to blast the ice
out of there and then torch it
you need really powerful dragon
so you're trying plus plus 454 offset
yep
Plus 1450 for the memory offset yep how
do you decide on where to put the memory
of like we didn't decided me do you just
increment by like 25 or 50 megahertz
when you're first testing a card
actually when I first started sensing
the KB's I saw like every card could do
like 1,300 okay and then almost every
card can do about 1350 and then you
start to see a difference like something
many can do 14 under it and then maybe
most can do 1500 that's not as easy is
just like studying and see if it runs
the erectus you can hit it like well
what's interesting is like some cards
will scale with a little bit of cold and
other cards can hit the max fuck on
India okay so you still if you pre test
on ambient you still can't tell which
cards are best on memory what kind of
memory voltage you normally end up
running for the max clock pretty high
this right now it's one four five
because we're not maxed out but for
example for example on Titan X r-tx yeah
he's running one point six under memory
okay that card needed it
yeah B months
like six yeah you didn't vote on your
card did you know I don't know how they
need they need to vote this one you
didn't know how
yeah bachelor we didn't have enough time
to actually go play around what's a GPU
pot j-man 110 105 is dangerously warm
for 25 5000 my faithful I thought you're
a twenty four fifty
so the way the card scales is about
about twenty five fifty can run this
temperature okay most cards and then
2650 is more like 120 125 okay and then
to her 2700 plus you need 140 minus 140
plus but he run into the issue where the
thermal grease is really stressed that
minus 140 on the GPU so that's where the
heart overclocking is the that's what's
gonna separate the men from the boys on
these cards who can run it at minus 145
not break the grease and keep the card
stable so is that just experience of
knowing like where to how much of it is
luck of the draw on your page
application versus knowing what you're
doing I mean like 10 uke so for example
when Joe and I Joey we broke down the
card a few times and rebasing it oh yeah
and every now you're pretty good
consistently but every now and then you
have one where it's like okay this is
just widget III do this how many times
did you guys know I like four or five
yeah over the weekends favorite five so
in your experience are you able to
pretty much get it good every single
time or you still
actually this plate helps a lot okay if
you can have a nice solid metal plane
behind the car you can get a better
mount okay hey did you guys notice like
when you mount really tight the card
will flex like a banana
yeah right so it's a little nervous
about it so if you think about it the
pressure is not really where you want it
to be if the card is folding around the
container that's not good you want the
pressure behind the diet right you want
it flat there right so with this plate I
noticed it's it's it's flat there and
then will start to bend on bend out more
on the outside okay and that can tell
when I remove it you can really see it's
better contact the first time the crash
was because he's not cold enough he sees
really on the borderline
but it's CPU test so it doesn't matter
right now you need to go colder dude you
need to be around 120 now for the next
clock I said CPU just leave it are you
ready to go for a real score now yeah
yeah so Joe we were we were talking
about this in the stream too as the ice
and water builds up in the pot what is
it like you want to explain why that's a
problem the people well it basically
doesn't allow the liquid nitrogen to
soak into the pot itself so it causes
issues where like when you try to combat
it with a port it doesn't work so it
just heats up and heats up in heats up
so that's why we usually use like a
compressor or something to basically
blow out at the bottom right and after
we like dry it well I mean oh you know
the pots have when I have a great shot
of this like today but cause have a
bunch of holes in them are they milled
out is that the correct phrase or
drilled out I guess but I drilled out
yeah just punch out holes in the bottom
of the pot and I guess that's water
sinks in it creates a separation layer
between that on to pot itself well you
get some of those holes will get plugged
up with chunks ice right and like you
said Allen to can't get to where it
needs to go and the guy yeah - minus 130
on GPU yep - 106 the other one Joe is
just so we've disabled the lowest part
here but Joe's just keeping it alive
yeah I told him keep it at minus 50 so
it's not doesn't turn the motherboard
into a lake and shut us down
well crash try again
what do you think that crash was no idea
man could have been anything they've
been running for so long
yeah you ready makeup work already
I'm actually very happy about the it's
done she's done ski steep she's danced
key I'm very happy about the GPU plates
yeah look at these things dude
Peters do you remember the cartwheel ice
cream stick your hand in there and touch
around the plate even this card isn't
loaded right this cards off yeah it's
not even I stopped for cold it's crazy
yeah it's been do you have it on that
website already actually that would be
the best test like we got two guards in
here we just turned off the second one I
think froze it it's not doing anything
yeah but it's nice and dry good test
actually very good that was their idea
why we come to come he likes to do this
so this is the worst case possible for
the first year than the course for me
all right
I think if you warm the card up to like
- fifty one time good little runs try
and try and get like once for it yeah
that's what we did last time
oh man we hate it up like every day
after every couple runs we had to heat
up the pot it's something about
something on the GPU that causes that
well I thought maybe it was pace so I
tried different application methods but
it didn't seem to make that much better
thank you
heating it up with like the best thing
my going to get job you ready
kind of a pain yeah yeah go for all hold
on e100 yeah sure - - 90 on the GPU on -
101 on the CPU you can kick it off Vince
what do you you're setting - 52525 and
5.8 5.8 yeah let's just see if it can
run it's not voltage yeah CPU voltage is
1 5 2 and 2.25 VI n okay GPU voltage is
1 point 4 volt set with the lowest level
of V group that the card allows so I'm
getting around 1 4 0 under load of 1 4 0
1 3 9 and beam M is at 1 point 4 5 what
did you guys run the vemma met when you
tested it what's your GPU said 100 right
well no no it's a little bit going up
I'm like 110 is ok when you complain
about I just do that man that's the
funny part the thing with our TX is it's
not like Pascal man Pascal was you could
just bench
you could bench for two hours straight
just non-stop and you just go right like
incrementally yeah but our TX is
different it's like
you know if you have a theory what it is
I have many theories but I don't know
the exact reason I really don't I know
that the heater plate helps a lot really
helps a lot
do you think it's like a like a change
in the silicon with like we're in a
position stuff or just like the way the
boost behaves or like architecture it's
more like like Public Works is applied
in some settings because if we don't
increase the clocks like run on the
default kind of flies then car can run
or like fine even like for the longer
time but as soon as you try it serious
overclocking even like twenty-four
twenty-five hundred then we will see
this behavior so with that speed when
how many degrees per second that's
what's important I say here we go again
if like if GPUs running if you have to
to fast change then you will lose the
grease so you have another problem okay
not bad that's not a bad score ninety
nine thirty eight single card yeah
thirteen 841 for CPU was the you have
five point eight yeah is that decent
yeah that's that looks good okay let's
run again though we're at a little clock
we're not too high yet yeah this last
little bit it's so slow
I think 10k is pretty respectable
Computex core goals so we had a lot of
difficulties right I'll just recaps on
that we've been running single card
because dual card got like bugged out on
the voltage or something or a frequency
I guess precision got stuck trying to
boot and 2600 so we've disabled the
second card with a PCI you switch on the
board which has proven to be a very
useful stretched today yeah exactly
right that's right there yeah and first
cards been running not okay yeah
no just torch it torch torch the second
pot and I'll run it at default GPU
temperature around minus 110 115 so
we've got like 20 score 20 points away
from the 10,000 thanks by extreme 12 12
point yeah CPU was running at five nine
five eight it's 99 lady excavating for
yeah and so the the scores then we're
trying to hit 10k before breaking down
and on the scoreboards the third place
was like 99 82 and you hit 99 30
something on your first like when you
first run back right and then after that
we got a 99 88 sorry in third now with
the worst possible environment yeah not
bad and then second is is like 10,000
288 I think top of my head and first is
using a 3175 axe at ten thousand five
something I think this system can
probably do can beat the 10 to 88 score
in better condition yeah its best
condition right I think you can do it
2026 2680 well roundabout minus 145 but
then you're at right at the limit of the
grease there
and there's something message about them
okay you're running again so keep it
stable if it crashes it's because of
your attempts not right in times five it
will usually halt right at the beginning
of the grease ain't right Vince do you
ever feel like you're watching Joe you
feel like you're like the Grand Master
trying to educate the student yagi
really like I'm like on edge I'm always
on edge watching my best because if you
want to take control freak right because
you could just get used to a certain way
of doing things I see somebody doing it
differently than you he does that always
like like going back and forth what have
you been doing the jalapao feedback that
watch that sec one sec guard did a video
a thing it's gonna get really hot in
this hallway just a heart like part is
part of the test right there I'm
streaming like step ones
[Laughter]
you getting dripped water drips right
yeah
Holly Monday dripping all over the
system every year it's like that worship
time just like bench anywhere all right
so we ended up and I think we're in
third it's really not bad obviously
tapie's in like first four total scores
but for packed together system middle
context that actually has water dripping
on it from the air conditioning duct
above us thirds not so bad considering
those conditions
yeah and it's awesome humid as hell in
here dude yeah humid water drip from a
pub front bench that's been running for
a while today
that's a 99 80 X 80 or just even we the
best CB running so pretty happy with
that we got to see the process of it Joe
and Vince going through overclocking
other KP cards is it true Joe that you
get to take this one home now yes I beat
every score we have yeah so Joe might
have one of these when he gets back and
