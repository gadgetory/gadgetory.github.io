GN this is episode 24 I think that we
were just debating the idea of pre
recording every number possible and then
inserting it in the event that I ever
miss speak and say the wrong iPod number
I think we're on 24 and this as always
comments below if you have questions for
the next episode there are plenty of
them we'll do our best to get to to
whatever's out there but it can't them
all so first question is from Jonathan
Poe who says hashtag ask GN that is an
artifact from the first one I'm noticing
that with the 310 ATS I have owned it so
far there that's a lot of 1080s there
seems to be some scaling issues when
overclocking I would call it diminishing
returns basically I can manually
overclock get some extra performance but
when I push further
you know if stable performance drops off
and the card runs worse in benchmarking
than if I had an overclock at all why is
this so some of this is described in
part when I talk about under Bolton with
the rx 480 and probably the previous
episode or the one before that and it's
sort of the same concept where the
diminishing returns would be the correct
thing to call this but we talked about
this in our 1080 review as well in our
1080 hybrid part 3 or 4 but basically
you're beginning to hit a limit
somewhere so depending on what card you
have that could be a thermal limit it
could be a power limit or it could be a
voltage V core limit imposed by V bios
and for the 1080 we found that with
reference there was a slight thermal
limit if you're running a IV partner
cards is probably not the case so then
you start looking at power so what
happens is let's say you overclock by
just throwing numbers out there so you
hit a 250 megahertz offset we did this
with the 1060 Hybrid 250 megahertz
offset and you can pretty much sustain
it but if you dip down to 225 it's gonna
be a little bit higher performance or
equal performance minimally the reason
that happens is the frequency plot over
time which we make charts for this if
you haven't seen them basically if you
look at the you measure the frequency
versus temperature
dureena maybe wanted to our burnin
you'll see that the frequency of spike
when there's less power available or not
enough voltage because V cord is limited
and by down stepping your overclock you
can produce a more flat frequency line
which is what you want and so that means
that instead of boosting up and down
kind of variably based on power
availability or whatever thermals other
issues you have a flat line so now your
FPS output will be more consistent so
that's where that comes from we kind of
plot all these in the hybrid videos
especially but also in the reviews so
that's that's most of it
if you want to test this yourself I
would suggest a 264 I think they have a
free version and you can use that to
check the frequency if there's also a
gpu-z if that's good too that is free
use gpu-z turn on the logger and plot
the log file after and if you see a flat
frequency curve then you're in good
shape and that will hopefully resolve
any of the issues that you're seeing but
yes sometimes it is better to actually
down clock slightly from your peak and
sustain a more stable output even if it
looks stable because you're not crashing
it could be not stable because of the
jumpiness of the frequency as it tries
to accommodate whatever limitations are
going on under the hood
depending on your card next question is
from - penguin if you said what would
you consider to be the maximal safe
target temperature for the RX 480
the goal is to have a car that operates
as quietly as possible without a fire
hazard don't know that it's a fire
hazard to begin with but we did have the
the fire extinguisher on the table that
one video so the the question here it's
it's it tries to sit around 80 Celsius
and that's pretty reasonable as is
that's where the reference card drives
to sit anyway I don't think that's
that's a bad temperature but if you
start pushing past 80 Celsius if you
enter the range of 90 then I would
definitely either increase the fan speed
or get a different cooling setup in your
case or different card if you're just
trying to operate quietly while kind of
maintain
as you said the maximum safe temperature
I would set the temperature target to
about 80 Celsius to a nice few cells
he's in that range somewhere and let the
fan take care of itself
you can manually configure a fan curve
the Whatman software has some very basic
function of this you can do something
more advanced with afterburner once it's
fully supported for whatever card you're
using
but that's the way I do it I'd set
around 80 to 82 Celsius for the maximum
temperature in the let it take care of
itself from there next question is from
Reza and L who says I have a question
planning on building a new rig as a GPU
I'm thinking about ZOTAC 1080 should I
go with the a MP or amp or amp extreme
does it worth the is it worth the extra
money
so the Valastro tack card we looked at
was an extreme card and I was not kind
to it I have not worked on any since
then because I don't think so Tech has
worked up the courage to try again so I
can't really comment on the 1080 amp or
amp extreme personally but as a general
statement with the 1080 and the 1070
line unless you're really serious well
even if you are really serious about
overclocking we hit enough sort of
limits with V bios and the voltage the
vcore setting for the GPU that were not
able to really advance the frequency
noticeably from one AI v partner card to
the next Japan on which one it is so
what you want to look for first is just
a good cooler and for the most part Twin
Frozr AC X Strix wind force they're all
fine coolers on the 1080 you don't need
anything insane you don't need a three
fan cooler or anything like that so
that's why I look at first a dual fan
pushed cooler will probably do the job
just fine
unless you're building in an ITX box
where you want to blow her fan instead
that's generally the idea for thermals
as dual push will work out well for the
1080 and then in terms of overclocking
like I said I think we worked on the
1080 gaming X and that performed about
the same or slightly lower than the
found
addition card and if you look at any
other 1080 they pretty much all sit
around the same overclock max so I
wouldn't buy based on claims to
overclock higher for example if someone
says they've got eight or ten or twelve
power phases or phase power design it's
not gonna change the world that much for
you so I would buy based on the cooler
and then the price if I don't know what
the extreme costs off the top of my head
but if it's more than a few bucks extra
over just the apps and I would say
forget it but again I haven't looked as
though tax and serve 980 extreme review
which was titled something like do not
buy the 980 extreme the next question is
from I'm not sure I can say that next
question is from that shitty chat Hall
who says what does that spec PCI lanes
in CPUs mean Wendy told me it means it
more bandwidth for SLI configuration
that's why you need a high-end CPU for
SLI it's not really exactly how it works
it's not bandwidth it's so bandwidth
there's they're sort of two different
things we talked about this a bit in the
x8 versus x16 video for SLI basically
your CPU and your chips that both have
PCIe lanes and that means that they have
a fixed number of lanes that they can
assign to PCIe devices whether they are
in the PCIe slot or whether they're in
interfaces that are enabled by PCIe the
bus so an example of a device that uses
PCIe lanes might be an m dot 2 as d or a
u2 SSD or something like that nvme
drives and depending on how they're set
up basically an m2 SSD will pull its
lanes from the chipset but I think this
is a common misconception so with
skylake onward there are HS i/o lanes
which are high-speed i/o lanes
I think the z170 has 26 of them I've
thought my head and I think H once the H
170 chip has something like 24 26 H 110
is less than that 22 maybe or last 16
but either way there's a stack of PCIe
lanes per chipset we have a video on it
I don't have
if you have a Z 171 it has 26 h SiO
lanes in segments of for those can be
diverted to PCIe so that means if you
had an AM 2 device which uses 4 lanes or
if you had some other PCIe enabled
device or not a GPU generally unless
it's a crossfire setup which can support
X 4 but you can't run an Nvidia card off
of the chipset lanes with the new Intel
chipset because they are limited to
segments of four an Nvidia requires a
buy eight minimum set up for PCIe lanes
the CPU has something like sixteen lanes
if it's a lower on CPU or it goes up to
40 on the high-end extremely serious
stuff so if you have 16 lanes the CPU
will basically say these 16 lanes talk
to GPU number one and if you have two
GPUs it'll say eight of them talk to one
eight of them talk to two based on which
PCIe slots you plug it into on your
motherboard and depending on how that
demands you set it up if you have a 40
Lane CPU it'll assign me it might assign
two sets of 16 millions to two GPUs if
you have them in SLI certainly it gives
you more bandwidth in that regard
because you're getting something like 16
gigabytes per second versus 8 with Gen 3
but in our testing that we did recently
with I think 10 70s are 10 80s the PCIe
lanes really didn't matter that much
because the bandwidth of it by 8 setup
already supports these new cards pretty
well so we were seeing about a 1%
difference so hopefully that answers
that question kind of topo we've talked
about this a lot before if you search a
channel for PCIe or lanes I'm sure
you'll find it next question is oh right
this one hey Steve what PC do you have
can you say the specs and show a photo
of it if you do have then does your job
leave enough time for you to play games
my compute the worst computer possible
out of the parts that have been retired
so all the good parts may be contrary to
common belief with tech channels I don't
use those all of our parts her review
stay and read
you systems they stay on the bench if
they're not used in the bench then
they're on a shelf waiting to be used
because it's far more efficient to do
that than to pull them out of different
personal rigs and use them in whatever
so when a part gets fully retired like a
960 then I'll move it into our render
bent or render machine or a production
machine for content creation but if it's
still an active product and we're not
doing regression testing yet then it'll
stay in the bench if we're keeping it
for regression testing it'll stay on the
shelf my system has an asrock 990 FX
board of some kind so basically a couple
years ago I said I'm gonna build an AMD
FX 9000 series system because I want to
play around with overclocking and I want
the experience of building and these
top-of-the-line system because we were
working with Intel already at the time
pretty regularly so I wanted to know
what is it like to build an AMD
top-of-the-line system as opposed to the
ones I already had experience with Phi
sevens and things like that cuz I did
know halen before this and frankly
Nehalem worked better for me for what I
do then this 9000 series chip that's for
a lot of production reasons the asrock
board I'm using whatever 990 FX extreme
9 or something that it's they're more
expensive aim through plus board it has
serious vrm issues and if you use the
liquid cooler that came with the FX 9000
chip like I did I forget what ship it is
but then I think it's 93 70 maybe but if
you use the CLC you lose that potential
for the fins the lower fins and the
heatsink to kind of siphon away some of
the hot air from the vrm that's a
problem so the VRM well occasionally hit
ninety to a hundred plus celsius i've
seen a hit 105 celsius terrible machine
it's in an old thor or no not through
authorities in a throne
a white throne from Roseville that we
reviewed ages ago I think so that's the
the Box it's in which I also don't
really like that much but and then I had
to down clock it to save the vrm because
it was
overheating and playing games it would
start screaming the fan actually just
watching a YouTube video the decode
works so hard right now that it screams
with the fans so not a good system the
video card I think I have a 780 in there
it's enough for when I occasionally do
get a chance to play games which has not
been a few months it's been a few months
since I've actually properly played a
game other than testing because we
basically work constantly with
benchmarking and content creation so
there's not enough time to really get
into stuff other than work so 780 works
fine for when I need it at some point
I'll upgrade actually as I keep tying
Andrew our video guy he to rebuild my
system extra month now I've been meeting
to build a new system with I think I
bought an i7 6700 K and I bought a good
amount of RAM and some other stuff and
then we made content with those products
instead and they haven't gone into a
system so I am using something that you
shouldn't build and you should instead
use our build guides for what to build
because I need the parts for content
creation so that the parts can generate
money so we can keep my heart content so
that's how this works maybe at some
point I'll retire something like a 780ti
into the system and build something
properly which is still an old card so
hopefully that answers that question
last question was from Super Mario who
said Steve I'm going bald any advice
Super Mario I would suggest maybe doing
one of those implants where he takes on
the mustache hairs and put them up there
and see if that works out for you
otherwise there was a good count reply
to this that suggested using thermal
paste on your head to sync the heat and
allow more hair to grow which I think
would probably work in my professional
advice so that's all for this video page
on commercial video thank you for
watching comments below for the
questions for the next video I'll see
you all next time
you
