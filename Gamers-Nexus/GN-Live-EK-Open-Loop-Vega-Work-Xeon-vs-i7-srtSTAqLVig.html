out momentarily we're trying live stream
number two today I'm going to be showing
off some of the ek waterblock stuff that
we just got in and I have to do a bunch
of stuff anyway so I have to tear down a
vega card and reclaim some stuff from it
has to tear down a 1080 ti4 project and
and then put stuff back together so
that's what we're working on today stuff
I'm doing anyway I thought we'd do a
stream and basically a QA plus work log
so if you have questions set them
through to chat we've got two moderators
in here who will be checking in from
time to time otherwise I will be I'll be
trying to keep an eye on chat myself so
okay stream is working I'm being told
okay good good we're off to a good start
let me get this link shared out to
Twitter and then we will start off with
the new ek babies first open loop that
they sent us why the stream is live
okay all right so everyone knows those
of you on discord if you are a patreon
backer and support us on patreon you can
go to the discord chat where we've got a
handout there otherwise this episode is
brought to you by our new shirts so this
one is covered in snowflake fur it does
not come with that you need to cat sold
separately
the shirts are on gamers Nexus
squarespace.com if you are interested in
them and we've got teal and grey and in
addition to the teal and grey we have
the tribe lens on the cotton so that's
what's brought to you for the episode
today and everyone seems to be
indicating that the stream is working so
awesome alright so we're gonna start
with finishing off this open loop I've
started this is like I said this is the
new ek setup what does this Yumiko this
is like the fluid gaming that's it so
this is their entry level open loop it's
supposed to compete with the closed loop
liquid coolers the CLC is the iOS as
some people call them I this is the
first one I've set up so I've done like
hardline tube bending before but I
haven't actually done any
real openly work we've just never needed
to and we've really specialized in
testing other things so this is the
first time working on something like it
was pretty easy to set up I haven't
tested it yet we haven't filled it yet
but the tubes they give you one big tube
to cut it so you cut that they give me
the fittings the barbs the plate and
radiator is not filled or anything so
this is actually empty and then you just
route everything and hook it all up and
and fill the loop from there so the
that's that's something I need to work
on we need to fill it and filling it is
going to require their cooling solution
which comes in the box and then distill
the water so we're gonna do that today
and I'm just keeping an eye on chat a
little bit as well so this is the
solution they call ek cryo fuel or
unique mixing that and with distilled
water and I think they want 100
milliliters of this and then let's see
the instructions they give I'm trying to
follow their instructions to the tee
because I want to see if it's easy to
follow as a real user as someone doing
this first time so pretty accurate from
that perspective hundred milliliters of
this 900 milliliters of distilled water
we have enough of each of those comes up
there Vardar fans and then we're also
going to be testing these fans on an
NZXT cooler and testing NZXT fans on
their cooler to see is an open-loop
actually just better and unless the pump
is something special or the coolant is
something special you'd expect probably
for these two products the answer might
be no but we'll find out very curious
about that alright so any any good
questions to start us off here the
motherboard looks bent yeah I don't know
it might be a little tweaked not really
oh it's just not uh it's not just there
you go okay problem solved it's a test
bench what do you want for me
all right so I think let's look at the
other kit that gave me and then fill it
this is the other kit it's a bit larger
we have a lot of cool
plans for this stuff because the the
thing is these come with GPU blocks as
well and then we have a couple of GP
blocks we've never reviewed open-loop
components this is upside down good
start and so what I want to show going
forward is some take some of our thermal
testing methodology and apply it to the
open-loop stuff to see if different cold
different full-coverage blocks perform
better than others we can measure the
fat temperatures the vram temperatures
stuff that you don't normally see and
really get an idea of how the
performances across the entire board not
just the GPU because GPU temperatures
are really kind of not the most
important thing once you're performing
well anyway so this is the tubing that
give you you have to cut it you kind of
mark it at the length you want to cut it
with scissors and just route it over the
barbs here's what the block looks like
and it does have the I don't know if
that's a nickel plated copper or
actually I think this is an all aluminum
loop isn't it where's the marking to be
used with other aluminum parts only yes
so this is a hundred percent aluminum
everything in this one so there's no
there's no copper for the cold plate
because they don't want galvanic
corrosion what else is what's up with
the keyboard backlight I don't know is
it flickering or something that's
probably just the camera refresh is it
flickering it's probably camera refresh
the next one to look at is we've got the
Barb and the fitting here so I've
already attached all this stuff and and
we're just using the smaller version of
this we're starting with the what is
this a 240 kit and then we'll be going
to this kit later which
is for the GPUs and things like that as
well
so that'll be fun to test but stuff
we're working on there's water cooling a
good option for an area that regularly
hovers around 90 Fahrenheit I don't know
you mean like your ambient temperature I
know that it can only cool to the rooms
ambient temperature that is I mean yeah
unless you do some kind of exotic
cooling you just physically can't get
below ambient so if is your room ambient
really ninety Fahrenheit that's awfully
high if that's true then you're just
gonna be limited no matter what by that
but yeah I mean I don't know a closed
loop would probably do fine as well I
will find out for you haven't really
tested this yet okay so like I said I
haven't done this before we're going to
just follow I'm on the at the end of the
instructions already so around this step
here where we're doing the preparing the
cooling step and that requires the
coolant or the mixture for the coolant
and the distilled water which we have
and then we need to we need to mix it up
which I'm just gonna use this to stir it
which is a bracket for a liquid cooler
or something so what does this say we
need this says we need coolant comes in
concentrated form to prepare the liquid
cooling you must take a 100 milliliter
clear coolant concentrate which is
enclosed that's this 900 milliliters of
distilled water mixed properly before
pouring it into the loop so the white
guy said if you want your real expertise
with open loops
I'm sure Jay or any of them have you
covered if you're new to open loops and
you want to see what this the process
looks like from the perspective of
someone who has worked a lot with
components but not with open loops then
you've tuned in to the right part of the
channel I guess but everything I do here
may not be 100% correct so keep that in
mind as well we have what is this what
is this go to 500 milliliters okay and
we need about we need a thousand total
so we'll fill this twice so we're gonna
do half of each so we'll do 50
milliliters of coolant and then 450 of
distilled water and that'll get us up to
500 then we'll mix that and then we'll
pour it into the into the actual loop
which let me just open the reservoir now
so the reservoir it's already attached
over here and it's a pump and reservoir
combo I think you just my hands have
distilled water on them I think you just
twist it okay cool so easy and I've just
a threaded cap and I've got the ek logo
in there I don't know if that lights up
or anything but I'd be shocked if it
doesn't at this point there's a loop
work with Gatorade
you could yes you could put Gatorade in
there probably be good for anything
didn't the J do some kind of test like
that I think they did some kind of test
like that all right I don't think it
matters what we do first let's just go
with the one we have the most of so
we're going up to 450 so about 450 that
looks like about 450 a little more
welcome to the gamers Nexus cooking show
so 450 there and now we need 50 of the
other stuff and then we'll do that again
to fill the loop the rest the way I'm
expecting you to sharpie on the Pyrex
you know I actually did want to write no
food on there it's not a Sharpie near me
I forgot to do that before the show Jade
didn't test Gatorade I'm being told all
right so let's see stream is stalling a
bit one person says anyone I was getting
a stream stall
what do we need to like let me just read
this just to just to see what it says so
ek a proven formula bla bla bla
marketing text mixing ratio for Best
Performance confirms what we already
know 1 to 9 mixing ratio shake before
use alright so we need to do that anyone
curious about ingredients synergistic
corrosion inhibitors water-based dyes
scale and biological inhibitors so a
biocide is in there which makes sense
don't feed this to your unborn child
okay stream is good here stream is
perfect okay so I'm seeing most people
saying that the stream is good pop it in
and then stir shake yeah you know that
makes sense to you but I've got a stir
with me I'm not honored or something
positive if that's actually necessary
step but whatever we'll just play it
play it play it safe stop shaking
are we going up to 500 we're going up to
500 with this which should be about half
the container I think okay anyone who
has done this before in chat I want to
know from you do I stir it at this point
UK indicates that you should mix the
mixture properly before pouring it into
the reservoir which leads me to believe
that I should stir it
what's encoding the stream and I 970 900
X is encoding the stream because it's
next to this table and that was the
easiest here's waiting on chat to catch
up for the answers is Mayo a coolant
probably not a good one
all right so yes lightly stir yes I have
this kit I think okay I'm not gonna test
toothpaste you can stir it yes all right
so let's go ahead and start I appreciate
the chat insight on this like I said I'm
not afraid to admit that this is the
first time I'm working with any kind of
open-loop it looks like it's pretty much
already all all dispersed and mixed
together so I don't know that we need to
do much more there this Rison 1700 close
the FPS gap to Intel at 4k well 4k it
becomes a GPU test comes a GP bottleneck
so as long as your GPU sustains 4k
really they should be more or less the
same actually we did test that 1440p and
Rison was only a couple FPS behind that
launch and might be tied and now that
the memory is a bit better we meet this
phone
so yes I think that answers that
question if you stick a small heatsink
up to a Peltier cooler and dip it into
the reservoir of a loop what it results
in a cooler water temperature events
that reservoir I mean I guess if you're
applying anything that's lower than
ambient to your cooling solution then it
should drop below ambient it's just a
matter of how much volume is there
versus the whatever solution you're
using thinking of doing an open loop
myself so glad you're doing the stream
I'm glad to hear David thank you for the
donation and does tubing the diameter
matter why or why not you know like I
said I'm new to this very specific
aspect of the coolant world so I can't
answer that but maybe some folks in chat
can that's the kind of thing this is why
I'm excited about this because going
forward the more we get to work with
this open-loop stuff there are all kinds
of questions like that that I really
want to answer myself and that will
include a lot of testing so as part of
that process I'm really looking forward
to testing things like tubing diameter
testing things like different blocks or
full-coverage blocks versus one another
and and getting an idea of different
parameters of cooling and what matters
and what doesn't because we haven't had
a chance to play with it there's not a
lot of testing out there for some of
that more specific stuff so really
looking forward to it first GM
livestreams second one actually so the
first one we did a we dismantled a
cooler master cooler okay so yeah yeah
drop some water onto the bench doesn't
matter so at this point where we've
pretty much filled this what's the next
step that we need to like turn it on and
get it do a leak test I can do that
without powering the board so there's no
risk let's see so step two remove the
top cover we did that take the pre-mixed
coolant and pour it into the reservoir
until the coolant level is about two
centimeters below the top I should have
read that part
first but I think we're we just so
happen to be about that part anyway
check again if you have plugged in the
EK bridging plug and cable pump testing
adapters correctly yes we know how to do
that i think and then do the leak
testing procedure paper towels on top of
and around your gear just in case yeah
not a bad idea okay so where's their
leak testing procedure let's just follow
their procedure I'm thinking I'm
thinking power the power supply plug it
into the pump and let it go that's what
I'm thinking is the leak testing
procedure but let's just do exactly what
they say to get a better idea of EK is
approach to this what page does it say
it's on it's on page it's 24 oh that
over here oh no we already did that okay
call leak testing procedures right there
put the cap on yeah I'll do that in a
moment
okay disconnect power supply we've
already done that this is not connected
to a functioning system right now
requires the pump to be connected to
power supply everything else needs to be
disconnected yep got that plug the
bridging plug and closed to your 24 pin
cable okay I mean it's just a glorified
paperclip is what that is so we've done
that and what's next connect the power
supply cable
okay yes we're just powering it so we're
doing basically what I was what I was
saying mandatory to do the following
unplug the pump four pin pwm connector
from the motherboard fan header if
already installed okay we have not
installed that plug the four pin into
the three pin fan connector includes on
the ek kit alright any other important
things here don't forget to add more
coolant you just added half yes right
I'm with you okay you know there's
another interesting question in chat
which is how much does the coolant
matter and that's another one of the
things I'm really excited about getting
into testing
once we have some good open-loop stuff
set up and going and really working we
can look at that kind of thing see does
it actually make a noticeable difference
now there are a million variables for
thermals it's always a huge problem but
that's okay we you know you do the best
you can within the within the space
you're working in for the audience
you're targeting you do the best to
appeal to those specific user needs you
declare the shortcomings of the testing
methodology declare the possible caveats
and then you do your best with testing
so even though there are a lot of
different variables I think we can do a
good job of at least getting some
questions out of the way you know if
this leaks it's no big deal just go down
to the floor we're gonna move the power
cable out of the way though so none of
those get liquid in them so that would
be suboptimal for anyone who is not
aware of this step so this is not
special to liquid coin this is what they
ship as a bridge kit they're calling it
and you can buy these too if you you
ever wonder about these all it's doing
is bridging two cables it's the same on
every power supply and it's to jump your
PSU so this is a cool trick for
troubleshooting if you don't know
already what you do is you locate the
where is it the green let me get this
kind of visible you locate the green
cable which is over here and any black
ground cable and then you just bridge
them with a paper clip and as long as
you do that the power supply will turn
on now it doesn't always sometimes it
needs a bit of a load which you can
achieve with a solid-state drive or
better yet a fan and that'll put enough
load on its get most those to turn on
this kit just makes it easy for you hold
it in place so it's not gonna move
around definitely not necessary yeah you
can just use a paper clip like I said so
run the pump for a second then fill
again okay got it let's try that so our
pump is hooked up over here we're not
using the ek plug but it shouldn't
really matter it's just power
so we're going down here to the power
supply power supply is now on let me
just cut the power straight away just to
make sure nothing Crazy's happening okay
all right so that looks okay we do need
more liquid in there you know what let's
so this power supply has a long kind of
a shutdown period it's still spinning
like the fan spinning there's no power
going through it so we are going to we
are going to let that stop okay it
stopped let's get the rest of this in
there so this is only half the solution
keep in mind
okay
okay I'm just checking chat again them
all we kind of wait for that for a
moment keep it on and add water fast but
carefully okay yes that pump did seem
fast you don't have to cap it yeah if
that makes sense as long as it's not
gonna spew water out which it's not a
blender it's a pump so I guess shouldn't
do that let me just let me just monitor
it let's let's see how the pump behaves
it is in fact not spewing water
everywhere all right sounds like a
dentist's office
I'm not gonna turn this board on right I
mean we're gonna wait if there's any
liquid anywhere we're gonna wait a good
while as long as there's no power to the
board it's not gonna get hurt so okay
it's looking good we're still only half
of the it's it is shooting some liquid
at the top but like I said pumps not
gonna board talk gonna be turned on
today so just kind of put that right
there for a minute and I'm just gonna
leave that unscrewed in for now no don't
close it yes that resin no no no no no
no no no no okay
we have a couple of these kids by the
way so should be good to go on
everything
is this the aluminum cat yes this is the
aluminum kid
everything in here is aluminum all right
let's leave that like that let's see I
know you leakage on the radiator no no
leakage on the radiator no leakage on
the block
you have trapped at the top of the red
what motherboard is that it is an X 99
EVGA board now you just need to tilt it
and try to get the air out of the
radiator okay I just let it bleed got it
okay so it sounds like at this point it
needs to sit radiator needs to be turned
upside down remove all the bubbles
inside that is getting caught else you
will not be able to get it filled 100%
in the performance will be bad okay so
it sounds like the consensus is to
remove the radiator which I'm curious if
they mentioned let's see they mention
that in here
Harris buying coolant pushed from the
reservoir it's the water cooling
components you have to fill the cone
continuously while that's going Mike
won't let will become steady which is
where we are right now fill the
reservoir so that the coolant levels
about two centers below the edge screw
the top back on clockwise direction
shake and tilt the chassis to remove any
possible air trapped in the radiator you
may need to add more coolant so they do
actually mention it okay cool so let me
just check chat see what other
suggestions there are if like the tubes
to move the bubbles along you know it
seems like a good idea okay well let's
give that a try first unless it's just
like a trick to make you look stupid on
stream you can actually see the air
bubbles coming through there that's
pretty cool
okay cool so it does appear to be
actually actually helping you know I
didn't have enough faith in you all I
thought it was just gonna be a can we
make him look stupid but it is actually
moving the air bubbles Ilana okay you
can see that right and we could tilt the
radiator as well it sounds like which
would require just mounting it and would
make me a little make me have to close
stuff back up yeah so hey why don't you
ever do open loops I've just never
needed to you know we specialize on
things like testing GPUs CPUs I do a lot
of thermals but
with an open loop so it's new to me
pretty cool though I am going to try and
tilt the radiator without spilling
coolant everywhere so let's let's
dismount the radiator I am I'm gonna go
ahead and cap this just for a minute
before chat freaks out it should still
bleed air even if it's capped because
there's space at the top of the
reservoir but I'd rather do this then
spill stuff everywhere so
and then i'll uncap at once i've got the
screws out of here and i know it's not
gonna just pull the radiator or the
reservoir over okay
all right so I think we're good okay
there's a bunch of air okay
with her hat in a five-gallon bucket of
ice water not right now
all right so I guess we're in the
bleeding process here there does
according to e K's instructions we do
need well I don't know actually they did
say put the put the extra back into a
closed container so so we might not
actually need any more of this but if
you're for those experience with open
loops go ahead let me know hey Steve put
the now okay not reading that there we
go there's a bunch of air so let me know
how long do you normally allow this
thing to bleed is this like a few hours
leave it alone process or is it quicker
than that is the pump loud it sounds
loud on stream I think a lot of that
sound you're hearing is from the power
supply the pump is definitely making
some noise but they probably I mean I
you can't really judge audio from from
what you hear on the stream because the
my mic is like right next to it so it's
gonna sound louder than in reality
till about 45-degree angle smack the
radiator edges will bleed better okay
how much time behind this YouTube
streaming you know I'm not sure the
answer to that not too long okay 45 and
let's just there's some air coming out
okay cool
bleed for 2 minutes turn it 180 degrees
every 10 seconds during the 2 minute
process I bleed for a few hours then
open the cover of the res to vent the
pressure that makes sense
closed reservoir shake rad a little bit
okay let's do that
just kind of sip that right there
forty-five to sixty years to bleed
hahaha we talking like existentially or
stats from there or 30 seconds delay on
YouTube okay give them now okay cool
there's a bunch of air
so I think the rest of the solution is
going to be accessed we do hat we can
pour some more in
while the tubes are upwards that also
makes sense because then your air goes
up to the top okay cool cool cool cool
everyone's gonna be like why are you
smashing it but the mic makes it sound a
lot worse than it is
is the ek fluid gaming 240g with nvidia
10 series block the one I have on the
floor next to me came with a 10 series
block yes I think they have an AMD block
as well and we got the 10 series one
just because we have some plans for
testing with it
okay reservoir higher than the rest of
the loop yeah we kind of almost done
leak test is now the long part okay
yeah radiator testing would be fun I
agree that's that's part of why I'm
doing this because I you know I need to
learn the process first and once we've
got everything you know once once I know
what I'm doing with this stuff we can
start doing some really cool tests but
you have to know your weak spots and
knowledge and mine with with this you're
gonna be open loops and power supply
testing so I'm okay with learning it yes
aluminum make sure the waterline of the
res is higher than everything else in
the loop I suppose you mean right
will bleed on its own either way over
the first hour
little to no air in the pump top off as
needed okay so I'm gonna unless there's
a strong reason not to I'm going to
remount this back to back to our
radiator mounting Pole otherwise I can
just kind of sit it down over here oh I
guess that's okay I'll leave it there
that that achieves the reservoir being
higher aspect okay what is everyone
saying about that decision is this the
first time Steve is doing water clean
for open-loop yes for those just tuning
in this is the first time I'm doing
open-loop like I said
we're okay with with learning it
publicly because going forward it's it
really opens a lot of doors for us for
testing and really cool stuff I want to
do with thermals it's gonna take some
time to get there as I learn about open
loops what we know enough people in the
industry to help out on the way you're
good Steve mount it okay well I really
appreciate that I recognize that user
name Dominator I recognize that one from
comments appreciate the oversight let's
get this mounted and then move on to the
next project while it does whatever it
needs to do
then people experience with this stuff
feel free to let me know what I need to
do something else but otherwise it looks
like we're just keeping an eye on on the
water levels at this point and the leak
testing I think we should be leak free
but we'll see computers not I further
again those are just tuning in the
system on the bench is not powered we
are only powering the pump this will
prevent any serious destruction of
components in the event that there is a
leak allows us to see you know just
focus on the loop basically so we're
just focusing on the loop right now
we'll worry about the system and once
it's time to worry about the system
it's gonna kind of little cockeyed okay
all right cool okay so what leave it
like that for now I love your videos
keep it up thank you Maddy Johnson for
the donation much appreciated I need to
be sure you are leak free yes do not
worry I am going to be running it all
night I'll put some paper towels out
around it and things as any remaining
air bleeds you'll see the water levels
and the rez drop add as necessary to
keep the pump wet yep sounds good okay
all right the res doesn't have to be the
highest the bubbles will either settle
at the top or they'll be sucked into the
pump and go through another lap yes I
follow you okay so at this point we're
at a lot of things that I'm familiar
with from closed loops so was there
anything else I needed to deal with this
right now
oh yeah right I'm gonna put a couple of
these out just to keep an eye on just so
I can look at them and see if they've
gotten wet when we check it later
see if there's any leakage
okay leave that there the US will just
cover this side
nothing should really be coming out of
there and for this one I'll just drop
this underneath for right now okay all
right okay next project unless there's
something else I need to do right now
immediately the next project is going to
be dismantling Vega once again gonna
need to let me follow up on some of the
questions here that are being sent to me
by our moderators spirit of nuts says
any plans to review the ekw BM to
heatsink like you did the MSI heat
shield not right now I said this in one
of the ASCII or in the news video
the trouble with cooling SSDs is that
you really you really need to ideally
not cool the flash and then cool the
controller so the flash actually doesn't
mind being warm in fact it's technically
better for endurance I'm not sure how
much better I don't know if it's
appreciable by the user especially in a
non data center environment but you're
really not supposed to to cool the flash
with like liquid or something because
it's it's just not ideal for it now I'm
avoiding words like saying not good for
it because even though it's not ideal
I'm not enough of an expert in it I
don't know if getting the flash ten
degrees cooler removes any appreciable
amount of life from the flash any
endurance or if it's just totally
relevant for people like us as opposed
to data center or enterprise or
something like that
so it's really tricky project to do oh
wow 50 quid donation thank you Paul T P
12 Cora
great vit all right get get vid keep it
up thank you very much for that much
appreciated and all the others as well I
think I answered that is the pump loud
question the answer is it sounds louder
probably to you than it actually is it's
not bad the power supply is kind of loud
though
yeah so I don't know about the EK the em
to block we might start testing more of
those Steve stress or what do you got
for me so a few people asking if they
include a ball valve for draining in the
kit I'm actually not sure about that
actually the next page has the has the
draining steps I think draining the loop
so let's see what they say
if you wanted to drain the loop they say
unscrew the 4m for not securing the EK
pump bracket so that would just be
removing the pump and reservoir combo
and then step to unscrew the fittings so
those are the ones that were already on
there when we started the stream I
pointed those out pull the tube off let
the coolant flow into the container so I
don't think it has what you're asking
about but I'm not positive all right a
lot of suggestions to cycle the pump
speed to knock out the bubbles okay so
do I have a good way to do that right
now I need a fan controller to do that
what do you kick it was on there kit for
this the Jetta hype bra approves thank
you Jedi bra
much appreciated speaking of we've gotta
knock Toa fans on the way for for
testing their China I versus Taiwan
Origin fans I don't suspect we'll see a
difference thermally or acoustically but
it's possible so we're gonna test them
I'm in communications with Noctua
there is no ball valve guys someone says
so that answered that question so I'm in
talks with Noctua
and we'll know more soon and hopefully
have a large sample size to work with
from both them and from stuff I'm buying
myself some readers are sending stuff in
so it'll be a fun test but that that
starts next week I need to get all that
stuff in first here's the rest of the
hardware let me give this so that you
guys can actually see in the box okay
next super chat green ohm thank you for
the donation much appreciated
ok so this is the rest of the stuff that
includes the back plates things like
that for mounting to the board we don't
need any of that today this is just a
four pin cable Bridge cable and then a
SATA power for the pump which we're
already doing with molex with a kid that
I have separately so I would need to
hook up a fan controller to cycle the
pump speed I think but ok we're gonna
leave that alone for a bit unless
something major goes wrong with it I'm
just gonna let it sit it'll take a while
to figure out if it's actually leaking
or not from what I've read in from what
everyone's saying anyway for jion's give
a comprehensive fan no come back come
back
fan or air cooler oh it's gone it's gone
I'm sorry which have buried that
question I'll never be found again if
the question was about fan and cooler
tests or cooler in case testing we do
that the quest was about fantastic I'm
not sure I don't think we're getting too
deep into that territory right now today
it is something that I'm looking at
we're doing it for naktu as a one-off if
it goes well if we have a methodology
we're happy with we'll learn some stuff
along the way you know the first time
you do a major test like the knock to a
feature piece we're doing hopefully you
find a lot of flaws along the way so you
can improve your test for publication
and then hopefully to you find things
really like you know this is kind of
inadequate we can do better than this
and develop it as you go so I try to
start small scale with one test and go
from there just power cycle the whole
system to cycle the pump ok well
easy let's just do that again this power
supply takes a second about ten seconds
to turn off completely
so I gotta let it stop spinning okay
alright so we've cycled I don't see a
lot of air bubbles going through ok
cycle a gun we've cycled the gun yeah
there's some air bubbles ok cool it's
working all right
like I said gonna leave that alone I
love your videos greetings from Canada
thank you Andrew much appreciated
ok so next thing we have to do this is
gonna sit here in the background and
look pretty a while I once again
dismantle Vega that's pretty quick
process now done enough times if you're
wonder what these are these are
thermocouples coming out of there that
we use for thermal testing and next we
need to just pull the I need to reclaim
some stuff from the board take it apart
again and and then we'll move on to the
next card this one's pretty quick so if
you did not just the right size if you
did not see our Vega teardown
you're about to see a very quick version
of it but it's basically a couple screws
in the back these are a torque six
torque six these are the large ones if
the Jedi approves six six six Gina also
up here's thank you
six six six gene from the patreon
discord chat if you're not familiar with
the patreon discord chat you can support
us at patreon.com slash Gary's Nexus
which will give you access to our
discord where I hang out with people in
there on and off throughout the day and
it's a pretty good time good way to get
some ideas from the community so for
example that under-voltage Vega testing
a lot of that I was talking with Street
guru in there for a little while who
gave me some of the ideas for that test
in and we developed on it put together a
pretty cool content piece and then we're
doing the same for another feature test
we have going on right now
so we can bounce questions off a sort of
a focus group community and get a better
idea for what people are interested in
seeing in a form that is more controlled
than YouTube comments which are just
impossible to keep up with because
there's so many of them content very
detailed cube high quality content come
in thank you I appreciate that and thank
you
stress byte for posting the link in chat
stress the bytes helping us out as a
moderator today there one say hi to
stress byte and chat
okay so we are yes I I haven't done this
in two days so I've already forgotten
things once you get the back plate off
you reveal the Philips screws underneath
pretty simple process at this point all
right if we cannot do that that'd be
great let's get a better head on there
okay okay one
all right so we are dismantling Vega
once again to reclaim some stuff from it
and why I say reclaim I mean basically
take back my thermocouples so I can put
them on other things or really just to
get them out of there because I want
this card to be restored to stock we are
keeping this card a couple people asked
you know it's it's expensive
that was another video card yeah
thinking about are you going to return
it the original plan was maybe to resell
it or something like that but you know
as we got into it and really start
digging into the thin realized we can
make return on this we can make return
on the thousand dollars it'll at least
equalize itself and come out at zero if
not profit and so we can keep the card
and use it for regression testing and do
some cool feature tests with it like the
voltage stuff and it'll also allow us to
test the card with once rx figure comes
out yes he is there a meaningful
difference between that method do the
drivers change anything stuff like that
the next project after this it's gonna
be dismantling a 1080i so those are you
just tuning in this stream is basically
my list of laundry list of things that I
have to do today and we're just
streaming a lot of them because it's
really no trouble to do so and it's kind
of fun and honestly chat was incredibly
helpful setting up that open-loop first
time I've done one of those I'm really
excited about learning more about that
side of the PC world so that we can add
some unique insights from testing it'll
take a little while to get there but
hope from the community speeds things
along and that is the ek fluid gaming is
that it was the name of this thing fluid
gaming UK fluid game and that's what
we're working with any other questions
in chat I mean that well I'm just
putting a pause on this so I can check
up on everyone so one question Luke
asked not not the one for - actives
while
here are seven 1700 vid could you
delegate streaming and coding to a
second GPU in the same system I have a
Titan X Pascal say if I had a 1060 could
I chuck that in to improve performance
I'll get to that one second oh and the
question I missed earlier Oh 3z many
anyway said for GN to give a
comprehensive fan air-cool in guide the
pc cases funny you say that we've been
working on something like that and we
have actually done some things like that
in the past every review we do for cases
is kind of an optimization guide for
that specific case but we can certainly
do more yeah now back to the first
question streaming so one thing we
didn't talk about in that test was using
something like envy encoder or AMD's
equivalent encoder which the name
escapes me a vce is that VCE I think so
you could use one of those envy encoder
certainly would take the load off the
GPU you really improve things a lot in
terms of solving for a CPU limitation
but one you need a more powerful GPU to
make sure you can keep up with it and to
the wives tale so to speak is that
there's a quality degradation when you
start streaming to be a GPU we can
coding via GPU and I actually have not
tested that in an objective way yet so I
don't know what kind of quality loss
there is certainly there's plenty of
subjective discussion out there were
people for sure hate GPU encoding but it
certainly helps out when necessary now
one thing in the video i wished i had
spoken about this more i talked about it
in the article but not in the video and
so the thing is with with streaming so
one thing we can add is you could do a
separate box so you could actually do an
external capture box and the reason
those are useful that we didn't discuss
in the video because just i mean it
didn't really occur to me until after
and I started writing the article hence
the articles
always great to have because I normally
have some post film and editing insight
where I realize something
so the r7 and the i7 both had one issue
and that was with the frame time
consistency so the even though r7 which
by all accounts did great overall even
though r7 was lower in its 0.1% fps we
call it which is really just a
recalculated frame time into an FPS
number that more people generally
understand but if you'll get a frame
time graphic kind of spikes like that
and the the problem with frame times
being variable like that is that once
you kind of get out of the 8 millisecond
difference range frame the frame the
user starts noticing there might be
stuttering it might be just like a
freeze if it's really bad which we
didn't see in those benchmarks the most
part but if you did an external capture
box and this is what I didn't talk about
you solve for that and you keep your
frame time consistency because you're
not hammering the GP or the CPU with
encoding on the gaming system so if you
do if you're a professional streamer who
does that kind of thing for money daily
and maybe our competitive csgo or
something then an external box isn't a
bad idea because your frame time
consistency will be untouched by the
streaming solution but now that was just
something I wanted to mention because we
only really got to talk about it in the
article and I dropped frames here are
happening on the computer side the
stream is very even ok great to hear
ok so that's what was I even doing here
let's finish this it's kind of hard to
do when you're splitting your attention
I haven't needs to do that alright so
are all the screens we got all the
screws let's pull this electrical tape
off we don't need that on there anymore
that was for the liquid coin project got
all those let's get the ones out of the
expansion area I like this screwdriver
it seems annoying
yes it is pretty warm it's probably like
seventy six or seven in here right now
air conditionings not working very well
and we're in North Carolina where lately
it's been in the upper 90s or a heat
index of over a hundred on some of the
days so it is quite warm and I've got
2000 LEDs pointed out my face that is
that is the answer to those questions I
need a smaller one for this
all right
okay so we're about to reclaim these
thermocouples I'll have to reassemble
the thin and then we'll move on and that
will pretty much wrap up all the stuff
on my to-do list today in terms of
assembly disassembly
this is always a bit faster if you don't
have to show the camera what you're
doing but it's more fun this way
I'll check try it again in a second I
just finished this so we've got a Andrew
Coleman on the camera he can't see what
you're saying in chat because he's busy
but show your appreciation how are we
doing over there you need a break
getting the thumbs up
I fix a giveaway when I don't know we
did run ads with them for a while I
think the coupon codes expired now
though unfortunately okay can your
cameraman talk yes he is not miked
alright so I've got this you've all seen
this at this point let's wanna borrow
this from the leak testing area clean
this thing off you sure that was a
thumbs-up
good job Angeles Hey yeah so you know we
thought it would we thought it would be
fun to do live streams with a live
camera rather than a fixed camera with
and like seated or something get all
this crap off of here and it definitely
is takes a bit more logistical work but
it is it is pretty fun and it makes us
way more mobile so we can do cool stuff
like this and you can actually see
everything that's going on hey that's
good enough for now I don't need this to
be perfect this instant now I need some
thermal paste that's probably usable
and if Patrick is in chat he's been
running some feature tests that we're
gonna publish working in one of the
other rooms as he knows and will attest
to you don't work a day here without
getting thermal paste on your hands just
like an auto shop except instead of
grease it is thermal paste thermal
grease I suppose I reclaim this one
see if have you get let me catch that
question that it looks like a good one
have you guys been using what have you
guys been using for thermal paste during
testing so we we do actually use the
same thermal paste for all the the
thermal tests comparative I do some out
of box tests with the stock paste and
keep an eye on it when I replace it just
to make sure that they haven't used
something truly garbage but the stuff we
use you lock the camera first I can grab
me like the tooth they don't pay stubs
I'll show you guys what we use just one
second we've shown it before but okay so
I've reclaimed these all right cool
thank you okay so this is a type of
thermal paste we have two of these so
what we use is was something actually
done with the ek loop already yeah we
basically built there was the first open
loop built I've done it is currently
leak testing oh there he how that's
that's that's about half a pound of
thermal paste we've got two of them he
is the same stop for every test all the
coolers all the GPUs and it helps make
sure there's consistency and results we
just fill syringes with them and they'll
probably one a day and go through a
whole bunch of thermal paste every day
thanks to a stack for supply now that
actually comes from their factory it's
pretty good stuff which is why I use it
but I don't think you can buy it
separately so it's unfortunate but
there's plenty of get thrown paste out
there
I'll check questions in a second let me
get the rest of this off all right this
is a non-conductive tape basically yeah
is that good
yes this is all good okay all right okay
so now that we've got that in a state of
some kind I catch up with everyone is it
non-conductive yes it is non-conductive
how much thermal paste is required for
thread Ripper I have no idea that's a
great question
thread Ripper we don't we don't know
there's a lot of questions about thread
Ripper because you can theoretically you
would be able to cool the thing just
fine as long as the cold plate is still
contacting the area above the die on the
IIHS you don't have to get full yhs
contact everywhere in theory now I also
think performance is probably improves
by contacting the whole IHS but
technically you'll really only need it
right where the die is and so you're
gonna see a lot of manufacturers take
existing cold plates that are suitable
for X 99 X 299 and just take them on to
threader per because it'll still cover
the die area so I'm really curious to
see how much does that impact
performance if you cover the entire IHS
versus not next question is uh I've got
one sent to me by Patrick says syntax of
five says please do some custom McCool
in mods using different rated tech
modules most other videos out there are
amateur hour and don't cover proper
testing our temps on GPS and CPUs I'll
look into it if anyone wants to follow
or if if syntax five you want to follow
up with me on that or anyone else
we sent a tweet that gamers Nexus with
some more information or or way I can
get in contact with you and we'll look
into it but I will warn you right now
we're basically backed up for like two
weeks at least because it's we know
thread rippers launch and we know let me
cover this we know RX Vega is launching
so it's gonna be nothing but those two
things for at least a few weeks so
we'll be a while but I do keep a list of
like basically cool ideas for when we
have a week of downtime how much thermal
paste is required I answered that one
let's see what stress by it says anyway
for Jia oh yeah we got that one - okay
cool we are on top of things right now
and then no not it will sense a super
chat thank you for that one
okay all right okay what so let's close
this thing back up I don't have any
thermal paste oh wait yes I do I do have
their own pace I am going to get rid of
this on conductive tape let's clean this
a little bit more does not need to be
perfect okay not bad and we're gonna
restore the same let me grab a thermal
paste wrench give me about ten seconds
I guess I'm miked wirelessly so oh you
know I got something quality inch off
here
okay so we had a thing where we needed
thermal pads recently for that
that's a tack card and I found you can
just I wish you could buy a bigger sheet
than this but this is it what is this a
250 by 250 millimeter sheet just a huge
a throne pad basically Arctic thermal
pad this one I think is does it say on
here this one might be 0.5 millimeters
in lecture not sure but yeah well I have
some passes some some pads I want to do
some testing on tears infinite testing
that can be done it's just matter of
what what real obligations do you have
what stuff do you really have to review
like this ek thing I've been sitting on
I need to review that the only reason it
takes a while because I hadn't done an
open loop before so again thank you to
chat for helping out and the plan is
even though I haven't done open loops
before I do want to test it versus all
of that you see this I just want to test
their versus how the CLC is we have we
do a good job testing that I think and
test the different fan like the same fan
on the on different coolers and see when
does it matter when is it better what's
the performance noise normalized at 40
DBA what's performance noise normalize
40 DB a if we swap fans around stuff
like that
behind-the-scenes something that must be
done sometimes several times a day
that should be enough for today
okay I'm gonna repay this bigger card
now you know before I do that I should
clean this as well
we pasted that way people can argue and
chat about how much paste is enough or
not enough like always I have a theory
about that I think people in comments
and chat and things tend to argue more
about the stuff that they have some
hands-on with so people have applied
their own taste and everyone's got their
own way of doing it even though
ultimately it doesn't matter all that
much as long as you're reasonable GPS do
you take a bit more though than CPU is
just because it doesn't have an IHS and
you really want to make sure you cover
everything you have anything that's not
covered on the silicon you're gonna have
a bad time when stuff starts burning out
camera is not shaking its the table
that's good enough okay all right that's
what we go for here
this is non-conductive I saw another
person ask that a bit ago
I actually worth that thing a little
leakage okay
okay all right that seems suitable
what's everyone saying
I love how he hides it yeah well I mean
I already know what the counts are gonna
be whether or not I do exactly enough so
why would I encourage them it's like
training a dog that's what you all are
doing
you're training us what things can and
can't be shown
okay we're most the way there when are
we going to see the NZXT puck XL and X X
ow
bro do you lift I notice you have
calluses I do not lift there's videos on
the channel GN Steve I'll plug our side
channel that we just launched GN Steve
has some of my downhill biking videos
from snowshoe and other mountains are we
going to Whistler later this year upload
some stuff there so no no lifting but
there is downhill biking puck XL and X
exhale you know I don't know that I want
boxes that are four times the size
showing up with pucks anyone have you
got does everyone know the story of
these do we fish these right here the
NZXT parks how did that start
oh that's 340 elite review that's 340
elite review I liked the case overall I
had some things I talked about thermals
and stuff like that
thermal like I mean like most cases that
are of that kind of build and yeah it's
Vega Fe so I said about the park that
NZXT was very proud of it which they
were this is the puck and I called it a
piece of rubber and plastic or something
like that I think so yeah let's park
that's that's their Valentine's card
they sent us to so they've got a good
sense of humor about it since I was
actually critical of the park it's not
bad it's just like I was basically like
why don't you brag about this you have
so many other cool things on the case to
talk about why are you wasting marketing
space on this thing but alas they showed
me because we just spent two minutes
talking about the puck no es D this mat
is ESD and only we're an ESD wrist strap
I'm grounded it's fine don't worry about
it
I don't know if this is the right screw
or not no that's not the right screw
they just take the shorter screws I got
that fan situated okay and zxe about
their passive aggressiveness it's fun to
play along nothing wrong with that I
like I mean I much prefer I much prefer
that approach to criticism than like
shutting down and just not working with
reviewer anymore because they criticize
one aspect of your product where's that
smaller screw I picked up the same one
twice because I'm talking while doing
this it's a smaller screw this is a
smaller screw that's a smaller screw
that is not okay yeah normally I sort
these but kind of haphazard with chat
going
okay yes yes for what C's yeah honestly
that are like seriously we do we're like
grounding straps for stuff it's
connected to this table and then we have
an ties to these blue mats or
anti-static mats so I do take it pretty
seriously where is the where's the last
screw should have sorted these this it
that looks like it
18 spare parts when he's done with this
alright so we just at this point let
some let's screw in the base plate
this is all Phillips screws from here
and then we'll be running into some of
the Torx six and five in a moment
actually I need to line this up at the
back of the basic backplate I let's up
with the back plate alright so we need
to put screws put a scrim there
they screw over here all I'm doing is
adding screws where there aren't spaces
in the back plates alike
hang on let me show you so a back plate
pretty easy these are the Torx six and
then everything else that's not one of
those as a Phillips screw so another one
of those will be a here
right here here okay
what's the project their own paste
replacement the project is reclaiming
thermocouples we already did the ek loop
it was the first open loop I've done
chat helped out with it
it is currently leak testing now we are
well we just finished reclaiming
thermocouples for another test and I'm
just reassemble in the Vega card so that
we can go back to using it for normal
testing and rx Vega a competitive
testing once that's the thing I know
that one doesn't kick get a screw this
one does Matthew donates $1 thank you
very much for that well it's reassemble
it isn't reassembled correctly unless
you have spare parts left over well said
zdg absolutely although this one will be
your he assembled correctly as I look
for screws last one I think this sounds
like I'm getting discord nice oh you
know what did I ever meet this Court on
this is anyone complained where's that a
mixer oh yeah mixer
oh it is meat it ok good didn't make the
same mistake toys ok got all those so we
need that screw okay alright cool
this last this I mean hopefully this
kind of shows you in an unedited format
like how easy it is to dismantle a video
card for anyone who hasn't done this
before
obviously at your own risk all that
stuff try to ground or use anti-static
surfaces or if not those use services
that don't insulate very much for
example a hard table or something as
opposed to like a carpet where you get
insulation and static discharge
oh wait did I plug in the fan now I
don't let's do that first
I don't trouble with cables today all
right cable
this one sucks to reconnect it's just
not very long
he's led chaos led chaos and never long
enough and they're never worth it
alright there we go
okay let me see also where's that screw
I need a Phillips screw over here and
that's gonna connect to where's my back
my plate okay so that's gonna connect to
the plate
okay we gotten all this stuff for the
most part yes okay all right keep those
cables that are just slightly too short
yeah I know they drive me crazy all
right so now we need that TR head
where's that to your head
TR five tier five I fix it's not an
active sponsor with us right now or an
act of advertiser I should say however I
do genuinely like this toolkit that's
why I'm using it even though they're not
like a sponsor or anything right now
this is another right screw where's that
screw also not the right screw no okay
these back plate back
there we go
okay I'll check chat in a moment anyone
second
so current project reassembly in Vega
after disassembling it to claim the
reclaim of the thermocouples I had on
there and previous project ek water
blocks fluid gamer series assembly one
more thing I have to do and then we're
gonna be done for the most part alright
okay so I will be checking chat and
about a minute which means if you start
posting your questions now it'll get to
me when I'm ready to check so if you
have questions now is a good time okay
Phillips torques there we go
damnit
oh it's not lined up there we go okay
here his neck says some guy said it's
what does that say bad to have the 1080
Strix overclocked 2125 who is some guy
where does he come from
some components get some comments get
too hot for that is that right GPO Tom
is 65
well the GPU attempt isn't the only
temperature I don't remember what we had
at overclocked to with that are you
talking about the Strix ROG 1080i
because we tested that and that's like
one of the best cards on the market for
in terms of like cooling and noise
efficiency so I'm not sure I agree vrm
components can take like a hundred
twenty-five C caps or like 105 °c
depending what kind of caps you're
talking about so it's really seems like
it's probably a non-issue
okay let's do this one
all right almost to the end of this one
always yeah yeah yeah any questions I'm
looking for questions performance
difference between identical speeds eons
and I so I do have that Zeon thing and
the title deny here's what I'm wondering
so we were we were playing around with a
render machine and it's not really
cutting it for the 4k stuff so I'm
looking at doing something with a CPU
maybe the GPU is in the video you'll see
we actually try a multi-gpu set up and
it really doesn't do anything for
premiere oh Sh and it helps greatly with
our other tasks with blender really
helped a lot 2x increase in speed but
does not help with Mir premiere likes
threads it's still capping out on the
threads so we're at a point where it's
like whoa what do we do do we upgrade to
some kind of Xeon like an X 79
compatible Xeon and use that because if
we there are x79 Zeon's that have an
extra four threads over what we have
which is a 49 60 X in that machine and I
would think it would probably help even
with the lower frequency let me check
microphones going crazy which means
probably discord and sweaty from heat
and lights
tap around the sides of the radiator
every 15 minutes okay let's do that we
haven't paid attention to that for a
little while
tap around it is that all it takes just
like looking for a hollow spot in the
wall looking for the studs in the wall
cycle the power again here okay I'm
about to just like pour this coolant on
my head I think what games are you
currently playing when you have the
times to you I don't know the last time
I played games like I mean I do but like
in a serious way like it used to be this
job we did I did 17 hours the other day
and redid about 12 that day so you know
you you're really just like grinding and
trying to get content out trying to do
cool tests the benchmarking is kind of
playing games but not really in a way
that you would want to for fun so I was
playing City skylines most recently I
really liked that game I liked city
builders a lot RTS was my home John rod
for a long time so city builders RTS I
pretty much grew up on a Age of Empires
series on red alert actually more than
Age of Empires and genre is all but dead
at this point but I am actually looking
I am I'm planning to properly play this
is tr6 anyone wondering properly plays
Starcraft whatever it is the remake you
guys know what I'm talking about
I really want to play that I used I
played it semi competitively ages ago
never in any serious fashion that was
actually relevant to the scene a or III
arrow is pretty competitive n but
Starcraft original Starcraft I mostly
just like the UMS Hydra D it was pretty
fun CHD was like one legends legacies I
want to say legacies that was a
really cool RPG map that I liked a lot
used to do like 40 hours of games a week
but not now
would you say this is a better cooler
design than always on the 480 reference
this one here yes the fans actually
pretty good on this this is a delta fan
it can pull 28 watts it pulls it through
the PCIe slot and very powerful
it's a vapor chamber cooler yes I would
say it is better than the rx 40
reference cooler what's the next
question do I have another one next one
is 280 red 70 700 K 4.9 gigahertz 1080
and Nano in a nano ass 70 Celsius CPU
during the 8 a 64 should I be worried no
70 is fine
you have nothing to worry about checking
my stuff from Patrick now do you game in
your free time or just benchmark all
these components have no timeout for
doing so I just answered that one from
Tony some suggestions to flip the rad so
that the air can't collect at the top ok
got it I will do that this is done we
have reclaimed the thermocouples mission
accomplished
all right any questions in chat I'm
checking it should be blood plenty right
now dominate her saying and JAMA Nader
was the one who helped earlier I'm gonna
go ahead and do it one more time just in
case
so Dominator anyone else in the chat
should I be opening the you know let's
just do that to let the air kind of
anything that's in there I don't think
this is actually a relevant thing to do
but I'll just open it for a second we're
still within eks demands for how much
liquids in there so they said what do
they say two centimeters from the top so
we got like they're all paste and debris
from that card everywhere on me so I
think we're still within that spec yeah
you know it would be nice if I could do
this without cross threading that okay
there we go okay
what we haven't yet I want to play
starcraft remastered yeah I know me too
when will you do a streaming PC only
test with CPUs
when will we do a streaming the only
test are you asking about the the one
that I that like we just published one
if you're new to the channel we have one
I don't know if that's what you mean
though
I saw another question what was that is
that plat Max and get with it which is
the PS you were using right now I don't
really we've been using it for a while
as just like an extra power supply for
the high wattage tests and it seems fine
it's platinum rated Johnny guru might
have a review of that one
so suggestion what was the suggestion
flip the rad we kind of already did this
I think but let's just do it anyway
it looks like it's blood pretty well I
think we're really just leak testing at
this point I didn't flip the rat again
in a bit the tubing's not really not
really gonna permit me to easily flip it
and mount it I could if I had more hands
and didn't have to share stuff off but
alright we'll worry about that later
yeah I think we're in leak testing phase
so far no leaks but it needs to run for
quite a while
okay all right any other questions
ad worries me I'm guessing that's about
temperature I Patrick linked a Johnny
guru review of the power supply Thank
You Patrick if anyone's curious about it
you can see that there someone get this
man a fan yes I know it is hot in here
I'm sorry it's like it was like a
hundred something heat index earlier so
okay last thing do you want to take like
a minute break before we do this one you
okay I'm a camera yeah is that yes I
want a break or yes I'm okay okay
reading some questions keep tapping
lightly on that radiator watch for air
through the tubes yeah I think I think
we're pretty good on that right now
pulsing radiator and BIOS get away to
make their escape okay noted just pull
the hair up my dude yeah yeah yeah sake
span on your head yeah one of the things
we saw some behind-the-scenes stuff for
you I think I was with Andrea the guy on
the camera right now we were in we were
in the iBUYPOWER
facility it's a pretty cool warehouse
they do all the assembly and stuff in
there and you know it's like let me do
this better than last time okay
current project is to take this thing
apart it doesn't need to be reassembled
I'm just I have it for something I'm
working on
okay all this they're all crap because
they're here yeah so I buy power
facility pretty cool place
most of those are they do assembly
on-site CyberPower does as well but it
was really hot in there it's in
California and it's one of the couple of
guys there their solution was strap a
bunch of case fans together like 120
mils and plug them into a power supply
and then just point them at themselves
which certainly seems like it would work
all we're doing is dismantling a 1080i
you don't know the process here it's
also not difficult but it is a pin these
screws when you put them back in you
absolutely do not torque them beyond
like one click of being tight because
they'll snap and I've done it there ton
of like weird shapes and sizes screws
holding these and video reference cards
together they definitely not easy to get
into
but we fortunately don't have to take
the cooler part I just have to get the
cooler off
Hey
trying to keep an eye on chat while
doing this how far
had you overclocked the 1080i armor on
water
I don't remember I'd have to check
is this the Xeon I think I said yeah
I'll check the questions that moderator
sent me in a moment I'm not sure it
should basically it's a gaming X so it
will overclock swear it gaming X what
does you're more likely to run it well
you're definitely gonna run to a thermal
problem with it if you put on water
though which is what I think you said
you would do then you eliminate that so
you actually end up with you know one of
the worst coolers on the market for a
1080i air coolers but one of them well
not fast but certainly a very good PCB
for $700 so if you're willing to strip
that crabby cooler off of there and put
it under liquid it's actually a really
good build choice
but uh then I get a better screw for
that screwdriver
as far as overclocking is basically at
gaming X so wherever gaming X every
clocks that screwdriver ahead that's
what you're gonna find for the armor
and overclocking you're more likely to
run is a thermal problem so Pascal
responds really well to reductions in
temperature it responds well I mean
that's really the main thing I guess the
Pascal isn't it
akka next step is these things we're
gonna wrap this card shortly I think
checking the questions that were sent to
me what keyboard do you use for your
personal computer I'm currently using a
g.skill mechanical keyboard of some kind
I just kind of switch them out based on
what I'm playing with trying to test
maybe review Abigail Partridge you going
to do any reviews of any of the a m4
mini ITX boards that's probably what
I'll end up building a gaming pc around
I don't have any lined up right now I'm
really interested in them but I do not
have any lined up today
nasal eye what keyboardd has got that
one and one Moll do you think thread
ripper will have similar gaming
performance as r7 1700 1800 for a
workstation build that can handle games
as well I am not even going to begin to
speculate just wait for the reviews I
get the yeah you know just I'm I'm not
gonna bother speculating because it'll
be based on nothing and and kind of be
pointless and not gonna get any value
out of me that you couldn't kind of
speculate on your own couple more screws
by which I mean like a dozen thank you
for the design Nvidia okay there we go
what size is this this is a formal
formal hex driver and remember that tear
down where one of these got stuck in the
screwdriver that was fun that that uh
screw is still in there
[Laughter]
okay yeah so we've got some cool test
coming up working on the EK stuff
clearly learning curve there but working
on it working on some feature tests that
I'm not going to expose what those are
right now but they don't involve new
products they involve existing products
I sent out some tweets that should give
you a idea of what those are Iko
twitter.com slash gamers Nexus I
actually tweeted out a poll for 144 it's
gaming anyone who does that
you're welcome to answer that poll and
help us decide how we're testing some
stuff but I'm not going to talk about
exactly what the test is what else we
have
everyone knows thread Ripper and rx bag
are coming out that is not a secret so
keep an eye on those I've been working
on a lot of power testing we just got
that clamp in that current clamp so
really a lot of fun with the video cards
testing for power leakage stuff like
that I really need to test all of the
CPUs again for their power consumption
so we can build a proper power
consumption chart for the reviews and
get back into more thermals versus power
test launchbox whose reference cooler is
better at the moment and videos are and
the F e let's talk let's pick a cooler
let's pick the Titan XP we tested that
it depends on what you mean by better
and I would have to look at my own
results to really give you an answer
the final page in the the Vega efi
review has a lot of thermal and noise
tests so i knew those were the least
likely to change from drivers or
something I can't see what I'm doing if
I'm show on the camera so you might want
to check that thermally and video did
better in one of the tests it did better
over time from memory and spec view perf
and AMD ba'd did better than some of the
other stuff depending on what kind of
load you were putting it through either
one though well once you noise normalize
I like
forty DBA they both suck and they're
both awful he put them 250 they do a bit
better I think I want to say AMD's did
better under Auto settings when they
were noise normalized but it wasn't like
wasn't an achievement to be proud of it
just that was the objective truth it
still just wasn't good though at 40 PA
and the Vega cooler as we talked about
in the undervolt in vain you can get it
to cool you can get it to sustain 1600
megahertz but you have to do the ladder
you have to offset the power 50% and
then ideally you under volt so that
you're not drawing so many watts you can
draw like a T fewer watts by under
vaulting it and offsetting the powers
they end up 15 watts more than stock
with a sustained 1600 megahertz clock
rather than what it does normally which
is bounce between DPM states six and
seven five six and seven fourteen forty
fifteen twenty eight and a 1600
megahertz from memory you can fix that
with power offset and then you have a
power consumption problem you fix that
with a voltage offset you fix your
thermal problem by getting a different
cooler or by setting it to a manual
curve because the auto curve is pretty
aggressive what do I have to do again
take this off I think that's what I'm
doing
current project is just taking a cooler
off and that's it we're basically done
right now alright nothing new there
1080i reference cooler okay
catching up on chat for a second and
then we're gonna wrap it up in a moment
Stephen Coe grats on the second stream I
have to say nailed the production value
totally forgot it was a stream the
camera is a lovely touch thank you it's
a lot of fun I really do like doing it
that way
now obviously we have no good solution
for dealing with sweat in the middle of
a stream because it's 76 in here I think
it's that thermocouple reader I can
actually tell you right now
with great accuracy
okay someone do a conversion for me
26
what is it right here where I'm standing
air temp is like roughly 26 C 26.5 26
someone was what's 26 C you got a F I
can work and C I can work in half I
can't work i right between 78 Jesus okay
that's what temperature it is here is
axis does this driver that you're using
and the bits come with the kit which kid
is it specifically seems pretty
indispensable like I said I fix it as
not currently an advertiser
that does not mean that I won't say
their product is good though because it
is so this one is the pro tect toolkit I
think it's $70 they have a smaller kit
that's cheaper the PC essentials kit
which we advertise for them for a bit
that one I've used I much prefer this
one to that one
price difference is pretty big though we
also have a 128-bit kit so it's like 128
bits not like coloured bit and that one
is expensive I think it's a hundred
bucks I like that one as well but it's
not as portable this is definitely my
favorite one I use he has so many hit
point eight yeah okay alright guys so I
think I'm pretty much done here at the
projects I'm gonna hang out for a minute
and see if I can get any questions that
I haven't gotten and I'll just keep an
eye on chat for a couple minutes here
while we close out the stream so please
post up and chat I'll try and keep an
eye on it the moderators will send me
stuff but yeah 1080i right here nothing
there nothing special I just needed to
remove it and then there's a PCB so cool
stuff cool stuff that you've likely seen
okay I'll just hit the keyboard
all right thank you
Strether bye link to the kit and chat
for anyone who cares we used to have a
code I don't I don't think it's still
active you certainly welcome to try it
gamers Nexus it used to do a $5 off then
certainly welcome to try it I don't
think it works anymore though I think
they expire those after the ad campaigns
over I'm glad I watched this rather than
the LAN show thank you
how strong are the bits and the toolkits
I don't have a numerical measurement I
can give you I haven't damaged any
haven't broken any on PC components
maybe if you worked on something a bit
more aggressive or stronger metal than a
PC component but this this these metals
are harder than most the components
you'll be working with yes
stresses reminder support the channel
drop a super chat contribute on patreon
you go to patreon.com/scishow cameras
next it stops out directly that will
give you access to the discord where I
hang out most the day so if I don't
catch your question today here ping me
on discord I'll get it there just doing
that Steve and I'll see it when I sort
through those at the end of the day get
a shirt gamers Nexus tout
squarespace.com yes these are brand-new
so as I said at the beginning of the
stream does not come with cat hair cat
must be purchased separately but this is
a new design it is an explosion layout
that we Andrew actually made in blender
so it's a 3d model and we turn it into a
shirt and it's got like MOSFETs and
phases and I haven't had builds I'd
analyze it but uh I mean I probably
wouldn't take it to like a PCB printer
and try to have one made but it's so
cool it's got a PCIe slots and stuff all
right let me get for the questions now
questions so the code is not active I'm
told probably fix it sorry about that we
might run another ad with them stay
tuned can you make about the Intel Core
i three five seven generation first to
8th gen IE
and also do not sure I understand the
question
could you livestream putting the
waterblock on that and putting it into
the loop oh for video cards we'd
probably do that I'm not doing a
GP waterblock today but I do want to do
them I really want to test this thing
stand alone forest is just like a very
straightforward 240 rad versus 240 rad
open and close type of thing based on
your findings with Vega frontier edition
do you think that even more even if the
RX Vega cards I have the same
performance as a 1080 the noise that
will be higher with a IV cards aib its
once you start adding a IV partner
cooler so these things they're really
all pretty close to the same now depends
on what I'm what you do is I could be
trying to normalize 440 DBA
trying to think there's one that's done
it poorly yet there's certainly coolers
that do it better they use one did it
better than its competition the Twin
Frozr did it pretty well I think the
armor that annoys normalized test poorly
but generally speaking once you're in a
IV partner territory they are pretty
comparable now rx Vega presumably would
be a bit higher power consumption than
the 1080i I think it's pretty fair to
say we know that we just don't know
exactly how much so it will run warmer
because it's it's pulling more watts
through the GPU core but we really need
to wait and see how much that matters
will there be a female cut version of
the new shirt and gray we can look into
that I have some some female shirts on
the site with a GN graph logo but they
are not the the v-cut they're just like
a female shirt so I think it's just like
a size down basically more or less from
men's shirts but we can look into that
if there's an if there's more demand I
have to do these print runs in like 24
units plus so check out mental Omega Red
Alert to mod for some great nostalgic
font that sounds good at least look up
videos of it do you plan on selling the
NZXT puck cameras Nexus sure this one
it's got a hair hanging off of it not
right now
I'll talk to them about it I don't know
probably not see a couple more Q&amp;amp;A is
before we head out
how important is it to para rise in CPU
with an Andy card and how important is
it to have 8 gigabytes for 6 gigabytes
first part of the question it does not
really well ok it's people are gonna
yell at me if I say that exactly the way
I was going to generally speaking it
doesn't matter what video card II pair
with the CPU I know there were some
findings early on with Rison with was a
DirectX 12 specifically or something I
know there were some findings but
dependent like what CPU you're looking
at you just kind of buy the car that
fits in the price class and does what
you want
there's no generally speaking no better
together then unless they go back to
dual graphics or something like that you
just you kind of pick the parts that saw
like Nvidia is not going to work on AMD
in fact and videos promoting AMD CPUs on
their website in the new build boxes
because the more thread over stuff that
moves the more 1080i is they'll move or
the more Titan XPS they'll move because
it's a high on part quantify and CPU so
they do actually uh they do actually not
really compete with rising in that way
are you going to send on Dixie something
back maybe well are there any any other
questions I need to hit today I used her
buy new that's an interesting one this
feeds into one thing I that I was
talking about earlier so Xeon versus i7
that's in the title is the Unversed i7
came out because again we're looking at
the render machine with 4k taking an
hour to render stuff and if it's gonna
take an hour to render a video that's
15-20 minutes long we need a new
solution GPU acceleration helps a lot
but it's acceleration it's not GPU
rendering and as we found out in the
video that's yet to go live the
multi-gpu setup we tried doesn't
actually do anything for us so we need
to move the 1080i into the top slot take
the titan x time down a notch for
blender but 1080i for adobe and then
you're left with the real choke point
which is the cpu the 48 960 X that would
it's called 4960 X we have overclocked
to four point four point something
gigahertz four point six I don't know we
have it over to Klaus that's the
bottleneck we don't have enough thread I
considering using a Zeon part from the
same generation x79 because I'd like to
use that and and not have to reinstall
the OS and not have to get a new
motherboard and that would give us four
more threads at a much lower clock rate
I think they go up to 3.8 3.7 so the
four extra threads should matter a whole
lot more than the clock for Adobe
Premiere so this feeds into the question
that I started with which is old versus
new looking at the prices of those eons
from 2011 or 12 2012 the price of the
200 bucks the really good prices you
probably wouldn't want a game on
something that's frequency intensive but
for a workstation box that's a crazy
good price for something that was once
$2,000 and yes it is far outclassed by
modern hardware but depend on what
you're doing especially if you're gonna
build a dual Xeon box I don't know if a
dhobi actually works with those I have
to look into it but depending what
you're doing it's potentially a really
good solution for cheap and I haven't
really tested any of it but I don't know
it's new versus used I guess you're
looking at what component is it I
probably wouldn't buy like your CPUs are
kind of safe use memories should be
pretty safe memory doesn't even get
overclocked anymore today so it's not
gonna be damaged used SSDs I wouldn't
buy used hard drives I wouldn't buy use
liquid coolers I probably wouldn't
recommend because those the closed loop
coolers have a lifespan to and if they
owner put it through hell it's gonna
wear out a whole lot faster CPUs are
kind of fine though GP is I'm not sure
about I don't know what do you guys
think use GPUs yes or no right now
because the market should be great once
the mining thing continues to crash a
bit more stabilized or correct itself or
whatever GB market should look good
secondhand but do you want something
that was used the way those cards are
all right so I'll keep an eye out for
those questions but let's close this out
thank you for all of you who helped out
through Super chat directly that is a
huge support because I mean the streams
are new to us takes two people to do it
with the way we're doing right now
applause Patrick and the other room
looking at chat strata buddy thank you
for helping moderate but yeah super
chats big
the patreon sports big help we got a
bunch of yeses coming in use GPS people
say they would like to buy used GPUs so
very interesting I was curious about
what the the community thoughts were on
that so yeah these GPUs look like a
thing people do anyway yeah
thanks all for watching discord link on
your July second patreon post isn't
working for me I'm aware of that we
deactivated it if you link your patreon
account to your discord account it
should automatically let you join the
server if it doesn't work message me on
patreon or post a comment somewhere on
patreon and I'll PM you a time use link
that'll let you join so yeah thank you
all for watching we'll have the usual
edited scheduled uploads for you all
through next week we're traveling a bit
so bear with us but uh take it easy
subscribe for more I'll see you all next
