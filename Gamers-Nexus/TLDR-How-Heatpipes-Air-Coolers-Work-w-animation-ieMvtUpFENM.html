that is too long didn't read so you've
seen some of our long-form articles on
the website but this will be recapping
those very quickly so the first TL DR
episode we'll be talking about CPU
coolers and how they work we talk about
the materials comprising the copper cold
plate or aluminum cold plate thermal
conductivity heat pipe wicking vapor
chambers and the fins and how it all
actually works to conduct heat away from
your CPU cores let's start with a
bottom-up workflow of how a CPU cooler
works first off there's the CPU silicon
which generates all of the heat the heat
is conducted by the IHS or integrated
heat spreader and from that point the
IHS is communicating through a thermal
compound between the IHS and the copper
cold plates of your CPU cooler or
aluminum in some cases that thermal
compound is critical because it fills
microscopic imperfections in the service
of the IHS and the service of the cold
plate for the CPU cooler without this
compound the imperfections would be
filled with air which has a much lower
watts per meter Kelvin rating than
thermal compound in fact it's about 0.02
4 watts per meter Kelvin for air whereas
thermal compound is generally between 4
and 8 or so once the heat has been
transferred to the cold plate the next
key item is the heat pipes the heat
pipes make contact with the cold plate
and within the heat pipes is contained
and evaporator believe it or not the
heat pipes actually contain a liquid
it's effectively a coolant and that is a
composition of ammonium and ethanol or
sometimes distilled water the liquid is
heated up by the heat generated by the
CPU and that creates a phase change this
is critical to the process there's a ton
of energy loss in the form of heat in a
phase change and when that energy is
lost it's because the liquid is now
turning into a gas and so this gas
starts traveling up the heat pipes at
which point the heat pipes make contact
with the aluminum fins these have a
large surface area it's another key word
here and the service area spreads the
heat across the entire area of each
effective layer within the aluminum fins
the fins are then cooled by the cooling
fan which pushes the heat off of them
and out of the case so that the process
can continue ad infinitum at this point
in the process the gas makes it all the
way to the top of the heat pipe at which
point it is condensed and through
capillary action it trickles its way
back down to the bottom and repeats the
process once the gas condenses back into
a liquid the liquid trickles down the
sides of the heat pipe normally made
either centered groove or mesh we've
copper grooved wicks run cleanly down
the center of the tube and sintered
wicks have a more porous and foamy look
to them
weave looks like a basket weave design
and the high end air coolers will
generally use a composite heat pipe
instead which means it's a compound of
multiple different designs so they use a
copper powder which helps with thermal
transfer and also helps with these steam
movements so steam moves more quickly
through the heat pipes composite and
centered heat pipes cost more than
grooved pipes but theoretically offer
better performance and this feeds into
the next point which is that material
matters thermal conductivity or watts
per meter Kelvin dictates the efficacy
of cooler materials copper has a 401
watt per meter Kelvin thermal
conductivity at 25 Celsius aluminum is
205 watts per meter Kelvin and then
you've got your thermal compounds in
your air after that we've tested and
found that alloy and copper cold plates
have minimal impact on cooling
performance when using liquid coolers
but haven't yet tested it with air
coolers conductive heat transfer is
expressed through 40 A's of law which is
Q equals ka DT / s where a equals heat
transfer area K equals the materials
thermal conductivity s equals material
thickness and DT is the temperature
difference across the material or Delta
service area and roughness also matter
in this equation and larger CPUs like
the LGA 2011 chips need a larger surface
area cooler to contact all potential
hotspots on the IHS using a cooler built
for smaller CPUs like the silverstone AR
0 1 or hyper 212 will result in a poor
edge performance on larger CPUs surface
roughness should also be considered as
it is needed to be as close to perfectly
smooth as reasonably possible indirect
contact is the result of rougher
surfaces and that means a loss of full
potential afforded by the copper and
alloy materials which have the four
hundred or 200 watt per meter Kelvin
thermal conductivity measurements
instead we end up relying more on
thermal compound to bridge the gaps
which is significantly lower in its
quote unquote K rating than the metals
and then there are vapor chambers vapor
chambers help draw heat away from vrm
coolers by hanging down from a chamber
design similar to a heat pipe in some
ways but they are better deployed for
localized heat generation by high heat
large areas like the VRM and the vrm
coolers this helps spread heat more
evenly across the fins as well so it's
not just a BRM benefit and few devices
use of vapor chambers but the ones that
do the erratic
we should dissipate that heat better
across the service area and draw heat
away more effectively from other non CPU
components that neighbour the CPU so
that's everything you need to know about
the basics of CPU air coolers and how
they work we'll do another video on
liquid coolers and if you're interested
in learning more about this topic you
can hit the link the description below
from my 2012 article I wrote on the same
idea and it's got a bit more depth than
you'll get here so if you do want that
extra are part of the TLDR
you can find that on the website as
