touchy subject but we're going to
approach it as neutrally as possible the
idea we had going into this was looking
at the current GPU market and the lack
of stock and inventory most places or
spikes prices we wanted to know how did
the manufacturers feel about this we
know how a lot of you feel about it
because you've asked us why is the stock
low I want to buy cards my game TT build
but we didn't know how they felt how the
manufacturers feel with regard to their
bottom line is it better because they're
selling out of cards or is it worse
because of some other unseen side
effects like lessened impact on the
overall ecosystem a minor buying 10 GPUs
doesn't necessarily buy that companies
for example peripherals for gaming so we
asked a couple manufacturers about it
before getting into the video a few
things to note none of these people can
be named so it is all unfortunately
anonymous sources they are from GPU AIB
partners but we can't say who and which
is a reasonable request really and then
the other aspect of this we might have
b-roll of video cards in this video it's
just beer oh if a particular video card
is shown on screen it does not have any
affiliation with what I'm saying in the
verbal part of the video so just those
things aside let's dig into it and see
what the manufacturers have to say about
mining that positive or negative before
that this coverage is brought to you by
Z Cordy 21 enclosure from thermal take a
$70 case with 2 4 millimeters thick
tempered glass side panels mesh
ventilation in the front for
breathability a rarity in cases these
days and a power supply shroud with top
mounted SSD sled learn more at the link
in the description below overall there
were pretty diverse opinions from each
of the companies we spoke to about half
a dozen or so GPU vib partners and then
also some power supply vendors so we've
got thoughts from each sides of that
argument because of course power
supplies are pretty important for GPU
mining on an intense scale the first
company we spoke to seems more or less
positive about this so they noted record
high demand which I think we could all
agree with and record high profit
because of that so revenues up demand is
up they're ordering more
cards to try and fulfill the rising
demand but of course the big note that
they had there was that the scare from
2013 or 2014 when Bitcoin crashed
previously is that these companies will
be ordering more stock to try and keep
up with demand from both miners and
gamers to fulfill both and may end up
over ordering ending up with overstock
and more or less investing money and
product that won't sell because it's
obviously these cards have a lifespan a
shelf life Volta and Vega come out
eventually so you end up stuck with
inventory that just doesn't move so
that's the concern they're trying to
balance out how much they order the
insight from this company was that this
still company number one they thought
that there could be a long-term
investment option they're hesitant but
researching there is a series of mining
cards coming out from Nvidia that's kind
of known about at this point it will not
have IO so the companies generally all
of them that we spoke to actually are
hoping that that will pull miners away
from buying gamer cards because
obviously the the biggest outcry has
been from gamers you can't build the
system with a 10 sec we've done 74 85
80s something like that
other than this the last thing they
noted actually two last things they
noted one was the company number one
does not believe that this should create
more console gamers which is an argument
we'll get into in a second and it should
not deter too many inbound PC gamers
they think it's something that
eventually will steady out and those
people will remain potential customers
rather than just running to buy a
console for example and that's something
that they see is good overall because
right now if you want to build a system
you're pretty much forced to by 1080
class or higher hardware and then the
last note from company number one is
they felt like they got a little bit
burned by our mas in the past for the
2013-2014 crash where people bought into
mining just before the crash like 1 2 3
months before the crash got some mining
in ended up doing either a full return
if it was within window and so you end
up with a bunch of inbound stock that is
an excursion from the norm in terms of
yours
for a return and then they also had an
increase in our mas where people are
trying to get a card replaced with
something that can be sold secondhand as
new
for instance so that's company number
one company number two in the short term
it company number two believes that this
is great for company revenue they are
concerned that or I should say
disappointed was the the word you used
disappointed that they cannot fill
demand for gamers specifically and feel
that they are a gamer targeted company
first so losing out on delivering for
fans is disappointing particularly
because they're worried about reduced
ecosystem sales we'll use that phrase
for other products that are adjacent to
their video cards so that might include
something like just pulling some random
examples cases peripherals not power
supplies because those are affected by
mining but cases peripherals and
generally things that are not involved
with mining directly those sales we
reduced an example would be if you sell
NVIDIA hardware let's start with them if
you sell Nvidia or AMD hardware and a
minor purchases your Nvidia or AMD
graphics card that minor is not also
going to purchase most likely a g-sync
or a precinct display so your market
share in those particular regions g-sync
and precinct for NVIDIA doesn't grow and
then as the manufacturer who creates the
monitor you don't get that sale so
whereas a gamer would potentially going
buy one of those two displays with their
new computer so you lose out on
ecosystem sales which is potentially
damaging on the long term for those
connected product lines that aren't
directly GPUs or power supplies the next
thing that company number two noted was
a increased sales in general right now
they're trying to come up with other
ways to keep miners off of gamer cards
though and help fulfill the gaming
demand they are also concerned about a
flooded used market that could hurt
bottom line later so the sales are way
up right now but later on that may come
back and bite the companies because
they're going to have a whole bunch of
used sales on eBay to compete with for
example and then a couple
notes here from company number two it
doesn't help PC game and grow because
you can't find an affordable graphics
card which pushes people towards
consoles so this is a a different
viewpoint from company number one where
they didn't think that would be a
problem and that the potential buyers
would either wait or would buy
higher-end hardware this particular
second company thinks the opposite that
it might push people out of PC gaming
and ultimately hurt the PC gaming space
if this goes on for long enough and by
that I mean the mining Cray is currently
happening and then the next point was
RMA so true this company says too early
to say if it's going to be better or
worse or the RMA process and then we've
got two more main ones to go through
here and also I will say the companies
we've spoken to which sell power
supplies are not necessarily GP makers
but just power supply makers in general
as a whole the ones we've spoken with
have noted increased sales kilowatt
power supplies as you would expect so
1,000 plus with the biggest focus being
on something like 1200 1300 watt things
like that and previously in 2013 2014
there was a spike in up to 1600 watt
power supplies whereas now it's still
it's still pretty high so kilowatt power
supplies are going for more and sales
are getting more orders and then the
higher eighty plus rated units are also
more popular because the serious minors
the non homebrew miners care more about
that efficiency according to these
companies so company number three GP
makers or a heavy partner they say
best-case scenario this is a short-lived
fad and then hopefully people move on
and gamers can go back to purchasing the
products at normal prices and the best
case is because it's a short-term fad
they would get increased revenue
immediately but not have long term
effects where people might move away
from PC gaming or towards other brands
worst case scenario end users are turned
off and move on to other products like
consoles and then this company also made
a very good point noted that miners
unlike gamers don't really develop brand
loyalty or any kind of affiliation they
buy the car that fits the watts and the
hash rate that they need and then don't
really care too much about the vendor so
it all they need is a lot of cards in
stock that fit a particular bill for
power consumption and hash rate so that
means that you don't gain a customer for
life and this particular company number
three would rather have the long-term
lifelong customer who is buying GPUs
every couple years or every couple
cycles rather than someone who buys five
to ten today and really doesn't care
what happens to them might have used the
RNAi system something like that and
miners generally aren't loyal to the
companies that make the cards another
note this company also feels like they
could be hurt when there's a ton of
second-hand supply which could affect
pricing for retail cards or at least
sales rates of retail cards so that is
in line with what one of these other
companies has said and they also again
are unsure on the RMA process impact but
previously 2013 2014 the RMA process was
abused a bit when the mining market
crash so that seems to be a consistent
concern with these folks where they're
worried that when this current mining
trying to find the most neutral correct
word is when this current mining
excitement may or may not fade if it
fades the companies are concerned that
the spike in RMA s that people can
refresh a card that's been in use for a
few months and then flip it on
second-hand market that seems like a
pretty common concern finally the last
company is one two three four seventy
number four they say that also they
would rather have a customer for ten
years than for ten GPUs today so that's
consistent with the previous one this
company number four feels that they
don't necessarily profit from the miners
because they feel that the miners could
exploit RMA's or could just hurt
long-term adjacent product sales from
the rest of the ecosystem again things
like g-sync freesync displays keyboards
mice cases which none of those things
are used by mining and if you don't make
power supplies then you don't get the
benefit of high wattage powers by sales
separately power supplies undergo a lot
of
views from that so we're not really sure
and neither were most these companies
about how that could impact the army
process because just way too soon to
tell a lot of them can take a lot of
abuse but maybe not as much as they're
being hit with in some mining scenarios
this final company number four also
feels that service teams can get backed
up by the RMA request they feel that the
quote actual customers who are gaming or
workstation users feel left out we're
out of luck and that that's unfortunate
from a brand building perspective
another somewhat consistent team with
some of the companies or not all of them
and and then finally feels that it cost
the company potentially more money than
it makes in the long run even if
short-term profits and sales was good so
that's that sounds up the AIB partners
and then on the power supply side again
generally I've seen better 1000 watt
plus sales that's a good thing but the
concern again just like with video cards
is that you end up ordering a whole
bunch of really expensive to make 1200
1500 16 watt 1600 watt not 16 watt power
supplies the mining excitement fades and
then they're left with all these
expensive items to manufacture on the
shelf and they might not ever move or at
least not until the next spike in mining
interest or other high power consumption
interest particularly because multi-gpu
is fading now so Nvidia doesn't really
officially support 308 plus SLI
crossfire exception of Vega forthcoming
doesn't make a lot of sense outside of
two cards so that means that from a
gamer standpoint you don't really have
the 1200 watt plus failed because it's
just it's a really uncommon use case to
need that much power in an industry
where power consumption is as a general
rule going far down from what it used to
be so you end up left with all these
power supplies because not everyone
minds and miners are one of the few use
cases where it's a mass purchase
scenario where that high wattage
actually goes to use as opposed to the
one-off single users and the single
digit percentages for multi-gpu
configurations that are very heavy and
power consumption so I think that that
pretty much goes through it I'm not
going to share any of my own thoughts on
this right now I don't think it's
it's appropriate for the video topic
we're just focusing on what the
manufacturers think however I am curious
what you all think so this is always
opening a camera caniforms but leave
comments below please try to keep it
civil but the part I'm curious about is
I know a lot of you have tweeted or
commented in the past if you are a gamer
that you are unhappy about the lack of
availability of GPUs and we've also seen
some comments from folks who say well
they're the manufacturers have sold out
they should be happy and I'm making some
money on my card so I should be happy so
there's two very different camps here I
don't know that there's a lot of in
between them probably couple more
neutral people who don't have any
opinion at all but either way leave a
comment below let me know you think and
I don't know that will touch this topic
too much going forward mining in general
but I thought it was a somewhat unique
perspective to speak to the
manufacturers even if it's off record
unfortunately but I do understand why
even if it's off record it's a very
interesting perspective that we don't
normally get and I think it's certainly
more interesting than a content creators
perspective since we've got plenty of
those already so thank you for watching
as always you can go to

going up this week should be pretty
interesting we have more follow up Vega
coverage we have some more reviews even
with the looming holiday weekend so stay
tuned for that I'll see you all next
time
