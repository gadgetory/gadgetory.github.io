morning this is what the NX has become
Nintendo NX was the code name the
official product is called the switch
it's a new console it is a portable
console that can be docked for normal TV
use and we're talking about it here
today because it's interesting from a
few perspectives one of which is of
course hardware big news point for any
console the switch has a new Tegra
Pascal SOC we'll get into the details on
that in a moment first of all this
coverage is brought to you by antec and
their new cube mini ITX case designed by
razor which can support a full custom
loop liquid cooling solution the switch
is built in partnership with NVIDIA it's
using a new Pascal tegra chip so the
Tegra line is a more mobile and portable
line of GPUs or actually SOC s is the
more appropriate term and the Pascal one
we haven't seen a whole lot of yet it
started to appear in cars but certainly
is in the nintendo switch and that's
because nvidia themselves posted an
announcement saying we're using our
architecture that's in the world's best
GPUs in the switch which means pascal so
it is a pascal SOC system-on-chip this
chip will also be on ARM architecture
because that's what tigra runs on so
it's not an x86 architecture it is armed
and unless something major has changed
with pascal in the news headwear that
will probably remain the case as it was
with the maxwell versions of the tegra
chips other interesting news the Tegra
pascal SOC will have unified memory
which is not something that's possible
with the add-on cards with x86
architecture so that will be feasible I
don't know if Nintendo has enabled that
but it's certainly a possibility and
probably likely that they're using
unified memory that would be a good
thing in the trailer for the switch we
saw very clearly that the elder scrolls
skyrim is in there i'll talk about the
other games in a moment but skyrim is
the one i want to point out because that
is obviously pc games on other consoles
too but it is a pc game and the
interesting point here i suppose is that
nvidia already has opengl and vulcan
running on the Tegra k1 and the maxwell
Tegra so in theory because opengl and
Vulcan works on both
those it should be a bit easier to port
games from one device to the other
though you're still dealing with new AP
is so the API that's advertised for the
Nintendo switch is called n VN API and
video already has its own and vapi i'm
guessing the extra n probably means
nintendo so it probably just means an
nvidia entendo api so that's the
application programming interface used
for the nintendo switch as far as we
know right now not sure how Skyrim is
coded if it's through NBN or something
else but just points of interest there
from a software level as far as we're
aware right now the switch is probably
processing and rendering all of its
output on the device itself even when
you undock it and take it mobile and I'm
guessing that's the case because this is
shouldn't be something like a shield
where it's just rendering remotely and
then wirelessly transmitting to the
device there's a lot of reasons to
believe that one of them is that
Internet's just not that good worldwide
and the switch was shown and its
commercial used on a plane which
absolutely does not have enough up and
down internet speed to do any kind of
remote rendering and the latency would
be insane so it should all be processed
on device it's basically a tablet that's
got two controllers on rails so they
hook into it on Rails and then you can
pull them off and use them separately as
two controllers and they can even be
separated into one controller per person
so you have local multiplayer on it two
players and each person uses one half
basically of the controller set if the
game has simple enough functions like
mario kart where that could be done
alternatively those two controllers can
be docked into a single sort of base
station not to use a five-word but we'll
call it that and that just creates one
fixed controller more similar to what
you're used to for a local console
gaming experience in the living room I'm
not sure if that mount that base station
has any sort of battery pack or anything
like that in it but you can't hook them
into that and then as a third
alternative there is a more traditional
rounded controller that's shown in an
eSports scene in this trailer which is
worth pointing out because that Nintendo
has not had a good history of supporting
eSports and Vidya AMD until they all
pretty much get it they support eSports
pretty heavily in the PC space we all
know that so maybe Nintendo start
to feel a bit of pressure or
encouragement to do that this time
around but we'll see if it remains
anything outside of the the trailer that
we just saw so the three types of
controllers all have pretty much the
same input other than when you're using
the detachable ones stand alone as two
separate single controllers and that
includes two analog thumbsticks a d-pad
which is kind of faked on one of them X
Y a B button so you've got four buttons
on the top side a home button a mystery
button I'm not really sure what that one
does and then plus and minus buttons
which are probably for paging or volume
or whatever the controller's also
definitely have at least the normal left
and right buttons but i'm not sure if
there are bumpers on them yet and as far
as the games that were shown in the
trailer this morning we know for sure
that Skyrim HD is in there the Skyrim
remastered remake that's coming out very
soon for all platforms that it's
currently on including the switch which
will be next year March 2017 is its
release date so Skyrim probably a launch
title and other games on it we saw
splatoon to mario kart 9 a new 3d Mario
in there there's NBA 2k16 or something
2k sixteens a bit old I guess at the
time it launches so maybe to k-17 but an
NBA game and then breath of the wild
which is the zelda game that i've
previously stated i'm actually pretty
interested in so that's what we know
about right now in terms of the games
the software api is the envy napi the
soc is a Tegra pascal chip I don't have
a block diagram on it i don't have specs
on it detailed ones anyway we've asked
nvidia for more information they
basically said we can't tell you you
have to go to n2 nintendo because this
is their product so waiting on nintendo
to talk to us not sure that will happen
and maybe they won't like our use of
their trailer in this video because they
don't have a great YouTube presents
either but that's everything we know so
far I am planning to get one of these
and minimally tear it down if not do
more just because it is an interesting
device will try and take it apart
without destroying it but at the heart
of things it is a portable handheld
console that is kind of entering the
space of the 3ds can be docked into a
normal laptop docking station equivalent
that connects it to your
your TV or monitor whatever so you can
play it normally from living room
environment so that is everything as
always patron like the post a video for
more information to help us out directly
things like that subscribe comments
below I'll see you all next time
you
