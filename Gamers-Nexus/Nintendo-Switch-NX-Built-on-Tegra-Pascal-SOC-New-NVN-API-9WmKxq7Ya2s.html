morning this is what the NX has become
Nintendo NX was the codename the
official product is called the switch
it's a new console it is a portable
console that can be docked for a normal
TV use and we're talking about it here
today because it's interesting from a
few perspectives one of which is of
course Hardware big news point for any
console the switch has a new Tegra
Pascal SOC we'll get into the details on
that in a moment first of all this
coverage is brought to you by an tech
and their new cube mini ITX case
designed by Razer which can support a
full custom loop liquid cooling solution
the switch is built in partnership with
Nvidia it's using a new Pascal Tegra
chip so the Tegra line is a more mobile
and portable line of GPUs or actually
SOC s is the more appropriate term and
the Pascal one we haven't seen a whole
lot of yet it started to appear in cars
but certainly is in the Nintendo switch
and that's because Nvidia themselves
posted an announcement saying we're
using our architecture that's in the
world's best GPUs in the switch which
means Pascal so it is a Pascal SOC
system on chip this chip will also be on
ARM architecture because that's what
Tegra runs on so it's not an x86
architecture it is arm and unless
something major has changed with Pascal
in the news head where that will
probably remain the case as it was with
the Maxwell versions of the Tegra chips
other interesting news the Tegra Pascal
SOC will have a unified memory which is
not something that's possible with the
add-on cards with x86 architecture so
that will be feasible I don't know if
Nintendo has enabled that but it's
certainly a possibility and probably
likely that they're using unified memory
that would be a good thing in the
trailer for the switch we saw very
clearly that the Elder Scrolls Skyrim is
in there I'll talk about the other games
in a moment but Skyrim is the one I want
to point out because that is obviously a
PC games on other consoles too but it is
a PC game and the interesting point here
I suppose is that Nvidia already has
OpenGL and Vulcan running on the Tegra
k1 and the Maxwell Tegra so in theory
because OpenGL and Vulcan works on both
those it should be a bit easier to port
games from one device to the other
though you're still dealing with new
api's so the api that's advertised for
the Nintendo switch is called NBN API
and video already has its own and V API
I'm guessing the extra n probably means
Nintendo so it probably just means
Nvidia at Nintendo API so that's the
application programming interface used
for the Nintendo switch as far as we
know right now
not sure how Skyrim is coded if it's
through NBN or something else but just
points of interest there from a software
level as far as we're aware right now
the switch is probably processing and
rendering all of its output on the
device itself even when you undock it
and take it mobile and I'm guessing
that's the case because this is
shouldn't be something like a shield
where it's just rendering remotely and
then wirelessly transmitting to the
device there's a lot of reasons to
believe that one of them is that
Internet's just not that good worldwide
and the switch was shown and it's
commercially used on a plane which
absolutely does not have enough up and
down internet speed to do any kind of
remote rendering and the latency would
be insane so it should all be processed
on device it's basically a tablet that's
got two controllers on Rails so they
hook into it on Rails and then you can
pull them off and use them separately as
two controllers and they can even be
separated into one controller per person
so you have local multiplayer on it two
players and each person uses one half
basically of the controller set if the
game has simple enough functions like
Mario Kart where that could be done
alternatively those two controllers can
be docked into a single sort of base
station not to use a five-word but we'll
call it that and that just creates one
fixed controller more similar to what
you're used to for a local console
gaming experience in the living room I'm
not sure if that mount that base station
has any sort of battery pack or anything
like that in it but you can't hook them
into that and then as a third
alternative there is a more traditional
rounded controller that's shown in an
eSports scene in this trailer which is
worth pointing out because that Nintendo
has not had a good history of supporting
eSports and video AMD Intel they all
pretty much get it they support eSports
pretty heavily in the PC space we all
know that so maybe Nintendo start
to feel a bit of pressure or
encouragement to do that this time
around but we'll see if it remains
anything outside of the the trailer that
we just saw so the three types of
controllers all have pretty much the
same input other than when you're using
the detachable ones stand alone as two
separate single controllers and that
includes it to analog thumb sticks a
d-pad which is kind of faked on one of
them X Y a B button so you've got four
buttons on the top side a home button a
mystery button I'm not really sure what
that one does and then plus and minus
buttons which are probably for paging or
volume or whatever the controllers also
definitely have at least the normal left
and right buttons but I'm not sure if
there are bumpers on them yet and as far
as the games that were shown in the
trailer this morning we know for sure
that Skyrim HD is in there the skyrim
remastered remake that's coming out very
soon for all platforms that it's
currently on including the switch which
will be next year March 2017 is its
release date so Skyrim probably a launch
title and other games on it we saw
splatoon too Mario Kart 9 a new 3d Mario
in there there's NBA 2k16 or something
2k16 have been old I guess at the time
it launches so maybe 2k 17 but an NBA
game and then breath of the wild which
is the Zelda game that I've previously
stated I'm actually pretty interested in
so that's what we know about right now
in terms of the games the software API
is the nvn API the SRC is a Tegra Pascal
chip I don't have a block diagram on it
I don't have specs on it detailed ones
anyway
we've asked Nvidia for more information
they basically said we can't tell you
you have to go to n2 Nintendo because
this is their product so waiting on
Nintendo to talk to us not sure that'll
happen and maybe they won't like our use
of their trailer in this video because
they don't have a great YouTube presence
either but that's everything we know so
far I am planning to get one of these
and minimally tear it down if not do
more just because it is an interesting
device we'll try and take it apart
without destroying it but at the heart
of things it is a portable handheld
console that is kind of entering the
space of the 3ds can be docked into a
normal laptop docking station equivalent
that connects it to your
your TV or monitor whatever so you can
play it normally from living room
environment so that is everything as
always patron Lee commercial video for
more information to help us that
directly things like that subscribe
comments below I'll see you all next
time
you
ah I gave you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
