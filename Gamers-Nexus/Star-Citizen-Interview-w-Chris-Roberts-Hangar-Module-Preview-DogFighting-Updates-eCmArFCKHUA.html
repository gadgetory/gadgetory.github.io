nexus dotnet and we are freshly back
from cloud imperium games Santa Monica
offices where we talked to chris Roberts
about star citizen and we talked to him
for quite a while so I have two parts of
the video up this is a shortened version
the longer version for fanatics can be
found below it's quite long and
basically we just went through all these
community questions that have been
piling up that people wanted us to pass
alonza chris and his team so that's
what's answered in this video i will let
you enjoy it if you have any further
questions please post them below and i
will see you all next time I mean you
should always think of the of the ship
itself being almost like a case in the
PC world and you decide you know what
brains you're putting in it what GPU
you're putting in what cpu you know I
mean all those things are basically what
you can customize that's one of the
reasons why I think that you know the
game can be pretty interesting because
you know you could have the same players
with the same chip and they could have
they could have basically kitted out
their with totally different builds
so part of I think combat when you're
going up against people were kind of
known how they set up yo they set up
that they set up a shipping office for
stealth and if so you need to change out
your package for that because like if
you have really stealthy ship it's hard
to get radar locks for your weapons and
all the rest of stuff so maybe you need
to have more scanners you know they and
but more scanners will mean that you
can't have as many other you know
whatever weapon or as much power so so
so we basically implemented that system
you know the balancing of its going to
be a challenge but it's really cool and
all those and the other thing that's
really cool is each one of those systems
has a physical component that gets put
in the ship so like if you're shooting a
ship for instance it's like it would be
on a real ship it's not like we just
roll a dice in which which which system
gets hit it's literally our bolt go
through like if we knock the shields
down and we're going through the hull
we've not the armor down now where our
projector whether it's a physical
projectile an energy ball we trace that
through the actual ship and does it hit
that does it hit the life-support does
it hit the power plant does it hit this
and if it does it'll do damage to it and
it does damage to it because of the
power system how they connect it will
affect all they all the systems in it so
it's all very emergent behavior it's
like it's it's it's
basically much more simulated than it
shoulda ditional e because in a game
most of this stuff is just like okay
you've gone through the armor and now
you've got a twenty percent chance that
you're going to hit their power plan and
a thirty percent chance you'll hit this
and you've done it critical here well
that's not the way this works this is
like literally if you're shooting in the
right place where you know whether the
power plant is or where the life support
will be then then and you get through
the army you'll hit it and you'll do
damage to it and if you do damage to it
it goes down that's actually a good
suggestion I don't think we were
thinking about underclocking but I don't
think there will be any reason why you
shouldn't underclock it to reduce your
your-your-your heat signature I mean
basically the process that we do is all
the items get created and it's just like
a chip where basically they'll have a
potential that can go over what their
you know the default is and we just will
when we create the item we roll a number
you know maybe its twenty percent maybe
it's thirty percent and then you as
someone that takes that item if you go
beyond the recommended setting you're
just risking destroying the item but you
know sometimes maybe you have to destroy
a couple items and you now get that rare
item that can go plus thirty percent
thing may generate more heat but you may
have a bill that you've set up where you
know you'll just do a little more damage
for each one of your ship so but I
definitely would see the obeah there'll
be sort of a market inside the game
where someone like actually goes and
collects these things over Cox and
builds bills and then sells them for you
know you know you know say twice as much
as the base ship would cost but then you
know you've got that a little bit of
edge yeah totally absolutely yeah you
know like you know with whoever the best
over caught you know the digital storm
whoever it would be origin pc you know
they they can get that extra yeah
they're there they'll definitely I think
they'll be like boutique ship people out
there the team's been really busy on the
hangar module which is sort of what I
was just sort of running around we're
going to launch it at Gamescon August
twenty-fourth when have a party on that
Saturday and then after that let people
download it and that
will allow players to in their hangar
they'll see the ships they've pledged
the very first rather of the hangar
module will only have the initial
pledgeship so that would be the aurora
300 I hornet freelancer constellation
but after that our plan is to
continually sort of all these modules
release you know the hangar module going
to a dogfighting module at the end of
December then the following year we'll
have a planetside module and then we'll
have a single-player alpha and then the
sort of alpha beta of the persistent
universe all these modules that we do
once we release one version they don't
they're not static we will like Rev them
every couple of months with a new drop
and be adding features adding content so
the whole idea is iterative development
with the community so they're sharing it
they're getting to participate in it so
I hope they all understand that at the
early stages i mean you know this like
when we do the hangar and we do the dog
fighting it won't be as polished as a
you know a beta is on an MMO that
they've worked on for three or four
years because this is a much earlier
process but i think ultimately it will
make a better game and a better
experience for people at the end because
by knocking out the problems early i
think it will be much smoother in the
end but at the beginning i'm sure
there's going to be lots of teasing
problem when the planetside module will
be sort of just expanding that out way
you'll be outside going to the space bar
or going to the ship dealer and it'll
basically be the first sort of public
prototype of what it will play like or
feel like down on the planet between
your space missions I think we promised
100 systems I think right now our map
has about 115 systems each system can
have multiple locations planets and each
planet some of the planets can have
multiple landing locations so something
like Earth has three landing locations
presently star citizen as it comes out
the first reve reve or whatever it's not
going to have a seamless like you fly
from atmosphere down onto a planet and
we like generate a whole procedural
planet because with the amount of star
systems and planets we have it's just us
a you know unless you're doing some
generic random looking planet which i'm
not a big
as that's like a Content issue just
creating that many assets so what's
going to happen is we're not going to
have any loading screens but you'll be
in orbit around a planet and then you'll
negotiate your landing at which location
you want to land at and I'll give you
clearance to land when you've negotiated
it you'll sort of basically here you
know autopilot the same as you would do
say in a wing commander or a privateer
and it would initiate the landing
sequence which will be an engine so
you'll sort of see you'll be like your
point of view and it'll just will sort
of take control you won't be able to fly
it down and you'll be point of view
going through the clouds externally
we'll see you you know ship going
through clouds and then the clouds will
break and you'll see the area landing
and you'll land and land on the pad and
then controls back to you in your you
can step out and go visit this the bar
or the shop or whatever so the whole
design is sort of an emergent system so
it sort of reacts to what's happening
and what the players are doing or who's
blockading whatever so the goal of the
game design is to have the players by
their own actions generate a lot of
what's happening in the universe and a
lot of the conflict and interest and
intrigue and then we as sort of the game
masters are adding and feeding new
content in on a weekly basis we'll be
adding new content in but the idea is
you know we can never add enough content
to keep up with how gamers are I mean
they'll just blow through everything
faster than you can great the idea is
the games themselves create eighty
ninety percent of the content that
they're consuming essentially because
it's all about you know their struggles
for power or which factions with what
are the faction and then we add in
additional sort of stories like so like
you know like a cool like five mission
series where you could get this one item
or we create a new sort of bad guy npc
or we have a new star system that we add
this one can discover and so we sort of
add these things in to sort of keep
things changing and evolving and we're
also looking at what the players are
doing and based on what the players are
doing we're sort of feeding that back
into what we're doing so it's like okay
well you know this one faction is
getting the upper hand in this area of
the galaxy so let's make some new
stories about it in our newscasts and
then maybe let's send some you know
let's let's switch something up so you
know this other faction
come over here and get involved in
what's happening over there so the idea
is to make people feel like this
universe is an ongoing living evolving
universe and not something that's static
the model of this should be more like
very small iterative updates which is
also what we're doing on the development
that's why we're dropping things like
the hangar module and dog fighting and
doing it or development of them so it's
just it's a different way of thinking
about it but that's that's kind of the
goal and with the animals from current
yeah yeah tell you what will we use that
I mean so and actually one of the
reasons why we're doing the public
facing deliverables is the you know one
problem to anyone that tells you about
agile scrum is that people like you kind
of kind of abuse it when it's an
internal thing whereas yes it's always
meant to be on like you're going towards
a goal and it's a demo you're gonna have
to do but you know when you're doing a
demo for 200,000 people you can't like
fake it right so actually forces you to
actually have it work properly and not
be kind of jerry-rigged in the
background so that's kind of one of the
reasons why we're doing it because I
sort of feel like it's it's going to
force us to get our homework done sooner
let me say that way because what happens
normally development is that you tend to
finish everything to like eighty percent
of the way and you're like alright
that's easy to do to fix up the last one
but you're off to the next task because
you're so busy and then what happens at
the end this why projects slip quite a
bit is at the end of it you just you
have a lot of things that you have to
clean up and not any one of them is
particularly like difficult or time
consuming but there's so much of it that
it just you don't have enough time to
get it all done and that's why everyone
crunches at the end of projects and I'm
not saying that our method is inherently
going to make us be brilliant and
everyone else dumb but I do think what
it's forcing us to do is instead of
having like one big crazy crunch at the
end it's sort of smaller Sprint's where
there's little crunches for it but
you're in better shape as you get
towards yet well no other than say thank
you I mean it's amazing i mean we're
getting to build you know we're getting
to build this game at a level that you
normally would only get to do if you're
doing it at a major publisher but with
complete sort of creative freedom
without having the marketing department
you know sitting over your shoulder
going oh you need to broaden out so we
get the casual player players in and do
this and this game sold well so let's do
that and we need you in this quarter so
we can really just concentrate on making
a great game in the only and and we have
no it we have no other goal than that
and as a game maker that's like amazing
it's you know it's like the artists
dream and that wouldn't happen without
the support of the community it's
something is happening that I think will
you know I'm not saying it's changing
everything but it definitely adds a new
element to the landscape of gaming where
you know gamers can have their voice
heard and make certain things happen
that maybe one have happened in a bigger
corporate situation and I think it's
really great i mean i think it's great
because it sort of it lets the voice of
the people or in this case the game is
be be heard more so that's fantastic and
and I you know thank everyone that's
really back just because you know it's
it's it's a privilege and honor to do
that and I'm thank you all for letting
us do this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
