as we posted in the 2500 carry visit
that higher frequency CPUs were
performing worse and that was a really
strange curiosity that we investigated
more heavily Patrick Layton is joining
me to talk about it he did most of
testing and at some times of writing for
things lately before getting to that
this coverage is brought to you by a
thermaltake and their core p3 enclosure
which is wall mountable and acts as an
ad hoc test bench you can learn more at
the link in the description below so the
issue we were talking about was with AI
v cpus i7 is no problem with i-5 the
6600 K at 7600 K the 0.1% low values or
the frame x we're really getting
hammered with GTA v it doesn't make a
whole lot of sense because those are
high-performing parts and in the other
games that we tested they really didn't
have issues so Patrick helped out a lot
with that and I we kind of I think have
an idea of where it's pinpointed at this
point yeah
so the issues are appearing generally
when we get above 160 fps appearing in
the games it seems like the i5
specifically on our standard benchmark
course when the frame rates are going up
to 170 180 range we get really hard
stuttering and GTA itself doesn't
recognize that stuttering but perhaps or
logging software does record some very
low 0.1% whoo yeah so the GTA FPS
monitor on the screen never dips when
there is actually a stutter but with our
looking through the frame times measured
in testing what we're seeing with the i5
CPUs is occasional frame times that jump
up to something like 180 milliseconds so
now you're waiting one tenth of a second
to get that next frame that's really
noticeable so we end up with an average
that's kind of okay if it's in a vacuum
but when we compare the average to even
lower end I threes and by fives that
don't stutter the i5 6600 Kane 7600 K
look like they perform worse on paper
than
CPUs with a lower frequency and that's
because they're lower than 160 FPS or
whatever the number is so the next step
that we took was to try and crank some
of those other eye size that we have up
to above 170 FPS in that range and we
did that with the i5 2500 K at 35 70 K
yeah and we noticed the same stuttering
issues once we were able to achieve the
higher framerate yeah yeah so the 35 70
K specifically basically that here's the
weird the the part where I got really
curious
let me over talked with 35 70 K the
performance got worse and so obviously
that shouldn't happen unless you're
really unstable but the overclock was
fine for everything else and so I played
around with XMP we well the very first
thing that was done was new GTA 5
install that didn't help then a new
Windows install which absolutely should
blow away any problems in the software
didn't help then we lower the XMP stuff
so disabled XMP down clocked memory and
my thinking here was that with the lower
memory frequency maybe it was an issue
where the memory controller on the CPU
wasn't able to keep up with the
frequency in this particular title and
that was really promising at first but
did not turn out to be the case yeah so
we also we try to keep a standard
benchmark rig together for these tests
for the i-5 2500 K revisit we have been
using a gtx 1089 govt of FTW for all the
tests and just for a sanity check we did
change that out for an RX 480 and we
were noticing exactly the same as three
issues yeah and that was done because of
the thinking there well one obviously
changes change it goes easy to change
but it's possible or at least originally
I thought it was possible that there
could be some kind of Nvidia memory
residency or something like that some
kind of memory contingency going on that
was causing the fish
but swapping the video cards didn't
improve anything so clearly wasn't an
issue with NVIDIA or Andy specifically
and and we even found out through
testing that as we're learning this one
60 FPS limit found out the easiest way
to replicate it is with the i5 CPU to
drop all the settings down to nothing
hello that's at 1080p and so you expect
your performance be great but it
actually worsens and if we ran the way
we validated it was run everything at 4k
which is now all the loads on the GPU
have 4k resolution as two times the
pixels or something like that and and
performance was perfectly fine the
average was half what it was but there
were there was no stuttering oh yeah we
tried a few other things too yeah a full
list of hardware that we tried out we
tried the msi n7z 170 and the slide
tomahawk v2 70 and if I gaming Pro
carbons be 270 and the AC 68 deluxe
board and we also just now have been
running tests with an O an AMD FX a
injury's MA and we weren't able to quite
achieve the frame rates that would be
causing this issue typically but we did
notice some slight stuttering it seemed
like when we disabled four of the cores
so we were working with 4 cores
overclocked and then lowered the
settings as far as possible including
resolution we were only getting around
160 FPS at that point but we think we
noticed an issue at one point so can't
really confirm that yeah I can't confirm
it I would have to spend more time
trying to overclock it and get the
frequency I put it under liquid tune the
voltage may be get the frequency to 5
gigahertz maybe an issue would pop out
for now we only hit 160 a few times so
it wasn't quite in the threshold to
trigger but with i7c Jesus hasn't been
an issue at all and those easily achieve
over 160 so we're basically looking at a
matter of hyper threading or even just
having extra threads in general eight
threads
this doesn't pop up but with four
threads with a higher frequency and
therefore a higher performance is an
issue I don't know why the performance
is perfectly fine and every other game
we passed and so at this point looked
into things like DPC testing so could it
be deferred procedure calls where the OS
is down prioritizing things that need
that are critical for game performance
and that wasn't the problem I ran a
latency mom to validate that no problem
at all that was inspired by tech reports
recent findings where they had to redo
some tests for the same reason memory
residency was tested that wasn't a
problem you did some Nvidia settings
tweaking I think yeah so online if you
just do a quick Google search for GTA 5
stuttering GTX 10 ATM it seems like some
other people are having similar issues
but the fix that normally comes up is
turning on vsync which isn't acceptable
for us so obviously because we're
benchmarking so some settings that we
did alter are the maximum pre-rendered
frames we said that's one mess with the
shader cache and threading optimization
settings didn't didn't help didn't have
any effects on the stuttering that we
were seeing right yeah the only reason
any of that would impact it anyway would
be if it's so far if it drags your
performance below the number that's
triggering the stutter so if you
increase the pre-rendered frames to two
or three or something then you're doing
a lot more processing per frame so your
frame rate will be lower that would fix
the issue fix to get a cut it would work
around the issue or prevent we'd never
hit the the point where it becomes a
problem so at this point to recap we've
done a new GTA install a new Windows
install we've tested
basically every i7 back to Sandy Bridge
every i-5 back to Sandy Bridge the FX
83-70 that couldn't do anything with
that different video cards four or five
now six different motherboards now
and a couple of other things DPC late
and see all that stuff can't figure it
out so we're kind of I think I'm at a
point where for the i-5 for gta5 when
doing the benchmarks I'll probably still
include them in the results but just
keep doing that disclaimer we did in the
2500 K refresh which is basically like
something's really weird here we don't
think it's us we've done due diligence
it still could be some kind of hardware
level thing but I don't know what it is
so I'd be really curious if anyone out
there has an i5 CPU that's probably Ivy
Bridge or later and even if you have to
overclock it but the easiest thing you
could do is go into GTA
drop your settings to normal maybe you
can do 1080p a much your GP bottleneck
and drop that to and see what happens if
you are going over 160 fps you don't
even need grabs it helps but you don't
need it if you just look at the screen
and see if it's not or I'd always have
and then into scenes it happens in the
pier yeah specifically on the pier in
the trailer park at the beginning is
that benchmark screen and the benchmark
that we personally use to publish is the
jet flying around when the jet turns for
the first time I think it is yeah the
framerate spikes and then we get
sputtering right so I'd be curious penny
one else has this problem we I sent out
a tweet Jay from jst science replied and
said he's seen some of these issues of
the 76 under K a couple of you have
replied and said you've seen issues so I
I don't know I'm inclined to say that
it's not windows and it's not the test
image there's a brand-new I'm also
inclined to say that it's not a
motherboard problem because we've tried
enough of them so I'm leaning towards
Rockstar GTA issue but I can't really
confirm that very confidently but we've
tested it every we've tested in a an
absurd amount of hardware yes I think
about the only hardware that's remained
constant is the cooler right went on for
the whole series of toasts yeah
everything else has been changed out and
reconfigured yeah and even the cooler
with the MD one was changed but yeah
other than that yeah so I think that's
really all there is to say I don't know
anything also interesting Lee ran into
with this um I don't think so but yeah
again if anybody else has run into this
issue we'd love to hear about it because
we couldn't really find a lot of user
complaints about this we don't know
whether that's because we're the only
people really hitting a serious CPU
bottleneck here right or what but if
anybody has this issue photos allowed in
our tweet at gamers Nexus thank you for
watching as always patreon link in the
post roll video if you want to help us
perform dozens of hours of tests that
have zero return
subscribe for more I'll see you all next
time
