talking about and videos to new video
cards that were announced officially as
of now and those are the gtx 950 and
1050 TI both of which have been rumored
for a little while but we've got finally
got full real specifications the sm
layout is the same as every other pascal
architecture card that is in the g4
series obviously excluding the GP 100
pascal chip and they're on GP 107 but
before we get into that this content is
brought to you by an tech and the new
cube mini ITX case built for HT pcs and
portable gaming rigs learn more at the
link below so this is a news
announcement that means we don't have
cards in hand and as far as I'm aware no
one has cards in hand we should be
getting them within days though if not
tomorrow
so today we're focusing entirely on
specs review will be this week check
back for that I'm not gonna be fluffing
this content at all so a hundred percent
specs here the GTX at 1050 TI first of
all has an MSRP of $140 placing it in
direct competition with some mid class
rx 460 cards it is due out on October
25th and the GTX 10 at 50 will follow
within a few weeks after two to three
weeks we're told the 1050 Ti uses a GPU
that operates on just 2g PC is the same
as the GTX 1066 gigabyte and three
gigabyte cards with three SMS / GPC on
the gtx time at 50 ti each SMA hosts the
usual 128 cuda cores per SM so nothing
new here at all and then that's us 768
total CUDA cores in terms of performance
scaling that mean the 1050 Ti operates
on approximately 40% fewer CUDA cores
than the GTX 1066 gigabyte model card
with the usual 8 TM use per SM the 1050
Ti ends up with 48 total texture map
units and 32 ROPS for reference to 1066
gigabyte card has a DTM use not quite
double and 48 ROPS which will mean the
difference between 1440p gameplay with
higher ultra settings on a 1060 and
something closer to 1080p on the 1050 Ti
which is what the card is targeted at
the stock clock of the gtx 750ti is
listed as at 12:00 at 90 megahertz base
with a boost up to 13 92 megahertz we
were told by Nvidia that
some of the AIB partner models may be
able to overclock upwards of 1900
megahertz for the total clock rate will
validate that independently once we've
got cars that should theoretically
actually be able to do that but with
that overclocking example we were told
these models use an additional power
header so on that front of power headers
the 1050 and the 1050 Ti both have a
total board power draw at least by the
spec we have from Nvidia of 75 watts
that's without any crazy overclocking
without any ancillary components on the
the PCBs or the boards or whatever the
board partners they may want to add so
we're looking at a 75 watt TDP that
means the coolers for the most part are
going to be single fan coolers not gonna
need more than that and it also means
that in theory you can run on a power
supply closer to 300 watts so that's
finally becoming more of a reality that
right now the 300 to 400 watt power
supply market is largely saturated with
garbage but that's hopefully going to
change as the higher-end manufacturers
do start entering the lower wattage
space because we're just you don't need
the high wattage power supplies anymore
like you used to so that's good news for
the market in general followers the rest
of the trends were looking at as for a
power supply connector to the video card
that's really only gonna happen for
cards that for whatever reason promised
themselves to be major overclockers or
for cards that I want to lighten the
load on the PCIe bus no reference model
will exist for the 1050 or 1050 TT I am
looking into memory we see a reduction
in data rate from a 1062 7 gigabits per
second and for comparison the 1066
gigabyte operates at a kibbutz per
second there are X 470 at 6.6 to 7
gigabits per second at the low-end and
the RS 460 also around 7 gigabits per
second so the 1050 TI's memory subsystem
has it operating on a 128-bit memory
interface and that's with 4 gigabytes of
gddr5 note also that the gtx 750ti and
1050 and all the specifications were
provided are on a 14 nanometer
fabrication process this is part of
Nvidia's already ongoing efforts of
basically switching their supply between
a 14 16 nanometer process based on
availability
between the fabrication options as for
the GTX 1050 that's a $110 MSRP card $30
cheaper than the TI and in direct
competition with MSRP for the rx 460
though we'll see where they both fall
obviously and that's with comparable
architecture to the 1050 Ti the GTX 950
non ti basically just kills one SM so
it's the same card with AP or TM used
128 fewer cuda cores and the same rob so
one less SM native clock rate is a bit
higher at 13 54 megahertz or 1455
boosted and memory operates again at 7
gigabits per second with gddr5 this time
the card is only available in a 2
gigabyte SKU and honestly for a card of
this performance more than 2 gigabytes
just doesn't make sense it wouldn't make
sense to have a GTX 950 4 gigabytes Q
anymore than it makes sense to have a 4
gigabyte rx 460 SKU and that's just
because you're gonna become Rob's bound
or limited somewhere else in the
pipeline before the memory becomes an
issue with these lower power cards and
by power I mean performance in this
instance so that's what we're looking at
for the 1050 10:59 Ti is also 75 watts
for the TDP and I will probably be on
someone cooling solutions I don't know
if any of them will try to venture into
passive territory but I suppose it's
possible because of the lower TDP it
just depends on how they clock their
cards and what kind of coolers thrown on
there mostly AIB partner models are
single fan coolers no extra power header
from what we've seen though they can
provide power through the PSU if desired
by the partner and other than that we've
got a couple coming in so we'll have
reviews for you shortly as always thank
