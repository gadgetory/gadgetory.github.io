Nexus dotnet and today we are looking at
geniuses GX gaming style software for
their new line of gaming peripherals
including the death taker Mouse which we
just reviewed I mean listen to that name
it is the genius death taker and that
review is online in the link in the
description below this I am currently
using the Gila mouse that is how that is
pronounced and for all intents and
purposes this is actually the same
software so if you are looking for
either Mouse this is what you get when
you install the drivers and here we see
all the different buttons there are four
main tabs on the top we have assigned
buttons which I am on manage macro where
I will show you how to create a macro
advanced settings and light options so
really not too different from that
Logitech software I showed you recently
except this one is a little bit a little
bit prettier looking I guess you could
say so let's go through and look at how
this all works I have one profile out of
6 already set for rift which is an
MMORPG and I have bound different
buttons to things I do in rift so here
we see I have rift alt bar 11 which is a
macro I've created
let's I'll show you how to create a
brand new set of macros so here we go to
profile 5 have done nothing with it this
is the default profile if we go to this
button I can click on DPI Y and I can
set different functions so we have basic
mouse functions LMB RMB MMB and Windows
4 and 5 we have office functions we have
play stop pause media functions volume
up and down which is these two and macro
DPI fire keys fire keys interesting you
can make it effectively left click 3 or
5 times or user-defined times so if
you're playing an FPS and want to do
like a burst fire button on your mouse
you can actually do that whether the FPS
will register or not some of it depends
on their anti-cheat software but you can
indeed program that to the mouse and
then basic profile switching let's start
with a macro I need to create one first
so let's go here and click on
you and we need to give this macro a
name we will call it the the rift combo
move or something like that so you see
here we have macro name these are all
the other ones I've created and we've
got rift combo move and then really just
hit record and record what you're doing
so I don't want to record delays between
button presses I want it to be as fast
as possible so I will hit record and
let's say I'm on I want to jump to hot
bar number 5 so for rift I do shift 5 to
jump there now let's say I want to hit
abilities 1 and then give it a 2 3 and
then we'll hit a finisher move with
shift Y and then after that I want to
jump back to hot bar number 1 and
continue my my killing spree there so we
can stop recording in a game like rift
you might have a buffer for how many
abilities you can fire simultaneously so
if that is an issue with your game you
can insert a delay let's say there's
like a cool-down or there's a channel
that's a good example say it save the
ability or spell channels for I don't
know half a second you can tell it you
can give this a delay a 500 millisecond
delay in between button presses so for
example in between 1 and 2 you can tell
it weight 500 milliseconds and then hit
2 and then you can keep doing that and
just basically program that delay to
whatever is necessary for your game so
that is pretty cool we have saved this
as rift combo move we can go to assign
buttons assign this as macro rift combo
move repeat once meaning execute once do
not fire it over and over and then ok
and now when I hit that button in the
top left it will do that combo or that
macro so that's how this part of the
software works you can save the profile
as a dot ini file and load that
elsewhere if you move the mouse so
that's the manage background assigned
buttons tabs let's look at advanced
settings these are
inherited from Windows properties so of
course you are familiar with the mouse
speed and basic sensitivity what that
actually represents and hence pointer
speed is Mouse acceleration and no one
wants that so we will turn that off
double click speed how quick the double
how click quickly you need to double
click in order to execute the actual
function and windows scroll speed how
many lines polling rate is interesting
it's just how frequently the the mouse
interrupts your CPU so the mouse
actually has a CPU in it as well and it
will pin the computer CPU X you know
it's a it's a report rate and frequency
so we could set it to a thousand Hertz
that's pretty phat pretty regularly now
I did experience issues with one killer
here where it would actually disconnect
the mouse from the system it would stop
detecting at first certain amount of
time and genius told me that was a
defect on their part so we have traded
samples with them and you can read more
about that in the review in the future
anyway you also have dpi staging these
are different buttons here where
basically on the mouse there is a big
button right between the scroll wheel
and some other buttons I know that's not
very descriptive but it is there it
actually I can show you on this assign
buttons page this button right here this
circle is the DPI button so you can see
my mouse speed changes as I'm clicking
it I know you can't see me clicking it
but it is going through different stages
of dpi that I have set and you can do
that here stage one basically you hit it
X number of times to get to one hit it
once to get it to two again to get it to
three again to get it four and so on you
drag this to change the actual dpi for
that stage so again pretty
straightforward you can enable X Y dpi
if you really want to and the beyond
that you have lift up distance for how
far the mouse will will interact with
the surface when it's lifted off of the
surface and then we have lighting
options which are again probably the
most straightforward out of all of this
you can set intensity and pulsation rate
and the colors so really there's not
much more to it than that this is where
the Gila the death taker does have
different lighting areas we can apply
all this with the apply button it will
do so this is the slowest part of the
software it's a lot slower than the way
Logitech handles their application of
changes but you know it works oh
whatever and there we go now I mouse is
8,000 dpi so I can't control it anywhere
and you get the idea that is the genius
GX gaming software hope this helped and
I will see you all next time
peace oh god I can't click on the stop
button because my mouse is too fast
there we go peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
