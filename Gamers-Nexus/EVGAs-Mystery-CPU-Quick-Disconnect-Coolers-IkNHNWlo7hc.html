EVGA suite here looking at some of their
sort of revived products companies we've
seen in the past I think this one at
least twice but it looks like it might
actually happen this time so this is the
qrg they also have a QR see they are
quick release or quick disconnect valves
and complete liquid cooling solutions
for GPS and CPU so it's basically semi
open loop is is how you would refer to
it so we're gonna look at those today
along with some just accessory items
like clamps and then there's a laptop
with an unnamed CPU in it before that
this video is brought to you by Leon Lee
and their 550 X and 330 cases the 550 X
is a $180 mid tower case with tempered
glass on all panels it's got three RGB
LED fans positioned in the front each of
which has a metal frame housing and an
open interior design if you prefer a
cheaper option the 330 is $100 and comes
without fans and as what we recommended
at most heavily in one of our recent
case reviews learn more at the link in
the description below so let's start
with the core components tough for the
qrg this is basically the hybrid pump
that we've seen in the past so this is I
believe this my the the CPU is a Gen 5 I
think this might be still a Gen 4.5 but
either way it's 2 palms so if you buy
one for the GPU and one for the CPU they
will each have their own pump which
means you won't have issues with the
liquid running too slowly for example
and some 420 millimeter radiators on the
market the pumps are kind of anemic and
it ends up with slow enough liquid
movement that they perform a bit worse
than other components especially when we
start daisy chaining things off of them
so EVGA is doing a qrg unit that you can
attach to the video card just like the
hybrids and then use quick disconnect
valves up here at the top which provided
by a s Detectives latch together with a
Q RC for the CPU so those two can
combine to form a semi-open loop the
radiator sizes will be 120 240 280 and
360 everything except 140 basically
and other than that I mean you can buy
it all separately and build the loop how
you want it is aluminum radiator
components so it should be a bit cheaper
than full copper for example as some of
the as most of the open loops do at this
point so that's something to keep an eye
on release is probably quarter two or
quarter three we don't yet have a price
on any of it
or a hard release date but that's what
it's looking like moving on to just kind
of a related component this is a small
quick thing these are just clamps for
the tubing so not a whole lot here other
than it just it basically stiffens up
the tubes so if you are having trouble
or well from an aesthetic standpoint if
you want it to look like it's hard line
tubing you can kind of fake it if that's
what you're into other than that I mean
it's basically to get the tubes as far
as I'm concerned off of back plates and
off of other tubes and things like that
that would impact the liquid temperature
which we've seen before when Jeebs rest
on back plates of GPUs if you have
multi-gpu systems so that's a small item
no price on that yet it'll come out with
the qrz qrg there's cable combs as well
really talked about that was pretty
obvious what they do as for the laptop
it's an SC 15 it's I don't have an exact
number but it's less than an inch thick
so it fits in the Nvidia max Q
specification and it's four core
components got a gtx 1070 unfortunately
EVGA would not tell us what the cpu is
but so it's an unknown cpu we do know
it's probably an Intel CPU given evey
J's relationship in previous laptops AMD
would have made a lot of noise about it
otherwise so other than that GTX 970 SC
15 bit then that less than an inch and
it's the next generation when that EVGA
is working on so a lot more information
on that in the future as embargoes and
things like that lift and they can tell
us what's in there officially so that's
it for this one you can subscribe for
more as always patreon.com slash gamers

for watching I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
