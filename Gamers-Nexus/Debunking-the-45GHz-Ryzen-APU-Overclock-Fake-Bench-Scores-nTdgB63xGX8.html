4.5 6 gigahertz rising overclock for the
2200 or 2400 G we bought those ap use
and I wanted to show you why that's not
actually a thing so we can all move
along and everyone understands where the
numbers are coming from this is a timer
bug that's been around since Rison came
out it was patched out for most of the
rise in CPUs at this point but some of
the ApS are exhibiting the bug again so
it's time to refresh everyone and I mean
on the screen right now it says we're at
43 50 megahertz or something like that
for the core speed I've configured this
to have a multiplier of 39 I've not
changed the bus speed which it should be
at 100 but it says 111 and somehow even
though I've told to go to 3900 megahertz
we're showing 40 300 megahertz so I will
demonstrate that this is the sleep bug
it will actually report higher scores
and everything but it's not really all
it's made out to be before that this
video is brought to you by Thermaltake
and the view 71 enclosure the view 71 is
a full tower case that's capable of
fitting 3 video cards and most
configurations it's also one of the
better cooling cases in our recent case
testing bench lineup the view 71 has
hinged a tempered glass doors on either
side that make it easy to open and show
off and it comes with at least one rain
fan though you can get the RGB version
if you prefer learn more at the link in
the description below so a this works is
really simple basically just before the
camera started rolling I put the system
to sleep with the windows s3 function
brought it back and we see a 300
megahertz increase in score and if I run
the benchmark here it will actually
score higher than it did previously so
we'll just let this finish for a second
okay so according to Windows that took
about a minute to finish and we got a
score of 643 CB marks don't take that
score too far this isn't like hey this
is what the score is because I haven't
even installed all the drivers and
everything all that matters is relative
scoring against itself right now so talk
about a minute in Windows that's not
real time that's the root cause of this
bug basically for every one minute in
Windows
minute and seven seconds is passing in
real life and this benchmark Cinebench
as with many others
I think blender is included in that
those tools that use a start versus end
time for scoring are scoring versus the
windows time that's reported and the
windows time that's reported is
incorrect because if you looked at the
base clock for example that was showing
111 megahertz a reality that's 100
megahertz so somewhere in here Windows
is reporting the incorrect time it's
actually reporting time slower than is
transpiring in real life and because the
benchmark is completing in the exact
same amount of time say about a minute
and seven seconds what's happening is it
thinks less time is passing because time
is passing more slowly in Windows but in
fact same amount of times passing
however it's giving us a higher score
and again I'll just bring this up so at
4300 megahertz
reported in cpu-z and now I'm gonna do
is just restart it restarting is
different in Windows 10 then shutting
down shutting down will give us a hybrid
shut down so we're gonna restart that'll
clear everything and boot back in okay
so we've rebooted completely cold
restart which is a thin now and if we
open up CPU Z there we go thirty nine
hundred megahertz now so now that we are
at 3900 megahertz
again if we ran that test again we would
get a lower score than what we just saw
a moment ago even though both tests were
actually at 3900 megahertz
the timing is different now it's
actually proper real-time way so this is
very convenient timing and we've ended
at 435 434 somewhere in there but either
way it's taken more Windows reported
time than the first one
so 566 for the CPU score this time again
don't compare that versus anything else
not the point
compare it only against the previous one
643 so it looks like there was an
improvement after putting the system to
sleep but it's not improved all that's
happening is you're cheating with the
timer bug and software that validates
time like 3dmark software would report
it as an invalid bench run software that
does not validate time Cinebench would
report it as perfectly valid and you've
just improved it by way of a fake
overclock that doesn't exist so I think
that pretty much covers it just to kind
of prove a point let's get the windows
clock up here alongside a cellphone
stopwatch and and demonstrate the timing
and then we should be done okay so three
two one go so what we're doing is timing
with the phone real time versus Windows
Windows doesn't have access to internet
or anything it's not updating actively
it's just taking a lawn as as the host
to dictate so right now this is pre
sleepbug you can see we're at 26 seconds
where I are well either way matter what
I say it's gonna be a bit ahead so yeah
they're tight that's all that really
matters
we're tied here I would go sleep and
wake it back up okay so clearly it went
to sleep because everything as still as
it was and let's do this one more time
just barely good so what should happen
is the phone should start pulling away
as time ticks on and we'll probably just
cut to that or something or speed this
up
so we've hit a minute here and we're at
54 seconds up there so let it keep going
3 2 1 stop so a minute six point six and
versus one minute so we're about six
point six seconds over in real time
versus what Windows is reporting that's
all there is to it it's very simple if
you think you got a four point five
gigahertz overclock I'm so sorry to ruin
your day you didn't perhaps on a future
rise in architecture but this is not an
architecture that is readily capable of
doing four point five six gigahertz on
an APU it's fully possible that rise and
could get there but right now the only
reason that numbers is appearing is
because of the timing bug and then the
score is aligned with it because they're
all based on time so it actually looks
like it validates like it looks
legitimate but it's not and if you're on
3d mark or some other I think hardware
Bob's x265 benchmark also validates
against time those would be what to use
or you just use a cell phone so yeah
that's it that's all for this one we
have a lot of really cool content coming
out for the 2200 G in the 2400 G that's
a bit different from most of the reviews
that you've seen thus far we have some
some fun feature ideas for it because we
did end up buying ours and getting them
on the same day as embargo left so
because of that we'll save the reviews
and just do cool stuff
one quick note on this it does depend on
the motherboard we were able to
reproduce this on MSI boards the Asus
crosshair six hero did not have this
problem so it seems to be patched out
there already and other boards your
mileage may vary so if you have the
issue just check for BIOS updates for
anything that's going to be getting that
update later it'll probably come after
Chinese New Year and subscribe to catch
