news recap for the last week of computer
hardware and some notes on the upcoming
Computex trade show which is the biggest
for our industry every year it is less
than less than well it's a couple weeks
away at this point and also recapping on
the stream but beyond that rumors on
risin because the new ones going up so
those are going to be nonstop for a
while Intel debuting seven nanometer
process at some points to try and combat
TSM sees five nanometer and then until
also expecting a rebound in CPU
shortages for a second half of 2019
before that this video is brought to you
by EB J's a new audio sound card
engineered by audio note EVGA a CEO
knows high quality audio and has begun
bringing sound cards back the new audio
sound card is capable of delivering
hair-raising audio superior to onboard
sound the card includes a line in
headphone line out and Mike in and a
Sony Philips digital interface new audio
also leverages the EVGA specv design
experience has upgradeable op amps and
uses AKM premium components for its DAC
and ADC learn more at the link in the
description below so for the quick GN
store news item the media mod mats have
actually been shipping out and the large
as well since we got them back in a lot
of you have bought the mediums thank you
for picking those up we have a decent
amount of stock on medium we're very low
on large at this point but they aren't
on stored on cameras access denied if
you're interested the livestream results
and Computex if you missed our about 8
hours of live streaming this past
weekend we overclocked a risin 720 700 X
with Joe Stefan Z aka bearded hardware
and overclocked a kingpin
EVGA 28 ET i card we have recaps on
those streams on the channel for more
detail but the very very short version
is that the Rison 7 2700 CPU we got up
to about 5.6 gigahertz nearly and scored
pretty high in Cinebench as well we were
approaching not quite there we were
approaching low and thread Ripper like
1950 X last gen results so we were
something like 500 points away from
thread repair and then for the kingpin
card the the 20 atti cane pin we ended
up at almost 2,600 megahertz and for
point of reference the base overclocks
on most 2082
we'll end at about 20 52 maybe 21 15 if
you're lucky
so 2600 is quite high that's that's why
we still have a lot of Ellen to because
we're using it for those streams so if
you do want to catch the short recaps
with more detail on what we did what
types of settings we applied you can
find those on the channel but that's the
short version if you wanted one so rumor
up first there's actually been a lot of
these last few days that's all about
rise and first the the note on rumors we
try not to pay too much attention to
rumors or leaks of specs because a lot
of the time they're wrong we try not to
speculate especially but if it looks
like it's credible we'll talk about it
one thing that is not really at this
point super crowd of although maybe
possible is a it seems like so people
are talking a lot about 5 gigahertz and
rise in 3000 and there's kind of its
nebulous what that means 5 gigahertz
doesn't maybe like super XFR on who
knows what future chip but realistically
you're probably almost certainly not
going to see 5 gigahertz all core so get
that out idea out of your head now 5
gigahertz all core stock out of the box
almost certainly not happening I just
wanted to address that one right away
because that one's that one's pretty
easy to tackle and a lot of people do
seem to be expecting that so expect
smaller gains than that but beyond that
we can talk about some of the other
things here so rumors and speculation
running rampant we know that there's
going to be 16 corner 12 core GN talked
about that after CES we were able to
confirm it at CES the release date for
those is to be determined there's going
to be an 8 core rise in 7 SKU that is
known fact and 12 and 16 core we know
with pretty high certainty for several
months now so those are happening but
that was a I guess leaked a bit again
and T um API sak on Twitter is the one
who has been claiming that there's a 16
core engineering sample out in the wild
and reporting a an alleged base clock of
3.3 gigahertz and an alleged abuse clock
of 4.2 gigahertz so this coincides with
a lot of what we've
heard we know there's 16 cores at some
point we've also heard well I'm not
gonna give the frequency numbers we've
heard because I don't know if they're
fully accurate but not 5 gigahertz we
have not heard that yet so it may be XFR
on like a lower end lower core count
chip or something maybe but anyway
that'll be on X 570 we have information
on those boards coming up at Computex
for sure the motherboard event
manufactures will almost certainly all
have X 5 somebody there will be
reporting on it to make sure you say
stay subscribed you get subscribe to see
our Computex coverage we will get there
like May 22nd or something and then the
show officially starts roughly the 27th
and after Andy's keynote is when you can
expect to see a lot of X 570 coverage as
for the rest well stay tuned I guess the
the biggest leak that we have right now
is potentially 2.3 gigahertz base 4.2
boost and to be determined on how many
cores that effects and that's for the 16
core it's also going to be a 12 core at
some point okay NVIDIA is apparently
going to stop dividing taurine into the
a and non-ace queues this is something
we reported on when dissecting the EVGA
r-tx 2070 XE ultra we compared the TU
106 400 - a 1 and the T 106 400 a - a
one dies and there was a pretty
significant difference between those the
separate Turing die is allowed and video
to cherry-pick the best of the best out
of the yields and offer them in the form
of a dies for partners flagship and
overclocked cards for an extra cost
meanwhile Nvidia could offer the lower
quality non aid thighs which Nvidia
forbade pre overclocking on for lower
priced cards down the stack users could
of course I overclocked these cards
themselves but AI be partners were not
allowed to pre overclock them and it's
highly unlikely that a non a die with
overclock as well as it's been a die
counterpart according to the Tom's
Hardware report at the end of May the
r-tx 2080 and 2070 cards will use only
one variant of Turing and that's going
to be the tu-104 410 no more a and there
in tu 106 410 respectively this implies
that TSM C is 12 nanometer FF n
processes that the GPS are built onto is
mature enough for optimum yield and in
video no longer needs to separate the
silicon out this is theoretically good
news as
new silicon should level the playing
field in terms of price relative to the
GPU users are buying it should also mean
that we can expect higher quality
taurine silicon in the future we'll see
if nvidia plans to do the same thing
with the 2080 TI and the TU 102 die in
intel news the company revealed that
it's 2019
major investor medium that it had was
like a 4-hour thing on the phone that it
will ship its first 10 nanometer CPUs in
volume finally i slake this june and
this also aligns with intel's plans to
have ice lake based devices on shelves
for a holiday of 2019 intel also
anticipates a steady cadence of 10
nanometer products throughout 2019 and
2020 and then 10 nanometer agile x fpga
is a 10 nanometer GPU at some point
tiger lake and 10 nanometers norwich SRC
aimed at 5g until will also be debuting
at 7 nanometer process in 2021 competing
with TSM C's 5 nanometer process and
Tom's first seven animated product will
be an Intel X Y or collector--base GPU
following its first discrete GPU in 2020
Intel 7 animated process will be the
first time they come into use is EUV or
extreme ultraviolet lithography and
Intel expects a two times improvement in
terms of density over 10 nanometer Intel
will also lean heavily into its EMI B
and FiOS technology as 7 nanometre Intel
finally also it plans to focus on intra
node optimizations so this would be more
plus steps we saw a lot of 49 or plus
plus plus plus plus plus plus plus and
despite getting kind of mocked to
intel's credit driving 14 nanometer as
far as it has is genuinely impressive
they got a lot out of that process and
it sounds like this will continue going
forward so rather than just being a
stopgap for 10 nanometer this will this
will go into perhaps a 10 nanometer plus
at some point in the future and it also
helps avoid taking too much risk with
new nodes going forward while also
improving the scaling between
generations and how much can be gotten
out of each step in the process so Intel
expects to deliver one Moore's Law game
at the beginning of a node and then one
at the final revision of a node am dnews
now the worlds at current fastest
supercomputers called
sumit and it is set to be dethroned in
2021 with a joint venture between AMD
and cray cray if you don't know was one
of the original one of the og high-end
or super computer manufacturers and we
actually have some coverage of them from
years ago when we visited the Mountain
View Computer History Museum in
California and we have that coverage on
the channel if you just search for a
computer history museum look for the one
with Jim Vincent joining me we show the
Cray supercomputers ants with the other
Cray computers at that time so frontier
is what the system's supposed to be
called it is expected to be delivered to
the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in
2021 and will be the world's first
exascale supercomputer targeting 1.5 x
of flops of compute performance this is
it roughly five times some its current
200 petaflop some performance and the
exact details haven't yet been confirmed
but frontier will be leveraging and
these epic CPUs Radeon Instinct GPUs and
Andy's infinity fabric and craze
slingshot technology it's an
interconnect each node will feature one
AMD FX CPU and then four Radeon Instinct
GPUs so the quote from Steve Scott
senior vice president and CTO at Cray is
as follows we are excited to work with
the team at and eats deliver the front
tier system to Oak Ridge National
Laboratory crazy Shasta supercomputers
are designed to support leading-edge
processor technologies and high
performance storage all tightly
interconnected by crazy new slingshot
Network the combination of cray and AMD
technology in the frontier system will
dramatically enhance performance at
scale for AI analytics and simulation
enabling do-e to further push the
boundaries of scientific discovery
frontier will be deployed to study
whether subatomic structures genomics
physics and more different times has
been reporting recently that's Intel and
its supply chain vendors for notebooks
are signaling Intel CB shortage will
ease in June of 2019 the first time
we've really heard anything of that sort
for about a year now
and this is as Intel expects to increase
its shipments of entry-level processors
so Intel has been aggressively focusing
on the higher margin products it's also
shifted some of its DIY processors to
sis or system integrators and
said the company has been focusing on
top customers as well during the CPU
drought and this change if they do
overcome the shortage will be
significant for pricing and for
availability digitized reports that
Intel has informed Notebook partners
that it will begin shipping entry-level
chips in June and while there will still
be some shortages the shortages will
greatly narrow notebook shipments are
expected to rebound in the second
quarter after a sluggish first quarter
primarily riding on the hype for Intel
and Nvidia's newest mobile chips install
CPU shortage has driven many vendors and
OEMs to put in orders with AMD however
according to digitized sources vendors
such as Dell HP and Lenovo are expected
to be putting in more orders with Intel
instead of AMD Intel CEO Bob Swan
recently acknowledged Intel CPU troubles
in an earnings call stating that the CP
shortage would not be fully rectified
until quarter three SWANA also vowed
quote never again to be a constraint in
Intel's customers growth last year Dell
EMC CTO John Rose didn't seem to be
overly impressed with Andy's epic
platform and we have a quote they're
saying AMD is doing some interesting
things and by adding them to the
portfolio we pick up a few extra areas
but let's be very clear there's a huge
dominant player in compute
semiconductors and then there is a
challenger which is doing some very good
innovative work called AMD but the gap
between them is quite large in terms of
market share and use cases so our
portfolio is not going to change in a
meaningful way and Roche said this in
the interview last year and then said
don't expect it to be a duopoly any time
soon now in a very contrasting statement
dolls at Dominique Van Ham states that
the company will essentially triple its
epic server offerings and support the
upcoming seven nanometer epic Rome
products and this is got a quote as well
that says out of let's say 50 or so
platforms that we have today three of
them are AMD and we'll probably triple
that by the end of this year going up to
nine in that instance so aside from the
promises that seven nanometer brains and
ham sights a high demand for epic from
customers particularly in
general-purpose markets still and these
representation in dolls server portfolio
will pale in comparison to Intel's again
nine out of
in that instance but it is growing and
challenges aside and these epic adoption
continue steadily as the company has
been picking its shots wisely with cloud
service providers we talked about that
last week with AWS
that's it for this one thank you for
