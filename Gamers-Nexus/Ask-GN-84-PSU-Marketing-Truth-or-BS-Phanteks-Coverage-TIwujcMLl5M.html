episode I think this is our last one
we're shooting here we're in Tokyo right
now we were in Taiwan previously and we
have a rapid-fire Computex ask Jia and
that'll go up shortly we also have a
patreon Bachrach Deanna's always on
patreon.com slash gamers next is if you
want access to that content before that
this video is brought to you by us and
the gamers Nexus anti-static mod map the
GaN anti-static mana is a four foot by
two foot surface 2 millimeters thick of
high-quality industrial grade
anti-static material and it includes a
common ground point for earth a
grounding wrist strap
and it has on its electrical wiring
diagrams that may prove useful a GPU
silhouette and grid for your teardown
efforts and other useful items go to
store documents Nexus dotnet to pick up
a GN mod mat today so for this week we
have a couple good questions one of them
the first one I'm about to read some
answers from builds IDE for because I
wanted to make sure I really got a good
answer on it referenced a minutes from
pretty good to hear ketchup is his name
who asks some power supply manufacturers
including EVGA have in their product
descriptions and advertising for helping
you achieve higher overclocks what do
you say that this is fundamentally true
so I did I spoke with builds right about
this I think to an extent it can be true
for sure it depends on kind of what
you're talking out for overclocking
though certainly a really cheap bad
power supplies growing impact just about
everything but once you get into decent
and above how much does it really matter
so osep limits are something to pay
attention to at the very top level if
you have for example multi rail without
a single rail toggle or function that
can be a limiter where we've run into
that in the past with some of our power
supplies where they're multi rail and
they don't allow single rail toggling
and you can't change our CP so it was
something like a 79 80 XC it's not hard
to trip OCP at like 50 amps or something
like that so that can be a limit but to
get to the more serious part of the
answer it kind of comes down to
potentially impacting how much voltage
you have to apply to the core or
whatever you're overclocking in order to
maintain a stable overclock which can
impact thermals and the current and
stuff like that so for builds ODEs
answer what he said was power supply
output ripple is relative to power
supply output power if you have a power
supply that has terrible ripple at full
power and you're
see polls the power supply rated max
output you're gonna have worse voltage
regulation on the output of the vrm you
know it's also on video cards have
current based power limits so if you run
Pascal on a power supply that slides
from twelve point three to eleven point
six volts
you will boost slightly lower than on a
twelve volt power supply or a twelve
point three to twelve volt power supply
and power being a he said to function
this overclocking for Pascal
specifically is a function that's
slightly limited by current depending on
what you're working with so and with
wattage being by the way a
multiplication and product of current
and voltage so bill toy continues and
says if a power supply has bad transient
response it will make the output of the
vrm worse and notice that with 79-80
axes on liquid nitrogen the main concern
is having the power supply not trip OCT
when you go from idle to full load the
vrm needs to quickly pull itself from
pushing say two point three volts 40
amps to two point three volts 400 amps
and that causes a massive current spike
further continues the vrm may well just
turn on all of the high side FETs at the
same time to try and maintain the output
voltage because vrm output voltage is
tied to current flow through the
inductors and at idle the inductors have
very little current flowing through them
they will drop voltage in order to
maintain the same level of current flow
again they're a function of the two when
we talk about power and in order to
increase the current flow through the
inductors you need to apply 12 volt on
the phase side of them and then if
during one PWM cycle you have 30
millivolts or more than on the next at
random for ripple it just makes the
output of the BRM that much noisier so
that's most of stuff to consider that's
from Build Zoid if you don't know who he
is good actually hardcore overclocking
on YouTube that's his channel he does
work for us as well here on gamers Nexus
x1 Jeff M says are you looking at
getting any fan text cases for testing
this year in my opinion the evolved X
seems to be a solid contender for the
best high-end case this year and I'd
love to see it put through its paces
with your thermal sizing answer this in
the rapid-fire copy text video where we
talked about fan tax and three questions
and to just recap it again fan tax was
unable to accommodate a meeting after
multiple attempts at Computex so we will
instead be purchasing the
the Senate's available to give it a look
through our testing as usual because I
didn't get to see it in person so well
look at it that's fine not everyone can
accommodate a meeting that trade shows
there they're very busy with a lot of
people and they have to meet more than
just media they're meeting all of their
channel partners and stuff like that as
well and no big deal I suppose that is
we got turned away several times so
whatever we'll we'll figure it out well
by one next question is from a Tallis
recreational nooks who has the best name
says why and power are some RAM gives
off optimized for Intel and some for AMD
how would this bidding process work it's
actually not a bidding process so much
as it is the motherboard support so with
x4 70 a lot of the updates were just
improvements to memory profiles over X
370 with chipset updates being
functionally zero and it comes down not
to bidding of the memory dies or the
quality of the ICS but rather to the the
validation of those chips those dies on
the different AMD boards and it just so
happens that samsung be thy works very
well with AMD in an easier fashion you
can get the other stuff to still work
it's just B dies more or less plug and
play as long as it's been validated on
the board so it comes down to memory is
very manual the vendors have to test it
and that's why we recommend especially
with rise and when you buy a motherboard
go to the supporter memory kit and make
sure or the list rather and make sure
that the kit you want is on that list
that they validated it it actually
matters it's not just plug and play sure
that'll work but if you really want
performance that's what you have to do
because there is testing involved and
they basically the vendors go through
and they manually tune all of those sub
timings that they can anyway so when you
plug the kid in it's not just picking
timings at random which is what will
happen if they're not manually tuned on
the board it'll just it'll keep retrying
failing to boot retry and that's called
memory training so the fewer timings
that are needed in need of manual tuning
by you the better and that's going to
come down to the motherboard vendors
more than the memory chip makers
although the memory chip makers work
with the vendors to make sure that it's
all on the up-and-up
next one is from GGC HB who says Steve
would overclock and be easy in space if
the PCB were outside the ship for spaces
negative 273 Celsius or would lack of
air prevent conduction of thermal energy
away from the core so this is a
really interesting question I saw some
comments talking about how cold space is
or isn't and whether or not it would
actually be negative 273 I don't know
what what temperature of different parts
of space are but let's just kind of
assume that you are actually at
basically absolute zero or very very
cold temperatures like you're suggesting
a couple of problems here one of them is
cold bugs so actually being too cold can
be a problem and with the scenario
you're talking about because there's no
air there's no air flow there is going
to be a problem where dissipation is not
really possible you're actually gonna do
better with radiation and heat than with
normal conduction and dissipation
because that's that's the most you can
do at a temperature like say that on a
three Kelvin or something like that or 5
Kelvin whatever it's basically sub 10 K
radiations what you're dealing with for
the most part rather than airflow
because there is none so that's going to
limit things but before that's a problem
because that would be a heat problem not
a cold problem because you can't get rid
of the heat fast enough before getting
rid of heat is a problem you have to
turn the system on and cold bugs are
free let's take Titan V for example the
Titan V has a lot of trouble below 10
degrees negative 10 that is Celsius for
doing much of anything
HBM 2 has a whole lot of problems with
negative temperatures Celsius where it
can just become unstable has cold bugs
doesn't boot we saw this with Katyn pens
Robo clock or where if 10 his his man on
the keyboard basically setting the
target temperature if he set the
temperature to low before the system
turned on it would just not boot and
that's problem that's a cold bug so
that's why they have things like socket
heaters on the back as well sometimes
the heaters are to prevent things like
condensation but other times it's
actually to prevent a cold bug where the
silicon just bugs out just stops working
below a certain temperature and so
that's that's probably a bigger problem
you won't be able to even turn the
system on but if you can then getting
rid of the heats going to be a big
challenge as well because there's no
just dissipation via air flow and
conduction it's gonna be relying on
radiation next question is from actually
the same person I think GGC hbu says is
there a good alternative to liquid metal
for deleting long term most people
recommend replacing alum every nine
months I'm too lazy is there a high
qualit
so speaking from personal experience now
we've had a high-end CPU running liquid
metal for several actually a year at
this point our slightly more than a year
and haven't had to replace it thrown
performance is more or less the same as
it has always been and that's conduct or
not
so speaking with thermal grizzly they
are a biased source keep that in mind
they have tested up to two years as far
as I'm aware and say that two years is
fine for conduct or not so I haven't
tested beyond the year or so that we've
done the system we're running for this
long-term endurance test but it's still
doing just fine so I don't think I think
with a quality liquid metal you don't
have to replace it quite as much as for
Tim's yeah I just you want something
that is not going to cure in the same
way that stuff like the stock case that
compound it's pretty good but it cures
and becomes hardened after a while and
that's a bad thing to put under the die
so it's something like cryo not where it
doesn't cure and there are other ones
gelid extreme stuff like that would be
fine to just if it's conductive be very
careful and make sure you mask any SMD
so you don't short them but anything
that doesn't cure quickly or at all
would be ideal and actually Intel stock
pastes if you want lazy is a good route
to it's just not particularly conductive
but it does last a long time so that's
the easiest thing to do of course if you
want to deal it though
get something that doesn't care too much
and has a high thermal conductivity next
one is from wormwood who says there's a
quick one any idea when an 80 86 K
review will hit the answer is probably
never because it's an 8700 K that's been
overclocked and it's priced too high and
it's kind of a dumb thing to buy so next
next question from silk monkey who says
with the trade shows combi ducks III etc
going on I was wondering what was the
best gimmick you saw at a booth at a
show and what was the weirdest the best
I'll say gimmick was probably dare
Bowers cooler and I the only reason I'd
even apply the word gimmick to it as
it's a functional thing it does cool the
product is his face change cooler so
it's not 3m Novik but it's another fluid
so it does actually cool the product
it's functional but it's not going to be
a standard solution you would put into
your system you typically go with the
CLC or an air cooler so we really like
what he's done with the phase shift
cooler it's just that
it's something that gets a lot of
attention and it'll be low product
volume very interesting product might be
good we haven't tested it but the end of
the day it's something that he's done to
get some some marketing buzz as like a
halo product and we've looked forward to
it we gave an award all that stuff but
yes I would ultimately say that it is
somewhat of a gimmick because is it
necessary no of course not you could use
propylene glycol and distilled water but
it's cool this he's only different
nonetheless the weirdest was probably a
she's a separate separating MITx case
because it was very odd implementation
it separates to allow airflow but
there's no ventilation on either side of
the separating joints so it actually
doesn't allow air flow but that's their
plan I guess after some revisions last
two inks says where did you or do you
learn about the business side of what
you do here on the channel marketing how
to sell ads best way to approach
companies and so on behind the scenes to
run the channel Chen the answer is doing
it for like 10 years basically on the
website side doing YouTube bit later and
kind of trying things until they worked
is really the answer that's the only way
to do it I think and being in front of
people at trade shows as much as
possible
next question el Pye says how do you
feel after heat torturing the poor HUD
Matt so it was I mean it was pretty cool
it was cool to see how well it held up
to things like soldering and the heat
gun for tube bending stuff like that
holds up super well because it's not a
soldering mat and as long as you're okay
with the a singe mark it was really
quite good with soldering so silicon
Matt would be the best if you want
something that's like really really
resistant to soldering irons at a high
temperature but we were very happy with
the results of our my Matt even though
it's not marketed as a soldering Matt
and it did very well with to bending
temperatures as well so as far as how I
feel about it I'd say it was justified
and we can still use it in our lab even
though it's it's a bit scarred at this
point so as always if you're interested
in one of those go to store tech here in
a second yet to pick up a mod Matt they
are on the way now so you can backorder
it make sure you get one otherwise
