hardware news recap for the past week of
course we had big AMD news from the a
and the press event already covered on
the channel but there's also some other
things do talk about like Microsoft
rediscovering the page file and you see
has a giant marketing phrase for the
Xbox AMD and x5 17y it costs what it
does the motherboards do appear to be
higher in price and we'll explain why
here and then also Nvidia super USB 4.0
arriving in 2020 and Comcast tuned

note the large mod mats are back up for
backorder on the store we put a hold on
ordering due to the tariffs we figured
it all out didn't have to raise the
prices and if you want to backorder the
next round at some store like a Miss
Texas net the medium ones like in front
of me are in stock already so you can go
to the store for that
why does amvx high so any cost much
we've gotten this question a lot over
the last well since Computex and there's
a few things to keep in mind here so
number one AMD is now starting to get
some of the higher end brands associated
with the motherboard manufacturers so
this is an instance where the price
isn't actually going up it's just that
AMD is getting some higher-end boards
now there are places where the price is
going up but when you see the $700
extreme or you see the $777 god-like
both prices we've already talked about
although originally we thought the
extreme would be 600 is actually it's
going to be higher than that probably
but when we saw those those boards
there's a lot of sticker shock
associated with that keep in mind that
the Intel platforms which have
historically been they've had more
development focus who
the years put it that way the Intel
platforms have had boards like this for
ages you look at some of the super
high-end ACS gigabyte motherboards MSI's
had a guide like over there for a little
bit so this is not new to motherboards
it's just that it's new to AMD Rison so
AMD's finally getting it's being taken a
bit more seriously by the motherboard
makers where they are willing to
associate their super high-end brands
whether or not it's worth that price
point it depends on what you're doing
with it but they're willing to associate
their high-end brands with AMD now and
that's part one it's as simple as there
are more expensive boards because
they're higher-end boards this time you
get things like true 14 phase vrm all of
which use 70 amp power stages for
example so that starts to add the price
next thing the chipset cost more our
understanding is that the chipset costs
about two times more than the previous
2x3 so near x4 70 chipset which was more
or less the same thing it was more it
was primarily a demarcation and the
differences in motherboard generations
more than an actual chipset difference
the difference between 370 and 470 was
better memory support because of the
motherboard BIOS not because of the
chipset but the chips that came with it
was part of the refresh so 370 and 470
basically the same thing it's just that
well it is the same thing it's just that
it costs about two times more to me it's
a 570 it's a higher power consuming chip
AMD is repurposing Rison IO dice Iligan
for that chip and is not using as media
to the extent they were previously where
it was externally designed so that's
part of it as well the chipset cost goes
up now a 2 times higher is it's still
not a super expensive part you're
talking like maybe in the 30 to $40
range 4 X 5 70 as opposed to half of
that 4 470 but that's still cost that
you'll pay for PCIe gen 4 rerouting
required for some of the motherboard
designs so the motherboard manufacturers
couldn't just take their previous
generation and then pop a new chipset in
it and sell it it did require some
additional trace work rerouting a lot of
them to redesign
erm while they were added so being
unable to repurpose an old design does
increase the cost because they're
spending Rd or engineering time on
designing the new ones that drives up
the cost PCIe gen for signal integrity
is a challenge to some of these boards
have and we don't know how necessary
this is because we don't we don't do
signal integrity parametric analysis or
anything like that but some of the
boards like the MSI godlike have moved
to a higher quality PCB material and
whether or not that's necessary again
we're not really in the position to
validate that's something that we'll
leave to be e x or someone like that but
that does have a cost associated with it
as well so if it's actually needed to
move to a higher quality PCB material
it's definitely need to reroutes all the
traces then Gen 4 does add to cost and
signal integrity becomes a challenge
that it contributes to the price we're
seeing for the boards that do cost more
than you would expect there are still
boards in the 140 ish to 190 range not
quite as many as we'd like to see yet
but not all the boards have had their
prices disclosed at this time other
boards are more expensive than the
previous X 470 counterparts but overall
a lot of the the sticker shock is coming
from the fact that higher-end boards are
finally associated with Rison
so that's part part one of this part two
of this comes from MSI's CEO charles
john who we reported on something he
said Tom's Hardware last week as well
but in further discussion with Tom's
Hardware
he stated quote lots of people ask me
what do you think about today's AMD I
say today's AMD is completely different
company compared to two three five years
ago they have a nice technology and they
are there to put the higher spec with
the reasonable pricing but right now
they say hey Charles let's push to
marketing to the higher end so let's
sell a higher pricing motherboards
higher spec of other words and let's see
what will happen in the market so I
don't think that AMD is the company that
wants to sell low-cost here in low cost
there and I guess given that MSI CEO is
never one to mince words it does it look
like
AMD has some potential hand and
wanting those higher-end boards and now
that the and these sales are doing so
well in DIY as we've seen upwards of 80%
month-to-month so the market share
change from Intel that AMD it looks like
he's starting to feel confident in the
product it has and wants the higher on
boards associated with it so anyway
everyone's looking for healthier margins
here with X 570 and with the new risin
3000 series CPUs there's one final quote
from AMD's dunwall agronsky who said the
following if someone's searching for a
platform and doesn't really need that
enthusiast class PCIe gen for storage or
you're not planning to buy a PCIe gen
for graphics card in the next six months
to a year it makes a lot of sense to
look at those that lowered to your
motherboards like the x4 70 or P 450
which will offer the same performance on
those rise and third gen processors as
the x5 70 will which is the kindest
reminder if you have x4 70 in theory you
should be able to just pop the new
processor into it once it gets a
firmware update to detect it and
gigabytes already pushed those out
others probably coming soon it's just
that you won't have PCI you Jun for it
but if you don't need that and almost
everybody watching this will not need it
then you can use x4 70 finally quick
note here so be 550 or whatever it's
going to be called we were told that CES
that this was to be expected in first
half of 2020 that was it that was in
January we were told that first half of
2020 it looks like that's remained more
or less true we saw a couple reports
today that time of filming that went up
and said first quarter of 2020 or first
half so that's remains true if you do
want the lower on boards those will be
coming out next year
USB 4.0 arriving in 2020 apparently the
USB group has decided that people need
to be increasingly confused by USB
naming and so 4.0 is coming out
including a difference in where the
space is positioned or if there is one
between USB and the number marking the
USB version an attack was able to catch
up with USB promoter group at Computex
2019 and that revealed to Ana tech that
the newest specification is on its way
to be delivered in late 2020
USB 4.0 currently exists in version 0.7
with the final revision expected this
summer the USB promoter group believes
USB 4.0 will be widely available in
products by end of 2020 USB 4.0 leans
heavily into Thunderbolt 3 technology
and while the new standard is expected
to offer 40 gigabits per second
bandwidth USB for is also allegedly
going to be more substantial than just
that supposedly us before will be
significant enough to warrant a new logo
and a new branding scheme again yes
before will also use a Type C interface
and be backwards compatible with USB
three-point 2 USB 2.0 and Thunderbolt 3
if you recall the USB if' announced a
confusing new USB 3.2 standard not so
long ago and hopefully any revised
branding will be simpler and we won't
end up with USB 4.0 gen negative 1 to
mark USB 3.0 or something like that
because that's kind of what happened
this time
Xbox project Scarlett Microsoft it's and
its marketing team have rediscovered
virtual memory and the page file and
they're really excited about it at e3
2019 bikes house finally disclosed a few
key details on its upcoming consoles we
already knew that Zen 2 would be used we
knew that navi parts would be used this
is true for the Sony Playstation as well
which by the way had no announcements at
e3 this year
rumors have long suggested that
Microsoft will roll out at least two
consoles similar in veins of the current
Xbox one X and the 1s there's also talk
of a console aimed exclusively at
streaming and that would complement
Microsoft's upcoming X cloud the
unveiled console is currently known as
project scarlet and much like the next
PlayStation console it will feature some
interesting hardware as expected
Microsoft is using a semi custom
solution from AMD based on Zen - no word
on core count but it's presumably an 8
core part like Sony's and these are DNA
architecture that is currently powering
Navi will also be present in some form
Microsoft is using GDD r 6 memory and is
using solid state storage Microsoft also
stated that the SSD will double as
virtual Ram 1962 called and had lost its
page file back
virtual Ram is not new and is in fact
very very old but because I this just it
gives you an idea of in the very least
who Microsoft thinks the crowd is
watching their e3 presentations and at
worst gives you a look at who the crowd
is watching the e3 presentations because
apparently virtual Ram was enough of a
marketing buzzword to get people excited
or something but anyway there's also
supposed to be hardware level support
for ray-tracing
a couple of things here we've talked
about in the past unlike Sony Microsoft
did not make any mention of audio or
potentially ray-traced audio which is a
thing by the way but it did talk about
hardware accelerated rate racing and
hardware accelerated rate racing is
something you've been able to do for a
very long time it's just that doing it
in real time that's the new part that's
the hard part we talked about this with
Gordon in one of our videos where I
mentioned that NVIDIA has sort of retro
actively invented rate racing and to be
extremely clear this time no we don't
think NVIDIA invented rate racing
obviously but the marketing around r-tx
was so strong that they've more or less
rear in the history whether
intentionally or by accident to the
extent that Nvidia is getting a lot of
credit for rate racing has completely
shifted the discussion of graphics to
rate race in which huge massive credit
Nvidia is marketing for being able to do
that something that has been otherwise
exciting primarily to CG students or to
movie makers maybe some game developers
but anyway accelerated rate racing by
hardware doesn't mean a whole lot we
need to see what it's actually doing
hardware accelerated rate racing could
be stuff you've been able to do forever
which is render scenes frame by frame
over a very long period of time in
blender or it could be something like
some really simplified version of trace
you know a couple rays for a mirror or
something like that in a game we'll see
we don't expect it to be obviously
anywhere as powerful as something like a
20 80 TI
which is half the size of an entire Xbox
on its own but we'll see what it does
Microsoft also touted 8k gaming and
noted that project Scarlett will be able
to deliver 120 FPS not at the same time
to be very clear at that so that's
mostly marketing hyperbole right now but
what's more likely is that support for
8k resolutions is potentially by way of
upscaling or maybe again through this X
cloud service and the 120 Hertz refresh
rates are probably going to be a well
definitely going to be at lower
resolutions sort of a rumor here but not
really and video super GPUs and what
they're getting what they'll be
Nvidia he is super at Computex
2019 and it was pretty interesting
actually because it's just ahead of the
AMD keynote so it's almost one of those
and video like let's test the waters and
see what Andy's doing maybe play a
little bit of head games with people and
if AMD makes a major announcement at
Computex then we'll announce what super
actually is that didn't happen yet but
we've been more or less telling you what
it's going to be for a while now and it
looks like everybody else is starting to
report the same stuff so super is
supposed to be functionally ATI refresh
and it looks like there's going to be a
2070 or 2060 and a 2080 that might get
some additional Artie tensor and CUDA
cores so it is I mean these these things
all exist within the SMS for the most
part so probably it's a TI refresh is
what it is just being called super this
time there's some conflicting theories
on just how many cores the new Torian
cards will receive so we won't speculate
just yet there a lot of different
numbers out there we're not going to
quote any of them because we don't know
which are accurate but Nvidia is
allegedly planning to achieve this be a
refined Turing silicon or in some cases
the cards receiving a cut-down version
of the Turing die from the card directly
above it
for example the super r-tx 2060 is
supposedly being retrofitted with a new
version of the TU 106 die found on the
RT x 2070 the super RT x 2070 will move
to a
moved to a chopped down to you 104 died
the super r-tx 2080 will receive a
beefier tu-104 die allegedly and there's
speculation of a cut back to you 102 dot
so we talked about the plans for
increased core counts or well we've
talked about TI refresh before which is
what we meant by that we've also talked
about increased memory speeds but the
more the firmer speculation out there is
now saying the our TX 2070 sorry 2080
super will be outfitted with eight
gigabytes of 16 gigabit per second G DDR
six which is a move over the 14 gigabit
per second previous version that's Giga
bits not gigabytes so more importantly
the super our TX 2060 or whatever it's
called should see a bump in memory
according to the new rumors this is not
one we've heard independently but two
eight gigabytes of G 6 from 6 and memory
speeds for that one will remain at 14
gigabits per second with the same being
allegedly true for the our TX 2070 so
the talk here is that basically this is
an videos play at reducing the existing
device prices and then putting in a new
tier where those were were slightly
above it which will allow an video to
more directly challenge AMD with its
Navi RX 5700 XT and 5709 XT cards that
are coming out Comcast everyone's best
friend violating the consumer protection
act 444 445 thousand times and Counting
can't be off by a thousand that would
that would make it seem like it didn't
matter that same state of Washington
also found that Comcast violated the
consumer protection act the hundreds of
thousands of times we stated Comcast was
caught non-consensual e signing up
customers for a worthless in quotes
service protection plan on top of
enrolling customers into the plan some
of whom actively declined it comcast was
also misrepresenting the cost of the
plan
Comcast was charging almost 31,000
customers for this plan and it
misrepresented or misinformed
18600 customers all-in-all Comcast raked
in about 85 million dollars from a
stupidest behavior between 2011 and 2016
on top of the 9.1 million dollar fine
which in contrast to the eighty-five
million dollars it made does seem quite
small Comcast will also pay an
undisclosed amount of restitution to
affected customers with 12% interest on
top Washington outlines Comcast
violations of the Consumer Protection
Act as such quotes 240,000 588
violations for signing up SPP customers
without their consent and 200 5260
violations for failing to disclose or
misrepresenting the recurring cost of
the SPP so ISP is once again proving to
everyone that they deserve our money
Huawei's woes continue tokyo electron
and WD are backing away from huawei
which has been struggling with the US
trade blacklist over the last month or
two despite trying to save face Huawei's
troubles continue to mount
after finding itself on the US trade
blacklist well I recently had to put a
hold on its development and
manufacturing of laptops smartphones may
be next
reuters reported that Western Digital
who has supplied Huawei with hard drives
and flash memory has suspended its
business with the company following the
blacklisting Western Digital CEO Steve
Milligan expressed concern regarding the
tension between the American and Chinese
economies quote the tech supply chain in
the world is quite entangled Milligan
said and went on to highlight that
untangling the tech supply chain would
not be good for the US or China in his
opinion also dropping Huawei is Tokyo
Electric the third largest supplier of
semiconductor manufacturing equipment
Reuters reports that at least one more
major Japanese semiconductor equipment
supplier is considering ceasing any
potential business with Huawei
well Tokyo electron isn't a us-based
company it is one that imports and uses
u.s. Goods and intellectual property
which means it needs to protect its
relations with the US much like arm LG
outs one-millisecond displays at e3 2019
as reported by overclocked 3d during e3
2019 LG announced the LG Ultra gear nano
IPS lineup which appears to be the first
IPS set of displays with a 1 millisecond
response time a luxury previously only
afforded to other panels on top of the
superior color
accuracy in production the IPS panel has
claimed to bring they also sport 144
Hertz refresh rates the lineup is
currently comprised of two models the 38
GL 9 v 0 G 38 inches and the 27 GL 850
27 inches 38 inch model sports a curved
screen with a 38 40 by 1600 resolution
while the 27-inch model is curved list
with a resolution of 2560 by 1440 both
use nano IPS technology and our g-sync
compatible which as a reminder decent
compatible that phrasing means basically
free sync it's it's different from
g-sync
the module and then algae and it's ultra
gear nano IPS models will be available
for pre-order July 1st of course we'd
recommend reading reviews from other
people because we don't review monitors
before pre ordering those pricing is to
be announced on them and then finally
are you ready to pone noobs with razors
new respawn drink or if you're a fan of
pure ownage you know it's pronounced own
it's if you watch the show 15 years ago
you'll get it
razor is now offering lethargic gamers a
new mental performance drink yikes
it would seem razor respawn is another
April Fool's joke that made it manifest
if anyone remembers project venom that
was the name of it circa 2010 so if
you've ever felt the need to put venom
in your body then not an energy drink
but a mental performance drink is the
right bet for you I don't want anything
more than respawn as a drink because
that implies that is probably going to
kill me
the drink comes in a powder form like I
guess Gatorade powder or something and
Razer is adamant that respawn is not an
energy drink despite the 95 milligrams
of caffeine respawn is available in four
different flavors it comes in a pack of
24 $25 separately there is a $30 respawn
branded tumbler available for purchase
no chroma RGB at this point
unfortunately although we hope to see
support in the future and if you're
not a gamer no problem razor also
insists that respawn is for sleepy
content creators the biggest buzzword of
2019 or anyone who sits at a computer so
everybody not limiting the market there
anyway we don't we just thought it was
kind of funny hopefully this doesn't
cause people to go buy it so that's the
venom that's the respawn drink that
razors doing thank you for watching
