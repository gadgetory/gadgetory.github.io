nexus dotnet and i just wanted to show
you our star citizen benchmark course i
recently benchmarked star citizen
subversion 09 22 alpha and it was a GPU
benchmark so it's really just an effort
of looking at how the game is performing
in its current development state and
it's it's looking pretty good so far
especially considering the original
launch of star citizen looked really
much much more alpha so to speak in that
it had far less developed graphics and
it was crashing and really had pretty
poor optimization with the current
version of the alpha i want to emphasize
very heavily that the graphics are not
final so they will generally look better
than this in the final version of the
game it is still very early and in
addition to this the optimization is not
final so we've got two elements that
will critically impact GPU performance
when the game launches which means that
my benchmark is not as definitive as
some of our other benchmarks with the
complete and shipped games in addition
to this the drivers aren't developed yet
because Nvidia and AMD and all the other
component developers in between have not
really had any and
means to build drivers for an incomplete
very early alpha game that said I ran
the test anyway because one I thought it
would be fun and star citizen looks
pretty good right now even though it's
not complete and to this gives us sort
of an indication as to where the game is
headed technologically and it gives an
indication as to what devices are
currently required to play if you are in
the alpha or beta and are sort of trying
to figure out if you'll be able to play
or not or if you'll have to wait longer
buy a new GPU so this was the benchmark
course it looks pretty good so far PBR
and things like that I don't think are
completely integrated right now but it
is certainly heading that direction and
I will have more videos and articles
about those in the future hit the link
of the description below for the full
benchmark article with the frame rate
performance charts and subscribe to the
channel because I've got another video
about this benchmark coming out shortly
that will recap the performance showing
you the actual charts if you did not
click on the article and that is all for
this time I will see you all next time
