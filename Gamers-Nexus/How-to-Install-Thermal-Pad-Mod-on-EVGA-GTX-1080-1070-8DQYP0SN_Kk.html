videos we've been talking about the EVGA
vrm heating issues and those have been
largely resolved through a two-step
process one is a BIOS update which is
not really required but it will increase
your fan rpm it's still in flux we
originally reported that it was a 2200
rpm fan target for load scenarios and
now it sounds like it's going to be
closer to 2000 so that's still in flux
but there will be a fan rpm change it
can be done through BIOS there's also a
thermal pad mod EVGA is calling this
optional I would actually call this the
recommended or required approach and
then the fan RPMs would be my secondary
but before getting to the tutorial of
how to install the thermal pads on the
EVGA 1080 FTW this content is brought to
you by AMD and they're affordable free
sync devices including this ultra wide
display that's 2560 by 1080 and is
available for $400 link in the
description below for more information
on that so for this mod which is it's
really trivial to do you don't have to
be intimidated by this if you've never
taken a part of card before we've taken
apart a lot of these pretty basic
process you will need a phillips
screwdriver
it's just like an a1 a head or something
like that so a phillips screwdriver will
do just fine EVGA technically recommends
a flathead I don't really think that's
necessary but if you want one it's
helpful for removing the fan headers
later on you'll also need the thermal
pad kit from EVGA so these are the pads
they have a wide and a narrow pad
included in the kit so the thermal pads
they provide you there's two of them
they measure about two millimeters thick
at the thickest that would be this one
and this one is 57 wide millimeters and
this one is 26 millimeters wide
so this pad goes on your inductors or
your chokes I'll show you where those
are and how to install it this one goes
on the back side of the card you'll take
this back plate off and then it goes
right in between these four screws and
I'll show you that as well so it's
easiest for this mod to start off by
this a new card so we're going to peel
that pair
once that's off they're the easiest way
to do this is to start with the base
plate and so to do that we need to
remove the cooler and the shroud itself
so I like to do a posing corner tear you
do not have to do that for removal but I
suppose it will still put less strain on
the car though it's really kind of
irrelevant so we'll take the cold plate
off and the with the cold plate of
course comes the heatsink and with the
heatsink will come the shroud which is
the front of the card it's four screws
very easy so that's done
when I lift this up you're going to see
that the rest of the card will kind of
fall off of it so you just lift up
gently and when you're doing this
yourself you should see that there's
play in here so there's play I'm not
going to pull it off and you shouldn't
either because it's still connected to
cables and those cables are for the fans
and for the LEDs in the card very easy
to get rid of there's one right here and
then I believe the other cable is also
on that side of the card so this one
just came out on its own when I pulled
the card up you don't want to pull at
the cables to get these out or at the
wires you should generally I just kind
of try and get some leverage in there
under the actual connector head and pull
it up you can also stab it with a flat
head which is what EVGA recommends on
the other side of this thing so you see
I just kind of pulled it out but if you
take a flat head if you're really
worried about it you can push the flat
head against that sort of clip right
there in the middle of the header have
you push there and then pull up at an
angle they'll come out just don't pull
by the wires but mine came out pretty
easily so there's things taken apart
we've got the cooler this that you'll
have to clean off we'll do that in a
moment
the GPU is now exposed to the GPU is the
silicon piece underneath that should
will be shiny when we clean it covered
by thermal paste right now just for
vocabulary reasons this agree
is the substrate you do not need to
clean that they're all pasted off the
substrate it doesn't really hurt but you
don't need to worry about it if there's
a ton on there these are your chokes
your inductors this is part of the vrm
this is part of what is heating up and
causing the articles online to talk
about thermal issues with the cards so
we need to cover these and create
contact from these to the heatsink
itself which will go back on this
orientation where this side aligns to
this so we're gonna have a thermal pad
right there but before that I do want to
clean off this thermal compound to do
this you can take a q-tip or the cotton
ball or just a paper towel and put some
rubbing alcohol on it 90% or better is
preferred I've got 91% here that's fine
you could use different percentage if
you've got it but that's just basically
going to clean this stuff right off get
it stuck to the paper towel and then the
alcohol itself will evaporate very
quickly from the GPU so we don't need to
worry about drying it really do the same
thing for the heatsink and what we're
going to do in a moment is use this
thermal compound that EVGA provided us
with and you'll get it to with your kit
and and that will be what replaces the
stuff that just came off so this
compound that EVGA provides is actually
not too bad it's a 5 watt per meter
Kelvin compound which is right there if
I watts per meter Kelvin is pretty
average so we can certainly use that you
won't need to buy anything special you
don't have to clean the compound off of
the GPU but it will be better for you
long run let's go ahead and get this mod
started so first of all we only need the
thin one this is the 27 26 millimeter
wide strip the narrow strip that will go
here and I'm going to go ahead and get
rid of this now which is cleaning to me
and that is concerning enough that I'm
going to go ahead and put it on an
anti-static bracelet as well just for
protection of the electrical components
because the static electricity is bad
again not a 100% required step but not
bad to do so this thin strip you just
need to get kind of positioned such that
the edge of it is against the edge of
the baseplate and you'll be able to see
this in a moment more clearly once I
move the cardboard and then centered
over the the chokes or the inductors if
you prefer let's try and Center that a
bit better okay and also make sure you
peel off the piece of plastic here
that's still stuck on my thermal pad
so once you've peeled the plastic off
your thermal pad we're going to put it
right on top of the chokes or the
inductors I'm going to try and Center it
and it should not exceed the length of
the base plate so just kind of cap it
right there at the edge of the base
plate like I've done you can see we're
right at the border of where it can be
apply a little bit of force right there
because there was an air pocket so we
are in good shape now the next step is
to reassemble the card before getting to
this step I would suggest taking a few
photos of the card for your own
reference of the cooler for your own
reference and for warranty purposes if
something goes wrong here EVGA will
assist you they've kind of already said
that in there and their replacement
upgrades warranty policy so that's all
done now we need to put some thermal
paste on and take the stuff they gave
you we just need a dot here in the
middle now let me just stay here for a
second
that YouTube's favorite thing to do is
to criticize thermal paste application
for a GPU it's not quite as sensitive as
a CPU where you have an IHS and you've
got your
cold plate and that's you don't want too
much they're all pasted in there this
thing one we're not worrying about a
conductive thermal compound that's going
to short anything so getting this on the
substrates not going to hurt your card
secondly it's a GPU so there's no IHS
it's just we're basically exposed
straight to the cold plate so don't
worry too much about this right if you
read the comment it's going to be like
that's way too much that's way too
little don't worry about it just copy
pretty closely to what I'm doing so
we're going to put on a dot it's going
to be about the size of a grain of rice
maybe a little bit tinier and I'm going
to go a little extra so that should
really be enough the the coat plate will
spread the rest of it on its own we
don't need a ton but it doesn't hurt to
have a little bit more than that either
this is just YouTube's favorite thing to
criticize for some reason so so we've
got enough compound on there now we need
to reattach this cooler part so it's the
same steps in Reverse these plugs go
into their headers on the board and I
have to move this a little bit out of
the way the camera but should be able to
do it okay so first one plugs in again
make sure you've got all of the plastic
off of that thermal pad before you put
this back together is one strip of
plastic on each side and then it should
be bare like kind of adhesive material
so you can see I've got the connectors
reconnected so we are ready to assemble
the card
I don't know finish putting this
together and now we just need to flip it
over to the backside where we can get
access to the screws there's four screw
holes line it up and kind of put the
card rest it there I'm just going to
move this board until it matches okay
so that is about where we want to be so
for these you just turn until it's
stopped so you don't need to apply crazy
amount of course they are spring tension
so turn it until it stops it has stopped
so I'm going to stop turning it you see
we've got our card back together and now
the next step is to do the rear side so
for this side we have to take apart the
back plate take the back plate off the
card the screws holding it in there's
just these ones outline and metal hold
it in so one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten thirteen screws
total that we have to take out you don't
have to take out the i/o a panel
protector thin one I'm just going to
turn this over and dump them all out at
the end two three four so at this point
depending on which card you have there
are rubber bumpers on these things like
one here one here one here these we can
leave alone on this FTW card this model
was sent to me by EVGA for this tutorial
it looks like they may have already
removed some of these pieces so I don't
have to but for their from their
instructions there's a an indication for
the FTW model that you'd have to remove
some of the rubber bumpers right here so
three of them total and then for the non
FTW model there's one which will be
right here and to give you an idea if
you have a non FTW card you will have a
rubber bumper right here but kind of
between the E and the V if you have an
FTW card then you'll have two strips
here and then one around the e area of
the card of the back plate so that's
where you would have to remove on an FTW
these two plus this one
I'm not FTW have to remove one that's
right around here so that's that's the
step we don't have to do it's been
already completed it looks like so now
we're ready to apply this thing this is
the second one of these this wider one
goes to the back of the vrm the vrm we
can look at it here this is all in this
section and EVGA is almost kind of over
compensated with this thing but I mean
more power to them I guess they kind of
had a problem to begin the first place
so we've got our MOSFETs and inductors
are right here and capacitor banks all
that so this thing same process get your
plastic off of there on one side at
least again it is static cleaning which
is not ideal but it's not going to hurt
anything probably so now we can place
this pad dead center of the the vrm and
between the four screw points I showed
you earlier which are going to be one
two three four so you're going between
those and you want to cover these parts
primarily so don't worry if you get that
on your pads because that is plastic
that will peel off so we're going to go
ahead and cover it just like this if
you're happy with it we can start
pushing it down on the card I'm
reasonably happy with it you're going to
want this to be within the confines of
the back plate which is outlined on the
card and white so if you're within the
white outline then you're in good shape
it's going to stretch a little bit
that's fine
just reposition it at this point the
rest of the pressure will be applied by
the back plate we can now put that back
on back plate should have four thermal
pads right here that's the back side of
the GPU you can see it lines up here
these four points on the GPU and so now
just drop that on there line up the
screw holes and you have modded your
card to have thermal pad so at this
point it's just screwing back in this
fourteen or however many screws it was
that I said earlier so that is how to
mod at your
to X 1080 FTW with thermal pads you
don't have to get the kit from EVGA it
is free but if they get backed up or
they don't have them in your country or
whatever you can buy your own pad with
the measurements I gave you earlier so
that was something like 2 millimeters
thick and something like 57 wide and a
26 wide for the measurements of the pad
so you could buy those yourself and you
could even buy a wider kit on Amazon or
wherever else I'll link some of the
description below it's an affiliate link
if you want help us out but you can buy
some from Amazon and then just cut them
to size that works perfectly fine you
just cut them with scissors so that is
how you do the cut mod pretty easy that
will basically solve all your problems
if you're really ultra concerned evj
will help you out with a replacement or
you could also download the V BIOS
update which sets a more aggressive fan
speed but you do sacrifice some noise in
favor of that so that's all as always
