cooler that we reviewed for thread
Ripper and we've gotten a lot of reports
recently just specifically in the last
couple of months that people who bought
these are having issues with corrosion
or just kind of gross bacteria growing
in the loop which is clearly not
supposed to happen but we reviewed these
and they performed pretty damn well
the Knox wet air coolers were highly
competitive but once you noise
normalized for a 40 DBA or something the
liquid coolers were on top for thread
Ripper and they were also the first
liquid coolers closed-loop available for
thread Ripper which made them a
compelling buy but one year later a lot
of reports suddenly have come out of
just users facing issues with the loop
effectively dying so today we're gonna
open up the two that we have and see if
it's happened to ours and then try and
figure out what we can learn from that
before that this video is brought to you
by Emma sighs RR t x 27 t gaming Z 8
gigabyte card the RT x 27 t gaming Z
uses MSI's dual fan design with large
blades which we've previously tested to
have them on the best noise normalized
thermal results in the class MSI is 27 t
gaming Z has a phat heatsink furthering
the focus on reduced noise levels by
allowing the fans to spin slower RGB
LEDs naturally are abundant on the card
but can be blacked out to match the
carbon and blackout shroud learn more at
the link in the description below this
is the 360 cooler we also have a to
something 240 it looks like both our
enter max lick tech TR for coolers enter
max came out with a lick tech TR for to
cooler later terrible name but there was
a second version later this is the first
version this the one that we think is
having problems and obviously this
points out a potential shortcoming and
reviews which is that we can't really
test for longevity when we post review
so revisiting this over a year later at
this point I think see how it's done
we're done with the 16:50 it's time to
open it up so this kind of gonna suck
because there's thermal paste jams and
all of the Torx head screws but let's
get started fortunately from the photos
I've seen you all send us on Twitter it
looks like most of the issue can be
discovered here so I don't think we have
to get into the radiator but my
understanding presently is that NR max
has mixed metals which isn't that
abnormal for these but has also not
added a biocide or and maybe not enough
of it okay so we're gonna start with
these fill caps because if there's gross
stuff in there I want to control empty
in it not empty it all over my hands and
if you want the service I'm working on
this is the medium mod mat underneath it
it's the large mod mat so on stored out
gamers nexus net you can pick those up
they are finally just about back in
stock at this point and they'll be
shipping out within a couple of days so
that's on stored Akira's access dotnet
if you want the work surface to protect
your table from things like algae and
bacterial growth or thermal paste is the
more more intended use case wow that's
freaking gross immediately that thing
right there and that and all that stuff
that was not in this bucket until I
emptied in part of this there's not a
lot of it yet but that's super nasty
though that came out
yes smells like a food court at an
abandoned mall definitely some junk in
there wow that's pretty fast oh yeah
there you go check out the rim
we're like the gasket was it's not as
bad as some of the ones I've seen online
I should know this one hasn't been in
use at all since the review so this is
probably I don't know if that makes it a
best case for a worst case but we do
have another one that's been in use more
frequently so yeah there's just some it
looks like just corrosion discoloration
maybe from the copper that's kind of
plated this plastic surface that's kind
of not great and then there's like
floating stuff in there but not a lot of
it not as much as I've seen from some of
you online and the gaskets really nasty
too like that gasket should not look
like that at all just the next question
is how does the cold blade itself look
and that's got some gross gunk in it too
and you can see corrosion there at the
edge so that is suboptimal oh yeah
there's a whole bunch of gunk on this
side it took me a second to see it
there's a layer of stuff that's just
like the that's significant because it's
not a lot of it but it's all in front of
the microphones and the water flows
through these to cool it so that's not
great to see still not as bad as some of
the ones online that's just a nameplate
there's the impeller and pellet is
actually not bad it's not really
anything in there and here's a gasket
also not bad some dust on it what
shouldn't really happen but not terrible
also it seems the issue was rather
limited on ours but we do have another
one we can look at I guess okay so this
one's actually been in use the other one
that really hasn't been so I guess we'll
find out with our small sample size it's
the worst for it to have been in use or
not the worst of it was it was sort of
down here in the cold place so we'll
just take this off straight away this
time
okay also kinda gross wow that one's
actually a little worse on the top can
you see that in there oh you know what
this is the one I took apart previously
and what I did with this one was I
refilled most of the coolant that came
with it and then whatever I couldn't
refill I topped off with ek cry of fuel
and biocide so the fact that this one's
got anything in there it's probably
residue from the gasket itself I wonder
if it's the gasket that's deteriorating
and then getting colored by the copper
or something but this one if it's in
better shape it's because I was the last
one to touch it
and as you can see by the color of the
coolant
I filled it with distilled water and I
believe cryo fuel and a biocide so that
would explain why this one isn't as bad
as the other one but the residue on top
of the cold plate does does make me
think that the gasket is deteriorating
and that's what's jamming up the micro
fins that people are talking about okay
so the second ones not so bad the first
one is the worst and the discoloration
on the cold plate that's a sort of black
and green I want to try and scrub that
out and see if it's gunk in there or if
it's just discoloration and this is AJ's
two cents tip I believe he specifically
recommends crest white so I can only
assume that he's a crest shell we have
Colgate I don't think this is gonna work
so yeah toothbrush on the block and I
guess we'll see if anything comes out of
it so I guess if you ever get those
toothbrushes from your dentist and you
our toothbrush elitist and have a better
one you should take them anyway and use
them for cleaning liquid cooling parts
Patrick don't use this to brush your
teeth
well there's definitely more stuff
floating around in the water
so for sure cleaner and some more stuff
came out and this bin when we scrubbed
it but ours wasn't that bad compared to
a lot of the ones you've sent in so
thanks for the two cents J a good trick
but I guess that's what you want to do
if you need to clean it it's not hard to
disassemble you've seen that reassembly
would be the same process in Reverse you
don't need to take the top of the well
you might want to take this the impeller
out I guess if yours is really gunked-up
but if you've seen their all's decline
get worse over time with this thing try
just taking the the Torx screws out of
the cold plate pull it out see if it's
bad and you'll just just refill it with
distilled water through the fill port on
the side of the block housing you can
refill it with just a funnel and
distilled water and if you want you
could add some cryo fuel like EK cryo
fuel mixture in there or a couple drops
of a biocide or something and that
should get you up and running because
the 240 that I had taken apart and
reassembled previously with distilled
water and the biocide I added and that
was mostly fine and it looks like just
residue from the gasket so anyway that's
what you do if you want to maintain it
as for the issue we saw a bit of one
here but not nearly as bad as the
several that have been sent in to us and
we've gotten probably like 15 of these
photos now which is a lot because most
people don't send photos in when they're
having issues so apparently this is a
known issue in the community we didn't
have it as bad here but there is
definitely I don't know maybe not enough
biocide or something like that in their
loop so that's it for this one
thank you for watching hopefully that
helps you at least clean it and
reassemble it you just do it in Reverse
