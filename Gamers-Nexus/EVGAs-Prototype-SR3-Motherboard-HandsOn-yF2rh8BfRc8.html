shows your Computex 2019 this one not on
a show floor so we have an EVGA asked
our three dark here you've probably seen
this online a bit this week I think EVGA
is jacob freeman probably tweeted it out
beginning of the week but we've got the
board here and i'm just gonna give you a
top-level run through this is not final
yet this is one of the first boards or
maybe the first board that EVGA has
gotten for the sr3 so some stuff could
change and we don't have full details
but you got to first look at it after
the one we gave you originally of just
the blank PCB from about March so this
is obviously quite a bit more populated
than that was before that this video is
brought to you by Corsair as an iron
claw RGB wireless gaming mouse the
Corsair iron claw focuses first on
comfort with its palm grip approach and
also uses a sub 1 millisecond wireless
connection for the PC you can toggle
between wireless and Bluetooth
connectivity making it easy to control
multiple pcs with one Mouse like a
streaming PC and a gaming PC the mouse
has 10 programmable buttons the pmw 30
391 18000 DPI sensor 3 zone RGB LEDs and
50-million click lifespan for left and
right mouse buttons
learn more at the link of the
description below for the basics that
lit the PCB 16 layers on the i/o up here
on the top you can see that there's will
get a biro shadow if there's 2 10
gigabit intel an rj45 s and then there's
another one gigabit from Intel next to
those the waterblock on the chipsets
also have immediate interest and also
extends to the vrm because the sockets
rotated so this is something the EVGA
has been doing with their 99 X 299 and
XIII 90 boards rotating the socket and
vrm which allows the some of the power
connector stand up over next to the 24
pin so you can rotate all those 90
degree angle and route the cables all to
one spot if you wanted to but this
follows the same trend EBG has been
doing and then the waterblock you've got
inlet outlet and micro fins on top of
the chipset and then cooling on top of
the vrm itself which is what you'd want
to run for any kind of overclocking for
the 3125 X or something like that which
is what this board is compatible with
it's also one of the smaller they're so
they're three of the board
600 series chipset boards that we've
seen and showered on the channel one is
the Dominus extreme gigabyte has one as
well I think it's the Auris extreme and
this board the SR 3 is smaller than
those especially than the Dominus so ie
ATX form factor you can fit it in more
cases which i think is one of the angles
EVGA has taken for this one
other features outside of just size and
fitment there's triple bios there's a
probe connector on the board if you
wanted to get DMM hooked up to it or
something right angle everything has
mentioned rotated socket as mentioned
replaceable bios down here so you can
pull the BIOS out and put a new one in
there's a BIOS update USB header on the
board and then PCIe switches over in
this area so you can toggle individual
switches which we actually used with
kingpin m10 on the stage at g.skill to
disable one of the cards so they work in
case you haven't used them before I
think that covers what we can say about
the board for now so this is as I said
subject to change but you get a look at
it and then we'll update you once it's
closer to finalization and maybe hits
retail also Tim's gonna have to unbend
some pins before he tests this Computex
is rough on it thanks for watching

I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
