explicit multi-gpu meaning that we can
finally pair AMD and NVIDIA GPUs in the
same system together or you can even
pair non same cards from the same
manufacturer so if you want to do a 970
to 960 for some reason you could
theoretically do that with DirectX 12 in
games which support explicit multi-gpu
functionality and the new ashes of
singularity benchmark is as far as we're
aware the first game to support
officially explicit multi-gpu and that's
what we're benchmarking here today we're
looking exclusively at the feature of
multi-gpu for things like a 390 x with a
970 a bit odd but should be interesting
970 s paired with one another in normal
SLI versus that set up and then a couple
of other things thrown in there as well
as you'll see throughout the video now
we're also doing a DirectX 11 vs.
DirectX 12 benchmark which will look
only at the DX 11 verse TX 12
performance so we can see where do AMD
and NVIDIA have their strengths and
weaknesses and that will be in a
separate video coming pretty much
immediately after this one but for today
we're looking at explicit multi-gpu when
we say the word explicit for multi-gpu
we mean that the developers have
low-level access to the hardware and are
able to better sort tasks so that vram
and other resources never go unused
this is contrary to DirectX 11 where the
API overhead obfuscates low-level access
and restricts developers in ways which
have limited game graphics especially on
multi-gpu platforms including the
standard SLI and crossfire setups with
explicit multi-gpu support the
developers are able to use all the vram
available from multiple devices
something that historically has not been
possible and they're even able to allow
mixed card or mixed a brand
configurations before diving deeper
though it's worth pointing out a few key
items here one mixed brand
configurations for GPUs should likely be
exceedingly rare so it's not necessarily
a real-world use case or benchmark in
that regard you wouldn't intentionally
build a new PC and just decide to buy a
fury ax and a 980 eye to use together
it's kind of a weird thing to do so it'd
be the type of thing that happens if you
somehow ended up with a spare GPU from
another vendor as
great or something like that number two
for this to build a PC intentionally in
this way would actually be risky as the
games would explicitly you have to
support this kind of combination and
they need to be dx12 enabled of course
which is not that prevalent right now
and it's unlikely that mixed brand
configurations would often be tested so
bugs and poor performance are probable
in the future for dx12 games as for same
brand configurations similar challenges
apply but the use case is more likely
and that a user may end up with for
instance a gtx 960 and want to move to a
970 or 970 you wanna move to a 980 TI
and with dx12 you could actually keep
the older card the lower end one and run
them both at the same time just put the
more powerful one in the top slot in the
event you have to disable the second one
for dx11 games or whatever and this
works for AMD as well if you want to do
a 390 X to a fury or something like that
the same development support flaw exists
but the use case is exceedingly more
likely oxide games built ashes of
singularity on their nitrous engine
which they call a fourth generation
engine and this takes a job based
approach to task management within games
so instead of doing something like cry
engine does currently anyway which is
basically spawn a thread for each
different task one thread for rendering
one for physics one for game logic one
for AI or sound or whatever instead of
taking that approach the job based
approach instead just assigns tasks as
they come in to all the threads as would
make sense for whatever type of CPU
you're using or API or whatever so in
the case of nitrous and the new engine
from oxide the DirectX 12 support
basically uses this job based approach
to send out all the jobs asynchronously
to whatever device should be processing
that particular job and by
asynchronously I mean that basically
it's sort of parallel processing within
parallel processing so on a GPU you're
already a parallel processing unit
that's what a GPU does it can process
multiple things simultaneously and
that's why they're so powerful for
things like graphics now with
asynchronous processing the bottleneck
the traditional bottleneck of sort of
queue blocking within the GPU is
eliminated and that's because even
though a GPU might be a parallel
processor it still builds up this queue
things that indirect x11 anyway needs to
execute in a certain order in order to
get to the next task and that is removed
with asynchronous processing and AMD
uses their ACPs for this and that's been
a particular talking point for Andy over
the past few months as you've seen in
some of our videos let's look at some of
our initial limited benchmarks so we've
run a few dozen tests over the past two
days on ashes of singularity and many of
these will be published in a separate
dx11 versity x12 article and video and
for now we're just looking at the one
question which is what happens when you
combine video cards of different make or
model and different brands so what
happens when we do these cross Brand
configurations for example one of our
tests was a 390 X with a 970 and we're
here to look at that performance because
the first time we've been able to
actually do that in a game in a real
world scenario because ashes of
singularity supports MDA and Lda
approaches to multi graphics we thought
it'd be fun to test what happens when we
use this MDA approach which is multi
display adapter that means you eliminate
the bridge and you in this case mix an D
with Nvidia we used an SLI bridge for a
normal GTX 970 s an SLI without going
cross ground across model or anything
like that and you can see all of those
initial results here and video devices
currently show almost no difference
between DX 11 and DX 12 within ashes of
singularity and that's something we
currently suspect is attributable to a
lack of driver support looking strictly
at dx12 explicit multi-gpu functionality
running a gtx 970 and an r9 390x in
conjunction yields a pretty significant
gain over just a standalone 390 X or
even a standalone GTX 970 this is
because the game is able to access
features on both cards and utilize them
more fully creating a sort of
Frankenstein's monster version of the
more familiar SLI and crossfire setups
the average FPS for our 390 X plus 970
config at 1080p and high settings with
two tab MSAA you may know as 2x MSAA ran
96.5 FPS on an impressive average frame
time of just 10 point 3 6 milliseconds
very consistent throughout the test and
consistent enough that there's little
visible tearing for the most part now
with a single 970 or even SLI 1970s we
did see pretty substantial tearing at
times and that ties back into the driver
issues when you're running an Nvidia
device as a primary or SLI setup for the
GPU the 390x stand-alone pushed sixty
five point seven MPs average which is a
thirty seven percent difference against
the weird combo configuration we ran and
a single GTX 970 runs at fifty point six
five FPS presently about twenty six
percent slower than the 390x and 62
percent slower than the combo config SLI
GTX 970 s were unimpressive at this time
running only forty one point five
percent faster than a single GTX 970
and markedly slower than our unlikely
and the Nvidia combo what you're looking
at now aren't our charts but they're
actually charts generated by ashes of
singularity now these are specifically
for the DX 11 bench that we ran the DX
12 bench contains even more metrics and
charts and the purpose of showing these
on the screen is really just to
demonstrate to you how truly
overwhelming the data provided by ashes
of singularity is it's a massive amount
of data at times it felt more like data
dredging rather than data analysis and
there's a lot of crunching we still have
to do for additional content for ashes
over the next few days and for DX 12 and
11 and all that so do stay tuned for
that as for now looking at our own
charts and data for explicit multi-gpu
functionality we can definitively state
that cross manufacturer GPU support is
functional seems reasonably well
supported by the nitrous game engine and
is definitely an interesting item to
look at for performance in the future
now is it something you'll use as an end
user is it an actual use case in the
real world I don't really think so but
it's certainly cool it's interesting and
for those off cases where it is a use
case where it will happen in real
computers then well it looks like it's
supported this is all very interesting
though AMD presently holds a very clear
advantage with DX 12 in this specific
game I have not published any other game
tests just yet but do stay tuned for
those because that could be where it
gets a bit more interesting between two
manufacturers for now though for ashes
of singularity specifically and these
definitely got a lead in terms of
the dx12 performance gains over dx11
they've really shown their AC e ability
here they're asynchronous compute engine
is getting to stretch its legs of it
finally with this better API and that
means they're taking pretty big strides
forward from their dx11 performance
which is actually pretty pretty darn bad
so the dx12 gap versus dx11 that delta
for AMD is quite large
whereas nvidia we're seen for the most
part identical performance between 11
and 12 and that's really just a lack of
probably driver support right now we'd
think for this particular game and we'll
try and stay on top of that as things
change but for the immediate future we
are looking at a DX 12 with DX load and
benchmark check back for that and as far
as the asynchronous processing on multi
GPUs that are not the same brand
manufacturer it works it's kind of cool
but what do you do with that information
really other than its neat so that's all
for this time if you like this type of
