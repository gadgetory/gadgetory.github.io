together building a PC is too damn hard
even in 2016 that is what a website
recently said in one of their articles
and I take issue with this so we really
really don't make it a point to talk
about what other publications post but
this article was sort of attacking the
idea of building pcs and that's what we
focus on so when you attack that idea as
via mentally as they did I want to make
it a point to counter and defend the PC
building culture as it should be so
here's the thing this article from said
website just lifting that up no
particular reason the article points out
that building a PC is quote too
expensive far too expensive they say
they say that the sis would cost too
much more if you want to go to someone
like cyber power and have them build
your gaming PC instead and then they go
on to recommend Apple and I don't need
to point out the irony there further the
article says beginning to end the
process of building a computer took me
almost five hours and I had to make
emergency calls to another editor in the
process and he says once I couldn't
figure out why the fans weren't spinning
prior and plugged in and again when the
computer didn't recognize the ethernet
cable probably no drivers and then also
said and this is my favorite part
I was literally bleeding from a cut on
my hand by the end of it which YouTube
guide said was common quote I bled for
this in thing those were the words
published on the website so that stated
you know aside from potentially bleeding
out in the process of building a
computer I'm going to show you how easy
it is to build the system we have a full
guide on this it's only 23 minutes long
which for the full process is not bad
you can go there if you want really the
specifics and you're actually first-time
builder here we're going to speed build
the system I'll show you how quick it is
to put something together we're going to
pick parts off of our own rack and just
pretend it's a micro Center or fries or
whatever and put it together quickly put
it together properly and and sort of
dispel some of this insanity that was
published people who build their own PC
these aren't like garage woodworkers
building their own birdhouses they're
not making anything in the same way
someone might restore an old hot rod
they're just taking different parts from
different companies and plugging them
together so I'm not not sure exactly
what those three different analogies
mean but if you're restoring a hot rod
you're probably not actually creating an
engine in your garage birdhouses is
totally nonlinear but let's let's do
this thing let's pick out some parts and
put together a budget system because
this dude was like I picked a gtx 1070
and an i7 and building computers is way
too expensive and he also already had a
monitor and it probably is a 1080p
monitor but we'll worry about all that
in the somewhat of a warehouse room
let's go over there okay so my objective
is pretty simple I want to be able to
play games with fairly high settings
Bahai to ultra at 1080p or 1440p and we
have the hardware for that so first off
let's start with a cpu choice I've got a
ton of CPUs down here as you'll see in
b-roll and we're just going to go with
an i3 6300 for the CPU don't need
anything too crazy so we've got an i3
that is I believe 150 ish dollar part
I'm going to take the radiator off of
this so we've got this be 150 a will
take the liquid cooler off but something
on that's more affordable slightly but
I'm still going to put a liquid cooler
on there
they'll just be a cheaper 120 millimeter
and the reason I put in a liquid cooler
on there I would recommend going with
either a stock cooler or an air cooler
for this build but the article
specifically calls out liquid coolers as
being very difficult to work with so I
want to put one of those on there and
show you that it's not need a video card
let's grab this rx 480 that we've been
working with for far too long now that's
a 40 that's a $240 for the 8 gigabyte
480 so I'll grab one of those this is a
corsair CX 500 that's a pretty cheap
part 500 Watts not modular I think it's
50 dollars before debate after rebates
and promos it's like 30 or 20 or
something we need Ram notice this fury
this is fury let's grab two sticks of
this even though
four stick kit I was like twenty four
hundred megahertz or something so we've
got eight or sixteen gigabytes but
that's another 50 bucks for eight
gigabytes of that there's a one terabyte
WD blue these are fifty bucks
so we'll grab a WD blue for 50 bucks
case I'm going to use either an NZXT
s340 or a course here for 100 C
depending on which one doesn't require
me going into the Attic to get it'll be
either $75 or $100 so our whole PC build
yes the prices are a little bit kind
there there okay but you could certainly
do better if you had Newegg accessible
to you but we're not doing that we're
going from what we have so we're in this
600 to $700 range for the build
it is not exorbitant ly expensive quite
obviously let's put this thing together
and see if it takes five hours to do so
we're going to try and turn this into a
bit of a learning opportunity rather
than just beating up the author over the
article first of all building a system
I'm going to speed build this thing
and I need to be attached actually to my
anti-static wire so let's just go ahead
and do that we've explained all this and
how to build a PC video but installing a
CPU cooler specifically a radiator the
author's sort of states that installing
a CPU cooler that uses liquid is a huge
pain and that's really the opposite of
what I've found to be true so when
you're installing one of these things
it's best to do it outside of the case
and get it all situated first and then
once it's done we can drop this whole
board preassembled into the case and
simply attach the radiator to one of the
fan slots let's get this thing attached
I'm hoping for a few minutes here
alright so the CPU is socketed or well
yeah CBO socketed coolers ready to go I
think I think that'll give us the best
mobility having the tubes in that corner
okay this is simple as well I'm going to
do opposing corners the thermal paste is
already applied to the base the cold
plate of this cooler maybe the tubes in
that corner really isn't where I want
them but this is an ASA tech cheap 120
millimeter liquid cooler it's not
branded or anything the tubes are very
short I don't if you buy a sort of
branded real finalized liquid cooler
they will be much longer tubes and give
you better flexibility so you can mount
you can position them wherever you want
relative to the CPU but this is a good
cheap liquid cooler just to prove a
point that they are not in fact a
monster to install you don't want to
over-tighten these so I'm just going to
once over these are all exactly where
they should be so that is done let's get
this Ram socketed this goes into slot
two and four if we only have two sticks
which we do so this is a simple push the
pins aside drop the stick in use thumbs
pop it and we're good so this is done
now it's time to let's get the power
supply in the case next all right so
we're good to go there that goes into
the case there's only one way it can go
in I'm just going to stuff all these
cables in not really stuff that you need
to see on camera but we'll show it all
at the end anyway
I guess that slides into the s340
okay good good nah okay so the original
complaint was that it's very difficult
to mount to a radiator because he was
trying to screw in everything all at
once
here's my trick I put the case on the
side this is about eight of these screws
don't get lazy with these just screw
them all in you'll notice I've got the
radiator just hanging over the side of
the case this is the way I recommend
doing it we're going to install it as
rear-mounted the author kind of said it
takes a day of research just to make
sure everything is compatible maybe your
very first time
try to do it alone but really isn't an
issue so I would recommend either our
forums our comment sections
reddit's build a pc section will take
care of you if you have questions so
between all those different resources
there's plenty of things available where
people can personally help you
compatibility check stuff so here's the
the quote that made me choose a radio
liquid cooler even though I'd normally
do air the quote was but getting there
was a nightmare it is by far the most
difficult project I've ever bought and
put together obviously has never bought
anything from Ikea really there is no
good way to do this pretty good way to
do it but the one part that stood out to
me well has when I'm pushing a water
cooler down on the CPU while twisting
its radiator into place and screwing it
into place at the same time big grown-up
reverence it becomes clear that pcs that
don't just work quoting I suppose
Apple's marketing campaign so we've
mounted this first that goes first that
reduces the workload substantially once
that's there
take the radiator tubes down you want
them oriented down the pump will work
better with gravity gravity that way oh
I do tubes down that will work the best
with the cooler that we have and really
most of them on the market that's just
because of gravity pretty basic stuff
and the radiator no twisting and turning
involved okay there's one too but that
is the last screw all that's left is
installing the hard drive connecting the
cables for the most part this is about
as straightforward as it gets
GPU installation very simple there we go
GP is installed not the hardest thing
I've ever done I'll say that much okay
so cables that's all it's left
need one of those is there cut out in
the power supply shred
yes there is one of these this is this
one now we need to say to cable that'll
stay behind this thing
let me need a CPU header 24 pin it goes
in the 24 pin slot that's right there
ignore the flexing of the motherboard I
know someone will comment on it and I
don't care I'm going to plug in the PCIe
cable into the RX 4 80
hide the rest of it down back in the
hole where it came from and now we've
got to connect the 8 pin which really I
should have done before the radiator
honestly so I can see that actually done
how oh look at that oh nice
now it can be exactly like the guy from
the article look guys I got a cut just
from building a computer ah so now we we
have properly followed the motherboard
guide and I've cut myself by jamming my
fingernail over hey over a pin but
that's it that's the computer we built
so at this point I'll just do as you all
know all I do is connect the hard drive
via SATA cable hard drive goes in the
bottom of this box right here and we
install Windows hundred bucks with a
little less maybe and call it a day
so how's that for free system Billy that
was what was that maybe I don't know not
too long less than 20 minutes
certainly not 5 hours I'll make a quick
note about standards there was a cry for
standards in the article saying that pcs
are too hard to assemble because there's
no standardization everything is just a
wild-west of components type of thing
here's the thing a molex cable
standardized PCIe slots standardized if
you really want to kind of make bigger
points this is an ATX form factor
motherboard that is a fixed standard
a fixed size and spec that it must fit
within to be called an ATX motherboard
the power supply ATX form factor power
supply the case ATX form factor
supporting case ddr4 memory 288 pins I
don't know how much more standardized
you could get because that's it's all
standards 80 plus that's another one
power sits well that's that's a
certification let's be fair but it's
kind of in the same tune where it's all
it's got good definitions in the
industry you can research it all so
here's the thing
this article was a little silly it was
blown way out of proportion how hard it
is to both computers I felt personally
inspired to just show how we could speed
build a system yes I do I have done this
I know what I'm doing even a first time
builder though you could watch this
video for the most part be like oh yeah
that makes sense I'll just do that so I
don't know he says accessibility isn't a
priority for most enthusiast users so
there's no reason to make the experience
of getting to PC games easier yeah this
is pretty easy but if you wanted to make
it easier you could buy a pre-built
system from any number of sis and they
don't cost three hundred to five hundred
dollars more to build as as the article
said we've talked about this a lot of
them are one hundred two hundred dollars
which sure you could pick out better
components yourself but it's not
unreasonable and then turn around and
recommend Apple just really obviously
shows that there's no foundation here
for an article so there's a speed build
check out the patreon like the post roll
video to help us out directly more
content on the channel as always thanks
for watching I guess hopefully we
debunked that hysteria and I'll see you
all next time
it doesn't it doesn't have to be this
way is that a spider that's read</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
