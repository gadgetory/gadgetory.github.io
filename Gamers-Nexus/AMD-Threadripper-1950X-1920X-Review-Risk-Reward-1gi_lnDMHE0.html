risin architecting started with server
class epic chips that later were worked
down into consumer lines and so thread
rivers should more fully expose and
these multi die architecture and its
benefits and performance but CPU to ship
at $800 to the 1920 X and $1,000 the
1950 X both of which are on the bench
review today and they also both pose a
serious threat to intel's newly launched
skylake x high-end lineup we're focusing
on game streaming power thermals blender
and premiere performance and other items
along the way with a lower weight splash
of gaming just for perspective before
getting to that this video is brought to
you by synergy the software that lets
you share a keyboard and mouse between
multiple systems if you have limited
desk space and multiple computers to
command synergy removes the need for
separate peripherals or a KVM and works
as over the network software use our
link below to get 50% off the basic or
pro version we've a lot to get through
today so there will be no fluff at all
you can click the link in the
description below for the article if you
want background information on thread
Ripper but for now we're just focusing
on getting to the benchmarks from the
video before going through those a few
items of note on thread referee overall
overclocking is not going to be the most
impressive thing you've ever seen with
thread rippers there are reasons for
that we'll explain those but in some of
the charts you will see lower
performance with the all core overclock
than with the out of box performance the
main reason for this is XFR or extended
frequency range and with thread ripper
Andy has a two hundred megahertz XFR
over the advertised boost
so if advertised boost is 4.0 it goes up
to 4.2 and it can do that on four cores
this means that applications which use
fewer cores like games and a lot of
instances will do better stock because
they can use that XFR to boost to 4.2
gigahertz or something like that plus
200 rather than an all core boost a 4.0
where half or more of the cores are
never even touched to begin with so if
you see it results that looked higher
with the out of box config that's the
reason we're still showing 4.0 gigahertz
overclock and some of the charts though
just because I'm sure people are curious
but we were not stable all core over
4.0 without just absurd voltages so
that's the first note the next note is
there are two memory modes with Red
River distributed and local these are
also known as uniform memory access and
non-uniform memory access or uma and
Numa distributed is the default mode and
tends to work best for content creation
tasks as uma isn't restricted to one die
and allows the scheduler to do whatever
want Numa tends to be better in some
games what restricts workloads to one
die and the memory attached to that die
there are creative applications that
minimize thread sharing and
synchronization between cores so they're
not that latency intensive and that's
why you would see better performance
with the other mode as opposed to games
which do actually care a lot about
latency and synchronization in most
cases because you might be synchronizing
things like the physics and game logic
threads or AI threads or things like
that so Numa tends to be better in these
use cases we do have tests of these in a
V but they'll be coming out separately
however we have tested for today the AMD
bundled game mode which disables half of
the cores and switches the memory access
mode to local let's start with streaming
benchmarks while gaming these are two
tasks that are intensive and perform
simultaneously so stream game video
playback from the stream and then we
have other benchmarks that are dual
stream or streaming while recording and
the reason that those came out is
because the single stream benchmarks
while gaming were simply not intensive
enough to show any difference whatsoever
between the thread Ripper and the 3900 X
there it was just too easy for them and
so we started introducing other tests
and one of those was the dual streaming
with dota 2 streaming to twitch and
YouTube simultaneously like we do the
7900 X review the other one was a
streaming csgo while recording that
locally and they were also both really
not that intensive when you've got 32
threads to work with but we'll go
through the results anyway we're
focusing on the more intensive tests
here since the single stream output
tests were just trivial for both CPUs to
handle to be fair they're also trivial
for an r7 1700 to handle as
previously so it doesn't really teach us
anything new that we can focus on here
first up is our simultaneous streaming
of dota 2 to youtube and twitch which we
ran with the h.264 faster preset the
output is 1080p 60 with YouTube's
bitrate at 10 megabits per second and
Twitch's bitrate at 4 megabits per
second these outputs cover all the bases
with the most common stream setups when
we pulled our audience as seen here you
end with this tremendous load on the CPU
is we drop effectively zero percent of
the frames on all tested devices we'll
look at the 1920 X in the very near
future that would be fair to assume that
that would perform about the same given
where the ten core Intel and 16 core AMD
parts land that is to say probably
dropping 0% to frame as far as the
viewers experience is concerned both of
these CPUs output effectively a perfect
60 FPS to 2 streaming services
simultaneously you would not be able to
tell the difference as a viewer and
that's a good thing they're both good at
this task here's a look at the FPS
output to the player now that we know
what the viewer experience is like when
dual streaming the 1950 X manages 79 FPS
average to the player though dips down
somewhat in frame times toward the 1%
and 0.1% slow its frame times the 7900
acts performs well ahead here but we
also know that dota 2 does tend to favor
intel parts we were previously
benchmarking dirt rally for this test as
well but unfortunately it doesn't work
here because thread Ripper just doesn't
work with dirt rally without disabling
out the course that's more on the game
development side because it just doesn't
know what the hell it's looking at when
it's East 32 threads so it freaks out
and crashes the 7900 axe is doing well
though but regardless of that thread
Ripper is still hanging on and could be
tuned for better performance is
perfectly acceptable here considering
that the stream output is delivering
100% of the frames in a game that tends
to be against and these favor to begin
with so things are looking good to start
with for thread Ripper ultimately if you
wanted extreme frame rates and
consistent frame times anyway it'd
probably just be best to build a
separate capture box off of the work
both still do well here though these
7900 is outperforming the 1950 accent
player side same rates we have to give
Intel major credit here there is 79
stocke CPU when streaming is performing
more or less better than Andy is 1950 X
when it's not streaming particularly if
we're assigning more weight to the lower
end frame time performance
so the 7900 X is doing very well in this
particular benchmark and with both at
$1,000 it's probably the better buy if
you're playing csgo specifically but
this is not the complete picture because
again we're testing dota2 and csgo right
now both of which come from the same
company and both of which probably show
the same favor in terms of optimization
so for a more complete picture what
we'll have to do is revisit this once we
get to the 1920 X streaming bench works
and try to add a couple more games so
keep an eye out for that strictly for
this game intel's doing well just keep
in mind that there is a lot more to the
complete picture as we learn more about
thread Ripper as advantages but we'll
look at power metrics in a moment to see
how that battle shapes up and see if the
1950 X can claw back any advantages
outside of FPS during the csgo recording
and streaming tests with medium encoding
speed which we had to step down from
faster because it faster just simply
wasn't intensive enough and neither was
medium for the record the I 970 900 X
was consuming 193 watts of the EPS
12-volt rails when under average peak
conditions the thread Ripper 1950 acts
consumed about 134 to 140 watts average
peak power this is a significant
reduction from what the 7900 X uses
that's a good thing the 7900 X does
outperform the 1950 action player side
frame rate with this game but the 1950 X
outperforms it in power consumption
competing with a 27% reduction over the
7900 X with equivalent viewer side
output just the player side that changes
let's plot temperatures on the right
axis now in the same charge during this
synchronized csgo workload we see the
700 X ramping up to an average peak core
temperature of 60 to see the 1950 X is
around 57 c on average ambient is
accounted for in these measurements as
well not a huge difference particularly
when considering that t.j.maxx is
different for each CPU but that's what
we're looking at for temperatures during
the streams we could do a lot more with
this but most of the actually all of the
other
that we ran we're just so much lower
intensity that it's they're both good
they both deliver honor to some of the
frames there's no point in looking at
the data it would be like it's just it's
a pointless benchmark we ran the test
anyway because normally those are
actually pretty hard for CPUs to handle
but when you're looking at a 10 core
twenty thread part and a sixteen core 32
thread BART they're irrelevant so that's
what we have for now the numbers here
indicate that if you wanted to with
thread or especially you could step down
from the medium preset that we use to
something even slower which means a
higher quality output technically
although you start entering placebo
territory it could handle it it could
keep up if you wanted to do that but for
now we're using medium it all looks good
and the CPU is perform effectively
identically on the stream viewer side
output one other item of note here you
play around a lot with affinities and
priorities with streaming we know this
we've done it a bit in the past didn't
do it here because it just wasn't
necessary so there's something to be
said there if you would rather not fuss
with any of it then certainly one of
these two CPUs would be a good solution
to that assuming you don't want a
separate box because now you never touch
the affinities or priorities unless you
run into a really odd use case like
their rally or codemasters games which
just don't work but that's not a big
deal you turn on game mode and rise a
master and it works fine at that point
though you lose half your cores but
that's a that's pretty limited sample
size from what we've seen so far and it
should go away in the future but that's
what we're looking at if you are ok with
playing around with things then you can
buy the cheaper CPUs assuming this is
the only thing you want to do with them
anyway and just while we're here one
quick note on VR it'll be fine
vr works well on the 1700 it works well
in the 7700 K they are imperceptibly
different and you won't see any benefit
from going to these higher core account
part anyway moving on to power next this
is a good time to segue into those we're
measuring at the EPS 12 volt rail for
power consumption this is not aggregate
wall draw like we used to do from the
power supply directly to the CPU we also
have high performance mode set for these
measurements to keep that in mind idle
via thread Ripper CPU the 1920 X and a
1950 X
we're both consuming about 8.6 watts
which is within measurement error of the
r3 and our seven CPUs accounted for
especially by the motherboard change
overclocking gets us up to 22 watts to
30 watts draw Idol when using the
high-performance power plan
comparatively we measured the 7900 X at
49 watts idle in the same power plan
though both CPUs can draw less when
using a more conservative performance
mode and blender the thread Ripper CPUs
sit within a variance range of one
another again both that around 145 Watts
on the EPS 12 volt cables this puts our
thread refer CPUs consuming about 10
percent more power at stock than the
overclocked 17 100 the 7900 x stock CB
runs the same blender test at 171 watts
but it's overclocked experience at 2:24
third row remains remarkably efficient
and it's out of box States but starts
guzzling power when overclocked on
higher voltages to sustain an all core
Oh see we're at 274 watts when
overclocked on the 1950 X and to 12 on
the 1920 X and as you'll see in our
benchmarks for blender it's not worth it
total war Warhammer Paul's 75 watts when
the 1950 axis is at its stock
configuration using creative mode and 53
when the 1920 X's in its stock
configuration note that these are with
Auto voltages on the zenith the stocks
are 900 x consumes 93 watts for the same
task with overclocking pushing both
flagships to 100 watt territory for
prime95 Cinebench fire strike and others
check the article linked below here's a
quick look at thermals over time in a
prime95 28.5 L FFT torture workload
note that this chart shows spikes as the
test iterates between larger FFT sizes
so you'll see a thermal torture scenario
enumerated as power and fft cycles
iterate the assembly line hard ax runs
warmest here using our X 62 and set a
delta T over a meter around 50 C peak
average as FFT size progresses we see
that the 1950 ice begins to heat up more
and reach what is more or less a
steady-state at 44 C delta T over
ambient keep in mind that distance from
TJ Max is different on AMD and Intel
processors so the significance of this
temperature will vary between them until
maintains a distance from TJ Maxx of
about 25 C in this test we think that
AMD is t.j.maxx on threader is about 85
to 90 see that we haven't been able to
confirm this directly that assumption is
based on observations of when thread
Ripper throttles in one of the tests if
that's the case the summe 990 C t.j.maxx
with a high end and D maintains a
distance of about 22 to 25 C also not so
different in this case anyway more
thermal discussion in the article
getting into production workloads next
we start with our in-house blender
animation for CV workload benchmarking
the threader 50 views don't even need a
highlight they're all on top that will
highlight them anyway the 1950 X
completes our render in 15 minutes a
remarkable speed considering we were
only recently impressed with the our 779
it's 27.6 minute completion time
this performance places the 1950 X ahead
of the $1000 700 X CPU on overclock to
4.5 gigahertz even the $800 1920 X
manages to keep pace with this 7900 X a
line item coming in $200 cheaper and
about same rendered performance it's
clear that the 1920 X carries the trend
of lower skew AMD CPUs offering the best
value that said the 1950 X does reduce
render time by a still noteworthy 19%
over the 1920 X it's not a bad price for
such a reduction assuming you're doing
something that will actually leverage it
otherwise the 1920 X is looking
impressive from this testing and serves
a good value proposition off to a good
start on this one Adobe Premiere is next
this test uses one of GM's own project
files as a benchmark for a real workload
and positions the 1950 X again at the
top of the chart well aside from the
CUDA accelerated workers anyway premier
still benefits from boosted CPU
performance for certain types of renders
though it is not the most optimized
application you'll ever use regardless
and I think that the X completes the
render in 41 minutes with the 1920 X
finishing the render 14% slower at 46.6
minutes
just behind this is the 7900 xcp at 54
minutes
it was overclocked variant does clawback
a good amount of ground for perspective
the r7 1700 X overclocked to 3.9
gigahertz finishes the rendered 62
minutes showing that the similarly
clocked 1920 X provides a 25% time
reduction from its extra cores pov-ray
multi-threaded rendering is next and
post the 1950 X completing the workload
in 46 seconds followed by the 7900 X 4.5
gigahertz OCC VF 51
seconds surrender time increases 11%
here and is followed next by the stock
1920 X CPU for perspective our
highest-scoring r7 CPU completes the
words in 76 seconds multi-threaded for
render time increase of 64% from the
19th of the Xbox CPU here's the single
threaded version of this test here it's
clear as day that Intel still holds a
significant lead in single threaded
performance the 1700 X is impressive in
this regard and completes the 1 threaded
worth load in 565 seconds for a 22% time
reduction from the 1950s stock CPU
that's a big jump in Intel's favor and
also coincides with Intel's still
stronger performance and other single
threaded intensive applications but
that's also not news don't buy the rise
in architecture CPUs if you want the
strongest possible single threaded
performance or highest IPC for most
folks in the enthusiast content creation
audience though thread count holds a lot
of relevance and so rising architecture
is completely valid and should be
considered in those use cases
moving on to games briefly here because
it's really not the focus we're more
interested in the game streaming aspect
of it if you skip to the part where we
talked about how overclock and core is
impact games now is a good time to go
back and watch that before confusing
comments are posted that's discussed
right after the ad spot walk through a
handful of game benchmarks next again as
this is an h EDT platform we're more
interested in the X through 99
configurations from the standpoint of
gaming while streaming but we'll just
look at gaming anyway it's just not
weighted as much for a TD T and the
thread rate for CPUs benefit in total
war Warhammer from game mode which
requires a reboot and disables half the
cores then switches the memory mode to
local from distributed stock with the
distributed memory mode and 16 cores the
1950 act operates an average of around
127 FPS with lows at 82 and 42.8
rebooting with local memory access and
half the cores enabled we operate
instead at a significantly boosted 146
FPS average with lows also significantly
boosted to 109 1% and 68 fps your 1%
lows that's about a 20 FPS gain for each
category
the average FPS bump is about 15% with
game mode in this particular title and
is well worth it
here's where it gets interesting notice
that the all core 4 gigahertz overclock
which overrides xfr and other features
is
for me noticeably worse than the stock
configuration this is partly because of
acts of art which occasionally boosts
threads to frequencies between 4.1 and
4.2 and he has done well with xfr here
that's the story in the takeaway the
range has expanded significantly you now
with plus 200 megahertz are abused and
it functions well enough that it
actually be worse the overclock in some
games like this one
as for the 1920 X for seeing competitive
performance the 1950 X largely because
just based on thoughts right now a game
doesn't understand what a 16 core CPU is
or what to do with it compared to levy
7900 x stock CPU operates a 168 FPS
average with 70 FPS 0.1% low values and
so a significantly boosted over the 19
to the X in this particular workload
1440p won't change the scaling much
unless running something very graphics
intensive or with a lower end GPU like
lower end relatively like a 1080 Nandi
eye but 4k will 4k will be the great
equalizer here if gaming on higher
resolutions the performance gap somewhat
minimizes that it becomes a GPU
bottleneck at that point o games that
don't understand the threads will still
need gaming mode to resolve frame
latency issues even at higher
resolutions as usual though none of
these HEV TCPS are good value for gaming
you're way better off buying something
like an R 5 or an i7 7700 K for
something like this but those won't
handle workstation tasks nearly as well
GTA 5 is our next title and posts an
average FPS of 116 for the 1950s stock
CPU with 1% letters at 62 and 0.1%
calculating out to 32 FPS these low in
frame time performance metrics are
pretty damn bad but that's because the
game doesn't know again what to do with
the CPU the frame times are inconsistent
enough that we're experiencing visual
stuttering
to a point where it's really not worth
having the extra cores enabled
fortunately enabling the gaming mode
toggle and rise and master helps resolve
this issue game mode brings up the worst
0.1% frame times to about 50 FPS
effectively eliminating the stuttering
or hitching average is roughly the same
the 1920 act stock review isn't affected
in the same way given us a lower core
count and so enjoys the benefit of a 50
fps 0.1% low out of the box with
averages proportionately higher overall
we think part of this is because CPUs
are the same core account as the 90
20 X have already existed so it's not
unreasonable to expect some level of
optimization of the code for them for
reference the 7900 x operates at 145 FPS
average and this boosts FPS about 26% of
the 19 to the X stock CPU ashes
escalation post the 1950 exit 47 FPS
will close at 33 31 there's one of the
few tests where we consistently saw
higher thread counts utilized and is
also one of the few tests where we see a
performance loss by enabling gaming mode
and they acknowledge this and noted the
loss as expected is simply because ashes
usually uses those threads and
distributed memory mode this positions
the 1950 X about 4.5 percent behind the
7-yard x not bad given previous results
1920 x isn't far behind and actually
does lose to the 1950 X in this
particular title unlike some of the
others which is again because the extra
cores are actually utilized rather than
just confusing the game natural last
flights another game where we see the
1920 X behind the 1950 X and see those
cores utilize somewhat but you can check
the article below for that game and
others we have a lot more to do with Red
River this is one of the more
interesting products we've worked on the
last few months it has a whole lot of
options for testing and for use cases as
a user so we'll be iterating on this
especially in the thermal department but
for now one thing to get out of the way
first like these 7900 X just like we
said for the 7900 X actually just like
we said for the 1800 X don't buy it for
gaming only if you're only gaming just
to stop and go buy something that's $250
something like that because these aren't
for you
so that stated what these do well on the
gaming side are things that would be
more enthusiasts type tasks like
recording your games while playing them
and encoding that on the CPU rather than
rely on on env encoder or something like
that
if you prefer not to use shadowplay with
enemy encoder other than that we're
looking at benefits primarily in
production workloads blender is really
impressive for thread Ripper it's it's
well ahead the 1950 X actually posts a
good gain over the 1920 X so it's not
just another pointless step to a
processor that is really hard to justify
existence of in this case the 1950 X
Julie has purpose it's doing well it's
20 or so percent ahead the 1920 X but
the 1920 X is still really damn good
if $800 which looking at the this market
and the segment is also pretty damn good
and very competitive and that makes
these two CPUs some of the more exciting
ones that we've looked at recently in
the game streaming side while they do
not offer a noteworthy advantage over
the 1700 X at least with the type of
streaming we tested they do offer a good
value proposition if people look at the
1920 X and we need to do more with that
one on streaming but it's fair to say
where it will fall that's said to
subscribe and check that when we post
that information strictly from the
standpoint of where these CPUs perform
best blender performance its
chart-topping premiere performance
aside from CUDA acceleration its
chart-topping and you can still use that
we finally found some applications that
will use the extra cores without just
CUDA accelerating beyond the the
usefulness of those extra cores and then
for other things like streaming it's
good it's just not it's not special but
it's good and not special strictly
because the 70 I know tax also is fine
for those applications because turns out
streaming while gaming
although intensive is still not enough
to these CPUs to really start crumbling
you need to do other stuff in the
background maybe if you did streaming
while gaming and while rendering
something in blender then you start to
see differences we also start departing
from real-world use cases at that point
but if that's you sort of looks good for
it we didn't talk about gaming
performance too much in this video it
wasn't really the focus we're more
interested in streaming wild gaming or
productivity but here's the thing if you
are doing a lot of gaming it is your
primary task be careful because it may
be the case that something like an r7
1700 or an overclocked variant is a
better buy for you because this CPU the
90s at the ice tiny 20x they do have
problems with games it may be the case
that the games don't launch a lot of the
ones we've tested we just see lower
performance scaling overall than with
Rison 7 for example because the games
don't understand what they're looking at
and something like Rison 7 is
more acceptable to them things are built
for them a little bit better so be aware
of that that's not to say that the cpu
is bad in any way it's just that if you
are doing something like for example
streaming to a single service so it's a
low workload stream relatively you're
streaming to one service and you're
playing games
Rison 7 is going to be a better buy for
you if you're streaming to multiple
services capturing live or using the
more intensive encoding options then
thread Ripper should be a bigger
consideration but until that point
rising 7 makes more sense unless you're
doing other things like blender or
premiere work or any kind of CPU crunch
where the CPU will be pegged to a
hundred percent those are the cases
where threaded four makes sense but if
you are primarily a gamer even one who
streams just go to the article linked
below look at the gaming results and
consider that maybe horizon 7 see if you
would be a better buy for you because
the performance can actually be superior
due to the optimizations and other
issues with thread rippers unique
features that make it so good at
production so all that said the 700x is
still a good CPU it's gotten a bad rap
because x-29 was frankly rushed until
pulled and launched quite a lot and that
hurt their launch it's still a good CPU
and it's just being challenged now so
thread Ripper is a good launch we can
give to AMD that they really ironed out
the difficulties with Rison wouldn't
rise and launched it was a complete mess
behind the scenes leading up to the
review the communication internally at
Andy was bad the communication with
vendors from we heard it was bad and the
motherboard support at launch was mixed
now with that several months behind us
they've worked to really fix all that
so thread Ripper has rolled in all of
these fixes and all these really painful
learning points for AMD into a platform
that finally is actually pretty stable
so we obviously haven't tested
everything possible for thread Ripper
but from what we've tested with this
platform and the CPUs we have we really
didn't run on to any stability issues
that would cause me to say I'm afraid of
you
this in a real environment whereas
previously there's like okay these these
are kind of pretty good in some use
cases but the memory concerns are a
little worrying the crashing or whatever
is a little worrying things like that
they've all been pretty much ironed out
now as you've seen in our coverage of
the last few months so a thread Ripper
we can handle II give the winning award
I suppose over the 700 X and a lot of
those applications and it's a good buy
that said not everyone should buy it
just remember like what you're doing
with the PC and advise something
appropriate for that the r5 1600 X is
good and the cheaper and the i7 7700 K
is good in the higher end of gaming
