we were a more successful and
significantly larger outlet then we
would probably do things like clickbait
titles an example would be our hard
drive companies lying to you I think
that's what we're talking about today
but not quite that extreme because the
answer to that is mostly no marketing is
always kind of blind but what are you
going to do so the question here is from
zero on the discord chat for our patreon
backers you said what's the difference
between a gigabytes and a gig 8 bytes
which I think you meant to give a byte
and why does Windows represent them
incorrectly so we're going to go into
that today before we get into that this
coverage is brought to you by
Thermaltake and their contact silence 12
air cooler it's about a twenty five
dollar cooler competes with be hyper 212
but is newer finally and has an for
mounting support so get into the content
I'm joined by Patrick stone hey who just
spent the last bit doing some numbers
for this video I like budging numbers
yeah it's very fun baby so what I guess
the we can do a short answer well let's
let but explain the question first sure
right so what is what's your
interpretation on this question so what
I'm hearing is the person wants to know
hey I've seen these two different
representations of what they believe is
a storage measurement what do they mean
right so we're going to try to break
that down for you guys yeah so in
Windows give you an example if you go by
a one terabyte hard drive today and you
plug it in as many of you know I'm sure
it will show up as 931 gigabyte right
which where did that number come from
not the same yeah so with SSDs if you're
not familiar s what these are a bit
different than what we're talking today
with an SSD you might have
over-provisioning a place not to be
confused with what we're talking about
here right so you buy a 256 gigabyte SSD
maybe it shows up as 240 that's
generally over-provisioning they tend to
be about seven percent not talking about
that so then the short answer to this 1
terabyte verse 931 gigabytes it's
because of using decimal verses binary
unit
so yeah for measuring the hard drive
capacity different numbering system is
to represent the data which is not very
consistent oh yeah useful for the user
right so do you want to want to dive
into a what decimal and binary are in
this context yeah absolutely yeah so
decimal just means base 10 deci yeah
this is usually associated with 10 and
so base 10 means you got 10 to whatever
power so like 10 to the first power is
just going to be you know 10 10 to the 0
power is going to be 1 and tend to the
biskits like let's say 10 to the third
power is a thousand which they're going
to say is a kilo and then binary is a
little different their binary means base
2 so you got two to whatever power 2 to
the 1 is going to be 2 2 to the 0 is
going to be 1 but then if you look at 2
to the 10th power
that's 1,024 and here's where the
confusion comes in are we talking about
1,024 are always talking about 1,000
right what you need a measurement we
deal with and that's where the decimal
verses binary confusion comes in so we
can figure it out right so drives the
hard drives are advertised as using
decimal format generally 1 terabyte
let's say a decimal format number 500
gigabytes 2 terabytes right there easy
to say I like that a windows uses a
binary format which do we know
explicitly why that is uh no we don't
know why when it was actually Microsoft
what's going on ah sure there's an
actual reason but let's go through some
of the two different sort of
organizations here si Emily and it's
what was the other one yeah so si and
then I you see and really that the
problem is that there are just so many
different standards organizations and
each of them decides hey let's do it
this way that there is an agreed-upon
rule and basically the idea is if it's
data measurement we're going to try and
use base 2 stuff however the hard drive
manufacturers have decided let's not do
that and so we're not sure exactly
that is if we could get the hold of like
Seagate or what's the digital realm I
think they can answer that for us right
because that would kind of make the
world easier and a better place to live
in but you know hey solving global
crises partying with binary versus
decimal how far we have fallen right so
difference of hard drive vendors and
windows basically is the short answer
this yeah we go into a longer answer I
think we should probably define more
units first you may have seen MIB gid as
a unit of measurement yeah not me right
please the AI is important here it's not
just it's not just like a different
spelling of MB or GB yeah exactly so if
you're looking at MIB that's maybe bit
if you're looking at GID that's Gabi
Gabi or Gibby Gibby Gibby there you go
yeah pronunciations right but the point
is if you have that little the lowercase
I in between a capital M and a capital B
or a capital G and a capital B that
little lowercase I that means you're
dealing with the binary system not a
decimal system if you have the capital m
and the capital B or the capital G and
the capital B you might be dealing with
binary you might be dealing with decibel
depends upon what you're looking at but
the thing that you can depend upon is if
you feed a little I hit a little I then
it's a binary system binary standard
numbering right so one give it bite and
it's funny as it sounds the real
measurement one give a byte is equal to
one
binary gigabyte yeah that's right yeah
okay yeah right
and then or I guess 1024 megabytes right
there you go binary gigabytes 1024 mega
mega bytes excuse me yeah yeah yeah so
if you're going to start saying the the
AI measurements then you got to stick
with the admin right so yeah
1024 gigabytes you guys head yet
basically it roughly comes down to one
binary gigabyte is equal to 1024
megabytes
is equal to roughly ten seventy four
megabytes the unit that were generally
familiar with that sounds about right
that sounds about right
Thanks it does the math before we do the
video I'll just double check okay so
let's let's run through it let's use a
500 gigabyte Drive as an example and
just do some calculations here you want
to take it away yeah so we'll put some
stuff down here on the page for you so
that it makes more sense and we'll go
from there so it's like this right so
let's say you're looking at you go to
the store and you buy a 500 gigabyte
Drive right so you're looking at 500
gigabytes right and this is what it says
on the drive it just says 500 gigabytes
so then you're like wait a minute
why does my windows show that I have 465
gigabytes
all of a sudden and the truth is you
need to do some unit conversion like you
don't want gigabytes you want to find
out what it is and give the bytes so
here comes some unit conversion for you
guys okay so if I don't want gigabytes I
got to figure out how to get rid of
gigabytes so I know that one gigabyte is
the same thing as one mil 1 billion 1
billion bytes so that's 10 to the 9th
okay 10 to the 9th bytes so that looks
like this right here okay and what's
going to happen is this gigabyte right
here that guy is going to cross that
with that guy right there so now we got
bytes which is that's good
which is good that's good nice yeah so
now but bytes is not quite what I want I
want I want give it legs
so now I'm going to say okay well how
can I go from bytes to give advice well
that's pretty simple I know that 2 to
the 30th power and you can look this up
on tables like not hard to find 2 to the
30th power bytes is 1 gibibyte GI b so
it looks like this right here 2 to the
30th power bytes is 1 gibibyte and look
at what happens here now so I got some
more unit cancellation I got BAM that
guy's gone go away this guy's going go
away and now I'm left with only thing
over here
this guy right here that's beautiful I
sort of want baby bytes right there okay
so just doing the math here now we're
going to do 500 times a billion divided
by 2 to the 30th which is a big number
so we're going to punch it on the
calculator here just got 500 we're going
to times that by a billion or 10 to the
9th and then divide that by 2 raised to
the 30th power and Steve's doing some
Google masses yeah Google's a wonderful
thing how my hat yeah I did 4 so we got
a funny-looking number right 465 dot and
then a big decimal that actually is
significant all those points we found
out so it's dot six six one two eight
seven three zero eight if you care and
I'm watching it what is the significance
of that number that looks like what we
see in window exactly so now you're
seeing when windows reports you got four
hundred sixty five gigabytes what they
actually mean it's four to sixty five
gigabytes right and four to six without
gigabyte gigabytes is the same thing as
a drive manufacturers advertised 500
gigabytes so we're just showing you guys
the relationship and even though it
appears to be confusing the math does
work out you can prove it mathematically
and so when you see windows advertise
465 Gibby bites actually windows says
four to six out of gigabytes it actually
does mean five hundred billion bytes
right all right and so we just want you
guys to know that if you're paying for
five hundred billion bytes you're
getting five hundred billion bytes
yeah the the bytes are there it doesn't
vanish it's not like they're just
rounding up they exist true except the
how is it calculated what unit are you
using to get the number 500 gigabytes
versus windows which I think windows
rounds down as well yeah we found out
well yeah and we were thinking about
like what why is it that way and the
only thing we got with was okay well if
you paid for something like let's say
you paid for four hundred sixty six
gigabytes but then you only got 460
you'd be kind of upset but if you pay
for 465 and then got for sixty five
point six be like hey it's got a pre for
six yeah
so there you go yeah and also also if
you if you really like trying to dig
down into this stuff if you go into
Windows Explorer and you right-click on
your drive the one that says 465
gigabytes
if you look at the properties to drop
you should see five hundred billion
bytes available so guys how it works
right yeah yeah maybe would you like a
little screen cap and you'll see that
who knows we'll see yeah
yeah and it gets a bit more extreme too
of course as you go up in size so one
terabyte it looks a lot worse now you're
losing about 70 gigabytes and losing of
course air quotes there yeah as we've
just explained so you know two terabytes
looks even worse so so that's why that
happens I know it's kind of a basic
topic in terms of not something that
impacts your daily builds or anything
but it's an interesting one and I think
this puts some of the numbers behind it
but yeah everyone can visualize it
better yeah definitely yeah I reckon you
know rest assured you're not being
cheated everyone should know about you
mark yeah mate okay maybe everyone is
out to get you we're paid by a big hard
drive company one to tell you sit where
she'll love the remaining hard drive
vendors as they desperately fight off
the SSD this is getting very dark thank
you for watching as always subscribe for
more patreon.com/scishow on helps out
directly S at the end of that gamers
Nexus and this question came from a
discord user we have a discord chat
there which you get access to you once
you back is on patreon
thank you zero for the question we'll
see you next time
okay hey what do you guys think about
the view of like looking at the camera
versus just looking at the person</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
