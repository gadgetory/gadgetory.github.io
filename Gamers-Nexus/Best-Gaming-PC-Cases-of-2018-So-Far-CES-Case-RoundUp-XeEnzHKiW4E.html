about air flow in cases and it seems
that some manufacturers have heard our
complaints for 2018 it's time to round
up the best of show for CES 2018
focusing primarily on the case is
revealed at this year's event we saw
plenty of enclosures that belong innate
needs work category but there were also
innovators for the year options from
Lian Li coolermaster silver stone and
even enter Mac's are all worth talking
about but they weren't alone in the CES
showcase some of the unit's on display
managed to bring an airflow back while
others makes the better air flow
ventilation alongside the tempered glass
obsession and some did no airflow at all
we'll get through all of those and more
in this best cases of CES 2018 roundup
before that this video is brought to you
by thermal grizzly makers of the
conductor not liquid metal that we
recently used to drop 20 degrees off of
our temperatures thermal grizzly also
makes traditional thermal compounds we
use on top of the IHS like cryo not and
hydronaut pastes learn more at the link
below let's open up this coverage with
our best of show overall award this one
easily goes to the LeAnn leo 11 dynamic
and 11 air enclosures built as a
collaborative project between lammle and
overclocking engineered air Bauer the
case makes excellent use of space
without getting too wide the O 11
manages to relocate the power supply
into a separate compartment which frees
up the entire interior for optimized
airflow pathways two core components
moving the PSU to the back of the case
means that the bottom can be configured
with intake fans feeding the GPU
directly and the CPU can be cooled via
liquid or bottom front intake the O 11
air case has a grilled front and top
supporting up to 360 millimeters worth
of fans in each location the radiators
are an alternative and are also
supported in the O 11 dynamic side
mounted radiators and fans can also be
positioned in the case useful for custom
loop machines if that's more your thing
and the O Levin has too many features to
really recap and around a video but to
go over the basics here's what we talked
about at the show the O 11 air is
intended to ship at 120 dollars without
any fans at all or $150 with three front
mounted non LED fans
and three side mounts at RGB LED fans
six total from what we were told by Lian
Li representatives the O 11 dynamic case
will offer 0 fans and acts as the front
grills in favor of tempered glass
jumping up $230 in price the dynamic is
meant for liquid cooling builds and
feeds its intake primarily from the
underside of the chassis Lian Li has
about an inch of breathing room under
the case which our testing has found to
be sufficient for most use cases and
should chart top GPU quillian
performance given the minimal distance
from the GPU and the underside this
keeps air pressure high as well
other features include dual power supply
supports if you wanted it with semi
modularity the choice is between two
power supplies or you could use one of
the power supply slots for hard drives
Lian Li and our bauer focused on
function here and we think this is
easily the most promising case of CES
it's something that manages to keep
visuals in mind while also allowing for
once airflow into the case and it does
so without being massive either as a
quick side mention LAN Lee also showed
the less function focused fusion elite
under their land cool brand which still
has many TBD specifications and
components so we can't go too deep on
this one
the fusion elite should ship at around
$90 and he uses a slightly open front
panel for more intake than a closed-off
front case with a side mounting for more
intake still well look at this in more
detail once we have a review sample
through contacts at the show we found
the cooler master suite and showed up
unannounced to check out the modified
aged 500 P cases this one landed us in
our biggest surprise category because we
were surprised that cooler master led us
in the suite ok maybe not we were
surprised that cooler master a company
which provided resistance to our
criticisms of the H 500 P managed to
turn around such a critical set of
changes in a relatively short amount of
time
despite initial head-butting over our H
500 P review and mesh mod the company is
now upgrading old and new designs
tighten up the front and top panels
reducing risk of the case falling apart
and is also moving to improve air flow
the aged 500 M version of the case
further improves quality by getting the
left side panel flush with the case
something that none of the aged 500 PV
variants
just to do and it's also offering
swappable mesh and glass for the front
panel which should theoretically resolve
many of our concerns with the initial
case launch including air flow and build
quality as for the Aged 500 p refresh
that's now using a screw to hold the top
panel in place which we think is
brilliant if simple and the front panel
is now using a clip to firmly mount it
in quick testing we move to the demo
table more than the front panel when
ripping at it and we also noticed that
the left tempered glass panel is now
more secure rather than wobbling back
and forth the power supply now mounts in
a bracket similar to the 600 C or s ting
40 so you no longer have to remove the
entire power slide shroud to get it in
there and all of these changes will roll
out to the channel so future buyers of
the gray h 500 PE will find these
improvements in that case as the channel
sells out of existing inventory there
are two mesh options for the white case
right now with one including a dust
filter and one without a dust filter
cooler master is still finalizing the
design here the mesh modded version of
the aged 500 P also has slightly
stronger structural integrity in the
front panel because since there's no
glass there they can do a cross bar to
hold the plastic together without that
annoying creaking noise that the
original case made learn more about the
H 500 P and H 500 m and our cooler
master coverage so far it looks like CM
has done a great job at listening to
major criticisms of the case despite
something of a standoff at first
publication moving on to best small
form-factor the N when a one was first
shown at Computex but has been finalized
for sale in 2018 the a one was
originally demonstrated with a wood
panel something that anyone is still
hoping to do but not for the first round
of the case manufacturing process is
still being dialed in for making the
wood panels so for now it's shipping as
you see it here the white and black
options are offered immediately and the
enclosures should ship at around $140
the units include an RGB LED strip
underneath encased in an acrylic side
skirt that slightly obscures to 120
millimeter bottom intake fans another
120 millimeter fan can be installed on
the side with the right panel punctured
for exhaust or intake ventilation we
found the case to be incredibly compact
and of a good look in ones closest
primary competition from this year came
from
per stone who converted their Computex
mini-itx cases into micro ATX cases for
2018 and that brings us to the best
micro ATX category it's almost a shallow
victory for silverstone to take best
micro ATX cases seeing as there was
nearly zero competition this year still
we wanted to take a moment to highlight
the LD 0 1 &amp;amp; LD 0 2 by silverstone which
have been reworked from combi text to a
slightly larger form factor the LD 0 1 &amp;amp;
2 are inverted motherboard orientation
cases with some focus on modularity for
future designs
we're told that future iterations of
these frames might include mesh paneling
as well
despite an immediate forum focused
design silverstone has a few functional
elements like side ventilation on the
paneling and top ventilation alongside a
GPU support structure that mounts to the
side wall and these are accompanied by
odd design choices - like the pipe that
has no real purpose aside from looks and
those are also odd regardless the
inverted layout is one that we think
will do well with future mesh designs
should they ship and the airflow
dynamics of the case should change in
interesting ways with that mesh front
well look at this more in the future
enter Max's Sabre a lands in the most
improves category we see a lot of cases
over two or three trade shows each
receiving small updates to prototypes as
the case keeps going and sometimes they
never even ship but most improved
belongs to a case that has been shown a
few times has changed and still manages
to go out to market the Sabre Ray was
first shown at CES 2017 then at Computex
mid-year and then it vanished at CES
2018 we learned that it's finally
nearing production and the case has been
modified for several key changes that
improve overall quality and value in our
coverage of the new Sabre a we revealed
that the top and front panels are
interchangeable so the mesh and acrylic
options can be swapped or changed to
full mesh enter max plans to ship to
mesh inserts with the case so you'll be
able to structure the enclosure to focus
fully on air flow or if you prefer use
included acrylic to get more looks
oriented enter max further modified its
light pipe to be RGB now rather than
fixed color because you can't stay in
business otherwise and it integrates
synchronization with other LED products
the same array should land at around
$160 and we'll include a few fans in the
final model CRN our max coverage for
more information on this one this one is
the least interesting case and lands in
more of an honorable mention category so
wanted to keep an eye on just not all
that impressive
this was the corsair obsidian 500 d it's
the least interesting strictly because
it's so safe it's a steel and glass box
that has some fans its shaped like other
boxes it mounts components like other
boxes it uses large parts of the
existing 5 70 X 2 lanes so it's not new
tooling and it doesn't necessarily take
any major risks that said sometimes it's
better not to take risks
there's a reason traditional design
exists and it's because it works
coursers primary changes have been to
add the hinged doors lifted from their
own concepts late at Computex but most
of the rest remains standard it's an ATX
tower with some front intake and lots of
space internally that about sums this
one up it's a lateral evolution of the
570 X which isn't necessarily a bad
thing it's just also not that exciting
we didn't see a lot of budget cases this
year so we're giving this budget case
category to the Versa age 26 and the
j-20 to these cases were shown in
thermal takes side room not even really
publicly that known about and they
shipped alongside the age 27 and j 23
the hmj series cases are differentiated
in number primarily by their front panel
the age 26 has a mesh front panel while
the 27 has a closed-off front panel the
same is true for 22 and 23 where the 22
unit has a mesh panel we find both mesh
variants appealing for cheap entry-level
options with tempered glass but we don't
have finalized fan specs and don't know
what they're going to ship with in terms
of cooling either way they're affordable
and land in the budget class and we
think that the mesh options are worth
keeping an eye on design isn't bad
overall so that's a plus but they're
mostly just sort of semi discrete black
boxes with mesh ventilation as a quick
mention while on the topic of thermal
take we also looked at the thermal take
view 37 chassis this one has some
interesting elements like fitment for
200 millimeter fans which will
definitely excite some people but we'll
place this one and our annual needs work
category the view of 37 has a lot of the
same problems at the h5
repeated it's got no mesh on the front
it has limited intake on the sides and
you're basically relying on whatever
pressure you can to get air into the
chassis there were a lot more cases at
the show and we didn't spend hands-on
time with every single one this is the
everything house category we didn't get
much time to check them out but
coolermaster also had the Q 300 P small
form-factor case once again enclosed in
glass and also had the MC 600 pro for
$130 marked down from 160 and the MC 500
maker for 170 marked down from 200 more
on these later maybe from thermal take
the company also had a view 91 enclosure
basically a larger server sized variant
of the view 71 complete with a three to
four foot wide hinged door and a fish
tank like accommodations internally it's
definitely a looker but it's also
gigantic and expensive Silverstone had
finalized versions of the red line no.7
which pivots in a huge way from the
chart leading our l06 from last year the
red lines your seven sticks with more
closed off front paneling and has more
of an artsy look about it it was first
shown at Computex but now has been
finalized the company also had its PMO
too still somewhat ventilated but not as
much as the PMO one Silverstone is
beginning to pivot towards the closed
front design feeling an industry
pressure from nearly every other
manufacturer separately Silver's don't
have the CS 381 which we might have a
project for later it's a micro ITX
server box I can fit eight hard drives
with an additional two hard drives
mountable if we remove fans fantex had
as p300 special edition cases but the
closed off ventilation leaves a lot to
be desired and it's also a trend with
the company since the P 400 the 350 X is
a bit more interesting from fan tags but
still relatively closed off in the least
it has some side match on the front
panel but you're still fighting the
90-degree turns and reduced air pressure
on the intake the bigger focus here is
on RGB LEDs primarily a strip between
the tempered glass and the power supply
deep cool meanwhile showed its baron
case and quad stellar again for the
third or fourth time so nothing new from
them these cases are ones that we've
seen for over a year now just with RGB
variants included and Corsair had a spec
Omega that we didn't feel fitting enough
to make it into any award
korie's as primarily a spec alpha phase
with a 460 X chassis $100 price point
that said it may interest some of you so
we wanted to point it out once again and
