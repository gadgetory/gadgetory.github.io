we have sort of challenged since we
first saw it at Computex we assigned to
this case the award of something along
the lines of needs work maybe not as
much of a hoard as the others but we
said it needed work we liked a lot of
things about the case at the time it was
pitched to us as 60 to 70 US dollars for
tempered glass on the side and
addressable RGB LEDs on the front at 60
to 70 dollars that's absurdly
competitive but we had a problem with it
we said to the BitFenix folks do you
have air flow and they said don't worry
we'll fix that for launch so here we are
launched before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by EVGA and
on video with the destiny to 1080 TI
bundle a 1080i SC to comes with a
synchronous fan control for its dual
fans and nine thermal sensors and again
includes destiny to learn more at the
link in the description below so the
conversation that comedy zags basically
went something along the lines of this
is great 60 to 70 dollars for
addressable RGB LEDs tempered glass you
get all the trends in your cheaper than
everyone else at the time and it looks
not bad either
so the problem was we basically said you
need some ventilation somewhere in the
case because if you look at this case
I'm not talking h 500 P here I'm talking
like straight straight up hotbox the
front panel does not have ventilation at
all zero it's got RGB LEDs in it
now where would you then go to resolve
this you would put ventilation on the
side of the front panel you might put
ventilation on the top and then move
back your i/o you could put bigger
ventilation on the very bottom down here
you'll notice that this panel extends to
the table and the only place there's
ventilation literally using that word in
the most literal sense the literal only
place there
ventilation is there that's where it
gets air I can't even see it from where
I'm standing
that's the ventilation for the case now
this is all without even mentioning the
fact that the price has gone up it's now
I think $90 I think it's gone up to 90
so it's no longer 60 to 70 yeah you had
$60 I probably ignore that and say you
know what for a cheap case maybe you buy
it you buy another fan with it
offset the cost is offset any way by the
cheapness of the case and no big deal we
we deal with it you can cut a hole
somewhere and that's it at $90 that
stuff should be done for you so yeah
that's what we're dealing with here
today the case still does the RGB LED
stuff still has a tempered glass the
price is higher the ventilation is still
non-existent but Phoenix did not follow
through with what they told me they
would do and you've got some stuff like
this thing just just to add insult to
injury you know so once again
ventilations on the bottom front of that
there's a single fan in the front middle
here there's another fan in the back
rear and then there's top just sort of
mesh ventilation whatever with no fans
on it so you get sort of passive wafting
of air through there or you could put
this on it and just turn your computer
into a toaster which we actually tested
this thing versus this one and if you
buy this case do not use this it has a
significant impact in some scenarios so
yeah there are ways to make this case
work a lot better than it does stock and
we've tested them and found them and
there's hope yet if you really want it
you can make it work just you need to be
aware that you basically have to buy a
fan or relocate the fans in here because
they've done a very poor job on anything
to do with air so yeah let's let's go
through some of it features RGB
addressable has aura sync
it's compatible with basically
everything and they've got the strips
that terminate and the four plug end
that you can plug into other strips if
you wanted to super Universal on LED
compatibility it has dust filters that
come out of the sides which is much
appreciated this coming out of the back
from the power supply makes very little
sense from an ease of use standpoint so
doing it like BitFenix is doing here is
a great move and that's something
they've done well it'd be nice if they
had thought through some of the other
stuff that well I mean even though you
look at the bottom and the feet are so
long that even the inch on the bottom
where air can kind of get in and out
it's kind of blocked off there two
filters exists on the front this one is
what is in front of the only fan in the
case funny thing about dust filters in
order to collect dust there needs dust
test like actually go through it so this
is in front of a fan which has no front
access to air and that fan is in the
center of the case right there
pulling air from remind me down here so
it's this fan which is not not a special
static pressure optimized fan or
anything is pulling air from way down
here all the way down here and trying to
get it up here it's got a filter that
the air will presumably go through at
some point and you know what ended up
happening is as we'll talk about in a
moment is the fan ends up recirculating
more heat from all of this that sort of
drafts forward it recirculates that more
so than pulling clean cool air in and
then you've got there's this filter down
here which isn't in front of a fan that
I'm stalling there that you could and it
would help with GPU thermals there is no
filter up here in front of this top
option which is kind of curious because
they've already got the other two
there's a spot there for a fan but to be
fair it's almost like admitting that
there's no point in putting a fan here
but then putting the mounts there anyway
so you can take the box on this back
sheet so you put a fan there that fan if
you install a fan here it is now pulling
air more than a foot from the bottom of
the case so you've got air that's coming
in here doing a 90 degree turn losing
30% of its pressure just turning and
then it's getting pulled by two fans
that are installed serially and if any
air gets past the first one and up here
it does its next 90 degree turn and
comes into the case so why did Phoenix
come on man we talked about there's like
six months ago numerous times even let's
let's go over the rest of the features
of the case I'm gonna read some of the
stuff that Patrick wrote for the review
he did the most building in it so he's
got the most notes on the rest of this
and then we'll go through the thermals
and noise and everything else so our
review sample is nearly pure white
obviously it includes filters and PCIe
covers it's got four LED strips that
form a ring on the front panel matched
by an RGB fan and the rear LEDs are
connected to a tiny but admittedly
versatile controller behind the
motherboard with a few baked in colors
and rainbow patterns the rear fan is
translucent and fully changes colors
with different lighting but it's most
effective with static colors like
rippling rainbow effects work better on
the front panel for instance adapters
are also included so that the controller
can be bypassed and all LEDs can be
controlled with standard four pin RGB
cables or you go into the motherboard
overall the RGB illumination is handled
better and seems much less tacked on
that it did in the BitFenix Shogun but
again the case has new problems to
battle the front panel is a mess of
filters LEDs or wires plastic
reinforcements and steel it's
surprisingly heavy for an otherwise
lightweight case and the front panel is
certainly sturdy it borders on overbuilt
even there's even a thick reinforcing
the frame of plastic behind the steel
for really not much reason it as of now
but the tooling could be reused and the
front panel looks like it's had a lot of
design work and money put into it but
somehow nobody thought to put a vent in
it or
cut a hole somewhere on the sides where
most people do we'll elaborate more on
that in the thermal section though the
exterior is simple and symmetrical with
the exception of three filter handles
jutting out from the sides and to be
incredibly nitpicky the front IO ports
aren't quite in a straight line so
they'll fit the curve of the front panel
for example would be ideal and the power
and hard drive LEDs don't completely
line up with their respective holes the
top of the case can optionally be
covered with that magnetic mesh filter
or solid cover already shown similar to
the defined see but the cover isn't
precisely color matched and the filter
looks better it also works better these
are minor points on an otherwise good
looking case externally and it's clear
that BitFenix really put some effort
into making the various fittings all
white that we used to except for the
grommets that again no effort into
anything regarding cooling there's no
special hinge or mechanism holding the
glass on just four screws at the corners
as expected for a budget case or what
was supposed to be about the case our
glass was slightly chipped at one corner
but that could probably be blamed partly
on shipping in the very least installing
the motherboard was easy enough but the
power supply presented some difficulties
the Enzo is a 3.5 inch drive cage is an
increasingly common style it hides
beneath the front of the power supply
shroud it fits two drives and it can be
moved forward for additional power
supply cable clearance or taken out or
well it could be if it weren't riveted
into place the screw holes for shifting
the cage forward are still there but the
cage itself is permanently stuck in a
position that bent our power supply
cables sharply enough to require
disconnecting them and then reconnecting
that once the power supply was installed
in the case and anyone here who's done
that before it knows just how fun it is
the small cutouts in the shroud are a
poorly placed to provide any relief for
this and a large cutout at the front is
permanently open without the removable
cover seen in other cases like the
defined C or some of Silverstone's cases
the power supply has to be inserted from
the side not the back which is somewhat
common but because of the hard drive
positioning it made the cages placement
even more and can be
if Phoenix hasn't already they
undoubtedly have plans to use the
chassis as the basis for more enclosures
in the future which is perfectly fine
and normal but it's frustrating to see
evidence of missing features like this
kala man's rental was acceptable outside
of the shroud but there sure are a lot
of cables to manage the RGB controller
is small but it has a confusing array of
adapters plugged into it
despite being connected to just two
items but it does a good job of ensuring
that everyone who uses this case will be
able to make use of the RGB features in
some capacity moving into the thermal
section again you can check the article
linked to the description below for the
full testing methodology and all the
other information we put the ENSO na
needs a work category when we saw it at
Computex this year specifically because
it will act front intake well they've
added a fan so it's got front something
but it's not taking air in from the
outside it's taking air in a little bit
from the bottom air is intended to flow
between the front legs of the case up
through the front panel about several
inches anyway or one full foot if you
install the fan at the top and then
there's theoretical possibility of
adding additional 120 many fans above
and below the center one though they
would all be installed somewhat serially
in a line the filter only partially
covers the intake path once again and we
criticize the H 500 P pretty heavily for
some of the same reasons that we're now
criticizing the answer or but it did at
least have some mass over each of the
intended intake vents and had some kind
of breathability there more so than this
thing does and that included a little
mesh apron under the H 500 PE that was
added post Computex to resolve some dust
concerns the answer doesn't even get
that far one potential problem with the
stock configuration is that it's easier
for the intake fan to pull hot air from
the inside of the case than the poll
cool air from the outside there are big
empty fan Bay's immediately above and
below it
while the quote real vent is relatively
small and far away and partially
obstructed by superfluous and lower
filters the filters and their slots are
completely removable but doing so leaves
holes in the case normally the solution
to these problems would be put more fans
in but the top slot has no filter for
additional tests this time we tried five
different ways
forcing some air into the Enzo with the
stock configuration we tried with the
front panel off as usual we tried with
the top fan base sealed and the top and
bottom fan base sealed simultaneously
and then we tried adding an additional
120 millimeter intake fans first in the
front of the case then in the top front
of the case and we also finally tested
in the stock configuration with the
solid cover on top of the case than the
magnetic mesh filter in all the other
tests this testing we're starting with
the torture testing initiates only with
the end so we'll add comparative data in
a moment our standard torture test
raised the CPU to 64 point two degrees
above ambient with the CPU temperature
peaking 10 degree Celsius away from
t.j.maxx so 90 degrees if you're getting
rid of the whole delta T over ambient
pain
CPU temperature usually doesn't matter
much in our testing but it does here
putting the non mesh cover on top of the
case cause the CPU to hit TJ max 100
degrees Celsius during peak load and
begin throttling which is certainly an
achievement in its own right and the
pure base 600 another warm case that we
tested opening the top vent didn't
contribute much to CV cooling as the air
actively blows from front to back with
the end so the heat builds up so much in
the case that it can be felt rising
passively from the CPU cooler and just
sort of naturally drafting out of the
top vent the solid cover resulted in a
71 point 1 degree final score so to
speak but that would have continued to
climb had throttling not occurred taking
the front panel completely off
dramatically swung the results in the
other direction with one of the largest
temperature drops we've seen so far we
went down fourteen point one degree is
from stock to fifty point one to Crees
Celsius over ambient we tried to claw
back some of that fourteen point one
degree gap with the front panel actually
installed first by sealing the fan bays
and then by adding fat sealing the top
bay caused no improvement and may have
made air less available to the intake
fan recycling hot air though is still
better than nothing sealing both empty
fan bays didn't hurt performance but
improvement still wasn't outside of
range of variants even adding a 120
millimeter not
to a fan to the front pointed directly
at the heatsink no less normally a
surefire way of dropping see
temperatures score at a paltry 2.5
degrees lower than stock temperature
that's because it simply cannot breathe
there's zero air access in that top slot
the only truly effective configuration
we tested was adding an intake fan to
the top of the case pointing downwards
which scored 51 point 8 degrees Celsius
over ambient just slightly warmer than
removing the front panel and if nothing
else CPU thermals benefit tremendously
from top intake with this case like
we've said before heat may rise but cold
air can pretty much go wherever you want
when you blast it through a fan
comparatively despite all that talk
about the answers front panel it's still
not the worst case for CPU temperatures
that we've tested the n1 805 infinity
Corsair speck of four and be quiet pure
bass 638 G 21 all I had pretty poor CPU
cooling and higher deltas as well the
tragedy of the end so however is that it
really can't be improved that well not
even by sticking extra fans into the
front of it top intake does fix the CPU
temperature is actually impressively and
that puts it in the coarser 570 X range
but that only really benefits the CPU we
need to check the GPU section next to
see if there's any negative impact from
pushing that warmed air into the GPU
backside with the answer only on the
screen now GPU delta T over ambient was
61 point nine degrees stock warm enough
to lock the clock speed down to 1708
megahertz with another dramatic drop
from the front panel removal 10.1
degrees this time again any positive
effects from taping off the fan bays
were cancelled out by the lower overall
volume of air moves even if it was
warmer air and the oddest result was the
GPU temperature with an additional front
fan instead of lowering the GPU
temperature went up several degrees to
67.7 and if you think about it this
isn't impossible the extra fan changed
the air flow pattern enough that it
negatively affected the GPU this was
repeatable and verified with other log
data and adding a fan to the top of the
case had even less effect on the GPU
than taping the fan base resulting in
functionally the same GPU temperature as
the stock configure a
so we're still locked down to 1708
megahertz again we've tested worse cases
with stock deltas but even the antec p8
looking at comparative data now was
capable of showing improvement with
extra fans the answer doesn't have this
Headroom and as a result it's stuck
performing little better than these
stock course respect Oh for a GPU
cooling especially and that's a case
that came with only one fan and retails
for $50 both cases try to use a single
intake fan to direct airflow at the GPU
and also above it to the CPU and both
fail GPU temperature during looping up
fire strike extreme tests had it at
fifty nine point eight degrees Celsius
just above the spec oh four and again on
par with other mediocre results like the
define see the stock match fic without
the extra fans and the anti p8 all of
these have shrouds limiting airflow at
the bottom of the case and increasing
GPU temperatures this is a real world
gaming workload and temperatures this
high can definitely cause dropped clock
speeds on the GPUs adding ambient back
in gets us to around 82 degrees Celsius
or throttle points on Pascal cards and
you can solve for this technically you
could configure a custom fan curve on
the GPU increase it to maybe 60 70
percent something like that and you
basically end up a little bit below
throttle point it's not the best
solution because then you increase your
noise and that was BitFenix as argument
for this close off front panel and we
asked about it so not really ideal but
it can be done our blender test is a
realistic production workload that
avoids some of the potential pitfalls of
torture tests like runaway thermals were
throttling to stay under 100 C in this
scenario the M says forty two point two
degrees Celsius Nelson C over ambient is
right between the anti pH and Coursera
spec for GPU temperature and blender
testing was actually below the PA and
effectively tied with a defined C but
still at the high end of the scale
without the heat caused by an intense
workload like firm article firestrike
GPU clock speed remained to just under
2,000 megahertz for the duration of the
render proving just how much you lose
when doing anything like gaming where we
were dropping to 1700 megahertz or so
the Enzo isn't the noise suppressing
case by any means but it's noise output
is just about average the one
benefit of completely sealing the front
panel as that very little sound reaches
our DB meter 35.9 DBA is a coolant to
the Shogun or ROS well : n'
both of which have three 120 millimeter
stock fans cool better and have the same
noise level put in the magnetic cover on
the top of the case instead of the
breathable filter it causes only
imperceptible improvement and we'd
recommend against doing it at all we've
had concerns about the answer for as
long as we've been aware of it we've
made those concerns very clear since the
beginning and we're told even at
Computex that it wasn't the final
version and that the final version would
have better ventilation we were also
told that it would be something like
twenty to thirty dollars cheaper than it
is so this is another story of a case
that shipped at a higher price than it
was ever meant to and it's paying for
that obviously the case also even
competing against bit Phoenix's own
options the portal looks pretty good it
has some thermal concerns but it is a
good looking case the Shogun is visually
polarizing but does have pretty decent
thermals and acoustics so BitFenix knows
how to make a case that performs well
the Aurora case doesn't look bad either
so we look forward to seeing BitFenix
apply some of this knowledge and
experience they obviously have to a case
like this a budget case but for now if
you're looking for something in a
similar price range that's way better
we'd recommend the mesh if I see as a
tempered glass alternative it's not as
flashy it doesn't have the RGB LEDs so
if you want those things then probably
look elsewhere but ideally look
elsewhere other than this and maybe just
buy the RGB LED strip separately or
something like that otherwise buy this
thing and make sure you buy an extra fan
for it in your configuration set the fan
of stop intake that'll help the CPU for
the GPU set the fan curve such that it
exceeds the stock curve most stock
bankers for GPUs top out at around 55
percent you'll want to go past that and
make sure the GPU is staying under ATC
now Pascal different content really here
but Pascal
performs the best under 6dc but good
luck getting that in this case at all so
that's it for this one
