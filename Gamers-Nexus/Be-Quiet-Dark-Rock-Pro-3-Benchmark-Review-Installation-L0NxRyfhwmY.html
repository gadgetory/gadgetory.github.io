Nexus Donette and today we are looking
at be quiet dark rock pro 3 and this
cooler was shipped to us by be quiet the
german-based cpu cooler and power supply
company they wanted us to look at it it
is the most monolithic imposing cooler
for a CPU that I have ever seen it is it
is quite the masterpiece here a true
work of art that perhaps Batman himself
would install on his CPU and this color
will run through the specs first and
then look at the benchmark performance
it is about $110 106 210 pretty damn
expensive but it is a high-end air
cooler which we often say will
outperform low and liquid coolers so
this is a a test of that statement the
cooler is compatible with effectively
all Intel CPUs from 775 sockets onward
up to 2011 and it is compatible with AMD
from way back to 750 for all the way up
to FM 2 plus so it will work on
basically everything the unit ships with
two fans one is internal in between a
dual aluminum tower cooling rig and the
internal fan is 135 millimeters and the
external fan is 120 millimeters that is
the one that pushes that that pulls the
air into the unit and then the middle
fan pushes it out the back so that's our
fan setup they are connected Foley with
PWM and actually will connect to each
other through a daisy chain so that you
can only use one CPU cooler slot on the
board which is a nice consideration by
be quiet the unit is rated for 13.2
decibels at 50% of the RPM and it goes
up to 20 6.1 decibels at 100% rpm and
the RPM range is 1400 to 1,700 for both
fans they use a fluid dynamic bearing
meaning that it is rated for a higher
lifespan it will get a bit Y near when
when you first use the unit but that
whine dies down pretty quickly as the
bearings are burned in in their first
cycle the lifespan is rated at 300,000
hours at 25 Celsius that you're going to
get a little bit of degradation with the
heat consideration but that's that it's
still pretty pretty high all of that
noted we can then look
at the actual aluminum and copper
components the cold plate of the CPU
cooler is a mirror finish it's very
shiny in fact scarily shiny because you
will see yourself in the mirror and that
is made out of a copper base plate this
is connected to seven heat pipes at six
millimeters in diameter making this
cooler the largest cooler we've ever
tested on the bench and seven heat pipes
is a damn lot of heat pipes now you
might be wondering why they don't do
fewer heat pipes at eight millimeters
versus more at six having more heat
pipes like this will actually give the
unit a better performance potential with
larger CPUs like the 2011 socket that
take up a physically larger square area
you do lose some of that performance
when testing with things like the 1150
and 1155 series like we have done here
because the CPU won't won't fully
saturate that cold plate the cooler is
physically very large this is 150 by 137
by 163 millimeters which means it will
have limited compatibility on smaller
cases as a lot of these smaller cases
are limited to 160 millimeter height of
coolers looking at installation before
benchmarks installation on this unit is
one of the most painful processes I've
ever had the misfortune of running into
with a CPU cooler in fact it the
instructions aren't 100% clear what you
should do if you buy this is separately
prepare the CPU cooler before placing it
onto the board what I mean by this is
you mount your backplate to the
motherboard you snap the screws into
place with these plastic snaps that are
included so they won't slip out and then
you mount the rest of the components to
the cooler and then you mount your
motherboard to the CPU cooler that
sounds a bit backwards but it's the best
way to do it in this instance and you
can see it in the video I'm showing here
so that's sort of the best way to go
about this if you don't do it this way
and you try to mount the CPU cooler and
then screw on the nut that holds the
bolts into place you are going to be one
busting your knuckles on copper and he's
spending an hour doing it and probably
will have a somewhat bent board at the
end because it's very difficult to
properly adjust the corner screw because
of the heatsink placement on the
motherboard for the
erm heatsinks so do keep that in mind
not so bad if you do it the way I
explained you should probably do it with
the board hanging over a table or
something like that to make your life a
bit easier or get a hand model with
small hands to do everything for you
because those are abundant as we all
know looking at the benchmark results
all the test methodology is in the
article linked in the description below
please click on that and read through
the article for more details on this it
and and also to see the test methodology
so stock performance this cooler just
kind of jumping straight into it hands
down takes the first place best of bench
award for air coolers on our bench it is
beaten out strictly by closed-loop
liquid coolers including the likes of
the ex 40 on extreme settings it
actually beats the ex 40 on silent and
the ex 60 on silent extreme the H 9 th
110 and an Tex 1250 which is on the next
chart that I'll be showing the be quiet
dark rock pro 3 is a forty nine Celsius
stable temperature ranking just above
our previous best of bench silverstone
are gone ar zero one with two fans at
forty nine point two or one fan at fifty
point six Celsius using the aftermarket
compound which is much better in my
opinion the controlled compound produces
a forty nine point nine seven Celsius
load temperature which means it is just
slightly above the argon AR 0 one again
and blow antics 1250 on silent settings
two things to note here
one the compound that ships with the
dark rock pro three is very runny it's
kind of liquidy and because of the very
painful installation process that means
it's going to get all over the place
where you don't want it when you're
installing the unit and it's not gonna
be a perfect install I actually had to
do this three times to make sure I had
the the thermal paste the way I liked it
I would recommend getting something like
what I use for control which is an antic
silver something or other or Arctic
silver is also very good because those
are going to be more solid and they'll
stay in place better second things note
this unit is very expensive it's $110
that places it at the same price
actually more than an TX 1250 which is
our current best of bench for everything
in terms of CPU coolers and it places it
a little bit under the new NZXT ex 61
and a little under the
XTX 60 and just above the X 40 so why
then would you want to buy
be quiet Stark Rock pro three well it's
it's really three things it's for
silence it's for aesthetics and it's for
endurance in terms of silence I don't
have an objective decibel test for you
unfortunately but subjectively it is
quieter than all the other air coolers
on the bench and it is quieter than all
of the liquid coolers when they are on
extreme settings and some of them when
they're on custom settings the dark rack
pro 3 is about tied with the Antec 1250
on silent and x 14 x 60 on silent but
it's going to be quieter than the
Corsair h 110 and h 90 for sure by
actually a longshot beyond that the
aesthetics you're paying for a very cool
look it's a big cooler and it looks good
in the case so if you have a custom
build you're doing that demand something
like this with similar performance to
see LCS and you really don't care about
that extra one to three degrees Celsius
you can get with a 1250 or an H 110 then
this is your best bet because it's going
to look better for your type of build
and it performs fairly similarly and
about the same level of silence when
they are on their silent settings third
you're buying this for endurance it has
a 300 thousand our rating of life on the
fans that is going to last a lot longer
than most of these tubes will or the
liquid on units like the H 100 I because
it doesn't have to deal with evaporation
or age over time and if you leave the
system alone for a while it'll be fine
too so if you want something
longer-lasting and that requires less
maintenance in a couple of years then
this is a good bet now in terms of value
you really should be buying an argon ar0
one if you're trying to build on more of
a budget it's $35 so that is one third
of the price and it performs effectively
identically it is within margin of test
error so you do the math you know if you
want a cheaper build you get the AR 0 1
if you can handle slightly louder noise
and you don't care for the cooler to
last for your entire life it's still
you're going to get a couple years out
of it that's good enough for most people
if you want liquid you can go with the
1250 for a hundred bucks you can go with
an X 44 I don't know something like 80
to 90 I think X 61 for 140 so there are
a lot of options out there flanking the
DRP 3 in terms of liquid that is
I have to say about this click on the
link in the description below for full
details and more of my opinions and I
will see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
