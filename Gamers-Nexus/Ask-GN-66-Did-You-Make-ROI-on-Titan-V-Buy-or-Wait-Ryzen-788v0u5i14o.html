G episode if you have questions for next
time leave them in the comment section
below and please try and upload each
other's actual questions so that I can
find them rather than waiting through a
bunch of memes about cats which makes it
really difficult to find the actual
questions so this time we have a couple
good ones on by or wait for Rison + /
risin - a common one did you make ROI on
the Titan V we also had a question about
the GN mod mat and it's spill resistant
properties which required us to film an
infomercial first we've ever done we
hope you enjoy before getting to that
this content is brought to you by the
Thermaltake flow RGB closed-loop liquid
cooler which is a 360 millimetre
radiator + 3 120 fans that are RGB
illuminated if then we'll take it ringg
fans at that this is a 4.5 done a stack
pump which one of the faster pumps you
can learn more at the link in the
description below so let's do buyer
weight first again we did this for the 4
Volta last time I think largely the same
answer here basically if you need a
computer today then you should buy stuff
today
the prices aren't gonna change that much
at this point it's looking like the rise
in sale prices are more or less becoming
the rise in prices the retailers have
only increased them once or twice the
last couple months back to where they
were and rising seven seventeen hundred
and five sixteen hundred have state
basically on sale almost for the last
two months now so I wouldn't worry too
much about the prices going up they
might a bit after Christmas and the
holidays but either way these are still
good processors and there's no reason to
feel bad about buying a good processor
if it does what you want it to do
obviously like any production tasks or
blender or video rendering or any of
that type of stuff that might take
advantage of those cores they're good
for that already and Rison plus will be
a refresh in the same way that some of
Intel's plus to market demarcate lines
have been refresh is an Intel sort of
started that with their
plus nomenclature that they just stick
at the end of an existing fab process to
make it sound like it's more advanced
than it really is
and yes they changed things like like
fin height and gate pitch and things
like that but ultimately it's not a
massive change
so and it's gonna be the same Verizon
Plus that's it is advancements on an
existing CPU that means it'll be things
like tuning frequency perhaps or tuning
memory timings or memory compatibility
in general or things of this nature that
have been done or learned about over the
past however many months since it
launched I guess about nine months at
this point so yeah the answer to wait
for a rising plus or buy comes down to
do you need a computer today and if you
do then buy something the way I always
do this and I think I said this in the
last one too is I would suggest asking
yourself first am I happy with my
current machine the answer to that
should be contingent on does your
current machine do what you need it to
do in a reasonable amount of time
because you're asking about rising plus
in this scenario I would assume it's
probably for some kind of production
machine not just gaming so if that's the
case you should be looking at how long
does it take me to render the things I
need to render and then go find some
benchmarks how much faster is rising now
today is that speed benefit something
that will benefit me now today or can I
live with what I have that's really all
it comes down to now timelines Rison
plus and rising two is really far away
there was a headline in our news video
last week we had a source what's a
couple article sources that said rise
into first quarter 2018 that's
objectively incorrect it's really easy
to prove you can look at am these own
timelines the ones that they gave us in
March at the Rison announcement and
launched and it was not rising - in
first quarter of 2018 I can tell you
that right now
so that's wrong what we talked about in
the video the news video I basically
took that and without really explaining
why I called it Rison plus that
the reason why risin + will be coming
out sometime in the first half now I
don't know exactly when but I know that
they're gonna be talks about risin plus
at CES we're not under embargo for any
of that in fact I don't think we've
currently scheduled a meeting but we'll
work on one but yet there will be
conversations about it soon within the
next few weeks I don't know when it
launches but the answer is still the
same though it's you know you're looking
at a launch after probably January so
can you live without a computer for a
month if so wait if not by now there's
no reason to feel buyer's remorse about
buying a processor that's still
perfectly good and probably a bit
cheaper than what's going to come out
with Rison plus so that's how I look at
it that's also why I think the prices
are basically permanent at this point
they're trying to leave room for when
Rison plus comes out which is better I
guess than what intolerant really does
they just keep everything the same price
but I don't know hopefully that gives
you some idea of timelines and things
like that you're looking at first half
for sure probably so that's kind of my
understanding right now and then the
rest is personal preference did you make
ROI on the Titan V this is a not asked
by any particular person we had a couple
different people asking this so the
Titan V was a three thousand dollar
business expense I say that specifically
for a few reasons
a business expense is not you just
dropped three thousand dollars on a
video card you can afford lots of things
no I did not spend three thousand
dollars on a video card my company spent
$3,000 on a video card there's a big
difference there one of us can afford it
the other one can't so the company
bought an expensive video card as a
business expense the very short answer
did you make ROI is yes the longer
answer is and I'm only talking about
this because I think a lot of people are
interested in it the longer answer is
there's different forms of ROI you can
make as a media outlet and that would be
things like direct ROI when you watch a
video you might be served a YouTube ads
add or you might be YouTube red
subscriber
either of those situations gives us
direct ROI return on investment where
you're generating probably fractions of
a penny with your views on that content
we can get a lot of views on that
content that's a lot of fractions of
pennies but it doesn't equal $3,000 so
there's also indirect ROI that would be
things like the easy one affiliate
revenue this product doesn't generate a
lot of affiliate revenue it's a $3,000
video card that doesn't fit our core
audience so we kind of ignore that one
there's where affiliate revenue would
apply would be things like more
affordable like cases and things like
that there's also direct ad sales that
would be when we place an ad like the
one that was probably at the start of
this video unless it was for one of our
own products but we have ads for thermal
grizzly Thermaltake we've run I fix it
we've run EVGA we've run AMD in the past
we've run Nvidia in the past so all
these different advertisers are the
direct sales that would still kind of
fall into the bucket with Adsense ads
where they go together but it boosts the
purview basically dollar value it's
still gonna be low you're still talking
often well always pennies or fractions
of pennies per view but then there's
other forms of interactive ROI like we
sold a good amount of ads for December
because it's end of year this is pretty
normal end of year everyone is all the
businesses are spending all the rest of
their budget for the year basically
every business because you're trying to
get stuff in before tax season or you're
trying to get if you're a large company
you're trying to spend your marketing
budget or whatever it is so that you can
claim you need it next year when they
revile you ate your budget if they say
you had ten thousand dollars left so
we're gonna give you ten thousand
dollars less this year so everyone's
trying to spend money so we sell more
ads and we need to place those on videos
and make sure we get views on them so
that's kind of indirect there's also
finally it's this was large
about a new architecture and learning
about it and trying to get a head start
on what we do when the next actual
gaming architecture comes out we did
this with Vega Frontier Edition as well
it gives a huge leg up in terms of
knowing what to expect and what quirks
there will be in a new architecture so
now we have all this experience with
Volta and when it's not it probably
won't be almost certainly what we call
it Volta but when the gaming derivative
comes out we'll have a bit of an
advantage we already know all the quirks
of Volta so if any reasonable amount of
that finds its way into gaming we
already know it's test that cuts out a
huge amount of work for me in a couple
months and it puts us a bit ahead of
competition so that's another form of
indirect ROI and then there's things
like just you know we you become one of
the only sources of information so
people in the industry are watching
those videos not just enthusiasts but
you're looking at industry contacts
watching the videos and that has
potential for ROI later down the road as
well because they see you as willing to
invest in your company to prove a point
or to learn about something and also
sort of sends a message that hey if you
don't send us the thing we'll buy it
anyway so you can't really hide it from
us so there's a lot that goes into it
there's obviously there's a a financial
standpoint there's a status standpoint
establishing yourself in the industry as
very serious and taking your job
seriously there's learning a new
architecture trying to establish a
foundation for later and then there's
recognition from your peers or from your
counterparts in the companies in the
industry that's also very important and
highly valuable so it's a big risk
investment to buy a component like that
and it always is but you got to kind of
got to put your money where your mouth
is sometimes and hope it pays off so
that's it for that one next question
first real question is
Raptor who says why does the performance
of Nvidia cards scale with core count
when looking within the same
architecture but doesn't for AMD cards
this is partially true they can 56 and
64 you don't see a lot of difference in
performance once you get past 56 see use
in this instance and go towards 64 AMD
at this point becomes more memory
bandwidth limited than anything else and
Vidya tends to become Rob's limited so
where you'll see and Vidya encounter
issues would be something like Ghost
Recon or destiny to both of these games
are dx11 and both of them rely a lot on
ROPS and so if you look at the titan
beavers Titan XP the gains they're like
4% you look at those same two cards and
something like sniper the games are way
more meaningful upwards of 40% in some
instances so Nvidia doesn't it's not
always true that performance scale as
well with core count because again
Titan B's like 50 120 cores versus 3584
whatever it is on a 1080i or Titan XP
yet it's 4% difference in a game like
destiny or Ghost Recon depending on the
settings so not always true but it is in
a lot of cases same for AMD and these
scales better than some games than
others but AMD tends to become memory
bandwidth bound before they become bound
by anything else and it's also an issue
of GCN reaching its limits at 64 ciues
that's pretty much always been the case
once you get to 4096 SP is on an AMD
device you're really getting diminishing
returns now first is whatever the
immediate skew is below it maybe that's
60 or 56 or whatever it is so it depends
a lot on architecture depends a lot of
game depends on the API all that kind of
stuff they become bound in different
things and the for example for the
longest time would become really bound
in geometry and they sort of started
fixing that with Polaris Polaris changed
its geometry pipeline and then Vega
later changed the geometry
pipeline further and started adding more
advanced choline tasks or sequences to
it so Nvidia again it's largely ROPS I
think for the most part there are some
things they can become memory bound in
but with g5x for example you start to
become more bound by the timings of the
memory than the speed itself timings are
a bit looser than gddr5 but yeah alright
hopefully that gives you some ideas for
your question next one is Dane of
Starfall I'm this one's gonna be quick
in your Titan V video where you test the
limit of PCIe you said that rise of the
Tomb Raider is not a good benchmark
title this is strange to me as I see the
game on almost every GPU receive a
benchmark out there can you explain why
you don't think it's a good Bend for any
title right as a Tomb Raider has a ton
of variants you can run the test like 5
or 10 times and you'll see way more
margin of error or variance than
basically any other title we benchmark
so we don't use it right as a Tomb
Raider also it's so there's it's not
really a perfect benchmarking title
because you can run the built-in
benchmark it has all those variance
issues and other issues but if you get
into actual game play it will start to
smooth out a bit the problem is those
numbers don't really compare to a bunch
of other sites because they don't
necessarily test in the same areas
that's ok though so we're kind of used
to that so I don't know the way I look
at it is rise so when you're choosing a
games benchmark you choose based on how
consistent is it how easy it how easy is
it for me to get to the area I want to
benchmark do I want to automate it or am
i testing it manually in actual gameplay
so you take all those things you decide
what game and then you're looking at
things like API and you're looking at
does this game tell me something
different then games 1 through 6 if the
answer is no then it's of no value to us
so you look at things like DirectX 11 12
Vulcan and OpenGL ok we have a bunch of
API to represent then you look at Unreal
Engine
CryEngine unity and whatever else maybe
they're often things like frostbite or
standalone one-off engines you could try
to pick one of each of those and one of
each API and they all represent
something different
so the point doesn't to have a lot of
games it's having a set of very
consistent games that represent
different things there's no point in
having 25 games if at the end of the day
you could just kind of have five and it
would represent the exact same thing so
basically with rise of the Tomb Raider
it's not very consistent so that I don't
trust the results and that causes a lot
of stress and retesting so waste time
it's not heavily played so it's not
worth the inconsistency a game like pop
G I could probably argue for it even
though it's pretty inconsistent and not
optimized but that's because a ton of
people play rise of the Tomb Raider
doesn't have that going for it so not a
huge reason to to fight against the
title for that but yeah I mean we we
basically looked to benchmark Vulcan
look to benchmark compute tasks you look
to benchmark things that are geometry
geometrically complex things that are
tessellation complex or heavy things
that are using asynchronous workloads
and pipelines and then different api's
and you should end up with six to eight
games I like to pull about eight and
then we start cutting games as they
prove to be bad for testing normally
from inconsistency or
maybe they've just released a patch that
bachas all of our numbers and we'd have
to rerun it so you just you know we'll
cut this one out for this benchmark and
we'll reintroduce it later I hope for
that gives that gives kind of a bunch of
different things to think about nori SS
says GN covers performance engineering
and stability characteristics what about
warranty support what happens if
something goes bad we actually wrote
years ago I wrote a warranty support
table that kind of gave an idea of the
warranty period and whether they do
cross shipping and things like that so
the trouble is with warranties
it's kind of different in each region I
know how EVGA is warranty works in the
US I know they're probably at least 90%
of the time gonna be pretty good about
their warranty in the US but I've heard
that they're not so great for some other
countries and it's just a matter of
where does the company operate do they
service each region the same the answer
is normally no no one really has that
many resources to spare so if I were to
start talking about warranties they'd
have to always have a big tag of like in
the US and 55 percent of our viewers are
not in the US so I just leave it out and
honestly there are some things that
although it would be it would be great
if we can reasonably talk about
warranties there are some things that
are better left to user reviews just by
the nature of aggregating thousands of
them and I think warranties are one of
those things because you can't
necessarily trust a user review on
Amazon or Newegg of a router because
they're gonna say this router sucks my
internet slow no your ISP is slow the
router doesn't suck your ISP sucks but
you can trust user reviews generally for
things like warranties because that's a
very basic human interaction between a
company and a customer so I would rather
leave it to the aggregate of thousands
of users then we've done kind of like
undercover warranty or service calls
before with sis I'm a power cyber power
origin
I've called each of them basically
disguised as a customer and asked for
support and included those in those
reviews but that's about the most we can
do I can't really test a warranty
process unless I were willing to like
delay the review by weeks and
intentionally break components see what
they did or something and that's still
only really one representation and then
if they figure out it's me obviously
they're gonna make sure everything is
perfect because they know it's going to
go into a review next question supa says
in your review of the Fraxel define r6
while discussing GP temperatures in the
vertical orientation you stated quote
the vertical GB amount caused a huge
temperature increase as usual can you
explain a wide vertical mounted GP is
tend to run hotter quote as usual we did
this in a couple of videos
and I didn't do it again in the r6 video
the short of it is you're putting an
open-face card an inch or two away from
an insulating four millimeter thick
glass panel those open-face cards they
need air they need a lot of air in front
of them to pull air into the fans and
then when they're done with the air you
kind of think about how they're laid out
that error it can't go straight through
the PCB so it has to come out the sides
so it's coming out wherever the fins are
oriented typically at the top and as
that error spews out of the open face
card it's going to go two places one it
will go up into the CPU radiator if you
have one above it and that'll make your
sea view a bit warmer but it'll get rid
of the heat and push it out of the case
the other one is it'll go down hit a
power supply shroud which is now
probably right below your GPU because
it's vertically mounted and kind of get
stuck there maybe even sort of bounce
back up and get recirculated and then
ultimately what happens is that piece of
glass starts warming up your air gets
stuck against it you can't get new air
in fast enough so the card runs a lot
warmer sometimes in the 90s whereas a
horizontal mount might be an upper 70s
or the low 80s and it's just a matter of
what kind of card it is now this is a
scenario where so first of all full
disclosure these are really meant for
liquid cooling but this is a scenario
where a blower card might actually be
better because the blower card doesn't
need as much exposure to air in terms of
a big wall of air right in front of the
cooler and it pushes air only in one
place and that's out of the case rather
than all over the case so that's what it
comes down to the next one serpent XF
xsf this was a fun question what was
your first ever graphics card why did
you get into the computer industry and
reviews of computer components do you
have any IT certifications bridge
graphics card I think was the ATI X 1800
512 megabyte card I pretty sure there
was a 256 model also I spent a lot more
money on the 512 and I remember the guy
at comp USA saying you're never going to
need
512 megabytes of memory huh and I
remember hearing the same thing when I
bought a GTX 8800 Ultra later I don't
remember how much memory that had but it
was another one of those you're never
gonna need that much and look where we
are today at the time it was kind of
accurate but so I out of interest I went
and looked up this card I found reviews
of the ATI X 1800 to see what people
said about it when it came out around
2000 four or five I think this was from
C night it was just the top result so
this is this is just kind of fun you'll
see the parallels in a second CNET said
although we weren't thrilled with its
design and wish that it brought more to
the table than simply catching up with n
videos feature set the ATI Radeon X 1800
X T's performance is hard to knock at we
used for certain games the results
remain consistent with the latest
generations conclusion that ATI fares
better at direct3d based titles like
half-life 2 and Nvidia dominates an
OpenGL 3d api's with doom 3 so a bit of
the inverse and these better with with
doom right now and NVIDIA is back to
dominating with DirectX 11 so that was
kind of fun to read they also said two
of our biggest gripes have to do with
the Radeon X 1800 XTS design the most
obvious is its double-wide form factor
CNET was annoyed that the card took two
expansion slots I have a shelf of video
cards that are 2.5 to 3 expansion slots
now so that's that's the state of the
industry when I got into it next or last
question here Carl says can I use that
GN anti-static mod matte with correct
capitalization included as an oversized
mousepad is it spill resistant so
technically in the product page there's
a line in there that a lot of you have
noticed that says not intended for use
as a mousepad and after that live stream
where we did it overclocking for like
two and a half hours I was using mice on
this pad the entire time at the end of
it I was like maybe undersold its
potential there you can use it as a
mousepad we didn't advertise it that way
because I don't want people who want a
mousepad
buying an anti-static mat that is not
really meant for that purpose if you're
only planning to use it as a mousepad
we appreciate the sales but you know
it's just like it's there's an intended
purpose for it you can use it as a
mousepad but it is kind of a grippy or
surface it's more towards the if you
ever buy one of those aluminum mouse
pads that's got a smooth and a rough
surface it's kind of in between those
there's a bit more texture to it so
there will be some drag on the mouse so
depending if you like that or not you
can use it as a mousepad but I didn't
want people buy it I would rather people
be pleasantly surprised that they can
use it for a mouse then people be
disappointed that they can't use it for
a mouse so that's why I didn't really
advertise it that way
and is it spill resistant the answer is
yes we spilled some liquid on it the
other day and it basically just sits
there on the surface so but that was the
whole point of going with this as
opposed like a felt or a fabric top
mousepad because this is a rubberized
surface its textured and it's again it's
anti-static it makes it spill resistant
makes it pretty damage resistant and
protects the table but not necessarily
perfect for a mouse pads those those
things don't go together you could use
it but you know I would suggest only
doing that if you also have another
purpose for it like wanting to use the
anti-static part of it and build stuff
on the surface and that's all for this
one so I think all these questions came
from discord this time because the
youtube comment section was so flooded
with non questions that I had hard time
finding on e if you have questions post
them below and everyone helped float
those to the top if you want to join the
discord you can go to
patreon.com/scishow and donate to join
our discord for the community or you can
always have that store that gamers Nexus
dotnet or store that gamers Nexus dotnet
slash mod mat if you want to buy one of
these now that we've done the marketing
pitch saying that it is hydrophobic or
something it's not actually hydrophobic
but it's kind of spill resistant I'm not
very good at marketing all right
