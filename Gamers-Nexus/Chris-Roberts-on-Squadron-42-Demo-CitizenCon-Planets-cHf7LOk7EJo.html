the star citizen event i'm joined by
chris Roberts everybody how you doing
before getting to that all this coverage
is brought to you by antec and their new
cube MITx case as designed by razor
which is shown on the screen now
supports full custom loop water cooling
you can learn more on the link below
Chris can you give us a quick recap of
your own impressions of the event that
you just put on then we'll go into some
of the details I know is I mean like the
it's always all these events are
fantastic games gone since gone but I
mean citizen concert so I'll get my hand
out there this is cons or it's about the
community I mean we wouldn't be here
without the community they've supported
at us enables us to grow to the size we
have enabled us to sort of build the
technology that we're working on now
which is far beyond whatever I pictured
her envisioned when I first pitch star
citizen I mean I dreamed about this
stuff but I didn't think I'd be able to
be doing it so so early and I mean it's
great i mean the energy it's it's like
you think about it you put your
presentation together you do your demos
but when you actually get in the room
and you feel the energy it's a
completely different things so I i love
it i mean it's it's a whole bunch of
people that are really passionate for
exactly the same game that i'm
passionate for and yeah we're just a
bunch of big space game cheeks i don't
know to say so for the immediate roadmap
for people to watch out for you had on
stage some slides about 2.6 3.1 3.1 3
123 so what are the the major key points
for folks to know about for each of
those road maps well I mean 26 is the
one that we're going to have star marine
finally out there where we have this
separate game mode for FPS we're
actually have two different maps two
different game modes so we'll be able to
have 24 player matches down to like a
player matches but essentially it's you
know allowing you to jump into a FPS f
PvP game quickly sort of like you won't
you be used to in battlefield or call of
duty or something as a sort of play FPS
and not have to travel to a location to
do it and not have to risk the things
you would risk normally in the game and
then we're sort of spending time also an
arena commander working on sort of the
balance and how the ship's feel when
they fly
Doug fightin and make the whole process
of you know getting a new game iterating
playing more and more matches much
simpler easier to get into and then
things like you know the cameras were
the working on to make better so says
you won't trying to make is sort of the
quick game experience and sort of
representative of like the dog fighting
experience of representative of the FPS
experience is there for you to access to
play without fun with while some of the
bigger you know sort of pu persistent
universe you know the place that you'd
explore in with continuing to flush out
because there's a lot of people just you
know play arena commander right now and
we're going to have I think a lot of
people that hopefully placed our marine
and they'll be sort of practicing their
skills ready for Showtime when you know
the game becomes you know the universe
becomes bigger and things are more
persistent I want to ask one question so
squadron 42 I know we didn't see an
unveil here today can you give kind of a
yeah reasoning why oh I so I mean I
mentioned when we interview before that
was heaven we were going to show one of
like the week so essentially in our
process we were sort of content story
content complete so we filmed all our
stuff we're very far along on most the
assets and we have all this the
emissions chapters however we call them
sort of blocked out you know so what we
call white box somewhere much further
stages along we're taking one of them
which is why we was planning originally
i'm showing here to a final polished
finish level but it's very important to
be that final polish finish level so we
got pretty close but i didn't feel like
we were close enough and I you know so
for me I'm squadron 42 that was sort of
the commitment i made as i'm going to
show you it but when it's when it's
ready so we're not quite there yet we're
you know we're we're continuing on that
and we will show that when it happens
which but that sort of sets the bar for
the rest of it so when all that's here
and that's sort of like our ability to
because a lot of times until you start
bringing everything to the final quality
you're not parching the animations
you're not really stress testing with
technology you're not uncovering sort of
the edge cases between things working so
that's a lot of what's been going on in
the last and we've been working on this
this sort of squad
for you to obviously for a long time but
even this final chapter for quite a
while trying to bring everything up and
like you know we're not happy with
something that's okay or good or kind of
like some one other game it needs to be
people are moving around it needs to be
super fluid and you don't feel like oh
he's jumping between AI locomotion and
then a pcap scene which you see all the
time in games so we weren't quite ready
to show it all so you kind of don't want
to show too much stuff all at once I
mean we showed a pretty big pretty on
there and sometimes I think that's a
problem you know like last year at
Gamescom we showed the work merit or
where the characters were much more
basic than they are now and really 20
sort of overshadowed it which was a
large world than the procedural stuff so
for me I kind of felt like I'm we're
putting our best foot forward and I you
know so I show the you know the crash
Gavilan demo with big space worm but you
sort Weiss shooting was but you know
that that's yeah that's kind of what the
experience will look like and we're like
yes this is what it will be but on
squadron 42 it's like another little
level beyond that so we weren't quite
ready there but you know we have a
couple live streams this year we do want
to November one in December so tune in
for those and you never know what you'll
see and all valid reasons of course if
you want to see more about the demo hit
the link in the description below we've
already cut a 2,000 word article online
covers all the stuff we just talked
about here and more thank you as always
chris no promise you can see ya thank
you it's good to see you thanks for
coming yeah I'll see you all next time
All Right see you next time guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
