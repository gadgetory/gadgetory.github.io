the most graphics intensive games of its
time especially with physics which if
you ever broke glass in the game or a
helicopter shot at you and broke the
glass there was terrible lag for low-end
cards and it was all in the physics
processing now a Mirror's Edge catalyst
is out and we've got the full GPU
benchmark on the new game using our
benchmark course that we published in
yesterday's video and that includes
everything up to the GTX 10 series cards
1080 1070 and Andy's fury XO type the
high end and the 390 X has sort of our
baseline for AMD performance before
getting to that all this coverage is
brought to you by enter max on their new
lick max giant open loop liquid cooling
solution so back to the benchmarks we
ran the same course three times on each
card for parity using a couple different
settings 1080 1440 and 4k for the
resolutions with high ultra and hyper
which is the highest setting for
Mirror's Edge catalyst the test system
is shown on the screen now you can see
all the parts views there but for more
information on our testing methodology
the article is linked in the description
below and contains more depth note that
mirrors edge already has game ready
drivers from both AMD and NVIDIA the
drivers we used for testing are these
latest ones as of today and that's the
36 8 39 and video drivers and 16 dot six
dots one and the hotfix drivers graphics
settings in Mirror's Edge catalyst again
go from low to high / and hyper is a
step above Ultra the main options
include an fov slider for your field of
view adjustment and quick note here it
goes from 60 to 90 or a hundred and at
the very high end of that I'm like some
FPS games Mirror's Edge does get a bit
distorted on our display so we didn't
play with the 90 to 100 highest fov
settings we use the lower settings just
for a more default setup since that's
probably what most people be playing on
the usual vsync settings are also
present and there's a couple of other
important options like GPU memory
restrictions and that's one where you'll
want to disable it if you're trying to
test yourself because the game will
dynamically scale graphics based upon
active GP performance so disabling is
critical for benchmarking which we did
you might want this on if using a card
with lower
memory capacity like two to four
gigabytes the rest of the settings are
the usual mix of texture quality which
is basically texture resolution and
post-processing mesh and reflection
qualities reflection quality plays a
bigger role and mirrors edge than most
games given that so many reflective
surfaces are present ie mirrors edge
post-processing quality is also big as
Mirror's Edge catalyst seems to derive
most of its visual fidelity from
graphics processing happening at the end
of the pipeline after rasterization and
that's one of the settings you'll want
to know for FPS games before getting to
the results for 1080p 1440 and 4k
testing here's a quick look at some of
the research we did so I ran tests from
high ultra and hyper at 1080p on a 3 90
X and this was strictly for my own use
to figure out how i should benchmark the
game how we should run the tests on the
different graphics settings the cards
but it was worth publishing just to show
these scaling of performance across
different graphics settings Ultra runs
about fourteen point three six percent
higher an average FPS than hyper 1080p
during our quick research hi runs about
thirty eight point four percent faster
than ultra and then we have been unable
to get hyper reliably executing on some
cards like the fury acts and 970 and
that instability seems to coincide with
devices running four gigabytes of vram
device is running six to eight didn't
have this issue though the RAM
consumption is nearly seven point five
gigabytes on 1080p with hyper settings
and is around six point six gigabytes at
4k with high settings and then we top
five gigabyte utilization on 1080p with
ultra settings so it looks like the
industry is continuing its push into
games requiring more than four gigabytes
of vram here's the chart showing 4k
benchmarks with high settings the GTX
1080 pushes the highest frame rates at
51 FPS average and this is generally
playable and mirrors edge but you have
to tweak some settings to sustain
50-plus FPS with better regularity
particularly in combat intensive
scenarios the fury ex and r9 390 ex both
suffer from poor frame times performance
and low frame rates at the bottom end of
the performance spectrum and the GTX
1070 holds better one percent and point
one percent low outputs than these two
cards but still sits at just above 38
FPS average here's 1440p the r9 390 X
now sits at 53.3 FPS average but still
has poor 0.1% low performance the 390 X
can generally handle 1440p what would
require some tweaks to improve low-end
FPS the fury X has these same issues but
hasn't improved average at 63 FPS and
that puts the fury x at sixteen point
six eight percent faster than the 390 x
1.5 seven percent slower than the nine
seventy and forty point two percent
slower than the 1070 the gtx 1080 1070
and 980 TI are all performing at similar
marks in this test due to some sort of
bottleneck in the system we're still
investigating this but it could be
memory or some other limitation I'm not
positive yet either way these cards
perform effectively the same and
performance there's some variants in the
lowes but really that could all be
wrapped up as some sort of bottleneck
within the system and more or less the
averages are pretty close to our
tolerance for error at 1080p ultra thins
loosen up a bit more the gtx 1080 pushes
137 fps and holds a noteworthy lead over
the 980 TI hybrid with a 21-point
eighty-six percent gap between the two
the r9 390 X does much better but still
has poor 1% in 0.1 percent low
performance The Fury X shows nearly a
ninety-five percent gap in its average
and 0.1% load dips making for some
visible and jarring frame output at
times the r9 380 x holds strong at 56.3
FPS average again with gaps in frame
times and the gtx 960 runs nine point
eighty eight percent slower and it's
averages than the 380 x but has 13.8
percent better one percent blows and
41.3 % better 0.1 percent blows the 970
and 1070 hold above a 60 FPS average
with the 1070 in 1080 separated by about
18.5 percent in terms of their Delta at
1080p hyper the 1080 runs 29 point five
percent slower than on 1080 ultra so
that's the GTX 1080 just to be clear on
1080p hyper vs. 1080p ultra the r9 390 x
holds at 54 FPS about 25 FPS behind its
17
9.7 average at 1080 altra and the fury
ex and 970 were unable to complete this
benchmark and exhibited instability that
we believed to be a result of their
lower vram capacities of 4 gigabytes so
then as always a quick conclusion with
sort of the best video cards depending
on what settings you're looking for kind
of your price range at 1080p with ultra
graphics if that's your thin the gtx 960
and r9 380 x both do pretty well and
their averages with the 960 generally
pushing a better one percent and point
one percent lower than the 380 x at a
mix of medium and low settings if you're
willing to go down to there at 1080p you
can get away with the 950 or the even
though r9 270x if you have that older
card in your system but you will be
running a mix of low and medium settings
to achieve that especially in the combat
intensive post of X and physics
intensive scenarios at 1440p the GTX 970
is still a good card if that's what
you're running I know a large part of
the market does have a 970 it's about
forty percent behind the GTX 1070 of
this particular resolution but still
proves pretty price friendly and is good
with performance overall the r9 390 X
hits about 53 FPS 53.3 FPS average and
it's got a good frame rate overall but
again has those lower one percent and
point one percent low frame rate outputs
which is not great because there's some
sort of sluggishness in gameplay at
times and hopefully that will be fixed
with drivers or something else it may
even be a setting of the game I haven't
gone as far as individually checking
every setting but it may be the case
that Andy struggles with one of those
some very specific settings in the game
and that couldn't act the low
performance as far as 4k goes even at
high settings which is reduced from
ultra of course the GTX 1080 does
struggle to hit 50 FPS but manages to
hit it on average you would want to do
some further tweaking to ensure that you
stay at that 50-plus FPS mark Mirror's
Edge generally doesn't require quite as
high frame rate as something like black
ops might if you're a competitive player
because it's mirrors edge is more of a
single player game but all the motion
move all the movement all the motion
blur all these effects will sort of
stack up and if you turn too quickly at
times with the lower frame rate like 40
or below it really does impact gameplay
so you want to stay in the higher mark
50-plus in this case overall Mirror's
Edge catalyst it was pretty consistent
in its performance it's one of the
easier games to benchmark you can find
our benchmark course in the previous
video or probably scattered throughout
this one but everything 963 idx are
better if you're at the 1080p ultra
resolution otherwise obviously a
higher-end card as always links in the
