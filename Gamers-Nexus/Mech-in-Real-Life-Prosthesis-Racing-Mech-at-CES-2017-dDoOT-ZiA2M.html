am bi I'm in front of a giant mech robot
so this is a mech racing robot I'm
joined by Jonathan working on the
prosthesis robot Jonathan how's it going
pretty good pretty exciting here yes so
we're gonna be talking about this thing
it's huge before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by cyber
power and there's cyber XL gaming PC
with an invertible motherboard tray
layout hit the link in the description
below for more information
so Jonathan starting straight off with
this can you give me a top-level
overview so we understand what we're
talking about yeah so this is a
purpose-built
off-road racing machine it weighs about
8,000 pounds it has a 200 horsepower
lithium-ion electric power plant and
it's a hundred percent human controlled
it has no self-awareness no sensors in
its joints it's truly a sports machine
and it requires an athlete to operate
it'll be a very challenging machine to
operate it requires an athlete does the
physical fitness of the pilot actually
matter yeah absolutely I mean it's gonna
be more about coordination as the
engineer my job was to make it stable
and learn about so the input forces will
be relatively low but you'll be strapped
in facedown in the harness flailing your
arms and legs controlling all the legs
of the machine with your own body that's
four legs right yeah four legs the
outside legs are controlled by your arms
and the inside legs are controlled by
your legs so it has a kind of a a gate
of a gorilla what's what functions can
this do I guess obviously walking can it
accelerate sprinting jumping yeah it is
it's intended to be a running racing
machine so it's got a meter of
hydraulically actuated leg travel and
then another half a meter of suspension
travel it's outfitted with custom SPECT
like off-road racing shocks so the
computer simulations were based on drop
test of a meter the computer simulations
also indicate that it will be able to
leap up to half a meter off the ground
from a standstill
which would be amazed
and then it's got a four and a half
meters stride so if you that if you're
doing that every half second like that's
30 kilometers an hour so 8,000 pounds
and it can jump about half a meter
you're saying yeah that sounds like a
lot of force it's a tremendous amount of
course we're running 3,000 psi on the
hydraulics and when you put it all
together there's about 14,000 pounds of
thrust making this thing jump what's
what's the current status we're getting
this actually in some kind of race even
if it's just like a times trial that's a
great question because it is the only
one of its kind in the world so time
trial is going to be the first format we
we have the control system designed and
built on a prototype leg back at the lab
in Vancouver and this powerplant and
like sort of structural architecture of
this is all working we had to position
it to move it here on the trailer so
we're gonna bring it back to Vancouver
in February after hitting SolidWorks
world in LA and put the interface in and
probably test it in the next six weeks
there should be some videos coming out
of it running around the fields and the
valleys this is all flat terrain for now
I guess definitely flat terrain for
starting these bumper bars actually
deploy almost right down to the ground
so they allow the pilot to train without
falling over and they've got big shocks
on them so and they also will write the
machine if it does end up face-first at
some point but it's capable of hills
stairs rocks whatever you name it and
how about for the the feet which are
massive obviously anything special going
on there the feet were actually one of
the most challenging parts of the
machine because there's so many demands
on a foot I mean the human foot is ultra
complex compared to just our simple
limbs the they're gonna have they don't
have them on now but they're gonna have
your polyurethane pads so part of the
development process will be to engineer
the right kind of compliance and the
pads will be wrapping like off-road
racing tires will take dune buggie tires
or atv tires and and wrap them around so
I'll have these big knobby toe pads you
can swap them out for like road slick
tires and then there's all the degrees
of freedom that the toes articulates so
that if you hit
they hit on even ground they don't just
warp there's a little bit of suspension
compliance in the ankles
so its feet are one of the greatest
challenges pretty cool anywhere that
folks can go to learn more or follow
your progress Twitter Khan's websites
yeah absolutely we've got a Twitter and
Instagram handle of racing underscore
MEK and pure in robotics comm is the
website that we'll be posting updates on
if you're in robotics is the joint
venture between me and my team and fury
on our top sponsor here so that's where
the the mech Racing League will be grown
awesome so if you want to learn more you
hit the links in the description below
or go to those locations thank you for
joining me Jonathan pleasure and we'll
see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
