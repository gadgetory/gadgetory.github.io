Nexus tonight and today we're looking at
silverstone - a cbc case the Sugo SD 0-8
we first found this case when one of our
regular builders on the forums built his
own h CPC and have since decided to use
it in our upcoming series of
mediterranean pc build articles which
we'll talk to you about how to build
these computers and why they are so
awesome for home theaters the case is
relatively large for an HT PC case that
is awesome to say by the way but not
intrusive ly large it measures at
roughly nine inches wide by 7 inches
long by 14 inches deep it has come
compact but deep so you'll need a long
shelf to accommodate the box however
that depth does not come without purpose
the case will allow video cards of up to
12 point 2 inches in length which should
be enough for just about every current
gen card with the exception of maybe a
few manufacturers takes on certain
high-end AMD cards so check
manufacturers specs to make sure yours
will fit do do factor in where the power
cables are for those cards I will note
because if it is on the if it is on the
outside the right side of the card you
may need to factor in that extra 1/2
inch or so that your cable will take a
quick overview of the specs reveals that
the case is equipped with a single semi
massive fan on the top it is 180
millimeters and runs at either 700 or
1200 rpm which will run at 18 or 34
decibels respectively this means that
the case is able to keep cool while
still running relatively quietly
although the faster rpm settings can be
unbearably loud in a true quote-unquote
living room PC environment where you
want it to be quiet so you can hear the
TV I found that the low rpm was setting
was capable of a CFM that was more than
acceptable for the abuse put on the
system even from games so I think you'll
be just fine at 700 rpm because it is a
larger fan that means it is a larger
hole so it can push more air through
there at slower speeds than say a 120
fan would be able to stick in with these
specs I review the SG 0 8 ships with a
600 watt PSU that is I believe a bronze
certified 80 plus bronze and far more
than it is it is far more than almost
all the other HD VC cases out there as
far as included PS
use so that is quite large 600 watts is
more than enough to power a true gaming
system not just a home theater box it is
also equipped to handle to handle just
about any CPU you can throw at it not
just ap use and low TDP CPUs and iGPS
and stuff like that the system ships
with a fan filter as well to place
between your GPU and side panel and
because dust is generally an issue with
HCPCS due to their increased likelihood
of ending up in a corner or sat upon by
cats it is a good addition to have in my
opinion the cases overall build quality
is fantastic I must say it has a very
sleek external presence and the front
panel is actually 10 millimeter thick
brushed aluminum making for an executive
like aesthetic the grilles are well
placed and fairly discreet while still
being accessible for parts that need
them like the CPU and GPU and of course
the PSU has its own grills that
correspond to its fans the sg0 e is
nothing flashy that's for sure but it
does follow a sleek and styled approach
and knows exactly what it wants to be
like I said executive comes to mind that
is definitely the word of the day for
this case rather than the transformer
appearance that we see in most modern
gaming cases unfortunately the second
thing you'll notice is the amount of
work required to disassemble the case so
that you can actually start building
with no tool list school screws excuse
me pre-installed you'll need to remove
three screws to the cover three screws
in the top fan to access the motherboard
four screws in the optical drive bay and
two screws in the drive cage it is it is
not terrible but truth be told if you
spend $200 on a case even if it includes
a PSU you'd expect to get something a
bit easier to work with
now once you've actually accessed the
interior you will find that the quality
is equal to that of the outside the
drive cage has a rubber rubberized screw
holders or rubberized walls really to
reduce vibration and noise and there are
pre-installed standoffs for the
motherboard that make installation much
easier I mean a little bit quicker I
guess and it ensures that you don't
screw up by forgetting to install those
standoffs which could of course
as a direct short your motherboard the
case is relatively open to work with
once it's all taken apart
I found that rate regular SATA cables
didn't mesh that well with the small
distance between the drive the SSD and
the side panel of the case so it is my
recommendation that you get some right
angle SATA connectors before ordering
this case or as you order this case
because otherwise you will simply not be
able to fit them or you will experience
issues with them disconnecting
unintentionally as you move the case
around on that same note there aren't
that many places to hide cables somewhat
expectedly so you'll have to be creative
in your management of them there are a
few places to tether cables get some
twist ties and tether them go follow our
cable management guide for more on that
if you have a larger GPU installed
that'll make things much much harder to
move around so also factor that in if
you're planning to install a big GPU
like a 5 70 or 60 70 or something like
that again though this case is
relatively open compared to its
competitors it is it is comparatively
significantly easier to build with than
many other cases of its caliber but $200
is a lot of money for a case in a power
supply and it is a nice power supply so
it can be justifiable but keep in mind
this is not just for a home theater PC
this is for a gaming PC that will be
used for more than just your living room
in my opinion now if you have a lot of
money and can afford it for a home
theater PC more power to you but
personally I would I would definitely
use this case for a true quote-unquote
gaming PC that you either want to be
very discreet very mobile or really just
quiet and kind of out of the way which I
guess was what discreet means I want to
highlight one more time that I think the
cases built quality is fantastic I had a
pretty good time building with the case
it was actually not too difficult it was
just a little bit annoying all those
inconveniences but really what are you
going to do is a good quality case a
good quality PSU for 200 bucks which is
not too unreasonable to ask consider you
could easily spend 80 bucks on a PSU and
then 100 bucks on a computing a normal
system so with that take all of these
minor complaints and bind and a
you need a case that is more fitting to
your budget like less than $100 or
something please post on the comments of
either this video or preferably our
review where I will see it and we will
help you with that that's really all
there is to this case it's fairly
straightforward it's small ish medium
size really can fit just about anywhere
and can fit just about any gaming build
as long as you have a mini ITX or dzx
form-factor motherboard it ships with a
reliable and nice power supply and I
feel like it'd be best to recommend to
this again recommend this case to those
who are planning on building full-on
gaming PC's especially if you want to do
land parties or something like that
you'll find the full review of this case
