nexus donna and once again at pax prime
2013 you've heard me say this a couple
times today it is day two now and my
voice is already going i am here with
stu grubs global marketing manager at
steelseries so we're actually talking
about the new Siberia elite headset and
let's do what can you tell me about the
headset can you give us a top level
overview of what we're looking at so the
Siberia headphones have been a staple in
steelseries for as long as I can
remember and when we wanted to make
another version of it we had to outdo
ourselves everybody loves the Siberia's
and you don't want to mess with a good
thing so when we came and looked at the
design decided to go big go big or go
home so one of the big things that we
did to keep the Siberia brand and the
idea of the Siberia alive is the
suspension headband design so we've
upgraded this with memory foam cushions
all across the top see nice big pillows
up there it's got a steel art as the
actual headband support which has the
two lines just like the original Siberia
a couple of the things that we did here
though it's more unique is this is
actually a USB soundcard enabled device
so you can plug this directly in or USB
soundcard an get a lot of great digital
features some of those include the
illumination currently the illuminations
in color shift mode which allows you to
pick two colors or more and it will fade
between those different colors right now
I think it's going between purple and
blue one of the other things we did is
got rid of the inline controls usually
the inline controls you'd have to kind
of fumble around on your chest wondering
where they ended up right to mute your
microphone or adjust your volume so we
put them right on the headset on the ear
cup with the microphone you actually
mute the microphone by simply turning
the dial inside of the headset and
you'll notice we also use an LED to tell
you when you're muted so that's how you
are mute and unmute the microphone on
the other side this style adjust your
volume for the headset you always know
where your ears are so it's really quick
to just reach up and be able to adjust
your volume
in addition to that the microphone is
actually upgradeable on this one you're
able to pop it off and it uses an
industry standard mmcx connector and
we're actually going to have a broadcast
level like mini condenser mic available
later on which is a very cool feature
for many streamers on twitch and
otherwise in addition the microphone is
active noise-cancelling so how it might
be difficult to hear me here if you had
active noise cancellation a lot of this
background noise would be eliminated so
you could hear me very clearly can you
tell us do you have an MSRP on this yet
release date yeah it's 199 and we're
going to start pre orders in September
17th and have you worked with any any
pro gamers on your response sponsor a
couple of teams these sports teams yeah
can you tell me more about your
sponsorships and how you work with them
and integrate them in the process sure
we sponsor quite a few teams and with
every product we make sure they get a
prototype version and they give us a lot
of crucial feedback that really makes
our products parade so for instance with
this one we gave it to them they told us
that they like to further all around
games when they played just about
anything because with a USB sound card
you can set your own equalizers so for
FPS games they were setting them to
highs and mids so they get here reloads
and footsteps but when they're playing
stuff like Diablo or Wow or anything
like that with a really like beautiful
environment they would set an equaliser
so they got a lot of bass and like dark
ominous sounds and all that and then
comfort comforts the big thing and
that's why you have these big squishy
cushions you'll notice that the cushions
almost look ridiculous because they're
full of memory foam and that was their
feedback you know we need this to be
able to wear this for hours so that's
where a lot of that design comes from
endurance gaming at its finest as far as
drivers can you tell me about the the
dry respect the frequency range sure so
these actually use a 50 millimeter
driver just like your original Siberia
these range from 75 hurts to 16,000
killer 16,000 hurts
is a little bit different in e3 we
launched the 8th series and those are 40
millimeter drivers specifically for
clarity these give you a lot of great
range from both the lows which they get
real low without getting muddy and you
get up into the highs it's very clear
and it's a nice experience very
wonderful experience all right once
