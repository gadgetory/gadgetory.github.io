before do we recommend doing this this
is our latest hybrid mod for the GTX
1060 it doesn't make a whole lot of
economic sense the PCB isn't in perfect
shape we had to do some filing of the
socket to fit the liquid cooler to it
and then we had to buy copper shims to
get the silicon to contact the cold
plate before getting to the results of
the 1060 high right which we now have
thermal and other results this video is
brought to you by MSI and their GTX 1060
gaming X with Twin Frozr 6 cooling that
we reviewed recently so just like the
our X 480 this was more of a mod out of
curiosity than anything to see what we
could learn about the card in the
process of tearing it down and testing
it and see what we can learn about if
liquid is actually worth doing at this
price point the answer is not really
because the a IV partners are really
good at what they do but well generally
sometimes they're not
but for cooling they're generally pretty
good at what they do with this we did
exceed the performance of a IV partner
models like the msi card but you're
still adding like a hundred bucks to do
this plus a lot of time so unless you
really want a weekend project i wouldn't
recommend it that said the results are
pretty interesting so here's what we
have for the thermals first of all even
with this crazy setup of silicon paste
shim paste cold plate we're still
getting a pretty good thermal output so
we managed to drive thermals down to
17.7 5 Celsius a load on the 10 60 and
that's a reduction of 25.9 Celsius from
the reference card idle is down to 3.3
Celsius from 6.2 Celsius versus an
after-market solution like the msi 1060
gaming X just because that's the one we
have we're seeing a reduction still of
19.6 Celsius so almost 20 saw C is
cooler than an AIB partner model though
of course it's liquid so you'd expect
that our maximum temperature is now in
the low forties non Delta as opposed to
the 71 Celsius throttle point ish of the
F equal or originally as we showed in
our review and most notably this thermal
improvement did not
once stabilized our clock rate without
requiring a power target increase so
previously with a 1080 hybrid and the RX
for 80 hybrid mods we saw that the clock
rate actually flatlined which is what
you want you wanted to be pretty
consistent with this we're still seeing
some spike eNOS and the only way to
really resolve that with the EFI model
of the 1060 seems to be increasing the
power target with the MSI card we have a
pretty flat clock rate for the most part
there's still a few sudden drops that we
talked about in the review but we're not
having to increase the power target in
order to flatten that clock rate and it
seems that a lot of this is just the
design of the board itself and there v
bios that they have the MSI card runs a
lower voltage to sustain the same clocks
that the efi card runs with a higher
voltage and that certainly accounts for
some of it as well we were able to
slightly increase the overclock of the
1060 with the hybrid mod like previous
hybrid projects but it wasn't quite as
much as we saw with the 1080 hybrid now
we're mostly hitting voltage limitation
so we're able to sustain a higher and
flatter overclock with the same 250
megahertz offset rather than the
variance of the air-cooled version which
was also 250 megahertz offset but it was
fluctuating between 20 88 and 2150 1.5
megahertz whereas the liquid-cooled
version that we built sits constant for
the most part at 2150 1.5 megahertz and
increasing that power target does
actually flatten the curve of the chart
so that's it goes to our theory that the
power is one of the main limits here the
efi card for the 10 60 FPS impact is
marginal we'll see an extra frame here
and there but that's it as we've said in
the past this really isn't a mod that
you're doing for X or frame rates that'd
be kind of insane because it's an extra
hundred dollars for almost nothing but
the mod is mostly for fun and to see how
things react to liquid and we do get a
pretty good thermal reduction so that's
potentially worth it for some users on
the higher end cards again wouldn't
really recommend it for this necessarily
at the price the GN hybrid does
routinely show merits of liquid though
from the 1080 1060 and our X 480 that
we've done one extra note here we're
able to run fan rpms at lower speeds to
reduce noise levels but still maintain
significantly better thermal performance
than the stock and AIB partner coolers
the radiator fan is
at 30% RPM and one of these tests that
you're looking at versus the 100% or
auto rpm and the giana hybrid version of
the 1060 rests at $25 nine Celsius with
that 30% fan speed there's only a 7.3
sauciest gain from the 100% fan speed
and it allows for further recalled noise
and by the way we're still barely 20
Celsius lower than the FE card with the
stock cooler or about 15 SLC's lower
than the MSI card okay so that's it that
was the ten sixty hybrid project I'm
going to take this one apart it does
look kind of cool but it's definitely
not healthy for the PCB there's not a
lot of point and keeping this one
assembled this way it's just annoying to
store so this will be taken apart we're
leaving the 1080 hybrid as it was our X
40 has been taken apart and reverted
back to stock for further testing so all
that's left standing currently is a 1080
hybrid but I'm sure we'll be applying
these coolers to more cards in the near
future so as always subscribe to that or
for that and patreon link the postal
video if you want to help directly
thanks for watching I'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
