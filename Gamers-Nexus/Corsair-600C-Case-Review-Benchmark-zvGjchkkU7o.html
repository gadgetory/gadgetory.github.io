dotnet and this is Corsairs brand new a
600 C case this is a $150 case and it's
got some interesting points about it
like the inverted ATX design which we'll
get to in a moment this case comes in
two variants there's the 600 C which has
this window that's probably reflecting
me right now in the camera and then
there's the 600 Q and the 600 Q is sort
of effectively quiet that's at least
what I translate the cute I mean and it
has no side panel window it instead
replaces that space with some sound
damping or absorbing foam and that's the
Q version both of them are priced at
$150 and they both have the same chassis
and frame of course so let's dive into
this thing first of all it comes with
three fans all 140 millimeters two in
the front one in the back these are
intake that's exhaust and then it's also
got space for a 240 or 280 millimeter in
the front if you want to put that
alongside those fans or replace those
fans with that the back you can do a 140
millimeter radiator does support those
and then the ATX design is reversed so
normally with an ATX form factor case
you obviously first of all this is the
right side of the case if you haven't
noticed that so first of all this is on
the wrong side and normally it's
obviously on the left side as you all
know when you install the board the
system in the left side the GPU is sort
of half way down CPUs up at the top we
call it the north of the board and then
power supply these days is often on the
bottom of that was once different so
Corsair has gone back many years in time
and they've put the power supply at the
top but they've at least updated it to a
point that it makes more sense than it
used to
in this instance Corsair has taken a
page from NZXT YZ book with the H 440
and they've put a PSU shroud in there so
there's a big crowd covering the power
supply covering where the cables go and
actually covering the hard drive bays as
well so that's the next point that we're
going to look at here the drive bays are
all in the backside and the power supply
the cabling is on the back side so this
is a compartmentalized approach to
system building which improves ease of
installation in general especially in my
experience with all of these cases that
do this really and that the drives are
located three of them on the rear of the
motherboard tray
those are for 2.5 inch SSDs and then
you've got your standard 3.5 inch drive
bays up towards the front of the case
under the front panel input devices so
the main thing here is the focus on the
inverted layout this is very similar in
some ways to the Raven rv0 to the
Silverstone case that we reviewed some
time ago couple years ago and at the
time it was the best performing case
we'd ever reviewed in terms of thermals
now that case did something a little bit
different it still inverted the board a
bit rotated it this way and the intake
was all in the bottom in the RB 0 2 so
you had three intake fans I think there
were 180 millimeter off the top of my
head they push the air up and out
through a single fan and through the
power supply area where where this is
installed right now that is the stack
effect for cooling that's what it's call
it's called the stack effect and that
basically just takes all your air
channels it in the bottom forces it out
a tiny hole in the top so like a smoke
stack that was very high performing
especially for GPUs because you're
funneling all of this air straight
through that sort of grilled intake on
the average reference design GPU it's
rotated a different way that intakes in
a different spot but it does remind me a
lot of that case for its performance and
the reason it reminds me of it is
because you have your two intake fans
here they pull the air in and the air
stream splits so we have the power
supply fan pulling it up here that is
the only fan at the top there's a GPU
fan about this height then you have your
CPU cooler fan here which pulls most of
the air in and out through the back to
cool the CPU of course the GPU it does
have a blower fan in there with the
reference design so that's pulling air
in and the power supply is pulling air
up in toward it as well so your air
channel is actually very efficient and
as we see in the benchmarks that I'll
throw up here in a second the
performance impact is definitely
noticeable the one thing to look out for
is passively cooled power supplies so I
would definitely opt for an actively
cooled power supply in a case like this
even if it spins down during idle times
you do want it to spin up under load to
make sure that GPU is getting as much
air as it can possibly siphon away from
the CPU cooler especially if you use
a tower cooler on there because those
are pretty aggressive on their fan RPMs
with the radiator support one thing to
note here that's pretty important if you
opt to install a radiator in the front
you will be forcing heat into your case
that's how it works so with the radiator
if you push the heat into the case it's
not normally too bad depending on how
hot it is and what CPU you're cooling if
it's an fx ninety five ninety your
problems are a lot amplified first this
cooler TDP CPU so when you're forcing
the hot air in it's not going to impact
CPU temperature too much because that's
basically an isolated unit under the CPU
block under the cold plate but it will
impact the GPU temperature so I would
watch out for that let's jump into the
benchmarks and look at how this thing
actually performs in terms of numbers
and metrics and all of that stuff we
have 8 total charts four of them are
thermals at equilibrium and for our
thermals over time you can see them all
in the written review linked in the
description below which may contain
additional information not discussed
here the methodology is also in that
review if you want to know how we tested
it and see if you can replicate our
results of course there's 600 C
enclosure stands Supreme for its GPU
cooling ability dominating our charts
and this is especially noticeable with
multi card configurations as you'll see
in a moment with a single video card the
600 C leads the competition with hate
staggeringly low 2.4 for Celsius idle
delta T over ambient and that was on our
reference GTX 980 which was a relatively
warm card already and that beats out the
other three cases on the bench using the
600 C's a high fan speed setting to push
the full 12 volts to the fans the GPU
operates at 53 0.44 Celsius delta T over
ambient of about 21 Celsius or so
ambient and low falls slightly behind at
54.3 9 Celsius so you have about a 1
degree difference between low and high
which is a good thing if you want to run
the lower rpms for noise reasons
Rosewill is a b-2 spirit which was
previously our best of bench enclosure
for its chart-topping thermal
performance has been knocked into second
place
at fifty five point three three Celsius
with GPU benchmarks and the Delta
between the 600 Â°c and the b-2 spirit
is about three point five
so it's not huge but definitely enough
to be measured and not anywhere close to
margin of error the b-2 spirit is on
this chart but I want to emphasize that
is probably not the most linear
comparison because it's about the same
price maybe 20 bucks more depending on
when you buy it but it's massive it's
more of a server size case and that
means the people who are looking at this
thing might not be looking at the b-2
spirit but I included it because it's a
very strong thermal performer and I
wanted to see how a larger case compares
to something like this that's optimized
for air flow but smaller looking against
a more reasonable case something thats
on would more likely be considering a
purchase of the h4 40 v2 which is the
new version of the h4 40 runs
considerably warmer at fifty nine point
two eight Celsius and this is the cooler
version of the h4 40 and noctus 450
which is actually a good deal warmer
than the h4 40v to the Delta is 10.4%
here so that's definitely a gap that's
becoming noticeable particularly with
warmer GPUs and looking down to the
bottom of the chart we see ant xp3 80
that's really that's a case we weren't
too fond of at its first unveil at CES
and it ranks the warmest on the chart
throwing a card in for physics
processing this is something that
partially blocks the primary GPUs blower
fan and we see thermals rise about 10
Celsius on the Corsair case the b-2
spirit still stands just barely behind
but gains a noticeable two Celsius in
idle temps over the Corsair 600 C and
the Delta between the h 440 v2 and 600 C
shrinks 28.2% with multi-gpu setup so
it's actually better than it was
previously
but the GPU diode on our primary 980 is
now sitting at about 90 Celsius so that
gap might actually be wider based on our
data because the GTX 980 started
throttling its frequency and voltage to
keep the temperatures down so Nvidia's
card was actively throttling itself to
keep those temperatures at or below 90
and that's where you might see a
temperature rise if you're using a
warmer card like maybe an AMD card this
is certainly very impressive GPU
performance on Corsairs new case I'll
throw the thermal overtime GP charts up
here momentarily if you want to see what
those look like but the average data is
the same once it hits equilibrium moving
to the test methodology briefly as you
look at these what this shows is our
custom in-house scripted benchmarks so
this is an automated test it is fully
automated down to the second which means
that we can perfectly execute the
beginning of the load test and the
beginning of the idle test every single
time that's why you see these bars all
lining up effectively identically on the
chart moving on to CPU is at the b-2
spirit thoroughly trounces all
competition on the chart landing at
forty point five seven Celsius load and
fourteen point seven four Celsius idle
so the 600 C is in second place with its
high setting and third with the low
setting both of which outpace the H 440
v2 and the P 380 the 600 C sitting at
about 47 Celsius under load and there's
roughly a 1 Celsius gap between the high
and low settings which scene is pretty
acceptable for users who want to reduce
fan noise at the cost of a degree of
temperature rise it's really not a big
deal
so again it's worth noting that the b-2
spirit is a massive case and forces a
ton of air through its for fans so it
isn't necessarily a linear comparison
here it's a bit louder to subjectively
but if you're looking at to
high-performing cases that's about what
they look like the 600 C on the b-2
spirit with two GPUs performance is very
similar even marginally better in some
instances though it becomes a blurry
line whether that's margin of error
which we have about 1% of or if the
second GPS fans are actually changing
the air dynamic enough to improve or
decrease GPU and CPU cooling performance
based upon the aerodynamics and air
channeling of the case so a few things
wrapping up here we don't currently do
objective noise and decibel level
benchmarks which I'd love to do but I've
said it many times now in the comments
we don't do them because noise audio
it's very hard to do correctly you have
to have a perfect environment you have
to control a
and noise outside to influence it we
just we don't have the equipment or the
environment to test noise confidently
right now and if we can't test it
accurately I don't test it at all I can
tell you that subjectively with fan
speeds on low this is about where most
other kind of silent cases sit like the
aged 440 it is a bit loud with the fan
speeds on high but if you've got it on
the floor you're not gonna notice too
much of its up sitting on your desk more
next to your head at that height or
something like that then it will be more
noticeable but that's all very
subjective and probably not super useful
so I will leave the objective audio and
DB level testing to folks who have the
equipment to do so let's talk about the
stuff I do have available though and
that's thermals and design and overall
ease of installation with the 600 seat
started with ease of installation pretty
easy to install the standoffs are all
pre-installed which I'm a big fan of by
the way but the one thing I think
Corsair could improve on are actually a
couple things on the same point here
would be some sort of cut out in the PSU
shroud for the PCIe cables to the GPUs
this is something that NZXT does and I'm
in love with it OS 340 because you can
route the cable straight up through the
shroud and into the GPU and one it looks
a lot better too if you've got more
restrictive cabling setups like
surprising it with the enter Mattox 1300
watt PSU as they have shorter cables
then it will a it in both of those
instances but really it's mostly just a
thin with aesthetics it looks better if
Corsair can line it up so that you can
route a cable straight down through the
shroud and into the PCIe slots on the
GPU I would be very happy with that
change to the cable management now you
can to their credit route it through the
hard drive cages but you've got to
either remove them or sit there and
fidget with it for a few minutes and it
won't line up as perfectly because it's
coming down way in the front of the case
and I want it moved back a little bit so
that it lines up better with the GPUs
other than this maybe a cutout just sort
of in this angled bevel thing going on
right there that would probably help but
something in that range would be very
good for cable management the next thing
to build quality things here pushing on
this panel is pretty flexible it's
a little bit bendy there I don't know if
you can hear that on the audio but
picking the case up and moving it around
you will feel that flex a little bit so
it probably could be a bit sturdier but
how often are you really going to be
sitting there doing this while you're
playing games so it's it's really not
something I can knock them too hard for
because overall you get a large panel
clear panel and you're not really going
to get that without affording some of
your resilience in terms of structural
integrity because you have this huge
piece of plexiglass or whatever it is so
that you can see into the case so you're
sacrificing all this steel that would
normally surround it so I can give them
a pass on that the next thing I would
comment on in terms of the build quality
is the power supply mounting so there is
a small bracket on the back of this it's
a steel bracket and you screw that in to
the power supply just like the NZXT
cases and I think maybe the fantex cases
do it too at this point but there is
it's not thick enough at the top and the
bottom so the lip that you get that goes
over the power supply and slots into the
case can bend very easily and that can
happen just trying to install the power
supply if you don't line it up a hundred
percent perfectly which it is pretty
foolproof and you should be able to line
up a power supply perfectly because it's
a rectangle hole in a rectangle box but
as we found out if it's not a hundred
percent perfect then that steel will
bend with the slightest bit of force
because it's it's not very strong so you
have to sit there and kind of hammer it
back into place which is doable and you
can get it working but that is a point
of quality I think course art could
potentially look at in the future other
than that I do pretty much like
everything in the case the thumb screws
can maybe be torqued a little bit less I
think they're plagued by the same n60
problem where the thumb screws are not
actually toolless they require tools
because their torque too tight but it's
a good case at the end of the day and
this is something I would recommend at
$150 price point overall despite these
small things I just listed off very high
build quality there's a kind of nitpicks
the cooling performance is superior to
everything else we've currently tested
other than the b-2 spirit with its CPU
cooling and that's a much larger case at
potentially a different market
so the Corsair 600 C the one with the
window is a
case that I would say is worth looking
at for the enthusiasts $150 price point
on a case your next options to look at
if this does not interest you for some
reason or if you just want to do
research on your options which is always
good would be the age for 40 there's a
new v2 that is either shipping now or
will be shipping soon that's a bit
improved over the age for 40 v1
there's the another NZXT case the Knox's
for 50 if you want something more gamer
aesthetic looking than this or the h4 40
and if you look outside of NZ I've seen
Corsair there's a p38 II which is an Tex
case I'm not a huge fan of it but it
does have a sort of neat aluminum thing
going on in when now has some cheaper
cases at this price range it's just new
for them that's worth looking at - and
the rows will be two-spirit if you want
something sort of massive aside from
these the next one would be the silent
base 800 from be quiet which we tested
and liked pretty well it's very quiet as
the name would hopefully indicate and it
performs pretty well so that would be
the range of cases I would look at if I
were buying 150 ish price point plus or
minus 30 and that's all for this one if
