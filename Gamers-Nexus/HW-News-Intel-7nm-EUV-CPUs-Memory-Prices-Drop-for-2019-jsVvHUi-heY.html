including Intel working on its 7
nanometer process while simultaneously
working on its 10 nanometer process so
that is one of the biggest items here
Walmart slashing the price is on its
gaming PC's which it is still signed by
the way memory prices could slide 10% in
first quarter of 2019 and most
importantly we're working on a very
special video before that this video is
brought to you by coursers vengeance RGB
memory coursers vengeance RGB Ram uses
pre-screened ICS for better overclocking
Headroom and tighter timings of courses
RAM also has the benefit of wide region
motherboard support by landing on
qualified vendor lists for motherboard
makers and turn wide compatibility
between boards learn more at the link in
the description below
quick GN note first then some of you
know what that's referencing and if you
do feel free to update all the newcomers
in the comments below but there's a
reason it's on the table I'm gonna leave
it there other than that we just
restocked the beer glasses we restocked
the chalkboard shirts the blue print
shirts and the zipper hoodies so if
you're interested in those go ahead and
pick one up on store deck a mistake it's
not net so getting into the news items
here we have a couple of really
interesting ones and well let's just
start with the Intel 7 nanometer process
and their extreme ultraviolet
lithography progress this is something
that UV has been discussed for a long
time now a couple of decades and it
looks like it might be finally happening
following Samsung's discussion of its
EUV progress about a week ago Intel
announced to a roomful of NASDAQ
investors that it's extreme ultraviolet
lithography 7 nanometer node is forging
ahead for volume manufacturing toward
2020 we previously spoke with technical
analyst David Cantor about the
differences of Intel's 10 nanometer and
Andes 7 nanometers solutions and how
density means that these numbers aren't
as simple to compare as just looking at
their raw numerical value Intel's 10
nanometer might be more comparable to
and these 7 nanometer than AMD's 7
versus 10 or Intel's own 7 versus 10
inch or company intel has used deep
ultraviolet or d UV for its pseudo real
10 nanometer process pseudo real because
it only really exists in one primary for
form presently and that form is an ultra
low power low end skylake rehash known
as Cannon Lake Intel remarked that it's
duv and EUV teams are separate when
speaking with the roomful of Nasdaq
investors and this is something that
Anna tech picked up on further stating
that the teams worked on developing
their products simultaneously and one is
not replacing the other the in between
the lines but there is that 10 men 10
nanometre will still kind of exist in
some form as we'll see later in this
news show actually Intel has to do a few
things here to continue moving forward
with its progress on 7 nanometer and UV
and one of the major things that in size
to do is retrofit it's Arizona fab 42
fab 42 is been around a little while now
but the 7 nanometer node production
needs some new tools and so that fab
will get updated accordingly and other
than that the biggest news item here is
that Intel is projecting a doubling in
density as it moves forward with this
new production so 10 nanometer exists in
some limited form right now but it looks
like they're kind of setting their
sights on 7 nanometer for the big gains
and that is maybe some production 2019
but you're looking at volume production
2028 20 21 somewhere in that estimate so
20 20 plus or minus 1 it's basically
where we're at not even really want it's
more like plus 1 maybe minus 0.1 or
something to that effect so big news for
Intel their next one Walmart's slashing
prices on the gaming pcs now you might
have heard of these but if you haven't
there's a Walmart game in DC and just to
address some some confusion here
potentially it is actually a a Walmart
product so what it's not it's not like
saying Adele IRA power HP sorry PowerPC
that's in Walmart being sold by them
Walmart worked with eSports arena to
develop this product and so the Walmart
overpowered pcs if you haven't heard
enough about them at this point have
been dropped in price just really
driving in the dagger on how much we got
ripped off on the deal we are we are
working that out though we're gonna get
a get it swapped so don't worry about us
but if you haven't bought one yet and
you feel like a contrary and then you do
want to pick one up you can now buy the
dtw on which this mom was for a thousand
dollars and it was originally fourteen
hundred you can buy the GCW three which
is what we officially paid for now for
sixteen hundred or there abouts where it
was originally two thousand and after
taxes twenty to fifty one for us big
jumps there in price so contrary also
while we're on the topic to earlier
reports this week Walmart did not cease
sales of this product due to bad
publicity
in fact Walmart took down the pages
temporarily so that they could adjust
some values one of those being the price
other values that were incorrect
included advertising the product as
having twenty four hundred gigahertz
memory not sure well the support team
also kind of kind of confirmed that one
by replying to a comment on the
overpowered PC listing that said
something like wow 2400 gigahertz that's
really good and then they the the
representative said yes we try to build
the best PC as possible so I think that
mistake was potentially lost in them but
it's been updated that's the price have
been slashed which is huge and they are
not yo L as was reported earlier this
week or late last week something like
that next up memory prices so for this
one oh and I should note on the Walmart
front if you missed it our power supply
read our first ever power supply mini
review is now live and that feature is
the Walmart 500 watt great while power
supply you should definitely check it
out I will note here briefly that our
power supply testing has a really long
way to go we're aware of that we're
still learning but we wanted to try out
just the basic so learning how to use
the SM 8800 learn how to use that seven
to 20 get some baseline efficiency
numbers that were confident in and start
playing around with voltage ripple and
now we have a whole list of things to
improve on so keep an eye out as we
continue to advance that methodology but
you are very much going to be watching
us learn this process because the the
power supply reviewers that are out
there now have been doing it a long time
are very good and we're not gonna start
at that level but we'll work towards it
anyway next item
so gaming shipments actually there's a
couple before this one
more interesting let's let's move this
running around DRAM market here's a good
one
so for memory price we've been talking
about this story for like a year now at
this point and it's interesting because
the DRAM market continues to level out
this is a good thing and this is after
multiple quarters of record high prices
and an ongoing price-fixing
investigation which we reported on about
a week or two ago as the Chinese
government has reportedly said actually
not it has literally said that it has
quote massive evidence regarding the
price-fixing investigation but again we
don't know any more than that they
haven't revealed any of the evidence and
and we don't know what direction it's
going but what might interest you to
know is that memory prices keep seeing
updated predictions for continually
lower prices and now DRAM exchange which
is one of the most reliable sources for
these price updates is citing that first
quarter 2019 could yield another 10%
drop in desktop memory prices prices are
trending downwards thanks to the market
being at an oversupply while
manufacturers continued to increase
output
additionally the demand for DRAM has
been sluggish the last couple of years
demand has far outpaced supply that's no
longer the case the us-china dispute is
also expected to impact the cost of
shipments but it's a bit nebulous what's
going to happen to memory as it stands
in the update we looked at in about
October the price of memory was not
supposed to be impacted by tariffs it
was one of the few electronic items that
would dodge those new US tariffs and of
course whether that impacts you were not
somewhat depends on which continent
you're in if you're in Canada you might
still be affected depending on where the
product comes into port but DRAM was not
on the list initially we're not sure
where that stands today because that's
been updated recently so we'll see what
happens in 2019 but right now it's
looking a bit better and you can check
one of our previous news items for
plenty of other discussion on this topic
in fact if you go back in time you can
you can firmly see the mood of the
comments and of me presenting going
about like that as people talk about
whether the price is going down or up
again Intel debuting 10 nanometers wait
what we just talked about seven
animators Wow Intel's got its
nanometer stops tone production DV + UV
teams were working in tandem with one
another and for the 10 nanometers stuff
here so crimson Canyon knucks the next
unit computing next next something next
unit of computing next unit of computing
it's been a little while had look it up
so in town Lex crimson canyons up next
following the hideous Canyon one that we
actually built in one of the boxes
actually here it is right here so this
was a really cool product we did some
sort of extreme overclocking on it put
liquid metal on it and the water block
in a custom case and that's what's left
of it still works out so this is being
followed up by the new Intel nook which
is crimson Canyon and previously Intel
worked with AMD on at-ats Canyon part
you'll potentially be happy to hear they
are doing it again we're happy here that
because Hades Canyon was one of the best
products that Intel has put out recently
and was a lot of fun to work with and
very good in both CPU and graphics
fronts so crimson Canyon narcs are
popping up at us retailers now like
Amazon Newegg and Walmart also be an H
photo the two new SKUs are as follows
there's the Nook 8i 3c y SN and the Nook
8i 3 c ys m so there's a two differences
these feature and Intel Core i3 8121
which is based on Intel's law and
awaited and sort of existing ten
nanometer process and the fact that US
retailers are reported as having wide
availability is a good sign here that
Intel's approaching volume shipments of
10 nanometer in some form which they've
said is on tap for 2019 a couple of
years late but it is probably coming out
in dollars pairing the 8080 121 i 3 cpu
with an ante radeon 540 d GPU and that's
got 4 gigabytes to 8 gigabytes of
soldered lpddr4 2666 memory accompanied
in it both parts that is the mini pcs
are equipped with a one terabyte SATA
drive but will also come with an m2 20
to 80 slot for additional storage if you
need it or a PCIe SSD
connectivity comes in the form of Intel
wireless AC 95/60
that's 800 2.11 AC Wi-Fi bluetooth 5 and
it's also got hdmi 2.0 outputs price
starts at five hundred thirty dollars we
might try and look at one of these
because we did like the hades canyon
parts so these would be good follow-on
to that next up Seagate announced that
the company currently has a 16 terabyte
H AMR hard drive and testing for an
eventual enterprise release the 16
terabyte hard drive is heat assisted
magnetic recording and is based on
Seagate's exos line-up and enterprise
storage separately and exciting for data
enthusiasts Seagate is looking forward
to using H AMR to reach 20 terabyte
levels by the year or by the end of 2020
like most of the high-density mechanical
storage out there the 16 terabyte EXO's
devices use helium to increase the
quantity of platters but Seagate did not
disclose exactly how many platters
they're using to achieve 16 terabytes
that will very likely be revealed soon
after Seagate validates and qualifies it
strives internally we'll be moving
forward with production first deploying
the drives to customers in data center
segments where they could really use
some more density and Seagate recently
released their EXO's X 14 14 terabyte
hard drives this past September actually
and also has the arrival of the EXO sha
mr16 terabyte devices looking towards
well sometime soon at least for data
centers so that will officially be the
largest hard drive available usurping
the throne from Western Digital is
existing a 15 terabyte drive named the
ultra star DC hc6 20 C gates got an
official blog post on that if you want
to learn more but as always we'll have a
link to our show notes in the
description below next up this one this
one's kind of kind of special so gaming
gets a shout-out you might make fun of
how products for names gaming X gaming
why gaming Z but it matters apparently
so gaming monitor shipments doubled in
2018 apparently thanks to pub G and
fortnight if you hated those games well
you can thank them for bringing volume
shipments of gaming monitors and thereby
potentially reducing the price going
forward now if you're wondering what
does a gaming monitor what does that
mean what is a gaming amount of matter
well according it to wit's view which is
a division of trend force which works
with DRAM exchange and produces some
actually very reliable data which view
says that by its metrics a gaming panel
is one that is identified as having a
refresh rate above 100 Hertz and which
view previously reported that gaming
monitors would exceed sales of 5.1
million units in 2018 an annual growth
of 100 percent year-over-year according
to the path or to the report recently
games like pub G and fortnight have
spurred new momentum within the PC
gaming sector this is particularly true
in Asia where internet cafes have
purchased new 144 Hertz monitors on mass
like in China
additionally curved gaming monitors are
seen an uptick to 50 percent market
share led mostly by demand from China
once again the report also suggests that
the popularity of games like pub G in
fortnight are making high refresh rate
monitors more appealing to quote common
players you might call them the the
dailies or the normies if you prefer and
this is largely thanks to these battle
royale games so a lot of the products
that heretofore were considered normal
are now beans laughs with gaming labels
of course and looking at the jump here
in sales it's actually a good thing for
the industry especially for those of us
who might be interested in purchasing
more of those things in the future
because with volume comes a reduction in
price and then finally here we're not
gonna give this one too much attention
because it's old news by the time this
video goes up but of course the Titan RT
X was announced it was announced sort of
right in between our news cycles but
it's $2,500 card we are actually that
isn't one but we were we were not sure
if we would buy one or what the plan is
currently we're gonna wait and see what
happens on the sampling side and in case
there's any confusion Nvidia that's not
a Titan RT X Titan V so you can feel
free to send one along for review but if
they don't we will well we'll get one
and that should be fun to work on so
keep an eye out for
our coverage of that in the future at
some point if you didn't already know
Titan r-tx recycles the TU 102 silicon
use in the 2080 ti in our 2080 ti review
we talked about the the potential that
silicon and how just like with pretty
much any GPU that comes out it's not the
true big GP it's not the true big
touring part it's it's damn big but it
doesn't have every single SM enabled
there's a bit more there that you can
get with Torian including some more
memory as is evidenced by 24 gigabytes
of gddr5 memory on the Titan RT X and
that is enabled by adding the additional
one memory controller so RT x 2080 TI
has 11 memory controllers and the Titan
card will have all 12 of them and higher
density modules apparently so that's
what you get there it's got 4608 cuda
cores 576 tensor cores stuff we reported
on in the past when 2080 i launched
although we didn't have firm
confirmation that there would would be a
Titan we more or less speculated that it
would happen with those specs and here
they are so we'll look at it once we had
a chance otherwise as always subscribe
for more and you can pick up one of our
shirts we just recently restocked or the
GN blue beer glass with a gold rim on it
so check to store cameras excess net for
