the data you're looking at now this is a
chart that will dig into later but it
shows memory price trends for the year
so far we also recently had another
report on memory prices with five years
of price data and following this we set
forth on an information-gathering
mission to learn more about how much it
costs to actually buy different types of
memory as a manufacturer this allowed us
to look at just how much the memory
suppliers are making the raking and
record profits with record highs right
now for stocks you can just look at this
high necks or micron stock chart for an
idea of how much that is and how it
linearly compares with the memory prices
today we're talking about why and how
the memory industry is in the shape its
in before that this video is brought to
you by the EVGA X 299 dark motherboard
the one that we recently use to take a
top five world record for fire strike
overclocking results the EVGA x 299 dark
board is one of the best we've used
presently in this current generation and
it has a coupon code of gamers nexus for
a savings of $75 off for us customers
expires on May 31st you've been
interested in the X 299 dark with its
actual vrm heatsink and actual vrm
cooling capabilities that was a good
time to grab it use code gamers next to
that check out click the link in the
description below so this is part 2 of
our Ram report series if you want to
catch part one and you should check the
link we'll put it in the description or
in the corner or something in a card the
first part aired previously and ugh deep
into five years of memory price trends
working with PC part picker to collect
aggregate data all the way back to 2013
for ddr3 and ddr4 memory what we showed
was that in conjunction with the stock
price is the memory price is pretty much
rose at the same rate at the same time
funny how that works so that's what we
talked about there we could show some of
that throughout this video but you
should definitely watch the content if
you haven't today we're talking about
some more specifics so this is less
consumer facing memory prices and more
manufacturer phasing and manufacturer
for instance would be something like
Kingston crucial Corsair or even people
like EVGA and
a Seuss who make graphics cards that buy
memory often directly from these
suppliers
although occasionally from nvidia and
AMD who are also a to memory supplier
customers so we're looking at what they
pay and our previous Ram price report
showed things like ddr4 2133 for
instance costing the same today as it
did when it launched several years ago
so that's not really what you want to
see but GD d rh PM flash has
miraculously somewhat stagnated and even
begun to stabilize so that's an
interesting piece we'll be looking at as
well the actual cost of a memory die
seems like the best place to start our
story we're talking the cost that again
Nvidia AMD Corsair and all the other
manufacturers pay this is what the
suppliers sell it to them for modern
super fabs can cost upwards of 15
billion dollars and our multi story
fabrication facilities that are capable
of outputting 150,000 to 200,000 wafers
per month they're not fully spun up to
those speeds yet but SK Hynix does have
such a fabrication facility in Korea
Samsung has been working on building
there is an outfitting more cleanroom
space and this is something that's been
widely reported for a while now they're
growing through adding cleanroom space
and they're expanding their fabrication
plants a wafer is a horizontal slice in
a silicon crystal a mono crystalline
cylinder that gets cut into circular
wafers which are then diced into
individual dies you've often seen these
for Intel or and the unveils of new
products for example where they'll hold
up a circle that's very shiny and has
rainbow colors those individual dices
those are the dyes that go on to your
products whereas the circle is the wafer
SK Hynix is one of the leading memory
manufacturers and often the only
alternative to Samsung micron is also an
alternative but they sometimes compete
in different markets micron for instance
does not make HP I'm presently Hynix is
a new Korean superfab yields
approximately 150,000 wafers per month
at present and is ramping towards
200,000 eventually each wafer yields
about 1500 dyes and we've learned from
inside sources at the company that these
can be allocated to basically whatever
they want all 1,500
and then you have your yields after that
the 1500 dyes can be allocated to DRAM
flash G DDR memory or HBM depending on
what hynek's is building on that line in
the absolute best cases for a wafer the
companies can profit upwards of $8,000
for one waiver that's the best-case
scenario not every way for cells at that
they be trillion dollar companies
otherwise but the point is if they were
to sort of optimize a particular wafer
Ron for whatever customer is paying the
most they can make a hell of a lot of
money and that's at producing over a
hundred thousand wafers per month at
peak capacity let's get a couple of
memory module photos on the screen for
the next part and create something of a
table we know some prices here SK Hynix
negotiates prices with each company
individually for gddr5 memory at eight
gigabit per second speeds one of the
fastest pieces of gddr5 SK Hynix sells
it to GPU vendors and board partners at
about nine dollars per unit at least
that's what we've been told by close
sources om like Dell and HP can pay ten
to eleven dollars per unit easily and a
GPU might have eight of these on it
which instantly creates $72 of costs
it's no wonder that even the RX for 70s
and 570s have skyrocketed in price along
with the ten 50s and to some extent the
ten 30s that don't have the ddr4 memory
considered next that we know gddr5
memory prices were about twenty-five
dollars of lower for video card makers
last year for eight gigabytes when we
previously had insider quotes at around
$50 to outfit a card with eight
gigabytes of gddr5 this is reflected in
some MSRP s that have been officially
increased at this point as for HP m -
that's where it gets interesting you may
have noticed Vega is at limited supply
since launch there are two reasons for
this but we'll only get into one of them
today they got and Titan V both use high
bandwidth memory - or HBM - for their
frame buffer and memory supply and
adding to our chart now a stack of for
high HP m2 is sold for about $65 and AMD
uses two of those on its vagin 56 and 64
products that's 130 dollars of cost
right
there and that doesn't count the inner
poseur cost the inner poseur cost around
twenty to twenty-five dollars what we
understand and has its own yield costs
baked into that price as well plus
package yield costs and is all assembled
by a few different package assembly
plants adding again to the chart we can
list Samsung's HP m2 memory that's eight
high and Vidya is starting to transition
towards eight height stacks of HP m2 and
our understanding is that Samsung
charges upwards of $120 per stack for
these typically though Nvidia may get
special discounts of some kind for
perspective back when Andy began
planning its parts acquisition for Vega
video cards they were looking at around
and were pitched around $30 for a four
high stack of HB m2 it's considerably
more now more than 2x in fact and that
is an indicator of just how much the
memory market has changed in the last
couple of years doesn't have anything to
do with AMD
they don't make the memory but the point
is they were working on it figuring out
what memory to buy long before of course
we ever got vega cards in our hands and
that price changed a lot over the years
as for the forthcoming GDD our six
something we talked about at GTCC when
we were at an sk hynix booth of the show
that's looking like it's going to cost
about 20 percent more than gddr5 that's
straight from one of the manufacturers
or one of the representatives at a
supplier memory supplier so what you're
looking at there is if a vendor pays a
sweetheart deal price of nine dollars
for an eight gigabit stack of gddr5
eight gigabit per second to be clear
what they can expect now is something
closer to eleven dollars for a
high-speed at GDD are six piece of
memory the speeds are still somewhat in
flux depending on which manufacturer you
look at they have different specs so a
20% hike there it's supposed to come
down to 15% eventually 10% as the market
matures and more of the lines are
switched over to g6 but for now that's
what we're looking at as for DRAM this
is where we used our custom GN script to
scrape memory prices for the last five
months or so and we'll keep doing it for
the foreseeable future there's really no
reason not to so we checked prices every
single day for several kits on Newegg
and all
so checks supplier prices from several
different supplier price websites we
plotted an overall downtrend in price
for ddr4 2133 we can put that on the
screen now so twenty one thirty three
and twenty four hundred megahertz memory
and aggregate at eight gigabit and four
gigabit die sizes bought at a downtrend
overall that's good from January at the
beginning of the year we measured eight
gigabit memory at nine point six dollars
per unit dropping sharply in March just
like the flash that you'll see later to
nine dollars and fifteen cents and the
price then climbs a bit and flattens
it's down overall for the year but still
high the afford Gate memory fluctuated
more climbing inversely to the eight
gigabit memory in march for gigabit
memory went from five point two dollars
to five point six five dollars as a
reminder if you're putting multiple dies
on a stick of memory that can start
adding up not terribly fast at these
prices but certainly a few dollars
critically what we also know about DRAM
is that server and enterprise users
create all of the margin upwards of
sixty percent profit margins for the
suppliers people like hynek's and
samsung would much rather take the
memory you could use and sell it to an
enterprise company why should you have
it or why should we have it if they can
make sixty percent margin that's
capitalism although there should be
obviously some kind of protections in
there
but either way sixty percent margin is
massive and that's what they're looking
at for enterprise to be fair there is
some extra work done here for example
the enterprise companies and the server
companies get the highest value of the
premium real estate on a wafer the
center of the wafers the most valuable
there are potential lithography
limitations that may result in lower
chip quality towards the perimeter of
the wafer and so the companies get the
first crack at the middle of it that's
part of why it's cost priced higher it's
prime real estate so this type of memory
might be towards the edge is
unacceptable for server use but it's
perfectly fine for people like us for
enthusiasts that does not however change
the fact that more and more of the
wafers are being allocated for higher
margin divisions
or higher margin companies that have
applications in enterprise server and
b2b scenarios so it's the outer edges
that get used for something like flash
dram or G DDR memory
speaking of flash our sources have also
informed us that flash memory is one of
the easiest products that these
companies make to sell and using our
script to scrape daily price as a flash
supply for the past five months we
plotted this chart this is an average
daily high price for 64 gigabyte 32
gigabyte and 16 gigabyte flash we
plotted an average selling price for ASP
of 4.8 dollars to four point eight five
dollars for 64 gigabytes from January to
March in mid-march we saw a sharp down
tick to the tune of 5% rivaling that the
previous down dick we saw dropping to
four point five dodge this has since
begun trending back up for a 32 gigabyte
flash we observed relatively flat line
performance at 3 dollars 15 cents us
dropping at the same time as the 64
gigabyte flash down to 295 the 16
gigabyte flash went up 14 cents in march
then dipped back towards $3 flash memory
has been somewhat stabilized a much
different behavior than what we've seen
in dram flash memory manufacturers have
finally come to consensus on moving to
3d NAND or VNL end and have largely
consolidated on 64 layered designs
although hynek's is moving into higher
later accounts than that this
consolidation of technology has allowed
flash memory to reach a more stable
output as the R&amp;amp;D process to develop
multi-layer v-nand designs cost
production resources during the period
of development for one final chart
here's the consumer facing aggregate
prices we scraped data for about a dozen
kits of memory over the past 5 months
and we combined the kids at various
speeds and averaged them here the green
line represents high speed at 16
gigabyte kits overall we're seeing the
ddr4 3030 200 mega Hertz pricing for 16
gigabytes fluctuate the most wildly it's
sitting presently at an average between
our small sample size of about two
hundred and four dollars the year
started with them at 215
spiked to 250 dollars and has come down
more recently for 8 gigabyte kits of
various speeds represented by orange
blue
and red lines were seen some fluctuation
with the recent downtrend for eight
gigabytes 24 hundred megahertz by ten
percent
we also monitored a similar $10 though
not 10% reduction an eight gigabyte 3030
200 megahertz memory it's still about
two to three times what it used to be
and what it should be but it's
theoretically dipping at least that's
what you could think based on this we
don't have enough long-term data to know
whether this is a temporary dip or an
ongoing trend you have to treat it like
a stock chart we don't really know where
it's going we don't know if this is just
part of some tiny dip that's brief or if
there's actually a downtrend in price
which unlike a stock chart is probably
something you want to see the new
class-action lawsuit also obfuscates
thins and complicates pricing mental
games so we'll see if that impacts
things probably much much later in the
future and one final important note here
as memory demand has continued to climb
and as these companies have expressed
limited cleaner and space issues it
seems that the objective of some of the
companies has changed micron has
publicly stated as we recently discussed
in our ram supplier class-action lawsuit
discussion micron has publicly stated
that the company is no longer interested
in gaining market share not something
you hear a whole lot of when there's a
market with only three competitors and
you're not the biggest one but that's
not what they're interested in anymore
they're interested in max profit per
wafer to some extent you can't blame
them their company if they put in more
effort and they make less money per unit
it feels like wasted effort you'd see at
some point a crossover where for a
certain amount of minimum effort to
maximum dollars your company is the most
profitable that seems to be what they're
shooting for that is what they've
somewhat led on publicly and we could
connect the dots the rest of the way as
for whether or not that's legally
acceptable when you have three suppliers
who control nearly 100% of the market
we'll see that's for the courts to
decide and it looks like it's been and
where this class-action goes we should
at least have a response within the next
20 days or so from the memory suppliers
on that market of course they will
almost certainly refute it but they
should have to basically go line by line
paragraph by paragraph and highlight
each individual point in the HBS law
class-action filing which is presently
in complaint form no proof of wrongdoing
yet just to remind everyone I just love
to see where it goes the point is though
companies are making more money than
they've ever made before and if you're
wondering what it costs to buy the
memory for the products you buy now you
know it's not cheap especially with so
many modules on a single component so
with micron focusing on profits other
companies couldn't follow suit if not
already and with prices and speaking
with our sources at suppliers we've
learned that these companies as they've
told us are making more money than ever
before not really a secret with public
companies they also treat everyone who
isn't a server or enterprise company as
lower priority that includes ddr4 makers
one of the folks we spoke with who works
at a memory supplier didn't even know
who Corsair was so that just shows you
how far off the radar enthusiasts can be
Kingston sure there a server company to
a large extent they sell memory to
server companies but Corsair in the eyes
of some of these folks pretty small
company and a final note of optimism
here for you one of the things we
brought up with our newfound sources at
these companies was that some analysts
have previously projected memory prices
that's coming down towards the end of
2018 that statement was met with
laughter it's not going to come down in
that timeframe according to people very
close to the actual cost of these
products unless of course this class
action changes things but those are slow
and there's nothing concrete yet just to
complain so there's your there's your
inside for the memory industry you know
what it costs to buy memory now these
numbers we've validated in a couple of
locations with different different
sources at different companies and we're
pretty confident in them and HBM alone
is exceptionally expensive prohibitively
for some devices which would be why you
see the reduced quantity of things like
bago or at least the
higher prices for something like Vega
compared to gddr5 it's not like AMD is
trying to rip us all off it's that they
are being forced to pay a lot of money
for the memory that's going on it more
than they planned for same goes for
things like the Titan V although it's
expensive for other reasons probably
because it miscalculated its own price
but that's all for this one subscribe
