of coolers this is the X 42 this is the
140 millimeter version of the cooler
they've also got a 240 and a 280 prices
are all over the place but the 140 model
that we have here the X 42 is priced at
$130 X 52 is a hundred and fifty dollars
it's 240 millimeter rad and then if you
got extra money 160 for the 280 this
thing is primarily interesting because
it's got a full RGB LED controllable
backlight behind the pump plate and this
does have an infinity mirror in it as
well so it is one of the most
aesthetically advanced I suppose liquid
cooling solutions out there on the
market at least for a CLC but we'll talk
about that more in a moment first all
this coverage is brought to you by an
tech and a new qubit mini ITX case
designed by Razer which supports full
custom loop liquid cooling we're still
waiting for the other two units the 240
the 280 to come in but today we're going
to tear this one down and look at the
internals because it's actually a bit
different from previous ace attack pumps
this is a Gen 5 is Dec pump and a lot of
this design as we understand it was
actually by NZXT so to my knowledge this
is the first AC tech product in the
consumer side of the market that has a
PCB and electronics inside of it that
were fully designed by the partner in
this case that's NZXT rather than by ASA
tech so that's new the LEDs as I said
are also new they've also kind of gotten
a bit smarter with the cables there's
all modular cables if you noticed unlike
the previous cracking coolers where you
had a huge web of cables sticking out of
the thin and they were not optional now
you can connect your disconnect
including this USB cable this is a mini
USB and that goes straight to a computer
so you could plug it into a laptop even
and still control the LEDs even though
it's not actually cooling anything pumps
powered by this there's a SATA power
connector so your SATA power as you
would use for an SSD or hard drive you
plug the SATA power in there and that's
how this is powered but that is it for
the connections and then other features
sort of on the outside before we dive
into the teardown these tubes you can
see now swivel this the
not happen with the fourth gen a stack
pumps or the 4.5 gen this is a 5th gen
feature and that's done just really by
having an elbow here and then there's
probably we'll see when we tear down
probably another elbow in there like
that which would allow this action other
than that it's the normal Barb's
it's got fancier to be nice opposed but
it's still the rubber tubes that a stack
uses the closest comparable competitors
on the market would be Corsair so
they've got the H 100 IB 2 that is also
a Gen 5 pump and then if you look at my
notes here there's an H 115 I with a Gen
5 ace attack pump but this is much
different and that's in one way just the
tubes they don't come straight out the
top of the thing they come out of the
back then up and then also the LEDs and
all that are completely new
so let's tear it down this is the Kraken
X 42 model you can see we've got the
bottom just as always would be it's got
pre-applied thermal paste your copper
cold plate the rest of the the bottom
bracket there and then your mounting so
we're going to start with unscrewing
four of the outside screws I haven't
taken one of these apart obviously it's
brand new so we will we'll learn as we
go and just a quick note if you think
about doing something like this yourself
just know going into it you're probably
destroying your cooler you could
technically probably refill these well
that is a giant screw but I don't know
that it would be too successful never
tried to refill a closed loop it is just
a propylene glycol in there though okay
so standard cold plate copper cold plate
with the removal of those screws we can
now pull this apart a lot of foam
padding in there no liquid yet so that's
good
there we go there's a better view of the
inside so foam padding this gray thing
sticking up is actually if we wash this
off I think you will see that it is
probably a diode of some kind covered it
in a ton of thermal paste yes so this is
actually a diode it sticks way up and it
goes through the inside of this you get
this stuff out of the way so this is
going into into this hole that's also
got their own base everywhere that as I
understand it should go straight into
the liquid so this diode should actually
be able it's a thermocouple it should
actually be able to read the temperature
of the liquid and it goes way in there
so that's actually theoretically good
news because on this particular model
all the new Krakens you can control the
pump speed and the fan speed
independently if you wanted to do such a
thing but that's that's the first part
of this taking apart I don't know where
these cables connected we're going to be
able to disconnect them or not
but we can try I guess I think we'd have
to get in under here to take them apart
and there are three more screws in here
so unfortunately for us these wires are
soldered on each end which means there's
no good way to disconnect them without
destroying them don't do I have wired
sorry guys
brand-new cooler and it's ruined but
yeah that's we got to see how it works
and I've already I've got others coming
in for testing so this will educate us
more in the long run what we've got here
is the diodes sticking out that goes
into the lower chamber to test the
liquid temperatures the cables that were
soldered here are for the LEDs and power
or things like that this PCB is pretty
complex actually this is designed by
NZXT
not by ACE tech so that is interesting
and new let's take this apart okay talk
about that in a moment at that moment so
for the the PCB because this is the main
point of interest basically a small way
for cheap PCB in terms of just the
thickness but you don't need a thick
like overclocking PCB that'd be silly so
what we have is a an RGB LED controller
of some kind and then on this end which
is what shines through this thing here
with the infinity mirror effect and
there's some LED light tubes in there
I'll talk about later so on this side
we've got one two three four five six
seven eight three six eight at least
eight LEDs in this circle some of them
are side flare type LEDs but those are
the main ones in the center and then on
the other side oh yeah we've got your
power ground all that trouble on the
other side you can see the USB connector
the SATA connector the diode and the
and the controller which is stm32 if
anyone cares to look that up and that is
an F 103 C 8 T 6 with a bunch of other
things in there
my is 604 something like that so that's
the controller the LEDs all control
through here is pretty complex little
board for a liquid cooler this is the
cap that sits between the pump and the
infinity mirror all goes like this
something like that anyway and then the
part to talk about here I suppose is
just the mirror so this is pretty basic
stuff if mostly probably know how it
works one mirror on the outside another
one lowered down and it creates the
effect that there's multiple strips of
light in there and then you can actually
just this is the whole ensemble right
here you just move it around it come out
go that'd be cool cool that's kind of
neat this is your NZXT logo with one of
the mirrors behind it and with a light
tube so there's one light tube and then
it just looks like a bunch of them
because again the mirrored finish on
each side so that's what we got
internally for the actual hardware
here's another PCB this is the base PCB
it's the simpler one this is the one
that does all the heavy logic with the
LEDs and it is actually pretty complex
as you'll see in the software when we
review these things this is the one from
ASA tech but it is again all kind of
designed by NZXT with this particular
product so that's the base PCB you'd
find that in pretty much any gen 5 pump
it might have some modifications I'm not
positive but let's see if we can start
taking this apart find out what's under
there ultimately we'll have to take the
cold plate out to see see how the liquid
flows and things like that ok so it goes
that PCB that thing is very tight very
thin not much to talk about there here's
your motor this one's got one two three
four
five six seven eight little coils in it
so I don't know if that if it's an eight
pole or what but it's pretty powerful
looking the magnetic motor should be
using a bigger screwdriver head for this
but you get the idea this comes out I
can actually see the liquid in there I
don't know if that's visible there it is
there's your liquid this screws got a
rubber stopper on it to prevent it from
coming out I'm not sure if this screw
has to come out to remove the stuff
we're doing next so I'm actually going
to put it back in for now and if we
can't get it apart then I'll take it
back out later that's just to simplify
so I know all the liquids coming out of
one place I think next we just have to
start taking the rest of it off there's
your mounting your socket plate I won't
need that currently so take that off
this is all connected it looks like so
next thing is to start taking these out
but these I really have to get this
screwdriver size right on this is
they're very very thin and unforgiving
mother okay
okay there's one it's going to strip
now gamers next a showerhead sort of
really tempted to start going the
brute-force like pull it out with pliers
method
Oh
no it's holding us oh there's a screw
got it hidden screws okay there's
another part there's where the that 90
double elbow I talked about is so elbow
one elbow - that's what allows the
swivel while also being pushed outside
of the pump rather than out of the
straight out of the top like the Corsair
Gen 5 units are so we are done done with
this half of the unit this can go away
for the better really so if I drill
through the head of a screw
something went over there it's still
holding this on
got all the heads of the screws huh
there we go
look at that I'm sure it's exactly how
they disassembled it at the factory so
what we've got is uh basically these
these okay few things these screws are
really soft metal these are extremely
easy to strip I knew that going into it
fortunately I also don't care so that
means that there's really no downside to
you know try and try every screwdriver
I've got easily accessible and if it's
still strips then screw it we'll just
well not screw it we'll do the opposite
we'll drill it so that's that's what we
ended up with plates obviously babette
bent for my endeavors but you get the
idea the format here is the same as the
other ASA tech pumps in the past so
basically you've got a little cover here
that goes over the micro fins explain
this many times before if you've heard
it I'm sorry but basically there's ton
of micro fins in here and there's little
channels on the sides the liquid goes
through the fins like this so the bottom
of the plate touches the component CPU
or GPU conducts the heat spreads through
the fins you want as much surface area
as possible to dissipate the heat most
efficiently and then liquid goes through
the fins carries the heat up and out of
the tubes and this basically helps with
pressure helps keep the pressure high
through those fins you can see that the
two pieces go together like that
so that's how they meet and that pretty
much handles the the cooling aspect of
it there's channels way in here both
sides down there down there might be one
other one definitely down there and
that's where you get the liquid coming
back up and out of these in and out of
these tubes or I should say these sort
of barbs or barb housing anyway so that
is the let's let's rephrase that that
was the crack and x42 NZXT I'm sorry a
pretty cool engineering though so again
this is kind this is kind of the most
important or most interesting aspect of
the whole thing
this is NZXT ease design PCB with the
LEDs on it and a nice circle pattern
emits that light pretty evenly through
the mirrored finish and then you've got
some side lights as well things like
that we'll have more coverage of this
thing though in terms of like actual
cooling performance pretty soon I've got
all three units coming in testing versus
the H 100 IV 2 which is the direct Gen 5
competitor and the some of the other
stuff predator 280 from ek so that's
what we got for you patreon like the
postural video as always if you would
like to help fund the purchase of more
screwdrivers that are good for this I
mean we I have a lot of screwdrivers but
very weak screws and not quite a perfect
fit alternatively if you'd like to fund
the purchase of a new whatever this size
drill bit is because it snapped at the
end so yeah that's a that's our content
thank you to our sponsors for paying for
new drilling I will see you all next

I'm going to get out of here before I
hit my head on this see you next time
