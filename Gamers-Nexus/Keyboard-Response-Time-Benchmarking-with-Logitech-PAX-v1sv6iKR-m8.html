now this is our second video for the
show we're at the Logitech G suite and
the show looking at some of the keyboard
timing testing that they have here
similar to the Mouse timing test we saw
last year but simplified in a great deal
and a number of ways that are actually
helpful to us because maybe this is
something we could replicate in the
future in our own lab before we get into
this content it is brought to you by
EVGA and the GTX 1080i CX cards like the
ftw2 that we tested recently you can
also find the 1080 Ti shortly probably
the next month or so
playing the description below for more
information on that so let's get to this
first of all we have the new keyboard
this is the Logitech G Pro keyboard
we'll have information on that in the
article below the competing keyboard or
at least the comparative one is the
razer blackwidow tournament edition and
what we're doing is pushing a giant red
button to get a delta in the response
time between the keyboards so how does
that work well we push the button we see
that the Logitech one of course tends to
be winning by a couple milliseconds
that's why they would want to show us
this but they also want to show as last
year that there's no funny business
going on so we have one of the modules
here the black box with the button on it
that is torn down and what we see is
when I push this button what's happening
is that's being fed through here the
obviously disconnected on this one that
feeds through here goes into a
breadboard up here and through a timing
circuit that is event eventually
connected to a Raspberry Pi 3 that's
what's underneath here so that feeds
through there is a timer to make sure
that when we push this button the signal
goes out simultaneously to both
keyboards so it feeds out through the
front of this which would be right here
through these cables and these are
connected to the L key on the keyboard
so it's basically simulating pushing the
L key through an electric switch that
way there's no human error when pushing
the key if you were to test it man
we could also do but there'd be human
there so there's really no point
so that feeds into the keyboard fires
the Alt key then comes back out through
USB beaten and the Raspberry Pi is able
to say which one was first so it sets
basically sets a flag almost like a
keyframe when you push the button says
this is the time it is comes back this
time it was when it came back and then
you get your delta which is here I don't
have an absolute time for you in terms
of how frequently or how fast these
things are in absolutes
it's definitely below 50 milliseconds
the deltas there now one thing to
clarify here is response versus report
times and rates so when you're talking
about report or poll rates you normally
see something like the thousand Hertz
thousand times per second your mice your
keyboard towards them advertise 500 a
thousand Hertz that is the report rate
or the poll rates this is the response
time so they're different if we push a
key here it has a response time it feeds
into the system and eventually gets
reported to windows now unfortunately
even though you're being pulled a
thousand times per second that doesn't
mean there's new data a thousand times
per second what it means is it's getting
pulled and it might miss one of those
cycles and so if you missed the cycle if
we miss by 10 milliseconds we have to
wait for the next poll does it matter
that's hard to say because ultimately
we're talking milliseconds here for
actual pro-gamers people who aren't me
maybe it matters I couldn't tell you but
what we can't see is the objective
difference between them and at least a
delta value through this breadboard and
Raspberry Pi setup which is at least
pretty cool we saw that with the more
advanced version for the mice last year
if you want to check that out we'll
leave a link below and as always an
article below for more information
subscribe for more patreon.com slash
gamers exit alles out directly we might
look into something like this in the
future I'll let you know thanks for
watching I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
