roundup we're looking at the last week
of a news items in the hardware industry
including some updates to bios for
motherboards with octane support
primarily EK water blocks sk hynix
developing GDD are six and then a couple
of topics on monitors peripherals things
like that before getting to that this
video is brought to you by the current
bundle on the gtx 1060 and GTX 1080
video cards where you can get Ghost
Recon wildlands or for honor at checkout
this comes alongside new MSRP is for the
GTX 10 80 series cards now down to $500
you can learn more at the link in the
description below
following MSI and gigabyte asus now has
a BIOS update for their motherboards
primarily the be 250 q - 7 th - 70 and z
- 70 lines which basically all of them
for octane so if you were planning to
buy octane ACS now has a BIOS update
that will support it you will have to
install windows fresh to get that
working which is a bit of a downer but
that's what you have to do so octane is
supported on ACS now it's also being
added to asrock boards so as are
following Asus you can find those
updates on their official websites the
asrock update applies to its 200 series
entirely enables the octane memory which
is that $44 m to stick you plug into
basically front-load your primary drive
and that's on the asrock app shop which
is their website their name for the the
downloads so octane by the way we have
kits for it we're working on a review
this is one that I wanted to push obtain
our review of it past embargo letter
ones because it's different enough that
it required some new testing methods and
things like that so we're looking at it
it's going to take a little bit of time
to figure out where it makes sense
because it's not necessarily in
enthusiast applications but we will have
tests eventually for opt in in other
news though EK the water cooling company
has new monoblocks so EK is the first
company to launch a monoblock for the am
for socket and that is compatible first
with the ROG crosshair six hero
motherboard which is one of the main
ones we've used for our risin
testing we have plenty of shots of that
board if you wanted to see it the block
uses a nickel-plated electrolytic copper
cold plate and that has an acrylic top
so because it is 2017 of course there
are RGB LEDs in there as well overall
though you get a water cooling monoblock
4 amp or sockets with some RGB stuff if
you wanted an acrylic top so you can see
what's going on in there so that block
is $137 they've got pre-orders up not
sure that we're going to be reviewing it
though I'm sure someone will have videos
out there Jay maybe ek plans to start
shipping that on May 12 and then they've
also got model box for the ACS 200
series motherboards not just AM 4 here
this is going to be compatible with the
z2 70 Maximus 9 apex the ROG is e2 70
Strix mini ITX board and then of course
that crosshair 6:04 am for they also use
a nickel plated electrolytic copper cold
plates with an acrylic top and those are
going to be priced at 137 for the m9 a
aboard that's the apex unit and 137 for
these tricks RGB board as well also
shipping on May 12 in memory news but
not system memory news for once SK Hynix
one of the world's biggest manufacturers
and suppliers for actual memory dies the
tips that go onto the video cards and
other things like memory modules they
are working on G DDR 6 so they're
planning to have that ready and entering
into production around 2018 that's when
mass production is supposed to start
they're working on eight gigabit GDD are
six modules first and they will be
joined by Sampson and micron who are
also working on GD r6 and have stated
that they are working on GT d r6
the JEDEC group is still deliberating
over the exact spec for DDR 6 though SK
Hynix
allows it their GD dr6 memory will
operate at 16 Giga bits per second per
pin which is the faster than the gddr5 X
speed of 12 gigabits per second per pin
additionally running on a 384-bit memory
bus SK Hynix is new memory is allegedly
capable of a 768 gigabyte per second
bandwidth this is in comparison to the
500 gigabyte per second bandwidth of g5x
from micron depending on if you're
looking at the ten eleven or eleven
point four ish gigabit per second
modules from micron and that memory is
supposed to reduce the voltages by about
ten percent over g v not g 5x next news
item is CPU coolers so these are air
coolers don't hear too much about those
these days FSP known for power supplies
almost exclusively is now getting into
the air cooler market and they're doing
that with the new wind ale coolers they
have when Dale 4 and when Dale 6 models
coming out
these are solderless designs so they're
assembling the actual heatsink the thin
stack and the heat pipes without solder
which is supposed to improve the
transfer though that's always hard to
tell until you actually test it if it's
actually gonna be useful the window for
uses for heat pipes as the name might
suggest and the six uses six heat pipes
and those are both 120 millimeter fan
coolers with a 60 CFM FM stock that you
can throw your own on there if you
wanted to FSP says that the wind ale
four can handle a 180 watt TDP and the
wind al six can handle a 240 watt TDP
which is fairly high in terms of CPU
cooler specs as advertised anyway both
coolers are supposed to be that 160
millimeters tall which makes them about
10 milliliters taller than most of the
coolers we've looked at recently
including those that are more compatible
with the kind of small form-factor boxes
so these are going to be a bit tall for
those when Dale 4 is going to be priced
at 33 dollars and six at 47 dollars
making them competitive with the cryo
rig and hyper 212 and the therm will
take contact while though a bit more
expensive in peripheral news we posted
an article on the site this week about
razors new lancehead Mouse they've got a
wireless version that is competing
directly with Logitech G and 900 they're
aiming for an eSports audience where you
care more about weight and mobility
Razer didn't really provide us with too
many technical details so far that we've
posted them all on the website and the
article if you want to check that out
you can find the news at link below
there's also a wired version of the
said which we have discussed more in
that article another peripheral news
that G school has a new keyboard it's a
tkl keyboard so it's got 87 keys and
it's the km 560 we don't have a price
for it today the km 5 6 you will have
Cherry MX switches they will be red
brown or blue depending on your choice
and in terms of LEDs it's just static
red LED backlighting no RGB is here to
be found you can adjust the brightness
and lighting effects that's something
we've seen in the past several times
normally using Hardware switch is like
an FN key combo to do that there's no
additional ports on it so no USB
pass-through nothing like that it's a
pretty playing keyboard other than the
LED backlighting and tkl assets so that
is a TBD on pricing and release but look
for the km 560 from g.skill in the
future Silverstone has got a new case it
is the VT 0 2 mini STX case following
their traditional theme of using names
that no one can remember the VT 0 2 is
built for HC PC users and stream setups
so just a small streaming box it is
comparable somewhat to an Intel nook
form factor and that is sized at 6.5 by
two point nine ish by 6 inches with
height depth and Silverstone says that
the new chassis will accommodate Intel
stock coolers that you could also use
some of the small profile coolers that
are on the market if you wanted
something like that the VT 0 2 will have
2 2.5 inch SSD bays probably don't need
a whole lot more in that form factor 1
USB 3 type a 1 USB 3.0 type C it's nice
to see these are new trends for the K
smart board that finally starting to add
type C to this n1 was among the first
last year at Computex they've got audio
jacks as expected so - 3.5 millimeter
CPU clearance is 46 millimeters not very
tall - tall enough for a stock cooler
and then it's also got interestingly a
mounting plate so they've got a vase of
supported mounting plate you can mount
it to the back of a TV or monitor if you
wanted to if it also had a basis back
support for backside mounting so pretty
cool stuff that should be around 32
dollars current availability
unknown but that is the silverstone of
et0 too many STX case if a CPC is of
interest to you very quick honorable
mention for a sir here they had a press
event about a week ago end of last week
and they announced a lot of new monitors
among them were 144 hertz panels so if
that's something you care a lot about
look into that a sir the predator z2
seven one UV and the X 27 would be the
models that probably our audience was
most interested in including the X 27
which is a 27 inch IPS panel at 4k
resolution with a 144 Hertz refresh rate
and Nvidia g-sync and HDR 10 and tobi
eye tracking and a 400 millisecond
response time so that is the flagship
it'll be expensive but I go Google for
that one because it's it's interesting
stuff to look into if you care about
monitors that's all for this week as
always you can help us out directly on
patreon.com slash gamers next to
subscribe for more or gamers Nexus
botnet to follow this stuff as we've
posted throughout the week thank you for
watching I'll see you all next time
