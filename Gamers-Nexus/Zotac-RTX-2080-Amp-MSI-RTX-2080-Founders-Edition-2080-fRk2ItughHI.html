at Gamescom we were able to see a couple
of other video cards for the new Nvidia
r-tx series on the show floor that
includes the founders edition design
from Nvidia MSI's dual fan card and then
a ZOTAC three fan card so these three
are the others that we saw at the show
aside from EVGA s solutions that we
already detailed there are three of
those two before that this video is
brought to you by thermal takes view 37
case the vo 37 focuses on highlighting
custom PC builds with its full panoramic
window and tinted front acrylic and our
thermal testing the view 37 performed
reasonably well when considering its
looks focused build which is partly
thanks to the airflow design and the
removal of a bottom power supply shroud
for a balance of looks and performance
check the link in the description below
for the view 37 let's start off with
Nvidia's reference card this one the
biggest change is the dual fan cooler
with a vapor chamber covering the entire
lower part of the card this of course
completely obstructs air flow to the PCB
the result is that anything which lacks
direct contact the vapor chamber will
run hot as it won't have any airflow at
all in theory anyway the reference cards
that two fans are also spaced very wide
apart which is something that we're
curious to look into later the card is
completely enclosed with minimal space
for warmed air to escape the periphery
of the video card forcing it to escape
out of either just the back or a couple
of side ventilation boards and Vidya has
a lot of distance to go to really make
this design competitive despite the
company citation of a quote one-fifth
noise level of the original blower note
also that decibels are logarithmic and
that 1/5 the decibel level assuming
we're going by pressure is closer to 3
dB regardless it should be quieter that
much is for sure and the GPU will need
all of that extra cooling this is also
the only card which is allowed to have
an env link connector cover as we
understand it today industry sources
have indicated to us that Nvidia
restricts the NV link covers to the FE
design and then it's also got 2 by 8 pin
power connectors which you can see on
the edge of the card but the power
balancing between each header
improved over the previous generation
from what we understand as well
interestingly and Vidya is also using a
synchronous fan control something that
EVGA designed with icx we're not quite
sure what the relationship here is if
any or if there's any agreement in place
but EVGA does hold several patents
pertaining to its icx asynchronous
cooling moving on to msi shown
prominently at the HP booth where the
company intends to use the new nvidia
r-tx graphic solutions and future omen
obelisk systems the MSI card in terms of
looks is pretty similar it deviates the
least from the reference design or the
founders edition design thus far but the
cooler itself is substantially different
we can immediately spot for heat pipes
at the right side of the cooler which
indicates that Emma size portrayed card
is sticking it with a more typical heat
pipe based design rather than using the
board covering and expensive vapor
chamber that Nvidia is using on its EFI
card this is the first non red and high
card and some time aside from a couple
of duke cards and fits the NVIDIA theme
extremely closely including some green
highlights very atypical for MSI these
days from what we've heard part of this
has to do with limited partner time to
wrap a product and MSI is likely to come
out with full custom PCB solutions and
custom cooler solutions at a later date
past the launch of most of the cards the
fans are the same diameter or very close
to it but do have a 14th blade to the FE
is 13 and they do use Emma size more
traditional fan design likely provided
by power logic finally though tax amp
gaming 2080 was on display at the case
king booth where we previously detailed
all of this generations EVGA cards the
zotac card is significantly different
from reference and the card we just
showed from MSI but it does still look
like a reference PCB underneath at least
it does for right now there's a chance
that ZOTAC makes a custom PCB later and
this might just be for show due to the
extremely limited window where partners
had almost no information really so tack
routinely makes some of the least
effective coolers of a given mass but
there's time yet for that to improve
with touring for large heat pipes like
the 8 millimeters our larger hand over
the edge of the PCB where half of the
rightmost
also over Haines we were able to spot
several large thrown paths between the
PCB the baseplate and the cooler which
does indicate a potential improvement by
ZOTAC over the previous generation with
the 1080 TI series cards so this is
something that's good to see but ideally
those pads aren't quite so thick they
look close to two millimeters and we'd
rather than be closer to 0.5 or 1.0 as
it's more optimal for efficiency either
way it looks like a potential
improvement for ZOTAC but we won't know
more until testing and then finally most
of the PCBs you'll see at launch will be
reference PCBs even if they have a
custom cooling solutions but custom PCBs
will come later
just to clarify those previous thoughts
the 1 to 3 month window that we heard
originally was for Foley custom
solutions whereas you should be seeing
some reference PCB solutions with some
sort of custom coolers at launch with
the nvidia efi card it's just that
there's full custom solutions will come
a bit later because they didn't have
enough time with the spec to build out
the card so that's what we know for now
for the other 3 cards at Gamescom that
we were able to find we've seen 6 now
