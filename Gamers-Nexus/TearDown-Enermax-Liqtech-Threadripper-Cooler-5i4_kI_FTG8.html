are going to be doing a teardown of
another liquid cooler today this time
it's the enter max TR for lick tech
cooler that's used for thread Ripper the
reason we're taking this apart is
because it's the first liquid cooler of
its kind to really exist purpose-built
for thread Ripper and as such it's got a
larger cold plate the question is once
you're inside of the actual pump housing
does the cold plate protrude into micro
fins across the entire plate or just
over the die coverage area have they
repurposed the pump from a smaller unit
that's what we're gonna be trying to
answer today but before we get into that
this coverage is brought to you by
ifixit.com and their protec toolkit i
fix it as refreshing their protec
toolkit in time for the holidays you can
find a link in the description below to
the protec toolkit and other toolkits
that iFixit sells we find the protec and
essentials kits to be the most useful
for DIY enthusiasts ok so we've already
benchmarked these we benchmark the 240
on the 360 previously they perform
pretty well actually and now we just
want to learn what's inside and if the
pump housing has been repurposed so to
do that it's got tortes
heads in the entire cold plate all
around the cold plate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10
of them and also we've got two large
Torx screws here which I think are
basically fill ports and these are more
meant for the RMA Department then for
people like us but it's nice to have
access to them if you want it to prolong
the life the cooler by refilling it once
there's some permeation so first we need
to remove the mounting plate which is
done and then we've also got Torx screws
in the top for the LED plate the
nameplate I'm not sure when we're gonna
have to remove those and let's I'm gonna
start with the fill port or what I think
is the fill port because I want to just
empty as much of the liquid as possible
that's always the biggest pain with
doing these is the fact that they have
liquid in them so we'll start there try
and get as much out as we can and then
go through the rest the kit that I'm
using right now I think is the 64 bit
kit not 64 bits like computing
sixty-four as in that's how many bits
there are in there you know let's just
remove one of these this I think is a TR
20 that we're using right now so it's
pretty mad as the first time I've had to
use that one and okay that's been
removed so I'm thinking liquids just
gonna kind of come out at this point or
is it blocked off more than that you see
a drop come out yes yes okay that's all
you got oh and ER Max and coolermaster
are the two that use a like a neon toxic
green coloured what I would assume is
propylene glycol that's what everyone
else uses typically it's a clear fluid
but they might just add a dye to it oh
there we go that one came out with a
stopper or with an o-ring okay that
should that should help toxic green if
this comes out of you there's a problem
hey I think we pretty much got it okay I
put it down and a bunch more it's gonna
come out
almost exactly 200 milliliters so if
you're gonna completely drain and refill
one of these yourself it's looking like
about 200 milliliters you probably want
to fill a little over that because I had
a couple drops miss and there's place
some more in there
so maybe call it like 225 or something
to be safe but it should be pretty
obvious once it's fall anyway okay so
I'm gonna plug those back up and then
start taking the cold plate off and then
we'll move these again if we have to
it's possible that they need to come out
for disassembly so let's just dump this
into the larger one for now and now for
the cold plate
you are 9 I think is what we want pretty
good maybe a 10 let's try it 10 it's 20
for the big ones on the sides 10 right
here I need a bit more torque than that
we're good
hopefully this is easier than the
easytek ones the esoteric ones are a
nightmare to get the cold blade off
because they're so torqued to prevent
leakage and they use well they might not
use fewer screws but the placement of
the screws and the torque plus the
softness of the screws means that it's
very easy to strip them and at that
point you basically have to drill it out
but this looks like it's assembled in a
way that you should be able to actually
use their services if you wanted to I
don't think they encourage it or suggest
it but it's probably for RMA purposes
and then that benefits us as well
Wow that's a very wide channel rubber
gasket over it that clear thing is or
maybe a silicone that's like a rubber so
we've got a gasket and discolorations a
little interesting I'm not sure why it's
discolored you see that a little bit
maybe maybe someone with more materials
experience can tell me what that is and
why it happens and if it matters the
discoloration we're seeing a little bit
of yellowing on the edges though of the
copper so yeah copper coal blade is that
just like there's like some gunk in
there a little bit of gunk but nothing
that's gonna really affect performance
in a meaningful way that gray stuff but
the interesting thing it is actually
more or less the full size of the cold
plate that's not what I was expecting to
be honest I thought there's gonna be
like a repurposed micro fin array from
one of the smaller plates which would
cut off around there so it does I
actually take the full surface area for
the most part you've got channeling on
the sides for liquid flow the gasket
helps with well actually I guess the
channeling on the side is not for that
that is it is for the oh no you get some
liquid through there but it's mostly for
accommodating the gasket which helps
with increasing pressure of the liquid
moving through the micro fins so that I
can get through there more quickly and
deal with any potential impedance from
things like these gunked-up fins which
I'm not sure why they're like that but
let's take a look at this okay so you
can see part of the impeller in there I
think the rest of its inside the rest of
the housing and we've got in and outlets
over here and then the micro fins
obviously in here with more of our
discoloration on that side so let's
let's see if we can take apart the rest
of this and gain access I don't this
looks kind of like a machined
Laak so maybe we have to go in through
the top which isn't gonna be a different
size break into this one
yes tr6 is what we want is that small
just sounds like chemical you smell that
right top of the letters toward the
cable okay top two letters toward the
cable I will not remember that here we
have the PCB obviously so this thing
this isn't just me trying to advertise
for them
we've had these kits since iFixit first
ran ads with us and I don't know if this
comes from them I think it yeah it does
because this has a magnet icon in it so
I only just discovered this like a week
or two ago there's just a small magnet
kind of you get this magnet on a stick
for your car and this is the first time
I've gotten to use it which is always
amusing to actually have a use for a new
tool nice okay sweet so there's the the
impeller is going to be in here oh yeah
I can actually see the impeller now cool
we'll get to that in a second and got
the PCB which is controlling your LEDs
the RPMs rpm temperature response stuff
like that if they have fed in here and a
big ol ring in there which against so
against the o-ring you can see it's
brace in on this bit of the housing the
plastic shell around the impeller
magnetic there you go that looks
familiar it's magnetic its polarized as
all all pumps are
you pull it off and there is the Impaler
which actually looks pretty similar to
stuff that Dyna Tron makes I don't know
actually who enter max the supplier is
for this this is leading me to think
maybe Dyna Tron but I'm not positive
pretty similar to the old Dyna Tron
stuff romantic 12 50s though so yeah
there's there's our impeller it's got
some grooves on the outside where you
can see basically the blades so you can
see the grooves where it's pulling and
pushing the liquid got some more in
there so in this in the current state of
this liquid cooler we can actually
reassemble it and still use it which is
really cool because there's another
content idea there typically when we
disassemble these things it requires
destroying stuff and this one if I
wanted to I could get under here but I
don't want to there's no point it's hot
glued on you can actually see the hot
glue around the edges so I'd have to
start pulling it apart further I don't
want to break the bond on these cables
and underneath all you're gonna see is
the electromagnet you can actually see
some of the copper down in there so this
it's just an electromagnet in there it's
nothing special we've shown them before
so we're gonna stop there for this
cooler let's make sure there's nothing
else on here that is we're seeing
they're not really this is just I don't
know if I'm not sure what they used to
make this housing here you guys someone
someone else can tell me for this
housing does this look like machines CNC
diecast you know what's the appropriate
term for this so if you look at it it's
pretty much a unibody I think for the
most part yeah so it's I mean it's
either way whatever the approach is and
I'd love to learn more about it the
assembly is pretty high-quality we
already tested it for thermals perform
as well noise noise normalized
performance is good and now you can see
how it all goes together
and other than that I mean yeah this
would be trivial to refill so that's
pretty much it for the NR max lick tech
cooler actually I could refill this with
its own liquid I guess we wanted to it's
a bit contaminated but from going in a
bowl it's been used before but we could
do it if we wanted to because this thing
I'm actually kind of excited to try and
refill and use because we every time
we've taken apart the haze attack ones
you could refill them but it'd be a real
pain to do it and it's probably not
really worth it most of time we've had
to drill apart the cold plate as well
because there's screws strips so easily
but this thing came apart easily there
is a little bit of stuff in the micro
fins but it's only a couple spots it
kind of looks like they're all paste so
I don't know how much of that got in
there just from me handling it because I
always have their own face on my hands
versus how much was in there already but
yeah if you needed to service this unit
and refill it or something would be
pretty easy to do so and the micro fans
extend across the whole service area of
the plate so that's really cool too
so that's all for this one as always you
get a patreon.com slash gamers nexus it
helps out directly or you can go to
store die cameras Nexus dot knives I
pick up a shirt like this one or one of
our GN stickers and again then get
