for the GTX 1060 and it's two SKUs and
the RX 480 and it's two SKUs those
videos are on the channel the articles
are online but basically they were for
gigabyte verse a gigabyte 480 and six
gigabyte verse three gigabyte 1060 today
we're taking the low-end SKUs of each
I'm doing a head-to-head directly
between the three gigabyte 1060 and
revisiting the 4 gigabyte R X 480 for
benchmarks in games before we get into
that coverage this content is brought to
you by an tech and the new cube mini ITX
case which is a small form-factor
enclosure capable of fitting a full
custom loop and you can learn more in
the link below to quickly recap the
differences between these two cards and
what we're calling their base models
that would be the 6 Evo by an 8 gigabyte
versions the gtx 1063 gigabyte is the
card that we already looked at versus
its 6 gigabyte alternative and basically
said it should actually have a different
name and that was because this is more
than just a halving of the vram so it's
more than 6 to 3 gigabytes
there's also 10 percent fewer SMS which
means fewer course 10 percent of them
and you also lose some TM use as a
result of that so it is a slightly
different processor than what's found on
the gtx 1066 gigabyte card and the RX
480
on the other hand depends on what model
you're buying this one is a bit more
variable because they having partners
have some say and pre over clocks things
like that but the base model which most
of the IB partners are selling obviously
you've got half the vram 4 gigabytes the
only other difference is a slower memory
speed so this one operates at about 7
gigabits per second whereas the 8
gigabyte model is always at 8 gigabits
per second or there abouts so those are
the differences for the most part the
memory speed doesn't impact too much and
some games like doom we actually do see
a difference but it's not too common and
then the SM performance is going to
impact everything so testing methodology
is defined in the article links in the
description below if you want to learn
about how we tested these cards for the
1016 the 488 we used a stock card for
each of them so stock clock rate 1708
megahertz and then stock clock rate for
the 480 as well it was not modified we
didn't use a B partner card so these are
basically
box obviously and I know this and many
of you will point this out a B partner
cards for either one of these could be
pre overclocked and that would impact
performance pretty heavily in clock
sensitive games we're doing stock cards
if you want to look at a B partner model
performance relative to other cards on
the bench you can check our reviews of
the individual cards MSI is EVGA S or
whatever other partner you may be
looking at so links in the description
below for drivers test methodology and
previous content on the rx 488 versus
for gigabyte in 1063 where six gigabyte
getting to the benchmarks though Gears
of War 4 is the first on our bench this
is a Windows Store title that operates
on direct x12 which we've recently
tested in a separate benchmarking video
and article across multiple GPUs we have
to use present mom to test this game
that is built by Intel Microsoft hooks
into the system pretty directly and then
we leveraged our own in-house scripting
to analyze the frame time data this
produces the usual 1% and 0.1% low
numbers that you're used to it from our
content at 1080p with ultra settings the
GTX 1063 gigabyte card operates at
nearly 115 FPS average with 1% low
performance at about 87 fps and 0.1% at
about 76 fps the RX 484 gigabyte unit
performs at nearly 104 FPS average
pretty close but about 10% slower than
the 10 63 gigabyte card and sustains it
lows with tighter timing than the
head-to-head competition that set at
this frame rate throughput the
differences are largely inconsequential
moving on to 1440p Gears of War 4 at
Ultra remains playable on each device
though frame rate is dragged down to 75
average on the 1060 and the our X 480
down to 68 FPS average the low
percentage performance is just shy of 60
FPS on the 1063 gigabyte but the output
is tight enough for each device that the
perception of the fluidity of the frames
is largely the same with each GPU that
said the 1060 is the victor in this
particular benchmark performing
approximately 10% faster than the rx 44
gigabyte card and we'll move on to doom
to see if that changes anything
we tested doom with both Vulcan and
OpenGL API as well start with OpenGL
results at 1080p at the GTX 1063
gigabyte card is coming along at 112 FPS
average for doom with 76 FPS 1% low and
66
understand low performance the RX 484
gigabyte meanwhile is hitting playable
framerates but sits far behind what the
gtx 1060 is capable of the RX 480 is
operating that around 80 FPS average
with low frame rates timed tightly and
around 60 FPS so that's a good thing and
a 1060 is a clear winner here but if we
switch to Vulcan things change a bit
with Vulcan at 1080p the RX 480 is now
just 3 FPS behind the gtx 1060 and both
are performing effectively equally when
looking at gameplay at frame time deltas
and frame rates overall this lens the RS
40 is just a couple percent off of the
1060 if you're running an RX 480 and
doom obviously it's time to switch to
Vulcan 1440p with OpenGL shows a similar
disparity between the GTX 1063 gigabyte
and Rx 484 gigabyte cards as in the
first test and swap into Vulcan again
changes our output to be pretty similar
between the two with 72 FPS average on
the RX 480 and that's just marginally
behind me gtx 1060 each card produces
exceptionally tightly timed at low
values with a Vulcan also a trend
between 1080 and 1440 with black ops 3
at 1080p high settings we're seeing the
RX 484 gigabyte card leave the gtx 1060
card by about 14 fps and the averages
though Andy does have less reliable
frame time performance the variance in
frame times occasionally manifests
itself in stutters during gameplay they
don't happen every single test pass but
they do happen somewhat sporadically and
this is more of a driver sight issue
than a VRAM issue since the GTX 960 3
gigabyte does not exhibit the same
behavior and we've already seen this in
the past when we did our initial 4 verse
8 gigabyte our X 480 benchmark this is
where you'll have to make a judgment
call because the our X 480 does have
better overall FPS than the GTX 960
objectively when looking at the averages
but the occasional stutter will impact
gameplay and whether or not you care
about that it's sort of up to you though
it's one of those things where the
stutters are not too frequent you'll
definitely still see a few per match if
you're playing the game regularly at
1440p we're seen similarly variable
performance with occasional stutters but
overall superior framerate throughput
the GTX 1063 great white card
gap is approximately 11 FPS average
favoring AMD or about 16.5% again in
favor of the RX 484 gigabyte card for
the average FPS stutters are a pain but
can be somewhat compensated for with
settings tuning it within black ops 3
moving on to GTA 5 at 1080p we're seeing
a performance throughput of 89.3 FBS
average on the 1063 gigabyte card versus
80 3.7 on the RX 484 gigabyte card the
low performance is greater than 60 FPS
for 1% values on the 1060 with 56 FPS
0.1% low performance the RX 484 gigabyte
is using its now fixed GTA 5 driver
update so this is not the drivers that
it launched with where we had some
issues with GTA 5 that puts the card at
50 7.7 FPS average for 1% lows or just
below 54 0.1% lows the 1440p performance
shrinks the gap a little bit as we're
becoming bound elsewhere in the system
by what these cards are capable of doing
and the GTX 1063 gigabyte operates north
of 60fps for its average with dips
tightly timed and around the 50 FPS mark
the 484 gigabyte card is also around 64
this average though it's low performance
dips down to 36 fps 0.1% lows in some of
the more abusive scenarios for the
benchmark so again we're looking at an
event where basically Andy's got some
driver kinks to work out to hopefully
improve the low frame time performance
in the future Mirror's Edge catalyst is
an interesting test case because we've
seen some issues with lower vram
capacities when testing hyper settings
in the past our main test is still with
ultra at 1080p and the GTX 1063 gigabyte
card leads marginally with 2 FPS gap
that is effectively invisible to the
players so this is really not of any
consequence and what's not invisible is
the frame time variance again frame
times our gapped enough on the RX 484
gigabyte card that we're seeing less
than 30 FPS and the heaviest stutters
remember it's that frame to frame Delta
that becomes observable as a stutter in
gameplay and that creates the more
jarring throughput in terms of your
frame rates and have fluid they look the
same is true for a hyper settings though
you're really not going to be playing
with hyper setting on either card
because it's far too VM intensive and
just taxing on the shaders in general
the GTX 10 at 63 gigabyte card generally
at least in these
Gamze has more consistent frame time
performance than its direct competition
the rx 44 gigabyte card in the past
we've shown some games like Assassin's
Creed syndicate where you'll actually
see a difference in performance based on
vram and VM consumption we did not have
those games here because we've already
looked at them and this video is
obviously for people who are already
looking at these two specific devices to
buy if you don't know about what I'm
talking about
basically Assassin's Creed syndicate and
a couple of other games we've seen black
ops sometimes 1440p will have results
that have poorer 0.1% low and 1% lower
performance and that's a result of VRAM
being eaten up and the cards basically
cashing out for lack of a better phrase
but you can learn about that more in our
previous content so the 1060 here does
have generally more consistent frame
times but the AMD are X 480 is a very
good competition and that is especially
true in doom when enabling Vulcan if you
feel like overclocking you could do some
changes obviously to either one of these
devices to make it a bit better still
but that's something we're not really
going to look at too heavily because one
already looked at the overclocking
performance in our reviews and two if
you overclock one you might as well
overclock the other and we're going to
end up with more or less the same gap
because the overclock in Headroom is
marginal at best for both and that also
depends heavily on a be partners and
things like that which we're not looking
at today so performance overall the RX
484 gigabyte has better average
performance in black ops 3 despite its
worst frame times you'll have to decide
if you want to deal with the stutters or
if you want to tweak your settings to be
a bit lower in some cases for black ops
3 to be more fluid but that's one case
where this is better and called duty
does generally have a bit better
performance on AMD then we've seen in
other games compared to Nvidia so that's
one use case for doom again it comes
down to if you're using Vulcan or not
Mirror's Edge we see some of the frame
time performance issues coming out with
the RX 480
but you can dip your settings down to
compensate and then other games like
Gears of War 4 which is a DirectX 12
title do allow AMD to stretch its legs a
little bit and improve the frame time
performance because it is a newer API
and AMD tends to do well with the low
overhead api's that are starting to hit
the market now each device can handle
1080p with Ultra settings and really for
the most part they can handle 1440p with
higher Ultra settings as well
so they're both good cards in terms of
their $200 price points and it really
does just come down to that price the
our X 480 isn't a bad option despite its
frame timing consistency compared to the
GTX 1060 which is performing pretty well
here but we were able to find both units
available for $200 or $1.99 there abouts
the RX 470 is also worth a consideration
if you can find one for 180 or less
because that's really the only point
where it competes but that is a good
alternative if you're trying to save
money 1050 Ti will be reviewing it soon
and we've already announced its specs
posted them from Nvidia's announcement
this week so the GTX 1063 gigabyte
despite our issues with its naming and
market positioning as described in a
previous video is doing well for its
unique price position and the our X 480
does okay you may want to do some memory
overclocking though if you're playing
Doom but otherwise that's what we've got
for the data you've got all the numbers
so I'll let you make your decisions from
