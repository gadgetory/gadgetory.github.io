nexus donna and we are checking out
forced today which is a cooperative
arena based brawler really it's just
it's pretty straightforward you kill
things in an arena and you hey guess
what i'm going to say you'd not die just
as always so once again our objective is
to not die and level up our character a
little bit whoa whoa what is going on
there look at that torso action this guy
i don't know i don't know guys I I see
no way possible to lose if he can do a
full 360 like that he must have a
gelatin spinal cord so I I've already
completed the first mission here and the
tutorial so we are gonna dive into
something a little harder I have not
played these other ones let's give
tremors a try because jumping into
something that's difficult always sounds
like a good idea when you're when you're
playing a game fresh so the most
appealing aspect of this game is by far
its co-op element however multiplayer
co-op is not currently available local
co-op is and i will get someone to i'll
get dr. gone over and we'll play that
sometime but for now we're doing single
player so we need to pick some pick a
skill we have a comma comma a high skill
here that will knock back enemies and we
have a shield throw so as you can see
here I've already selected a weapon when
you enter a challenge it puts you in
front of these four weapons the shield a
hammer that is on fire and that hair is
on fire why am I using a shield if I can
use a hammer that's on fire okay there
we go oh man that looks awesome what is
this flame nado that sounds pretty sick
I didn't read what it does but it sounds
good so he also have a bow ants
Wolverine claws but no one cares what
those because we have a hammer freaking
on fire seriously can't go wrong okay so
i'm not sure our objective is on this
mission other than to kill things and
survive but let's see interrupt the
spawner shrine is
the spawner shrine it looks like it yep
okay so that little ball that's
following me is is a spirit of some sort
we can call him by double-tapping space
and he will go to the region that I was
last in when I called him can also a
single tap space and he'll out a follow
and a lot of the game revolves around
using this spirit ball to interrupt
objects just like that so it seems on
the surface like something that is not
necessarily all that awesome however in
a later level that I will show you in a
moment it is actually quite interesting
because they really amp up the
difficulty and the and the stress placed
on the player by the challenges so
having that extra element just just
having this ball to keep an eye on to
kind of keep in the back of your mind
while you're playing and to
strategically drop it in places is a is
a significant amount of extra work oh
that's the flame NATO oh man it is it is
a like a tornado and it's on fire so
flame NATO seems quite fitting if you
ask me okay we killed the brawler what
now kill swarmers and kill brawlers so I
was saying the strategy in in our spirit
placement here it's actually quite
interesting it's pretty simple in these
initial levels because this is a very
early dev build of the game or pre alpha
or something along those lines I think
it's an alpha build but it does get a
little bit more challenging in later
missions of course this is only the
second mission now co-op each of you can
play different classes it is it is a
more tactical really than anything it's
not like turn-based but it is pretty
tactical because the idea is of course
that you will combine your abilities to
deal with these hordes of enemies which
do do become quite overwhelming if you
are if you are cornered or otherwise not
prepared for them so definitely
something to keep in mind there let's
enter up this spawner so what I'm doing
here if you haven't noticed is I am
continually attempting to interrupt this
spawner here by sending the spirit
through that's buying me time between
spawns so it is preventing more of these
swarmers from spawning so that lets me
deal with primarily the brawlers which
are of course much larger as you can see
on the screen here and a little bit more
medicine they look kind of like like
nacho libre if you that mask reminds me
of not you know they're not so menacing
when you realize that jack black with a
giant sword I suppose okay just kidding
jack black guys giant sword does 30
damage apparently which is quite a lot
of damage in this game so I'm in a
little bit of trouble right now but not
to worry because I have a hammer that's
on fire and once again simply physically
impossible to lose when you have a
mallet that is bigger than your body and
is made of lava so defeat the shield
brawler there's I see a shield and I see
a brawler I suppose that's a shield
roller I'm really low health right now
kind of sketchy not so sure what I think
about this he's flanking me he was much
smarter than I thought uh this is bad
this this well I paid for those of you
who are free hood viewers this is not
anything abnormal for our stream here
dying is something that I'm quite adept
at actually and it is it is an acquired
skill in these games it takes it takes
much training and I mean like that now
you couldn't die that spectacular i'm
just saying that was pretty good of
course the objective here they there is
actually a bug right now I want to call
attention to hopefully the developers
see this that said failure it was
supposed to say success because we're
just gonna say that's what it's supposed
to say let's jump in oops
same level let's jump into the harder
level I wanted to show you we will jump
back to the preparation room or actually
jump back to the Hall of trials excuse
me and we are going to jump into one of
the hardest challenges because if I
can't beat level two or three whatever
that was then surely I should be able to
beat level five right i mean that's just
logical so we will go in here i'm
actually going to try a different weapon
to switch things up the Wolverine claws
I'm not a fan of the animation they're
kind of strange looking it's a little
bit choppy and I'm just not a fan of the
weapon in general so I'm not gonna use
it the bow is pretty simple I really
point shoot right nothing nothing
revolutionary there however I am a big
fan of the shield so far let's see what
skills the bow has so we have a Chain
Lightning arrow the town's actually that
sounds pretty good jumps between targets
marks targets oh yes you can mark
targets by hitting them sort of like I I
really hate to it excuse me make this
comparison but D&amp;amp;D 4th edition actually
has market marking targets as well when
you hit a target it will put a mark on
them and using your abilities like this
one those can take advantage of the
marks so this it says well jump between
mark targets within 3 meters of each
other and deal damage to each of them so
this will be quite good if I get swarmed
and out and overwhelmed however it is a
bow so the obvious disadvantage there is
that in general it's just slower it
takes more time to fire a name and all
of that I would really like to try the
shield as you saw i want for originally
and i think i think i want this because
if i recall it has yes it has a lower
cooldown hitting an enemy will decrease
the cooldown let's see so there's our
progress not quite another level yet and
I don't have anything to unlock these
yet either so we are just flying with
the shield and are one ability here
let's dive into this level so this one
uh-uh it is kind of scary looking you
can see we clearly have Cylons operating
what looks to be a giant Goblet of red
wine and arcola is to disable that which
I have just done because the smoke is
damaging I'll let it let it get out here
for a second it will not I don't believe
I don't believe it will damage the
enemies however if I walk into it once a
dip you'll see it does to damaged me for
every x amount of time that I am in
there which is actually pretty bad
because of course as it gets farther and
farther out it is more and more
difficult to continually disable it
because you'll have to run wider circles
around the goblet as we have so adeptly
dubbed it to get your your spirit to go
through it and the spirit interrupting
it is how you disable it so this shield
I can block with which is part of the
reason I chose it because clearly going
all out barbarian mode with a hammer was
just too good they couldn't handle me
and I should probably kill that smokes
and I haha let's kill that smoke before
I continue with the with my thought okay
so we are in pretty good shape right now
only problem is of course we have some
spitters on the field which are arranged
enemies I believe if the name wasn't
indicative of that there we go this
doesn't do a ton of damage but as you
can see it knocks them very far back and
it sends me elsewhere so it is actually
very good for when you get cornered as
I'm doing right now by the way don't get
cornered um obviously I'm just doing it
you know to show you I of course because
i'm just i'm really looking out for your
best interests aha but you don't want to
get cornered so we're going to send him
through there again hopefully buy some
more time Oh what did that do I have no
idea what that did to be honest but I
think there's another one down here what
is what happens if I go through this
let's see killed that guy I think I'm
healing I was sick so you can heal this
game i actually did not know that
earlier that's going to make things so
much easier can't even begin to
explain how horribly are stewing before
without knowing that the combat is
pretty simple the gameplay mechanics
also very simple it does start to build
up of course as more and more enemies
come out oh crap I need to disable this
before it gets bad and it is getting
very bad right now oh come on come on
buddy you can run so I have to be
careful to make sure this ball goes
through because right now really this is
going to be my only shot here yep and
it's going to go through oh it didn't
reset it all the way so as you can see
here just like I was saying it builds up
and gets worse and worse over time and I
need to run on the other side
unfortunately I also need to heal so I'm
just going to try and confuse them by
running through all these rocks call him
here really hope he goes through it okay
and now I need to try and heal before I
die so hopefully he goes through that
and heals me Justin touch no no so close
anyway so that is forced it is pretty
straightforward you kill things and you
level up and with multiplayer I think it
will be actually very fun quite chaotic
of course it has up to 4 player
multiplayer and while i'm talking and
wrapping up we'll jump into another room
here has upped a four-player multiplayer
i believe and it is co-op so you play in
the arena together you complete the same
objectives all that I'm pretty I would
guess the difficulty would scale but you
can manually set difficulty I believe is
just I think you can't well maybe not
right now but i would guess you could in
the future so that's pretty much all
there is to it you run around the arena
you kill things it did just go through a
kickstarter campaign and i will link all
of that information in the description
below so if you like what you see please
like if you have any questions at all or
would like to recommend a game for me to
play you know if you don't want to buy
it you want me to take the hit for you
and check it out please let me know in
the comments and I will do that for you
and I will see you guys next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
