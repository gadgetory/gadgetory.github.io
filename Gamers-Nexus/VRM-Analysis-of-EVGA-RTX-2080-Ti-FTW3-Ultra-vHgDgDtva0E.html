hardcore overclocking and today we're
gonna be taking a look at yet another
r-tx 20 80 TI custom PCB though
admittedly I've done I think I've done
most of them on my own channel so the
like not that fitting but I've done a
lot of these at this point so I think
this is the only custom card I haven't
done yet so this is of course the EVGA
FTW 3 and personally for me the
highlight feature here is that this has
a BIOS which before that this video is
brought to you by Corsair Vengeance RGB
memory coursers vengeance RGB Ram uses
pre-screened ICS for better overclocking
Headroom and tighter timings courses Ram
also has the benefit of wide region
motherboard support by landing on
qualified vendor list for motherboard
makers and turned wide compatibility
between boards learn more at the link in
the description below ultimately I'm not
sure how useful it's going to be because
you can't mulder the BIOS on Nvidia
cards but you can you know experiment
with like using other cart like trying
to use a the the BIOS off of a different
card to try get the power limit or
something but ultimately all of the
biases are going to be more or less the
same because all of the biases need to
be approved by Nvidia and from what I've
heard Nvidia is pretty awful about
approving biases that do cool stuff so
yeah but it is a neat feature and yeah
like it is nice that you do have the
option even though unfortunately is
probably not going to be all that useful
to most people now then let's get onto
the probably the more interesting part
the RMS V curve erm is the pretty
standard layout for RTX 28 ET i where
you have one group of phases on this
side so that's that's one group of v
core and then you have the other group
of ecore over here so that's also V core
and above the larger of the two v core
groups we of course have the memory
power so V mm v mem is for powering all
of the I don't know why I can't write
tun M is for powering all of the GDD r6
memory chips around the GPU core then we
have a bunch of minor voltage regulator
that I'm not even gonna try to point out
on this card because they're they're
kind of all over the place and they were
really high hard to identify but uh the
card does ultimately need sort of the
following voltages it needs a pecs rail
and that's quite possibly generated by
this or this or it could be some other
thing that I'm not even noticing on the
card but that powers the PCIe interface
as well as some internal PLL's of the
GPU core then there's a 1.8 volts rail
which powers the BIOS chips that nvidia
uses as well as the VPP rail of the GDD
r6 memory chips so that's a supporting
voltage for those to function it doesn't
really do a whole lot if overclocking
wise it doesn't actually do anything
then we have also a USBC rail because
all of the 20 ATT eyes have a USB C port
so you need a power supply for that
because you don't get 5 volts for your
USB port from the PCIe slot and because
you really don't want to have the vrm
powering the VRM yeah there's a vrm for
the VR I'm probably like since you don't
want that one going down when somebody
messes with the USB port there's also a
separate 5 volts voltage regulator
located somewhere on the card probably
in this area though this is like that's
an input filter that's probably an info
input filter that's an input filter this
could be 5 volts this also could be 5
volts
I assume this is more filtering so yeah
really hard to sell like really hard to
identify these minor rails with just
pictures of the card so that's the best
I can do there but they do exist they're
scattered around the card they're not
really all that important now then I
guess let's get into the important V RMS
starting with the V Corps so the V Corps
here of course looks like a 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10 11
12 13 14 15 16 phase the issue is that
for some reason and I assume it has to
do with transient response requirements
but basically all of the r-tx 28 ET eyes
ultimately don't use any doublers and
instead what they're doing is what I
called ASIS out on for the on the Maxima
Silla
Maximus 11 hero where what they're doing
is essentially they take one PWM signal
from the voltage controller and shove it
into tube phases at the same time which
is why you have so many power stages and
inductors when the you p95 12 voltage
control are located on the back of the
card we're not actually gonna go there
because they're well we can go on the
back of the card it's just a bit blurry
oops
I've put too many divisions on that side
but the you p95 12 that this card uses
is ultimately an 8 phase voltage
controller so that's this chip right
over here and in fact because you uh
because EVGA has a nice and tidy PCB
here we can actually very clearly see
the current monitoring circuits which
you'll notice are one two three four
five six seven eight
I mean clearly we can blur Alesi them
but yeah these are the current
monitoring circuits and so basically as
far as this chip is concerned the vrm is
an eight phase-- and as far as the pwm
signals go it's also an eight phase--
because there's no doublers to shift the
pwm signals out of phase so ultimately
you have to power stages turning on at
the same time and therefore they're in
phase with each other there's no there's
no sense calling them separate phases
when they turn on at the same time and
this is actually what's going on with
act most of the RT x 20 ATT eyes now
there is a couple cards which do have
ten phase voltage controllers with ten
current monitoring circuits and you can
actually see that on them so those
definitely have ten phases but those are
also wired to look like sixteen I like
those also look like they're sixteen
phase or some higher phase count but
ultimately all of the the twenty ATT
eyes are running either
ten phases and the reason that these
cards don't use doublers because we can
kind of see that you know like on this
side of the card we have our six six
inductors and power stages here we have
the other ten located on this side well
we can see on the back of the card we
can actually see footprints for what are
probably doubler chips because there's
three of those one more down here and
another one down here they're
conveniently within the sort of distance
of the power stages and then on the
other side of the card we have this one
right here and this one and this one so
we can clearly see that somewhere along
the line somebody wanted to use doublers
and then they went like okay no we can't
use them for some design reason I'm
assuming it's gonna be due to transient
response because that's really the only
thing that doublers affect heavily well
relatively heavily you can try design
around it and ultimately GPUs are
probably more much more sensitive to
this than CPUs which is why it seems
that end video is probably requiring
that people just don't use doublers
otherwise I'm pretty sure a bunch of a
board partners would because if you look
at high-end 1080 T eyes there's doublers
freaking everywhere but with the 20 with
the the 28 et eyes nobody's using any
doublers because basically when you use
a doubler there's a couple nano seconds
of delay added to your pwm signals and
if you're just trying to match the
output the output voltage of the vrm
relative to the current pull of the GPU
core and you have a GPU core as large as
a what is it tu 102 pulling you know
limited to 200 and like the thing is
like nvidia gets most of their power
efficiency not from the actual
manufacturing process itself but from
really aggressive power gating so the
end result is that yes this GPU has an
average power consumption of something
below 300 watts I can't remember what
exactly it was but the peak and minimum
power consumption that the card will
pull are going to be massive
relative to like way off from the
average power consumption which means
the vrm has a lot of work to do in terms
of transient response because your
current draw is anything but consistent
and for that reason you know eliminating
the doublers makes kind of a lot of
sense from a design perspective for the
r-tx 28 for the r-tx 20 series of GPUs
because that is kind of like everybody's
doing it even the galaxy all of Fame
card which was $1,800 doesn't have
doublers so that's the only reason I can
think of that is like yeah you don't
want to use doublers now doublers do
have some benefits they can improve your
vrm efficiency because they can give you
the ability to properly current balance
all of your phases instead of just
trying to rely on the fact that as power
as power MOSFETs get hotter they go
higher resistance so like if this chip
gets you know if this chip is pushing
more current it's gonna be producing
more heat over time it's gonna get hot
enough that the internal like the
resistance of this chip is going to be
high enough that it's gonna push more
current into the chip that it's in
parallel with because these two will
probably be sharing a PWM signal so
it'll kind of self current balance but
it's not gonna be optimal and also your
with doublers you would have slightly
improved well slightly improved you'd
have improved input and output ripple
the thing is once you have eight phases
trying to go even higher on the phase
account and really like there's
diminishing returns
so going from eight phases to sixteen
the ripple and the output ripple
probably wouldn't change a whole lot so
there's nothing really wrong with this
being an eight phase but it's definitely
not so sixteen and my statement about
the founders edition in the past being a
thirteen phase is just straight-up wrong
that's also an eight phase and in fact
most of the twenty series is either on
eight or ten phases now then so that's
kind of the that's part of the control
scheme phase wise the you p95 12 also
introduces a two megahertz maximum
switching frequency which we cannot
access well actually we could if we add
a full datasheet for the chip because I
have recently gotten my hands on the pin
out for this thing and it is actually
very easy to vault mod and it should be
to actually physically set your modify
the load line with the resistor on the
GPU so that's pretty cool that should be
modifiable modifiable with a hard mode
as well switching frequency is actually
also set with a resistor however that
resistor also sets the address of the
chip on the I square on the SM bus
interface which is also you could all
which is also like it's similar to I
square C but you can actually use I
Square C as well for that but uh yeah so
ultimately you can't like while you know
if you have the datasheet it would just
be a matter of replacing one resistor on
the card and you could change the
switching frequency to whatever you want
which would potentially like well the
reason why you'd want to do that is if
you crank up your vrm switching
frequency you can actually reduce your
vrm output ripple at the cost of more
power powered more heat dissipation
because you're switching your MOSFETs on
and off more often in the power stages
so the power stages produce more heat
the vrm gets less efficient but you get
better output regulation so it's kind of
kind of how that works is it's it's a
fun fact vrm efficiency and vrm output
regulation generally don't go
hand-in-hand with each other like
they're there they're not necessarily
linked to each other but anyway this
does go up to two megahertz and it is on
the still on the PWM vid interface which
is the reason why it is so very easy to
hard malt this thing so yeah that's the
you p90 512 and it's basically a bunch
of bolt on upgrades over AUP 95 11 in
fact the pin out for this thing is super
similar to the u p95 11 which is also
why it's so easy to why it should be
relatively easy to modify now then for
the actual power stages on this card we
are looking at the ever-so-popular FDM
f31 seventies
these are pretty much the default power
stage for an RT x 20 series GPU
everybody uses them well not everybody
Asus likes to use they're more expensive
Texas Instruments parts but these are
relatively cheap they are very powerful
they do push 70 amps they are
so I forgot to mention these are smart
power stages not just any power stages
and the reason why these are called
smart power stages is because they
integrate current monitoring and
temperature monitoring and actually a
really like they also integrate
protections like 140 degrees Celsius and
I'm doing that wrong again that just now
this looks better to me I'm just gonna
do it that way I don't care which way is
the correct way at this point but 140
degrees Celsius over temperature
protection and 80 amps over current
protection so they won't allow you to
actually like overload them now the cool
thing is since there's so many power
stages here also this is one of those
things where if that 80 amp OCP kicks in
it'll force the current onto the other
Aldens of the other power stage in the
pair of two so it'll kinda like if you
were maxing out your your current
capability then they would actually
current balance themselves kind of just
bouncing off of the OCP there though if
they spend enough if they bounced off
that enough it'll eventually raise a
flag with the controller and the
controller will probably just shut down
the vrm at that point so it's not like
you can overload this forever but
ultimately since that trip point is so
very high and there are so many phases
you're never actually going to hit that
like there's no way you're actually
gonna hit that under normal applications
unless you try to like like well I guess
if you wanted to make like a low voltage
room heater with this VRM yeah you could
probably hit the OCP if you were working
on doing something like that but with
while powering the TU 102 core that
cores gonna die before the voltage is
high enough to push that amount of
current now then the end result of all
of these lovely power stages and having
this many of them in the vrm is that the
efficiency on this thing is pretty epic
so it's not the most efficient though
the the Texas Instruments parts are
slightly more efficient I think Infineon
also has power stages that are slightly
more efficient they're all rated as 7tm
parts
but yeah some of the competition has
slightly better slightly better parts
they're also way more expensive but
ultimately efficiency wise what we're
looking at here for a sweet VR I'm
switching frequency of 500 kilohertz and
a output voltages of 1.8 volts and 1.2
volts which I've finally gotten my hands
on a datasheet for like a proper
datasheet for a 70 amp power stage so
instead of scaling this off of like a
previous generation 60 amp power stage
which is what I did in the past this is
actually scaled off of a comparable kind
of part so this is now more accurate
than in the past and I think in the past
it was actually a bit low compared to
what what it's gonna be now so anyway
this is what the the datasheet of the FD
MF 31 70 itself is perfect for I can't
tell you what I'm scaling this according
to because that data sheet is nd aid now
then for oh yeah and well if runs off of
5 volts only so I'm not gonna mention
the drive voltage here so then for what
for the stock current level of around
like we're not like it's not actually
gonna run stock at 200 amps it's gonna
run probably a little bit more than that
but around 200 amps output 1.8 volts or
1.2 volts you're gonna be looking at 1.2
volts about 20 watts of heat and 1.2
volts at about 17 watts of heat honestly
with this many phases you could probably
like unfortunately the thing about all
pad like smart power stages and and
really any kind of power stage is that
everything has an efficiency curve that
looks like this and when you have 16 of
them you tend to be in this area at like
the lower currents now as you go higher
current the efficiency starts getting
better for the vrm but your overall
efficiency of the GPU is going to be
lower because it's gonna be pulling a
ton more power and not producing a whole
lot more fps so just kind of the Nate
well it's gonna be pulling
disproportionately more power than it's
going to be producing fps right like you
could get like a 20 well I don't I don't
remember how much these overclocked by
but let's say you gotta get a 10%
performance increase well you're
probably going to see more like 20 or 40
and power consumption increase for that
kind of performance increase but
ultimately the vrm is actually going to
be running a bit more efficiently at the
higher current outputs now for
overclocking on sort of water cooling
you're probably going to max out
somewhere around 300 amp range maybe a
little bit above that at that point the
vrm at 1.8 volts would be producing
about 30 watts of heat and at 1.2 volts
it would be producing more like 26 now
as we keep going up in current 4 at this
point I'm gonna say like sub ambient so
probably around dry ice levels you might
be looking at something like 400 amps of
current pole and at that point 1.8 volts
would be producing about 45 watts of
heat and 1.2 volts will be producing
about 39 watts of heat and the great
thing is even at this point you probably
would just get you you would probably
get away with just a gentle breeze over
the vrm without even needing a heatsink
on it to keep it from overheating
because that 39 watts is spread across a
lot of parts right like that is spread
across all of these power stages and
they're not even like in one big group
right next to each other so ultimately
the thermals on this thing are just like
this VR I'm if you're on like water
cooling you could totally you know if
you want one to water cooled the card
and you can't get like a full cover
block then it would be totally a valid
thing to do to get one of those GPU core
only water blocks you'd be fine because
the arm is gonna be completely fine
though the vram on the other hand that
might have a bit of an issue but the the
vrm itself is not gonna have a problem
with a sort of almost zero airflow and
fire almost zero airflow in environment
because it's just so massive overkill
for the lower current outputs here but
it is worth noting that at this point it
is very much like in the peak part of
the efficiency curve so that's kind of
why the like the founders edition it has
a 13 phase it nails the peak of the
efficiency curve at stock settings so
yeah that's kind of kind of the
reasoning behind why with a lot of the
28 ET Iser so it was so weird
in the vrm department now then moving on
from dry ice to more like liquid
nitrogen we sort of 500 amps and
possibly even 600 amps and you know off
the deep
just in case we're also going to look at
what would happen if you tried to push
700 amps though I don't think that you'd
ever actually hit this a completely
maxed out 1080 TI on ln2 would be
somewhere between the 400 and 500 amp
range I'm assuming a completely maxed
out 20 atti will be somewhere between
and I just screwed up my paintbrush
which is great will be somewhere in
between that 500 to 600 amp range so
yeah but this is just kind of like a
theoretical consideration and really
even this is mostly theoretical because
how many people are ever gonna run
liquid nitrogen on one of these now for
that 500 amp range at 1.8 volts you'd be
probably looking at about 60 watts of
heat of the arm vrm heat output so at
that point you might need more than a
gentle breeze over the power over the
phases and at 1.2 volts
it'll be producing about 52 watts and
yeah like at that point air flow would
be a good idea 600 amps you're gonna be
looking at more like 82 watts of heat
which yeah you're you're gonna need
airflow maybe even heat sinks but
probably just air flow assuming you have
a high enough rpm fan ultimately it is
worth considering that in extreme
overclocking the vrm is fine as long as
the benchmark finishes before the vrm
overheats so you don't even need to have
good enough cooling like you don't need
to be able to run the vrm at like 600
amps for an hour it needs to last for
like five minutes before it overheats if
it can do that you're good so even here
you could probably get away without heat
sinks and it's also worth noting that
the liquid nitrogen has a tendency to
freeze everything around the GPU core so
if the vrm is sitting I like if you're
just sitting the idle on desktop for
long enough over time the i/o section of
the GPU will like freeze over and so
will the like everything really all the
way down to the PCIe slot and through
the motherboard and yeah the longer you
run for and the more time
you spend sitting idle on desktop the
more frozen everything's gonna get
overtime so yeah like the VR I'm cooling
considerations on ln2 are kind of are
very different from like normal use case
scenarios now 600 amps 1.2 volts you'd
be looking more like 70 watts of heat
and the the airflows thing still applies
like this is a lot of heat at this point
and 700 amps output you're gonna be
looking at about about a hundred and six
watts for our 1.8 volts and about 92
watts for 1.2 volts so yeah at that
point is gonna be pretty like that's a
lot of heat but it's also worth noting
that you know at 1.8 volts output 700
amps you're gonna be looking at almost 2
you're gonna be looking at close to like
1.4 kilowatts of power right like 1,400
watts coming out of the vrm and the vrm
is only going to be producing about a
hundred and six watts of heat which is
still pretty good efficiency right ah so
yeah that's worth considering but at
that point yeah you will need the arm
cooling though of course this is even on
ln2 I don't think you're necessarily
gonna hit that
so the vcore erm and sort of standard RT
x 28 ET i custom PCB design fashion is
complete and ridiculous overkill for
what most people are probably going to
use it on which is going to be somewhere
in this range but yeah it's nice to know
that you know who you're there's no
chance of you ever overloading than the
RM on this thing and these do come with
a lot of safety features that include
functionality to like save the the GPU
core if the high side MOSFET or
something fails so even if one of one of
these breaks you're probably gonna be
fine with the VR like the VR I'm still
gonna be relatively functional which is
a really neat feature of these these
smart power stages now then for the
memory vrm we're looking at similar
levels of ridiculous overkill and
actually the memory vrm is weird a
little like very much kind of you know
it's in that part of the the efficiency
curve where it's like you
could probably get away with less phases
and not have any issues but the memory
of erm is a actual three phase you can't
you know do anything weird about that
the voltage controller for that is also
another you p90 512 except this time
it's running in that is not 95 12 that's
another you p90 512 right there that's
running in three-phase mode and same as
what I said for the one on the back this
one on the front is going to be very
easy to mod just because it's the same
chip so if you want to model your memory
voltage that's great news isn't it
though admittedly like that's probably a
great way to kill all of your GD dr6
just because gddr5 X also already wasn't
exactly tolerant of high voltages either
so yeah also the the voltage applied to
the memory chips that is also slightly
applied to the GPU core so you could
also break the memory controller so
again not the best idea to mess with
that for daily usage and then since this
is the sort of bog standard three-phase
memory power that we've seen on every
single RT X xx atti using the exact same
power stages as every other RT X xx atti
this also has the same exact efficiency
where it does 20 amps and we're again
talking about these operating parameters
20 amps output well except for the part
that we're only doing 1.8 volts cuz
scaling down to 1.2 volts doesn't work
at this kind of low current output level
20 amps output you're gonna be looking
at about two outs of heat which is this
is below what I think the G what as far
as I'm aware the GDD are six memory
chips should be pulling or it might be
yeah that that might be a bit low I
think they're more pulling more like 30
amps and at that point the vrm will be
producing about 3 watts of heat and at
40 amps output the vrm will be producing
about 3.5 watts of heat so yeah this
absolutely does not need any cooling
whatsoever
this is ridiculous overkill but that's
standard for these RT x 2020 ATT eyes
anything else I'm missing oh yeah we
have a whole bunch of circuitry on here
for car
monitoring and current balancing kind of
an interesting difference between this
card and a lot of the other cards is
that EVGA actually has an AI na 3 2 2 1
somewhere on here which is kind of a and
that's different because normally all we
see on 28 et eyes and really any twenty
series cards is the on semiconductor NCP
four five four nine one current monitors
and those basically take care of all
your shunt resistors so that's what's
monitoring those there's also I think
there's the one of the shunts is on the
back of the card and we have two of
those chips because there's also other
shunt resistors that need to be
monitored like I'm pretty sure that
they're like those are shunt resistors
as well that are also being monitored
and the reason why we have all of this
new monitoring circuitry on these cards
is because NVIDIA has per power
connector based power limits and that
means you need to actually balance your
power connectors if you don't want to
but bump bounce off the power limit all
the time which is something they've sort
of improved from the 10 series now if
you're wondering if AMD has the
circuitry MD doesn't have the circuitry
because AMD doesn't bother to actually
monitor how much current is going into
the card they just care how much current
is going through the vrm and that's
that's really the only thing they
monitor and more interestingly they only
monitor the power consumption for like v
core on most cards and on some cards
they'll also include the memory power
but the memory controller because AMD
has a separate memory controller rail
they don't bother with that one that
one's static that one's not monitored so
yeah that's kind of a the kind of an
interesting thing to consider altum
Utley Nvidia you know has all this extra
current monitoring and current balancing
circuitry just kind of because they're
really focused on power efficiency I
guess but it does really up the
complexity of the cards which is why we
have to NCP 445 for nine ones like each
of these can monitor for shunts so yeah
there's there there's a lot of current
monitoring going on on these cards the
other thing we have all over the place
is a whole bunch of like these random
while they seem relatively
randomly placed MOSFETs and those are
used for current balancing along with
like these inductors right here so we
have another one of those circuits down
here and that is taken care of by UPI
semiconductor U P seven six five six
five one chips and those just basically
choose which which power connector to
hook up to which which well like they're
they're gonna change with the power
connector that certain phases are
pulling their power from based on how
much power is being pulled through each
power connector so it's gonna optimize
that you like never exceed the 75 watt
limit of the PCIe slaw never exceed the
150 or like whatever power limit it is
that the eight pins each have so yeah
they can current balance all of those so
that you never act well so that you max
out your power allowance because
ultimately you're still get empowered
throttle at some point but it's gonna
reduce the amount of power throttling
happening otherwise happening compared
to what like the 10 series cards would
do so that's uh that's pretty pretty
neat and I've already talked about the
the sort of interesting phases on either
side of the GPU core layout in past
videos so if you want to you know find
out about that you can watch those and
for the oh yeah and for the shunt
resistors I've actually done a video
about how to mold these like really
advanced where you can completely
disable the power limit I'm not I'm not
talking like change the power limit by a
couple percent I mean no power limit
whatsoever so I've done another video on
that as well and I'm not gonna include
that because that takes a while to
explain so yeah that is the RT X xx atti
FTW three from EVGA it's a pretty I hate
to say it but it's basically a
bog-standard custom RT X xx atti as far
as I'm concerned the inclusion of the
bios which is nice I do really like I do
appreciate that quite a bit but
ultimately it's really not that
different from all of the other RT X xx
atti is out there the V RM is basically
the same
efficiency has everybody else the the
face count is the same as everybody else
the power balancing is the same as
everyone except MSI who somehow seems to
have gotten away with eliminating a
bunch of it but I guess that's because
they do have the extra six pin so yeah
that is the the FTW FTW 3 its it's
really good it's just not anything
special because they this is kind of
standard for RTX 28 et eyes but yeah so
that is it for the video thank you for
watching like share subscribe if you'd
like to support gamers Nexus there's
store gamers store dock gamers Nexus
dotnet or you can pick up things like
the mod map that you can see in the
background of the video here and also
shirts and mugs and other kinds of merch
and then what else is there we also have
a patreon so if you'd like to support us
through that you can there's gonna be
there's gonna be links to all of that
somewhere below with a video description
or comments as well and if you'd like to
see more overclocking related content I
have a channel called actually hardcore
overclocking where I do things like
explain how to do proper shunt mods not
just liquid metal or something like that
there's a better way to completely
disable the power limit and also mods
for the things like the you p90 512 so
if you'd like to check that out that
would be pretty neat and that is it so
