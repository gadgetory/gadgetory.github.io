and we were in a brand new space for you
so a little bit of back go in this room
it'll go down as we go through the rest
of this tour but sorry this is this is
brand new
I don't think other than an exclusive
flow playing video I don't think you've
shown it anywhere yet no we haven't
so the reason for that is that it's not
really in a state where we can show it
so in the future there's gonna be about
a thousand square foot workshop that's
gonna have our CNC router our upcoming
CNC mill we've got a lathe coming our
laser cutter over there it's gonna move
in there we're gonna have venting and
kind of like do everything more properly
a real workshop like a real negative
space so we're really excited about that
we're moving a lot of our storage over
here for events like LTX and the roast
actually hey check this out speaking of
exclusive first looks before that this
video is brought to you by a thermal
grizzly and their high-end thermal
compounds thermal grizzly makes cryo not
paste for high thermal performance and
conductivity without being electrically
conductive so you don't have to worry
about shorting components cryo knot is
particularly good for replacing stock
GPU pastes as cryo knot is a non curing
compound
learn more at the link in the
description below Wow is this for the
road is your chair nice so you get to
sit in one of these so that's gonna be
pretty cool this is also our like our
lighting things so you saw Brandon
working on the colored yeah like
color-changing thing so these are just
air filters okay from like Home Depot
and then what you do is you kind of
stack them isn't meant to be a diffuser
or yeah so you kind of stack them on top
of each other and then you light them
from the inside and you get kind of this
cool glowing box thing but it's just
duct tape and air filters very cool
movie magic
yeah so there's still a lot of progress
for us to make over here obvious so the
goal is you already have three units I
guess technically for not counting this
one is it though is it for okay
so several other units that way first
five units then the world yeah so
several units that has been shown in the
past in other videos we'll look at those
too but this one what is the objective I
mean you guys I know you guys do some
CNC work we just did it for videos
so the
is twofold one is to give us enough
space for storage because right now you
know those fun little puzzles where
there's nine squares yeah and one of
them is empty and you reshuffle already
make the picture we don't have an empty
square right
all right this is the empty square when
we need to move something around to your
swap space exactly so that's the front
here at long-term storage for things
like LTX cereals okay
the other thing is the workshop was
previously over in the first unit but we
had a bit of a noise problem hmm so when
the CNC is running the entire studio
space is unusable however concrete well
yeah so the way these buildings are
constructed is it's eight units with
drywall between the first four and the
other four and then one concrete one
that's structural down the middle so
because this is unit five now we can
have a noisy workshop over here do
whatever it is we need to do over here
and we won't disturb the actual filming
space at all so then I guess the the
question is with all the equipment
coming in are you gonna wrap up content
that uses the stuff like the CNC is
because I see I see
Alex working on custom blocks and things
like that every now but it doesn't seem
like an everyday thing so how do you how
do you utilize the space we've moved
that router probably six times since we
got it on him because it hasn't had a
proper space right so once we've got all
the tools we need they're all within
reach what we'd like is to do far more
maker content we're actually doing
around hiring right now for writers and
I do have my eye open for someone with
some maker fabrication experience so
we're always looking for ways to
differentiate and you differentiate in
your ways with your in-depth analysis
with your overclocking with your
attention to detail that quite frankly a
lot of the time I'm just like really
thanks video you know we want to
differentiate with well the workforce
that we confer things how we can tackle
projects that would take your team you
know three weeks to do right well we
want to do those in three days which is
still a long time and still cost us a
lot but it's manageable this is the
worst SmartWatch of all time by the way
there'll be a review on your channel but
I reached my step target they
goodness you wouldn't even walk it
what'd I tell you what is it called it's
called the new Nubia alpha okay well I
guess there'll be a review on - Texas
you gotta check it out don't miss it
okay so this is the workshop space yeah
anything else we should cover here or
move on to the rest honestly not really
it's it's very incomplete so yeah I
think we can move on pretty safely cool
so this is by far the coolest thing
that's happening in our space right now
so a couple couple key components to
this we finally have the arcade machine
working it's just a matter of repairing
some of the panels and closing it up and
it's like ready to rock this was an old
build right yeah yeah yep knows that
that was a video we were creating that
because we wanted one not because we
needed this is our board games table
okay so we went and got basically every
four plus star board game on Amazon and
we're turning this into kind of like a
lounge so that the ping-pong tables
folded up right now because they
actually just took out all the junk that
was in the front here you just saw that
okay and then these are new racks where
we're gonna learn yeah most of our
component storage over from over there
so is it you think you think this will
get a decent out of use by the team I
actually do think so because this is
pretty much the bang inist
movie-watching setup you ever get see
surround sound I see
oh nice so you can decide 120 Hertz B FG
d 4k or 4k 120 inch projector
I mean why settle for just one best of
both worlds
the couches are a nice yeah
like super comfy so there's already a
game of Thrones watch party that is
scheduled for people to come in just you
know start those new season of Game of
Thrones here so ya know I think once
it's done it will actually get a fair
bit of use and not even this so much I'm
actually expecting the most used part to
be what's gonna be over
so these boxes are all the parts for a
dozen gaming rigs is this for the Lance
Center yes okay
so you're standing in the middle of
these are our D branded tables aha
so we're gonna have six of em Vickie's
custom for you they don't make the size
right no no no yeah there's no way they
just sent us this shoot I forget what I
call unit yeah they sent us a sheet of
this honeycomb black one that I think
looks amazing and we did ups we had a
local guy come and do the six tables for
it okay so we've got six of these twelve
seeds total this is actually the first
kind of semi-finished version of what
it's going to look like so it's going to
be two players on each table like this
we're gonna have blue I think they're
getting minis yes yeah so no no that's
all right Yeti nanos and then we
actually did something that's gonna
surprise a lot of our viewers we went
AMD okay cool our five or what actually
are seven 2700 X so what was the what's
the rest of the build what do you have
for video cards we're good we've got our
TX 20 70s okay 16 gigs of I think it's
only 26 66 best fine it's fine
see sonic 1,000 watt power supplies you
say 16 of these how many high 12 12 12
these rigs so everyone's gonna have
Logitech's whatever this nine one yappin
the renamed c920 without housing but
it's the 4k one actually so I think it's
technically actually new so everyone's
gonna have a webcam Yeti Nano and I've
already got people like hey when's it
gonna be done I want it I want to stream
from the office because we've got our
new 10 gig internet connection so
basically you like you can't drop a
frame
yeah Yeah right right let's I guess
let's talk about this area so this has
got to go teklynx that what's going this
this is going why is that so the reason
is that we're having more editors okay
so our camera den which contains all of
our gear and is where David and Brandon
and our new grip are all gonna sit this
is going to become more editing
bass okay so they are gonna move out of
here and they're gonna go to where we
have all of our storage for cables wires
adapters IO shields and then as that
storage going like in there so this is
this is the old workshop but all of the
like more hardcore tools I don't know
what to point sure it doesn't need a
mallet
anymore this goes in the new workshop
okay so this is only gonna make sense PC
building progress this will be the PC
building workshop so this has been here
forever though right like isn't this one
of the first thing yes yeah this was the
first set that we when we got a pegboard
people said we were copying yeah I was
copying stuff I found online okay so
this area is pretty cool everyone sees
the sets I guess basically every day in
the videos with this one twice a week I
think three times a week and then the
lighting though is not what's shown so
what's going on here first of all you
configured it on your phone which is
pretty neat yeah so you can hear a
perfect one for me to use as a don't
know I don't want to reach your app
perfect that's funny use as a demo as
the sky panel here so we use these Casa
modules which honestly aren't that
amazing I don't know that I would give
them a strong recommendation okay but
they're like mostly good enough so the
idea is that with the lighting grid with
the C stands that are all sandbagged and
kind of fixed in placed all it's just a
matter of coming through being like okay
tech link floor lights and then you'll
see that second floor light over there
is gonna go ahead and turn on so we can
walk on to a set put a camera in front
of it and we're ready to rock nice how
long did this take to really figure out
like to get it dialed it took us
probably three weeks really to really
get a clicker perfected to the point
where we don't change it anymore at all
yeah that's cool and you have a similar
thing going on over here I guess and
this is just a different group of lights
you know that's the greatest thing about
the green screen is lighting is so
important for a green screen but the
quality of the light doesn't necessarily
matter as much it's more about the
positioning so these are actually the
cheapest lights in the entire building
an entire set of like two of these
lights including a stands like
that's 150 bucks or something like that
so we just have this this top-down
lighting on the back of the green screen
and then just a few soft boxes around
the host and then okay all we've done
the only thing we've done in the last
little while is added this guy so you
get kind of that that shine I'm lack of
the host cool off their head so it's
like and let me add a little bit better
separation with the background right and
then these so well maybe talk about this
in our other video sure but can you I
guess let's let's explain why this
happens because to me when I first saw
you guys using these in your own videos
I was just like white why don't you just
clap yeah but there is actually a reason
for yeah yeah what is the reason so for
one thing this does actually give you a
sharper waveform if you are trying to
synchronize versus a clap okay so yeah
it's it's like a vertical line right a
sickly which is nice also it contains a
whole bunch of useful information so
when you have a different person editing
the video versus the one who shot it
this stuff is so important so we need to
know what camera was it shot on that can
help us diagnose things like a piece of
dust or lint on a sensor hmm okay we
should probably include our lens as well
to be perfectly honest with you this
tells us what video it is so if we're
going through and looking so it's really
important to have your slate as the
first frame in the video so that it will
show up as your thumbnail in the
software that we use which is called Chi
know that allows us to see thumbnails
for support of file formats that aren't
natively supported by windows like our
3d so this tells us much faster for the
editors to find within at a glance if
someone accidentally ingested a clip
into the wrong folder for example you
can see oh no this was tackling 1:43
instead of 142 the integration this
tells us who the sponsor is honestly
this doesn't matter as much but it would
give the editor pause if the wrong read
was done and they could be like hey did
we change this for a reason mmm the
writer is important for I think we don't
really track that anymore but whatever
microphone so this tells us do we have a
problem with the microphone was it a
positioning issue which SD card and
which mag it was shot on this is
incredibly important
because our policy is to take
picture of the slate and put it in our
Trello card so that if that project goes
missing we know which cards we have to
then go find on our investigate that's
right on our media sign out board to
find out what happened to it camera op
this is important because if any of this
gets lost we know who to ask for it
right and then the date is well the date
I don't know seems important also these
helpful notes written by Max who used to
work here I swear it's or whatever God
you believe in if you don't take a
thumbnail there will be consequences
so when I hold it up I have that nice
little reminder for my sauce 'im all
right so then we've looked at these sets
a little bit we can talk about this one
briefly here we shot that whole laptop
overclocking thing in here how fun and
this this room is genuinely really
impressive because when I first walked
in here
if you know if you kind of don't look up
above the walls yeah it does look like
an actual house so my wife and we also
had a third party interior designer and
then also an architect designed the
whole thing for us so we provided our
architect with some sort of condo
layouts and we went well we don't
actually need a fridge or bathroom right
or running water in water or anything so
can you design it around like we don't
actually need some of that stuff and
give us kind of a kind of typical condo
layout because what I observed was that
the problem with our sets compared to
like a sitcom set is what I really
borrowed from a lot because they're
designed to look like a place people
actually live but they obviously aren't
in fact most of them are quite open so
they have all these corners like three
walls normally but none of them are 90
degrees okay actually usually it's more
than three so they'll have these
segments and they have this shape and
this depth to them and I was like we
need to achieve that people kind of walk
down hallways but obviously there's a
room there right right so so we so we
borrowed from that a lot so that's why
you'll see corners like that that are
not 90 degrees it still makes the space
feel like a room but it's the weird
shape that you would never see in an
actual build
so let me let me ask then obviously
Linus tech tips sort of really got its
rise in that house
yeah he's it a lot of the videos in the
kitchen I know everyone saw the comments
about like I missed the kitchen right
was this a response absolutely okay yeah
absolutely did you have did you
personally feel like you had an
attachment to that style not an
emotional one but I did miss shooting in
the kitchen because it is just a really
convenient place to shoot you got your I
mean in a real one you've got your sink
right you know for cleaning stuff or
whatever you've got your island which
this is this is a super boss this island
is not a real island it's attached to an
up desk so we can actually raise it if
we want to do content that standing
level like this and we want to be
comfortable or we can lower it if we
want to sit down or we want to be able
to shoot down at something more easily
so the camera operator doesn't have to
like get up on something right so this
is that is very cool so it's even better
than a real kitchen except the sink
doesn't work yes and people I see as you
showed me you've added bins for
collection yeah just in case people dump
things down so now no emotional
attachment to the old kitchen but no it
just it didn't feel it does feel more
like an a like a startup right because
we moved out of our house too and you
lose some of that charm I guess I have
this curve or this this graph of sort of
your your investment versus your
production values as you invest zero
your production values are actually
quite high because your house inherently
has set deck right let's lived in it
looks natural right yeah and then as you
spend you know a lack of money on an
empty box with no you know foam sound
deadening on the walls and you've
actually spent a lot of money your
production values actually go to zero
and then you have to spend far more
again in order to break up the way you
had in the first place yeah but then at
least you get that that work home
separation really helped a mental state
I think legitimacy too so you're not
dealing with constantly looking because
we were in that situation to where
you're constantly looking over your
shoulder for the town to evict you in
your case you actually did get a notice
that's all documented but not just a
notice they showed up yeah they talk to
us yeah
conversation it's it's difficult it's
because the financially a house makes a
lot of sense it does it did right
you're just not supposed to do it yeah
but you can't really blame him I see you
there yeah so this is a really cool set
through isn't there there's that other
one right through here I'd be a bedroom
set okay so is that accessible you just
have to go out this way and then around
yeah and then there's this weird rolling
we can go look at it yeah sure so how
much freedom do the the guys like
Brandon have to just be like you know
what I need another light here I can
they do they just buy it or they go to
eat it then for approval but we never
really denied them I see so making that
what you will all right so our original
plan was to actually have a hallway that
connected these two and have a door into
the bedroom but then we realized it was
more space efficient to not do it that
way I'm sorry that I can't get any of
these lights turned on for you oh it's
fine yeah I I don't actually oh well
sure sure there's your problem the
coolest thing though is this sliding
bookcase hmm so normally you would have
the entry into the room left open but
this gives us more options we can shoot
in every single direction in this room
and if people don't watch the vlogs or
the behind-the-scenes videos or whatever
they'll be none the wiser it'll seem
like we just have more sets right so
this whole thing just slides I'm also
impressed how little that is gone and
now there's no escape I'm impressed with
that little echo there is in here
because if you had a room like this with
an axe with a ceiling you would have
echo issues so that cellulose foam that
we had over in the other unit is also in
here and because we have so much more
clutter and stuff in here you hear it a
little bit yeah but for action for just
conversations we couldn't from this
distance you and I could not hold a
conversation in these three units I mean
I took possession is from all that oh
yeah and reverb I guess yep
big changes so when show set
what is uh I don't know what happened
here what did we do the Len show set it
alright cuz the roast tonight sponsored
by madrina so we put a bunch of we put a
mini boot they sent us a mini fridge for
this ok cool we were talking yesterday
about how you have editorial separation
now from the ad side of things which is
really important right and so the I
guess your personal visibility to what
who the advertiser is even are a lot of
the time I don't know I will I will be
surprised to find out I'll be doing a
sponsor II it'll be like up okay sure
and in most cases I don't even know how
much they're paying for spots
occasionally I'll check what the guys
will be like hey like is revenue okay
like what are we charging for spots
right right but a lot of time I actually
don't know and truthfully the biggest
difference for me is I really don't care
we're at the point now and we're
actually we've reached it a long time
ago we're literally any single tech
company any any five if they hated us
and didn't engage with us at all we'd be
like okay what's the advantage of
sponsors like madrina sore like exactly
the jerky guys I get a lot of people
commenting on our sponsors saying what
does dole shave club have to do with
tech that's the point
nothing yeah that's the fine and despite
it's not a spite ragging on everyone for
the vacuum thing which is really just
because there's also coordinated right
vacuums as a sponsor actually not that
bad don't review them right we have
nothing to do with those long yeah as
long as it's not a review then who cares
yeah yep so we we communicate very
clearly to because a lot of the time on
the brand side essentially the same
point of contact for money and for
creative okay but from our side we
communicate very clearly that if you
want have a creative conversation that's
with me or an editorial conversation
that's still me or someone from my
writing team and if you want to have a
money conversation you talk to someone
from the sales team right and this is
actually a new policy so I do have
obviously some visibility into our
sponsors are and how much they
yes but the writing team no longer does
it all oh and so all they know is we
have a sponsor for this project here's
who it is okay yeah good policy so we're
moving our way towards that's like
traditional magazine format the way they
used to do it yeah which is which is
pretty good yeah and you know the
reality of it is there's honestly no
pressure on us from the outside to make
any of these kinds of changes the I
think and it's it's not something that I
like but I think the landscape is
changing and has changed to the point
where the average consumer not only
doesn't know but even when they do know
they just don't care yeah one of the
terms that makes me the most frustrated
is paid review because there's not a
thing it's not a review yeah and so
we're always really really careful with
the word review yeah use spotlight we
use and things like that we use showcase
showcase that's it yeah if it's
sponsored it's a showcase I feel like
we've communicated very clearly to our
audience that while you cannot put an
opinion in my mouth if you sponsor the
video there are talking points they
won't be my opinion if I give an opinion
that's mine if it's a review there are
no sponsored talking points there's no
message from the sponsor and we draw a
very clear line there the problem for us
is that throughout the rest of the
industry yeah there is no line and by
and large as far as I can tell the
general consumer doesn't care we
actually we have the same concern where
I've had people post comments about yeah
we worked with kingpin the overclocker
I'm looking at his new video crew
obviously is employed by EVG act yeah
and there was a comment I was like this
is the best ad I've ever watched it
wasn't an ad like it was just reporting
we it's got a trade show there's news
topics there's new products we talk
about them and that's the news but the
landscape as you say has changed so that
now even that's perceived as paid for
which when it isn't is very frustrating
so yeah because I mean if you're gonna
be accused of being a paid shill you
might as well get actually do it yeah
like just commit to it yeah
it's difficult yep oh yeah Mike is there
actually counterweights for the gym make
sense yeah so they go on these part I
like this too of a c-stand stand yeah
you our contractor actually made that up
customs are very good it was gonna cost
us like a thousand dollars in shipping
to get like the good one that's only
available in the States are at that time
so you just build water bills yeah so my
office is a disaster I moved a couple
weeks ago but I've actually hardly been
here so I haven't had time to really set
it up properly the desk we've seen into
the build video on that we're gonna do a
new desk oh really
actually I'm really excited about desk a
CV to target is to you okay
to your space yeah it'll be flat nice
that's cool is this thumbnail getting
made yep I like this thumbnail already
Reilly's new area I guess this is all
reshuffled right yes yeah yeah so
Anthony Alex Jake James although they're
not all gonna have two desks for long
certain people need two desks like
Anthony and Alex probably Jake as well
James won't end up with two desks once
we add writing two more writers very
soon though so we're gonna have desks
out here and there just knock good luck
guys
a madman then finally I guess this can
be the the end of the tour this is what
pays for it all is this sales now yeah
so sales and floatplane actually so
Nick's in charge of sales
Lloyd does merch who vivillon I think
we've only shown him on camera a handful
of times Colton and Johnno are out of
here right now preparing for the roast
it's a John's old office too before he
moved that's right so he's back actually
in your neck of the woods Ness right
yeah right and this is where floatplane
media sits this is the divider this is
their excellent sign we moved over from
the other side actually won't plain
media right so this is this where Luke
is now yep oh you back there got so
Luke's right there and then we go that
looks like
we set up we're actually gonna have have
one more other guys will joining us very
soon so we're gonna have two of them
here honestly they're gonna need their
own office at some point like people go
like oh - why do you have so many
sponsors like and I sit there and I go I
have so many expenses yeah yeah but
floatplane I think floatplane is doing
something really really important what
YouTube is terrified to work under right
so yeah that makes sense
I mean since day zero - Media Group has
existed to try to figure out how to not
make itself entirely reliant on YouTube
that was honestly the reason we created
the form because in the event that
went down the idea was okay well we're
gonna have half a million email
addresses right
you can still communicate with dubiously
legal whether or not we could actually
send an unsolicited email hey guys
YouTube kicked us off we're over here
now honestly if it was down to our
survival we'd probably just do it yeah
of course cuz who cares of that point
yeah well then what are they gonna do
shut you down can they do to us yeah so
that was honestly that was it
that was the reason we created it that's
the entire value of the forum I don't
know if we ever make money on it in fact
we don't we it's run mostly by
volunteers we have some contributors who
cover the the server costs and the
occasional paid license for things that
we do actually need to buy but as far as
I'm concerned if it breaks even and it's
there as a as an oh no emergency button
hey that's better than nothing but in
the meantime what Luke Jaden will they
Jay the rest of the team are out Yuki
what those guys are working on is like a
back-up plan not just for us mm-hmm so
will it succeed
I don't know it's worth it that safety
net often are and then of course the
real boss she's not here today either
but up locked okay
so that's that's your old office that's
my old office so my wife's in there now
and then the reason she got the big one
is actually because our part-time
bookkeeper works with her housing as
well and it was the biggest one so right
there's actually two people in it very
cool like why didn't Luke get Linus's
old office because honestly Luke's
probably gonna get kicked out of here
sooner rather than later
because lions media group is adding so
many people he's bringing more people
over here we're just gonna have to get
them a separate office right right
they're gonna have to go legit get
kicked out of mom's basement for the
second time yeah so I guess that's it
for for the office tour Thank You Linus
for showing us around much appreciate my
pleasure I'm glad to be I'm glad to be
helpful
yeah honestly you're doing far more for
me this guy is just an absolute Saint
not only is it coming up for LTX which
is incredible like having that's a good
show other members of the tech community
though be there makes it not Linus
directing it makes it actually about the
broader community and without the
participation of people like you and J
bar nucleus was there last year loose
broth was there elastomer like you guys
changed our vision for the show to be
perfectly honest with you because all of
a sudden instead of it being about Linus
tech tips fans coming and meeting up it
was like no hold on a second these guys
were there they were getting absolutely
mobbed this is bigger than that it's a
good event like I think it's you're
starting to get some exhibitors in there
too which is really we could rupal down
this year they're spending about a
quarter million so it's so like yeah
there's value for everyone so that's
it's it's I'm looking forward to it if
we it is possible actually with how well
pre-sales are going that we could
actually more than break even I'm not
gonna say be profitable because there's
plenty of costs that were not accounting
for that don't follow in the actual
books like there's no way but we could
more than break even on the actual
checks that we write nice so I'm really
excited so he's coming up here not only
for this he's coming up to be part of
the roast tonight I came and helped host
a video with me that extreme
overclocking laptop a lot of fun you
should check it out so yeah no thank you
so if you want to contribute to Linus
breaking even on LTX what is the what is
the website shirt honestly by the time
this video goes up I'd be surprised if
there's no be gone okay
well no I lied so we previously had a
500-seat BYOC I'm going to open up 100
more seats
okay so stay tuned do you remember the
LTX twitter LTX expo
at LTX expo stay tuned there because
Steve's gonna be are we allowed to
announce who's gonna be there yet
there's like a huge list so I think Paul
and Kyle are both confirmed you're
confirmed of Jay's confirmed the point
is there's over a dozen people confirmed
a lot of them smaller naturally so I'm
really excited it's gonna be awesome
more grassroots than ever and yet
quadruple the size so like I don't know
I I think that's just such a cool thing
I will be there covering it just like a
real yeah a big show just like a real
awesome you know what I mean I don't
even I mean like Computex race that's
pretty cool they're running something
that you're getting coverage on so check
