for the kingpin 20 atti overclocking Joe
was here for that one and I soaked the
CP beforehand Joey took care of the GPU
during the stream so we're gonna walk
you through the results we had for the
GP overclock and how high we're able to
get a 20 80 TI and clocks before that
this video is brought to you by drop and
their HD 6 xx headphones built on top of
Sennheiser's flagship hd60 headphones
the 6 xx headphones offer high quality
audio output with wide device
compatibility mass drops 6 xx also
includes a 6 foot cable with 3.5
millimeter plug alongside a quarter inch
adapter for those who might want to plug
into an app the 6x axe focuses its
energy into balancing the sound leaning
toward warmer and bass your audio
they're also easy to disassemble and
replace individual parts making these
headphones trivial to maintain for
long-term use learn more at the link
below so we we had some trouble with
overclocking but we got pretty far and
first I'll point out of that once again
there were several overclockers in the
chat so Roman devourer joined for a bit
check him out on YouTube if you don't
know who he is
actually hardcore overclocking eh hey
build Zoid was in there and then 10x
tabs from from uva was in the chat so a
lot of fun hanging out with them and joe
of course some bearded hardware on
youtube as well linked in the
description below so the overclocking do
we want to let's start with where we
ended up so people get a quick recap
frequency about 2600 so yeah we were
just shy of 2,600 megahertz and to give
you point of reference 20 atti
overclocked like an XE ultra or a
reference card probably gonna be in the
range of 20 50 megahertz maybe up to 20
115 like briefly under cold conditions
with stock cooler so to go from like
2050 the 2600 or 2580
it's pretty damn good yeah it's not too
bad that's that's pretty good yeah I
think if we had more time and we got to
play with the mount cuz it obviously the
paste in the mountain is pretty much key
so using swapping in a lot of time I
mean we've been working for pretty crazy
the past couple of days yes yes going
yesterday we did about 16 hours and
there was a whole day before that
plus your flight so yeah but uh so yeah
we could probably yeah you push it
harder if we weren't under extreme
condition but it is pretty pretty good
yeah well we also were chicken clucking
- we're a chicken clucking or stuffing
it up incrementally we had to make this
dream or injury yeah 20 about 26 not 25
80 megahertz or so the highest power
consumption number I saw when I was
monitoring it was about 680 679 watts I
think yeah and times trying times by
extreme with gt2 co2 is the more
powerful one yeah so that's yeah pretty
good amount of wattage you know a
voltage you were running at the end was
it one I think at the end of his rope
either about 1.4 okay yeah so yeah we
were 1/3 to 1/4 most the time for the
envy BDD which is the basically the core
basically GPU voltage and then there's
and then when now I'd forget what it's
called for that the next one is
basically memory velocity yeah we're at
one point five on that one yeah and then
we were doing about pretty much was it
plus 1600 on them which is where's that
2150 on memory if you look at gpu-z yes
I think that is correct yeah 2150 and
then scores so to give you an idea of
what does that mean for score I mean
like so
L&amp;amp;T overclocked as we said in the stream
yes it's about having fun really and
it's a competitive side of it but if
you're kind of watching and wondering
like okay well what does this teach me
from a perspective of the architecture
how much is the architecture scale with
that frequency increase well at eye-spy
extreme and this will not apply to
everything as will behave differently
but we saw a jump from our original base
score GPU score only was 75 77 and the I
didn't record the final final score but
we were at 96 27 when we had a 450
offset and the percent increase there
versus 75 77 is a 27% increase from a
clock increase of about 450 megahertz
and there probably be more a little bit
higher with the last one we don't median
a little higher if we had recorded that
one and then 50 486 for GT 2 for the FPS
versus the original 44 0.48 gives us an
increase of about 23% and
5941 gt1 versus 48.1 1 gt1 is an
increase of about 22 percent as well so
there's your percent scaling from a a
couple hundred megahertz increase four
hundred fifty megahertz increase
yeah and that memory increases quite
quite good on those Samsung MEMS yeah I
don't whether this should cool things
about the kingpin car do that and many
people talk about is the same song bands
yeah that's not on all the other cars
yeah it's guaranteed Samsonite yeah
guaranteed some some here do have it in
some dope but you're guaranteed with the
King Penn card you get this and they do
clock better yeah it does o'clock much
better yep so there's your quick recap
of the numbers the card itself will show
some footage at some point in this video
two of when Joe was breaking it down and
rebuilding a couple times you so when
you were breaking it down
you used the hand dryer in the bathroom
that's right I was trying to be quick
yeah it actually works pretty well I
probably should have spent a little bit
more time on it but we're also live
streaming it so yeah and then you torch
the pot so torch an Allen supa helps
kind of prime it yeah basically to get a
better transfer so I can hold hold
temperatures better right and then it's
got a lot of condensation on the right
now well yeah it's turned off yeah that
minus 15 right now - 15 still so
temperatures the whole time what were
you most those templates between I would
say between minus 100 Celsius and minus
130 Celsius I didn't really push any
more than that the cope we benched for
pretty much four hours so the cards been
pretty cold and it's kind of battling
that yeah when you're battling card that
are cold that much it causes a bunch of
issues so yeah yeah and then for the
bench if you missed it during I'll link
the parts below again but we're gonna
try to do you memory Royals and they're
the silver and gold that's right and we
have that set to 4000 mega Hertz in the
BIOS and then I just said quick timing
so it's like 15 there's no sale 15 then
you can do better but we weren't trying
to do CPR
yeah these modules actually do much
better on the smaller platform right so
it's a dual-channel kit and we only have
a 360 CLC on the cpu so it wasn't under
L&amp;amp;T
we're focusing on GP today
4.8 gigahertz on the 99 ATX e and then
32 mesh I think that wraps up the
components we used a lot of Allen's you
this is almost completely on T at this
point yeah so I think I filled that
Dewar once during the stream yeah so we
probably just like maybe your 40 liters
or something what just today I think
yeah if we had a CPU container we
would've went through a lot more oh yeah
yeah important this was once we saw at
the very end we'll cut a clip into if we
can find it at the very end the stream
got really active where Joe is like
pouring every couple seconds yeah cuz
you're really on that minus 124 number
yeah you have to keep it at a certain
temping thats where the torching comes
in if that I didn't torch you wouldn't
be able to do that yeah so that's very
important I have to do it every single
time
so just take longer to react if you
don't torch it well you just won't even
react it'll basically like your
temperatures so like say the bench
starts at minus 130 the bench will
basically start heating up so you'll go
to like - 120 real quick and even if
you're pouring it's not gonna basically
bring the temperature back so by
torching it it basically gives a it
Prime's the pot so that way when I'm
tapping it like that you'll see in the
video where I'm basically pouring your
I'm reacting it will actually allow it
to react yeah yeah and then a frequency
wise so for that baseline just to give
you an idea of talked about this in the
stream but frequency scaling versus cold
so the stock KP card with like the
original cooler
Ron's higher than most other cards it's
it's about 20 40 megahertz flat it's
like fixed because it's running so cool
55 degrees or less and then and that's
20 40 megahertz and I'm just putting it
under ln2 and not overclocking no
changes just liquid nitrogen and l2 pot
and you weren't even that cold for the
stock baseline run no I think that was
20 80 megahertz or something like that
has even hired so yes like the as the
temperature goes down the frequency goes
up and then you apply the offsets also
so it's not as easy as just saying like
for 50 offset okay for 50 plus base
equals the final number that's yeah more
kind of hard to tell yeah you have to
basically bring it cold find out what
the lock value
is then you add the whatever voltage you
said are not voltage but your the clocks
you've set from there and then that's
how you get your calculated number so
and it's different for her GPUs
yes--that t they have some variants so
yeah pretty close to twenty-six hundred
Hertz can't really be too bad at that
and we'll try and do more with this Joe
and I will both be at Computex to make
sure you subscribe to both of us to
catch that coverage in the next couple
of weeks it'll be in Taipei and I think
that's gonna wrap our videos for this
weekend so we're gonna go sign more
mousepads
yeah Joey thank you for joining me thank
you sir find him bearded hardware on
youtube or bearded hardware comm you
know where to find us we'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
