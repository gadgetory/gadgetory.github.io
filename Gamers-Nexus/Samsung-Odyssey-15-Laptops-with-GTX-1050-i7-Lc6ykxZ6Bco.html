now I've had to use 2017 checking out
some of these laptops that were shown at
CES but we weren't there to check them
out these are the Odyssey laptops I will
be talking about some of the thermal and
cooling design which of course is our
specialty
I've been going through the base back to
the laptop these are dpi 1050 units so
they're pretty interesting that if only
for that reason before getting positive
coverage is brought to you by a thermal
take and their contact 12 silenced
cooler which has an for mounting sports
you can learn more about that and the
link to the description below let's
throw the Blackie there too there's a
black and a white Odyssey unit these are
all 15-inch models behind me they're
also 17s models which have some
differences for internal specs as well
but for these we're looking at two six
aboard for memory there is an nvme slot
that they've got a 960 Evo in right now
but does not have to ship with that unit
stock you can bring the price down the
SSD is also optional ships technically
with a one terabyte w/g drive also
brings price down the unit cost is 1199
1200 bucks for the baseline Odyssey 15
inch notebook for the GPU we have all
the cooling right here CPU and GPU are
next to each other it looks like I'd
have to take it apart but there's an i7
KB Lake CPU I think it's a 7700 HQ no
news not an 8k model yet so no news on
an overclocking option and then for the
GPU there is a gtx 1050 not a TI just a
1050 that's the only DP that ships with
these units right now today the 1015
comes in two variants there's a 2
gigabyte on the black model and a 4
gigabyte on the white model in terms of
memory they're all stock 16 gigabytes of
RAM it is Samsung Ram I don't have a
hard specs on that memory or timings or
anything like that but Samsung 16
gigabytes basically laptops here I don't
have the milliamp hours I've been told
the metrics to note is eight hours in
mobile mark I believe what the benchmark
use no mark 14 but we will have validate
size internally
for a different battery life on the unit
and other than that the main thing to
look at is the thermal so this unit has
the back hold off I think it's more
screws to take the back off which is
really nice one thing I want to point
out here just because I fix it is one of
our advertisers they're big on right to
repair there's no warranty boy to remove
sticker on this so MSI take note
so no warranty boy does remove sticker I
think four screws once we get access to
that you are free to afraid the SMC's
either of them the memory anything like
that that's kind of user serviceable
there's no warranty loss there I do like
that and I wanted to call it out because
I wish more manufactures would do that
there's also stuff like if you have a
battery or display failure and your
place to ram they're not going to knock
you for that because I should be
unrelated for the heat pipes there are
two heat pipes they have some marketing
name for this I'm not sure what it is
but it looks like a 10 or an eight and a
six millimeter for the heat post as you
can see here they are copper heat pipes
just blacked out the grill or the fence
tax is in the back you're exhausting out
the back where the hinges in this unit
and your intake is here where the two
radial fans are located on the bottom
your intake is at the bottom we have
some b-roll of the cover if you wanted
to see the hex kind of pattern where it
in takes I think that pretty much covers
it the rest of its just an aluminum
copper block as always the copper Coplay
aluminum block I believe we'll take it
apart later but yeah links in
description below for more information
for all water dogs the baseline model
goes up from there I think this is 14 or
something like that check out the
channel for more pax coverage subscribe
for more of a complex gamer snacks
itself out directly thanks for watching
I'll see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
