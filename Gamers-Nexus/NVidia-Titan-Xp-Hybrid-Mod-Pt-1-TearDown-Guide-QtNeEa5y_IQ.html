actual Titan XP with the lowercase P as
in the brand new one $1200 video card
this was sent to us on loan by a reader
grant thank you for sending that over
and for him we are going to be
converting this into a hybrid card so
that'll give us some extra clock
Headroom stabilize things a bit and
we'll have a full review and all that
stuff online as well but this is going
to be a teardown so part one we're
taking it apart looking at the PCB and
we'll be talking about the components on
it a little bit and then part to
building it up which will be partly a
guide for a hybrid mod a part three will
be the results on how it has improved
with the liquid cooling kit so before we
get into that this is brought to you by
ifixit.com you can use code gamers Nexus
to get five dollars off of any tool kit
purchase from iFixit we have a few of
their things on the table I'll be using
today like this magnetic project mat
very useful for putting the screws out
as you remove them from the card so you
don't lose where they go because they
are many different sizes with these
Titan and 1080 class cards that's just
how Nvidia decided to do it so we'll be
using that let's get started with this
this thing first of all this is a
reference design there are only
reference designs for these Titan XP
cards as far as we know right now anyway
and things are pretty standard from the
outside there's a bit of red tinting on
the PCB I suppose that's different but
otherwise no DVI so that simplifies the
tear down a bit we won't need to use the
three-point-something millimeter hex to
remove that and the rest is going to be
1.5 and 2 millimeter tools to remove
everything so allen keys philips head
stuff like that nothing too crazy but
specific enough that you would need to
make sure you have the stuff before you
start because nvidia doesn't use just
philips for everything they put a whole
bunch allen keys on here so we're going
to start with removing the backplate and
once we have the backplate off we can
start pulling off the cooler and then we
can take apart the top side of the
cooler with that completely separated
from the rest
so I'm going to grab a small Phillips
head to start with to remove these tiny
screws on the backside and then we will
go from there okay so back plate is
split into two pieces for die-casting
reasons so they cast two different
pieces and split them and that means we
can remove this one now this is not
really that functional the plate you can
see there's actually one spot with
there's thermal contact between a pad
but otherwise it's just for looks maybe
a little bit of structural support it's
not even really contacting anything on
the card so it's primarily a looks thing
so remove that that was just a few of
those Phillips screws once we get in
there we now have some of these hex
heads and these are actually kind of
annoying to remove so we'll save those
for a minute later from now get the rest
of these Phillips out and these you need
to be really careful with when putting
them back in because and put this in
that section because when you're putting
these screws back in if you go one tick
past where they feel pretty secure they
will snap as we've learned from
experience so be careful about that
because you're not going to have an easy
time finding replacements if you need
them back please chase now we just have
the big screws that are connected to the
expansion the cover the expansion slot
pull those okay this is two big ones
they hook through the back plate through
these hooks on the plate and then into
the front side of the cooler and now we
can start removing the tiny ones and
then the four big spring tens and ones
will do last so that is
sighs for 4-millimeter it looks like
so all these do is hook into the bottom
side of the cooler on the wall to cooler
and the shroud this connects to the
heatsink directly these connect to the
shroud and the base plate and the
smaller Phillips heads we took out of
them are strictly for the back plate I
serve no other purpose
so once we've gotten these out plus the
four that secure the heatsink proper
with the vapor chamber we'll be able to
separate the cooler and the shroud from
the PCB the GPU of stuff we care about
and set on that that's also honey screws
is that 10 12 14 so 14 of those 4
millimeters and then we've got another 2
overhears the 16 total times 2 ish more
last year you're at about 30 screws just
get the back plate and the card
separated and we need to do these for
now so grab a big Phillips I like to
cover I sort of partly remove these and
then I cover them that way they don't go
flying because they will they will fly
out once you're down to one or two of
these
okay cool let's go ahead and remove this
cover plate back here Israel over here
now we should be able to separate the
card now I could do this with the PCB
down to keep as many thermal pads where
I want them as possible so here we go
this looks pretty similar to the 1080 TI
founders edition PCB and cooler for that
matter this looks like a nickel plated
copper cold plate so nickel plated and
that's making direct contact with the
GPU this is the biggest Pascal GPU
that's out there right now for consumers
anyway vram contact pads these are your
thermal pads for the vram modules and
this time unlike the 1080 t is we
actually have 12 so for 812 normally
this one right here is missing for the
1080 T is but it's actually present on
this because we have 12 gigabytes of
gddr5 X memory and then in terms of
everything else this is your fan header
down here this is your power for the LED
so that powers this GeForce GTX LED and
then for the sets and things like that
we still have Fairchild sets are the
same ones okay so looked it up some of
these parts are a bit different than on
the 1080i founder's different PCB we
will look into having the board analyzed
separately one part that is definitely
the same that six nine-30 fats for the
memory the RM up here at the top of the
board which you can see our 1080i
founders
PCB analysis to learn more about those
and now we're just going to clean off
the GPU proper to get it prepped for the
hybrid mod which will be the filled up
process and there is reveal of GP 102
and for those who karats GP 102 - 450
and we ran a 1 Rev which means it is
probably the first production ready
consumer ready
rev of the GPU of the silicon err okay
so there's the GPU we've got the memory
from micron as expected
loving gigabit per second capable and
the sets will look at separately then
connect your power connector a couple
shunts on the board you can see one
right here one up here and those are 5
milli ohm shunts one down here as well
if you wanted to do a shunt mod you get
short and and try and get some extra
power delivery back side nothing special
really small crappy thermal pad here for
contact with the the backplate but
otherwise that's it so we're in a
position now where we can start building
it up as the hybrid mod and get things
going for grants so that he can use this
for machine learning and things like
that
check back shortly for part 2 or we'll
do the build up if you haven't seen
those before this will show you how to
do it on your own and it applies for the
1080i 1080 even the some of the
reference and D cards though the steps
are a little different but the same idea
so that's it thank you for watching as
