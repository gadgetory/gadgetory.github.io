review will go just by looking at the
front panel of the case this is the new
NZXT age 500 and despite appearances
cooling performance is interesting with
this one and EXT has opted for smarter
design with its limited fan count of two
and it's limited intake options and has
bet instead on design making up for an
exterior that would be lacking in most
other cases the age 500 is a case study
literally a negative pressure and we
think it illustrates excellently how a
tuned fan placement can make up for
potential deficiencies in access to air
before that this video is brought to you
by thermal Grizzly's high-end thermal
paste and liquid metal thermal Grizzly's
cryo knot is an affordable high quality
thermal compound that doesn't face some
of the aging limitations of other pastes
on the market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted tests by a tube at the link
in the description below the short of
this is this is the new s 340 it's a $70
case it's the age 500 not I there's an H
500 I and then an aged 500 NZXT so it
took some of our advice here with H 700
I where we asked that they make one
called the H 700 D D for dumb and remove
some of the smart features so I did that
here that I didn't brand it dumb
sadly you win some one you lose some so
it's the age 500 this is $70 it's the S
240 replacement the I version is $100
and is RGB enabled and has the smart
device we would probably just say let's
focus on this one for now so that's a 40
was actually really highly regarded it's
one of the best selling cases in North
America at $70 it has really good build
quality it's got a good value it
performed okay okay enough anyway for
what it was doing and you have to
remember although today in the current
climate it's not as impressive of a case
when the st 40 came out it didn't have a
lot of great competition and airflow was
good enough considering that all of its
competition other than a couple
of lesser known brands was really not
any better in any aspect anyway so
that's 340 is a huge act to follow and
following it up with age 500 is odd an
only one major way which is that the
name doesn't match at all so I'm the X
he built up all this good will with the
s340 branding that's not even in the es
series it's in the H series following
the age 700 which has a mixed reputation
presently in fact when we were invited
to a conference call about this case I
declined because I said what could you
possibly need to tell me on the phone
that I don't already know by looking at
it it's just a success or it's the age
700 isn't it the answer was no it's
actually not it just shares the same
name so a bit of a marketing
disagreement there from my perspective
where it seems like it should be in the
S series if it is an S user place when
nonetheless that's just the name and it
has nothing to do with the product
itself product itself is actually
surprising in a lot of ways it's got a
true to form identity in terms of the S
series case that's ting 40 looks like an
absolute 40 they've added a half sheet
of tempered glass or 3/4 really and then
they've also made a couple of other up
fits for modern design and although it
may surprise you by looking at the case
they NZXT actually did specifically
design for air flow and it's something
that we tested heavily and found that it
performs far better than we expected and
this is what we'll get into it a point
later talking about how good design can
make up for what would look lacking
otherwise and even make up for brute
force where a lot of the cases will just
make up for this design by sticking a
bunch of fans in the front at a high rpm
you don't have to do that but it is the
easiest solution let's go over the
criticisms addressed that NZXT looked at
for this one so for the H 700 I we had a
few main complaints one of them was the
smart device
there isn't one on the aged 500 at least
not one pre-installed and there is one
on the H 500 i but that's not the
version we're reviewing the important
thing is that now customers have a
choice of whether they want to pay extra
for the smart device or not stripping
out the smart device and lowering the
MSRP to $70 brings it much closer to
what we liked about the original s 340
without any unnecessary bloat to
increase the price the
var was also addressed this is something
we mentioned in the H 700 I review where
we said it was artistically bent in a
way that wasn't really a great means to
rout thicker power cables and that we
preferred the older s340 style well that
old style has returned on the aged 500
and there are even little cable tie
points built into it on the back which
is something that we specifically
requested in our reviews of other cases
so that's been well addressed by NZXT in
addition to the smart device option
panel fasteners are another thing the H
700 I used for basic thumb screws to
hold its glass panel on which is
extremely common but didn't really live
up to the level of design we saw
everywhere else in that case and it was
an excellent case overall just remind
you we gave it an award and our end of
year Awards we just didn't like the
smart device in contrast the aged 500
uses a 1/2 panel design that's so simple
and functional we're surprised that we
haven't seen it used in other cases the
bottom edge of the glass is held up
behind the upper edge of the power
supply shroud and the top edge has two
plastic knobs that snap into the chassis
and a single thumb screw in the back for
security those are really the only
negative points of our H 700 I review
originally although the smart device
took up half of that review and also the
front part where it threw it in the
garbage but those have all been
addressed so I've been told that the
smart device is significantly improved
will certainly revisit it when we have
an opportunity to perhaps after copy
tags so it sounds like it's gotten
better if you are interested in the I
version of this but obviously we don't
recommend buying anything until you have
some reviews to look at if not ours than
someone else's we'll try to look at it
if it's gotten better we'll let you know
and maybe it can be something worth
considering as an alternative to the SD
40 elite but in the very least $70 for
this is is a pretty good starting point
so the extra 30 bucks for some LEDs and
the smart device which it kind of feels
like bloatware more than anything where
you're paying for stuff that isn't core
to the product the product is a case and
it's not really a necessary part of a
case so it feels a bit odd to spend
money on stuff like that especially in
the under $100 price bracket however
just wanted to note that NZXT says
they've been working on it a lot so
theoretically it's improved so
gently but we'll look at it later for
now though let's talk about some of the
build qualities of this one including
table management space for Kayla
management is fairly narrow it's 19 to
23 millimeters and it's tightly
regulated by plastic channels with
built-in velcro ties the channels can
removes for extra room but between the
velcro and cable tie points it should be
possible to strap everything down
tightly enough to make this unnecessary
some neatness is required the side panel
won't do all the work for you of mashing
down big tangles of cables one bit of
news and exe is losing ground on the
puck battle that's been raging since
they sent us the first one as we noticed
in the H 500 that it's missing the tiny
plastic designated cable router puck
found in the Aged 700 I so please take a
moment and leave a comment below of f to
pay respects for the plastic puck rip in
peace we're happy to see removable fan
cages become an increasingly common as
well as you'll see in the front of the
case it makes testing different fan
configurations much more convenient and
as a user
it makes swapping fans easier as well
the front fan cage can only hold to 140
or 120 fans the smaller fans are used
they go towards the bottom of the case
will save discussing whether or not
these slots are a good fit in the
thermal section all in tanks are
filtered on this case and all filters
are removable which is important with a
stock negative pressure set up the top
filter is just a square mesh stuck
between the fan in the case which is
fine but the filters along the sides of
the front panel and under the power
supply clip in and have nice plastic
frames the filters at the bottom and the
side of the front panel are especially
nice with mesh sandwiched between two
layers of plastic rather than just glued
on top
they're also comically tiny and narrow
but it's nice to see such attention to
detail many manufacturers wouldn't have
bothered putting anything there at all
all filters can be removed without
altering the cases appearance which is
another significant bonus in the way
this case was designed if you do want to
take them out you're not even gonna
notice from the outside we liked the
perforated power supply shroud with two
lists two and a half inch sleds in the
Aged 700 eye and it's just as good in
the aged 500 unlike past NZXT cases
there's no space for an SSD between the
glass window and the power supply shroud
since the shroud is actually the
exterior of the
but counting the hard drive cage there's
still plenty of drive support the top of
the power supply shroud has conveniently
large cutouts for i/o connectors and
PCIe power cables screws including the
thumb screws were incredibly tight and
this is something that we've been
talking about with NZXT cases forever
basically since NZXT was one of the
first case companies that we worked with
and back when it was just me and ever
since then thumb screws have been a
problem it's not a big deal it's
certainly not a big enough deal to
change how we feel about a case overall
or to change the recommendation but the
point is they're starting to really
refine their cases and once you do that
you're kind of left with small things to
work on one of the small things is that
the thumb screws are so tight in the
stock configuration out of the box that
the tool list design is in fact not to
lists you do need a screwdriver and this
is just something other factory does
where the thumb screws are irrationally
tight for what they're supposed to do
airflow isn't something we've talked too
much about so far and the H 500 is the
blankest cubist of all the blank cube
cases in the minimalist family of design
lately except for maybe the s340 elite
but the age 500 does have one strip of
filtered ventilation along the steel
front panel so they've got a bit over on
this side nothing on this side there's a
bit of ventilation on the bottom
underneath and then some ventilation
obviously under the power supply shroud
on top of the power supply sure there's
some perforation helps sometimes but in
some cases we've tested where we taped
over that completely it actually does
nothing just depends on what you're
looking at it's got an exhaust then an
exhaust up here or intake if you want to
reconfigure it and also by the way this
top is not 240 compatible NZXT had a
very clear design goal and we can
respect that they didn't try to be
everything for everyone because there's
absolutely given a take when you're
designing something like a small box but
as far as airflow goes it's actually not
in the stock configuration right now
stock configuration NZXT ships with a
rear exhaust fan here and a top rear
exhaust fan there that's it no one take
vent so what they going for is negative
pressure and the result is actually
interesting especially for GPO thermals
because what happens is because there's
negative pressure air with a negative
pressure setup air will find a way into
the case so it's gonna go through every
crack and can find in the case which
poses a potential dose problems but NZXT
is done well as we noted with placing
dust filters that are easily removable
pretty much everywhere still though
it'll find its way in couple points here
dust filtering the top not really
necessary it's exhaust and it does
actually impede air flow a little bit
and it can rattle if it's not tightened
all the way which was the case with ours
when we got out of the box but that's
easily fixed
another point because it's negative
pressure air also finds its way in
through the back here through the i/o or
rather through the PCIe slot covers and
also through the i/o but it finds its
way in so if you have a single GPU set
up it'll work in into the video card as
we'll show you in the thermal results
which is really interesting and then you
have radiative heat coming off the back
of the card radiating up into the CPU
radiator which in this case is at our
cooler and that will increase the CPU
temperatures a bit relative to a case
that has perhaps intake instead of a
negative pressure purely set up but
again has interesting implications for
GPU performance because a CPU can be a
couple degrees warmer doesn't really
matter
up to a point anyway with intel
especially less you're at t.j.maxx it
behaves pretty much the same although
you do want to stay under something like
ninety C with an overclock depending
what you're working on GPUs are far more
sensitive to thermal changes down to a
degree of about five where if you have a
5 C swinging thermals you can have a
slight drop in clocks we're talking
single to low double-digit megahertz but
it is far more sensitive so it looks
like NZXT has built for that rather than
for CPU thermals and it's interesting
not really a hundred percent sure what
how much of this was intentional versus
not but either way air finds its way
into the case and we'll just go through
the thermal numbers and explain how all
that works so as always here's the test
bench on the screen briefly just give
you a listing of parts you can find the
full description the article in the
description below where we have
Patrick's article that's written up and
has all the details including test
methodology details
starting with the torture test for the
NZXT age 500 only data average CPU
temperature was 61 degrees Celsius over
ambient and the torture test and with
the stock fan configuration again as a
reminder that's dual exhaust removing
the unnecessary top filter lowered that
to 57 degrees it's a good thing that
NZXT included the filter so that it
could be used in case you reconfigured
it to top intake but if the stock
exhaust fan layout is used it should
definitely be removed we left the filter
in place for all other tests since
that's how the case ships and adding a
140 millimeter intake fan to the upper
most of the front mounts lowered TB
temperature barely more than removing
the filter did down to 56 point 5
degrees while moving both 120 millimeter
remove fans to the front and not having
any exhaust fans was equivalent to
removing the filter at 57.2 degrees
exhaust only may not be the best stock
configuration but it does leave more
room for CLC options in the front if
that's the route you want it to go
comparatively for CPU temperature the
stock 61 degrees Celsius measurement is
pretty warm especially for a case that
has two fans directly next to the CPU
cooler 57 point 3 degrees is perhaps the
fairer number to compare since we do
recommend removing that top filter
that's acceptable but still not great
the age 700 I managed fifty three point
nine degrees and even the SC 40 elite
beat it out at fifty five point eight
degrees there's no fan pushing cool air
directly into the CPU cooler so the air
being pulled towards it has already been
warmed by the GPU and it's also dealing
with radiative heat off the back of the
GPU and obviously as always this will
vary based on your system configuration
average GPU temperature in the torture
test is 52 point four degrees Celsius of
the stock fan configuration and 53 with
the top filter removed a minor change
within margin of error interestingly
temperature went up quite a bit with the
140 millimeter intake fan added up to 59
point three and from the eight point
nine degrees Celsius with the 120
millimeter fans moved to the front
intake this is where the stock fan
configuration starts to make more sense
if intentional NZXT chose negative
pressure because this allows the GPU to
draw air in through empty expansion
slots rather than relying on intake from
the mostly sealed front of the case when
front intake fans were added even at
once pointing towards the GPU
this airflow pattern is disrupted and
the GPU can no longer pull air from
behind the case at least if it remains a
balanced or positive pressure setup
that's not gonna happen it'll turn into
exhaust instead comparatively the age
500 stock CPU temperature doesn't break
any records but it's more competitive
than the CPU temperature manages fifty
two point four degrees is equivalent to
the age 700 I which has twice as many
fans and the throne will take core p3
which is an open-air bench basically and
has no intake fans it's also right next
to the aged 500 B mesh which is good
news for the NZXT case and bad news for
the readability of our charts we've
raised the age 500 P mesh heavily in our
review of the case and the age 500 to be
clear not the Coolermaster one manages
to achieve similar GP performance with
more tuned design approaches though cv
performance is a different story and
it's a bit warmer that's 340 elite
average 53.9 degrees so the aged 500
beats its predecessor and at least one
thermal category 3dmark is next and acts
as a gaming stand-in the GPU operates at
fifty four point five degrees over
ambiens and is again equivalent to the H
700 I am Thermaltake open-air Corp III
but we don't have the SD 40 elite on
this chart for comparison the cpu isn't
stressed in this test at least not as
much and we typically don't point out
its temperature but it's worth noting
that CPU Delta was several degrees lower
in the H 700 during this test 27 verses
34 see again the exhaust fans are
pulling hot air up through the CPU
cooler and out of the case so it's
dealing with radiative heat off the back
plate and being spit out of the front of
the video card out of the fans for a $70
case it's not advertising itself as a
big air flow competitor the H 500 is
doing well overall for GPU thermals and
although behind them CPU thermals those
aren't as important as GPU thermals
running blender with CPU rendering we
measured an average temperature of 38
point 6 degrees Celsius between the
cooler master C 700 P and the extremely
forgettable silverstone KL 0-7
differences in this test are fairly
subtle so smaller differences become
more exaggerated and significant average
GPU temperature during GPU rendering was
twenty-six point seven degrees Celsius
this is also a degree higher than the H
700 I for one so closer to the Leon the
Alpha 550 for noise levels to 120
millimetres
NZXT fans running at 1300 to 1400 RPM
make the age 500 a bit noisier than
average at thirty nine point six DB a
audibly equivalent to more open cases
like the mash spicy and the kukoncar and
there was initially some buzzing from
the top fan as well as if i braided
against the case but we tightened it
down foley for noise testing and for the
rest of use running the fans out of
normal speed should keep the case fairly
quiet since the front is sealed and the
fans are all at the back just be careful
about temperature if you do decide to
stop down the fans so the big deal here
is that this is a $70 case it's replaced
in the s 340 and a $70 case receives
different degree of criticism than a
$200 case as was the instance with the
a7rii
separately it's also a case that doesn't
really advertise itself as doing a whole
lot the age 500 I certainly might as
it's supposed to be smart and abled and
have RGB LED strips and all that stuff
this one it's just a steel box
but that's kind of what we want in an s3
40 replacement the whole thing of st 40
was that for its time it was
revolutionary and it followed up the
aged 440 it had a power supply shroud
which is still a pretty new thing that
NZXT he popularized with its earlier
cases and also it went full steal you
didn't see any plastic parts on the
outside of that case that was the big
deal with it and so they've stuck to
that they've stayed true to the brand
other than the naming which is a bit of
an odd choice to us but that's what NZXT
decided to do as a case we like this one
the H 500 is good these 500 I without
even testing it I can tell you an extra
$30 it doesn't seem worth it they may
have improved the smart device that's
fine if you really want the RGB LED
strips I guess get it but there are a
lot of cases at $100 that's a furious
price point to fight in this one is up
against very few cases at the $70 mark
that are actually quality engineering or
construction course here's got some
competition in the area generally and
there's a couple other decent cases out
there but there's also a lot of garbage
at $70 so we do like the H 500 where
it's positioned it's okay for thermals
it does particularly well on GPU cooling
as well as the aged 500
which we actually really liked that case
and praised a lot as performing about on
par with it in our thermal benchmarking
so kind of hard to fault it for that CPU
temperatures yes are behind there are
way less important if you're using an
Intel CPU and to some extent less
important on an AMD CPU though it's
boosting is more temperature driven than
until these days but you can kind of
deal with that by changing your cooling
configuration stock it's far better than
we expect it to be fully honest and
engine seats done a good job with
designing around a negative pressure
setup that actually works now what do we
recommend something like a salive for
this absolutely not
it'll suffocate but also we wouldn't
recommend SLI so irrelevant point you
could put coolers in here liquid coolers
you're going to be limited by what's
mountable in the case I think to some
extent it doesn't make a lot of sense to
complain about for example no 360
support because it's not big enough and
also at $70 are you really spending that
much money on a CLC but that said it's
totally valid that you can't fit a 240
in the top that would certainly be a
nice touch it's just you run into the
cable management bar so maybe that bar
were removable or something you could
deal with it is removable it might be
okay so we actually took a quick pause
while I was going through my point about
the 240 radiator because I kind of
looked at it might wait a minute
that Killa managed to borrow actually is
removable so we removed it it's tied to
some cables right now and here's where
it gets a little weird you could totally
fit a 240 in there this is an unzip see
crack next 52 that would definitely
clear now the problem is there will be
minimal fan clearance between the memory
and the radiator to be fair so if we're
counting for that then we've got a
radiator that is thirty millimeters
thick or so and you're gonna have a 25
millimeter thick fan so there's your
problem
the only reason this doesn't support a
longer radiator is because you're not
going to clear the memory that's in the
memory slots so if this case where a
couple millimeters higher like maybe
seven or so
without doing a hard measurement on it
just kind of looking it over it would
fit a 240 on the top but I guess they
were trying to go for a specific size
category or maybe they already had
tooling they wanted to use or something
like that that's really the only it's
not even it's not really a heavy
complaint it's just like a what-if
scenario so yeah what if they went a
couple millimeters taller they could
have fit to 40 but at least we
understand now why they didn't now that
I've kind of looked at it more closely
and yeah Kayla managed bar can be
removed but it doesn't fix your memory
clearance issue so anyway the case
overall we don't have a ton of hard
criticisms for they have addressed all
of those from our age 700 I review
already so we're happy with age of 500
overall and for $70 case it seems fine
that $70 it's hard to complain too much
in general well actually that's not sure
if you look at some over $50 case
reviews but for this one it turned out
pretty well so anyway link in the
