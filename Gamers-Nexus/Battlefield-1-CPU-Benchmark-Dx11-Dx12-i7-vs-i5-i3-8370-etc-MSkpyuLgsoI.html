we first started bench working CPUs in
battlefield 1 just after the GPU content
was completed for that game and
following that I had to follow up with
AMD to look in some of their test
methodology so we can validate it on our
end with CPUs but the CPU benchmark is
finally complete we tested the i7 down
to the i3 and the x-48 4583 7080 through
20 or more before getting to the results
this content is brought to you by an
tech and the new cube mini ITX case
which positions the GPU faceplate so
that it's visible through the top of the
case learn more in the link below we've
posted two content pieces for
battlefield one already the first was a
benchmark of video card performance in
the game using an i7 as we normally do
because we're isolating the video card
as a variable and the second was a look
at HB AO vs. SSAO technologies in the
game and their impact on performance
which was for the most part negligible
today we are looking at the cpu
performance explicitly and cpu
benchmarking is a little bit unique it's
not quite as straightforward as GPU
benchmarking because isolation of the
CPU as a bottleneck is sometimes more
difficult to do and extrapolating the
scaling between one CPU in the next is
also not necessarily easy so we've
defined all of that as always in the
article linked in the description below
but I'll go through some of it here just
for a quick recap tests were conducted
using ultra settings at 1080p with two
GPUs one was a GTX 1080 FTW hybrid used
to place emphasis on the CPU performance
interestingly the 1080 is powerful
enough that just running a lower
resolution is enough to demonstrate CPU
scaling and we can leave the graphics
options more realistically high this
isn't new with this generation of GPUs
the next test was an Rx 488 gigabyte
gaming X which gives more of a
middle-of-the-road look at fans and
we'll get to that later the point of
running a lower resolution is to show
scaling performance and as you increase
the resolution load will be placed more
heavily on the pixel pipeline and the
GPS ability to draw and sample all of
those pixels which of course shifts the
load DirectX 12 performance was measured
using the on present variable from
presentment we extract 1% and 0.1% low
metrics using a Python
scripts that game razaaq's created game
graphics are configured to ultra 96
degree horizontal fov gb memory
restriction off and be sync of course
off and the test methodology in the
article probably answer all of your
other questions including drivers used
why we tests a particular way we did and
what the realistic hardware impact is
we've also got our benchmark courses
there our article also has some raw data
from test runs and combat scenarios
versus non combat which gives a better
idea as the scaling and this is
important as multi players effectively
impossible to reasonably benchmark
between this many devices so our scaling
test in the article should answer those
at multi player performance questions
we're starting with DirectX 11 DirectX
12 will come next the ISO 159 30 K at
stock frequencies hits a frame rate of
about 158 FPS average with lows well
above 100 FPS the 6700 K with
hyper-threading enabled that's the HP
one in the benchmark chart is next in
line at 155 FPS average with one percent
lows of 111 and 0.1% lows of 96 there's
not a huge gap here and a good amount of
that is because of the 6700 KS increased
clock frequency over the 59 30 K which
you'll see it in a moment is actually a
pretty big impact on performance between
CPUs interestingly disabling
hyper-threading results in a reduction
in FPS average of about 4% down to
nearly 149 but our lows take the biggest
hit and now 95 and 80 FPS this isn't
significant in terms of visible
framerate you'll still experience the
game more or less the same way but
hyper-threading is clearly beneficial to
low values in this test scenario moving
down the line the more mainstream I 566
hundred K at stock speeds is achieving a
140 FPS average landing it about 15 FPS
behind the hyper-threaded 6700 K this is
where we see CPUs of beginning to limit
the GTX 1080 FTW hybrid we selected and
that's intentionally used to demonstrate
exactly this type of performance scaling
these 6600 KS performance trails of 6700
K with hyper-threading by about 10%
moving further down the list the I 560
409 K CPU at 2.7 gigahertz a good deal
slower is starting to show a frequency
advantage to
the 6600 K with a performance disparity
of nearly 20 FPS between the 66 and 6400
i-5 CPUs finally we're met with the i3
6300 at 111 FPS average now a full 44
fps behind the flagship skylake CPU and
then the FX 83 70 at 90 FPS average and
average FPS is fairly tightly timed on
most these devices but that has a lot to
do with one the API in battlefield one
DirectX 11 tends to do well here and to
the GPU itself which is responsible for
a lot of the frame times but still the
FX 83-70 does well to keep it's low
frame rates within a reasonable range of
its average despite a lower average
overall the FX 83-70 is about 65 FPS
behind the 6700 K trailed next by the
power saving 8320 II that's what the e
means and it's suffix it's a lower
powered chip and that's at 77 FPS
average the a-10 7870 K follows this but
note that these 78 70 K is effectively
identical to the athlon x4 880 K so that
CPU interests you or is the one you have
you could compare it pretty directly to
the Sony at 70 K and the 880 K may even
perform marginally better because it's
got a 100 megahertz increase in clock
rate next the athlon x4 845 runs at 63
FPS average just a few frames behind
where the 80k would be although there's
a clear choke point on these CPUs when
running on a high end GPU one useful
thing we can learn is that the x4 845
would perform close enough to the 80 K
that the price difference could be
enough to encourage 8:45 pickups over
the 80 K in this case though there's
some overclocking differences as well
let's look at the scaling of all these
devices in percentage form for a moment
this chart shows devices with the i-5
6600 K is a baseline of 100% performance
and the important part to note as stated
or using a 1080 FTW explicitly to draw
out the limits of the cpus and see where
each chokes as we go further down the
stack you'll want to make sure your cpu
choice does not limit the GPU choice at
least too much it's always possible but
note that also the higher-end device is
used with high resolutions as expected
would put more load on the GPU so if we
this 1080 at 1440 the story might be a
little bit different many of the
differences between the i5 and i7
devices vanish when moving to 1440p or
4k on the GTX 1080 and that's because
we're now shoving more pixels into the
pipe for the GPU let's look at DirectX
12 D X 12 destroys frame time
performance at the 1% low and 0.1% load
spectrum and post-
scaling when moving between api's with
Intel we see a negative hit of
approximately 25 FPS on the I 767
hundred K and on the i5 6600 k FX 83-70
increases its average by 1 to 2 FPS but
like all the other devices GPS included
post worst low frame performance the FX
8320 ii also posts an improvement of
about 2 to 3 FPS average on the FX
architecture and the 7870 k nearly an
880 k equivalent with the x4 845 both
see slight negative scaling of about 1
to 3 FPS but these chips are different
architecture and they run at fewer cores
so we're confident in these results but
we're curious about them after looking
through some of AMD's own public blog
posts about their performance we decided
to reach out to Andy and ask how they
tested battlefield 1 and after a few
days of back-and-forth emailing with one
another we talked to several people from
their test team and engineering team in
the test lab and validating each other's
tests and methodology and things like
that
GN we decided to run more tests this
time with a lower end GPU and AMD said
they were seen upwards of 28.5 percent
gains with an FX 6350 and an RX 480 so
they said that they used a three minute
long test which is a bit longer than
what we do and they played on a
different map completely they played on
through mud and blood which is one of
the British levels and other than this
their settings were pretty similar to
ours in terms of quality we decided to
adopt their methodology and use that for
further validation and given the
information that we had I think we have
a pretty good example of the way AMD ran
their tests but I still don't know
everything about their setup I don't
know exactly what Rama is what speed it
was I don't know if they're using on
present and there's a couple other
things we don't
as well but we've got a good amount of
it so it would be odd but it is possible
that running the game for a longer
period like their 3-minute test run
would be enough to begin hitting some
sort of draw call or other threshold
that you might encounter with a poorly
optimized game and might not encounter
with a shorter test given battlefield
ones already questionable optimization
this did seem worth testing a few more
things to note here
MD ran four test passes per setting per
device and then they averaged all four
of those results in gns methodology we
run six to eight test passes and we
always throw the first two sets of data
away this is because the game outputs
horrific ly varied performance when
first launched and we see drastically
reduced performance while still loading
everything into memory some examples of
a single device going through multiple
test passes around the screen now you
can actually see how it scales and sort
of levels and equalizes as you run
through a couple of the test passes and
we believe our test is representative of
what happens in a multiplayer map and
I've tested that too after you've
spawned and run around for minute or two
performance improves greatly with the
x11 across the board and in dx12 0.1
percent low frame time performance that
first run though will look like garbage
compared to the rest and so we do what
you do with garbage we get rid of it
this is even visible when the level
isn't loading you can see prefab
elements at various LOD is attempting to
pop in especially environment elements
like foliage and grass now another final
important point to note Andy did not
provide us with frame time metrics and
only offered us average frame rates and
we've already shown as a few other
outlets have that battlefield ones
DirectX 12 performance can actually be
worse in terms of frame times than DX 11
and as a result it can stutter through
gameplay so the our X 480 these tests
were conducted on the through mud and
blood campaign level and were tested
using a much different methodology we
ran three tests for three minutes each
with highly consistent frame rate output
because we'd practice the test run and
could accurately repeat it each time so
it's pretty accurate despite being three
minutes long these tests were run after
receiving input from AMD on their own
internal testing of the game with an Rx
480 and an FX 83-70 we're still seeing
no meaningful scaling technically in
this testing the DX 12 results
about four percent better than the dx11
results but that's still four percent
and the negative hit the frame times is
definitely not worth it even with these
altered test methods we're not seeing
the performance winds that am the
reported and told us and we're
definitely not seeing favorable frame
time performance in dx12 though and ii
did not make any comments about frame
times now this doesn't mean that AMD is
wrong it also doesn't mean that we're on
and really it just comes down to a few
things there's differences in testing
that we may not know about different
variables potentially measured for
performance or different means of
measuring those variables and and he
also did use an FX 6350 which although
it should not scale a difference of four
percent to 30 percent when looking at
something like in 83 seventy it could
certainly scale a little bit differently
so we don't have one of those and
obviously didn't test it so GN spent
about a full week validating these
results it's more time than we spend on
any of these benchmarks really in terms
of validating existing results that were
confident in so now we're definitely
fully confident in the testing having
retested it a thousand different ways on
many different devices and we're
confident that the performance
difference between DX 11 and the X 12
remains largely the same for multiplayer
use especially we're seeing no scaling
performance that is noteworthy on DX 12
regardless of whose GPU or CPU we use
and this fits our previous testing which
validated extensively the GPU
performance with both DirectX 12 and
DirectX 11 and saw similar scaling that
is to say effectively zero and negative
scaling when looking at frame x
battlefield ones DirectX 12 performance
remains spotty and suboptimal regardless
of whose CPU is used or even GPU for
some extent anyway but definitely on the
CPUs and overall we're seeing poor 1%
and 0.1% low frame rate metrics and
that's across the board even when
conducting extended benchmarking 3
minutes 3 passes of that which is a lot
longer versus the regular 30-second buy
eight pass test runs and we've defined
all of that and why each one works and
works well in the methodology section
below but the point is that with both
sets of methodologies ours and Andy's
we're still seeing poor framerate
scaling at the
and the frame times kind of stretch out
and have a larger latency between them
on occasion and that is reflected in
those pretty spotty 1% 0.1% lo metrics
again regardless of device the stack
remains mostly the same in terms of
hierarchy the high end i7 and i5 k skew
devices do perform significantly better
with drags x11 the i7 6700 K posts a
definitive performance gain over the i-5
6600 K in dx11 at about 10 to 11 percent
averages and the 6600 K runs about 15%
faster than the i-5 6400 9ks CPU largely
a result of the faster frequency on the
6600 k FX series CPUs and the i3 6300
CPU are struggling in terms of
performance and scaling overall and
looking at the other devices and the
disparity between the FX CPUs and the i3
6300 could be related to the increased
memory speed support of the i3 which is
what we're researching next so stay
tuned and subscribe for that then the x4
8:45 and x4 8 ATK surrogate post
performance that is pretty limited and
dragging the GTX 1080 down with them to
around 60 to 65 FPS average but would
still be perfectly playable on bf one if
reducing settings and running an equally
low end GPU like an rx 460 GTX and 50
tons of DTI or similar of course
depending on your GPU CPU selection
could be less relevant if you're running
something like GTX 1060 or an R X 480
the 10% difference between an i5 6600 KN
is 760 700 K could become largely
irrelevant in the face of that lower and
GPU that's what you'd expect the GPU
starts becoming more of a choke point
than the CPU depending on your graphics
quality settings and next we're looking
at memory so that's my next point of
interest for Battlefield 1 I do suspect
that memory has a bit more of an impact
in VF 1 than what we might normally
expect in other titles so we'll be
testing that not 100% sure yet that's
why it has to be tested but do subscribe
to that content as always a comment if
you have thoughts on this testing and
the patreon link is in the post roll
video if you want to helps out directly
