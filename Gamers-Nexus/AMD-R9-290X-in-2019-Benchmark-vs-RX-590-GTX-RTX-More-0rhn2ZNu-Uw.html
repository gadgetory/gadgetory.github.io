finally had some time and excuses to do
content that we expressed interest in
doing about a year and a half ago so
this is the r9 290x you might remember
it it's one of the previous this
specific one is a reference card from
AMD from several years ago predated the
390x predictably the RX 480
the fury X the rx 580 and so forth so
it's a good couple generations old
depending on how you define generation
this this this instance and today we are
retesting it for modern games so we're
looking at DirectX 12
API is looking at modern dx11
implementations versus existing AMD and
NVIDIA products to see how it stacks up
in modern gaming and if it's worth at
this point upgrading before that this
video is brought to you by mass drop and
the PC 37 X gaming headset with
professional-grade Sennheiser noise
cancelling microphone the PC 37 X
headsets are what we use in the office
for phone interviews where audio and mic
quality are critical making it very
convenient high performance solution for
gaming or professional work the
headphones come with a detachable
ten-foot cable for safe storage during
travel a standard 3.5 millimeter plug
and soft foam 4 firm but comfortable fit
over the ears
learn more at the link in the
description below so like I said we
wanted to do this content a long time
ago originally just now got to it but
we're here now so this is the only 290 X
we have still in the lab and it is a
reference model but before anyone gets
upset that it's not going to be
representative of their own cards
performance note that we overclocked
this to a point where it's it's a bit
faster than most of the AIB partner
models of the 290 X when they launched
so we have stock and overclock numbers
the overclocked numbers represent pretty
much any overclocked
to 90 X because we did max out the fan
on this to make sure it could reach
those higher frequencies and my hearing
has now been permanently damaged as a
result of it because it's about 60
decibels when it's running at full speed
so try having that next to your head for
about 6 hours and other than that I mean
the card was a flagship it was high-end
and this particular models four
gigabytes the 390x popularized an 8
gigabyte alternative that was a refresh
with 290 X and 4 gigabytes though before
most of these tasks you'll see is
actually fine because it becomes a
limited elsewhere first for differences
versus other cards look at something
like an RX 580 which is an RX 480 that
card is a modern well it's kind of a
flagship it's a bit of a weird place to
be because it was a flagship of Polaris
but it was never really a high-end
product there's always mid-range
competitor with something like 1060 but
this reverse is that so
the 290x has more TM use at 176 verses
144 texture map units on the RX 580
which is a 480 it's got more ROPS at 64
versus 32 now the the capabilities of
those ROPS will change over time as
architecture advances but having more is
still going to be beneficial and this in
particular is something that we want you
to pay attention to during these
benchmarks because with the increase in
ROPS there's a benefit to things like
anti-aliasing when we do our GTA 5
testing it uses a to tap msaa it also
benefits higher resolutions kind of the
same thing there were you doing with
multiple samples with AAA or it's more
pixels with high resolution so ROPS will
be where you might see the difference
between a 580 and a 290x close as the
resolution increases as those Rob's are
tapped more heavily in their rendering
workload so that's something to pay
attention to and Rob's it's it's it's
where the output is effectively
assembled into what becomes the image a
bitmap image at the end of the pipe so
we're testing with a reference card we
overclocked it blasted the fan speeds
all that stuff let's get through the
testing today we've got a lot of modern
gaming we have GTA 5 is an older
representation but this card is circa
about two thousand thirteen or fourteen
or something so it is quite old at this
point but it's worth testing so let's
get into it and then we'll talk
conclusions Sniper Elite 4 will start us
out before displaying results remember
that one of the most interesting areas
to look is going to be for scaling
performance between two fixed goal posts
as we change resolutions if the distance
between those posts tree
so that's indicative of an architectural
advantage or deficit at the new
resolution will set the RX 580 and r9
290x at stock settings for these goal
posts Sniper Elite 4 gives us a well
optimized dx12 title to test with which
is valuable because we want higher frame
rates even at 4k to better illustrate
some of those scaling gaps keep in mind
that the 290x came out long before 4k
was popularized and also before DirectX
12 was even released 1080p still had
almost all of the market share at this
point at 4k we see the r9 290x stock
card at 38 FPS average with it lows it's
surprisingly close by at 32 and 30fps 1%
and 0.1% low well look at frame times in
a moment but just stick with the
averages for now overclocking Headroom
was limited and capped at about 10 60
megahertz for core getting us to 41 FPS
average and climbing 7.9 percent over
the r9 290x card these performance
figures pegged the 290x and its
overclocked counterpart at rough
equivalence with the RX 588 gigabyte
card not too distant from the new rx 590
Fatboy this is without yet considering
power consumption mind you so that field
of things has potentially changed a bit
as well the GTX 1060 is just surpassed
by our 290x results as is the GTX 970 as
for those posts we mentioned the r9 290x
stock GPU allows the RX 588 gigabyte
stocked review to hold the lead of about
2.9 percent transitioning to the more
limited 1080p results we now see that
this 290x has a stock frame rate of
about 98 FPS average allowing the RX 588
gigabyte card a lead of 9.4% with its
107 FPS average the fact that the r9
290x closed the gap at 4k suggests to us
that the 580 becomes limited and its
ROPS
and TM use but primarily ROPS the 290x
is better equipped on this front just in
pure Roffe account leaving its biggest
limitation as frequency which is why the
card has more trouble keeping up at the
lower resolutions once again the orange
580 gets slammed with higher demand on
the pixel pipeline where
comes more limited the r9 290x pulls
ahead and that's kind of where we see
the shrinking gap the same pattern would
emerge with anti-aliasing as well as
it's effectively increasing the sample
rate in the same way or at least with
the same intensity that increasing
resolution would do this is also
becoming Rob's bound at least when you
start modifying the anti-aliasing
settings so even if you play with lower
resolutions on 4k but you like higher
AAA or something like that you'll still
see these same types of behaviors emerge
as for 1080p performance on the whole
the 290x performs behind the gtx 1066
gigabyte and ahead of the RX 574
gigabyte cards frame times are what
we're most curious about as a reminder
frame time plots demonstrate the frame
to frame variants and time to present a
new frame this is a measure of frame to
frame intervals in milliseconds so lower
is better versus benchmark progression
on the bottom axis the more consistent
each point on the line is to the
previous the better the user experience
deviation from the mean and access of 8
to 12 milliseconds becomes noticeable to
most gamers the r9 290x does well in
this department with sniper elite for
its a sniper's credit the game is
remarkably well built but the 290x still
needs the right hardware to keep frame
pacing consistent in this title we don't
see too much deviation from the mean
frame time with the biggest variants at
least frame to frame variants in the
form of three to four millisecond swings
this is completely acceptable and as you
can see isn't too distant from the
modern rx5 90s performance the 590 has
fewer peaks on average but the
difference in consistency is
unnoticeable overall for most players
the r-tx 2060 is also plotted as an
example of the most modern architecture
where we're nearing an ideal frame time
plot the takeaway though is that the
290x does well on frames I'm consistency
in this particular title and that's
despite some early life issues with
frame time consistency in the 290x
many of these were patched up with later
driver updates but the rest would likely
be more game or API dependent f1 2018 is
next giving us a DirectX 11 game that
uses the same API as almost all of the
market back when the 290x
least gesture scaling reasons we'll look
at 4k results despite this card not
really being meant for it and especially
2019 at 4k the r9 290x for gigabyte card
ends up at about 33 FPS average right
here that's similar to the gtx 1066
gigabytes and gtx 970 the RX 588
gigabyte outperforms the 290 x 4
gigabyte by 4.6 percent
landing at 34 FPS average we can also
learn from the 390x results which shows
a 34 FPS average this card is a refresh
of the 290 X with a higher frequency and
double the memory capacity in this title
it rapidly becomes clear that the memory
is not the primary limitation as
performance only increases by a few
percentage points and the loads don't
really change all that much the 290x and
390x are more limited by the GPU than by
the memory moving on to 1440p we see
similar resolution scaling as the
previous game the RX 580 stock GP is 56
point 6 at PS average is nine point one
percent ahead of the r9 290x is 51.9 FPS
average protein a relative game and
performance for the RX 580 again we
think this is because the 290x can
leverage its increased ROPS and texture
units at higher resolutions or higher
anti-aliasing values closing the gap as
resolution increases that doesn't mean
it's playable out those higher
resolutions or that is better just that
the gap closes it illustrates how the
GPUs of scale for 1440p resolution the
290x is still reasonably playable in
this title dropping settings from ultra
high to just high or similar would make
for consistent 60 FPS and Beyond
comparatively the 290x does about as
well as the gtx 970
although the 290 X's at lows manage
higher results with the 390x not too
distant the 390 X's extra memory doesn't
get leveraged in a meaningful way for
this benchmark versus some modern cards
the 290 X is outperformed by the GTX
1060 and rx 580 alike we don't see too
much improvement for the 290x at 1080p
moving up to 65 FPS average and with
still minimal gains from overclocking so
rx 588 gigabyte runs at 72 FPS average
for a lead of 11.6 percent to recap this
title we see 11.6 percent improvement in
the RX 580 at 1080p and
one percent at 1440p and 4.6 at 4k
showing very clear performance
improvements in the higher frequency
newer cards particularly at lower
resolutions shadow of the Tomb Raider is
up next giving us a DirectX 12 title for
another modern look at performance DX 12
didn't officially launch until 2015
so the 290x was made well before the new
API saw any adoption at 4k the 290x
obviously struggles at 24 FPS average
making it largely unplayable with these
settings the rx 580 doesn't do much
better at 25 FPS average with the rx of
5 at 90 at 28 FPS average let's move on
to something more reasonable have 1440p
the 290x runs at about 42 FPS average
with the gtx 1060 functionally tied with
the 290x the differences are inside of
error margins so we can't state if one
is better than the other in any
meaningful capacity the rx 588 gigabyte
leads at 45 FPS average with the 590 at
50 FPS average and Vega 56 at 62 FPS
average 1080p positions at the r9 290x
in playable territory even at with these
higher settings at 60 FPS average for
the overclocked version and that's about
where most partner cards would fall in
58 FPS average for the stock model that
puts the 290x as comparable to the gtx
1066 gigabyte and behind the RX 588
gigabyte far cry 5 uses geometrically
complex meshes and longer view distances
making it one of the more draw call
intensive benchmarks we run for this at
4k far cry 5 positions the 290x at 26
FPS average right between the gtx 970
and 980 cards and 40 in the RX 580 a
lead of 8.3 percent at 28 FPS average
this isn't particularly playable under
these settings so once again we're
mostly using them for perspective at
1440p performance climbs significantly
it's a 43 FPS average which is about
where the RX 570 and 390x perform and
videos gtx 1066 gigabyte out performs at
the 290x by a few percentage points here
with the most modern cards posting
significant leads the RX 580 holds a
16.7% Lee
showing one of the largest gaffes we've
seen between the two yet but still
following the trends that we saw
previously 1080p really carries this
trend though now allowing the RX 588
gigabyte car at a lead of 22% which is
the biggest gain we've seen last far as
a reminder that's against 8.3% at 4k and
16 white 7% at 1440p so our earlier
Theory remains consistent as for raw
frame rates the 290x is still adequate
for 60fps and far cry 5 at 1080p with
these settings but it's getting a bit
lon on the tooth
Vega 56 and GT x10 70s or even RDX 20
60s would offer considerable performance
improvements as you can see in the chart
is just a question of do you have budget
or do you really care because if you're
happy at 60fps 1080p the 290x is still
holding on reasonably in most of these
games GTA 5 is a 2015 game and is the
oldest on our benchmark but it's also
the most played game out of everything
in the test suite at 4k GTA 5 lands the
r9 290x at 2004 FPS average which is
within error of the RX 580 or even
slightly leading it for the first time
all bench and not too distant from the
GTX 970 this is more of a synthetic look
of course since it's not particularly
playable 1440p again post the r9 290x
and RS 580 as roughly equal in
performance we run GTA 5 with 2x MSAA
so it's likely we're seeing a potential
ROPS limitation still on the RX 580 it's
a good example of how anti-aliasing also
impacts performance with these cards
the 390x does actually post meaningful
improvement over the r9 290x here and in
at 53 FPS average but this is clearly
more of a change in frequency than
memory capacity as the overclocked 290x
isn't too distant from the 390x stock
card so the cards really not all that
different from some of the mid-range
modern cards that power consumption it's
a bit of a different story there but and
also the thermal design of this cooler
was terrible but if you had a partner
model then that is less of an issue or a
non-issue so it really just comes down
to the performance and of course if you
have a 290x yes there's really no harm
you feel like upgrading now you can buy
a modern 300 to 400 dollar card and get
a pretty substantial uplift like pagan
56 for example in these charts you saw a
vega 56 is significantly improved over
the 290 X and that's further and if you
feel like going through some of the
power mods that we did with the registry
with power play tables so plenty of
options there the the RT X 20 series
2060 is an upgrade and it is better it
feels a bit odd because I guess in terms
of spend you potentially add a bit less
than you were when you bought this
originally depending on what price you
bought this for so 2070 might be a more
more comparable price the original
purchasing point of a 290x but either
way yes there are significant
improvements of course in the market
that's really not unexpected but the
interesting takeaway is that the 290x
does better at these higher resolutions
than relative to other cards that are on
market today then at the lower
resolutions and that's because of its
it's beefed up ROPS pipeline and extra
TM use and things like that the memory
capacity didn't seem to affect
performance all that much is that
unfortunately you can't really leverage
the advantages and things like 4k or
1440p often anyway 1440 bit more because
the card just starts falling behind I'll
swear like frequency overall where
Anthea has seen significant improvements
over the last couple of years so should
you upgrade well it's entirely up to you
you can decide that but hopefully you've
got at least some understanding now with
the charts of where this would fall
versus today's card so when making a
purchasing decision for an upgrade you
don't actually buy a lateral move and
get something that's equivalent like rx
580 it's a bit better far cry 5 it sees
a significant improvement at lower
resolutions but overall @rx 580 is not
really much of an upgrade neither is a
GTX 1060 for example you want to go a
bit higher than those cards so that said
for a once flagship to equate the kind
of mid-range cards of today it's not bad
for the mid-range cards of today it does
show progress and especially progress in
price that's a good thing but the goal
posts always move with games because
games just get harder to render anyway
so that's it for this one though this
was requested by a lot of you after I'd
originally suggested the idea
