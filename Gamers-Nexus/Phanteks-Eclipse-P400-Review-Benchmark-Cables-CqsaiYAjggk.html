since we got back from CES it's been one
after another with the MDX amantha into
the Corsair 400 sea and today we're
looking at fantex new Eclipse P 400 mid
tower enclosure
we've been name-dropping the NZXT s340
an awful lot lately and that's for good
reason the industry has taken to an
obsession with power supply shrouds
shifting or eliminating main compartment
hard drive cages and compacting down to
mid tower size and none of that's
necessarily a bad thing the increase in
drive density has lessened the
requirement for multiple hard drives and
optical drives are basically obsolete at
this point so stripping down cases to
remove unneeded structure that obstructs
cooling especially is an overall
positive direction for the 70 took $100
mid tower market fan tax eclipsed P 400
ships in two varieties the P 400 and
p400s the latter of which cost $10 more
for some sound damping foam and the P
400 is listed at a base price of $70
about the same as the S 340 which is 60
to 70 and just under the 400 C which is
90 but the P 400 which is $70 goes to
$80 if you buy it in white and it also
goes to $80 if you buy it in the p400s
the p400s with white goes to $90 so
depending on what you buy it changes
quite a bit and if you wanted to add
more harddrive cages that's an extra
seven dollars per cage and this whole
model the fact that I've just listed
three or four different prices for two
cases with identical tooling and chassis
identical everything except for some
sound naming foam and remove the side
window and the fact that these have
ancillary charges for extras is a part
of a greater problem with fantex failure
to understand the industry they've taken
this DLC seasonpass approach to computer
components and they've got accessories
and add-ons and drive cages and power
couplers and dual system cases where
they should probably be standard and
simply changing the color of the case at
ten dollars it's confusing and it
reminds us of a model that videocards
had taken in days past where so many
SKUs and prices existed for the same
silicon that buyers got confused and
frustrated and just well bought
something else because it's easier but
we'll return to that argument moment
thoroughly before getting there let's
talk about the cases core features it
specs interior exterior and then we'll
go through the thermals and all that
good stuff
the p400 is an ATX mid tower that ships
stock with two fans one 120 in the front
bottom and one 120 in the rear
optionally an additional 120 fan can be
installed on the front or two top 140
fans and radiator support for a iOS
exists up to 360 millilitres in the
front which we have not validated or 242
80 in the top but not in every scenario
and we have tested some of those there
are seven expansion slots - 3.5 inch
hard drive slots hidden under the PSU
shad toward the front and 2 2.5 inch SSD
sleds at the rear of the board tray
pretty standard as an extra feature a 10
color LED creates an under globe below
the front panel of the case cycled
through using a button in the front now
the PSU shroud is the big obvious
feature here and it's actually more
problematic for fantex than it is
functional first off the vertical
clearance is so close to the PSU that
the shroud actually scratched the top of
our standard form factor PSU a pretty
expensive one at that thanks to some low
hanging tabs on the chassis once you're
able to diagonally cram your power
supply into position kale management is
immediately troublesome with regard to
both EPS 12 volt and PCIe cables PCIe
cabling should be routed through a
cutout in the top of the PSU shroud but
unfortunately fantex haven't thought of
that and so it's got to go through the
board tray channeling and this is
something that courser has done well
with their 400 see though they didn't do
it there's 600 C and we did criticize
them for that pretty heavily and NZXT
has done well with its cases on the
market in fact even Rosewill with the
gun near and Rosewell is a sort of store
brand of Newegg they even have the cable
cutouts in the power supply shroud now
if that was too petty for you I've got
more the power supply shroud is riddled
with holes for presumably airflow I
suppose but that doesn't really make any
sense at all considering the power
supply fan should be pointed down and
these are holes not ducts so had fantex
designs ducts to better draft the air
into the GPU fans they make sense maybe
but here it's just unnecessary drilling
through the Paris flight shower that
creates a more industrial but
functionally useless look
I mentioned also though the EPS 12-volt
connectors let's move back to that in
most circumstances clearance won't be a
problem for this as a CPU power but if
you try to install a radiator in the top
and you may have extra fans up there you
run into an issue where the EPS
connector from the main compartment is
the only way throughout the cable
because if you do it through the channel
into the back there will be collision
issues with some other boards and as
many of you know the motherboards move
the EPS connector around depending on
who made it and what the spec is so in
some instances like one of our EVGA
boards that is actually an issue where
there's a collision low profile memory
also must be used in such an instance so
we specialize in thermal testing here
and we use a couple of thermocouple
readers attached to thermocouples k spec
thermocouples test methodologies and the
full review links in the description
below hit that link to learn more about
how we test the p4 100 uses a thick
plastic paneling on the front that
obstructs air flow NZXT Corsair and ROS
will also do this with their similarly
designed cases but they're all running
either side ventilation or more serious
bottom and top breathing ports the P 400
has a breathing port in the bottom front
panel that's pretty small and it's got
poor ventilation overall that's largely
for looks in the top panel with nothing
at all on the sides for the first test
we actually removed the p400s faceplate
to determine just how damaging it really
is when it comes to air flow and results
were somewhat impressive we've done
these types of tests before but the
difference here was just pretty massive
and it's comparable really to go in
almost fully open air with the open air
bench GPU performance improves by nearly
10 Celsius I'm going to remove the
faceplate with CPU thermals gaining a
couple degrees on their own 10 Celsius
is big especially on the GPU and now
obviously it's not realistic or good
form to run a case with no front panel
you may as well just run an open bench
at that point but it does highlight fan
tax poor thermal testing with the P 400
and shows that the enclosure should
minimally host ventilation on the sides
or at least use a thinner plastic fin
set with a lower density for the
comically useless top ventilation on the
front panel but let's put the faceplate
back on and look at how this thing
performs against this competition fan
tax Eclipse P 400 enclosure is the
hottest on the bench for CPUs operate
night 43.1 Celsius delta T / ambient
just behind Rose wells new gun near case
at forty two point four one and NZXT
s340 at forty one point nine two the
courts are 400 C outperforms the whole
lot of mid tower shroud happy enclosures
and the 600 C a much larger enclosure
with a greater cooling focus winds out
on the chart no big surprise there GPU
thermals tell a slightly different story
now the P 400 poles marginally ahead of
the s 340 and the Ganga near is
technically ahead of the P 400 but the
lead is within margin of error at
staggering 0.1 Celsius difference not a
whole lot and effectively identical in
performance across the board and all of
that is without even talking about the
small stuff which is what fan tax most
routinely fails out with a P 400 it's
these small items that are classic of a
sort of newer company to market where
they're trying to follow new trends as
quickly as possible and not necessarily
focusing on the greater picture like
innovating new types of these mid tower
cases which definitely can be done and
all these small problems with the P 400
just add up to a lack of experience for
example the top of the PSU shroud is
riddled with not only useless holes but
exposed screws in the middle of a
landscape of industrial looking barren
steel the screws are there to interact
with structure underneath the shroud but
you might not know it from a glance they
just sort of look pointless like they
were forgotten there fantex should have
riveted the underlying structure or
screwed it in from literally anywhere
else in that area because the entire
point of a power splash shroud is to
clean up the build but I guess fan tax
missed the memo a couple years ago when
these got big because this sort of
negates that with this industrial
leftover parts look rather than going
for a cleaner look that not only hides
the cables which this does technically
do but also looks clean in its own right
the 10 color light is another issue of
trying to fit too much into a cheap case
the light bleeds undesirably and
produces a harsh conical beam of light
that over exposes its underlying surface
rather than dispersing more naturally
across the table for that import racer
under glow that fantex seems to have
wanted to get this effect the P 400
would have to use a better lens with its
diodes or use more lights with the
softer emission across the board
neither of which is necessarily with
production cost on apparently a $70 case
because they're already charging $10
more just to make it white so if they
can't really add these higher quality
lights or deploy them in a higher
quality fashion it just doesn't seem
worth it to me to have at all because it
just appears cheap and sort of
borderline childish rather than
befitting of a case whose archetype begs
to be discrete but hey if you really
like the look the P 409s non white I
guess isn't that bad of a deal it's when
you start adding all these DLC add-ons
that it becomes a bit more bloated the
case is thermally unimpressive it's not
bad it performs about the same as its
competitors but fantex really could have
driven this home with a better thermal
design they could have driven it home
with a lot of things really it's just
all these small things add up and make a
case that is unimpressive and somewhat
disappointing across the board then when
you look at all this DLC add-on
seasonpass stuff they've done with the
hard drive cages and the fact that the
whole case is different prices for
different colors and ten dollars more
for science which to be fair other
companies have done that Silverstone
course are both done that foam cost
money but it's it just kind of feels a
bit insulting almost as a buyer where
these some of these things are normally
included like the drive cages used to be
just thrown in a box and included I feel
like I'm saying the same thing I said
when DLC was coming out and you sat
there you know 10 15 years ago going
this used to be in the game or this used
to be called an expansion pack I feel
sort of deja boo' with the case and
that's not something I like
so overall here's the deal if you like
this case you like how it looks
don't let me talk you how to buying it
because ultimately thermally it performs
about the same as some of its
competitors but when it comes to ease of
installations lacking on cable
management features it's lacking on
class and design for some of the
internals and it's missing out on
overall vision I would strongly
recommend looking at the cases immediate
competitors before pulling the trigger
on anything and those would include the
NZXT s340 and the Corsair 400 C which is
technically $20 more than this unit but
that puts it at the same price as the
white and silenced version of the P 400
so this is the two main ones I'd look at
there are plenty of other cases in the
$70 range some of them years old but
they're still good they're all good
cases for the most part if you sort of
narrow it down to the made
designs that have survived over the
however many years they've been out and
if you still like this case more if or
if you just generally like the classless
industrial look of the inside which
obviously I'm not a fan of but that
doesn't mean it's bad if you are then go
ahead and buy it but that is all I have
to say about this case
