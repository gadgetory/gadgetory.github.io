market as a standalone case but we're
going to test it as if it could be so
what we're doing is isolating the
variables of the Walmart dtw systems to
look at the quality of each different
component and this case only comes with
a dtw one two and three but we've put
our standardized test bench in it for
case reviews and that's what we're gonna
be working with today treating this as
if it were any other case that we could
review from the aftermarket part
selection before that this video is
brought to you by us and the gamers
access store you can go to store it on
cameras nexus net to pick up one of our
ceramic mugs critically acclaimed mod
mats or educational video card tear down
and PCB Anatomy posters that teach the
names and placements of all the key PCB
components learn more at store des
cameras XS net or click the link below
so a couple things to keep in mind here
clearly because you can't buy this as a
standalone case this was really an extra
and it's an academic exercise we're
seeing how good the case is if it were
able to be tested like a normal case
which I mean you can do it everything
fits and it's just an adapted version of
some supplier case and they it seems
that they bought it from great wall
great wall makes cases kind of like
Joan's bow so if you're not familiar
with Joan's bow you might know the
company rose well it's basically the
store brand of Newegg and Rose will has
a case called the colon and as soon as
an ADIZ the AI crystal it's the same
case it comes from Joan's bow then those
two companies put their sticker on it
much like walmart has done here although
Walmart's done some light customization
that we'll talk about in Patrick's
building though it's like primarily this
front panel which has been replaced from
what is clearly used to be a plastic
panel because there's holes in there for
the plastic alligator clips those have
been removed and instead replaced with a
glass panel that's screwed in from the
inside so there's some light
customization there but otherwise this
is a supplier case that any of the
companies on the market could likely
purchase and then rebrand if they wanted
to just like a lot of the other low on
cases and this case in particular it's
kind of similar to some stuff we've seen
in the past so it's got three fan mounts
in the front there 140 capable but
they're 120 in the builds that Walmart
assembles if you wanted to for some
reason you could buy one and upgrade it
that's probably an advisable because
that point you might as well build you
but the case otherwise pretty standard
layout so it's got a power splash route
there's some holes in the power splash I
know particularly reason but they're
there right about the hard drive cage so
you can see into the cage when you get
the system see what hard drive it is
underneath the hard drive cage there is
actually some ventilation for the drives
which is there's no we're clear point to
why that's there which we'll talk about
that later because it ends up serving
more as an exhaust because this is a
positive pressure system with three fans
intake one fan exhaust so you end up
with positive pressure the top has no
ventilation it's a flat top and they
were radiators supporting the top either
which given the circumstances is fine
the front you could fit a radiator in
there probably about a 240 max not sure
about a 280 we didn't try it 280 the
front panel distance the glass to a case
distance is about 4 millimeters or there
abouts so it's about the smallest
distance we've seen for a breathable
front panel although the BitFenix and so
competes both thermally and in design
choice for the front panel the backside
of the case is also pretty standard so
for this there's a couple SSD mounts so
you've got two mounts here there's an
optional mount in this area actually two
of those optional mounts here except the
Walmart case has covered those optional
2.5 mounts with these cable routing
devices I guess cable combs basically
it's in plastic cable clips which
actually work out pretty nicely with the
stock Walmart build they do tie the
cables down more than you might expect
so that is not something we always see
from the lower end cheaper OEMs where
they actually will manage the back side
of the case Walmart to their credit did
it that's something we gave them credit
for in the original thing but anyway
that's the back side of the case from
the DIY approach you've got a couple 2.5
inch drive mounts there's hard drive
mounts down there that's also where
Walmart installed that 2.5 inch drive
when they ship the system standard power
supply support you couldn't fit
something too deep though because you
run into the hard drive cage is pretty
soon after extending past the arm 650 X
distance that's more or less the case
though as an overview so let's go
through Patrick's build notes and
through my thermal notes and you'll have
a full picture of how this case performs
as a standalone case if you could buy
one for DIY purposes the Walmart dtw
case is clearly not a case that was
created specifically for Walmart
was it wouldn't have three unused
two-and-a-half-inch mounts and unused
five and a quarter inch mount holes for
one forty millimeter intake fans or an
LED control cable labeled reset switch
that's been rerouted to an added on led
box it also wouldn't have a clearly
bolted on glass panel in the front which
obstructs the five and a quarter inch of
bay that you shouldn't be using anyway
this is a generic enclosure from an
existing supplier with some light
customization to fit Walmart's needs and
given the shipping box it came in it's
likely that the case ships out of great
wall great wall as a supplier in the PSU
and case space to some extent though
it's best known for its corsair CX PS
use the upside of this repurposing of
the chassis is that the case is more
versatile than otherwise necessary we
were able to install our normal ATX test
system without any clearance problems
for example fitting the fall cooler at
about 140 hundred fifty millimeters
height from the board it's possible to
swap different fans drives and other
components into the case which isn't
something to take for granted in a
pre-built system the stock motherboard
is micro ATX so even the fact that the
case can fit normal ATX boards is an
unintended bonus here and just to be
clear it's not uncommon for a base
chassis to be reused and modified by
even larger name manufacturers or store
brands like Roseville who buy from
Jones bow to make the Cullinan for
example the front of the chassis has
holes drilled into it to fit round clips
commonly used on plastic front panels
which is what this chassis was
originally designed for but the front
panel in this enclosure is a pane of
tempered glass that's been jerry-rigged
to the front the supplier does deserve
credit for securely mounting a glass
panel without any visible screws from
the outside especially on a chassis that
was built for plastic originally but the
method of attachment makes taking the
front panel off inconvenient both side
panels must be removed to reach the four
K screws that hold on the front panel
this flaw is fortunately or not canceled
out by another one since there's no
front filter at all there's no need to
take off the front panel to get to it
because it's not there the target
audience for these pre-built systems
isn't interested in building their own
compute
so they're probably not interested in
taking them apart and dusting it every
few months either unfortunately this is
also one of the easiest ways to protect
a system from an early death as dust is
one of the most common killers of a non
enthusiast desktop PC or even an
enthusiast PC the only filters in the
case are along the bottom there's a
reasonable filter for the power supply
and a completely unnecessary one for the
hard drive cage it's unclear what the
purpose of the ventilation is underneath
the hard drive cage why there's a filter
there since the case has positive
pressure three fans in the front intake
one in the back for exhaust it functions
only to exhaust air that hasn't yet had
a chance to reach any of the hot
components internally which would be a
tremendous oversight if done by any
respectable case manufacturer everything
except the glass panels is constructed
from steel typical of inexpensive cases
there are some small stamped
reinforcements on the bottom and the
shroud and the only part of the case
that's over at leaf flimsy is the metal
side panel the problem is that this side
panel can't hook into the case along the
whole bottom edge because a gap is left
in the chassis to fit the power supply
so the bottom corner is free to flex
outwards if it isn't screwed down the
PCIe slot covers are also of the single
used variety and they're stamped out of
the case material and has to be pried
out with a screwdriver which is a
cost-cutting measure we almost never see
an individually sold cases these days
capacity for cable management is
surprisingly decent although the system
still came with power cables zip tied to
the two and a half inch base there are
plastic cable channels at the front of
the case and a slightly widened section
that contains it more unused to two and
a half inch mounts and there are cable
tie points all around the edges speaking
of unused two and a half inch amounts we
counted five and yet the SSD that
shipped with the system was installed in
one of the three and a half inch bays
and at five it's about a three plus two
configuration depending on how you add
them up as we noted earlier the fan hub
used in the dtw one is almost identical
to the one that Lian Li has used in the
past one key difference is that the Liam
II controller has a PWM input to control
fan speeds via the motherboard while the
Walmart variant uses the cable for
manual LED control
instead that means there's no way to
control case fan speeds at all the fan
connectors are non-standard so they
cannot be directly connected to the
motherboard to bypass the hub it's
unclear what speed the case fans run at
or whether they're being run at their
maximum capacity there's no labeling on
the fans so we don't even know their
specs the fans also don't have any kind
of diffusing layer over their LEDs
likely Emily as borås do so the lighting
effect is a scattering of bright points
rather than a smooth rein but at least
that's clearly shown on the product page
the front i/o is unremarkable over all
other than three USB 2.0 ports the dtw
ones a motherboard does indeed have a
USB 3.0 header but that's for the full
system and we review in the case today
either way though if you missed it that
header is connected to a USB type-c
expansion card at the rear of the case
which is why you don't see any 3.0 at
the front IO a section of the case
getting into the thermal section this
one's pretty straightforward we're just
testing it stock and then we're testing
it again without the front panel at all
removing the glass panel and still using
all the stock fans for CPU torture
testing the Walmart case with our
standardized test bench immediately
positions itself at the bottom of the
stack alongside the n1 805 infinity and
Inman 303 which has no fans the
difference here is that the Walmart case
has four included fans all of which are
thoroughly suffocated by the front panel
that glass panel that's screwed in what
isn't shown by this chart is that the
CPU thermal result of seventy three
point four degrees over ambient is
actually after thermal throttling in
reality we're in the 90s and that's
after clock drops from bouncing off of
t.j.maxx on the CPU the case failed this
test midway and had to be shut down as
it was exceeding safe thermal ranges and
just to really illustrate the point
removing the front panel instantly drops
our operating temperature to 45 degrees
over ambient on the CPU a reduction of
nearly 30 degrees this is the most
egregious instance of a suffocating
front panel we've yet seen and blows
away the differences we saw in the
original H 500 P last year we've never
seen a case with airflow this choked off
by paneling by removing the panel the
case ranks alongside some of the best
cooled cases we've worked with which
isn't saying anything other than that
for fans and no front panel really does
pretty well that's because the brute
force schooling offered by those four
fans without an obstructing panel is
naturally going to cool things down a
bit
even the idle temperatures are high in
the unmodified tests of the Walmart case
which in itself is a tremendous feat
it's an accomplishment really to run
idle temperatures as high as this case
is here's a chart showing thermal
throttling on the CPU clock where we
occasionally drop down to thirty five
hundred megahertz from forty four
hundred megahertz now keep in mind that
this case is bundled with an 8700 and
it's not something you can buy
standalone in any way
also the 8700 isn't over clocked in any
way because it can't be so it's not as
dire for the stock use case when you
would buy this system but it's also
objectively a hot case GPU thermals are
where we really start to realize those
losses from the high temperatures if
you've never seen a Y running so hot
it's problematic
aside from increasing noise levels and
diminishing product longevity on things
like 85 C capacitors we can show that
there's actually performance loss too
after this chart our test GPU is a GT X
1080 gaming X for all of these test
cases and that runs at 62 degrees over a
means in the full stock configuration
this isn't the worst GPU temperature
we've seen but the card is throttling a
bit will show that momentarily the stock
results plant this one right around
where the BitFenix answer lands which
was one of the more constrained cases is
to say the least that we reviewed last
year coincidentally it also had a
completely obstructed front panel on
that BitFenix and so removing the panel
against the Walmart thermals down to
forty nine point nine degrees over
ambient again that's using our
standardized test bench not the native
computer that came in it this plant sat
at around results 42 on our table of
over 160 results for case thermals and
is heavily truncated chart though for
space we ended up near the Roseville
Cullinan which is actually a pretty good
case overall as for those throttling
charts here they are the stock Walmart
case drops about one hundred megahertz
off of the GPU clock with the front
panel installed whereas the panelists
Walmart case is tied in frequency with
the chart-topping 1/2 X that impact will
manifest itself in frame rate when the
panel is present
and one of the Walmart skews does indeed
include a hotter card than the one we're
testing here today that's the gtx 980ti
and will hopefully test that soon for a
less abusive test we turn to 3dmark fire
strike extreme as a stand-in for a
gaming workload there's one positions
the GPU as among the worst results in
our thermal testing for cases right next
to the poorly performing BitFenix and so
and antic p8 both of which were
lambasted appropriately more importantly
look closely at the CP results and
you'll see that the Walmart case is the
only one which breaks 40 degrees over
ambient this is a GPU intensive load so
to see this sort of thermal results for
the CPU indicates difficulty exhausting
hot air from the case for a CPU only
workload we turn next to blender
rendering within the Walmart PC case
this one position is the Walmart DT WK
is at 49 degrees over ambient 4cb
temperature marketed as the single worst
case and all of the results and by a
fairly wide margin the next worst is the
Corsair spec for a $40.00 case that
comes with one fan and which Newegg
recently struggled to even give away for
blender GPU thermals the Walmart case
ends up at 32 degrees over ambient which
is around the BitFenix n so once again
it seems the Walmart case possesses
similar GPU thermal characteristics to
the Enzo whereas the CPU does far worse
by comparison CPU thermals remain the
highest of any blender result yet even
though the CPU isn't even being loaded
here it's not doing anything that's just
the CPU pulling in all of the hot
exhaust from the GPU and then struggling
to dissipate it because of the air path
noise levels in the Walmart dtw case
aren't the worst we've seen but they are
the worst we've seen when considering
the ratio to thermal performance for the
decibel the DTW is the worst we've
tested and that includes a case in our
thermal charts that doesn't even have a
fan in it
the dtw ends up at 39.7 DBA putting it
alongside the NZXT eh 500 a case which
is thermally superior in all tests so
that's the case it's about the worst
thermally performing case we've tested
just like the aged 500 P non match the
original H 500 P the big thing to look
at is the Delta with the panel vs.
without the panel and in this case we're
seeing like 30 degree differences on the
CPU which is matte
that's crazy you should never have a
delt of that big because that just shows
how much the front panel is limiting the
cable this system actually does kind of
okay when you remove that glass panel
which is the same story we've been tying
with a lot of the aftermarket cases but
this one just really just exaggerated
the problem because how little depth
there is for those fans to exercise
their ability to bring Aaron there's
just not enough static pressure
performance when you're fighting a wall
of glass with four millimeters between
the fan on the glass so certainly not so
good you remove the panel it's actually
pretty pretty okay
that's fine it's in the middle top half
the pack somewhere in there it's found
which chart you're looking at so I guess
the bigger problem with this is if you
ignore it as a standalone product we're
saying you look back at the full system
assembly if you're buying the after-tax
where we are anyway 22:52 2252 dollar
system and you get this case with it
kind of a ripoff because this is
functionally a $60 case if you could buy
it retail that's about where it would
stand and it's it's not good so not a
good combination for a two thousand plus
dollar system it has to be a little bit
more airflow there especially because
they're running a 1080 TI in that system
we only have a 1080 in our test band for
cases 1080i is going to generate more
heat and that's a problem for something
that's thermally constrained but as a
standalone case this is the kind of
thing where we'd say like thermal is
pretty bad but if you could replace the
front panel it might be okay as a
50-dollar ultra budget case it's not the
worst thing we've ever worked with
internally a kill management's actually
fine it's not not bad at all
cutouts could be in better places on the
motherboard side but on the backside
there's enough depth to work with and I
mean all the stuff is where it should be
I don't know I don't know how much more
credit I can really give them so yeah
thermally it's it's awful terrible worst
performing we've ever worked with in an
impressive way but otherwise it's not
horribly offensive I guess maybe a
better front panel would do the case a
lot of good because
if the if Walmart could replace the
front panel now their systems depent
which one it is
the 1078 700 SKU it's not overheating
really in a massive way but you start
pushing 1080i in there and it is gonna
drop clocks a little bit so that's it
for this one though kind of fun to look
at as a standalone product just to see
what would happen if you could buy this
thing standalone and maybe you can or
will be able to at some point because
it's just a supplier made case and
that'll eventually hit the channel so

directly go to store it I can't razaaq's
is dotnet to pick up a mod mat or one of
our shirts and keep an eye out for more
