a struggle it was some parts human error
on our end and some parts mechanical
error this thing is a $100 cooler from
Aliexpress it's the PC cooler all
lowercase W 120 and it uses both
open-loop cooling liquid and a few air
cooling components as well like
traditional heat pipes with a fan we had
some small leaks during our live stream
and after the stream we discovered that
the screws securing the inlet manifold
were actually loose on the tower causing
significant leakage as water filled the
pipes after fixing this we were finally
able to test this truly unique hybrid
water / air cooler to its fullest
potential
before that this video is brought to you
by the new gamers and access blueprint
logo shirt which features a Jian logo
made in CAD software using accurate
angle and length measurements for the
drafted lines in the design just for fun
this blueprint logo is placed on a
heather true royal shirt by Bella in
canvas and is 52% heirloom cotton with
48 percent polyester we use tear away
labels that are easily removed the print
is an opaque ink that pops vibrantly on
the shirt and fits with our blueprint
theme and the shirts are extremely
comfortable thanks to the heather dual
blend materials and feel lightweight and
well fitted to wear pick one up at store
doc gamers nexus net or at the link
below first off we're probably doing a
teardown as either a live stream or a
separate video so you'll want to check
that because I know I want to see what's
inside of the cooler and how the cold
plates design so we'll have a separate
video doing a teardown of it make sure
you do check back for that other than
that though it's a really interesting
product it's actually been pretty fun to
work with just because it's so unique
and weird and you know they never sold
any of these things because it was $100
it was launched like or show it seven
years ago at Computex at 2018 - seven
years so I guess coffee tax 2011 and
inside the box when we opened it
it's got like yellowing from aged the
thermal paints that came with it was
completely hardened and basically
unusable so it's been sitting on a shelf
for a long time at this point probably
not the most successful product but a
very interesting one and that's why it
was fun to test so the PC cooler w 120
hundred bucks it comes with the
fan that's actually pretty high CFM but
it is a bit noisy and other than that
it's got a couple of liquid tubes in the
middle of the fin stack that are used
for actual water cooling you can hook it
up by normal fittings even to standard
ek or Thermaltake or whatever other
components you want to use so very
interesting then you could also use it
as a straight air cooler if you want
that we haven't tested that yet we do
plan to however it's just that at some
point it's not really going to be much
better than the low end of liquid
coolers and you'll see that as we go
through the numbers today so aside from
our own incompetence during the stream
and problems with just setting the
cooler up in general the thing did
actually have a few problems mainly
being the cold plate on the underside
the contact side the IHS has a bit of
wear on it so it's got some staining or
some corrosion and that limits its
ability to conduct and then the thermal
paste was no good so we did a test with
that and then a test with our
standardized paste and then also the
screws on the top of the manifold for
the intake for water or loose which
caused it to leak massively and that was
kind of figured out and solved easily
once it was figured out but now it's
time to go through the test so for
testing we have one chart we'll go
through with just the W 120 results to
make it easy but the tests are basically
noise normalized as always we have stock
thrown paste from them we have our own
thermal hay so we've got adding a 360
radiator to it to see if that helps at
all and then I always normalize with the
radiator as well so let's start off with
just the W 120 results and then go from
there in full stock configuration
including the stock age hardened thermal
paste the cooler kept the CPU at about
sixty point seven degrees Celsius over
ambient which is one of the worst
results we've recorded on this bench
remember this is without any radiators
and just a straight pump to and from the
cooler pump and reservoir in this case
the stock fan is mounted to the fin
stack and pushes across the water pipes
and the normal heat pipes replacing that
they're all pasted dropped temperatures
by six degrees as always with our
cooling testing this was conducted with
multiple repetitions on an average
adults were consistent with a 6-degree
reduction against the included paste
each time for reference we also have a
photo of the cooler with the original
paste after removal so you can clearly
tell how hard into the paste had become
and how it's basically cured to a point
of limiting its thermal efficacy of the
compound back to the chart a stock test
with our standardized thermal paste at
us at 54 degrees over ambience adding a
thermal take 360 radiator and three high
end fans to Corsair ml's and one Noctua
a 12 resulted in a reduction over 10
degrees Celsius this is more a testament
to the fans and radiator than anything
and rising water temperatures required
the extra cooling power directed
straight at the liquid noise normalized
the stock setup operated at 58 degrees
with the radiator version at 45 degrees
moving on is a comparative data with
other coolers the PC cooler W 120 using
our controlled standardized paste and no
radiator landed between an NZXT m22 120
millimeter closed-loop cooler and EVGA
CLC 120 at a lower rpm this place is the
W 120 as well below the X 42 the NZXT
one with a very low fan speed of 10 50
rpm and also below the 92 $100 courser h
100 IV 2 at low rpms the lower rpms
limit the cooling power of these
products but it also means that our
noise levels are well below the W 120 s
noise levels adding a radiator boosted
us to H 100 IV to performance with the
PC cooler product with the age 100 IB 2
at 1500 rpm at 41 degrees over ambient
for each this is still unimpressive for
the PC cooler w 120 particularly given
the overall quality difference between
them favoring Corsair massively the 360
radiator and high on fans we equipped
are being outmatched by cheaper coolers
and worse fans which means that we're
having trouble with cooling the cold
blades we'll be opening up the cooler
separately to investigate if there are
any micro fins at all in the cold blade
or if there's anything good in general
in there
we're bottle knocked out the w1 20s :
pipes for sure for our next test we
normalized all coolers to 40 DBA of
output which ensures that we test on
somewhat level footing for
noise output most people tune their fan
speeds to tolerable noise levels so this
allows quieter coolers to spin faster
and cool better while louder coolers
will be quieted to meet our noise
requirement in the middle the result is
a test of overall cooling efficiency
versus a fixed noise level at 40 DBA the
PC cooler W 120 without a radiator at
all operated at the bottom of the chart
at 58 point 2 degrees Celsius over
ambient and this is the worst device
we've tested yet at 40 DBA anyway and
operates even behind the 120 closed-loop
liquid coolers like the EVGA LC 120 and
NZXT M 22 which I've rated at 49 degrees
and 54 degrees respectively the W 120 is
significantly worse for noise normalize
testing although its ban pushes a lot of
air it's loud and uses cheap bearings in
plastic and also proves turbulent
through the fin stack this produces a
lot of noise that could be avoided with
a better design like from one of the
more mainstream companies with a 360
millimetre fat Thermaltake radiator
attached using two Corsair ml fans and
one knock to a 1/12 fan the PC cooler w
128 adapt 45 degrees over ambience at
this point the radiator is doing the
bulk of the cooling as our water
temperature measurements indicated that
the cooler doesn't dissipate enough heat
to keep liquid temperatures low more on
this momentarily with the radiator the W
120 stars costing beyond $200 but it
performs about equivalently to a crack
and X 40 to 140 millimeter CLC and other
$100 coolers like the H 100 Ivy 2 at 40
DB a water temperature measurements were
conducted with a k-type thermocouple
placed within the pump and reservoir
combo unit from thermal take this
measured distilled water as it returned
into the inlet from the cooler over time
we can see that the blue line
representing the cooler with no radiator
but with our standard paste slowly rises
to about 36 degrees the red line
representing the three sixty millimeter
radiator test only rises to 24 degrees
note that ambient temperature was 21
degrees we're not trying delta T values
here
just straight temperature from the probe
we have adjusted with an offset as
appropriate and finally the orange line
representing the original pace
illustrates that we have a clear problem
with getting heat into the cold plate
and getting rid of it effectively where
we rise almost
nearly noise levels at max rpm for the
w124 at 48.5 DBA equal with the x42 at
max rpm and the x42 and other nearby
coolers and noise are all superior in
thermals making this one a hard sell
from any perspective so that's it that's
the PC cooler W 120 really interesting
product and definitely fun to work with
not at all something we can reasonably
recommend to you it comes with pretty
low end or chiefly made parts anyway
doesn't work particularly well does
worse than jeepers coolers on the market
and it starts really adding up because
it's $100 for the cooler but then you
supply your own pump and radiator it
doesn't come with one your own tubes
your own liquid all that stuff if you
want a radiator with fans that's on you
as well and clearly that has a massive
impact here to a point of actually
making it a usable product but at that
point you really might as well just put
a water block on it and be done with it
and get rid of the tower cooler although
it is certainly unique and interesting
leakage a potential concern just go
through all the screws and make sure
they're tight before you start working
on it and then do a leak test and you'll
be good to go there so now we wouldn't
recommend it it is however very
interesting and fun to work with and
that's it for the BC cooler W 120 as
always you can help us out by
