video other than a lot of people kept
asking for it this is a quick look at
some of the benchmark performance for an
Intel processor one before and after the
Windows patch the security patch now
here's why there's not a lot of point to
the video the number one reason is that
we're still waiting on Intel for
microcode or firmware updates which will
likely be pushed out with motherboard
vendors support websites and on Intel's
own Download Center this means that
there could be changes from these
numbers we're seeing today everything
could be different the reason we're
testing it today this is just an a/b
test of before the latest Microsoft
Windows patch for the security issue
meltdown and potentially Spectre
although that needs more work and
establish a baseline before and after
hasn't done anything before the firmware
from Intel and then once that firmware
comes out we can look at it again with a
fuller picture and likely see the the
results that would be more or less
expected before that this video is
brought to you by EVGA and the X 299
dark motherboard for the Intel high-end
desktop CPUs the X 299 dark is one of
the only motherboards on the market with
proper vrm cooling we've tested this and
found a significant performance increase
over those without active cooling on the
prm's this board was used in our recent
attempt to set a top-10 record in fire
strike and you can learn more about the
x-29 dark at the link in the description
below so it's still worth doing this
test
fortunately almost all of our CB testing
is automated which means that it's
couple button clicks and recording some
data so we were able to run through the
bench suite that we normally use and
just validate note that these numbers
are not comparable with previous CB
benchmark numbers we've published
because we're doing a few things
differently different ram different OS
different drivers all that stuff this
was a very quick complete clean install
brand-new windows install and then we
tested with the version from december
and the version from the other day
and it's just an a/b test we're only
doing 7700 K right now we've got CES in
a couple days we're leaving so this is
what we can do for now so let's just go
through these quickly I guess you can
expect the results pretty much at this
point will be largely all the same
because consumer workloads shouldn't
really be affected too much by this
latency change and then the the firmware
will if any changes to be expected will
be responsible for most of that as far
as why this is all happening check out
our video on meltdown inspector that'll
get you up to speed on why we're here
today
and just quickly to note the reason any
performance degradation would be
expected at all is because theoretically
because the meltdown fix requires
introducing steps to check for
vulnerabilities you're increasing your
latency to move stuff around work with
memory so theoretically you have a
higher latency you might have lower
performance as a result some numbers
reported online were 5 to 30 percent
performance deficit but note again that
those numbers reported by gr security
were for primarily one Linux benchmark
and every number thus far reported for
most stuff in the consumer space has
been it's all the same we haven't seen
much for production so we'll start with
that and then go from there so for the
7700 K on the gaming 7 motherboard we
first tested Cinebench with our
automated suite we observed a score of
198 for single-threaded performance
across all tests with differences inside
of margin of error we also observed
roughly equivalent performance for the
multi-threaded test also inside margin
of error for this particular application
pov-ray placed us at 123 seconds elapsed
on all multi-threaded render tests or
about 554 seconds elapsed for the single
threaded test this is basically a
rendering benchmark so once again
there's no change here this had us at
about 20 128 to 2131 pixels per second
multi-threaded and 472 to 473 pixels per
second single threaded
once again no appreciable change n1
which is within margin of error fire
strike has a lot of variants but
we run it a couple times firestrike had
our FPS scores as on this chart again no
change not even close to a change and
times by showed the same no change
between 16 to 99.1 9 to Windows version
and 16 to 99.1 to 5 Windows version
blender 2.78 a had us at 42 minutes
render time with the GN monkeyhead test
which is equal between both windows
version tests we also observed 37
minutes for blender 2.79 and the monkey
heads or about 47 minutes for the GN
logo render and 3.79 once again no
change even on this somewhat large time
scale as for a few games we saw no
appreciable difference in ashes of the
singularity where we measure differences
within a margin of error don't go
running to Reddit with this 1 FPS
difference though claiming that one is
faster than the other they are well
within test variants they are
functionally the same watchdogs 2 also
proved the equal the differences were
functionally zero literally zero in the
case of average FPS and nearly zero in
the case of 1% and 0.1% lows finally
civilization six times the complete
turns is also about the same at 17 0.76
to 17 point 8 seconds per turn this is
with invariance and our difference is 4
hundredths of a second at this point so
we're back to the intro of the video
what does this mean the answer is
nothing all it means is that if you
updated your Windows version for the
tests we've done on the CPU we tested
you can expect no change that does not
mean that there is no change to
performance following the patches and it
does not mean that we can extrapolate
anything and following the January I
believe its ninth updates as that's when
the major embargo lifts and not an
embargo that we were included in by the
way this is an embargo for hardware and
software companies so we actually for
once have no idea what is contained
within that embargo we'll find out when
you do so yeah again all we're seeing
here is that the current Windows version
doesn't have appreciable nor measurable
different
is between the most recent December
version of Windows and although they
weren't included in these charts
comparing a couple of quick ad hoc tests
versus our tests from before fall
creators update again basically no
difference so the windows update alone
does not appear to have changed
performance in these tests and games
it's possible there are changes to
performance in other tests and games
however I would suppose that a lot of
those are more likely the result of
other changes to Windows outside of the
security patch that Microsoft put out
remember this is not a patch that
contains only a fix for the Intel and
AMD and whatever the meltdown inspector
bug and these not really included in
meltdown but you get the idea it
contained a lot of other stuff too just
like all Microsoft patches do so we
won't know more until January 9th for
now looks fine but there is plenty of
room for that to change when the new
firmware comes out or the microcode and
whatever else may be done at that point
so we'll see performance could always
get worse it could also remain
completely stagnant but there's no room
to really speculate on that for now so
we'll keep you posted we're gonna be at
CES when the embargo lifts for the
hardware and software vendors on what
they're doing so we won't be able to
test it immediately we will be able to
talk with them at CES if the topic is
still of interest and if we think they
can actually provide an answer to any of
the questions so stay tuned for that
