controller protocol is one of the
Keystone's to the Vega architecture
marked by RTG lead Raja Kaduri as a
personal favorite feature of Vega and
highlighted in previous marketing
materials as offering a potential 50%
performance uplift in average FPS when
in vram constrained scenarios and you
can see up to 50 ports on average FPS
improvement and actually more
importantly almost 2 X min FPS with a
few driver revisions now behind us we're
revisiting our Vega 56 hybrid card to
benchmark HPCC in a B fashion testing
and memory constraint scenarios to
determine advocacy and real gaming
workloads before we get into that this
content is brought to you by the
Thermaltake flow RGB closed-loop liquid
cooler which is a 360 millimetre
radiator plus 3 120 fans that are RGB
illuminated the if-then we'll take it
rain fans at that this is a 4.5 gen edge
detect pump which is one of the faster
pumps you can learn more at the link in
the description below HPCC is the
controller for Andy's high bandwidth
cache what the company has functionally
renamed its vram 2 so there's no hard
threshold as to what governs the high
bandwidth cache naming you could have
for example a Vega GPU with gddr5 memory
and if that hypothetical card existed it
would still be considered high bandwidth
cache it doesn't need to be HP m in
order to be HPC under Andy's new naming
scheme and the HPCC protocol so this is
a look at the HPCC controller which is
toggleable through the AMD drivers that
is disabled by default and we're using
17 10.1 but there is a new 17.10.2011 so
the results are based on that as for the
cache controller when enabled the
controller effectively converts vram
into a last level cache and will tap
into system memory as a sort of expanded
video memory in this scenario if the
applications page out of the on card 8
gigabytes of HP on to a trade-off
between latency and capacity occurs
and the GPU taps into system memory to
grab its needed pages if you're storing
4k textures in HP m2 and exceed that 8
gigabyte capacity for example and then
maybe need another one gigabyte for
other assets those items can be pushed
onto system memory and then pulled via
the PCIe bus this is less effective than
increasing on card memory but it's
significantly cheaper than doing so and
it's not always possible to increase the
on card memory due to either physical
space limitations or memory controller
limitations things like that this is
even in spite of DDR pricing right now
and expanding its a system memory isn't
a new thing for really any type of
technology when looking at a GPS and ap
use but it does enable Vega to
potentially expand the working area for
data when it's dealing with larger data
sets something that Vega has really
targeted since the beginning latency is
introduced to by means of traveling
across the PCIe interface through the
CPU and down the memory bus and then
back again but it's still faster than
having to dump memory and swap data
locally hypothetically this technology
would permit large working data sets to
exist on system memory and give the GPUs
memory controllers somewhat direct
access to that data set although it's
worse for latency technically speaking
the additional capacity should outweigh
that latency deficit in the right
scenarios so it's going to take proper
implementations to ever realize the
gains and that implementation must
happen at both the software developer
and AMD levels of deployment and the
first showcase this technology in a tech
demo in March around when Rison was
launching and they showed HPCC on vs.
off with a hypothetical vega card that
didn't come to exist and probably won't
or at least if not anytime soon that
card was a 4 gigabyte vega GPU with an
unspecified shader count so it is a 4
gigabyte card as opposed to the modern 8
on both 64 and 56 and because it was 4
gigabytes it was far more likely to
become memory constrained than something
with 8 it's pretty hard to fill an 8
gigabyte frame buffer with video games
or even synthetic benchmarks so it makes
sense that in order to showcase the
difference you would do something like
use a 4 gigabyte card unfortunately we
don't presently have a good
way of constraining our cards to four
gigabytes like an attack demo but we
have some ideas potentially for the
future we'll see if they work or not
though
but either way when they showcase this
Deus Ex mankind divided showed the
differences of about 50% in average FPS
according to Andy and they 100%
improvement in minimums so and these
showing averages got a 50% increase in
performance by enabling HB CC which
expanded the effective vram we'll call
it that Vega could tap into when working
with the games data set that would
include things like textures for example
now this is disabled by default
it's been tested in the past around
launch we figured we'd revisit it with
some newer drivers and see if anything's
changed we are using all the components
to find in the article below and the
testing methods are there as well along
with all the components used but for the
most important components 3200 megahertz
of CL 16 memory is being used we have 32
gigabytes of it available to the system
and of that depending on the scenario
we're expanding and the Vega 56v Ram
allocation to an effective 18 Giga bytes
with HPCC on except in shadow of war
where we only expand it to 12 gigabytes
because we wanted to make sure there was
enough memory there to work with the 4k
special texture pack because there can
be issues if if not it just won't load
them and you may not even notice it so
let's get started we're looking at not
just the theoretical but the practical
performance from HB CC and that means
we're looking primarily at gaming and at
synthetic workloads to really drill down
into differences and build our accuracy
and confidence we first started with
fire striking scripted execution of 20
test passes with HB CC on and HPCC off
using another in-house script to export
and analyze all that data there's some
variants but this many test passes will
average it out we plotted a standard
deviation of 20 7.48 points with HB CC
off and 35.8 points with HB c is he on
as for the scoring the HPCC off tests
were 19400 18 point 1 3 points
where
HPCC on with 18 gigabytes allocation
scored 19,000 683 this marks HPCC
enablement as providing a 1.37
performance improvement over HPCC off
which manifests itself as a boost in FPS
which we've charted of 93.8 FBS average
versus 95 point 2 FPS average for GT 1
and seventy six point eight versus
seventy-seven point eight for GT two
again this is over 20 test passes for
each benchmark so we can be pretty
certain that within the parameters of
our test system and Windows this is a
repeatable difference and is outside of
variance of just the firestrike
application times pi underwent the same
treatment using the same script for its
repeated execution we found much closer
scores for this one with the average
graphics score at sixty sixty-two point
three for HPCC disabled or sixty ninety
four point three seven for HBC C enabled
that grants HPCC an advantage of 0.53%
repeatably and translates into a scoring
of 41 0.7 FPS average versus forty one
point nine for gt1 and favoring HPCC
enabled it's also thirty three point two
FPS versus thirty three point three nine
for GT two again favoring enabled
superposition is our next synthetic test
offering a look at performance scaling
from the eyes of Unigine rather than
future mark superposition wasn't
repeated as many times but we do have
five test passes for each configuration
with minor standard deviations of two
point nine points for HPCC on and one
point four points for HPCC off and this
is on a scale of many thousands of
points so a deviation of one is really
pretty good this application is
impressively consistent in scoring HPCC
off results in a score of 30 for 84
points in superposition as opposed to
3624 with HPCC enabled and that's a
1080p extreme the performance difference
amounts to a four percent improvement
which is the biggest we've measured thus
far of course we're so bound by other
elements of the card like the core
frequency streaming processors Rob's so
forth that a four percent improvement is
only represented by a one FPS increase
because we're just choking everywhere
else and can't really realize that gain
in a meaningful way as for frequency
using stock settings
enabling HPCC plotted a stable frequency
of about 13 10 to 13 25 megahertz for
the first half of the test while
disabling HPCC plotted a more variable
but higher frequency of 1315 to 1352
megahertz this is repeatable and
happened effectively every time and we
weren't really trying to control for
that frequency change because we were
interested in how the card behaved when
HPCC was on versus off and this was part
of that behavior and observation of that
behavior despite the slight frequency
deficit on the HPCC enabled test it was
a bit more consistent and a card
ultimately managed to improve
performance by a few percentage points
overall looking like about 4 in this
case Sniper Elite 4 is our first game
benchmark at 4k with high settings
DirectX 12 and async compute we found
performance to be functionally equal
between the HPCC a/b tests with HPCC on
blotting 52.7 FPS averaged 46 points to
under sound lows and 45 is 0.7 lows
disabling HPCC landed us at 52 point 2
FPS average of 0.5 FPS difference forty
five point nine one percent lows and
forty four point eight FPS 0.1% lows not
only is there no discernible difference
there's no difference outside of usual
deviation and error margins so we can't
actually say whether there's an
improvement here it just kind of looks
all the same moving into ashes of the
singularity with DirectX 12 4k
resolution and high settings we mostly
saw the same these results had us at
sixty six point six FPS average to sixty
six point nine FPS average with forty
four point three to forty three point
five one percent lows and 41 verses
forty 0.1% lows for the FPS once again
these are within test a test deviation
Ghost Recon wildlands at 4k plots the
HPCC tests at 36 FPS average with HPCC
on and off with lows largely tied at 33
and thirty two point five were 32 and 31
point eight F yes so all pretty much the
same numbers there's no appreciable
difference here and we are once again
within variance we also saw no
difference at 1080p that that's less
significant given the diminished focus
on memory at this
but pretty much the same results if you
were curious about 1080p for honor at 4k
and using extreme settings makes for one
of the more memory intensive real-world
to games that we work with they go with
HB CC enabled bought at a 43 FPS average
versus 42.7 when disabled marking these
scores functionally equivalent and with
invariance the lows are forty point
seven FPS versus forty point three and
thirty nine point three zero point one
percent lows versus 38 once again all
this is within test deviation and
variance for this particular title at
1080p for honor has us at 125 FPS
average for both HPCC enabled and
disabled we would expect less likelihood
for differences to emerge have these
lower resolutions given the vram users
reduction we configure to help lead to
4k with very high settings providing one
of the more taxing games for testing a
vago 56 card under both HPCC conditions
performance was exceptionally consistent
and plotted about the same numbers
between HPCC on and off once again for
held late at 4k testing shadow of war
with the normal texture pack 4k
resolution and high settings we were at
42 to 43 FPS average on both iterations
of the HPCC testing marking equal
performance once again we later enabled
the 4k texture pack and ran ultra
settings with HPCC reconfigured to a 12
gigabyte frame buffer to preserve ram
for the pack just in case though
settings gave us once again about the
same performance between our HPCC on and
off tests consulting the work of friend
of the site rob williams over at tech
age it looks like they found pretty much
the same results when the card first
shipped or close to it anyway their
results for the most part featured
basically the same plus or minus 1 FPS
within error types of differences and
they did also test mankind divided which
we didn't do for this one and tech gauge
didn't measure any meaningful change
with the 8 gigabyte Vega cards but like
we were saying at the beginning of this
content the article and the video it
looks like perhaps there would be a
bigger difference if you could restrict
Vega to 4 gigabytes so this HPCC
control the toggle for the controller
may come into play more if either a 4
gigabyte
vega cart comes into existence which
would be an awfully interesting
combination the price of HBM at four
gigabytes i don't know we'll see if it
works out if it ever actually exists but
that would be a scenario where you would
potentially see a difference and you
certainly showed that in their tech demo
we can't recreate it because we only
have the cards that exist on the market
which are 8 gigabytes and the other
option would be potentially if somehow
games just started storing tons and tons
of data into vram in the immediate
future or maybe if you resurrect these
cards and several years when probably
they are end-of-life for various other
reasons maybe at that point because of
technology changes and shifts in game
development you might see implementation
of or actually utilization rather of
that expanded memory or effective memory
on the video card what we haven't tested
is production level applications I'm not
sure if tech gauge has tested that yet
or if they plan to but production
applications are a potential area where
there might also be gains Andy has its
own SSG solution for that space
particularly with things like live 8k
scrubbing and premiere with the SSG
Radeon cards so there may be some kind
of impacts in production level workloads
but for gaming we're not really seeing
anything right now in the games we've
tested it does look like superposition
plots a somewhat statistically
significant change in that we're seeing
a four percent uplift with HPCC the only
problem there is that by the time we're
tapping into that advantage the extra
four percent advantage we're so limited
elsewhere in the pipeline that it's just
as a player if you could play the game
superposition if it were a game at the
point that the advantage is coming into
play you're already at such a low FPS
that it's unplayable anyway so you'd
actually be better off just lowering
your settings sacrificing the advantage
and running with something that's a bit
easier for the card to work with the
exception would be if you had a workload
that had a very memory intensive set of
assets like maybe 8k text
or something we haven't tried for
example modding fallout or Skyrim if any
of you have let us know what your
results were but those would be
scenarios where you could definitely
pump the memory usage on the video card
with user created assets that are one
less optimized and two don't have the
same considerations that game developers
have in terms of capacity console
compatibility things like that so they
can go heavier on the memory consumption
on the video card so those would be all
the scenarios where you might see an
uplift for the stuff we've tested thus
far we're not seeing one so don't worry
about that toggle right now it's not
really worth turning it off you don't
really get a performance hit unless you
run into issues with system memory
limitations so from what we've seen that
you could probably turn it on and maybe
every now and then you'll get a 0.5 to 4
percent performance uplift it's not
really a bad thing but if you do
encounter stability issues obviously
it's also not a bad thing to just turn
it off and live without it so one of
those things where the technology is
there and it's kind of questionable when
it works but it seems to work in some
instances particularly synthetics so
those might be enough to encourage
turning it on but it's certainly not a
silver bullet for anything so that's all
for this one we'll revisit this as more
driver updates and games and
applications seem like they're using it
Wolfenstein 2 will be a potential option
for looking into this because Bethesda
has sort of cryptically stated that they
will be leveraging Vega to greater
levels than other games do currently
probably just because of olkin but we'll
see as always you can go to
