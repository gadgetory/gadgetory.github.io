gaming you know we care a little bit
about gaming and the fact of the matter
is although 25 years ago when we first
started this journey gaming was a niche
market but gaming is surely no longer
niche this is a pop culture now it is a
massive industry it is a global industry
it is a growing industry and frankly
everybody's a gamer just ask the
president you guys don't watch that show
and so what we think is that a set-top
box should also be able to gain and
would it be amazing though if we were
able to expand the reach of gaming now
quite frankly gaming on television today
is really about the console and the
console is fantastic for millions of us
will do anything to have a great gaming
experience however we can expand the
reach of gaming ten times a hundred
times if we can simply make it more
accessible so that it's click and
play-away just a click and a play away
we think that we can leverage somehow
the power of mobile cloud and do for
gaming what Netflix did for videos what
Spotify did for music we can really
expand the reach of gaming and so the
question then became how do we do that
well the first thing we have to do they
design a great processor we design the
Tegra x1 the Tegra x1 we call it a
mobile superchip this little tiny
processor this little tiny processor has
256
course I want to show you what it can do
in just a moment but just to give you a
sense of what it's performances we're
using a pretty old benchmark here I
could use a more modern bench warrant
but unfortunately many of those other
devices simply show up us do not run and
so I've used a relatively old benchmark
and this old benchmark will show that
we're about 35 times faster than the
Apple TV now you need that performance
you need 35 times faster than Apple TV
because you would like to have more and
more applications and some of those
applications report an enormous amount
of computational capabilities well being
faster than a smart TV device is good
but it surely isn't necessarily good
enough if you would like to have great
games you need to have a platform that
allows game developers to be able to
port and to be able to address to engage
so that they can deliver great games we
need to know that tx1 can deliver good
games well if you compare it to one of
the most popular game platforms in the
history of mankind you can see that this
little little tiny chip called tx1 with
256 maxwell GPU cores can deliver over
twice the performance of an xbox 360 and
at one-fifth the power at one fifth
power now the question is why is that
important well it turns out turns out
that about a hundred million people have
enjoyed console games of that generation
and yet there are well over a thousand
amazing titles created several billion
people should enjoy it how do we get
several billion people who all have
televisions to be able to enjoy the
thousand plus games that were
creative for that generation they are
still beautiful they're still amazing if
we gave them a platform that allows the
developers to simply remaster put it in
the cloud click and download and before
you know it you can now enjoy that
wonderful game for all of the people who
didn't go to the trouble of buying a
game console all those people who didn't
go through the trouble of digital
download at the time all those people we
did go through trouble of buying the DVD
tx1 and shield with 256 maxwell cores
and 3 gigabytes of memory makes it
possible for us to engage this new
market to expand the reach of gaming so
number one we have to build a great
processor number two the system has to
be designed to be incredibly powerful
now if you're a 3d graphics company you
got to do everything in 3d you know and
so maybe we'll just can we turn the
lights back on real quick so I feel good
you know give me a slide okay she in 3d</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
