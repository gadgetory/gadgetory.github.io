CES 2019 fantex has a lot of stuff
you've seen some of it you've requested
coverage of the P 600's which I'm
standing next to right now there's also
a new Lux case and then there's some new
metallic gear cases that we'll be
talking about as well in the back half
of this video but we're gonna start with
the P 600 s because it's been the most
heavily requested in the comments
section of our other case video that
went up earlier today before that this
video is brought to you by the gigabyte
Z 390 ARS master motherboard which comes
equipped with one of the more powerful
z3 90 V RMS for heavier overclocks on
the new 9th gen Intel CPUs the ARS
Master is also one of the few
motherboards with a really heatsink this
generation featuring a mix of high
surface area fins and looks oriented
hover blocks oh and it's also got
updated RDV illumination learn more at
the link below the P 600 ask first of
all first I need to know is if you're
familiar with the evolve X and the
evolve X is tooling you're already
familiar with this case so that sets
your foundation you already know
everything about the internals of the
chassis and if you saw our evolve X
review you can just pay attention to the
build section where we talk of internals
same idea applies here differences are
primarily external and then price is a
major difference as well so these will
be priced at 140 or 150 depending on the
SKU that you buy there are three
different colors available there's a buy
fantex naming scheme if I remember them
correctly there's anthracite which is
gray there's a satin black which
actually has a pretty nice finish on it
and then the white next move which I
think it's called glacier white so three
SKUs there there's a separate SKU with a
closed-off side panel so it's a steel
side panel rather than tempered glass
and that also has some sound damping
foam on the additional steel panel will
have some shot of pulling this off as
well but there's sound damping foam here
and on the top and then the the material
you see behind it is just a nylon which
is also on the Lux too we'll be looking
at later on so that nylon material we
haven't trust but verify they say so our
understanding presently is that the
airflow is it's a bit more forgiving on
air flow because it's more porous of a
material so we'll try and verify that in
the wind tunnel at some point if we ever
get a chance to do that because it makes
sense from a firm material standpoint so
paneling open up opens up just like that
with a pull tab you can stick that in
there if you wanna conceal
on the main case side everything's the
same internally power supply shrouds the
same you could still buy the additional
mini ITX bracket if you would like to
install mini ITX system inside of it
which is how this is configured with
functionally an integrated mass and that
particular setup makes some sense
because there is plenty of storage
options so there's included for 3.5 inch
drive mounts and then the rest you buy
separately as we discussed in the Evolve
extra view for the fans back for the
p600 ass it's 3 1000 RPM 140 millimeter
fans I think that covers most of this
case it's it's primarily about visuals
so what you see is what you get if you
ever I can tell you if you like it or
not but you can let us know in the
comment section what you think of this
pricing is the biggest change here so a
lot of you like the evolve X the evolve
X is definitely a high-end case 200
bucks or so when it came out quite a bit
more for the expansion options so if you
wanted an evolve X but for about $50
cheaper then I guess this would be your
option for the the chassis side of it
quick note before we move on to the luxe
2 and the budget class cases there are
water blocks now as well for 20 atti
cards so there's a Strix card block and
then there's also one for the extreme
and then interestingly both of those
allow support compatibility with the
stock back plate for the Strix and for
the extreme so we'll show some b-roll of
it not going to focus on that today
let's move on to the locks to case so
luxe 2 is on the higher end of the price
spectrum looking at about $190 this one
q2 for the target for the material as
the front and the top panel are 2
millimeter aluminum and the sides are
pretty good fake because they fit in
terms of the color and the matte of the
material because from a couple feet away
it tricked me it looked aluminum but it
is plastic sides and then on the
aluminum top and front the the fans so
let's go through the specs the the hard
data first fans will be 2 front fans
black included 1300 rpm rpm 140
millimeters for those and then there
will also be a rear fan and 140
millimeters for that as well
but the configuration here I think it's
for 120 s in the front and for 120 s in
the side mount this side mounting things
gotten popular in the last couple of
months we've seen a couple of thermal
take cases the the the well-known Lian
Li 11 dynamic did this as well
site intake in most of our testing works
pretty damn well as long as there's
something on the other side like a glass
panel just block it all and let it go
where it want where it wants the only
downside of a side intake is when you do
side intake without any front intake as
well to sort of make sure the air
doesn't escape out the front something
that we saw in one of the binax cases we
reviewed so this has got both options if
you want front or side it does support
for 120s again Comstock with 140s
on the rear side just kind of
interesting there's a window for the
SSDs so three SSD bracket or mounts on
the rear side with a window looking into
them they've got our GB LED ones and
here a button those there's the
popularity of those seems to be a bit
mixed so you can let us know what you
think of the RGB SSDs for the the mesh
again we see a return of the nylon
material we'll look into this more later
because it's it's an interesting topic
and something that fantex does it very
uniquely and we've got shots at the
interior as well but hundred ninety
bucks target quarter to four target
release date and the name is the lux too
so hopefully we have more information on
that later you can check links in the
description below last one to look at is
going to be the metallic gear cases for
the more budget oriented fantex lineup
it's a sort of sub brand or sister brand
of fantex that was announced I believe
at Computex of last year finally for the
metallic gear cases so from camera left
towards me the pricing fifty sixty
seventy dollars minus one penny easier
to say it that way so that's the pricing
for the cases there's the Neo silent
NeoAir and Neo G the positioning of them
is pretty straightforward silent is
going to have some of the sound damping
materials it comes with one fan stock
which aids a bit in the price so one fan
probably pre-installed in the rear for
stock the Neo air is a well we've got
two options here so there's a digital
RGB option for the Neo G and then RGB
for the Neo air in terms of the fan spec
the air comes with two 120 millimeter
RGB fans it will be available in white
and black for the case and then the Neo
G next to me here as opposed to the air
is a digital RGB system to 120
millimeter fans $70 to the price target
on that one and tooling is about 50/50
new versus versus reuse
parts so some of the tool and you might
be familiar with but these are the more
budget oriented cases this is kind of
similar to if you're wondering why why
metallic gear kind of similar to some of
the other brands we've seen in the past
like Kingston with HyperX is a good
example where they Kingston very much
wanted Kingston to be associated with
server enterprise that was their
business that's what they've always done
and what a hyper x-ray gaming metallic
here is kind of like the budget brand or
the more affordable brand gamer targeted
cases for fantex like you have land coal
previously with Lian Li where LAN Lee
didn't want they're all aluminium eight
million dollar case is associated with
$100 Gaming cases so they spun off land
cool so metallic gear if you're
wandering it's fantastic but that's what
they have here for these availability
for most of this stuff will include in
the article link in the description
below as well and I think that covers it
for the fans ex tweet so thank you for
watching you can subscribe for more as
always go to store dock Caymans Nexus
dotnet the hell is that directly thanked
and what do we have next I guess we have
AMD next so you'll definitely want to
check back for Andy because they have
some major announcements coming up for
the show I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
