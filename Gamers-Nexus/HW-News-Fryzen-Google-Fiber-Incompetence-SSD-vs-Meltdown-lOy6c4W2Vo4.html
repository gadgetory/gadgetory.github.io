a long CES this time and we have some
leftover news from CES along with other
industry goings-on last week including a
CPU cooler for thread Ripper and a m4
that's called the frozen cooler so
that's a name we're gonna be talking
about that
hades canyons some other stuff meltdown
my scathing review of Google Fiber that
we just posted on the website and a bit
more before that this video is brought
to you by thermal grizzly makers of the
conductor hot liquid metal that we
recently used to drop 20 degrees off of
our coffee leak temperatures thermal
grizzly also makes traditional thermal
compounds we use on top of the IHS like
cryo not and hydro not pastes learn more
at the link below
starting with some quick site news and
information on articles we've published
in the last week for those of you who
have ordered the GN mod mat the
anti-static mod mat we're are planning
to preorder one the pre-orders should
start shipping pretty soon we have them
on the way to us that'll be about 10 to
12 days from filming and then they'll
leave from us immediately and go out to
all of you so you should be getting on
pretty soon it'll just be going out by
normal shipping so depending what
country you're in the arrival time will
vary but they're almost here so that's
pretty exciting as far as other articles
on the site we just published something
on Google Fiber and our experience with
them thus far they are presently
challenging AT&amp;amp;T and spectrum aka Time
Warner on who can be the most
incompetent and god-emperor Google and
their thaumaturge have bestowed upon us
they're magical boxes that they call
fancy fancy tech speak aka a network box
that we're just waiting on them to sort
that out and get it all working it's
been a lot of fun for the last five
months though because I think we signed
up four or five or service after they
finished the street install in August
and we had a meeting with them in
November to finalize everything that
didn't happen and then another one that
didn't happen so we're still waiting on
fiber several months later even though
it's already on the street so if you're
interested in reading about that
experience it's on
website and fun fact after publishing
that tweeting it at Google and making
some noise about it publicly finally
we're getting service so apparently the
trick is the same as it is with AT&amp;amp;T and
Time Warner it's that if you can make
enough noise and you have some following
on social media good news
they'll help you out if not and you're a
small-time customer individual then
screw off we don't want to help here so
yeah not a great experience with Google
Fiber thus far they are not proving to
be any better than any of the other ISPs
though hopefully the network speeds will
make up for the incompetence but we'll
see it also come down to the sort of the
question you run into of how much
control do I really want Google to have
over my life you've got YouTube Adsense
the world's largest search engine that
drives all of your web traffic and then
phone if you have an Android phone and
Internet so it's getting to a point
where 80% of my existence is under
Google's domain if I start moving to
their Internet as well so it is starting
to get to a to a point where it's just
introspective like maybe maybe Time
Warner is not so bad
they suck their internet sucks but you
know they told me they'd be here between
6 a.m. and 8 p.m. and dammit they were
here between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. and they
installed the service and that I never
had to talk to them again and it's been
great for five years except for the slow
internet but it works and it's reliably
bad so it's there it's reliable I know
what to expect
I don't over expect anything because
they've conditioned me to expect nothing
good of them so you know it's maybe not
such a bad idea to just stick with them
anyway that articles on the on the
website if you want to read more gave me
an opportunity to vent with some
creative creative writing that I don't
normally get to use as I do with ISPs
also we published a keyboard review the
Cherry MX 6.0 if you're interested in
that Michael Kern's review is on the
website and he talked about his feelings
with that pretty high on the keyboard as
well as far as official news from the
show and other hangers-on
Fry's and electro is the name of a deep
cool cooler
now we're not positive if this will ever
come to market it seems they were asking
us to basically to give them feedback on
if we thought it was a good idea and ask
the viewers and readers to comment so if
if you like this cooler make sure you
let deep cool know so they can actually
bring it to market because CES has a lot
of prototypes but fries in is the name
of it that could probably some work it's
you know like frying risin I guess maybe
not fully thought through electro it's a
120 millimeter cooler
it supports thread Ripper it has a full
thread Ripper coverage plates OTR for
cold plate and it claims to also support
a m4 which makes sense as long as it's
not colliding with VR M's or anything
like that or DRAM or any any others
other nearby components should be fine
full-coverage six heat pipes apparently
it clears ram vertically so that
shouldn't be an issue and it also has an
exclusive metal fan frame which is just
a metal x over the fan I guess that
bumps on to the the top of the cold
plate for service area so that's the MF
120 GT fan on the fries in electro
cooler
let them know if you're interested might
not ever come to market but it was
interesting at least cuz thread if ur
coolers are kind of interesting given
their performance difference with cold
blade sizes another AMD news item this
is a bit newer and modus fused drive TM
is something that Andy just announced so
I'm gonna read what they said in their
vlog because it actually sums it up
pretty well without too much marketing
for for once from any company and it
says the short of it fuse drive analyzes
the storage hardware available on your
system from fastest to slowest so that's
DRAM cross point and via me drives hard
drives all that stuff and it's supposed
to during setup create or combine the
discs into a single larger disk which is
apparently a bit different from normal
caching scheme so that AMD claims that
fused Drive lets you use both the SSD
and hard drive capacity together as one
large boot drive for example combining
two drives ie
a 512 gigabyte SSD a 512 gigabyte
hard drive into one so it has some
parallels to obtain from what we've read
it seems like a potential and the answer
to obtain if anyone needed to answer
obtained and it's a paid solution so
it's 20 dollars for up to 128 gigabyte I
guess combined drive we're not fully
clear on that yet and two gigabytes of
what they call fuse Ram or $60 for one
terabyte and four gigabytes of the so
called fuse Ram so not fully sure what
to think of it yet we haven't tested it
don't know that we will but we've gotten
a couple of emails from you all about it
so we know there's interest anyway and
modus fuse drive you want to look it up
and see if it's suitable for your system
other items from CES be quiet so they
had a new dark rock 4 single tower
cooler at the show we didn't get to
check out this time but we'll probably
be reviewing it the dark rock 4 is
accompanied by the dark rock pro 4 and
they are a single tower cooler and a
duel tower cooler respectively the dark
rock pro 4 has two fin stacks it's got
two fans one of which is 135 millimeters
the other is 120 millimeters and the
dark rock non pro 4 is a 135 millimeter
silent Wayne's 3 fan and that's it 6
heat pipes on that one 200 watt TDP and
apparently now top mounting with 2
screws I think that's my understanding
as opposed to the previous awful
mounting mechanism of be quiet air
coolers it looks like they've they've
actually improved that quite a bit so
that's very good to hear because be
quiet we've we've told them for a long
time they've known for a long time it's
not like we're the first to tell them
they probably figured it out before they
shipped the things that the mounting
mechanism was the absolute worst part of
working with a be quiet cooler now once
it's installed you're fine but yeah so
they fixed that that's great to hear
meltdown and SSDs this was a topic we
were speaking with Alain mal ventano
about from PC perspective Allen writes
some of the best storage reviews in the
industry he's one of the only sources I
trust reading when it comes to storage
reviews because storage reviews are
actually really hard to do which is why
we don't really do SSD benchmarks they
get they get complicated fast so he
wrote an article not long ago where he
sort of a preliminary test on the change
to SSD speeds he's got a couple things
actually one is specifically testing
some meltdown patches versus SSD speeds
and the other one is a white paper that
they published and that contains
information on SSD performance testing
in general including for example large
performance swings by updated bios so
part of Allan's conclusion and one of
his pieces was that simply by updating
BIOS if you're not careful and you're
either a storage reviewer or you're
running benchmarks on your own SSDs
before and after
be aware that BIOS changes to P States
and C states could impact performance
more than anything else so just like any
other benchmark it's really hard to
control a lot of stuff sometimes if
you're updating BIOS you don't
necessarily know what the manufacturer
changed it's possibly changed some power
states in there and if they did you
could see swings from what Allan was
saying of up to 20% in performance for
storage and some specific applications
AS SSD is one of the applications that
Alan tested that proved to have some of
the biggest swings in performance if you
also ran some kind of application that
generated a load on the CPU so it's not
a great benchmark for that reason and
he's got a whole white paper that talks
about it and also some information on
the meltdown testing we're for
preliminary testing it looks like it's
kind of a wash there's some some gain
and some loss for performance with the
meltdown patches but it didn't look like
a huge deal for what Alan was testing
there are a lot more storage devices out
there a lot more BIOS revisions so
there's always room for change but it's
a great starting point if you want to
read their white paper I believe they've
got that published publicly as well and
it's definitely worth checking out if
you're interested in storage reviews and
why they are hard to do right and we
tried storage reviews a while ago a long
time when as these were pretty new it
was okay then but now with the way SSDs
have a local cache and things like that
they they behave a lot differently with
the software you use the test so you get
into scenarios where software
used for benchmarking could flood cash
in a way that's really not realistic and
may never be encountered by user data
looks a lot worse as a result so yeah we
haven't gotten back into it but if
you're interested in SSDs he's a good
source for that next is I will link that
down below as well or in the article
accompanying this next is the Hades
Canyon nook so this has been talked out
of it since CES but we'll throw our
information in as well there are two
models of the Hades Canyon Intel device
that was at the show they are $800 and
$1,000 I expected for first quarter of
this year and they are named nook 8i 7h
BK that's a 100 watt unit or 100 watt
TDP anyway and nook 8i 7h n K which is
65 watts the hvk is marketed as
supporting VR and it's OC ready due to a
larger footprint of the cooling solution
and the other one is not 50% graphics
improvement allegedly over the skull
canyon nook and replaceable lid
customizable RGB illumination if that's
your thin front panel RGB LEDs there's a
vase amount and KB like G CPUs which you
get a Vega M GPU with those so it
amounts to a Polaris GPU with HBM to
memory and we have a specs table on all
that that we can keep on the screen for
a while if you're curious about the
specs for the combined chip HTC had
major vive news at their CES press
conference primarily announcing the new
HTC vive pro and vive pro audio and a
wireless adapter the vive pro increases
display resolution from 2160 by 1200 to
2880 by 1600 and it still uses dual OLED
displays this should help resolve some
of the screen door effect problems with
VR particularly when reading text but we
haven't had a great amount of time to
try it out yet speaking of resolving
screen door issues the vibe should now
be seated more appropriately on your
face with better weight distribution
this is something we talked with Luke
from - tech tips about in one of our
recent videos you can go check out where
the the weight distribution is a bit
better so it shouldn't pull down quite
as much when you're wearing it I was a
big problem for me especially when using
it where
during testing if it dips just a little
bit you can really get a lot of screen
door or just blurriness because your
eyes don't line up perfectly if the
lines anymore so some of that should be
fixed now and in addition to that we
tried to talk to five engineers we had
two medians with HCC at CES
unfortunately no one there really seems
or no one we were able to speak to you
seem to have engineering knowledge so I
don't have much more for you on that but
that's the basics of the of the HTC news
there's also just quickly if you missed
it there's a rollup LG display this is
what you'd call a halo product it's just
kind of cool it's a an LG 77 inch
transparent OLED and you can roll OLED
TVs like like a tube like this mat you
just roll it up it's slated for launch
in two years we'll see if it happens
it's mostly a thing to get some noise
and interest in LG they were very strict
about meetings it was behind closed
doors only and you had to book a meeting
and not only that the meetings were
completely slammed as soon as they
announce the product so really not a not
a shocker there but we didn't get any
footage of it unfortunately it is kind
of interesting that as a technology I
don't know how applicable it is to any
of our users Asus had portable displays
at the show this is a bit more
interesting we've used these before some
of the older ACS portable displays you
can plug them in via USB and we've used
them with laptops or even the old like
ZOTAC portable pcs that uh that we
reviewed at ages ago they're kind of
cool because it gives you two screens if
you're using a laptop for video editing
at a show it's a very specific use case
but the Zen screen go is one of them it
has a four hour battery pack included
and a mounting stand it uses USB type-c
connects to laptops and Android phones
and it works over USB 3 as well and it's
got a 7800 milliamp hour battery they
also announced the pro art 4k this is
another portable display it's a 4k
display supposed to be more accurate
color 21 0.6 inches
OLED for the display
two USB type sees and HDR 10 and it
weighs 2.2 pounds about a kilogram
that's the peak u2 - you see which is
kind of interesting for anyone who works
a lot and travels then HTS also had some
laptops will close out with those so on
the topic of ACS company also announced
its new laptops including the rog SKT t1
hero the rog G 703 and the Zenbook 13
the SKT t1 laptop is a partnership with
eSports team SK Telecom t1 and basically
is a normal laptop that's co branded and
comes with accessories including a 120
Hertz IPS display a gtx 960 and an intel
i7 making for a combination targeted at
mobile gaming the g 703 is a 17.3 inch
laptop 1080p display 144 hertz g-sync
panel with an i7 78 20 HK and a factory
overclocked 4.3 gigahertz gz X 1080
that's $3,500 and then the Zenbook 13
and asu's x 507 or last these are more
consumer targeted laptops that both use
MX 110 graphics so not much else to say
about them and available first half of
2018 that pretty much wraps up most of
the rest of the CES stuff we saw the
show but didn't get to do a standalone
video on it there's plenty of other cool
stuff there kind of interesting cars
there there were interesting automotive
and automation technologies but not
really our our coverage priorities so as
always you can subscribe for more
information check out the last 28 or so
videos that we made on CES if you're
curious about any of that stuff and
we'll have some other round ups and back
to normal testing soon you go to
