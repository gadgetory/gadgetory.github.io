2015 we are here at PAX East now flying
across the country for that GGC still
has another two days for it but we're
focusing on pax east for this weekend
and the last thing we did at GDC was
valves virtual reality demo which is a
full room full-scale virtual reality
demonstration where you put on a
head-mounted display similar to the
oculus rift but a bit more advanced and
different in scope in that the room
actually has what's called lighthouse a
valve technology and lighthouse is a
pair of IR sensors that mount in the
corners of the room and these currently
use lasers to scan the room actively you
can think of this as a much more
simplistic form of what automated cars
use when they're scanning the road they
scan the room actively determine the
players location determine the players
proximity to the walls so that the
system can tell the player when they're
approaching that wall because you have
no perception of the outside environment
when you're in the virtual reality
headset valves VR demo has been in
development for a while now and it's a
bit different than oculus in that they
are using two wiimote like controllers
that you hold in each hand and they've
got the head mount display itself which
is developed by HTC called the vibe and
the vibe has several I our receivers on
the front of the head mounted display or
the hmd so this allows it to receive
signal from the lighthouse set up in the
corners of the room when you put the
head mounted display on it's just like
oculus in that you've got a somewhat
wide field of view wrapping around to
create presence in the game so this
provides the player more than the usual
90 degrees field of view presented by a
monitor which they to deplane and that
means that the visor sort of wraps
around your eyes like that and this
provides you a more immersive experience
and it looks more like you're in the
actual environment this also assists in
producing the three dimensional
appearance of the virtual reality setup
so in this demonstration we played a few
different types of games one of them was
a painting game where I was given the
two controllers and one of them
represented a palette for paint and you
rotate that left right to access
different tools like in Photoshop where
you have different brushes erasers and
colors the right one was the actual
paint gun and you sort of point that
around the environment and are able to
draw different objects and materials in
three-dimensional space to this end it
is more like sculpting than painting and
it's actually a little bit difficult to
get used to because everything
everything we've learned from using
computers tells us to draw as if on a
two-dimensional canvas unless you're a
3d modeler walking around the
environment was actually pretty easy it
wasn't too disorienting and it was very
quick for me to get used to your mileage
may vary at the end of the demonstration
when I took the headset off I had a sort
of interesting experience with distorted
vision so because of the way the visor
warps around your eyes to present the
wider field of view and the more
immersive experience and the appearance
of 3d my vision was sort of blurred
toward the edges where the visor was was
at its limits and this persisted when I
removed it and went back to the actual
real world and to this end the presenter
from valve almost looked like a
two-dimensional npc from a game it was
very strange it was sort of like your
brain is very clearly tricked into
thinking that it is in another
environment so you're existed in two
places at the same time and when you can
hear someone in the room talking to you
but you can't see them because you have
this headset on and you hear them moving
because they're trying to stay out of
your way as you move in
three-dimensional space it's actually
somewhat disorienting to get used to but
I do think that is something you would
get used to over time we were told after
a couple of hours of use most players
had a very firm grasp of their VR
technology so that is valves VR in a
very brief form if you want more
information on the headset how it works
and HTC's version of the technology with
my impressions using the technology you
can click the link the description below
for more information do follow the
channel 4 packs updates as we were here
all weekend and we will see you all next
time
