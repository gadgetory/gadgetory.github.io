access net and this video is a
discussion I had recently with chris
roberts from cloud Imperium games he is
perhaps best known for his work on star
citizen and this time we were talking
about technology so we talked about it
as it pertains to the greater games
industry and who star citizen
specifically and the technology up for
discussion primarily was DirectX 12 and
Vulcan the two new API is coming to
market that promise to brain developers
closer to the metal so to speak when
they're developing their games and that
should allow more draw calls and greater
graphics on lower end hardware so that
discussion is in this video we had two
parts for this video the second one
comes on Friday and that talks about
game engine architecture and game engine
design going into the future the next
generation of gaming so you'll find that
on Friday come back for that for this
video please check out the patreon link
if you like this type of content and
want to support us through in more of
these endeavors but that's all for my
interest so enjoy the interview with
Chris link in the description below for
the full article if you'd rather read a
compressed written version of this so I
don't know what what David sent over to
you but I was hoping we could revisit
some of the tech topics sure so DirectX
ya dx12 and Vulcan a bit if that's
something you know anything about but
the x12 first right so that's kind of
you know what our focus is but the
refactoring that we're doing at the low
end of the engine will work for that
because I mean they they have sort of
similar approaches and I sort of been
more about that kind of you know multi
multi core multi-threading you know
multi job paradigm which were where you
know doing a lot in the engine moving
towards so we know we're doing a fair
amount of it's not just adding more jobs
basically because it's also about
refactoring some of the pipeline and how
you deal with the data and how you sort
of organize your resources right so you
can be sort of more paralleling
which is kind of how you gather the real
power of dx12 a lot of people you can
just you could basically take the x11
sort of renderer and make it the x12
pretty quickly you know gonna get the
benefit of the x12 or or sort of the
Vulcan stuff until you've done some more
fundamental refactoring so that's kind
of what we're doing is we're we're
saying okay we're going to do it right
so we'll really get the performance
gains and so that's that's one of the
things actually that Frankfurt the
German office is leading on because
we've got quite a few the engineers
there that build the engine in the first
place and they've actually been involved
in the various you know dx9 of the x11
implementations of CryEngine there was
something interesting I was talking to
another editor about I don't know how
how difficult is it to integrate with
dx12 as a game developer the same way
you dealt with the x11 frame it's pretty
easy
mm-hm but you're not gonna get the full
power so the the issue is that most game
engines were not really written with A's
you know massively parallel kind of
architecture in mind and that's
fundamentally what you need to do to
really get the best benefit out of the
next generation of graphics API s which
is you know just that you can be feeding
lots of stuff at the same time to the
graphics card right and you're not but
only by just one thread or whatever so I
mean typically you know like the old
CryEngine has one thread for the
rendering one fret to the main game with
one fret for the physics you know and
that works fairly well like back in the
xbox 360 days and you know there's been
slight scaling of it for you know more
PC use so like the engines move more to
a job approach as opposed to a thread
approach so you know drum approaches you
just say his is a task BAM and you just
kick it off to the job manager of the
job manager manages hundreds of
thousands of these amongst all the
progress
train sounds available and that sort of
requires sort of thinking of your task
differently compartmentalizing it making
sure it's not dependent on other things
and other data and so there's been some
java fication CryEngine over the last
few years but we're sort of taking it
further because you know we know that
with where yo we're building for a PC
and we're building for high end PC so
now we have quite a few we have more
threads available with more power than
you would typically do even on a
next-generation console but part of that
is you know there's a big test is you
know the renderer in CryEngine pretty
much it was sort of build with the
conception of a 1-1 thread kind of thing
going on so it's a bunch of stuff that
gets put on the render pipeline you know
and then it then it gets printed out for
the sort of assumes it's all in the same
space area etc and so we need to
compartmentalize that better and do a
better management of the individual
resources so it's not sort of one
monolithic kind of render pipeline yeah
that's kind of what the the the
fundamental sort of big work that were
embarking up and I think that's
something that you know is kind of
pretty fundamental to an engine and
they're not noise constructed with that
in mind I mean even Yui for which is
obviously a bit newer than CryEngine hey
if you know originally the way
instructable structured was very much a
lot McCrea into paradigm I have pretty
much the same sort of delineation of of
threads now I haven't looked at the code
recently but that simply was quite a
while ago but but I think that
fundamentally you know there is some
definite work that has to happen on the
low-level
in all game engines to really push the X
well I mean it's you know it's easy to
sort of do the demo like that now you
saw squaring it to do with the final
panics and yeah but that's just pushing
raw and you know look at the rig it was
on I mean yeah look at the graphics part
in there I mean you could probably do
the same with the x11 that's just proof
force to really see the benefit of the
f12 it's going to be more about you do
that lower level refactoring and then
you'll be able to actually get some
pretty interesting for
even on some you know cops are quite
powerful pcs are quite powerful right so
for for star citizen I would imagine the
type of stuff you're trying to do would
pretty directly benefit from the newer
api's then with yes yeah I mean you know
like draw calls like everyone will tell
you in entrance and graphic stuff
drawable huh five everyone has because
it just gets bottled man can only push
so much through one high and you know
that's the thing that you get where say
add x12 Vulcan is that if you factor
your engine correctly you're not so
funnel neck by draw calls and you can
run you know you know 10x 100x draw
calls through at the same amount of time
right so you know that's obviously a big
one I mean for us we actually do we do
some stuff already we've we've got some
tech that we've worked on that kind of
also get around the draw call so we've
got a we've got some specific character
shaders that are using a very different
approach to like how you would texture
characters which is which is more a sort
of material a material sort of lock up I
guess would be the best way to say it so
you apply a shader we don't actually
bake textures onto the characters
anymore we we have a we we have our base
character and then we sort of doing a 3d
program kind of like the areas that
would be say material one material to
material three material for and then so
like if there was only four different
materials on that character there would
be one draw call because the whole
character would be there and then it's
an index lookup from material into a
much higher resolution PBR material and
you can like really have high really
Texel density and really scale so you
know you can get right up on it with the
camera and it's not gonna break down Wow
so that's kind of you know for us that's
sort of like some of the tech that we've
been doing for characters and smaller
props to allow us to have the fidelity
that you can get super up-close but also
sort of you know how in the world that
houses many assets in the scope that we
we have and and you know in this tech
also has various blending and dirt and
material levels and stuff like that
it's kind of the next generation
approach to probably character shading
and stuff I mean you're sort of seen
parts of it being done and say the order
1886 and also I think the e4 filtrated
that I use some of these techniques to
to make the infiltrator and everything
look quite as good but no one's taking
it quite as far as we're doing on the
character stuff because we take it all
the way through so I mean it still you
know we're still working on it and doing
some R&amp;amp;D but we sort of we we know we've
we've actively been looking at stuff
that also kind of defeat the draw call
issue in other methods rather than just
relying on a pirate ship DX well with
dx12 is have you already sort of
prioritized support do you know are you
already trying to build for it or is
this something out in the future process
it's part of one of the tasks of the
engine group right now so it's actually
something that we've it's commenced on
and we'll be working I'm just saying
that it's we're doing it I guess the
right way but just slapping you know
changing a couple of API calls and
saying we've got the x12 so it will it
won't won't be ready until sort of next
year sure but but yeah we're actively
working on it I mean it's part of you
know now we work pretty closely with a
and B and it's part of one other things
that is a big deal for them and would be
a big deal friend video - really but you
know we really want to try to utilize
more more of the power sort of today's
graphics cards now so it's that it's
also on the compute side where we're you
know when there's a whole bunch of stuff
that we're starting to layout to compute
to allow us to do some pretty cool stuff
like box holes and stuff like that so
we've got a whole bunch of other cool
stuff I mean there's a lot of stuff the
other thing is that we're focusing a lot
of our efforts and work so things that
like things for like things are fluid
Sims that we could use for gas clouds
more than you know the background sort
of compute
stuff to allow us to
sort of voxel ization of asteroids you
know and then there's also a whole bunch
of sort of GPU tessellation stuff that
we've actually planning for our sort of
planet mature we've kind of looking on
sedated stuff cut out there for a second
that you were planning for your country
so you know we may be able to deliver
some of the stuff it all you have an
adult you work on like the procedural
planet level so you know so we'll see
what happens to that promise
so we may actually you know do something
that I felt with the maybe stage two
with stage one or the persistent
universe which would be pretty awesome
yeah yeah that would be cool is a is
Vulcan of interest here at all is that
because you know from my standpoint we
we we would like to be the x12 as well
as you know OpenGL next or whatever you
want to call it often yeah because I
mean we want to support units so I mean
we have our servers run units for a
start so we actually this works and unix
as well as just you know straight
windows but the problem we have is that
you don't have a you know there is a
graphic driver yet there's an OpenGL
implementation that was just recently
released with CryEngine but it's
probably it's pretty early it's pretty
slow and then the other problems we've
done it's quite a lot of customization
already to the pipeline so the render
pipeline so a lot of the stuff like it's
it's not simply it's not a plug-and-play
basically right and so you know for us
we sort of have this debate about you
know you know supporting the always like
what do we you know if we didn't have
the if we only had the X well when we go
back and support the x11 mapping so I
think probably our tendency would be the
more focus on the next level of OpenGL
but that would be after the X well right
and then I of course dx11 is still fully
supported in star citizen you're not
just abandoning it at the export so
basically you need the X 11 or 12 we're
not no abandon it so we're gonna make
sure performs pretty well on the X 11
and with the X 12 is steps it up and
some of the refactoring is going to help
no matter what even for the X 11 because
just being better about organizing your
resources and data and java fiying it
even though you may still be bottlenecks
on the draw call issue and there's a
plenty of other stuff that can can be
paralyzed on the render and so so that
will benefit the X 11 as well well in
terms of the the star citizen stuff more
specifically outside of all the
technical things going on is there
anything you want to you know address
for fans or bring up or say we have a
couple of weeks when I share some stuff
that hopefully people will like I think
they will we're going to show some you
know on the tech stuff that you know is
hard to do with smart 42 and you know
the multi crew that we've demoed back in
games con is moving along quite nicely
so that's something we're pretty
confident of being able to share which
people use over probably towards the end
of October but it's it's it's looking
good and I think people will actually
have a lot of fun because it's not it's
a big level and it's not really it's not
an empty level there's lots of things to
do so it's like a bit of a playground
right I'm kind of looking forward to
people getting out there you know
getting in there you know ships whether
they're a multi cruise ship or a single
seater ship and you know flying around
and you know just kind of getting into
trouble with each other against each
other you know counting AI it's it's a
it's you know the very very very
beginning stages are kind of like what
the actual sort of distant universe in
space will feel like right so it's not
you know it's not a sort of limited
arena combat map it's not just gonna be
about small single sea fires dog
fighting
so I'm actually I'm pretty I'm pretty
interested to see you know the community
getting to that and the kind of cool
stuff that I'm sure are seeing videos
you're saying I'm looking forward to
getting the multi-crew of people's hands
because really it's going to have all
the core elements they'll have FPS it
will have sort of kind of the social PE
elements obviously it will have the
dogfighting flying around which is arena
commander and it's sort of like the
basic skeleton that focuses in Universal
behind although it's missing lots of
features and functionality you know
we'll be adding them as are as you know
every month as we go along it really
will be the first time that people will
get more of this sort of scope or scale
and the possibility of star citizen
detail the whole idea of being on foot
walking around space station getting
into ship powering it up flying off you
know coming across the derelict getting
EBA encruster back to investigate the
derelict have been back in your ship
flying to an abandoned Space Station
landing I am going and exploring and
finding some items or whatever and then
getting into gunfight with other players
all that sort of stuff is going to be
possible and available on there the
multi crew release which is with you
know our PU alpha right now it's 1.3 so
I wear I'm pretty excited to sort of see
how yeah people react and what kind of
things they all do with the videos help
they'll record because yeah it's it's
it's essentially going to show the
framework of wealth will be so cool
about stuff because it's that sort of
fidelity and being able to sort of
transition between those states is
something you don't get on any other
game so you know you have space games
where you can travel you know - you know
loads of different star systems and
trade between you and everything but you
don't have that sense of like visceral
like being inside a ship or being inside
environment or being running around a
detailed city or whatever and then you
know getting a ship and fly somewhere
else and visit some other place so I
think yeah just the early stage of that
will hopefully get people excited and
reminding them why why they that star
citizen and even though it's taking
longer than everyone would like it to
take that it's worth</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
