thought net and i'm joined by a patrick
stone
hey guys we're gonna talk about thermal
interface today or a thermal compound
mmm thermal paste so i guess the main
purpose of this content is to explore
why thermal paste is used to the
different types of thermal paste or
thermal interfaces and sort of dive into
what it actually does we all know that
it's siphons heat away from whatever
it's in contact with but to what extent
and why not just use copper I'll be good
right because then you could just have
metal on metal and it would make sense
like if you're cooking on a stove you
have the the burner and you put the
piece of metal on top and it heats up
right that's how it's supposed to work
excite this kind of heat transfer works
a little different different yeah yeah
so with what CPUs will take as the
standard example you have the CPU die
the actual silicon on top of a substrate
which is like green wait for chip
singing yeah yeah
maybe not really the best word right and
then on top of the die is the IHS did a
great heat spreader and that has sort of
a convex bowing to it very slight but
it's there and that has imperfections in
the surface mm-hmm so why don't you walk
us through the rest of the yeah so
what's happening the way that I often
explain it whenever someone is asking
about it is if you got like a sandwich
here you'd think that the IHS on the cpu
would be a nice perfectly flat contact
with the heat sink on top the bottom of
the heat saying the cold play yeah the
cold play exactly right and then so if
you got those two things on top of each
other stacked like that you'd think it'd
be perfect heat transfer but if we get
to it on the micro level like on the
microscopic level you can see in there
it doesn't look anything like a flat
surface on a flat surface so what we've
got to do is we've got to fix that
because we definitely do not want air
right as our medium for heat transfer
you were telling me it has some kind of
very low thermal
conductivity so the the way that thermal
conductivity is measured is in a unit
called watts per meter Kelvin mmm yep
and with copper you have about 400 watts
per meter Kelvin of thermal conductivity
believed at 25 Celsius with aluminum
it's half that it's about 200 watts per
meter Kelvin yep it's so pretty good
right and that's why in our copper
versus aluminum cold blade test you see
copper outperforming but just barely
it's actually very it's a very small
difference right unless you move to like
the x99 big CPUs right so with with
aluminum and copper you have 200 to 400
watts per meter Kelvin thermal
conductivity and then with thermal paste
like any of this stuff this is probably
four to seven mm-hmm watts per meter
Kelvin very small compared to metal yeah
but air is haribol haribol so yeah so
we're gonna try and do then is we want
to get rid of the possibility of having
air in between our heat sink and our
integrated heat spreader we want that to
be a perfectly conductive mechanism and
so in order to fill that gap we're just
gonna squeeze some throw phase in there
we're just gonna just ooze it on and
just like jam it in but like a tube of
toothpaste well no not exactly
so what we're gonna do that well I guess
there's different ways to apply it there
all right I don't think that they are
all correct I've seen you know the put
it on and use a credit card to smooth it
method I don't like doing it so
different ways to do it the way I
normally do it is sort of a grain of
rice sighs mm-hmm
blob of thermal paste right in the
center and then when you tighten the
actual CPU cooler onto the bracket you
want to do opposing corners yeah so that
it applies the the pressure to the
surface equally yup and distributes the
thermal compound on it I like that I
like that thought that's good train of
thought I actually usually go with one
of two things if I'm lazy and I just
want to get it on quick I'll go with
very similar to the grain of rice thing
the size of like a dinner pea like you
know like a green pea right and I'll
drop that right in the middle and again
when when you put that heatsink right on
top of the integrator
each spreader it's gonna it's gonna
force that stuff outward there's some
really cool videos on YouTube about that
and this actually shows like with a
glass plate on top of the grid looks
better right the other method that I
like a lot because it gets really good
coverage on the integrated heat spreader
is if you like kind of draw like an X on
to the integrated heat spreader and you
don't want to draw the X from corner to
corner you want that extra bit sort of
in the center because again when you
press down with the heatsink it's going
to spread that out as you make the
surfaces meet another thing that you
were telling me that that was really
really good to remember is that we don't
want a huge amount of thermal kind and
why was that well too much is worse than
none at all
hmm with this stuff and that's because
with with not at all what's happening is
you have tiny imperfections in the
surface of the IHS and of the copper
cold plate or aluminum cold plate those
imperfections are just a byproduct of
the machining process it's not something
that can really be avoided unless you're
doing you know space engineering level
of validation so that's unavoidable and
those imperfections are what introduces
the air pockets the air pockets get
really hot but it's worse to have an
entire surface covered with compound mmm
where you have zero copper to IHS
content yeah yeah so in that case if you
had to choose none or way too much
you're better off with none yeah yeah
and to go back to like having copper on
copper I remember back in shoot I guess
five or ten years ago now there was a it
was really popular to do what was called
laughing where you actually take them
and sand them down to get more of that
smooth to smooth but again the concepts
are all still the same you want as much
copper on copper as you can get and you
don't want air so you gotta have some
thermal compound so on this thermal
compound stuff what what would you say
is probably some of the best mixtures
out of the silicone is it's kind of like
the most basic it's kind of stuff you're
gonna see the liquid yeah and you're
gonna see it on like an expensive
electronics like in a router you might
have silicone in between the routers
central processor and it's heatsink but
those are
meant to produce tons of heat transfer
what's what's a better compound there's
there's like the nano diamond compound
so there's different types of compounds
some of it this this coolermaster stuff
is actually really bad
this comes with I think it came with an
AMD CLC or something like that right
this stuff will stick the cold plates of
a cpu and you all break pins getting at
all no G's which I've done so it does
impact it the we have some other stuff
here there's there's diamond compound
which is some of it is harder to spread
mm-hmm yeah that's true that's a good
point
and so that that can be an issue you can
heat it up in like a cup of water if you
really have to I've seen that done
before you just get a hot cup of water
put the tube in there yeah they can't
dry it off right fine it so if you can't
get it out of the tubes and that's
that's a way to do that but that's the
really hardcore stuff it's gonna have
the highest thermal conductivity mm-hmm
it's not necessarily worth spending 20
or 30 dollars on a tube of thermal paste
unless you're an extreme over the other
you can buy stuff like this stuff is all
six bucks
yeah maybe as much as like 12 or 15 to
12 yeah right but not ridiculously
expensive yeah so there's what else is
there other than diamonds there's a
silicon compound yeah silver base stuff
silver based yeah I remember
there was stuff called mx2 back on the
market several years ago and basically
it's got metal in it and the amounts of
metal are gonna help to conduct
electricity electricity excuse me heat
better so that's certainly something
there the other thing I was thinking
about is do do we need to be worried
about it breaking down over time oh
right yeah so thermal compound can sort
of crack as it dries and moves right
and there's also a curing process some
of the thermal paste good point will
perform much better as it ages you know
there's there's a tipping point where
that's no longer true but you know if
the Machine returns and all that but
eventually when you start with the
thermal compound you should actually see
worse performance earlier in the testing
then maybe a couple days down the line
yeah normally
and then as it ages has it heats up
it'll crack so then you have issues of
like with laptops where you're replacing
the thermal compound for GPUs and
laptops yeah that's because it just it
just incinerates an easy useless too hot
too often yeah and then I guess the
final topic is different types of
thermal interfaces yeah
so there's pastes well so like just
today we were looking at a motherboard
and we're looking at the VRM and around
the vrm instead of thermal paste making
contact with the transistors in the VRM
it was actually this sort of like a pad
material yeah and it's the same stuff
that I'd seen do in repairs on like a
PlayStation 3 or an Xbox 360 you there
give me pink they can be you know grey
they can be white but it's just a it's
almost a rubbery feeling foamy feeling
material and it does the same sort of
thing it's there for that that
conductive heat transfer it's just not
on the same level I say the this more
expensive thermal compound right and it
also one know where the item is that it
will conform to the surface better yeah
that's a really good point so if you
have like a choke that's more of a
square and you want to get some coverage
over the sides of it and you'll get that
from the pads and GPUs do the same thing
if you pull apart a GPU you'll find that
the heatsink the aluminum heatsink is
often applied somewhere near or on the
vrm and the vram module yeah to using
some sort of pad or film or adhesive
that isn't a paste
basically yeah so I think that about
covers the thermal interface stuff I
mean there are probably several other
smaller topics but those are the kind of
things that we wanted to talk about for
sure yeah so if you like this kind of
