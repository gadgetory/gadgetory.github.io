machine learning device okay all right
fixed it NZXT h 700 i is an example of
the opposite end of the embargo
discussion from last week people rush to
review the product without really
digging into it because there was no
embargo so we spent the last few days
really working on this one trying to get
the smart device to work and this case
is one where it's got a lot of really
positive features high build quality
excellent design and the spotlight is
stolen by an attempt at machine learning
buzzwords before that this video is
brought to you by thermal grizzly makers
of the conductor not liquid metal that
we recently used to drop 20 degrees off
of our coffee leak temperatures
thermal grizzly also makes traditional
thermal compounds we use on top of the
IHS like cryo not and hydro not pastes
learn more at the link below the age 700
eye is a culmination of a lot of really
good ideas and then one overreaching one
and an example of some of the good ideas
would be for example this back panel
which has a button eject so that you can
just push the button and it pops out and
now obviously you know you have your
hand there but it's actually really nice
because it makes it the easiest panel
I've worked with in terms of putting a
back panel on a case that has already
got cables in it and having it closed
very easily so major plus they're cool
mechanism on the release and overall
just an extra step of engineering that
we don't normally see and that's cool
another cool factor is the actual
ventilation which there's vents on every
side front left front right bottom
Center whole top left top right and
plenty of meshing on the back so this
ventilation pretty much aligns with what
we said we wanted in the s340 elite when
it was reviewed about a year ago when we
reviewed it and my criticism for the SD
40 leads was quote here's how we didn't
stantly improved the s3 40 elite
shortened the glass panel so that it
doesn't protrude beyond the power supply
shroud then stick the front steel panel
on to an underlying frame with mesh and
cut a grille into the side of the new
front panel this gives a one-inch depth
from the front panel to the end
terior and now we can actually use a
middle fan intake without being utterly
pointless and they've done that they
improved all the things is that I wanted
to see improved so well done txt none of
these things were particularly unique
ideas I certainly didn't come up with
them I just requested them and I'm sure
they heard similar requests from lots of
other people so it's cool to see that
they've done that this has full venting
up and down the side we did test with
the front panel removed and the case
does pretty well overall as you'll see
momentarily as for the other features
they've got a bit crazy with cable
management we currently have it all and
done and these at velcro ties come
pre-installed you route them under the
cables tie them back over the other side
and there's channels like up here
there's three channels four cables
channel four cables here there's a
channel for your SSD cables so
channeling four cables everywhere and
then on the inside of the case they've
got the infamous NZXT cable management
bar that we saw first on the estimate 40
and as returned so this is the cable
management part now this thing right
here it's got a bit of an artsy flair to
it comes down goes in I think comes back
out down here you can actually remove it
there's two screws one is here and then
the other one is in here and unscrew
both of those and you can push it
forward or back a bit I would like to
see this bar come down about an inch to
better accommodate the 80 X 24 pin cable
because right now we're kind of bending
the cable in a way that doesn't look the
greatest and in a case that has so much
emphasis on cable management it's just a
small feature that an extra half-inch
would have gone a long way because not
every motherboard has the ATX 24 pin in
the same spot and I was clearly doesn't
have it in the same spot as what it was
designed for so that would be nice to
see but still overall good features on
cable management the front of the case
in terms of cooling it's got three fans
in the front there NZXT fans one in the
back and the three in the front or 120s
and those do pretty well because they
have actual access to air
everywhere except the front center and
keep our temperatures reasonable it's in
the top 25% of cases we've tested for
CPU thermals which you'll see later now
this is where I would normally focus a
lot more on all the rest of the build
features in here like sort of mounting
bracket for radiators and fans on the
top unfortunately that's gonna be cut
short so we can focus on the smart
device which is a new thing and exe has
added so what does a smart device do in
your computer case well it does machine
learning what the hell does that mean
basically you take it and first you
retrieve it from the garbage and then
once you've retrieved it from the
garbage you can install it actually
comes installed I guess but you've
probably thrown it out at this point so
I'm just assuming you've done that and
you need to install it again
so you install it in the case it's got a
couple different channels for fans and
basically what it comes down to is a an
attempt at trying to listen to your
system noise levels from inside the case
while plotting temperature against fan
RPMs and then it attempts to generate a
fan rpm to temperature to noise response
curve and Antioch C's marketing
materials create this mind-blowing
graphic for it by which I mean my mind
cannot comprehend what the graph is
trying to convey and it basically says
it's a 3d curve for your fans so they've
got 3d and they've got machine learning
both of which are great buzzwords what
happens in reality is you plug all the
fans and you open NZXT cam which is it's
a whole different story you hope the
xdcam and once you've got that open go
to the smart device page you must be
connected to internet you have to log
into an account and once you've done
those things you log into the account
you can start the calibration process
that starts with well it's got three
stages and I'm gonna explain this to you
because the software does a terrible job
of it so stage number one is preset in
the preset stage it tests for system
idle and it tests for system load the
is where you play a game or run some
application like fire strike and once a
test those it basically is checking the
temperature levels with the current
preset configuration the next stage is
when it does calibration so this is the
one where basically you complete the
previous stage by playing a game and a
test your levels while playing a game it
does not tell you that Stage one has
completed it does not tell you to stop
playing a game it doesn't tell you what
to do next so you just keep playing your
game because you who plays a game for
twenty minutes so what happens next is
it all freezes doesn't make any progress
until you close your game which it
hasn't told you to do once you close
your game it will then place your CPU
under approximately 80 percent load the
NZXT cam software has its own load
stress tester built into it and this is
an attempt to stress the CPU with their
built-in stressor modulate the fan rpm
check the temperature levels and then
readjust as necessary and develop a
curve there are a lot of challenges with
this one of them is the fact that
temperature doesn't change instantly
with the change of a fan speed
especially if it's liquid coolant
fortunately ours is not but if you have
a liquid cooler the liquid takes longer
to soak that change than anything else
in the system so that's a challenge
another one is that it just gets stuck
and here's why it gets stuck from NZXT
the software only measures idle levels
when the cv is under 0 to 10 percent
load here's a problem with that cam puts
the CPU under six to eight percent load
you all start running Windows so you've
got six to eight percent load from the
software that needs you to be under ten
for idle monitoring then you have
Windows that's probably using that least
three to six percent on its own so
you're already gonna have frozen update
intervals on idle testing because of
that the next thing for what they
consider load levels it's got to be 35
to 65 percent load and stress levels it
has to be 90 percent above so the
software looks at your system
temperature
noise performance for stress 35 to 65
percent load and 4 or 90 above rather
and for load levels moderate which are
35 to 65 what you'll notice is that
between 65% and 90% nothing happens it
does not work it sits there stuck at 52%
or whatever it is for hours until you
step in it interfere so the problem is
NZXT is cam cpu stressor was generating
on our 6700 K test CPU 80% load you'll
notice if you are a mathematician that
the number 80 is not between is not
between 35 and 65 and is not above 90 it
is in fact between 65 and 90 so the
software doesn't progress it sits there
so to overcome this we just loaded prime
and burned it out a hundred percent and
made the same finish this whole process
of trying to machine learn the
temperature the noise and the RPM
response took over two attempts about
three to four hours to complete because
the cpu load restrictions are so
constrained that it would get frozen and
I would have to walk into the room and
manually open or closed applications to
get a trip to progress further it's
supposed to take about an hour to do all
of it and then it's supposed to read
from the cloud to get user data for
similar hardware components that you
have and apply that curve automatically
we have the case before most of the
public does which means that there's not
a lot of cloud data out there so it
probably takes a bit longer than if you
buy it in a week from now kam
occasionally throws prompts that are
completely uninformed for example this
one that said that the CPU is at 85
degrees which is 100% perfectly
acceptable as a temperature for this CPU
I don't know if it says this for just
every CPU as a blanket but for this one
it's certainly incorrect you're fine at
85 C and cam just seems like it has
overly sensitive semi arbitrary numbers
that it sometimes warns you about and
the sad thing with this one is that it's
contributing to misinformation where
people
genuinely think that an 80 degree
temperature for a CPU is a bad thing
obviously depends on the processor but
for something like these zseries LGA
1150 X CPUs is perfectly fine don't
listen to cab and please don't repeat it
because it's wrong so that's pretty much
how the smart device works like I said
it sort of woefully and tragically the
tracks from all of the amazing things
about the case you're buying a case if
you go to new egg and you look up eight
seven hundred I it will be listed under
computer cases it will not be listed
under machine learning and fat
controllers so you're buying a case
which means we should probably criticize
the case well it's not a lot to
criticize performance pretty well
thermally acoustically is acoustically
it's kind of so-so but thermally it's
pretty good
the design features a great kill
management good is good the I don't
everything I really have no major
complaints about the case construction
quality is sturdy the steel paneling is
relatively thick compared to a lot of
the market it's got cool features like
the quick release so I like the case
they've inset the glass it's not like
protruding from the side of the case it
has this bevel around there chamfered
edges it's good but it's $200 and it's
$200 because it has a smart device in it
and it's got the RGB LEDs which if you
like the hue it's included so great what
I'd like to see is the case with no
smart device I want an h2 700d to steal
a quote from one of our patreon backers
for dumb so eight seven hundred dumb
would be great if they can sell it at
anywhere from 120 to 150 dollars no
smart device maybe even know RGB LEDs I
mean you sell the hue anyway you sell it
as an add-on and then be the most
competitive case at the price on the
market that would be pretty cool
instead NZXT is trying so hard to get
the smart device out there because they
think it's really cool and kudos to them
it is pretty unique and interesting and
different so I totally understand why
they want to sell it exclusively with it
but it's nuking the potential of the
case because it could be a lot cheaper
appeal to a much wider base and would be
absurdly competitive with the rest of
the market just from the case alone
it does fine on its own merit it doesn't
need a computer inside of it to add cost
and make you really frustrated with it
because the case should not do more
things than house a computer and cool it
and now I refuse to agree that the smart
machine learning fan controller is part
of the cool it aspect that's sort of an
accessory to cool in it you put the fans
in there already let them do their job
if users want to quiet the fans they can
but they do just fine as is they don't
really need quieting the GPU probably
governs its own fan curve better than a
smart device does anyway I don't trust
an auxilliary device to control a GPU
fan speed unless it's a garbage GPU in
which case shame on me for buying it
also kam isn't finished it has
placeholder text everywhere ok so that's
enough about the smart device thing
short long story short we don't like it
and cam needs work let's go over the
good things quickly one more time before
we get into the thermals because the
smart device sadly the negatives are
overwhelming the rest of the case and
you're still buying a case at the end of
the day so it's fair to go over those
again from Patrick's written review
notes Patrick says has always NZXT has
taken particular care with cable
management there are cable channels all
over the back the tray which are
sections of removable plastic track with
integrated velcro ties they work well to
hold the profusion of front IO and smart
device cables that are included with the
case and they continue to work well once
the PSU cables are routed through them
the one downside is that since the
velcro loops are screwed into the case
it's better to thread cable through them
rather than plugging everything in and
wrapping up the straps later there's
also a small chunk of plastic innocently
labeled designated cable router looks
suspiciously like an NZXT puck but
fortunately for us it's removable you
can actually route stuff around it
though if you wanted to the cable
management bar is just as good as an
idea as it was when we first saw it in
the s 340 and H seven hundred eyes
iteration is a little bit more artistic
so not a bad thing there the bar sticks
closely to the shroud and the interior
of the case except where your angles
outward to allow for room for the smart
device and the s3 40s Bar outwards to
allow room for the ATX power
we're the age 700 I has about two
centimeters of clearance so we had to
route the power cable a bit more upwards
than we'd like but not a major issue at
all and still a nice-looking kala bar
and that little puck on the backside the
plastic cable routing one is one of the
examples of the extreme attention to
detail that ndx skis designers put into
this case I really can't speak enough to
the attention to detail its you see it
everywhere the panels the way they mount
is very secure but also as you saw easy
to just pop out they've got the mushroom
clips that are easy to work with not
gonna fall off like other cases on the
market then the front panel has these
air channels that are chamfered into it
so you take the front panel off and it
sort of bows outwards towards the user
but the actual front the exterior is
flat so that's just sort of chamfering
the inside and that's the fans breathe a
bit better
the attention to detail also shows on
things like these dots they are
functional and ventilation but they also
persist across the case dots here dots
here thoughts on the power supply shroud
which don't really help thermals as we
tested but it's nice to have for the
hard drives if you had one in there it
would benefit from that and that
attention to detail and things like the
cable management hole in the top so
there's no rubber grommets which that's
fine they're kind of dumb anyway and the
top has a bar that's straight across so
it'll accommodate every motherboard
because case is now need to keep in mind
that boards like Sky X and T r4 are
going to have PCIe or a bps 12-volt
headers all over the board and that
means that you've got to have cable pass
there's more places so they just cut a
bar straight across all that is great
but yeah let's get into the thermals as
always you can find our full testing
methodology linked in the article in the
description below along with Patrick's
written review starting our testing only
with the H 700 ICB torture benchmarks
the stock case operates at a 54 degree
Celsius delta T over ambient temperature
removing the front panel entirely only
reduced temperatures by six point three
degrees Celsius this shows that for
Ellis
to what the fans are capable of and DXE
is relatively close to its maximum
potential with its current panel and fan
inclusion and design the only way to
significantly improve would be mesh
clearly but that still only give me room
for up to six degrees Celsius
improvement with the current fan
configuration the side intakes are wide
enough to breathe and the interior of
the front panel is bezels in a way that
gives them some additional room to
circulate the air for perspective our
mesh mod of the H 500 P allowed us to
drop 6 to 8 degrees Celsius off the
stock temperatures so nth C's case is
right in line with that fixed variant
comparatively tortured test the results
position the stock h7 dry toward the top
quarter of cases functionally equivalent
to the thermal take abuse anyone see him
700 PE and core P 3 cases we're at about
54 degrees Celsius over ambient with the
H 700 I about 6 to 7 degrees warmer let
me silverstone our l06 chart champion
and adding to AF 14 fans to the mesh of
5 puts it atop the charge just for
reference again their additions not
stock as shown in the previous charge
NZXT has done well to get close to its
maximum cooling potential when
eliminating the front panel a far cry
from the 10 to 12 degrees Celsius gap of
the panelists versus stock paneled h 500
P aged 500 PE op rates a 56 point one
degrees Celsius EP low temperature here
over ambience but drops to become the
coolest case on the bench when its front
panel is removed down to 43 to 44
degrees Celsius that's the difference of
good versus bad panel design NZXT is
aged 700 i although not claiming to be a
high airflow case like the aged 500 p
those managed to leverage most of its
front fan cooling potential with the
boat out interior of the front panel on
the wide intake machine for GPU thermals
we start with torture thermals only with
the H 700 I the case exhibited a 5 to 6
degree reduction from removing the front
panel and taping over the power supply
showers ventilation did not create any
meaningful change of performance so
doesn't do a lot for our card maybe for
for example a PCIe device mounted in the
very last PCIe slot like an SSD that
would benefit from the holes in the
power supply shroud
temperatures are also comparatively good
to average depending if 700 is
positioned at about 52 point 5 degrees
Celsius delta T for the GPU temperature
positioning it between the Shogun and s
340 elite we already know that the
venting of the PSU shroud isn't directly
beneficial to our GPU thermals with this
card but it could help with other
devices and will certainly aid in
harddrive cooling and overall air flow
throughout the case no need to fully
compartmentalize the PSU and its cables
anyway 3d mark has the H 700 I toward
the top of our newer benchmark as
positions it in second for our new 3d
mark test blender provides a real-world
rendering test for blender rendering on
the CPU our CPU temperatures land at
thirty seven point six degrees Celsius
for the H seven hundred i ranking it
forth with the p3 and view sony one
functionally equivalent in performance
our l06 remains in the first as it has
for the past several months now GPU
rendering has the h 709 second behind
only the redline zero six and shows
everything operating it well within
acceptable conditions finally total
system noise is expectedly uninteresting
with the h seven hundred i toward the
worst end of the chart the case is
really not that bad the worst of these
cases is in the 40s and that's not
exceptionally loud the case roughly
matches the GN metro v version of the h
500 p marked at forty point two DBA for
total system noise on the ntsc case this
is the result of sticking four fans into
the case and opening up air flow a bit
and of course one thing not really
discussed or shown here is that by
opening up the air flow you can run
slower fans which counters the noise
concern so because the case didn't
actually breathe we ran these at max
RPMs for the the front and the rear fan
we put the GPU at fifty-five because
that's where the curve would put it a
cpu is added like eleven hundred rpm you
could lower those rpms with a similar
configuration and be fine
and that's because the case can breathe
reasonably you drop a couple hundred rpm
off the front and your noise levels are
now down another one to three decibels
depend what you did and what you use
overall the case performs reasonably
it's not the best case on the charts but
it's not that bad it's sort of like the
s 340 elite was where the 340 elite was
not impressive we didn't
like it a whole lot from an airflow
standpoint they slapped a panel on it
for glass this one puts the glass panel
on which with a much more meaningful and
obviously deliberate brushstroke and
there's a ventilation for the middle fan
to breathe so it'll do something and if
you put a radiator in the front it's not
going to be I mean obviously a radiator
is kind of a great equalizer for
everything but you still don't want them
running and efficiently and this kind of
resolves a lot of that so from that
perspective noise thermals it's fine
it's not exciting but it's fine and it's
good enough for NZXT that we mark it as
an improvement over the last design and
that's a good thing as for the rest of
it case designs great it is one of the
most thought out cases on the market
we've worked with lately it's woefully
is it's tragic that the inclusion of
these all these smart devices like feel
like it should come with a smart
doorbell and a smart refrigerator
because they're just so unnecessary to
have and it drives the price up to $200
if n dn/dt if you're listening please
please seriously consider this consider
removing at least one or both of the two
smarter devices that the fan control
thing and RGB LEDs consider removing
them so now the case for a little bit
above where the s340 is that's 240 elite
maybe maybe like 120 250 dollars it
would be so crazy competitive at that
price point at that price point your
competition is the Coolermaster H 500 P
it's no brainer you you win like do it
please the smart device you'll notice
those are you watching we did not have
thermal or noise results for it and the
thermal noise chart that's because it
sucks to work with it doesn't quite work
kam is buggy enough that like you can
get it to work probably theoretically
but after fighting with it for like six
hours on and off
I basically bagged it because while
sitting there
and basically what you need to know to
get it to work is sit there and watch
the CPU utilization if it's doing an
idle test and CPU utilization goes to
11% because cam eats so much on its own
intermittently then you need to kill
processes to allow it to complete that
portion of the test then the load starts
if the load starts and you're between 65
and 90 you need to fire up another
application to get it to 90 or down to
65 so it can complete once you've
completed it should work but I only have
so much time to put into something
before my expectation of it working
exceeds the desire to force it to work
and as a consumer if I were in that
situation I'd say you know what screw
this I'm either sending it back or I'm
plugging my fans into the motherboard
doing it manually and I'll be done in
less than 30 minutes
that's what it comes down to if the
smart device takes longer to configure
than doing it manually and it probably
does a worse job because let's face it
humans are going to be better at that
type of thing just because they know
what they want then it's not worth using
so that's my opinion on that but the
rest of the case is fantastic I wish it
were not toner dollars we'll see if they
listen and do a cheaper version but
that's it for this time patreon.com
