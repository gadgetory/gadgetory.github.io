hardcore overclocking here and today
we're gonna be taking a look at the V
RMS on the EVGA X 299 dark motherboard
and I did specify V RMS because there's
so much to talk about on this board that
if I actually wanted to cover everything
that's on the PCB this video would be 40
minutes long and nobody would want to
watch it so let's get to the V RMS
starting with the largest and most
important one the VCC in and or V core
if you're running KB like exits week or
if you're running sky like X its VCC in
before that this video is brought to you
by thermal grizzly makers of the
conductor not liquid metal that we
recently used to drop 20 degrees off of
our coffee leak temperatures thermal
grizzly also makes traditional thermal
compounds we use on top of the IHS like
cryo not and hydro not pastes learn more
at the link below so the reason why you
have this distinction is that skylight
Dex has a fiber and KB like X being
pretty much just KB like glued onto a X
$2.99 package doesn't have a fully
internal fire is the fully integrated
voltage regulator this thing exists is
basically a very low voltage low voltage
DC to DC converter it's present on the
CPU and Intel uses it because well let's
say you have a 200 watt CPU well ok no
welcher 200 watt CPU and there's kind of
two ways you could try deliver that
power right you could deliver it as 2
volts and a hundred amps or you could
developer it as 1 volt 200 amps both of
them are still 200 watts now this one is
really really hard on a vrm and the
reason for that is is because power
dissipation well there's more to VR and
power dissipation than just this but
very basically a good chunk of your V
RMS power dissipation is conduction
losses and those are expressed as
power equals I squared R so your vrm
resistance is kind of fixed well
somewhat fixed you can get it down but
the the amount of effort required to
make this lower is kind of ridiculous
past a certain point and takes up a lot
of physical space now you have this
current component which that grows
quadratically so it's much much so in
you know with the fiber you can very
easily massively drop the heat output of
the vrm by just going from you know
VRML putting one volt at 200 amps to the
R I'm outputting two volts at a hundred
amps and then the VAR I'm doing the the
fully integrated voltage regulator doing
that last step of the conversion of
going from 2 volts 100 amps to 2 volts
to from 2 volts 100 amps to 1 volt 200
amps so that final conversion happens on
the CPU itself and your vrm has to just
do 12 volts down to 2 volts instead of
down to 1 volt and stupid high current
which would produce a lot of heat so
that's why you have VCC n instead of
just straight V core because the actual
V core is generated on die with skylight
Dec CPUs as well as some other voltages
those system agent and io are both
external so let's talk about the VCC
nbrm we have here it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 11 12 phase and that means it uses a
doubling scheme because nobody
manufacturers a 12 phase voltage
controller the voltage controller here
is a is al 69 1 3 8 this is a inter sale
part and Inter sale are owned by Rene
sauce so that's just a little side note
it supports up to seven phases at one
megahertz switching frequency this is a
seven phase it's kind of special because
it'll support any phase configuration
that's X plus y less than 7 so it could
run like here it's running a six plus
one phase with that plus one being this
phase right over here but you could also
run it as a four plus
or a you know say a five plus one or a
two plus one if you felt like wasting
money because that is an expensive part
so that's the that's the voltage
controller running the operation and is
running six phases here now the PWM
signal from that goes into these chips
right here these are the actual doublers
and these are also inter-cell parts is
l66 one sevens these are some of the
smartest doubler chips you can get they
support some amount of current balancing
so they won't just let you know like the
most basic doublers essentially just
pass a pwm signal between one phase and
the other these things will actually
allow you to do things like turn off
half turn off the extra phases if
they're not being used balance current
if one phase is pushing significantly
more current than the other then it'll
actually skip a cycle or extend or
shorten a PWM signal for the phase
that's that's doing less or more work to
get it back into current balance so very
very smart doubler this is about as
close as you're gonna get to having a
real 12 phase vrm as is possible there's
not really any other like there are
competing parts that can do the same
amount of work but there's no anything
better than this out there so yeah this
this is as good as 12 phase as you're
gonna get and the actual power stage
used is also absolutely top-of-the-line
inter-cell componentry this is an ISL 99
22 set 22 7 B these things are five
point five dollars apiece for and that's
when you're buying them bulk okay so
these are some ridiculously expensive
MOSFETs and that's buying them bulk from
like a normal part supplier like Mouser
or digi-key I'm not sure if EVGA
actually gets like a even better bulk
discount on these but if you're buying a
real of these from Mouser yeah you're
paying five point five dollars a piece
these are really really expense
of power stages some competing parts
like an international rectifier 3555 is
about three dollars so these aren't
cheap and there's a reason for that
these aren't just regular power stages
these are smart power stages and they
come with a special casing so first
let's go over the reason why these are
considered smart they integrate current
monitoring and temperature monitoring
directly into the package so there's a
thermal sensor and a current sensor
built into these power stages so they
also integrate protections like
overcurrent protection and over
temperature protection now over
temperature protection on these is it's
very soft it basically just tells the
voltage controller hey you might want to
shut down the VRM we're over a hundred
and forty degrees centigrade internally
we're probably gonna die if we keep
running any longer but that is
ultimately like the EVGA can ops to
literally just disable that protection
from the side of the voltage controller
now the OCP on these is set at ninety
amps and that is hard if if any of these
phases exceeds 90 amps output it's gonna
shut down that phase and raise a flag
for the voltage controller that hey you
might want to shut down the rest of the
vrm because basically if one of those
phases hits 90 amps then probably most
of them are not far from that from
hitting that amount of current either
and shortly after one of these shutting
down the current load would end up
probably like it would push the current
load onto the remaining phases which
would probably push the rest of them out
of well over OCP trip points as well and
then the whole vrm would shut down
luckily you should never actually run
into that scenario because this is a 12
phase and if you're pushing 90 amps per
phase then that's like a hundred and
eighty amps
that's a thousand and eighty amps total
which the yeah the skylake X is
power-hungry but it's not two kilowatts
power-hungry cuz you're VCC and will
probably be between like one point eight
and two point something volts two point
six is considered maximum voltage for
ln2 for air
and water cooling you don't want to go
over two point two volts my experience
it doesn't actually like it seemed for
at least the CPU I've been dealing with
seems to prefer a lower VCC n rather
than a really really high one but I'm
still in that like I'm still pretty
close to two volts so yeah you don't
have to worry about the OCP on these it
is there in case of some kind of
catastrophic failure but you should
never ever really hit it now the other
cool feature of these is that they have
this exposed metal contact and that is
actually hooked directly into the
silicon die inside of these MOSFETs and
it massively improves a thermal
resistance of the packaging so the
internals of these run a lot lot cooler
because they're transferring heat
through a bit of metal rather than
ceramic or resin depending on the kind
of MOSFET packaging you're dealing with
some will use ceramic packaging some
will use resin so here you actually get
proper metal thermal transfer to the
heatsink VR I mean the you know the very
significant vrm eats sink that EVGA puts
on this board so those are all very nice
features that these have and in terms of
actual current capabilities these are
rated for a continuous output of 60 amps
assuming you can handle the heat output
60 amps 1.8 volts on one of these
produces 12 watts of heat so you're not
gonna be pushing 60 amps through you
know like if you end up in a situation
where every single one of these is
pushing 60 amps that vrm is gonna be
producing a ridiculous amount of heat
however you should not run into that
scenario because for reasonable power
outputs say for air-cooled overclocking
on sky like X you're gonna be looking at
like 200 to 300 watt power output on the
VRM and I'm doing all of the ratings
again with that 1.8 volts output of the
VRM and 500 kilohertz switching
frequency because well the vrm can't
actually go over that because you have
that one megahertz running through
doublers which will cut down the
frequency in half even if these are
really really smart they won't double
the they can't produce more frequency
out of thin air well they can't maintain
frequency while maintaining phase
interleaving
and phase interleaving is the most
efficient way to run of erm anyway so
it's not like they're gonna just pass
straight in one megahertz pwm into the
VR on the other thing is you don't
actually get control over the switching
frequency so it's whatever EVGA decides
to program and throwing the erm
efficiency out the window for marginal
improvements in a voltage regulation
it's probably not something they opted
for so 1.8 volts 500 kilohertz
air-cooled you're gonna be looking at
200 to 300 watts CPU power consumption
and AVR em heat output between 12 and 16
watts so really not that bad and the
ridiculous heat sinks that EVGA puts on
this board is gonna handle that no
problem now on water cooling things
start to heat up you can probably push
between 300 and 500 Watts depending on
the workload overclock and voltages at
which point you're looking at 16 to 30
watts of heat and now the you know now
that vrm heat sink that EVGA puts on
this board starts actually being useful
still massive overkill because there are
other boards that can sustain this kind
of power level admittedly they use the
same vrm and a slightly less cooling
oriented heatsink but there are boards
that can sustain this just this thing
has the best we are I'm cooling on a
modern motherboard for a while now so
it'll handle this kind of power output
no problem now if we go on liquid
nitrogen things go absolutely insane
we're talking power draw levels from 500
watts into the thousand watt range hot
very very hot and that's what that's
gonna be
and the end result is that you're gonna
be looking at VR on thermal outputs of
32 96 watts and well that's like a GPU
like that's the low-end GPUs worth the
worth of heat output or a reasonably
high-end CPU worth of heat output the
good news is for the motherboard that
most you know
liquid nitrogen workloads that would
pull a thousand watts won't last more
than a couple minutes the other thing to
consider is that when the CPU socket is
at a minus hundred same yeah minus 100
degrees skylake X has a pretty high cold
boot bug due to the voltage or a
fully-integrated voltage regulator it
doesn't work below minus 100 degrees in
most cases there's some CPUs that go a
bit lower some that go a bit higher but
in most cases around minus 100 degrees
and below that you're not gonna be able
to put like the the system's not gonna
even run so for that you know with the
socket at minus 100 minus 100 degrees
centigrade
the surrounding area of the CPU socket
tends to end up very cold as well so
what you'll find if you're doing any
liquid nitrogen overclocking this entire
area of the motherboard which actually
with this being a to dim kind of this
area of the motherboard tends to all end
up below ambient with anything really
close to the CPU socket actually just
being sub-zero so something like this
memory stick I would not be surprised if
that ended up at minus 5 degrees
centigrade and actually just building up
straight ice as it's not that rare for
the memory slots to literally freeze
over on really long overclocking
sessions so the vrm will actually end up
it won't be like like if you're normally
running your system your vrm will be
slightly above ambient temperature if
you're on liquid nitrogen your vrm will
start at a temperature significantly
lower than ambient because it's
literally the closest thing to the CPU
socket and it also is hooked very
heavily into the ground plane and the
collar and the power plane which are
both massive copper layers that will you
know transfer the cold from the CPU
socket to the vrm very very quickly
the flipside to this is is that the vrm
area tends to end up being a puddle as
you know you go idle and the vrm ends up
at -5 degrees and then you go full load
and the vrm ends up at like plus 50 or
plus 70 by the time you finish the
benchmark and all of that ice that built
up when it was idling is now water which
kind of sucks
so yeah which is why insulating on
liquid nitrogen
especially for sky like X is like really
really important now a few people might
be worried about that power draw figure
versus the eight pins the good news is a
eight pin on 18 gauge wiring you can
handle 480 watts because these are for
12 volts and for ground connections
they're not like GPU 8 pins which are 3
to 12 volts and 3 grounds so these
actually all the pins in these actually
transmit power and each pin pair is good
for 10 amps if you have 18 gauge wiring
if you're on 16 gauge wiring you can
push 624 watts per connector just fine
so you don't actually have to work like
you don't have to worry about these
melting but cables might get pretty warm
if you are you know again running
extended loads that's the other thing it
takes time for things to get halt so
just because you're pushing a thousand
watts doesn't mean these connectors are
gonna have it like are gonna be at that
really high stress level for long enough
to cause you know to start getting
really really hot and to the point that
it's concerning so that's the V core of
erm let's go cover I mean VCC n slash
recurve erm let's go cover some of the
others the VCCS AV RM right over here
also controlled by the is l69 one three
eight it's that plus one part of that
six plus one and this is well it's a
regular old power stage
it's an is L part again and this is a
ninety nine 140 and it's rated for 40
amps continuous output 15 amps 500
kilohertz switching frequency you're
gonna be looking at about two outs of
heat so you know no big deal there now
if you look so you know VCC sa is plenty
overkill because this is kind of what
you'd be looking at in terms of current
draw there now the VCC I OVR M is
located down over here this thing does
not actually have a heatsink this now
the VC CSA shares its heatsink with the
VCC and vrm so basically the temperature
of this thing is in
tirely bound to what the you know the
core power consumption because that's
what's really gonna change the
temperature of that vrm heatsink now
this thing doesn't actually have a
heatsink which is why it ends up with a
stronger power stage even though it
doesn't have to deliver as much like it
doesn't deliver more power than the VCCS
a does the voltage controller used here
is actually not inter-cell this is an
international rectifier 35 to 0 for this
is a four phase part it runs three plus
one phases and any configuration up to
that it's not flexible like the like the
69 138 which incidentally looks 69 138 i
forgot to mention this can run seven
plus is zero but yeah anyway back to the
35 to zero for this thing runs three
plus one and it's controlling this chip
right here which that's a international
rectifier 35 50 56 that's a 50 amp power
stage and for VCC which i should have
labeled that VCC I oh you're gonna be
looking at about again 1.2 volts you
know around 15 amps and this will
produce about 1.3 watts of heat because
again this is a 50 amp part not a 40 amp
part so yeah and this has no heat sink
so it needs to be a bit more efficient
than the one sharing it you know getting
to share with the vcore vrm now then
moving on to the even more minor V RMS
the memory which is this right here is
the actual phase and the controller is
all the way over here now these are
inter cell parts again and this doesn't
make a lot of sense to me this as you
can probably guess by the way based on
what it looks like yeah that that's one
of that's an is l99 22 7v I have no idea
why EVGA decided to put these on memory
power it makes zero sense to me it just
like because here's the thing like you
could make the argument Oh Bill of
Materials they're already buying a bunch
of these yes but they're evidently
buying a bunch of these as well because
these are doing VCC i/o all right if
they used only these everywhere
I'd guess it but
they have the 35:56 that's a 50-amp
party this thing is a lot lot cheaper
they have the 35 2204 which the voltage
controller isn't a 69 138 this is a this
is the 69 1 3 eights little brother this
is the 69 1 3 3 which is again X plus X
plus y less than 4 this time so that's a
four phase capable voltage controller
and it comes with the where is it in my
notes same switching frequency
limitation as the as the 69 138 but yeah
that so you know they downgraded the
voltage controller but ultimately
they're already buying 35 to 0 fours and
they're already buying 35:56 A's so I
really don't know why they decided to
put the 60 amp power stage on to memory
power like this is such a ridiculous
overkill and it's a single phase as well
which compared to say the like the core
like the main competitors for this
motherboard are the rampage 6 apex and
the asrock OC formula and both of those
used to phase memory power whereas this
uses single phase the asrock has a more
powerful memory vrm but like it doesn't
matter like it literally doesn't matter
ddr4 is like like 2 to 4 watts a stick
maybe really it's around 2 watts most of
the time and when you really hammer the
voltage you might get to 4 volt to 4
watts if you're on like a dual ranks
take with you no chips on like 16 chip
memory stick which would be dual rank
and really crank up the volts you might
hit that high power consumption figure
but again it's just like it's nothing
compared to any of the other things and
then you get this ridiculous power stage
here and I have no idea why it just
makes zero sense to me then again asrock
did basically the same thing on their OC
formula or they have a two-phase with
like 40 amp power blocks and it makes
just as little sense to me as why the
vrm is so powerful now ROG
you know asus rog decided that yeah
we're doing into phase but we're doing
it with like really like MOSFETs that
are like what would you say I had to
quit for the job
yeah that's one way to put it there
they're much much weaker MOSFETs than
what a ga or as ROC opted for and they
use they did a two-phase design so this
is not as powerful as the OC formula
it's stronger than what Asus has but
it's still ridiculous like even the Asus
one is just overkill like if this is
ddr4 it doesn't pull any bloody power
and you do get one memory phase for each
set of DIMM slots on either side of the
CPU so you get the same thing right here
with the voltage controller there and
then the the phase is this part so yeah
and ultimately you know you might think
compared to the OC formula and compared
to the rampage six apex this has less
memory phases this is going to be worse
at memory overclocking well again ddr4
pulls so little power it's a very low
strain like very low power strain device
so it doesn't actually matter how many
phases you put on this ultimately what
matters is the trace layout and the BIOS
you find like the the BIOS programming
that's what really decides memory
overclocking know how many phases you
throw at the memory slots because the
memory doesn't really use that much
power
and that's why EVGA opted for you know
that's why I guess EVGA decided that
they're gonna go with just one phase cuz
it really doesn't matter I have one of
these boards for for tech like I have a
review sample of this board to test with
and it's incredible like the the four
memory slots that EVGA has opted for
they work they really really work like
this board is beastly at RAM
overclocking on sky like X it's
ridiculous so you know as much as it
would make sense to complain that this
doesn't have to phase memory power I
couldn't care less this board is
absolutely amazing at memory
overclocking like EVGA no evidently no
what they were doing when they just
decided to you know not bother with
wasting board space on more more phases
that ultimately wouldn't do anything and
instead went and really like nailed the
BIOS and and tres lay outside of the of
the memory memory overclocking here
because this thing's a beast
Lumi who was the number one overclocker
in finland he's got this board to run 41
41 20 megahertz on ddr4 at CL 12 and
I've gotten to 39 50 and I'm very very
close to making 4,000 working at CL 12
as well the last little vrm that is
worth mentioning kinda the VPP rail is
conveyed by a fully integrated buck
converter which is a eye are 38 99 and
that's a 10 amp output part but I don't
know how much power VPP actually pulls
and this VPP that's of EPP DDR and this
is basically a supporting voltage for
your memory sticks it doesn't actually
really do much as long as it's a 2.5
volts your memory is going to overclock
just fine you can't you can't actually
change it on this motherboard if I yeah
I don't think there's a BIOS setting
even for this voltage which is fine like
I don't see a problem with that this
voltage never helped anything in all of
my like with all the motherboards where
I had access to that voltage it doesn't
do a damn thing so it's just good that
it's there and again plenty overkill
because this is a supporting voltage
that's main memory power this is just a
minor rail for the memory so yeah that's
that's the V RMS on the EVGA X 299 dark
it doesn't get better than this
literally there isn't any retail
motherboards that I'm aware of that use
better Maus like all the top X is 299
boards for in terms of erm capabilities
use the exact same component tree that
the EVGA x2 99 dark uses for VCC end
like this 12 phase VCC nbrm it's the
same
you would find on an OSI formula as ROC
uses it on a few other boards I think
gigabyte has basically the same vrm but
the EVGA dark takes it a step like EVGA
is dark here takes it a step further
because they put the most ridiculous he
liked the vrm heatsink they have is
amazing it is just awesome and they've
also gone ahead and tried to like the
gold placing is supposed to allow them
to expose the ground plane for better
you know heat dissipation from the PCB
itself but I think they're mostly using
it as a gold trim to make the board look
better which it does so you know can't
really complain about that and yeah so
this is a beast of a motherboard you
know it is absolutely a beast of a
motherboard and huge props to EVGA for
for making you know a motherboard that
does truly compete with the ram-paige
six apex and the OSI formula and from my
personal experience with the OSI formula
and the X 299 dark I like the dark
better and we will go into more details
on all of that in a separate video later
because this is already long enough so
yeah thank you for watching like share
