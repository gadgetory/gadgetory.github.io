trip cross country we've got a couple of
news items and disclaimers to go through
for this week prior to all the expected
major coverage later in the week the
news this week we've got the clouds lead
exploit kind of interesting there's a
new deal itting kit that is for the
cable aiken skylake processors at Mass
Effect system requirements and then of
course risin we can't go five minutes
without talking about right now so I
have a quick thing to say on that
Verizon in our original coverage of the
CPU what Andy permitted us to publish on
day one which i believe it's every
twenty second that coverage included a
disclaimer saying hey don't pre-order
this and the reason we said that is
because generally as a rule GN the site
does not recommend pre-ordering anything
hardware software gains or otherwise and
that holds true with risin it is
hardware when a company posts the prices
the specs and opens pre-ordering but
does not allow in this case because we
didn't have enough time or even have the
unit yet does not allow reviews to go
live that is for only one reason and
that's the drive preorder sales so just
the only reason I'm mentioning this
again is because the hype trains been
out of control lately I've seen non-stop
trizein this rising that rising does
amazing things right as a miracle worker
risin is terrible horizon doesn't have
support for whatever it goes both ways
and it's nonstop so just to kind of
bring everyone back down to earth don't
pre-order will it would be very
reasonable for you to assume based on
historical context that we would have a
review in time for launch that would not
be an unreasonable thing to assume if
you look at our history posting other
CPL GP reviews on or around launch day
wait for our review as always so that
stated and you just make sure it does
what you need in the review there's
different aspects of the processor and
then decide so let's move on from right
in front we just published an article
today about a new security vulnerability
called cloud bleed that was it in by
Eric Hamilton
on the website if you curious for the
full details but the basics of it clouds
lead stems from a service provider
called cloudflare they are effectively a
middle service they sit between the
clients and the server when you're
accessing websites that act basically as
a front motor we use similar front
loading services not cloud player but we
do use the front loading service for our
site it's a very common thing to do and
normally when you access one of these
types of services as a user you never
really notice the only reason that
something like this sits there well
there's a few reasons but the main one
is for security so to use erics quote
from the article it is acutely ironic
that cloud player using a service to
provide security has a security
vulnerability that is a massive because
of the way their service works and also
those things like page caching a house
with flight speed but mostly it's for
ddos protection and cloud-based security
which what that means is that in theory
when a website is compromised or has an
exploit or an injection attack or
something like that in theory a
cloud-based firewall is supposed to help
protect all of the other websites under
that umbrella clouds lead is a
vulnerability we're in a cloud flares
HTML parser could lead to a buffer
overrun where data was stored on
uninitialised memory causing memory
corruption with the right or the wrong
circumstances that user data could be
injected into the webpage the source
code that is and then later cached by
search engines which is obviously a
massive issue cloud player says this was
first discovered in September of 2016
but the biggest point of vulnerability
was heavily 13th to 18th just recently
the company doesn't think that any user
data was exposed in a way which could
threaten their privacy passwords things
like that but just from our own
perspective we're recommending that you
change passwords because of course
they're going to say they don't think
that anything is is in trouble there at
least not until some B's proven so
change your passwords basically there
are a lot of websites that use cloud
player there are I believe 150 or more
that were implicated in this a
vulnerability and they have not released
and probably will not release the full
list because of
a lot of reasons but you can check the
article gamers x2 thought net or hit the
link in the description below for some
of the sites that were affected now just
a quick primer change.org pretty big
site was affected and even discord was
affected by this so with all the risin
is going on we've almost forgotten about
kb lake but there is a new d letting kit
for it we still have plans eventually to
do we have a rocket kit for deal it in
the 7700 k eventually hopefully just
after rising but the nuke it is from
aquacomputer and it is called dr. deal
it d lids the sky lake and kb lake
processors if you have either one of
those and the kid is pretty
straightforward it separates the IHS and
the substrate by just rotational force
so you socket the cpu into the d litter
and spin it and in theory it should just
stop very very cleanly and easily
without any screws or or anything like
that no razor blades as you may have
seen in other videos the replicate the
only thing that's really kind of
interesting that i wanted to point out
is that it's got a simple clamp just a
vice grip basically that holds the cpu
in its socket for when you're reapplying
an adhesive to hold IHS to a substrate
so it'll stick on there and you can walk
away from it while it cures but that
should retail for about thirty dollars
that is dr. D lid we haven't actually
looked at it in person or anything but
wanted to point it out to say these
things seem to be becoming more popular
now with kb lake and how much
temperature headroom you can get from d
letting the processors in gaming news
that pertains to hardware Mass Effect
Andromeda now has its system
requirements and recommended specs
revealed and that's officially this time
so by where is recommending for the CPU
a 4790 i7 CPU or an 8350 FX CPU for the
processor and then for the GPU they're
suggesting a GTX 1063 gigabyte or our X
480 4 gigabytes video card with memory
suggested as in the recommended specs at
16 gigabytes that's kind of interesting
in a bit different but the rest of it's
not so bad really requirement we're
looking at windows seven for the
baseline OS so when seven is supported
the
the API is direct x 11 it's not obvious
from windows 7 support and then the cpu
baseline requirement hard requirement 35
70 or 60 to 50 from the FX line or
better what's the GPU being a gtx 660 or
HD 7850 two gigabyte card were better
7850 by the way was our first ever
official test bench video card anta and
hasn't aged so well in monitor news and
manufacture a hace just announced new
curved 16 by 9 displays both with an
1800 are curvature both panels are VA
type 1 at 27 inches the other at 31 dot
5 with 1080p and 1440p resolutions
respectively refresh rates on these
panels are also matched each at 144
hurts with a 4 millisecond great great
response and adaptive sync capabilities
though neither is certified for free
sync right now it is theoretically
possible that they could be and AOS he
also has five more displays that should
be launching in the u.s. shortly we have
those details in the news article on the
website if you're curious about them
availability for the curved displays is
slated for Europe and may in the u.s.
currently has no availability or price
listed so that's it for the news roundup
this is a big week for us we have we
have another events that when this goes
live I'll probably be on the way too so
we have another event in San Francisco
and then we have some other major
coverage because there are a couple
different launches this week so stay
tuned to the channel subscribe for more

always thank you for watching I'll see
you all next time
