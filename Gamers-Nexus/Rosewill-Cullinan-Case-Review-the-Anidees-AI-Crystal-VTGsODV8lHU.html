most modern endeavor since there are
five released a few years ago this is
the one we saw at Computex it takes all
the boxes that have been created by NZXT
sh 440 Corsair 760 t and some of in
winds higher-end cases and those boxes
these days generally include tempered
glass which is got on the sides and the
front and in this case no optical drives
and then of course a power supply shroud
which every case it needs these days
apparently also every case you need RGB
lights but this one opts out of that so
that is the one box that is not ticked
by the Roseville Cullinan otherwise it's
got the tempered glass and that is the
current trend in the PC case market the
Roseville Cullinan mid tower enclosure
was first shown at Computex 2016 and has
since been followed by the new 460 X by
Corsair not to be confused with an Andy
product and was even preempted by in
wins 303 here's the interesting part
since rosewall's Computex unveil case
manufacturer added ease has released its
own AI crystal case which looks
remarkably similar to the Roseville
Cullinan that's because an ADIZ and Rose
will both get their tempered glass heavy
cases from Chinese OEM designer Jones
bow which we believe is a customer of
factory God's being casing NZXT largely
supports with its growing demand
relatedly the NZXT s340 that received
iom powers element modifications
tempered glass by the way likely was
made by god's BK scene earlier this year
prior to the tempered glass fervor
unleashed at Computex by Roseville Jones
Bo all these other companies om designer
Jones Bo now makes its own at QT 0-3
glass panel case the case comes with an
excellent catchphrase - which is quote
chasing on the road have you already
forgotten the beginner's mind this is
part of the modern PC industry - as we
discussed an AR who really makes your
liquid coolers article the manufacturers
mostly buy parts that are pre-made by
engineering or design firms then apply
changes during the production process
courts are for example Institute's a
number of changes on ASA tech coolers
prior to incorporation in the final
course their product but does still buy
an ASA tech liquid cooler at the end of
the day Logitech ware
with its sensor suppliers to customize
firmware for their mice further
differentiating themselves from every
other Avago or PM w or picsArt sensor
out there and these small changes are
what set the companies apart at the end
of the day other than the sticker on the
product warranty RGB LEDs and things
like that but let's talk about the
Cullinan specifically and then go
through all the thermal benchmarks and
testing note that everything we say
about this case pretty much applies to
the AI crystal by an ADIZ it's again
basically the same thing the same is
true for the Qt zero 3 if you see any
other case manufacturer selling what is
effectively a cutie zero 3 or even I
think that product is available in some
European regions standalone the review
points we make here will apply to all of
those the only real differences fan spec
which I'll get to at the end the
Cullinan has an expected street price of
$150 for hard specs the unit is using
five millimeter thick tempered glass
side panels for the left and right four
millimeters in the front
each secured by flathead thumb screws
and four locations for the left and
right side panels a silicon damper sits
between the screw and the glass to
prevent unpleasant metal on glass
contact with the glass itself sitting
loosely on a stand off the front panel
also uses tempered glass that's set
within plastic housing as a single unit
obstructing the front with tempered
glass obviously prohibits any air intake
but this isn't any different from what
we're seeing on modern cases making use
of sleek plastic or metal fronts either
the quartz air 400 C 600 C in NZXT h4
14s 340 cases all use flat fronts with
no mesh and then leverage the depth
between the front of the chassis or
frame and the front panel as the intake
event for the front fans it's an
approach to design that allows for
intake a cleaner front aesthetic and
theoretically reduced noise exposure to
the user by directing the noise out and
away from the front of the case and
toward the back rather than leaking the
noise out of a front mesh to make this
work the enclosure needs to have some
depth between the front panel and the
frame and a grill within that cavity we
found that a grill of about one inch is
ideal for breathability the same is true
for bottom intakes on elevated cases and
a Cullinan meets this recommendation
with a 1.2 inch gap between the front
and the front glass for fans the
Cullinan includes three 120 millimeter
front fans with blue LEDs and one
120-millimeter rear fan with a blue LED
also optional III 120 millimeter top
fans can be fitted though we've
generally found that cooling performance
worsens when using top exhaust fans
within a system that's fitted with a
tower cooler so it'd be best to dedicate
that slot to a radiator if you have one
speaking of the Cullinan supports
radiators up to 360 millimeters long on
the top and front and 120 in the rear
definitely 140 is a bit tight though if
even possible you'd want to check on a
radiator / radiator basis and optionally
the front fans can replaced with 140
millimeter units found on the AI crystal
though you're really not gaining much
from that endeavor other than
potentially some noise reduction if you
run in lower rpm fans the front fans are
already fairly maxed out on their usage
of the entire front surface area and 140
millimeter fans will really just bleed
over some of the air channel on the
steel paneling once you look inside the
case you'll see that there's really not
a lot more room for fans anyway to
breathe through that front mesh the
cases construction is entirely steel
without the glass the enclosure is
fairly lightweight and uses 0.7
millimeter thick SG CC steel but looking
now at thermals the Cullinan case has a
fan speed controller so it's got three
switches one switch on the front with
three toggles and those are a high
medium and low because of the way this
particular controller works and the fans
in the case when you decrease the fan
speed it's also lessening the brightness
of the leds to the point where the
lowest fan speed setting will turn off
the LEDs if you dislike them for thermal
testing as always we're running through
our regular benchmark it's all detailed
in the article link to the description
below which has the full review of this
case if you want more information but
one thing to note as we've discussed in
our GPU content of late high GPU
temperatures in cases do actually matter
so this is a point that we haven't
really made before because GPU boost is
changing the game with 3.0 and with way
and D works now thermals are a big deal
so an extra 5 Celsius granted by one
case or another is enough of a swing
that you can get some additional boost
out of the clock for the GPU if you're
running into a thermal wall and that's
mostly applicable to something
like a reference card like this one
where you've got a week or cooler on it
but it obviously depends on the card
the Cullinan ends up at about thirty 6.5
Celsius delta T for cpu load temperature
you can read about delta T on the site
or on the channel you can learn about it
and that places it right around the
Corsair 400 CN NZXT s340 also on this
chart idle taps for the cpu are at
around 14.5 celsius for the cullinan
with the fans configured to medium
instead of max which is what we just
looked at the noise is theoretically
marginally reduced because you've
reduced the RPM but that also increases
the temperatures the : n CPU temp jumps
up to 39 point one five Celsius load and
sixteen point seven Celsius idle that
makes the medium-speed configuration the
hottest in this list the temperature
difference 4 CPUs with this particular
setup isn't hugely detrimental with GPU
load it's a different story we're seeing
a performance of 60 Celsius for the full
speed fan configuration with an idle of
one point three one Celsius again delta
T over ambient that places the Cullinan
between the N when 303 and Corsair 400
see medium pretty heavily impacts GPU
temperatures as well increasing load by
5 Celsius to 65 point seven three
Celsius and again that's actually kind
of a big deal with the worse cooled GPUs
as we discussed because of boost 3.0 or
whatever you may be using speaking to
build quality and ease of installation
the case is fairly easy to work with in
terms of strictly aesthetics starting
with the front panel or all the panels
actually and the glass terminate cleanly
so there's no bleed over of the glass
hanging over the edge or vice versa
which we've seen in a lot of cases with
worst quality control the steel at 0.7
millimeters thick is certainly not the
thickest we've seen on the market in
winds 303 uses a far thicker steel for
the chassis and that's true for a couple
of the other competitors at this $150
price point as well but the rigidity of
5 millimeter thick tempered glass which
by the way is massive does improve the
sort of structural integrity to a point
that you really can't tell the main
difference here is that when moving the
case around
having that thinner steel with the
really heavy tempered glass does make it
actually a little bit more portable than
it would be if they used a one
millimeter thick steel or something like
that the biggest pitfall of the case is
its failure to accommodate 88 millimeter
tall power supplies our max plat max PSU
is something around a $200 unit and it's
fit in about a dozen cases that we've
worked with this year including some
lower end ones but it did not fit in the
Cullinan to get the unit to fit we had
to remove the PS use a finger guard on
the fan and that's definitely an
oversight by the designers and engineers
of the case and one which could be fixed
if they had just added one extra
millimeter of height to the PSU shroud I
guess if you wanted to you can file down
the metal to get this thin there because
that's just how close it is but it's
easier to buy a shorter PSU the next
pitfall is small and has to do with
cabling the right side panel over here
could use some extra thickness to better
accommodate cables so for cable
management purposes in this case the
glass is exposing the side of the case
where the cables are normally hidden so
that does mean generally depending on
how clean you want to look you'll want
to manage that side of it better because
of the limited space the clearance
between the chassis the motherboard tray
and the glass there's really not a lot
to work with for cable management so
that does take some extra time and you
might want to consider buying braided
cables just because they're going to be
exposed to the outside
in terms of build quality of the glass
itself the paneling helps strengthen the
case when all assembled and makes for
pretty heavy enclosure the glass quality
is exceptionally high - during filming
we tragically drop the panel on a piece
of metal tripod mounting hardware and
the panel received no damage or
scratches at all which is admirable and
worth a mention that's just what
tempered glass is good at you wouldn't
want to do it regularly but it is
high-quality glass as an enclosure Rose
Wells Cullinan is one of the better
cases we've worked with this year it had
a brief advantage in the market when it
was shown at Computex between arriving
which will be within a week or two of
this video and that advantage has kind
of gone now in that there's actually
competition so when this was announced
it was one of the cheaper more workable
mid towers with tempered glass other
than they
like in winds cases if you didn't like
them or they didn't quite fit the bill
now though several other companies have
come out with competitors that includes
Corsairs 460 X which we just saw it
packs and includes the AI crystal which
is this thing but by added ease ease of
installations reasonably well designed
there's tons of space in the ceiling for
working with a radiator and the finished
build looks good in the case the PSU
fitment is the biggest hurdle with the
case but we found that it fits PS use of
85 to 86 millimeters tall without issue
at least ours and that's most power
supplies on the market including the
Silverstone one we inevitably put in
here because the other was just too tall
the super high end power supplies that
are 88 millimeters tall will have
fitment issues and the next challenge
for Rose Wells take on this case is its
competition as mentioned entities is
likely also buying from Jones Bo and
assigned it's AI crystal for $130 after
temporary instant discount but it has a
$21 shipping charge so that brings it up
to the 150 dollar MSRP that entities
already list the case for Rose wills
case will have a $180 MSRP and will be
sold for 150 after instant discount so
basically $150 case and it will possibly
include free shipping because Rosewell
is owned by Newegg and they tend to do
that with their products we're not
positive on that yet but that would be
an advantage where would basically equal
the price of the anodized AI crystal and
the Rose we'll call it in case so with
the real price of each case probably at
about $150 after you account for the
shipping and instant discounts and all
that BS for the most part really you're
looking at the differences between the
two of the differences our Rose will
uses 120 millimeter fans in the front
there's probably no real cooling
advantage there we'd have to test it to
know with the an ADIZ fan specifically
it's not all about the size of the fan
of course it matters how fast it
operates and things like that I guess
you could look at the LED color the AI
crystal II is a white fan or as well
uses a blue one you can choose based on
what you want there and then other than
that it really comes down to things like
support warranties brand name stuff like
that and that's up to you to decide what
you like better the only other thing
worth
mentioning is the naming there's no name
plate on the power supply shroud for the
Roseville Cullinan they put their name
on the front in glass and then an ADIZ
puts theirs on the power supply shroud
so if you have a preference for what the
logo looks like that's another way to
choose I guess but I would choose based
on warranty support expectations by
brand name things like that and most
importantly choose by price if one of
the cases happens to go on sale just buy
that one really doesn't matter who makes
it for the most part because the price
is the same otherwise the features are
the same otherwise other than what I've
just listed very small things as the
same om so that's really all there is to
say about this as a case the Cullinan
the AI crystal the QT 0-3 it is a good
case I do actually like it as a mid
tower I think it's a little expensive
potentially the competition is going to
be Corsair with their 4 60 X and if you
like it the n1 303 which we liked but
it's a little bit less flashy doesn't
have the tempered glass in the front it
doesn't have the same LEDs obviously in
the front because it's there's no reason
to have them that would be an
alternative to look at that's closer to
the $100 mark it fluctuates between
about 80 and 100 and then if you want to
go cheaper still there's this the NZXT
and the fantex options without the
tempered glass but for tempered glass
you're basically looking at Corsair 460
X the ROS will an ADIZ Jones Bo QT o 3
Cullinan thing which is this and the n1
303 those would be kind of the ones to
look at for the most part Corsair 460 X
we don't have yet but we'll be talking
about more soon so thank you for
