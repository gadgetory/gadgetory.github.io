time before end of year we've got
another one here that ticks all the
boxes this is the Leon Lee alpha 550
which launched alongside its smaller
Leon Lee alpha 330 we saw both at
Computex and they both immediately
ticked all of the boxes tempered glass
on every surface possible vertical GPU
mounts minimal air flow in the front of
the case RGB LED fans and then whatever
other various sundries and accessories
were found with cases at the time this
one came out to be $200 when we looked
at them originally the prices weren't
final so this is a $200 enclosure at
this point the Alpha 330 is $100 and it
kills a lot of the smaller accessories
and the visual elements of this case so
we'll look at this one and then the
review will pretty much apply to the
other one outside of the price
proposition before we get into that this
content is brought to you by the thermal
take flow RGB closed-loop liquid cooler
which is a 360 millimeter
radiator plus 3 120 fans that are RGB
illuminated the if then we'll take it
rain fans at that this is a 4.5 done a
stack pump which is one of the faster
pumps you can learn more at the link in
the description below so first off the
differences between the two cases before
getting into it too much the Alpha 550
contains a few pretty obvious changes
one is that it's physically larger it
also uses that extra size to accommodate
this front door which just pushes out
like that and conceals the front i/o
including USB type-c something that a
lot of cases lack and this one isn't
even an afterthought like the define are
six and several other cases some of the
be quiet ones as well where you can see
that they've basically commandeered a
USB slot and stuck a USB type-c port in
there with a plastic shroud molded
around it
this one accommodates it natively so
that's interesting but that's only on
the 550 model you won't get the front
i/o with the front i/o covered or on the
330 the front IO is also accompanied by
a difference in fan configuration the
330 model only has a rear exhaust fan
it does not include the three
120-millimeter RGB LED front didn't take
fans these fans make up a huge amount of
the price if you're wondering how a case
that's only maybe an inch or two bigger
in any dimension costs $100 more it's
not that I owed panel and it's not the
i/o cover either
it's those fans those fans despite how
effective they are functionally and
practically are expensive if you look at
them they're actually they are ensconced
in metal so the fans have metal shrouds
are on the outside and a thick plastic
interior it's not cheap to make
something like that and that doesn't
necessarily mean it's good or bad it
means that it's expensive which goes
along with what Lian Li does the reason
that this case got so much attention
when we first covered it and everyone
else covered it at Computex is
specifically because of that point Lee
only makes expensive things they are
known for being basically unobtainable
this case at $200 is one of the most
affordable cases Lee ami has ever made
that's saying something so they've
finally learned wait a minute aluminum
is that expensive what if we did steel
and they did steel so they did steel and
then they said you know a case under
$100 just feels wrong so they added one
two three four tempered glass panels
some of which have the partial shrouding
at the bottom like this back went over
here the bottom quarter of it is
actually shrouded in black so they're
doing that thing except they're not
applying it to the entire case like some
of the other cases on the market are the
intake problem is something we'll talk
about in the thermal section but they've
they've tried to compensate this is a
thing we need to talk about again with
cases that have a closed-off front or a
glass front there is a natural trade-off
if you want your PC to look discrete or
low-profile or you just like tempered
glass a lot and you want the front
finish on it then you're going to trade
off on air flow you don't have to trade
all of it there can be changes made to
the case to accommodate this for example
space
not the front panel to be about an inch
away from the chassis we'll give those
fans enough room to pull in some air
from the side you lose some pressure by
nature of making multiple 90-degree
turns in that process but it will help
out significantly with air flow despite
being a closed off face not every case
does that on the market though and it's
not inherently bad to have a closed off
face just like anything else that's
partially subjective or based on user
scenarios there are reasons you would
want that it doesn't mean that you need
to buy the worst possible one for
example the worst possible closed-off
front panel that has poor air flow but
you could buy something and sacrifice
some airflow in exchange for having the
visuals that you want so with that kind
of out of the way what they've done here
is as expected at this point closed off
the front and sacrifice some airflow we
tested with the front panel removed to
see just how much that was but what I
can tell you right now is that this
ventilation on the side is very small
it's not really enough to help
counteract the sort of sleekness or the
visuals that going for with that front
panel not the worst we've seen this here
but you need a bit more space there to
breathe maybe some more space in the
bottom or even some cut out somewhere in
the top would help out on the airflow
front the case does do a couple of
things artistically it's got the sort of
diamond the lattice front finish on it
that's a bit new and different and now
that we have a case that's actually come
whole we can see what it looks like
rather than the one that came in many
shattered tiny glass pieces but that was
more of the carrier's fault than Leo
Mia's fault it you know it doesn't look
too bad it just depends on who you are
as a user the RGB LEDs are really the
main focal point here as they are with
most things at this point but let's go
through some of Patrick's build notes
then we'll get to the thermal and noise
section first of all on the build side
the Alfa 550 is again all glass
externally it's got thin strips of mesh
at the top and the front so both of
those are a bit choked off and it looks
a bit like the BitFenix Shogun that we
previously reviewed there's minimal
brand in here just a subtle edging at
the bottom of the front panel and a
couple of logos embossed on the interior
along with that diamond pattern on the
backlit filters building in the Alpha
550 was pretty easy there was a brief
moment when it seems like the hard drive
caterer is gonna block the power supply
from entering the case like it did in
the BitFenix and so but removing one
thumb screw allows the entire hard drive
cage to slide out easily the front and
top panels are held firmly enough to
avoid danger and there are enough wide
filters clipped underneath to deal with
any potential dust problems the filter
below the case slides out from the side
which is sadly brilliant and not
something that a lot of case
manufacturers do so it's easier to
access them those that slide out from
the back where you would have to
basically pull your system away from the
wall to get access to it the side panels
have nothing to catch them once the
screws are removed which should be
standard by now in tempered glass cases
this is something where Thermaltake
actually is ahead of the game and so you
just have to be a bit careful when
removing the panel's there's a cable
management shield behind the motherboard
held in with heavy duty hinges that
helps squash the nest of RGB fan cables
that you will ultimately have to combat
many cases allow space above the
motherboard for a fan and radiator
mounting but often it's separated from
the rest of the case in the 550 there
are just a couple of inches of clearance
above the motherboard but it's Apple for
most radiators that we can think of
aside from a couple of standouts and
it's still enough to allow for easy CPU
power and other cable routing this is
impressive given that it shares tooling
with the much shorter alpha 330 there
are a cable cutouts in the motherboard
tray but they're at the very front of
the case and are mostly useful for the
fan cables for everything else there's
an excellent cable management bar with
cutouts for velcro ties it doesn't look
like any cables would be able to fit
beneath it but there are cleverly placed
cutouts that allow 24 pin ATX cables to
pass through as well the LED fans bundle
for RGB and 3 PWM wires into a single
plug which is convenient in terms of
cable management but doesn't allow the
fans to be connected to typical fan or
RGB headers instead they must be
connected to Leon Lee's controller this
controller seems like it's replaced an
older design there's only one screw hole
there should be two drilled into the
case for it and there's an empty spot on
front i/o with a diagram of a
labeled RGB but there's no actual button
this indicates to us that there was
intended to be a button at some point in
front i/o for RGB control
however they replaced it with an actual
controller as an a remote controller
there's no mechanical control in the
case there's no software like cam it's
just an LED color and pattern and speed
button that you can adjust via remote on
the bright side there's a lot of
customization available and there are
some wild baked in animations the fans
an LED strip sync well with each other
for the most part our bottom fan was
rotated one turned out of alignment if
you really care and the use of the
remote does allow for more detailed
controls than the usual press button to
change color and besides if your
alternative is something like cam you're
probably better off going with Hardware
fans be it is controlled via a pwm
header attached to the motherboard so
the main benefit of bundling RGB fan and
power together and connecting the fans
to the hub is reduce cable clutter Lee
onliest fans must be connected to Leon
Lee's controller and that RGB controller
must be controlled by Leon Lee's
included remote the Bora 120 RGB fans
are certainly well made from a physical
material standpoint ignoring the
performance of them and currently go for
$40 on Amazon with the controller
included it's understandable that Leon
Lee would want their fans to be
connected to their RGB controller to
make sure they take full advantage of
the individual addressable RGB s but you
do end up limited in where you can
connect them let's get them to thermals
in noise the Alpha 550 comes with three
intake fans and one exhaust so we didn't
bother testing with extra fans or
serious reconfiguration instead we did
the usual vertical GPU test spoiler it's
bad for an air-cooled card with an
open-face and we also tested without the
front panel to see how much it obstructs
air flow start with CPU tortured tests
under the full system torture workload
senior temperature average sixty point
four degrees Celsius over a means and 56
point two degrees Celsius delta T over a
minute with the GPU mounted vertically
that's typical of cases we've tested but
the GPU typically reports a higher
temperature in the vertical orientation
given that is pushed up against a glass
insulator the reason the CPU temperature
goes down in this configuration is
primarily because we've removed some of
the radiative heat coming off the back
weight of the Jeep
you or at least relocated it which will
favor CPU temperatures marginally with
the front panel removed and the filter
left in place CPU temperature plummeted
to forty six point seven degrees Celsius
Delta over ambient that degree of
airflow limitation is to be expected in
a case with so much glass but it also
shows what you're giving up in favor of
a front glass panel the difference of
course comes down to whether the case is
marketed as high airflow in this case it
doesn't have marketing materials that
lay claim to high airflow or high
performance cooling unlike the Enzo and
H 500 P it could however still use help
in that department
the crazy thing here is that there's a
10 degree swing or more by removing the
front panel we're suffocating the CPU
for airflow here the case doesn't have
to be fully redesigned it can still have
glass everywhere and can still have the
Leon Lea look just make more side
ventilation on that front panel and make
it a bit wider give it some more
breathing room at the bottom or the top
and you'll make up for a lot of that
performance with a front panel on the
550 is around the BitFenix Shogun and
the stock in win 303 and CPU cooling
it's definitely warm but Leon Lee has
been trying to make this somewhat of a
functional case rather than exclusively
a showpiece it's still more towards
showpiece though the view 71
significantly lower CPU temperature of
54 point 7 degrees is the strongest
direct competition to the 550 thanks to
thermal takes off set glass panels that
allow air to circulate all around the
case the Alpha 550 runs about the same
as the dark base 700 with its silent
three setting and four degrees warmer
than the airflow marketed to H 500 P as
for GPU temperature that reached fifty
two point three degrees Celsius over
ambient and torture testing but
overheated as usual when vertically
oriented with an average of about 10
degrees higher for 62 degrees when
vertically oriented we are starting to
see boost 3.0 lower the clocks of it as
it continues to climb this isn't an
inherent problem with the orientation
being vertical itself it's a problem
with a typical case dimension and layout
we've tested every vertical mount option
this year that's been afforded to us and
almost every single one of them pushes
the GPU as close to the side panel as
possible that's done for a few reasons
one of them is looks the other is
getting the card away
from the CPU cooler to allow for maximum
clearance but you're ultimately ending
up with open-face air cards against a
giant glass insulator where it's there's
no room for air to get into the card and
when it exits the card it's got nowhere
to go either so you just recirculate it
in hot air this configuration as we've
said in basically every video at this
point is primarily meant for open-loop
cooling that doesn't mean everyone will
use it that way which is why we still
test it with an open phase card to show
you when not to use it open face cards
or when not to use it actually even blow
our cards aren't great a bit better but
as you'll see in our disappointment PC
build that we uploaded still not great
still throttles so ultimately that's a
configuration you use for open-loop
cooling and that's about it
it looks nice but doesn't work well with
open phase cards
removing the front panel entirely only
lowered GPU temperature two degrees to
fifty point one degrees meaning that the
stock configuration is already close to
the best-case scenario and boost
functionality begins interfere in any
way once we get into the hotter
scenarios like vertical orientation
stock GPU temperature was impressively
cool relative to other cases
given that the restrictive front panel
and the warm CBD temperatures were
interfering with pins it's on par with
the stock NZXT H 700 I and third will
take Corp III both cases that performed
well in our testing even though stock
view 71 is less than one degree cooler
60 loops of three marks fire strike
extreme stress test warmed the GPU to
fifty four point four degrees Celsius
delta T of ramit another competitively
cool score so to speak the Alpha 550
does surprisingly well on GPU thermals
and as a factor of how the fans are
aligned with the face of the card the vo
71 is again less than one degree cooler
and the H 700 iron core P 3 are again
roughly equal the three 120-millimeter
fans do a great job of pushing air along
the bottom of the case to the GPU which
is top priority for those anyway blender
rendering on the CPU cost CPU Delta
Theta average forty point nine degrees
Celsius on the same end of the chart as
sealed off cases like the anti p8 and
cases with half as many fans like
fractals define C and mesh by C in stock
configurations there's a fan pushing air
into the CPU cooler and another fan
pulling air out so this is the best the
Alpha 550 can do stock without better
and it's just partly the distance of the
cooler from the front of the panel the
air loses most of its pressure by the
time it gets anywhere and so we end up
with slightly higher temperatures when
working with an air cooler on the CPU
GPU rendering brought the GPU delta-t at
a twenty six point six degrees still
slightly warmer than the Vue 71 but not
by much considering that the worst
result the corsair spec of four was
about 11 degrees higher the 550 is
definitely pulling its weight in the GPU
cooling Department overall as for noise
this is a loud case that shouldn't be a
surprise there are a lot of fans there
120 millimetres they spent up to nearly
2,000 rpm if the spec sheet is to be
believed and 40.4 DBA is audibly
equivalent to the H 700 I and the view
71 both of which are near the top of the
chart for noise levels and by top here
that's generally worst not best the fans
could be turned down for daily use just
make sure to turn them back up for
thermal improvements when working with
heavier workloads the Alpha 550 is a lot
like NZ fcsh 700 I it's a decent looking
case if you're into that kind of thing
with pretty good build quality that's
ultimately dragged down in terms of the
price to performance value proposition
by all the accessories that are bundled
into it however unlike NZXT Sage 700 I
the Alpha 550 comes with a cheaper
alternative the Alpha 330 this is the
one that we think is the most worth
looking into if you can forfeit that
front panel it's worth considering it's
$100 cheaper the Alpha 330 at $100
basically flat is actually a pretty good
deal the build quality of these cases is
reasonably high yes they're a bit warm
but that's kind of the point of buying
the 330 you buy that then you buy better
fans and you resolve that issue for the
most part entirely so that's what we
would recommend looking into the most
you can even get the fans for cheaper
than the extra $100 now you lose a
couple of things but these Leon Leaf
fans again are expensive and not
necessarily for the reasons that drive
performance they look pretty good you
can find similar to better-looking fans
depending on how you feel about them
that's all subjective
and so if you can it's worth doing and
grabbing the smaller case again you just
lose some of the
top so if you want a top radiator
probably consider this one instead as a
case the 550 isn't bad in terms of
strictly its build quality its layout is
even pretty good it follows a lot of the
trends without just being an outright
copy like a lot of the other cases are
right now and it has at least somewhat
unique tooling in here this case is a
genuine actual effort at making a good
case and that's nice to see it is
however very warm in its stock
configuration for air-cooled components
so just consider that and make sure you
plan accordingly with the rest of your
build the case does not claim that it is
the best at air cooling it doesn't claim
that it has super high air flow so you
can only fault it so much because it's
ultimately trying to be more of a
showpiece that has high build quality to
some extent so we do like the case but
it does have a lot of competition the
Alfa 330 is more of what we would point
you toward if you like this one it's
basically the same and it's a lot
cheaper that one competes with the S 340
elite and it's pretty competitive in
that category this one competes with
things like the dark bass pro 900 big a
bit different audience but certainly a
strong competitor it competes with the
NZXT a 700 i which despite its smart
controller we do like quite a lot but
not the smart controller and it competes
with a couple of other cases dark bass
700 and it's fighting some other
enclosures up there at the top of the
list as well if you 71 isn't too far
away bit cheaper similar glass focus so
there's actually a lot of competition
this year at $200 and that makes it hard
for this one to win we do however like
the price proposition of the Alfa 330
and if you don't like the alternatives
of this one subjectively speaking and
while you're left with that one so for
