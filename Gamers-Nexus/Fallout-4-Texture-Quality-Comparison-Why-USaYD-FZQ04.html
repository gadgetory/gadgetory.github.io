dotnet and this is a pullout for texture
comparison which is kind of a loose word
as you'll find throughout this video so
fallout 4 like most modern games has a
settings drop-down to change the texture
quality when you go into the options
menu this has three options medium high
and ultra and using Ultra will consume
more vram on the video card so do you
keep that in mind
Bethesda actually recommends a three
gigabyte minimum vram for the GPUs
allocation for texturing at Ultra now in
our testing we found that the game
consumes about 2.6 to 2.9 gigabytes of
vram at 1080 Ultra and in theory
textures would contribute a large part
to this so then what you're about to
look at is a couple of screenshots these
were taken at 4k and then we have dialed
in on certain parts of the screenshots
to try and really highlight different
textures in the game like signs and
things like that these are not scaled
they are cropped so there's no scaling
going on here the screenshots as you can
see show basically no difference if we
took away the word telling you which
setting was used for the screenshot you
would probably not be able to identify
them and that's because there is
actually no difference between the
textures on medium or ultra or high and
we have found exactly two differences
the two differences are in one
screenshot there's a plant in the bottom
left there the the focus of the
screenshot was the wall the brick wall
but there's no difference there so we
look in the bottom left and you see a
plant that plant is slightly different
in ultra versus low or medium and the
difference is actually not anything to
do with textures at all it has to do
with fallout fours procedural generation
of plant life and foliage and ground
coverage so that's not even related to
textures basically the next light
difference we saw was in this screenshot
of a trash can so again the focus was
the trash can I was hoping based on a
lot of past experience with texture
comparisons that the word on the
and that some of the finer details would
be more blurry or downsampled on the
lower texture resolutions but in the
screenshots it's the same thing you look
in the back right corner we can zoom in
over there and you'll see that the
letters s and a look slightly different
in the in one of the screenshots than
the other one so looking at this fallen
sign in the background you can see some
difference in the texture in the rust
for example and in the s and the a on
the sort of tapestry hanging down you
can see there's less clarity around the
borders of the letters and this is the
only real example in diamond city that
we could find of a texture quality
change and even that took quite a bit of
digging and looking to locate so that is
the texture screenshot comparison of
fallout fours texture resolutions there
is effectively zero performance impact
going from medium to ultra there's a bit
a VRAM consumption that's the the one
thing we can measure but there's no FPS
difference so I'm not I'm not really
sure I understand why the textures are
this way this is certainly not normal we
just did a huge texture quality
comparison in our blackops graphics
optimization guide on the website and
you can see major differences there as
far as fallout 4 though the difference
is is basically non-existent and you can
just run a lower texture setting if you
wanted to to consume a little bit less
of Ihram or something like that so
