interest in a fury X versus Vega Fe GPU
comparison this benchmark looks at
performance from multiple angles
including synthetic tests gaming tests
and spec view production tests all with
a Vega Frontier Edition locked to the
same clocks as our fury X this is mostly
an academic exercise but could yield
some interesting discoveries that help
understand Vega Epis performance better
particularly in workloads with
geometrically complex scenes before that
this coverage is brought to you by the
core g21 enclosure from thermal take a
$70 case with two 4 millimeter thick
tempered glass side panels mesh
ventilation in the front for
breathability a rarity in cases these
days and a power supply shroud with top
mounted SSD sled learn more at the link
in the description below so this test
was very highly requested by the viewers
and the readers on the website if you
have more suggestions we are still
following up on a lot of them but
obviously we can't keep up with with the
requests of potentially hundreds of
users so we're doing our best but this
one today looks at clock for clock
performance that means that we are down
clocking the Vega EFI card and we're
doing so down to 1050 megahertz which is
the out of box speed of this one the
fury acts from 2015 and we do have a
couple of caveats here so differences in
architecture are more or less impossible
to control for in this kind of test
environment differences in memory are
difficult to control for but not
impossible
and then there are plenty of other
potential differences as well but
ultimately we get something that is sort
of an IPC test scare quotes around IPC
because it's not exactly what it is but
you get the idea with memory we still
have a difference in bandwidth of 512
gigabytes per second on the fury X
versus 483 gigabytes per second on the
Vega f/e card that is partly because AMD
is using two stacks of HBM on this one
and four on the fury x so you end up
with a 4096 memory
bit bus versus half of that on the Vega
efi card the difference being made up by
basically Vega at these memory clock
which is 945 megahertz out of box versus
500 megahertz on the fury X and this
also is something
saw in the Walkman tuning where there
actually some leftover bugs we think
from the fury acts in the drivers being
used by Vega epi because Vega Effy's
clocks for memory seem to down clock the
500 megahertz when you change really
anything and wat man but it does work
when you use something like afterburner
or tri xx with other issues introduced
at that point so the point of saying
that is that this testing today 1050
megahertz clock for clock testing should
help us unveil a few things one we might
better understand the potential
difference in driver performance and see
if buggy drivers on Vega Fe could be a
cause of some of the performance
concerns that are being seen by the
community and two are we able to see
some of these smaller parts of vega's
architecture in play when we control for
clock speeds and voltage for example the
small primitive discard that Vega has
which the fury X does not that could be
seen when we're at clock for clock
because we eliminate one of those
essential variables that said even if
you were to control for everything that
we have tuning sliders for so clock down
to 1050 memory down to whatever it needs
to be to be 512 and 512 or 484 and 484
if you control for all of those things
there are still a whole lot of things
that we don't know about one of which is
that as you remove potential limitations
on the GPU from one aspect of the
architecture like maybe memory bandwidth
or maybe the primitives discarding tool
as you remove those limitations you
encounter new limitations and we have no
way of knowing what those are without
basically being an D at that point so
doing our best here to give you an idea
now
first has to get into its firestrike we
have some gaming tests as well and we're
focusing only on Vega and fury X today
so there will not be comparative charts
if you want comparative charts vs. and
video or other AMD products check the
review for Vega EFI that's where you can
find those all tests are at ten fifty
megahertz 1250 millivolts for the
voltage and then for the power target we
set as a plus 50% so there's no down
clocking and we set the fan on Vega Fe
to be unbearably loud that way it's not
going to get hot and throttle itself so
those were controlled for pretty well
let's start with fire strike with fire
strike providing a synthetic baseline
and then later moving on to gain
benchmarks we scripted 3dmark to execute
five times on each configuration as
there's quite some variance in 3d mark
test test and the solids were close
between each run the results are
averaged with fire strike ultra the
stock radeon vega frontier edition card
operated a graphics core of 4906 points
that's our baseline r9 fury x with 10 50
megahertz average a graphics score of 39
74 0.7 after several runs as well with a
range of 21 points across all runs the
Vega EFI card at 10 50 megahertz
averaged the graphics score of 38 89
with a points range of 14 across all
runs that's the largest versus the
smallest the difference is at 2.2
percent favoring and these are nine fury
x over the Vega f/e this could be a
difference of memory bandwidth at this
point but it's hard to say the exact
difference we are confident however that
the difference is outside of test
variance and error there's about a two
percent advantage on P reacts under our
test conditions and if you're curious
this scanning would indicate that the
stock clock the Vega frontier Edition is
about 28% faster than the stock clock
speery X and if you're curious what has
hardware we're using or anything else
about methodology as always you can
check the link in the description below
to find all that out in our 2015 review
of the fury x we noted some interesting
nonlinear scaling across lower
resolutions going from 4k down to 1080
so let's next look at fire strikes
extreme and normal 1080p benchmarks to
see how that affects things and fire
strike extreme which is basically 1440p
the fury x again is roughly tied or
marginally ahead of the Vega f/e 10 50
megahertz card the lead held by the fury
X cannot be confidently declared as a
consistent advantage test to test the
variance is high enough at least here
that we're able to call these results
effectively identical in our original
fury X review the card closed the gap on
some competitors when getting closer to
4k resolution we're seeing some of that
here where the fury x held a noticeable
and measurable lead of 2.2% at 4k but no
significant difference at 1440p
let's see if that continues at 1080p and
fire strikes at normal benchmark 1080p
the Vega FPS star card
a graphics score of 21,000 355 for our
baseline the rni in fury X operated a
score of 16 5-3 1.7 the range of 85
points and Vega f-e at 10 50 megahertz
operated a score of 16 7 4 9.3 points
for the range of 37 points the tables
have now flipped the fury X is behind by
13% where it had previously tied or held
a lead over Vega at E at 10 50 megahertz
let's take a closer look at the
individual tests that comprise bio
strike to better understand performance
behavior so here's the important stuff
to know fire strike has two graphics
tasks within it will produce two numbers
graphics fps 1 and graphics fps - and
those are combined with all the other
aspects of fire strike to create your
total your combined on your graphics
scores the graphics scores being what we
just need at the moment ago for the FPS
scores we get a better look at where the
differences emerge between these two
cards because the two tests gt1 graphics
test 1 is a tessellation heavy test it
has a high poly count it is very focused
on a lot of quads a lot of primitives a
lot of Polly's basically geometric
complexity is what you're looking at
with gt2 you're primarily looking at a
heavier compute workload and that also
could correlate with a higher stress on
memory bandwidth so we can see a
potential difference here being at 512
and for 84 but for the rest of it for
the first test GT 1 there's a potential
advantage for Vega because of its newer
geometric handling so the geometry
pipeline has changed and has the small
primitive disk Carter that we saw on
Polaris and detailed when the RX
400-series launched last year around
this time looking at the results for FPS
1 and FPS 2 in the fire strike 1080p
test with fps one being GT 1 the
geometrically complex test we see that
Vega is notably ahead in GT 1 roughly
4.5 percent and about 1.2 percent behind
in GT 2 the other tests show the same
trend but with a lessened difference at
higher resolutions the firestrike 4k
attacks for example which is fires like
Ultra posted Vega Fe in the lead
consistently at around 20 dot for 1 FPS
for
gt1 but behind the consistently at
around 14.4 for FPS for gt2 this
behavior is mirrored to 1080p but the
difference is lessened as GPU load
increases so it becomes a lot less
significant at the higher resolutions
and at fury X starts to make up ground
at the higher resolutions which is what
we saw in our initial review of it two
years ago this is interesting data for
Vega and P reacts and it's the first
step to better understanding Vegas
performance in our next test coming up
because we now know that potentially in
the more heavily tessellated or
geometrically complex scenes there's a
possibility that Vega FPE comes out
ahead of the fury X at least clock for
clocks being the main focus here because
stock it will pretty much always be
ahead but Clarke for Clarke is what
we're looking at so that's the first
step now we don't have a 100% for sure
answer as to the reason for the
performance we're seen in those fire
strike results but we've got a pretty
good educated guess hypothesis that it's
basically geometry choline and
tessellation choline and primitive
discarding happening on the vega card
with GT 1 and then GT 2 you're
potentially seeing either a memory
bandwidth difference or just some other
architectural difference that allows the
Fury acts to be at least marginally
ahead of the Vega efi card but GT 1 is
where we see the more significant
difference and it's reasonable to assume
and make an educated guess that that's
because of the primitive discard
architectural differences which do not
exist on the periods moving into gaming
and covering production last let's
resurrect a benchmark from another era
we're looking at Metro last light which
gives us granular control over
tessellation specifically so we'll have
a line plot showing trend of performance
in a moment but we're starting with the
stateful benchmarks with 4k and very
high quality settings supported by high
tessellation the r9 fury X operates an
average FPS of 43 lows at 33 and 27.7
fps 0.1% and the Vega epi 10 50
megahertz card the down clock 1 sustains
a 39.3 FPS average with comparable time
that lows to the average this places the
fury X about 9% ahead at 1440p with the
same settings baron
we saw a 9% lead for the Fury accent
moment ago at Fort a the fury X now runs
a 78.3 FPS average against the 10 to 3
megahertz Vega fps 70 4.3 FPS average
the gap has closed a bit the fury act
now is reduced to a 5.4 percent lead
rather than 9 percent finally with 1080p
at very high and high tessellation the
same settings we've used for the other
two the fury X operates a 100 11.7 FPS
average with a 1050 megahertz Vega
variant at about 112 FPS average so
they've more or less tied at this point
now that we've gotten to 1080p let's
plot a performance trend line with all
the different tessellation settings
starting with average FPS the average
FPS is on the left and the lower
horizontal axis is for the tessellation
settings in Metro last light this is
where it gets interesting here with
average FPS plotted for 1080p we see
that the theory axe retains a stronger
lead with tessellation disabled on the
far left but loses that lead as
tessellation becomes more demanding
ultimately giving way to a very slight
bump at the end for Vega however that
slight bump at the end is within our
standard deviation so we can call that
effectively tied at the higher
tessellation settings if we can further
increase tessellation settings in this
benchmark we'd suspect this trend would
continue normal tessellation starts to
close the gap but not much and high
tessellation is the real turning point
for Vega standard deviation for these
tests was 0.577 FPS basically 0.58 as
for 0.1% low metrics these follow mostly
the same progression as seen in this
line graph high is the turning point
once again with a slight advance for
fury acts when tessellation is off and
mostly tied towards the far right end of
the plot moving to doom at 4k Ultra was
Vulcan and async compute the stock Vega
F II card operates in average FPS of 60
4.2 was a fury X at 58 at 4 FPS average
and the Vega Fe 10 50 megahertz version
at 57.5 FPS average doom isn't an
intensive enough game to test at lower
resolutions given its FPS cap so we'll
save that for the next title with Ghost
Recon wildlands at 4k first we're seeing
the stock Vega F II card operate a frame
rate of roughly 37 out seven okay
average with lows at 34 1% and 33 at
7:01 1% that's our baseline the fury X
at 10 50 megahertz operate 832 FPS
average with lows at 39 and 25 this
place is the fury X about 15% behind the
Vega F II card though its low end
performance weakens a bit at 10 50
megahertz the Vega FP card operates its
average at 33 FPS marking at 5.3 percent
behind the fury X or about 19.6% behind
our baseline card which has a 1600
megahertz clock moving to 1440p the gap
now minimizes just like we saw with fire
strike if you recall those numbers of
Vega FPS stock runs a baseline score of
62 FPS average as the card stretches its
legs a bit at the lower resolutions
we'll see this continue with 1080p one
or 7.1% lows are maintained relatively
close by the fury X operates at 50 FPS
average with 0.1% local frame times
consistently around 36.3 fps part of
this may be game level optimization at
this point on the developer's end as the
fury ax is old enough to see waning
support from developers more importantly
the Vega EFI card at 10 50 megahertz
scored effectively the same 49.7 FBS
Everage vs again 50 with some of its
test passes scoring that to the FPS mark
and others at 49 so again basically the
same this resolution equals performance
of the cards and that we see a slight
gain for Vega in the 0.1% loaded
apartment let's look at 1080p to build
some more resolution scaling data our
baseline Vega fe card performed with an
average FPS of 81 with this resolution
the fury X runs 60 3.3 FPS average again
effectively equal in performance given
test to test variants those have also
evened out in this test as VM
consumption has gone down and load has
lightened
this particular set of data aligns very
well with fire strike where we see
performance equalized at resolutions
lower than 4k the fury X always did
perform better at 4k even in our
original review years ago that seems to
maintain at least somewhat true today we
only ran for K for GTA 5 the numbers
position the fury X at 43 FPS average
and the F ecard at 10
megahertz at forty point seven FPS
average this is outside of variance and
is a measurable and repeatable result
placing the clock for clock Vega F II
card at five point three percent behind
the fury act and IPC so to speak but can
i - is of a singularity with directx12
high settings and a 4k resolution Vega
Fe stock card establishes a baseline of
69 dot for FPS average the very acts at
ten fifty megahertz at stock speed run
65.4 FPS average with low-end frame time
performance slightly more behind and
setting Vega Fe to ten fifty produces a
fifty 7.3 fps results with lows behind
the fury X this makes the Vega Fe ten
fifty megahertz card about twelve
percent slower than the fury X in this
test and makes the fury X about five
point eight percent slower than the Vega
Fe stock card for our last gaming test
were using Sniper Elite for at 4k with
DirectX 12 and high settings with async
compute enabled the Vega Fe stock card
provides a baseline performance of 53.3
FPS average with the fury X 10 50
megahertz card at 50 1.5 FPS average so
the fury X is still behind Vega when
stock but matching clocks places at Vega
at 51 FPS average so pretty close you
see are effectively equal and are within
our standard deviation for this test you
cannot confidently declare that one is
faster than the other when clocks are
matched clock doesn't seem to be making
a linear difference here either and once
we get another over fog in attempt then
we wouldn't expect to see big gains from
Jesse core clock modifier in this
particular game regardless vega fe and
fury ax with equal clock speeds are
roughly equal in performance for sniper
leap for we're moving on to spec view
perf tests now which will provide some
production level workloads for the
charts and for some perspective outside
of gaming the titan XP will not make an
appearance here if you want to see how
to tighten XP compares to vega fe they
do trade blows in a couple of the tests
then check the vega f ee review that we
posted already here's what we've got
with 3ds max the vega f ii card has a
stock weighted performance of 140 9.3
FPS with the ten fifty megahertz version
at a 120 1.5 FPS weighted average so
positive scaling is posting a 23 percent
gain with a fury acts at ninety two
point seven FPS that place with the vega
fe ten fifty megahertz card at 31
percent
of the fury X at ten fifty megahertz
much different than what we saw with
gaming and even with fire strike moving
to Katia the Vega EFI card stock
operates 19% faster than a 10 50
megahertz card which in turn operates
55.4% fascism the same clocked fury X
the energy test is next and gains about
a two x performance of lead by moving to
the Vega card from fury X o'clock four
o'clock note this is not a power
consumption test it's a specific test
named energy or sometimes power you may
see online in the spec you perv sweet
Maya Post scaling of 40% for the FE card
which seems to align with other dx11
tests as well the snx test is one of the
most interesting though this test is
generated from Siemens NX software with
model sizes that are 7 million to 8.5
million vertices in complexity this is
engineering software and the fury X gets
eviscerated here and is multiplied
nearly seven times over in performance
by the clock for clock Vega F e card
with this particular pro application
Vega Fe appears to be showing its
strength in vertex processing again with
seven to 8.5 million vertices depending
on which scene is being rendered in this
particular engineering software this
testing tells us a few things but be
careful about drawing definitive
conclusions here we certainly will not
be because it's still kinda too soon to
tell for example how this performance
extrapolates to rx Vega which is what
most of you and our core audience are
interested in so just again disclaimer
to be careful about extrapolating
anything look at it as an academic
exercise we can potentially learn some
things about how this card performs but
let's let's kind of be careful about how
that translates other cards so
specifically to Vega F e some of the
differences we saw could be explained by
partly a memory bandwidth difference
it's not necessarily huge but there is a
difference 512 44 that's part of it but
not a big part the bigger part
potentially is some of the geometry and
primitive sculling performance that we
see on Vega Fe
in theory the in theory because speaking
with build Zoid as well and a couple
other folks in the industry we're not
100% positive that the geometry choline
is working properly right now on this
card with these drivers
for the games at least so that stated
that difference could change going
forward we're not sure the other
difference you could tend to be looking
at a driver performance increase this
has been something we've been saying
since the review be very careful about
how much you are expecting from a driver
release in terms of performance gains
especially with an unreleased product Rx
Vega be careful what you're expecting
but it is reasonable to expect some kind
of performance gain with the driver
update in the very least it would
eliminate some of the bugs that we've
seen with afterward for instance there
are plenty of bugs that we've talked
about in the past so there's not going
to be any harm done from a driver update
unless they make it worse that's that's
only a good thing to look forward to for
the most part but we don't know exactly
how much of the lymphatic performance
going forward so geometry : is part of
it the memory performance is part of it
in terms of bandwidth and then if you
encounter a game where you're drawing
more than 4 gigabytes on the memory then
there's potentially going to be an
advantage of the 16 gigabyte card but
that's just it's not the most common
thing and remember that if you use
something like gpu-z to tell you the
memory usage it's not actually the
memory that's necessarily being utilized
by the game or actively deployed it's
the memory that's been requested by the
application so it's kind of on standby
that doesn't tell you what's actively
utilized so keep that in mind as well
but anyway cool academic exercise if you
want to discuss it
feel free to below this gives you a
baseline for answering the question of
what's the clock for clock performance
because so many of you asked and it was
an interesting thing to do so hopefully
that helps with that we've got plenty
more tests to do with this card we still
have no no firm statements on what to
expect for our X Vega other than we will
be reviewing it wait for our review so
