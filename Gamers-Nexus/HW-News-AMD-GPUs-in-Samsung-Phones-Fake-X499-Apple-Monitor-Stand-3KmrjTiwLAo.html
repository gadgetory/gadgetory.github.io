hardware news recap for the past week we
already covered at Google stadia and a
standalone piece right after the
announcement so check that out if you
want that news but for this one we're
focusing back on PC hardware and one of
the bigger news items headlining this
one is AMD and Samsung and now it's not
they're working together on a strategic
partnership to license the rDNA
architecture for mobile devices that's
one of the bigger news items of today's
show we also have a further discussion
on the us-china trade war and how it's
impacting PC prices and the PC industry
some layoffs recently as well and then
we'll be talking about AMD and its x86
licensing to China for first generation
and what's happening after that along
with some critical updates to Windows
that you'll definitely want to grab
before that this video is brought to you
by Thermal Grizzlies conduct a not
liquid metal conductor nada is what
we've used in all of our liquid metal
and delayed thermal tests capable of
dropping CV thermals significantly and
replacing the stock thermal interface
over CPU thermals don't just allow
better overclocks but also lower noise
levels because the transfer efficiency
is increased the mix of gallium and
indium makes for a thermal conductivity
of 73 watts per meter Kelvin outclassing
traditional pastes significantly learn
more at the link in the description
below so quick GN Store news item first
we restocked the blue with gold trim
beer glasses if wanting one of those
they are on store like Aaron's Nexus
dotnet fully restocked and all the SKUs
thank you for your patience on that Andy
and Sam son announcing a strategic
partnership for Radeon intellectual
property Andy and Sam son are looking to
form a joint multi-year partnership that
would see AMD licensing its Radeon
graphics IP to Samsung Samsung plans to
leverage the AMD graphics technology
specifically the rDNA architecture that
was disclosed at Computex a couple weeks
ago and these keynote for use with its
own ARM based Exynos chips inside of
mobile devices and our DNA is what lisa
sue onstage was talking about being used
to four at na'vi coming up on the
desktop side this will likely allow
Samsung to replace its existing Mally
GPUs which is more ARM based
intellectual property and it also gives
Andy Radeon graphics yet another
platform
and revenue stream to grow up on this is
something Andy has struggled with in the
past where it's well up until risin and
even for horizon first gen Andy has had
to work with semi custom solutions
somebody custom partners like the
consoles with pretty low margins to try
and gain some market share wealth to try
and gain some money back so that they
can then try and get in some market
share back in the discrete component
space so what's going on here is it
looks like Andy having made inroads with
its graphics IP outside of the PC
industry is going to have a continually
successful semi custom strategy and
should start to build some additional
revenue that it can then divert for
other investments internally Andy hopes
to deliver solutions and is already on
tap for delivering solutions for the
immediate next-gen consoles by both Sony
and Microsoft and this is in addition to
Google stadia which again we discussed
in a separate piece a couple yesterday
at the time this one live for stadia
using Radeon graphics so Andy's got a
couple of olive branches out there right
now and it looks like even if some of
these are lower margin it's starting to
build a platform upon which it can
potentially scale to maybe grow its
discrete GPU division again because that
is where Andy's hurting a lot right now
versus Nvidia in the PC industry so
partnering with one of the biggest phone
manufacturers is certainly a potentially
beneficial move for Andy we don't know
the details obviously on the partnership
in terms of financials but I it should
be a good move certainly you'd hope
they're not losing money so AMD may be
able to carve out a new path to market
its Radeon and rDNA architecture moving
forward and this is something that we'll
pay attention to even though we don't
cover mobile devices this is relevant to
the PC industry AMD is a it's not a
small company but relative to Intel it
is a small silicon manufacturer when you
look at the the sheer size of someone
like Intel or even on video which is a
massive company as well so given that
AMD is the smallest of the big three
that we work with on this channel any
move like working with Samson or Sony or
Microsoft will impact how AMD grows and
performs financially in
our industry as well because it's it's a
small enough company not small but small
enough relative to the others that
partnerships like these impacts the
bottom line and potentially a
significant way as they begin to
accumulate so that's interesting news
for AMD and something that we look
forward to following more closely
speaking of AMD an additional handy news
the other big announcement of the past
week other than stadia was the new Mac
Pro which has received unrelenting
mockery online particularly for its
monitor stand and this isn't really
technically in in the news document
today I think we think when Eric was
working on this one he decided it wasn't
worth giving a further beating but the
the note here I'll make is that there
was a monitor stand announced it was at
Apple's event it's it's a mod understand
that's that's literally all it does it's
not special it's not magical as Apple
likes to call their devices it doesn't
even have one button the thing Apple is
best known for no it's it's a monitor
stand and it's literally a thousand
dollars that's all it is it is a one
thousand dollar monitor stand for your
monitor that does not come with its own
stand anyway alongside the
groundbreaking revolutionary monitor
stand news which has undoubtedly over
actually not even not even jokingly it
has legitimately overshadowed pretty
much everything else because of the
mockery its received aside from the
monitor stand there was also some AMD
component reused in the new Mac Pro and
this is interesting stuff because it's
not something that was released
separately for the DIY market so inside
of Apple's new cheese grater there are
AMD workstation class GPUs that will
come in two flavors
there's the AMD Pro Vega 2 and the Andy
Pro Vega 2 duo for the time being and it
seems and these newest cards will be
solely available inside Apple's newest
Mac Pro workstation although we'll
hopefully see this change the new AMD
Pro Vega 2 cards are based on AMD second
generation Vega architecture while using
seven nanometer Vega 20 silicon the Andy
Pro Vega 2 offers 64 compute units
or 4096 stream processors the cards
clock rate tops out at 1700 megahertz
and it's capable of 14.2 teraflops of FP
32 compute performance the pro Vega 2
card will also make use of 32 gigabytes
of HB m to memory across a 4096 bit
memory bus delivering up to one terabyte
per second memory bandwidth and the
reason this is fun for enthusiasts is
because the pro vega 2 duo returns an d
to its dual GPU days something we
haven't seen for a little while
295x2 is probably one of the more recent
ones that we can all remember so this
offers to Vega 20 dies atop the same PCB
and the pro vega 2 effectively doubles
the previous specifications 128 to use
equal to 81 92 stream processors between
the two devices 28.4 teraflops of FP 32
if you'd like to add it that way and you
can't really can't really do this but 64
gigabytes of HP m2 cumulatively between
the tier now ultimately if each one has
its own Bank of 32 gigabytes so but
still it's a lot of memory on on one
card and now of course Andy's infinity
fabric is the connecting link for all of
this so the interconnect the GPS will
communicate through is infinitive an
infinity fabric branded and it's got 84
gigabytes per second of bandwidth per
direction and no word on price yet
individually anyway but the GPS will
likely cost as much as a good used car
the Mac Pro though so Eric Hamilton does
our news roundup since Krypton does a
fantastic job of it but Eric did not put
the Mac Pro in here and I'm actually
glad about that because the hell I was
meant to go off-script for a second did
anyone see that the Mac Pro thing we
don't really follow Mac too much but
we're Apple but um so the the case
design it's something that it seems like
it leans more on the performance side
it's got holes in it so that's actually
good it's something we like seeing we
probably won't realistically be able to
test it with our ATX test bench it
doesn't look like it'll fit we'd have to
custom modify it and the problem is the
only way we're working on this thing is
if we buy it and then after reviewing it
turn it and I'm out sure they'll take it
back if I take a dremel to the case but
maybe I could say it came that way so
anyway we're probably not gonna look at
it
if we do we'll look up the whole system
it doesn't look like a TX case
benchmarking is going to work in this
one without modifications and we they're
like six thousand dollars there's some
things I'll pay for we're not only not
going to make ROI on six grand we will
lose a lot of money so I'm not sure
that'll happen a lot of you have
requested a tow so I didn't want to
address it anyway Samsung could ours
TSMC as Nvidia's at foundry partner of
choice for seven nanometer that's
another big news item here it's it's a
lot of silicon manufacturing news lately
so according to some of the reports in
the industry lately one of them being
from industry soothsayers digit times
who publish a lot of actually really
interesting stories and videos intending
to tap Samsung as its fab partner for
seven nanometer ampere as far as we know
ampere is intended as the successor to
taurine and if that's not the name it
doesn't matter there's a successor to
Torian at some point that's what we're
talking about there are precious little
details about the architecture other
than a 2020 release window for the next
one it's been expected that Nvidia would
continue its long partnership with TSM C
but another report by EE x claims that
samsung is quote aggressively
undercutting
tsmc with its own seven nanometer EUV
note samsung landing and vidya as its
seven nanometer partner is certainly
something that would take the shine away
from TSMC who've been leading the pack
in terms of foundry processes lately and
landing major deals with people like AMD
who are growing right now quite a lot
the EE Times report said quote
separately one source said that Samsung
is aggressively undercutting prices
we're at 7 nanometer node with UV or
extreme ultraviolet lithography offering
some startups a full mask set for less
than a multi-layer mask
MLM said at its rival TSMC introduced
the MLM mask sets in 2007 to lower cost
for small volume runs they are said to
be about 60% of the cost of a full mask
set as Tom's Hardware notes cabassa
could also be a consideration TSM sees
at seven nanometer node has been seen a
burgeoning demand as of late with AMD's
rise in 3000 and epic roam as well as
apples a 13 ship coming later in the
year this news item is going to be a
little bit longer but the us-china
relations
as it pertains to trade and tariffs do
impact the industry it impacts PC
hardware prices at some level already
has and will continue to do so in fact
at Computex just about a week ago when
we were closing out the show we were
talking to some of the case
manufacturers and what their price
targets were for cases coming out and a
lot of them were about $10 higher for
the US than they had been planned when
the cases were in development for the
past maybe between 6 and 18 months to
put in what case it was so it is
impacting things now there's more to
talk about here MSI is apparently
preparing for the worst and its own
words the EVGA
has now publicly mentioned some layoffs
internally and there are server server
market pains as well also DRAM market
pains although no one feels bad for Dean
or at matrix right now given the last
several quarters of borderline gouging
prices the u.s. trying to trade
conflicts continues to have adverse
effects on many facets of the tech
industry tensions between the US and
China for example have resulted in
Huawei getting more or less blacklisted
some of the ramifications from that
haven't fully been realized yet either
on top of that many American tech
companies are being forced to drop their
business with Huawei from that specific
example and the newest revelation is the
impact that this will likely have on the
DRAM market so DRAM exchange a division
of trend force pointed out that quote as
ripples from the US band continued to
spread Huawei's shipments of smartphone
and server products are feared to face
heavy obstacles for the next two to
three quarters impacting peak season
demand for drm products for second half
and the time of price precipitation
trend Force officially adjusts its
outlook for a third quarter DRAM prices
from its original
prediction of a 10% decline to a widened
10 to 15% decline this was posted on
DRAM exchange the report also notes that
DRAM could rebound in 2020 behind
bottoming prices and limited bit growth
until then it's unlikely that anyone
empathizes with the do game makers given
the last several quarters of again
really high prices and murmurings of
price fixing and actual government
investigations into it meanwhile PC
vendors like MSI have been caught
directly in the crossfire of the tariff
increases in the trade war and Tom's
Hardware was able to catch up with MSI
CEO Charles Jian at Computex 2019 where
he stated MSI was preparing for the
worst the full quote was I've been very
very busy lately you always need to
prepare for the worst right right now
the 200 billion dollar in trade is
already at 25% tariff and then we were
worried the next wave will be 325
billion dollars in goods at 25% tariff
that's why we need to prepare for the
worst so what I'm doing right now we
will move more and more capacity back to
Taiwan it is our short and midterm
strategy in the long term we will go to
Vietnam or somewhere but Taiwan is the
short term solution that is the only way
we can do it right now and that's the
quote from MSI CEO directly as obtained
by Tom's Hardware
who were at the show as well this isn't
the first company we've heard of moving
manufacturing back to Taiwan or not
China in general we visited MSI's
factory in China not long ago and about
March just before all of this started
happening and when we were there they
had already told us that there was about
a 50% workforce reduction over the past
few years as the company has moved to
automate a lot of its lines now from
what the company and other companies in
China have also told us apparently it's
not so easy to get the factory laborers
that you would typically employ for
those positions anymore because in
Shenzhen and dong-gwon a lot of the
workforce has moved more towards the
service industry and away from the the
factory life but that was largely
surmounted with automation and a lot of
it but now it looks like these companies
are mostly moving
their operations to Taiwan despite a lot
of the the larger of the manufacturers
owning the factories that they use in
China and that's pretty rare most the
time companies will source factories but
don't actually own them so not sure
exactly which companies we we can
publicly say our back in Taiwan for
manufacturing but suffice to say most of
the board partners that we work with
regularly are either actively moving or
have already moved manufacturing to
Taiwan and gigabyte publicly has a
factory in Taiwan which is at more or
less maximum capacity now more than
previously and that's a factory we've
actually toured two gigabyte is using
that factory primarily for high-end
boards and then they're still in China
for most of their other stuff and we'll
be looking at other solutions for longer
term so some vendors have been able to
absorb the first wave of the tariffs
without sacrificing pricing others are
trying to wait it out some like MSI for
instance are moving product lines out of
China altogether or trying to with a
little to no incentive to return at
least not in the immediate future the
terrorists have already affected our
products as well @gn so the mod mats we
took a there was a tariff hiked ten
percent last year 2018 end of year and
we absorbed that cost ourselves the
tariff hike now will impact us again and
we were worried that the tariffs might
force us to increase mod net prices but
I've spent the personally the better
half of the last week working with our
our partners our distribution partners
and manufacturing partners in trying to
find ways to cut costs elsewhere without
cutting product manufacturing costs
without reducing the quality of the
product and without increasing our
prices so we found some good solutions
where we eat a little bit of margin
again so it's starting to suck a lot but
we're not losing money so that's good
and we're making enough money where we
can justify making the mats obviously
and we don't have to raise the prices
which is fantastic but to do that
required a lot of work on on on my part
on our partners side of things and the
end result is that we found a few clever
places
to cut some of our cost without
sacrificing anything and a lot of those
have to do with with things like I mean
shipping and logistics like do we put
more of them on a boat instead of a
plane that saves a lot of money but it
does mean that we have a 60 day cycle
between Matt inventory arriving so we've
managed to split the orders a bit in a
way that saves us some money gets the
mats and early enough to meet the next
orders and then the rest of them will be
following that on a bit of a latency but
the cost comes down in a way that we
don't have to increase the prices so
anyway long story short it affects us
too
so finally the server market continues
to see some uncertainties as well as a
result of the us-china trade war and
there's another quote here from digit
times this one says as suppliers for the
cloud computing data center segment are
still clearing their inventory and
us-china trade tensions have created
uncertainties demand for data center
servers has been decreasing since early
2019 and may cause Intel's data center
business group to suffer its first on
your revenue decline in 10 years in 2019
so the problem that the server market
faces appears to be two-pronged Huawei's
blacklisting will cause major server
outfitters like Intel and NVIDIA to lose
revenue and more to the point
China could retaliate by boycotting some
US goods cutting server companies off
from the Chinese market period or in
large part and then back to the mod mats
briefly being a smaller manufacturer
we're able to allocate all of our time
for the amount of time needed to figure
out pricing in a way that it doesn't go
up for people buying the product we I
personally really don't want the price
to go up like we're pretty happy with
where they are losing margins not fun
obviously but we'd rather take a bit
more of a margin hit again then increase
the prices so can't guarantee this
forever if the tariffs keep going up it
will eventually force us to increase
prices we're doing our best to stay
ahead of it we are very proactive in
this and anyway obviously our number-one
goal here as a smaller manufacturer
where I'm directly involved it's not
like some CEO super top level
20 steps above the product being made I
mean this was my product my goal is to
make sure people can actually get it at
the price that we want to sell it for
not at a higher price then you know that
starts pricing people out so anyway
that's the goal moving on and they will
no longer license x86 chip designs to
China and these 2016 technology
licensing deal it struck with China come
well well come to an end as Lisa suit
confirmed with Tom's Hardware last week
China will still be able to develop
chips based on Andy's first generation
of Zen and this encompasses Rison and
epic Naples as well
however Andy will not extend its more
recent x86 IP including the recent Zen
to architecture and Rome to to China for
the licensee this was known as the
Tianjin higuaín advanced technology
invents investments Company Limited go
figure it's the English word I'd screw
up on deal between AMD and China serves
as both a path to the lucrative Chinese
market for Andy and a chance for China
to develop its own x86 technology
regarding the future of this group Lisa
sue stated quote we are not discussing
any additional technology transfers and
said that this was a single generation
technology license and there are no
additional technology licenses on to
Intel quote x4 99 news few things here
so X 499 a n X 499 motherboard in quotes
was shown at Computex we spoke to
gigabyte about this so this first was
brought to my attention when we were on
with PC world on one of their videos and
Gordon mentioned to me on camera
did you see the gigabyte X 499 leaked
and do you think it was real leaked so
the story as it goes was that there was
a sticker on top of the the name and
someone peeled it off and gotcha they
they caught gigabyte and it's an export
night and Ford to disappoint everyone
that was not an X $4.99 board so a few
things here one of them come
do this a lot motherboard manufacturers
start developing their product before
the chips that's available to them and
we've seen this we've seen it with X 578
470 and even 370 and when I say we I
mean sometimes us exclusively without
the ability to publish it and sometimes
we've been able to publish it even as
much as looking at the motherboards on
camera but what is often not allowed in
those circumstances is the removal of a
chipset heatsink and that's because
although the board might be ready like
the PCB in the vrm or partially ready
and although the name of the board might
be ready and printed on to the
engineering sample there's not actually
that chipset on it so again x5 74 73 70
even Z 390 C 370z to set basically every
board we've ever reported on where we
got to see it in advance whether we
could tell you about it or not they did
not have the chips that's on them when
it was far enough in advance that the
launch was still several months away so
they were engineering boards often with
the older chipset for testing and
validation purposes now raises the
question is it still an x5 70 board then
is it still an X 499 board then well the
answer is no it's not but it might
eventually be one the question in this
instance though expands to will it ever
be X 499 or is it just going to stay X
299 and this is where we can read some
of the statement that I got from
gigabyte which we've already published
on our YouTube community page but we'll
go through it here here's what we've
posted on the YouTube community page we
said we asked gigabyte about that X 499
motherboard spotted at Computex 2019
when we talked about in the video on PC
world and gigabyte officially confirmed
to GM that the board is X 299 the
chipset is the same as two years ago and
the sticker is a mix up or a mistake X
499 doesn't presently exist as a chip
set we went on to say it might close er
to launch but that board didn't have it
that's a placeholder gigabyte might call
that board and probably will X 299 G to
differentiate the newer SKUs but it's
the same X 299 ships head-on that
convention show board and just we just
wanted to follow up with gigabyte
officially now we've spoken to some more
people since then and our understanding
is that it will remain X 299 G is
gigabyte thing gigabyte decided to add
the G to the end of X $2.99 that is not
Intel gigabyte does it to differentiate
the newer or the refresh SKUs versus the
older ones as we understand it Intel has
no current plans to release a new X
$4.99 chipset that could change but if
they do there probably won't be massive
changes to the chips I will see that
part we're a little uncertain on what we
are absolutely certain on is the board
at Computex was not X $4.99 it was X
$2.99 g as gigabyte calls it but X $2.99
anyway probably not going to be an
export native 9 chipset for the update
Glacier Falls I think they call it later
this year but that's what we know so X
49 unfortunately not actually at the
show is something that a little insight
information for you though a lot of the
times the boards that say they have a
new chipset if it's like the only one
you've seen from a show like that one
they don't actually have a new chipset
they're just named that and then the
real trick is was the person showing it
able to with or without the company
knowing remove the chipset heatsink and
if they did take a good look at the
chipset and see if it physically looks
different than the previous models or if
it's got a laser etched a name in it
then even easier and that may tell you
if it's actually the new chipset or not
that's not just this launch that's all
of them going forward keep that in mind
move it on Windows Patch blue keep and
the exploit and then Windows 10 getting
variable refresh rate toggles in the OS
not long ago we reported on a wearable
exploit that warranted enough caution
from Microsoft to deliver a critical
update to the ancient Windows XP the
exploit has since earned the name blue
keep and Microsoft has doubled down on
its warning to update and patch almost
all Windows versions even the NSA has
added its voice to the chorus quotes the
National Security Agency is urging
Microsoft Windows administrators and
users to ensure they are using a patch
and updated system in the face of
growing threats recent warnings by
Microsoft stressed the importance of
installing patches to address the
protocol vulnerability and older
versions of Windows they went on to say
that this is a were mobile flaw that
could be fixed so TLDR update Windows
it's that it actually
matters this time and then finally and
we'll keep this one short because we're
running lon
the may 20 19 steam hardware survey
shows RT acts as a slow burner
despite the aspiring competition in the
epic game store steam is the for most PC
gaming platform still and its new a PC
hardware survey shows some information
on RT X the most notable observations
that RT acts at card adoption rate is on
the rise slowly but surely the install
base for Nvidia's RT X cards rose
roughly is 0.31% between April and May
with the RTS 2060 accounting for the
bulk of that growth unsurprisingly and
videos 1060 and 1050 I still remain the
most popular cards outside of GPUs most
gamers are still using quad-core CPUs
with hexa core and octa core processors
being a distant second and third place
Windows 10 is still the OS of choice and
1920 by 1080 is still the most dominant
resolution for the majority of gamers on
the platform so that will cap our news
