looking at the X 299 borders there's no
399 yet
we'll have it soon but for today we're
focusing on jus 99 so the boards to look
at this is the flagship this is the X
our board we have the specs on the BRM
they're using all IR we'll go through
that the m7 the Pro carbon tomahawk and
then finally the sy+ board before we get
into that this coverage is brought to
you by Corsair and their vengeance RGB
LED memory the ICS on the Vengeance
memory are sort of pre selected for
overclocking so check the link in the
description below for more on that let's
start the flagship so a few things here
we'll get to them to shields in a minute
we had to talk about that but before
getting to that for the power components
they're using all ir35 2:01 controllers
for the voltage controller for vcore i
don't know the mosfet yet but we have
the basics for the components that's all
I are so that is a bit of a trend right
now with X 299 we start with gigabyte
and we saw it with EVGA as well aside
from that the normal assortment of armor
and things like that are on the board
but for things that are actually
interesting they're running an X 16 X 16
and I believe an X 8 X 8 for the other
two PCIe slots that will have
clarifications in the article in the
link in the description below for the
m-dot two shields there's new one here
this is called frozer so this actually
latches will have some b-roll of it
latches in here and the frozer one has a
it's an aluminum heatsink I'm told we
haven't really obviously had time to
cast yet but aluminum heatsink there is
a three millimeters thick they're all
pad on the underside of it not presence
in our b-roll because of trade show
three millimeters thick heat pad or
thermal pad and they've improved the
thermal conductivity of had I don't know
the specifics that same pad is supposed
to be on these as well the difference
between these in the previous model that
we looked at on the gaming Pro carbon is
just that screw and the thermal pad so
this screws a bit better than we worked
with before small thing but it's the
small things that matter with
motherboards ultimately so that's the
changes there we talked about airflow
and problems like that we'll have to
test it more but hopefully that helps
out
there's no sinking to a PCB or anything
like that like EVGA is doing so it's
just of this heatsink alone this is just
LED chipset cover led LED and I'm moving
on to the m7 board by the way nope no
price for any of these m7 board there's
digital LEDs here leds leds leds
obviously this PCIe configurations a
little bit different so it's x16 there
to x16 there's an X 4 and X 8 I believe
and we'll post correction in the
comments if not other than that this m2
shield is a little bit different from
the previous two it still got the
mechanical action to it it's got the
three millimeter thick their home pad
which we can show on b-roll and just
closes just like that on top of the
devices we've already got a whole
content piece on that in the past so if
you're curious you can learn more there
other than this buttons on the board
include go down to just power and the
overclocking dial right here the other
board has voltage plus and minus buttons
as well so this one steps down a bit
strip some of the features away to lower
the price next or actually for erm
phases
this one is an 8 + 2 that's a 12 + 2 and
then the rest are all a plus 1 so April
20 + 20 + 1 they're all ir35 to 0 1 both
controllers and all IR MOSFETs so that's
that board covered the next one is the
gaming pro carbon this board primarily
focuses on things like RGB LEDs it is
more of a gamer targeted board unless 7x
to 99 enthusiasts h EDT type board so
this is something that makes more sense
maybe for your cable a Cox refresh or
something like that although you still
have 4 dims that you won't be able to
use this table a classic X so that one
it's pretty much RGB LEDs the tomahawk
is one of the cheapest boards 4x 299
it's always their lower cost model the
color scheme changes a little bit goes
to gray and black whereas these others
are silver or black and black and it
simplifies things like you lose the
memory armor and you keep some of the
PCI armor on the x16 slots whereas the
other ones lose it and that's really all
there is there this is another m2 shield
we don't know the specifics on this
particular model though the last one 4x
299 is a slightly plus model this is
normally like a mid-range type board no
prices again LEDs simplified here this
one - no LEDs that we can see right now
led led and to our thoughts no Armour
it's an eight plus one phase design so a
little bit cheaper to produce the vrm
than the previous boards and I think
that pretty much wraps up the
motherboards for the MSI booth so that's
all the X 299 boards as always you can
find more information in the description
below I've got a whole lot of notes that
we took here with engineers and p.m. but
we'll detail all that stuff in the
article of you're curious about more you
know patreon.com slash gamers next comes
out directly and as always subscribe for
more thanks for watching I'll see you
all next time
