donna and we are doing another episode
of ask GN i think we might be on five
now so going pretty well definitely keep
posting your questions about computer
hardware and video games as they pertain
to computer hardware in the comments
below and we'll keep addressing those in
the videos definitely some fun stuff
comes out of it so first off there were
a few questions about multi monitors in
the previous video and i did see them i
did read them and i do want to address
them but i need to do a bit of studying
on some of the aspects of the questions
to make sure everything is completely
sound when i'm addressing them so i will
not be answering those in this video but
i did see them and i do want to talk
about it things i can talk about include
DirectX 12 so let's just dive into that
right away the first question today was
from nishant shook area sorry you said
thank you for the response the previous
question another question I have is
about multi-gpu in directx 12 some
people are saying that with dx12 you can
sli or crossfire and NVIDIA GPU with an
AMD GPU in a single PC triple ! is it
really true or are these baseless rumors
so they're not baseless rumors whether
or not it's true sort of depends on your
definition of true and how things play
out as the API matures and things like
that so in theory it is possible to have
both an AMD and NVIDIA GPU in the same
system with directx 12 and theoretically
even utilize both of those video cards
for your game processing there are a lot
of problems here one of them includes
the difference of requirement for what
constitutes a multi-gpu configuration by
AMD and nvidia and video for instance
currently uses an sli bridge and the no
longer uses the crossfire bridge they've
gotten rid of that and they go through
the PCIe interface so that certainly
complicates things but more so than that
it's just the fact that you would need
software to actually developed for such
a configuration and tested for it it's
pretty unlikely that those
configurations will exist at least as it
stands in the market today so games
about
purrs won't be tuning or optimizing or
testing for those really at all which
does impact the viability of that setup
it also means that you'll need things
like drivers and engines to be built for
such a configuration two things that I
also don't suspect will be happening in
the current market so they are not
baseless rumors it is something that
theoretically can be done but the impact
in the gaming environment will be
probably minimal at least at the
beginning because nothing's going to be
built for it so I certainly would not
plan on coupling and Andy and an Nvidia
video card in the same system for your
next build it's not something I would
plan on but it's definitely cool and
we'll be testing it as dx12 matures and
things like that so good question there
excuse me next one is from Andre who
says how about plugging in oh sorry this
is about the grounding cable so I
recently posted a video about how to
make a grounding cable to ground
yourself meaning take all these static
electricity out of your system before
building a pc and the sister protect
your components from ESD or
electrostatic discharge that known Andre
here commented on that video and asked
how about plugging in the power supply
with the switch on it turned to off and
then touching it before you touch your
hardware I heard this work too is this
correct so it is correct ESD is a tricky
thing to deal with because a lot of
people will just sort of tap their case
as their building and hope that that's
enough the thing is here the case is not
necessarily directly attached to align
to ground and it's also going to be
painted metal unless you're working with
something like raw aluminum from Lian Li
or something so when you're working with
any kind of painted metal that is a much
less conductive surface so even if
you're carrying a charge you might not
necessarily omit that charge to the
piece of metal you're touching and you
want to direct path to ground somewhere
in the system with the grounding cable
that I show you how to make in the video
you are plugging into the third prong
and US outlets it's different
countries but in u.s. outlets it's the
third prong its cylindrical you plug
into that tap the wire that's exposed
and then that'll ground you through the
ground socket or the ground pen in the
wall socket now hopefully the wall
socket has actually been wired to ground
some one of the viewers commented and
said that in his apartment or his
building or whatever the ground pin and
the wall sockets was not actually
connected to earth so wouldn't work in
that case which is a problem but when
you're looking at touching the power
supply what you can do and this is what
I've done in a pinch is take the
alligator clip from your ESD or your
anti-static wrist strap those yellow
ones you wear and clip the alligator
clip to the fan grill of the power
supply this will normally be painted
metal so keep that in mind it's the same
issue but it's much more likely to work
and you need to connect the power supply
to the outlet and then you can just
toggle the switch off so you just turn
the switch off just for safety so you
don't damage components by actually
toggling power and sending power through
the system when it's not ready but I
toggle the switch off plug it in connect
to the grill or something that you can
grab with the alligator clip or really
if you can touch it to that works but
it's not something I like doing if I'm
working with expensive components and I
have killed components with ESD and
that'll get you by if you don't want to
do like a grounding cable or something
more complex so yes that is the answer
is that that is correct you heard
correctly next question let's go Iowa
said it's a very enthusiastic way to
talk about Iowa I must say says hey
Steve how likely is a Vulcan adoption
compared to dx12 and how did the API is
differ so both of these questions I will
be addressing an interview with chris
Roberts tomorrow he's the guy working on
star citizen there are a lot of people
working on star citizen but he's the the
main deal so chris Roberts will be
talking with me about Vulcan directx 12
and how they compare the feature levels
and the applicability
you to his game but of course the the
greater market as well for those of you
who have seen the chris Roberts videos
I've done you know how they go it sort
of just gets deeper and deeper into the
discussion which is awesome so we're
going to be talking about that but to
quickly address this volkan adoption
faces a few challenges the main ones are
that Microsoft is a big company and
microsoft owns DirectX volkan is a
spin-off of OpenGL and mantle so it's so
it's building on an existing API feature
set it has a very similar feature set to
dx12 and in theory it's more open well
it is more open there's no theory about
it and that's just because the way it's
built so the thing here is that Nvidia
and Microsoft's are both pushing Direct
X 12 pretty hard especially Microsoft
and that's going to be a challenge
because of the way the industry works
with the game developers the game
developers are ultimately who will
dictate which API stays and which one is
stays in a smaller capacity basically so
as long as that exists there's a problem
with uptake on Vulcan and then there
were rumors a while back about Andy
being acquired by Microsoft's there's
presently no data to support those
rumors but theoretically if something
like that were to happen then it would
also impact the Vulcan adoption if
microsoft acquired andy that i say it's
all the way a second ago I may have said
it backwards which is not going to
happen if I said am the acquiring
Microsoft the rumor was that Microsoft
would acquire handy and if that happens
which no base to that if it does that
will in my opinion potentially torpedo
Vulcan very early in the process that
would be a challenge as well feature
sets pretty similar but we haven't
really seen Vulcan in action yet and
Direct X 12 is only just now rolling so
something I'm gonna be talking more with
Chris about tomorrow and we'll publish
the video hopefully over the weekend so
that's what I have to say about that
Alex Maya says is there a way I can
correlate a fan speed that is connected
to a PWM header which
for those who don't know means pulse
width modulation that means that the fan
is controllable through the fourth pen
on the fan header and he says can I
correlate the pwm fan header on my
motherboard to the GPU temperature the
answer is yes so you can use something
like msi afterburner EVGA precision i
think asus has some kind of utility as
well you can use one of those and build
a custom fan curve the one I'm most
familiar with is msi afterburner you
open the fan control and the the
advanced settings or wherever it is and
you just drag points along a graph that
have I believe its temperature on the
temperature on the x-axis and then fan
percentage speed on the y-axis so if you
want to say keep lower fan rpms until
you hit a more dangerous temperature
like 80 Celsius 85 celsius then you can
build a curve that ramps the RPM almost
not at all or very slowly at the lower
thermals and then once it hits a really
high thermal you can spike your rpm if
you're someone who's more concerned
about consistency smoothness then you'll
want to do a more gradual fan curve
because this will impact how noisy it is
perceived to you as a user so although a
higher rpm will certainly be very loud
the annoying thing to a lot of people
who demand silence in a PC is actually
the the difference between the time of
the fan moves from one rpm to the next
so in that case you'll want to build a
smoother van curve that way more
gradually increments and you are less
likely to suddenly notice something in
your ear as you're trying to play a game
but yes you can control that and you
should set up custom fan curb because
it's pretty cool and it's a useful thing
to do the dell give the dell catacomb
sorry says that as GN is there a shadow
play equivalent on The Andy side if not
is there any low performance hit screen
recorders yes there is an AMD equivalent
and it is called GV r it is made by
Raptor Raptor hired the Radeon pro guys
to help work on it
and DVR is something we've tested you
can search the channel for shadow play
or GV r or fraps if you search any of
those three things you'll find the video
i did and GPR has improved a bit since
then but it is a much lower impact on
something like fraps which just eats CPU
it really doesn't do anything with GP
parallelization which is a big problem
for perhaps so GPR is more similar to
shadow play ggrr is also compatible with
nvidia devices I there's no real reason
you would use it over shadow play
especially because the performance Delta
is a little bit worse when using GV r
but it's possible and I guess there's a
really reason to use it the real reason
would be if you don't have a device that
supports shadow play but you have an
nvidia device like something that's not
on Kepler Maxwell something maybe Fermi
for example a 400 series video card so
that's how that works gbr I can't
remember I without my head how big the
impact was but that video will tell you
and I know that shadow play had an
impact of between two and four percent
to your FPS so it eats about two to four
percent to do that in code and that's
because it goes on to a separate h.264
encoder on the GPU die on the chip GPU
or GPR rather does a similar thing it
uses and these on chip encoder so very
similar technology similarly low impact
but it did have a bit more impact in
some places than others where we're in
video is more consistent but it's it's
something i would recommend if you want
to do screen capture without using fraps
so that is the solution there those are
the really shadowplay GPR are the best
items there are other screen recorders
I'm sure a few of you know them if you
do post them below cuz I'm curious I'm
not too familiar with recorders outside
of those two I know there's hypercam
there's Camtasia or stuff like that but
I don't know that they're GPU
accelerated and I know hyper cams not
great for Game Capture so that's for my
knowledge is on that check back soon for
the chris Roberts interview all the
other stuff this video might actually go
up after I interview him interviews on
friday this week so this video might go
up like a day after that but either way
check back for it check back for all the
other stuff and thank you to the now 15
patrons we have on patreon it is a
huge help to see you guys supporting the
content director like that I am
sincerely appreciative and it's
encouraging because hopefully it helps
us upgrade some of our equipment here
I've ordered I have a new chair she
can't see from this camera angle really
but we have two of these we have a table
so it's a living large gear and those
will be used for multi-person video
casts which I'm actually really excited
about getting at least one other person
involved so we can talk hardware or
games or whatever do sort of a
roundtable discussion there we've got a
set well that's coming into so this is a
great sheet as you would put on your bed
but we're ordering a wood wall that's
paneling and going to build it it'll
look really cool pretty excited about
that and I'm ordering two new light so
we get rid of this shadow in right here
that's some of you have commented on so
things are exciting right now and a lot
of that's because of the support from
just viewing and commenting and of
course the direct support from patreon
check all that out in the postural video
thanks again for watching let me know
what your next questions are for the
next video and I'll see you all next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
