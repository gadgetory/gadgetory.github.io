news episode this one we're talking
about ddr5 coming up actually they're a
couple of functional demos now DDR 540
400 megahertz memory looking at 6000
plus megahertz for the future of that
one then we'll also be talking about
Intel and AMD having some naming
annoyances with their chipsets because
apparently that's how childish the
industry has become that we need to just
name things in anticipation of the
competing product names in the future so
we talk about that for a little bit as
well before that this video is brought
to you by thermal takes view 37 case the
view 37 focuses on highlighting custom
PC builds with its full panoramic window
and tinted front acrylic and our thermal
testing the view 37 performed reasonably
well when considering its looks focused
build which is partly thanks to the
airflow design and the removal of a
bottom power supply shroud for a balance
of looks and performance check the link
in the description below for the view 37
first up the big news item which is DDR
5 micron worked with cadence
to demonstrate new ddr5 memory just
recently and that was using a cadence
test chip and IMC that will be jointly
targeted at SOC manufacturers for ddr 5
preparation these are people who will be
developers not consumers the ddr 5
demonstrations started with 40 400
megahertz memory that was at CL 42
that's right CL 42 it was for 8
gigabytes of memory operating that 100
millivolts lower than ddr4 ISM low and
voltage micron is targeting an eventual
60 400 megahertz frequency but the
immediate future is in the 4 thousands
for frequency micron and cadence both
noted that ddr5 presently is more of a
capacity play than it is a performance
play so ddr5 is looking at increasing
the density to 16 and 32 gigabit dies
with internal ECC supported for people
who need it and that overall the yields
should be improved according to the two
companies DDR fives also meant to stick
to the 288 pins standard of ddr4 that
we're currently using for the pin out
and adding other new features like
built-in voltage regulators and power
management surrogates will also be
interesting though
presently sure how much of that will be
consumer-facing versus enterprise and
server we don't know much more than what
JEDEC has said and what micron and
cadence showed up the recent
demonstration but an attack has a great
article detailing the initial showing
and cadence predicts that ddr5 will
overtake ddr4 by 2022 quick note here
the CL 42 thing this is a super early
demo they'll probably be tightened a bit
by launch but also if you go back and
look at the era of ddr3 - ddr4 you'll
notice that ddr3 had tighter times than
ddr4 as well so that's the nature of
increasing speeds especially when you're
focusing on things like capacity with
the er5 so we'll see how that develops
but for now we've got the first
functional demo it looks like that's
actually looking kind of promising so
ddr5 going places and we'll see if
they're predicting 20 22 for mass
adoption not sure if that's server data
center or if it's consumer as well but
you could expect platforms would support
it obviously before then next one AMD
and Intel naming lunacy so we already
know that Intel's working on is e3 90
platform we've known that for a while it
looks like Andy is also working on its
own Z series platform something that
hasn't had any time in recent history at
least not with Verizon and that's gonna
be called z4 90 which is exactly 100
digits higher than Intel's and that's
looking to launch in June of July we're
not positive what z4 90 will bring to
the table from AMD we just know that it
will exist and we've independently
confirmed that so the leaks from blue
chip with distribution partner look to
be legitimate we have a roadmap from
blue chip that shows Intel's the first
eight core engineering samples due for
June according to the leaked and Intel's
it Z 390 platform targeted for third
quarter 2018 the engineering samples
obviously predate the retail samples so
we're looking at third quarter for eight
core CPUs to ship on Z 390 and Andy's be
450 lower-end platform will be shipping
in July to August of this year likely
with a few units showing behind closed
doors at Computex if not publicly thread
referred to is also known for August and
was already publicly known for that date
and that's still on track so here's
where the annoying
part comes in you talk about GPP and
needing clarity for gamers you know what
could actually use a GPP motherboards
and motherboard vendors so here we've
got B 250 this is Intel we have B 350
this was AMD Rison and clearly was a
sort of job at Intel maybe take over
some of them it kind of makes sense
because Andy was the underdog coming in
with Rison and so to build on top of ins
house known and understood naming meant
that Andy had fewer walls to break down
when they're trying to get to new
consumers so that's part of it then you
have stuff like be 360 which is Intel I
had to look at the Box can't keep them
straight anymore and now we've got B 450
coming out and some other stuff too so
the problem I have with this is like I
get it Andy came in trying to get it
trying to take some of the recognition
that Intel had in terms of people
understand it what the product is so
they had r3 r5 r7 pretty clear what
those are if you understand Intel's
naming scheme makes a lot of sense I'm
pretty much okay with that I would have
liked something like R 4 R 6 r 8 because
that would be the core count of each of
those things for the most part - the
1500 X but that's how we got we got an
Intel equivalent naming that's fine what
I've got more problems with is the
ongoing chipset naming equivalents Intel
doesn't want to budge probably because
they're like we did this first and Andy
is just keeping with what they started
with Rison so now we've got chipsets
that in the worst cases our 10 digits
apart and name or in normal cases 100
digits apart name because I am thieves
are trying to be a hundred higher than
Intel and therefore be better I guess
they also do the whole frontier edition
versus founders Edition thing but it's
it's annoying it's annoying as a
reviewer even we work with this stuff
every day and when writing stuff we
still have to go back and double-check
that we say beet 360 or B 350 and it's
kind of hard to keep track of as
reviewers even especially with the stuff
coming up see
see 490 be 450 all that stuff so for
consumers especially those who aren't
like you all people who come back once
every three years to build the system
it's gonna get really confusing really
fast and I think Andy if built up a lot
of good good will with Rison it's
clearly a part that's highly competitive
and should do well and is doing well
maybe it's time to take your own naming
do something unique or or I don't know
even in tell I guess create something
new but if we could just stop copying
each other like children that would be
great either one of you just just one
vendor please do something different for
the naming it's gotten a bit crazy
next one speaking of things that are
annoying cami Lake acts Kimmy the hex
was the worst received CP that we
reviewed last year it's the one that I
tossed on the table and that one intel
has announced the end of life status for
Katie like axe which i think is less
than a year old it was good for a few
things it was good for memory
overclocking they had pretty strong
IMC's the engineering samples especially
they were okay for overclocking and when
I say that I mean competitive
overclocking as a consumer part
completely utterly pointless and
wasteful and no one should have bought
them and apparently no one did because
they've killed them so the i5 7640 axe
which is probably the stupidest part and
the IEEE 777 for TX both four core parts
that made up the low end of Intel's X
299 compatible h EDT line those are now
dead and they're relatively low value
anyway given X 2 99 requires a much more
premium motherboard generally and no
vendors were catering to those cable ax
parts anyway also a thread ripper took
away some of the thunder from the
low-end h EDT parts anyway so yeah
there's a dead now that's good news
let's move on to the next one
Intel using China factories for
additional coffee lake assembly and
testing intel announced that they'll be
using facilities in china as a test and
assemble the core i5 and i7 coffee like
cpus intel says this will allow them to
further increase supply of the six core
coffee like variants starting in May
consumers can expect to see
like CPUs that is i7 8700 K 8780 600 K
580 400 on the market that have been
tested and assembled in Chengdu China
intelligence that all procedures and
production methods are the same across
the global production facilities next
one the specter intensifies hisin
magazine let me get the name right C
apostrophe T please sure that's how it's
pronounced C apostrophe T released a
report that suggested a new set of
Spector vulnerabilities looming
presently known as Spectre and G and T L
responded to the report via its blog and
directly responded and stated that the
company is working closely with partners
and everyone else in the industry chip
makers noted specifically to understand
the vulnerabilities and attack vectors
for the new Spectre variants the company
recommended keeping systems up-to-date
for safety for the time being and has
announced no additional information on
Spectre ng the C apostrophe T
publication got ahead of any official
NDA lifts kind of like what happened
previously and highlighted that 8cv e or
common vulnerability enumerator attacks
are in need of standalone patches some
of which are coming up in May from Intel
so they're already ahead of this a bit
the magazine claims that Intel is
already working on two rounds of patches
again targeted for May and C posture PT
lightly detailed an attack that could
affect cloud server hosts similar to
meltdown which would be exploited via VM
host attack vectors arm and Intel are
most possibly affected and AMD might be
AMD is affected by one existing Spectre
attack variant that we know of but
there's nothing concrete either way on
the current documentation for the new
Spectre attack factors this one's sort
of interesting bike ski bike sky
whatever introduced two new water
cooling components this week both of
which are inline thermal monitors for
open-loop liquid cooling the components
mount to the fittings and use an inline
thermistor at water inlet for monitoring
as of now it doesn't look like there's a
way to export the state of the software
unfortunately and it appears limited to
on device readings bikes guy also
released a real-time thermal monitor for
video cards named the B VGA SCAL
complementing the tme
and it works the same way the materials
are anodized aluminum materials
including marketing and silliness about
being aircraft grade aluminum hopefully
they're also made with aircraft grade
discomfort from the awful marketing the
units are priced at forty to fifty
dollars for each of them Corsair
announced the new spec oh five case this
week
so that's it just like most the other
cases in the world right now as a
largely closed off front panel it's got
some side intake and a weird sort of
artsy wannabe cut in the front of it
that should let some amount of air
through I guess we'd like to see that
front slit wide end more so that can let
more air in kind of like the one that we
Emily showed at CES not the dynamic or
the Oh 11 but the other case because
that would at least get you some
functional amount of air through there
and still be kind of a design element
but for now it's another limited airflow
case this one has an acrylic window
though it's at $50 so at least it's
affordable the next story is an
interesting one from just the industry
in general and a waste recycler
undercutting Microsoft is being sued and
it looks like sentenced to a 15 month
prison term and a $50,000 fine for the
alleged infringement of Microsoft's
products and profits by attempting to
resell restore discs Eric Lundgren made
28 thousand of the discs and intended
selling these repair discs to computer
refurbishers for about 25 cents apiece
according to Microsoft this is copyright
infringement and counterfeits traffic
Microsoft asserts that while software
licenses are transferable commercial
resellers must purchase a new license
for $25 not 25 cents also of note Eric
Lundgren the one who was sued and has
been sentenced seemed to indicate that
he didn't think anyone in the courtroom
understood what a repair disk was
probably realistic so lankan argued that
his discs had no value to Microsoft or
anyone else and that they were only
intended to be used to restore systems
with an existing OS license the idea
being that it limits the amount of
people throwing they're decent computers
away from a hardware perspective because
they need to restore their software
because they had a virus or whatever
this is for people who go to repair
shops not anyone who watches this
channel for the most part so the court
concluded that Lundgren's 28,000 discs
were worth $700,000 he paid fewer than
five cents apiece for them and that
amount warrants apparently a 15 month
prison stay and 50,000 dollars in fines
a lawyer for Microsoft alleges that the
sales of quote
fit operating systems displaces
Microsoft's potential sales of genuine
operating systems long granted his
attorney said that the court has set a
precedent for Microsoft and other
software makers to pursue criminal cases
against those seeking to tackle a waste
and extend the lifespan of computers
kind of falls into the right to repair
bucket for that one and then finally
also leave your thoughts below on that
I'll kind of leave mine out and just see
what you all think hardware sales for
the week the r7 1700 is looking really
good right now that's 220 to 250 dollars
the pen out if you look at New Ager
Amazon will put links in the description
below for that sale at that price it's
worth buying it over the 2000 series our
sevens if you're kind of budget
conscious because we do really like the
r7 1700 mostly if you overclock it if
you're willing to overclock it to 3.9 or
4.0 it's an incredibly competitive
processor primarily in production it
does well enough in gaming at this price
point to be worth a buy so we'll leave a
link down there for that an EVGA
supernova 650 Jiwon fully modular power
supply is also currently marked down 17%
at time of filming
we'll leave a link for that one as well
if you're looking for a new power supply
in the 650 watt range that's all for
this one as always subscribe for more go
