as always you can leave your questions
for next time in the comment section
below or if you're a patreon Bagri you
can post them in the ask GN patreon chat
channel or if you also want the extra
version of ask GN after this with just a
couple of the extra patreon questions
you can support us on patreon where
we'll distribute the second additional
episode for sgn for this week so this
one we've got a couple good questions
there were quite a few people asking
about X 370 versus X 470 testing for
risin plus or risin to depend on what
you want to call it so when we talk
about that I've got a couple of other
good ones like how do you balance
criticism and not leave manufacturers
mad for example is definitely worth
talking about so we'll go through those
for this week's episode before that this
video is brought to you by thermal
Grizzly makers of the conductor hot
liquid metal that we recently used to
drop 20 degrees off of our coffee leak
temperatures
thermal grizzly also makes traditional
thermal compounds we use on top of the
IHS like cryo not and hydro not pastes
learn more at the link below first
question is about X 370 versus X 470 so
this was asked in couple places patreon
most recently the discord is where I saw
it posted and just to kind of address
this early first of all yes we do have
and have had a risin - or 2000 series or
risin + chip whatever you want to call
it we are technically not under the
embargo for that CPU because we sampled
it through other channels not through
AMD however we are planning to launch
our review at the same time as embargo
lifts with all the other reviews so I'm
not gonna go to detailed even though
technically I could but what I will do
is address the basic question of are you
testing ax 370 versus X 470 the answer
is yes we already have and will present
that data when when the embargo lifts
even though technically we don't have to
but out of respect for other media will
do it for this one so actually Sony
where's 470 then I suppose the the main
question is whether the platform change
improves performance 1 for the previous
rise in CBS and 2
for the new ones coming up because you
could run them interchangeably on either
platform and the answer is it kind of
depends so without going into that all
the test data and stuff right now the
part where it depends is that if the
motherboards are perfectly identical
which we don't have two that are
perfectly identical outside of the
chipset it'd be easier to test
but because motherboards tuned the lower
unseen memory timings differently
because there are other changes and how
these socket behaves in terms of how
much power it's pushing to the CPU
current limits power limits things like
that that are all under the surface it's
a little harder to neutralize all the
variables and tests and see is there
just an outright difference a versus B
there is a difference sometimes it's not
what you would expect but we're still
looking into it and a lot of this comes
down to things like does the vendor for
the motherboard you're using for the EFI
version they have does the vendor force
xfr to on by default the upgraded
version of extended frequency range or
XFR Verizon do they force that on by
default do they force what power
settings do they enforce for the CPU
what kind of power limits do they have
in place so these things impact the
performance more than just a straight
chipset change but we're doing our best
to isolate all the variables and look at
it for you that said you can't isolate
all of them and ultimately at some point
you are looking at differences that are
almost more between the UEFI tuning than
they are between just the chipset alone
other than that there aren't too many
chips that changes honestly we'll talk
about that more later but there are
definitely BIOS level changes from the
vendors they've all kind of done some
extra tuning they've had more time to
allow Rison to mature actually 70
matured so x4 70 is looking a bit better
things are stable on both platforms for
us right now we haven't had any blue
screens or severe crashes or defects or
anything bad like that so that's
encouraging to see but we'll clue you in
on all the performance when we decide to
post it which as I said will be
basically in line with all the
reviews we're mostly gonna follow that
that embargo even though we don't have
to but yeah subscribe to make sure you
catch that answer the question though
yes we are testing them we have tested
them
we'll have data for you when the review
goes live so next one is from TJ CCB
r-47 who said ask GN how to balance
criticism and not leave manufacturers
mad you lost coolermaster samples hard
OCP lost on video samples guru 3d lost
intel samples do you think it's fair not
receiving samples or is it some kind of
censorship this is a really good
question it's kind of complicated but
I'll condense it as best I can
the last ones the easiest do you think
it's fair not receiving samples or some
kind of censorship it's fair to not
receive samples we're not entitled to
samples we're not entitled to free
product review we're not entitled to
loaner products to review if they don't
want to send it that's completely within
their rights it's not censorship at the
end of the day it's our job in media to
if we feel like they're trying to censor
us or to use your word censor us or if
they're trying to prevent us from
reviewing a product that for some reason
would be received poorly by us it's our
job at some level to go buy it which
we've done in the past I think we made a
pretty big statement to everyone when we
bought a Titan V I think that pretty
much shows the extent were willing to go
to now it's not always possible to buy
samples and this also gets into a bigger
a greater discussion of of launch timing
because if companies cut you out of the
review cycle because you've criticized
them for some reason the the bigger
impact isn't that you're not getting the
product because most of the outlets if
they had to could buy these things the
bigger issue is that you might not be
able to get it before launch so we can
try and work with third parties with
partners we have in the industry people
we've known a long time to try and get
something ahead of launch through an
unofficial channel it doesn't always
work out they often don't have the stuff
that early either or have limited
quantities so worst case scenario like
with H 500 P mash we have to buy it when
everyone else does and basically the
same day or next day ship it
and then get the review up ASAP so in
doing that yes we were able to get the
product we're able to review it we
bypass any attempts at cutting us from
the review process but we do miss that
critical launched a window so each 500 B
mesh I think we I mean just kind of
based on experience I think we would
have done about 30,000 more views if we
posted it on launch day as opposed to a
couple days later just to give you an
idea so that is something that you feel
an impact from as a media outlet
fortunately as our channel and as other
channels grow and you develop a
following that trusts you some of that
loss of initial views from a day one
posting being missed is made up for just
by having a really strong core audience
that supports you and in our case will
come and watch the H 500 PMS review for
example even days after its launch just
because people want to see what we had
to say about it so there there is some
give-and-take there's definitely if a
vendor wants to punish you for saying
something critical which they often do
it kind of depends on which manufacturer
it is they all behave a bit differently
if they want to punish you for it
typically what happens is this they'll
often cut us or other people out from
the review cycle for one to two product
launches after that point you're pretty
much guaranteed that they'll either grow
up and get over it or the PR people may
have changed because PR people in the
industry change all the time it's kind
of a revolving door
someone at company a will be at Company
B next month and as long as your
relationship with the people is okay
then you can keep those the the product
sampling and relationships established
as they move companies even if you're
critical because if the people and they
often do understand why we're being
critical they'll do their best to
advocate for us getting samples and I
know some of the companies who've cut us
out of the cycle in the past I've done
that the PR people but it's often
headquarters that puts the foot down and
says now they're their meanies and we
don't like it so don't give them stuff
because that'll stop them but I write
that so that's that's kind of the first
half the question the rest of it how do
you balance
I mean to balance it we don't really
cover much Kingston stuff anymore but I
want to talk about Kingston so Kingston
was the first hardware company I really
worked with closely in a sampling
capacity in the industry Kingston and
Roseville and Kingston when I spoke with
their PR our main PR contact at the time
what he said to me when I asked a
similar question was just be fair just
just do your best to report on the
product in a fair capacity if you
encounter issues hopefully before launch
contact the company talk to them
establish is this my fault is it their
fault is it a third party's fault is it
Microsoft Windows being funny whatever
the issue is try to talk to them about
it and just make sure they're aware that
you have a problem and as long as it's
not something they can solve then yeah
of course criticize it or make an issue
of it or whatever as necessary but
giving people a heads up like that and
trying to work with them does a lot to
making sure you keep getting sampled
even if there's something critically
wrong because it shows that you're
willing to provide the opportunity for
them to correct one of your mistakes
mine in this case or to correct a
product mistake if it's before launch
and it's maybe a software issue they
could probably push an update out if
it's not too severe and get it fixed so
if you give them that opportunity and
don't blindside them on launch day then
often a lot of stuff can actually get
resolved and ultimately the goal is of
course
well it's theirs there are two goals for
us one is that the product should be as
good as it can be so if I can talk with
the manufacturer and improve it
indirectly before launch and the
customer buys it and they get the
improved version my job is basically
half done the next part of the job of
course is making sure they consumer is
getting something they actually need and
is quality so I guess the main thing I
learned from the conversations with that
PR rep and ages ago was if you're not
trying to trying to put a dent in their
armor and you're actually trying to work
with them on troubleshooting the issue
and establishing that it is an issue and
you explained why your views are what
they are
everything's pretty much okay we had a
phone call with coolermaster before our
age 500 P original review went live I
went over every single problem I had
with it and their answers were
unsatisfactory so that's why you saw the
review you saw but I think that that
answers a lot of it to recap here is it
fair to not get samples yes it's they
can do that if they want to
it might seem petty it kind of depends
on the situation but ultimately we know
that the companies will cycle back
through they'll come back eventually and
you know I'm fine with criticizing
samples and buying it myself I have to
because if I were doing this to get free
stuff all the time
then I what's the point I get a
different job has you got a look at why
you're doing it if you're in this
business to produce good content good
reviews that are critical and analytical
then do it there's no point in trying to
pander to the manufacturer to keep
getting free $100 cases or even $1,000
video cards because if you wanted to be
in this job for the money you're in
their own job might as well go work for
a manufacturer and make two to three
times as much money working half the
hours that's how I look at it so from
the perspective of integrity and having
it just be fair be critical of the
products if they deserve it and if the
consequence is that you don't get it in
the future that's fine
tell everyone you don't get in the
future and the manufacturer will receive
the reputation for cutting people off
from criticizing them and that will
eventually turn around and bite them so
that's I guess that's more or less how I
look at it you just get you have to as
an individual media outlet that is
obviously smaller than the manufacturers
you have to put your foot down and say
no this is bad and hit them on the nose
and tell them not to do it again and if
they'll give you one so be it I can
spend 150 bucks by okay
it's not a big deal and also there are
countless other products anyway that we
could review instead so you know just
the answer is be fair just be fair in
the criticism and everything should be
okay and if it's not then screw them and
buy it yourself
next one is from wraps up 100 who says
why doesn't AMD sell GPUs directly on
their site like Nvidia does
I think wraps up 100 spin around in
these ass jeans since one of the first
ones actually
why does so I think this is me kind of
speculating based on what I know of the
industry my kind of thoughts on that
would be Nvidia has a lot more leverage
than AMD over their partners look at the
GPB reports so from Nvidia's perspective
I what are you gonna do if Nvidia says
we're gonna start selling founders
edition cards and the partners are like
actually could you not do that what
leverage do you really have everyone who
makes Nvidia cards is just gonna pick up
your allocation if you don't have it
it's it's not like it won't advance the
partners to complain about it maybe if
they all got together and complained or
something I know but that's I guess how
how I would see it and videos got the
leverage to bypass their partners and
sell directly they don't seem to
undercut their partners too much there's
clearly still a lot of cards being made
by ACS EVGA everyone else but AMD
although they have basically mandated
that some of their past cards were a
specific design like the fury ax which
only ever had one officially permitted
design at launch anyway that could that
card was still sold by the partners even
though AMD made it but it was never sold
by Andy directly that I remember maybe
they've done it for one or two cards in
the past but I really don't remember
anything recently so I think it comes
down to leverage that would be my best
guess on it and and where you can apply
your leverage and what leverage you can
pull as the biggest of the two
manufacturers by large margin next one
is from Terence jell-o jell-o who says
is there a
cost difference to manufacturers between
free sync and gsync at a hardware or
software integration level
I see free sync integrated into a lot
more products and products with g-sync
seem to be more expensive I'm wondering
why NVIDIA is trying to widen their
market share with consumers but they're
not as successful as AMD when it comes
to providing incentives through
third-party accessories like monitors so
this is a good question we've talked
about before g-sync
is more expensive than freezing freezing
is not free to implement or even to sell
to the consumer but it's cheaper so
g-sync
has a two primary costs one of them is
the fpga board that's on the monitor so
they actually have a physical piece of
hardware that goes on the monitor it's
not necessarily cheap to make it that's
the G sync module so that and that's
what does the G sink processing on
Nvidia's version of an advanced to be
blank attribute under the is a
DisplayPort specification HDMI either
way it's a it's kind of like the V blank
attribute that's leveraged for freezing
and video will tell you it has a lot
more advanced functionality and that
it's smoother and things like that and
that pain for the board gets you a
higher quality that's their angle they
basically they say we make a higher
quality version of adaptive
synchronization by providing a physical
piece of hardware to do the processing
so that piece of hardware is what is
contributing to the cost and again note
I said Nvidia says that it's their
marketing on why there's why they think
theirs is better the other cost is
validation and this one applies to
freezing as well so freesync is
relatively free we had an interview ages
ago with Robert Halleck at AMD I think
it was either on camera or he was just
off-camera answering my questions and
when I asked him how free is free synced
to the vendor the bonner maker he said
well you still have validation cost but
other than that it's basically free so
yeah they do have to pay someone to test
it to validate it make sure it performs
to whatever spec they're saying it does
that has a cost but it's not a physical
piece of hardware so that's that's the
differences in terms
of why they why freesync is on monitors
is cheaper than g-sync effectively 100%
of the time and it's just no physical no
fpga board next question
Bandra mandragora's says what I'd love
to hear from you is explain how is it
possible that consoles with their weak
processors and weak GPUs can achieve
such amazing results according to what I
read on the internet I would expect an
FX 81 20 to be better than the Xbox one
s or ps4 is processor and the GP is to
have similar performance to a gtx 660ti
or 660ti accordingly
despite the console game is being
watered down and optimised why is it
impossible for equal or slightly better
PC components to handle the games the
same then goes on to talk about what
consoles lack in advanced graphics this
is a this is another good question that
we've talked about in the past but just
really briefly when it comes down to is
the consoles you have an Xbox one you
have a ps4 first of all both of those
consoles are on Jaguar architecture it's
kind of fortunate that they're both on
the same architecture it's an AMD
architecture for the CPU component so
they're both on the same or very similar
architecture and CPU fundamentals and
that makes it easy to optimize for both
of them secondly even with the one the
one asks all the other derivatives in
between ultimately when a developer
builds a game for the Xbox one or the
ps4 they are building their game for
functionally one set of hardware now
with the Refresh is there are some that
are slightly more powerful but it's the
same architecture at the end of the day
and typically the difference is 4k or
not so we can call it the same set of
hardware when you're building something
for one set of hardware it's a lot
easier you know what every customer has
so when you tune the game you build the
game it's gonna work the same on every
platform with PCs you have a million
variables there are games where we've
seen for example not long ago destiny 2
is a great example of one that affected
both and the N Nvidia both companies
released patches either around Bay
or launch that improves performance on
GP level with us with I think highest
settings at 1440p by upwards of 30
percent or more and that happens because
the developers didn't optimize the
shaders in a way that worked the best on
the hardware that was affected in this
case all of it because it was destiny's
here but with a console you don't really
expect stuff like that to get through
because you don't really generally give
settings customization at least not to a
level that would impact your validation
process for performance and you also
only have one piece of hardware to tune
for it so optimizing for shaders the
engineers the software developers really
don't have to know a whole lot about the
options out there because it's basically
one and and then I would assume on the
engineering side getting support from
Microsoft or Sony or whomever is also
going to be a bit more streamlined
because you again have one piece of
hardware to build for I would also
assume there's probably better
documentation for different rendering or
shader optimization techniques that can
be used for consoles that maybe don't
work on every piece of PC hardware and
that's why with some games you'll see
the game perform really well on a
particular set of AMD cards or
particular set of Nvidia cards but maybe
not they're older architectures because
they weren't tuned for because at some
point as a developer it all comes down
to time and money you run out of time
you run out of money and what are you
ultimately going to build for you're
going to build for the cards that are
the most popular
there were CPUs that are the most
popular and then everything else if the
game goes well I'll hope people Erie's
patches for them but if otherwise you
build for 10 series Nvidia maybe Vega
and 500 series AMD and call it a day
there which is why you see the
optimization differences now also I
should say this discussion goes further
with things like api's so a lot of games
are still DirectX 11 on PC those games
don't have very low-level access to the
hardware DirectX 11 is
it has a lot of obfuscation layers
between the game code and the hardware
there are extra layers in between so if
you think of it as a canonical view of a
pipeline where you've got sort of like
stop ABCD a and D are gonna be your code
and your hardware and there's a bunch of
stuff abstraction layers in between
they're called whereas with a console
it's basically direct to metal so
DirectX 12 or Vulcan equivalents would
be what you're using on console in terms
of programming straight to the hardware
without all the abstraction layers and
that's a big deal with DirectX 12
invoking on PC remove a lot of that
you'll see sniper and doom perform
exceptionally well on PC hardware that's
because they're low-level API is that
have been used properly and a lot of
DirectX 12 implementations on PC are
just wrappers so they're just wrapping
dx11 with it you end up with a slight
performance loss or equal performance
and that's why DX 12 doesn't always look
good on PC but basically answering your
question it's API and how the code is
written and the abstraction layers it
has to go through to get to where it's
going which is the hardware and then
tuning for one set of hardware I think
that's most of it I'm sure a couple of
you probably have some other stuff I've
overlooked you're left out but feel free
to leave it below for everyone else so
next one Jonas or yonus I'm not gonna
try your last name pet cat video think
about g4 is now cloud-based gaming PS if
you want to do a test I can give you my
account I think we have one GeForce now
it's a really good idea the idea that so
when I originally talked with Nvidia
about grid and other companies here's
think about years ago about something
similar the starting point for that is
when cable companies had more control
over TV the starting point was well
imagine going to the most-hated company
on the planet Time Warner Cable or AT&amp;amp;T
or Comcast or any of the other ones and
also being able to get gaming on demand
from them not just movies on demand so
that was kind of a starting point it was
an interesting idea where if you've got
a TV and you have a controller you lease
access to the games for however much
money they're willing to
Algie for which is probably a lot
because they're the worst companies on
the planet but that was the idea and
it's a pretty cool idea and that
processing would be done through
external servers hosted in their data
centers hopefully somewhat locally and
then you're just dealing with latency at
that point which can be adjusted for so
I really like the idea of it I don't
think we're there today and part of that
is because last I checked the upload and
download speed requirements were still
kind of high relative to what a lot of
even America gets well I say here in
America that's pretty bad here he set
the standard but other countries as well
of course so originally I think it was a
5 megabit per second up requirement
which was way too high and and then we
also had latency issues when I tried it
last time where they put us in front of
titanfall 2 and I just couldn't for the
life of me aim at anything because the
the response to the input was just to
delayed but for a game that's not
titanfall to you like maybe the witch or
something like that you'd be ok so I
think it has a ways to go I'm very
interested in the technology I think
Nvidia's implementation is a good one
where they have external servers that
process everything I would like to see
latency improved which they're working
on and and then a business model that
makes sense because originally the
prices were too high but they dropped
them so not yet they're not not there
yet
ok last couple ones we've got in version
who says pardon for the not so serious
question by any April Fool's plans in
mind nope
next question second last Jedi why don't
we see VR benchmarks how does CPU affect
the our performance is a 6600 came out
for VR 7700 K going to be much better
6600 Kay's well Oh 6600 K you'll be ok
for the most part we have VR benchmarks
we actually think it's the channel like
main video right now just go to the
channel and search for probably be our
benchmarks or 7700 K if you Google
search it's 7700 K versus r7 1700 gamers
Nexus VR benchmark you'll find it so
along with a couple of other outlets PCP
included we were some of the only people
to have really in-depth VR testing where
we had frame times we had frame drops
versus in synthesized frames versus
warps misses and all these cool
variables and elements and metrics for
VR the reason you don't see a lot of it
even from people who have it figured out
like us PC / anyone else who did figure
it out is because it's hard to do and
also the the view count is not great
either so you're dealing with hours of
setup just to get the testing ready to
go and then testing takes a long time
you need to test for longer intervals
it's also difficult because I have to
physically put the headset on walk
around and do the testing which means I
need to clear the room out I need to
adjust for employee schedules even
because it basically requires that I
have the lab to myself to do a VR test
and then further you have to take breaks
every now and then because otherwise it
is possible to get a pounding headache
from testing VR for say 8 hours and
dealing with low-end hardware that might
have stuttering and things like that
it's really not comfortable so it's
difficult to do it takes a lot of time
to set up and you'll probably lose money
but it's okay to do maybe quarterly or
something like that which is kind of how
we've approached it next one there last
last to last to X 0 for 1 Steve loved
the Shelf in the background looks great
thank you will you be testing reviewing
dear Bauer's sky like extract iframe yes
we have one
it is a pre-production sample I need to
get a final review production sample
from their Bower
I think he's sending one and then
hopefully we can do that we had a we had
to work on the clearance I basically
need to sand off some of the
pre-production model because it's very
slightly different from the production
model that you all would be buying last
one
mmm Lee what's wrong with the wood
backdrop shelves trying to keep up with
J's display yes well as you all know we
once filmed something in front of a peg
board with pegboard with tools on it and
someone called us out and said Linus
invented peg boards and that we were
copying him so it looks like
unfortunately we're gonna have to stop
filming in front of the shelves because
J also
invented shelves and and we did not
license shelves from J so J I'm really
sorry I didn't mean for it to go this
way but hopefully you can understand
we just we couldn't afford your
licensing fees so it'll be gone I guess
next video
pack it up thanks for watching guys
subscribe for more go to stored on
cameras nexus net to pick up one of the
new mod mats they have a black
background now and some other changes we
did a video on it and also patreon.com
slash gamers and axis tops that directly
and get access to the second video with
some extra patreon bagger questions I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
