hardcore overclocking and today we're
gonna be taking a look at gigabytes take
on the extremely ridiculous motherboard
for the equally ridiculous CPU say hello
to the gigabyte c6 2 1 horas extreme
gigabytes take on what a overclocking
LGA 36 well that this is much more
workstation II but still overclocked
workstation LGA 36 47 motherboard should
look like for the 28 core 31 75 X Xeon
from Intel before that this video is
brought to you by thermal grizzly and
their high-end thermal compounds thermal
grizzly makes cryo not paste for high
thermal performance and conductivity
without being electrically conductive so
you don't have to worry about shorting
components cryo knot is particularly
good for replacing stock GPU pastes as
cryo knot is a non curing compound
learn more at the link in the
description below so then but let's just
get right into it right so boards gonna
be 14 around $1400 I'm not sure when
it's going to be like the hitting retail
but it is basically a little bit cheaper
than than the you know the rog dominus
board that we looked at previously and
well arguably like you know it's
different it's different so let's go
over some of the differences so the
first thing power inputs gigabyte has
opted for a much less flexible power
input setup so you still have the split
12 volt power plane so half the VCC and
vrm runs off of this and the other half
runs off of that and the thing is that
by you're less flexible what I'm talking
about is that gigabyte opted for dual
eight pin CPU power connectors for both
halves of the vrm whereas Asus with the
dominus they had an extra 6 pin PCI e
power connector so if you had like a
1600 watt power supply which normally
only comes with two aprons P CPU power
connectors you could plug in your two 8
pins and you could plug in 2 6 pins and
you'd be able to power the the CPU with
just one PSU well this board you have
well you pretty much have to use dual
power supplies because most power
supplies don't come with eight CPU eight
well for CP
eight pins so yeah gigabyte has
basically decided that you know that
they're gonna force you into a dual PSU
setup if you're gonna be running this at
high you know high levels of CPU power
draw though honestly for most cooling
setups you're probably not gonna be able
to like you're very likely gonna be
cooling limited before your power
connecter limited so you might still get
away with a single PSU setup as long as
you don't go too ridiculous on how
you're cooling the CPU so anyway we do
also get of course the dual 24 pins
directly on the motherboard so that's
the PSU well the dual PS use power up in
sync
right you plug in both and you find like
the motherboard starts both of them at
the same time as a result and so that's
how the the power delivery is taken care
of and I just dropped my pen anyway
moving on we do get a reset switch a
power switch dual postcodes I am not
sure what they're doing with the second
one but either way these are always
super handy to have when troubleshooting
also this has RGB on it I just want to
point that out there's there's RGB on
this board like I have no idea how that
got on here but there's our DV anyway
then we have a random USB port inside
the sort of directly like inside the the
case essentially I mean personally on a
test bench I'd welcome that but I'm not
sure what the the use case would be in
like a workstation environment moving
along we also get a speaker on the board
which you know most like yeah most
consumer boards I guess I wouldn't
really consider this a consumer board I
mean like yeah this is just ridiculous
but so most consumer bought boards don't
don't bother with those were like
workstation boards generally do so that
that's present and get the color-coded
front panel header which I'm a fan of
clear CMOS jumper right above that it
makes it a lot easier to see what you're
plugging into the the ones that aren't
color-coded are just well it's not quite
as clear is it then we get a bios switch
for the dual file system this is a
gigabyte motherboard of course it has
dual BIOS there's very few gigabyte
motherboards that don't
the main vials here is actually socketed
which is kind of different from what
they normally do and then the backup
bios is soldered onto the board so the
cool thing is if you brick this one and
then also brick this one you can
probably just ask gigabyte to send you a
replacement but main BIOS chip and then
you're gonna be fine
there's also LEDs for indicating which
BIOS chip is active and those are right
there and that kind of covers it there's
no like retry button safe boot bus in
any of those sort of extreme
overclocking features that we saw in the
Dominus because gigabyte considers this
a workstation board and even then like
extreme overclocking boards from
gigabyte well know like when they do do
an extreme overclocking board it has all
of it like it has actually generally
more buses than anybody else out there
but uh yeah they're really treating this
more as a more as a workstation board
and that's why of course we have a ton
of PCIe 16x slots now they're not all
electrically PCIe x16 I mean we can kind
of clearly see that's an X 8 so that's
another X 8 that's this X 16 that looks
this looks like either an X 4 or an X 8
again that's probably an X 8 and that
looks like this should be an X 16 just
because it's the first one but it might
be an X 8 as well so you know tons of
PCI you connected PCIe expansion options
because it's meant for workstations and
to make sure that you don't melt your 24
pin power connector they have dual PCIe
6 pins if you I don't know maybe ran
like like you could technically rig up
7rx for ATS onto this like the you know
with like riser cables it'd be a pretty
bad idea as far as I'm concerned but you
could still do it it wouldn't also be
very practical but it is doable so
anyway they do give you dual 6 pin PCI
you power connectors to make sure that
the 24 pin doesn't melt I am NOT a fan
of the location ok just like I like lots
of workstation boards do this but
putting these right there is just like
so like what you're gonna run a cable
like that or you're gonna be running a
cable like that or you're gonna be well
you're not going to be running it across
the top edge of the board because
boards actually like taller than the
actual mounting holes right there so
this isn't gonna fit in like any cases
at all
so yeah like the this thing violates all
of the form factors it's it's it's it's
own thing anyway so yeah I'm really not
a fan of the location I totally
understand why they exist
I can even kind of understand well I
can't understand why they put them there
because it's not like this area of the
motherboard is particularly crowded I
mean this right here is for downright
empty and you know like there was no as
far as I'm concerned there was no reason
to cram all the i/o down here especially
no reason for that thing right like what
get rid of that this is obviously not
being used so you know a well thought
out a better thought out option would
have been to take these you know clear
out this area a bit you know you could
probably shift some of these things
apart a bit and then move those down
there and that would have been a much
like tidier layout to manage cable wise
but uh anyway they decided to stick it
right there and here's one of those
things that you know is just more
workstation about this board that like
this didn't actually end up getting on
the board but you can see that there was
a there was originally plans for a base
board management controller to actually
be on this motherboard so that's
essentially like a server server thing
which allows you to manage the system
remotely and yeah Bay that they decided
that they're not actually going to
bother with implementing that so I mean
I'm not I'm not sure how much of a much
of a big deal it is do anyone I I don't
know that you would actually like want
to build a server with one of these I
mean on a core now well no there are
definitely use cases for like a hike or
count high frequency server but I just I
kind of feel like if you really care
about your single threaded performance
you're just gonna buy a ninety nine
hundred K and build a server with that
anyway because that's just gonna like
the the issue with all of the the Zeon's
and all of the chips above x2 like above
LGA 1151 is that they use a mesh
interconnect and it's really quite like
compared to the ring interconnect that
you get on like a ninety nine hundred K
its relatively high latency
it's like approaching
like it's not anywhere near as bad as
like AMD's infinity fabric on latency
but it's getting there it's definitely
worse than ring and so if you had like a
really really really single threaded
workload
I wouldn't use a mesh CPU for it just
because mesh sucks so for for single
threaded workloads so anyway moving
along we can kind of see that gigabyte
opted for a more like the the actual Ryo
is actually kind of bare there's not
much here which is again I think the
logic being that you know it's a
workstation board if you want USB ports
Ethernet ports whatever ports you got
PCIe use it so yeah that's kind of what
we can see going on in the i/o section
there and that pretty much covers it
there's not really much you know random
junk just added on to this board because
this this really like gigabyte
understands that nobodies get like the
the couple people on earth who are gonna
buy this anyway are probably not gonna
be it like they're they're not gonna use
wife I like onboard Wi-Fi or something
so gigabyte hasn't bothered with
anything like that though for some
reason they did stick RGB on there
either never gonna wrap my head around
that head around that but uh before we
get onto the voltage regulators check
out this heatsink I'm a fan of this
heatsink now it's you know there there's
no fans in it so gigabyte has opted for
a completely passive design it is one
giant block of aluminum and this boards
got to be so damn heavy like seriously
like this is one hell of an aluminum
block likely crit yes so anyway I am
actually a fan of like this cooling
cooling design and I think if they if it
actually manages to maintain it like it
should manage to maintain the VR I'm
completely an adequate thermally with
this kind of design because actually
because this heatsink so damn big the
gaps between the fins are actually quite
large so it's not like they're super
airflow restrictive like you'd like
really dense thin snacks are actually
kind of like they they prevent airflow
within them so yeah this should do a
stellar job
cooling the vrm and worst case scenario
it's just gonna take forever for this to
overheat because of how freakin heavy it
is aluminum is actually not that bad in
thermal in terms of its thermal capacity
so it just gets mixed up because it's
really like you know everybody thinks oh
it's so light it doesn't have a ton of
thermal capacity well no relative to its
mass it actually has a really high
thermal capacity per unit mass but it's
just a lot lighter so it is still like
we're like a solid block of copper is
still better than a solid like equally
sized block of aluminum but it's not
that big a difference as you would
expect just based on the weight anyway
let's go back to the voltage regulators
and voltage well I mean there's a lot of
them around the board but obviously
everybody just mostly cares about this
great big strip of power we should we
shall call it that so that right there
is the VCC in and unlike Asus where you
know with the Dominus we had a lot of
power stages and not a lot of phases
here we have a lot of power stages and
equally many phases this is a 32 phase
we will not be counting that but we will
be counting the quadruple errs that this
uses and I give up on fixing GIMP so
quadruped layers are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 &amp;amp; 8
over here so that's how we get our 32
phases each of these essentially takes
in one PWM signal and splits it in to
four in the process they cut down the
switching frequency to 1/4 which is
actually a good thing for your
efficiency because you're ultimately
interleaving all of these anyway so like
the one of the trade-offs between
voltage regulator switching frequency
and phase well it's like more switching
frequency means less power efficiency
okay generally you're gonna lose power
efficiency as you crank up your
switching frequency but the benefit of
that is you get better output ripple now
another way to get better output ripple
is to interleave a bunch of phases
because if you have a whole
phases interleaving they'll actually
sort of fill in the the gaps between the
well whatever it's too complicated I'm
not gonna just describe that in this
video but essentially interleaving
phases helps with you're out having a
bunch of phases helps with your output
ripple so this does have a ton of
freaking phases and then it cuts down
the switching frequency going through
the doubler so you actually can get the
sort of the best of both worlds where
you have really good output ripple and
really good at efficiency at the same
time now the one downsides of doublers
is that they put a little bit of delay
on to your PWM signals it's generally
sort of 10 to 20 nanoseconds depending
on what kind of signal you're trying to
actually transmit so that's something to
keep in mind and that can lead to you
know sort well it essentially means that
your transient response can potentially
be more like it can make it much harder
to optimize it for whatever target goals
you may have for your transient response
anyway so gigabyte is using the 35 99s
here and they are using 8 of them so we
do end up with a 32 phase BCC in VRM it
is controlled by this chip right over
here in the middle of the middle of the
board and I actually really like how
it's located right here and we can
actually see the eight current sense
inputs so like one two three four five
six seven eight and so this is one of
like the issue well this is an issue
with any kind of multi-phase like double
design or quadruple design the actual
controller itself does not see
individual phases doesn't see every
single one of the phases it essentially
still sees this as a giant blob of eight
phases and the controller here is I am
NOT gonna put that on there nobody's
gonna be able to read that is of course
the IR 35 to zero one that we find on
basically every modern motherboard ever
these days like the only other chip
you're ever gonna look probably like
high-end boards you're ever only other
chip you're ever gonna see is like an is
l69 one three eight one three eight you
know yeah sixteen nine one three eight
anyway this goes up to two megahertz
switching frequency though I really
doubt that's what they're actually
running this format so I'm going with
the operating frequency for this voltage
regular like this vrm to be at most at
one point six megahertz on the
controller which would translate about
400 kilohertz on each of the phases and
that is running in eighth plus zero
phase configuration the chip can also
run in things like six plus two and
anything sort of below those two options
so also a seven plus one so the actual
power stage is used in each of the
phases are gigabytes favorite highlight
well yeah they do use these alot so IR
35:56 is these are 50 amp power how I
our stages so you know power or stages
from international rectifier so that's
why they replace the ER with IR and
essentially like they're not as so on
the Dominus we saw 17 amp smart power
stages also from while Infineon at this
point and those are basically a bit
better at well those are a bit smarter
than powell i our stages but these
aren't exactly dumb so they still
integrate current monitoring they still
integrate temperature monitoring they
just don't have some of the same
safeties and the current monitoring quoi
isn't quite as accurate as it is on the
smart power stages so yeah that's that's
the that's the power stage that could go
by opposite of four and so the resulting
efficiency for this 32 phase monstrosity
is four well we're gonna be going with
1.8 volts output so that's our standard
output voltage for all integrated
voltage regulator based CPUs like the
Zeon 31 75 X 400 kilohertz switching
frequency because that's just where the
data is she is spectat so that makes my
life easier and also it's actually like
kinda on the upper limits of what you
would realistically want to run this at
anyway it's quite possible that this
board actually runs it like 200
kilohertz on each phase which like sets
the the
watching losses for each of the phases
and then 5volts drive because while the
35:56 is do actually get more efficient
at higher drive voltages they are
actually they're not necessarily built
to like lasts as long at the higher
drive voltages and it's much more
convenient to just grab five volts off
of your 24 pin then messing around with
building like a seven volt or a six volt
voltage regulator just to power the vrm
so anyway the efficiency results well
this is kind of interesting so for 270
watts it's a hundred and fifty amps
output this voltage regulator will
produce about 21 watts of heat which is
ever so slightly worse than what we were
looking at on the dominus but then at
higher outputs it actually gets a little
bit ahead and I think this is mostly
down to the fact that the the scaling
for all of these operating parameters
isn't optimal at low current outputs but
like anyway it like the the air is not
gonna be huge so very very small
advantage while small disadvantage
compared to the Dominus there the
Dominus would be doing about 19 watts
once we get into the efficiency curve of
these 35:56 power stages properly which
you know starts up at well I mean we
don't really get into the power like the
the peak of the power efficiency curve
is a long way away but still like at
very low loads power stages just have
issues and that's one of the smart man
tidge is actually that the small power
stages have very low loads they are
slightly more efficient than all of the
modern then the older power our stages
that we have here which you can actually
see right there because this is just way
too little current you essentially what
like you wouldn't need a vrm heatsink
all not at all at this kind of current
output so anyway moving on to something
a bit more reasonable 540 watts this is
usually where more like at least for
like other platforms say X 299 this is
around where your water cooling is just
going to not be able to keep up anymore
though I have heard that apparently it's
possible to cool more on LGA 3647 which
might be just down to the die being so
much larger but anyway so 540 watts
which would be at 300 amps output you're
gonna be looking at about 32 watts of
heat output which is a small advantage
in favour for this board over the
Dominus so the Dominus would have been
doing about 35 watts now admittedly
these calculate like these aren't super
accurate so I honestly consider these
pretty much equal anyway yeah it's
interesting how basically you know 50
amp hour stages don't like you'd think
there'd be a bigger difference but at
these low loads it's just kind of like
well they're within margin of error cos
we're far out of the sort of the peak of
the efficiency curve and really like the
Dominus will start to pull away the more
current you stall or start pushing you
know push through it but with this many
damn phases they'll like you need a lot
of current to maintance start making a
difference anyway moving up to a hut 810
watts which like that that's gonna be
really really hard to cool if if it's
even possible I'm not sure but uh 810
watts and not 600 I'm Rick miss reading
my notes four hundred and fifty amps
output you're gonna be looking at about
45 watts of heat dissipation on the vrm
and at that point the heatsink might
start becoming somewhat useful though I
still think this would probably you
might not run at a great temperature but
it would probably still not run at over
a hundred twenty-five degrees Celsius at
that point so that would still be
relatively tolerable to just kind of run
run without any kind of heatsink on
there anyway going yet higher a thousand
and eighty watts of CPU power
consumption pushing six hundred amps
through the vrm you're gonna be looking
at about 58 watts of heat and at this
point you might want to you know the the
heatsink might be a good idea at this
point and then thirteen hundred and
fifty watts of heat you're gonna be
looking at about seven hundred and fifty
amps and so CPU power consumption 1350
watts 750 amps and about 77 watts of
heat on the vrm which is still
funnily enough like the all of like even
now this still has a small advantage
over the voltage regulator on the
Dominus which is basically a combination
as far as I'm concerned it's a
combination of the relatively low
switching frequency and the fact that
these are 50 amp hour stages and that
the efficiency curve like we're still
not really you know passed like we're
still like the the efficiency curve is
just messed is not working out in favor
of these voltage regulators with this
many phases though I think this might be
at the peak for for these so past this
the Dominus would start winning though
it is worth noting that in der bauer
like der bauer did a video with
overclocking the 3071 3175 acts on lnto
and he topped out at only around twelve
hundred and twenty-five watts on the
actual like on the eight pins so he
never managed to get over to twelve
hundred watts and this right here would
actually be because this is output power
this isn't input power so this would
actually be like fourteen and what is
that that's like 1427 watts on the eight
pin power connectors right there
so yeah the this board is like you know
it's it's slightly less ridiculous
overkill but it's still ridiculous
overkill and the bit better balanced in
my opinion you know and also it's nice
that it's like four hundred dollars
cheaper i guess so that that's maybe oh
we're worth a thing worth considering
anyway it's just like it's a silly
platformer with silly motherboards silly
voltage regulators and silly price
points so the end result is just yeah
it's ridiculous and i'm like like so far
none of the boards i've seen for the
like unfortunate I know there's
basically three boards that I'm aware of
that will be for this platform which is
like this one the Dominus and then the
one that EVGA is working on and I think
at this point EVGA is probably going to
be the one brain
the reasonable voltage regulator this is
not one of them this is this is a
slightly less ridiculous thing compared
to the Dominus but still is just massive
massive overkill so yeah I mean you know
well I'm not surprised after the Dominus
that's that's where I'll leave it anyway
moving on to the minor rails I hear we
have what I assume is VCC si just
because this location kind of makes
sense for that rail that's on just a
3553 which is the Gigabyte favorite 40
amp smart 40 amp power stage not smart
so it's like it's the same product line
as the 35:56 it's just a smaller package
it's cheaper not by much mind you and
yeah gigabyte uses that unlike a ton of
motherboards like they it seems to have
way too many of those because they're
everywhere but yeah so the the 40 amp
power of power IR stages right there and
for the controller we're looking at an
IR 3 v 2 0 4 so this is one of the
things like other things like gigabyte
has done compared to the Dominus like
remember in the Dominus video I was like
yeah Asus just smacked in ASP 1405 I'm
like literally every single rail they
could find which makes very little sense
because the ASP 1405 is probable is like
an 8 phase voltage controller and so
asus was essentially wasting these 8
phase voltage controllers on like
single-phase rails well gigabyte has
enough sense to actually go buy a
different chip that isn't another ir35
2:01 so if this was done like the
Dominus we would see that chip right
there and here and here and also there
like all of those would be more 35 to 0
ones but gigabyte decided you know what
that that's just silly
so they actually opted for 3 5 2 0 4s
and the 3 5 2 0 4 is essentially a four
phase variant of the 3 5 2 0 1 is it for
Phase II is for phase or 3 I can't
remember right now how many phases
it goes up to four it totally goes up to
four anyway it doesn't really matter
because we're like not going to be
hitting the limits of what it can
control either way but so they have a
three five two zero four up there and
that one's just running in 1+0
configuration this one over here is
running in three plus zero and takes
care of our VDD our rail which is this
three-phase right here yet more 3553 s
so just more of those from international
rectifier then down here we have what I
assume is gonna be so this should be VPP
and that's some kind of fully integrated
buck converter on there and so that's
its own thing we have another rail like
that over there which is a VPP and
that's that's a supporting rail it's
it's a 2.5 volts and it's for the member
for the dims for the ddr4 memory anyway
so we have those then we have what I can
only assume to be VCC io over here which
is another 35 53 and a 3 5 2 0 4 and
then we have these two regulators which
I honestly don't know what those do and
then regulators over here which I also
don't know what those do something has
to be powering the chipset which could
potentially also be that and there's
gonna be just minor rails all over the
place but without having the board in
hand it's like well without having the
board in hand or at least like an Intel
platform specification which I didn't
manage to find yeah it's really hard to
tell what any of those are but there's a
bunch of minor rails all over the board
and those just use yet more
international rectifier parts I wouldn't
worry about them you're probably never
gonna like you'd never on the off chance
that the BIOS gives you control over
them you'd never want to change them
anyway because they don't do anything
like it's bad if they stop working but
there's no point messing with them 90%
of the time anyway VDD are over here is
yet another three-phase so controlled by
yet another three five two zero four so
that covers it gigabytes take on the
extremely ridiculous motherboard for the
equally ridiculous 31 equals CPU
admittedly gigabytes extremely
ridiculous mother motherboard is like
ever so slightly less ridiculous than
the Asus one it's also ever so slightly
less ridiculous like less expensive I
mean $1400 versus $1,800 well it's not
like it's gonna fund and you tights it
like you're probably gonna be running
tights and RT X's on something like this
anyway so at that point I guess I guess
you could put the money towards more
water cooling because you'll probably
need it for the CPU if you plan to do
any serious overclocking so yeah that's
it for the video thank you for watching
like share subscribe leave any comments
questions suggestions down in the
comment section below if you'd like to
support gamers Nexus well there's no mod
map on the screen right now but there's
a store gamers not stored gamers Nexus
dotnet for any sort of like shirts mod
mats and another merch you'd like to buy
there's also the gamers Nexus patreon if
you'd like to support us directly and I
have a channel called actually hardcore
overclocking where I do other
overclocking related content so that's
it for the video thanks for watching and
