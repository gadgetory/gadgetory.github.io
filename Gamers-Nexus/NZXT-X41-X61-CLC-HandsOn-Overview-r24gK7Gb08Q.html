nexus dotnet and i am not wearing a GN
shirt for once because i'm being really
lazy so this is not actually a special
occasion but it is somewhat interesting
because i'm doing a quick overview here
of some new clcs from NZXT I can't
benchmark these yet because we're
waiting on some software updates for the
review samples but I can't show you what
we have here so this is the new x 61 and
next to me we have the x 41 and these
are one digit increments over there x 60
+ x 40 predecessors which were also
supplied by a stick so these are clcs
they are closed loop liquid coolers and
we've got one that fits 2 1 40
millimeter fans and one that fits 11 40
millimeter fan and beyond that pretty
much the the major changes for these are
going to be software side these actually
link up to n TFC's new cam software so
that's kind of cool it's very useful if
you want to control the LED color on the
on the top of the pump through cam or if
you want to control the pump speed this
is a variable pump speed pump go figure
on the CLC so that is quite unlike most
other CLC's on the market NZXT claims i
mean the first however i believe i could
change the pump speeds on at least one
other products in the past and i think
it was an txt 1250 but i may be wrong on
that that may have been a fan speed
check out our reviews on the website if
you want to see what I'm talking about
I'm sure it is on there so we have
controllable pump speed which ultimately
means lower noise levels and you can
kind of moderate the thermals in that
regard I would imagine for the most part
you really don't want to run the pump at
max speed because it will be a tiny bit
louder for most users you're going to be
safe running around the mid-range and
then there is a silent setting as well
if you are running this on say an htpc
where you're really going to notice
every tiny amount of noise coming out of
the box because maybe it's running your
movies or something like that so that's
what we've got here I just wanted to
show these office again x 61 and the x
41 I cannot yet state whether I think
these are worth buying so don't go by
them just yet wait for the full review
which will hopefully be online by the
end of this week depend on one
txt guess the drivers going so wait for
the full review before buying and just
basing off the original x 40 + x 60 they
were pretty good coolers I believe the
h110 slightly outperformed the x 60 but
ultimately in my review i determined
that i prefer the x 60 x 40 because they
had software control for the fan speeds
whereas the h110 did not corsair's
iseries coolers are the only ones that
use software control so the psalter
control makes a huge difference because
you can mitigate the noise levels and
the noise level on these stock fans can
be pretty loud when they're run at
maximum voltage this is the fan ntsc has
changed the design slightly here it's
actually going to absorb sound or absorb
vibration excuse me much better now they
have these added rubber dampers here on
the on the sides the corners where
you're actually mounting it and they've
got a couple of changes going on just in
the chassis of the fan in general I'm
sure that is for airflow or thermal
purposes i don't really know that it
does it does much for you in the way of
appearance it does look a little bit
cooler but it's a fan so if you cares
right so that's what we've got check the
subscribe to the channel for the full
review when i have that ready for you in
the meantime hit the website check out
the cool stuff we've got a lot of stuff
up there as of this past week and I will
see you all next time peace what do I do
with all this stuff I'm trapped</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
