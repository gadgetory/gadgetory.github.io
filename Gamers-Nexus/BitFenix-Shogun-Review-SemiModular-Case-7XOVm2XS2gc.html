The Prodigy small form-factor case a few
years ago and has been trying to
recreate that success ever since the
BitFenix shinobi was the company's semi
recent attempt at a mid tower enclosure
and now they're going after what the
company calls quote the super mid tower
market with the BitFenix Shogun the
Shogun is what we're reviewing today
this is a $160 case that mixes aluminum
glass and steel for its monolithic
stature and stone-dead visits on the
front panel and before getting to the
review this video is brought to you by
raw fury proprietors of fantastic indie
PC games like Kingdom a game that we
reviewed and liked some time ago and the
new hell em up game tormentor ex
Punisher where everyone has just one HP
check the link in the description below
for more information the Phoenix's
Shogun is the company's new flagship and
mixes a semi custom approach to
functionality which we'll go through in
this case and the expected residence of
RGB LED is located in a few places
throughout the chassis the materials use
the top panel somewhat resembles the
prodigy case and it's got a 2 millimeter
thick sheet of aluminum and then the
bottom is also a 2 millimeter thick
aluminum it helps elevate the case and
then it goes all the way under the case
so you're protected from some of the
dust in theory and then further the
internal materials are standard it's
steel and plastic and the steel for the
chassis the motherboard tray is about
one millimeter thick which is denser
than a lot of the cases that are in the
sub $100 mark this is a bit more than
that anyway but those tend to be
somewhere in the 0.6 to 0.8 millimeter
thick steel just for frame of reference
the panel in use is a little bit
stylized it's sort of a parallelogram
for the glass side panel the other glass
side panel is blacked out and it's not
just tinted black it's if you take the
fin off and look at the back of it it's
just black as in literally impossible to
see through it so interesting choice on
BitFenix as part for the glass side
panels if you look carefully at the
front it looks like their support for a
five and a quarter inch optical drive
but that's not the case it's entirely a
cosmetic move other cosmetic items are
mostly relegated to things that that
also serve a functional purpose in this
case like better for thought put into
cable
management with thanks to modular drive
cages an optional EA TX extended
motherboard tray shield and an optional
quasi shroud for the PSU this part is
among the more interesting items the
shroud only covers the window side and
does not cover the top side of the PSU
embedded within it's more industrial
exterior are two two and a half inch
compartments each outfitted with RGB
LEDs that are for once actually sort of
unique the LEDs can be relocated to
light the SSDs horizontally or
vertically or it can be removed entirely
we like that BitFenix has realized
alongside NZXT that SSDs are a major
blame points going forward and granted
the 2.5 inch form factor will eventually
fade some of these drives do look cool
enough to show off we do think that the
LEDs aligning the SSD cage are
disappointing overall but the Phoenix
has the right idea the lights would be
better executed had BitFenix opted for a
thin diffuser to spread the light better
rather than the hard brightness of just
the LED bulb shining through a stronger
LED may have also helped in this regard
but the rest of the cases LEDs are
controllable through the built-in dummy
controller that grants seven colors or
an RGB cycle along with a simple off
setting you can connect your own
controller if you prefer door plug-in to
ACS aura which seems to be getting some
dominance among the smaller case
manufacturers these days including in
win with their rog certification or so
they call it this mix of modular
components is the overall theme for the
Shogun the hard drive cages are all
removable except for one which is the
bottom set of cages behind the shroud
and that bottom set gives you a
permanent two three and a half inch
drive support and then the top cage is
you've got two of them each one can be
removed or left in in addition to those
as you'll see there are holes riddling
the motherboard tray each of those holes
can be used to relocate the cages or
video card supports which are largely
not necessary I mean they're just
they're totally unnecessary unless you
have an exceptionally heavy video card
like one of the over kills of attack
cards that came out for the 1080s for
the most part you won't need those but
if you have a card and sag is a concern
you could throw the video card mounts in
there the power supply shroud is also
removable and could
taken out completely if you wanted to
relocate the SSDs elsewhere as is the
optional EA T X extender which is mostly
used to conceal cabling on the backside
of the case when looking through or to
add extra pass throughs for EA 2 X
motherboards concealing the cabling is
further assisted by the blackout
tempered glass right side panel and
shows that BitFenix grasp so what a few
other manufacturers don't that tempered
glass on the right side generally means
the user has to work harder to keep
those cables clean and then looking back
for a moment at those video cards
support structures you'll notice that
there's foam on the top side which is
just to protect the video card and it's
faceplate
there's also foam facing the side panel
we were curious about this and asked
BitFenix why that foam was there the one
facing outward and they just said it was
for looks so can't really argue with
that
it does seem unnecessary but again for
looks what are you gonna say as for the
stock cooling configuration the fan
comes with two 120 millimeter fans
mounted in front that be sort of front
center and front bottom and that
configuration means that all of the air
is for the most part being directed at
the GPU rather than the CPU there's no
straight across from the CPU fan it's
all straight across from the GPU or over
the GP in the backplate a third and
final fan is located in the back and
that's your standard 120 millimeter rear
exhaust oriented directly across from
our CPU tower cooler if you saw this
case listing previously or have seen
other reviews you've likely seen and
heard that the front reportedly supports
three 120 millimeter fans however in
working with the case that's not true it
does support three 140 millimeter fans
in the front you'd of course have to
swap the other 120 s out for that and we
tested one alternative configuration
when adding a single 140 millimeter fans
at the top of the front panel which
directs air straight at the CPU we
notified BitFenix about this 3 120
millimeter alleged support and they
confirmed that it officially supports
two 120 millimeter front fans and then
corrected the site listing and for the
normal testing methodology as always the
link in the description below has the
full article for this case where patrick
Lathan has the complete review and
walkthrough of everything but we also
have a testing methodology defined where
we talk about things like what does
delta T mean if that confuses you or if
you're not sure why idle can be below
ambient because it's not it's a delta T
value check the article it is defined
there and walks you through how all of
the testing works and what Delta values
are and how we obtain them and how we
use thermocouple readers to actively
monitor ambient internal case ambient
stuff like that let's start with the GPU
thermals in our test the intake fans
kept the GPU well supplied with cool air
for a respectable temperature of just
under 52 Salus delta T but this cool air
continued flowing out the back of the
case without ever touching the CPU
comparatively the corsair 270 r and the
NZXT s340 elites are just behind this in
performance moving to CPU temperature is
with the case fans at their maximum at
1260 rpm and the CPU is shown running at
60 1.74 degrees Celsius above ambient
this isn't especially impressive but is
unsurprising given the size and speed of
the fans alongside their location with
the hard drive cage is installed you're
also redirecting a lot of that airflow
again towards the GPU this puts the
Shogun right behind the n1 303 when
we've added fans to it so that's not the
stock configuration that's with
aftermarket fans but below the toasty 60
6.18 Celsius DT that our previously
reviewed pure base 600 managed adding a
Corsair 140 millimeter fans the front
intake array drove CPU temperatures down
to 50 5.7 delta T and that's Celsius of
course landing it ahead of the st 40
elite the Cullinan and behind the
Corsair cases this is because that 140
millimeter fan again drives air straight
across the CPU it's never going anywhere
else and creates somewhat of a tunnel of
airflow into the cooler and out of the
tower
moving on to noise testing we see the
stock Shogun with its three 120
millimeter fans performing right around
where the Corsair 570 X sits when the
570 X has its three 120 millimeter fans
configured to 1050 rpm at the quieter
speed of 1000 rpm for the Shogun the
BitFenix case measures @ 32.6 DBA when
containing our standardized test bench
and of course the internal components
like the GPU and the CBF n matter a lot
more here
the phoenixes Shogun that feels
appropriately priced to likely be quiet
pure bass 600 that we just reviewed
earlier this week the Shogun includes it
several semi modular and fully modular
features useful for tuning the case
specifically to your needs it granted
this also means that you're paying more
and receiving more Hardware as a results
so if the modular Bay is the PSU shroud
and the VGA holders aren't interesting
to you you're going to be shelling out
the money anyway for those unused parts
at $160 this is one of the better cases
we've looked at recently it has a few
shortcomings one would be probably want
to change the cooling configuration a
little bit which isn't that hard to do
and can be done for fairly cheap but it
does offset your cost if you're planning
to buy another fan still one $60
baseline puts this around where the
Corsair 5 70 X the mastercase pro 5
would land and some of the inland lineup
just in terms of the aluminum amalgam I
guess and when kind of does that for
their thing so if you like aluminum or
if you like aluminum and steel in the
case of this one look into things like
in when Leon Lee but otherwise the
corsair 570 acts the Coolermaster
mastercase pro is quite a bit different
from this but same price category and
some of those cases might be worth
looking into other than this overall the
build quality is high the quality of
material is pretty high there's a
downside in the installation process in
the factory where they've actually
torqued the hell out of the screws so
that is a problem we've seen with some
other cases coming out of the same
factories or even just cases in general
from NZXT they've had that problem for a
long time where the thumb screws for
some of the mounting hardware that's
modular in here get torqued so much so
there's actually physical cosmetic only
damage to those components cosmetic only
doesn't really matter a whole lot at the
end of the day but it's a small thing
that it could be improved upon and
certainly doesn't that doesn't need to
be that much abuse to the hardware LEDs
the LEDs are not that impressive so if
that matters to you maybe look at
alternatives because there are plenty of
other cases with better LEDs maybe the
best approach would be to add LEDs to
this case they're actually a bit Phoenix
didn't send us an LED controller which
would be a separate purchase that we
haven't played around with yet but I
guess you could throw one of theirs in
there if you didn't want to go for
something like you
plus or the SP RGB fans LEDs overall
stock though aren't that impressive but
they have the right idea of allowance
and modularity so that's that's pretty
much it for the BitFenix Shogun if
you're interested in this case as always
we'll have a link to it in the
description below and then of course the
