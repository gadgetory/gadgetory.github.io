recap for the last week we have a lot of
good news items for this one including
the AMD rx 560 aka rx 460 controversy
right now the Intel z170 motherboard
that has been made to support coffee
like that's an interesting one as well
cascade lake as a CPU coming up from
Intel and then a couple sales for the
week and some other new products coming
out to the market before we get into
that this content is brought to you by
the Thermaltake flow RGB closed-loop
liquid cooler which is a 360 millimeter
radiator plus 3 120 fans that are RGB
illuminated the if then we'll take it
ringing fans at that this is a 4.5 done
a detect pump which is one of the faster
pumps you can learn more at the link in
the description below so let's start
with the RX 560 discussion and we'll
start it off with this does anyone
remember when AMD launched shade at
Nvidia they stuffed a bunch of shade
into a shade cannon and fired shade at
Nvidia that was basically a Twitter
campaign that said 4 gigabytes means 4
gigabytes and this was going on right
around when the GTX 970 controversy of
being 3 point 5 gigabytes plus 512 of
slower memory was going on so if four
equals four one would also assume that
1024 equals 1024 or that eight 96 equals
896 the thing here is that the AMD rx
560 graphics card when it shipped was
basically an rx 460 that was fully
unlocked that was mentioned to us in
media it was actually in one of the
first two lines in our review of the 560
it was basically an Rx 560 is an RX 460
with the two extra ciues unlocked for
you you could have unlock them on the
460 previously with a BIOS flash and a
signed driver but the 560 unlocked it
for you which gave in our testing at the
high end 7 to 9 percent performance
increase over a 460 in the 2 that we
tested and that was from the extra C use
you have 2 extra C use each one has 64
cores so you know about 1024 instead of
890
that's pretty noteworthy difference and
the clock speeds were a bit different as
well just like all the 500 series so
that was the whole point of the 560 was
it's a better 460 that's unlocked for
you in advance and now looking around
Newegg and elsewhere a few folks have
pointed out that the RX 5 60's are
available in 896 core versions actually
at the same price as the 1024 core
variants in some cases and so these are
our x4 sixties that's what it is and
before getting further into it
for those of you who have tweeted at us
or suggested articles online or asked
there have been a lot of questions of
can you test the two different types of
our x5 60s we already did we tested them
in like April or whatever they came out
the RX 560 that is claimed on Newegg
assuming the listing is legitimate and
not just a description error that RX 560
with 896 cores is an Rx 460 there is no
difference whatever difference exists is
in whatever clocks the AIB partner has
pre applied so in terms of performance
look at our review of the 560 versus the
460 that's the difference between them
now as for what's going on here we asked
Andy for a statement they have not
provided one yet but they are working on
one at time of filming so there's a good
chance we'll get one around or slightly
after when this goes live as soon as we
do we'll put it in the top comment below
along with a link to the article about
it if we write one in the meantime
basically it comes down to some rh5 60's
being rx4 60s ie clearing inventory or a
mistake by the retailer and then
basically it's gonna be the worst
performance and you actually think
you're getting because you're looking at
the car and buying it based on a review
we wrote everyone else wrote that's
built on a device that has more cores so
that's problem if it's if it's real now
looking into this trying to determine if
this is actually a problem the first up
of course call or discuss
Thandi and wait for a statement which we
did we didn't get an immediate rebuttal
so we'll see what they say next up was
contact a bunch of HIV partners who were
caught off guard with the whole issue so
they're looking into it on there and as
well lady mailed a MD and or at least
the ones we've spoken with her caught
off guard and then the third step on our
end
was checked the AMD specifications page
the RX 560 spec page now when it says
compute units it says 14/16 and it says
stream processors it says 896 slash 1024
if you use archive.org wayback machine
go back to when it launched it says
compute unit max compute unit 16 so max
compute units you could perceive to mean
up to so not technically wrong if you
look at it that way up to 16
was it marketed that way absolutely not
it was marketed as 16 but either way
there's a slight hole there to escape
through the street and processors one is
a little bit harder because that one
says specifically 1024 it doesn't say up
to 1024 or 896 to ten to one it just
says 1024 which goes with 16 compute
units mathematically that's how it works
so the marketing and the spec page
originally would suggest those numbers
the new spec page aligns with the Newegg
listings which would lead me to believe
presently that it is not necessarily
just an error by the retailer the new
spec page change coincides with those
and suggests a reduced core count and by
way of reduced C you can see there's a
couple other things in there as well and
that basically if you're looking at
reviews
it's an Rh 460 just be really careful if
you buy 560 it's it's unfortunate that
we have to say this because we just went
through and recommended the 516 on our
builds so make sure you buy the right
one they're only a couple right now that
seems to be showing the 896 power color
has one of the devices up but yeah if
it's not if the counts not listed don't
buy it or find the count listed
somewhere else other than this and these
changed a couple things on the
the spec page so for example they change
that the compute listed in teraflops is
now listed in gigaflops which I guess
bigger number looks better or something
like that but it's not actually changed
I don't think it's just a different
measure unit of measurement so yeah
we've reached out to Andy for comment
we'll update when we get one but be
careful of 460 and 560 purchases and AMD
maybe don't throw shade around if you're
gonna do something similar later yeah so
very sad pretty annoying but we'll we'll
see what happens maybe they have a
statement that actually makes sense or
maybe it's just trying to clear
inventory will let you know for sure
next story though is on the z170 board
that from a Baidu user now supports
coffee lake apparently and this was
validated with cpu-z
validation and everything so the initial
stories about the intel z 370 platform
indicated that intel needed to make the
change to accommodate the coffee like
cpus for improved power efficiency and
things like that different pin
arrangement in terms of what each pin
does but not a different pin count or
even a different socket type so the
reason for z 372 exists was mostly just
the power layout and design of the board
something that a couple of board
partners told us as well and this meant
that z 172 sony boards would not support
coffee like but a user was able to mod
the msi z170a xpower titanium to support
an 83 50 K CPU and they did so by tuning
microcode and bios on the board the
system boots all the way into Windows
and even registers the CPU with cbz
validation confirming the change worked
but a few things aren't fully functional
like the IGP being disabled and the
first PCIe slot not working but it does
look like it at least boots and gets
into Windows and to build on this we
kind of shortly mentioned a long time
ago that and a partner of Intel informed
us prior to launch that they had
functional older boards like 100 series
200 series that were
Coffee like CPUs successfully and that
basically it was just a switch that was
thrown to make that not possible the
explanation depend again who was asked
was basically it's to support it in
terms of power efficiency but clearly
you can kind of make it work so kind of
interesting I don't know that you should
expect to be able to do it yourself
anytime soon with a fully functional
board but we'll keep an eye on it and if
you hear more please let us know you can
tweet that gamers access next story
still in town so cascade Lake X this is
a continuation of the h EDT line and
intel's looking at fourth quarter 2018
for the shipment of what they're calling
cascade lake x and this is still on the
accelerated schedule right now it's
somewhat loosely related to the previous
h EDT schedules we're within a one to
two year launch period for the next
platform but the current rumor is that
the new cascade lake x lineup will still
be using the mesh interconnect
architecture that's found on skylake x
as opposed to the rain bus architecture
and it should be heavily targeted at
multi-threaded workloads similar to sky
league acts like the 79 ad XC this is a
continuation of that for other
information we broke a story a while ago
that intel would be shipping be 360 and
HD 70 platforms in first quarter of 2018
we received some documents through a
source who is partnered with Intel and
we're able to determine first quarter
for those that looks like it remains the
case so that's still on the slides we
published don't really have any changes
to them and these platforms should be
shipping alongside the new Pentium the
i3 the i5 CPUs and that end I sevens
actually that includes parts like VI 580
650 8550 8500 be the 8320 80/20 the
Pentium gold lines there's a ton of CPU
SKUs and an attack has a massive table
with all these details if you want to
learn more for the basics though the the
10 a new one is the B demarkation so
this is presently undefined I think but
it could be
indicative of his intended use in
something like a bee platform b-series
platform which originally was targeted
for businesses but has kind of been
commandeered for use as budget gaming
builds but that's kind of what our
suspicion is right now we also don't
know the TDP of those might be lower TDP
the next news item is kind of cool so
this is a reven diable closed-loop
liquid cooler the manufacturer announced
their new at nya 240 closed-loop cooler
which offers users the ability to add
coolant dye to the loop showcased
through an acrylic pump block housing
and lit with an LED backlight the same
injector port can be used to refill the
cooler easily as well which we could use
a few days ago and the cooler is
designed in a way that the radiator can
be mounted in any orientation
according to reeben rather than the
traditional preference of mounting with
the tubes at the bottom this is in some
ways similar to some Aces High coolers
with the cold plate though which is also
convex like some of a attacks and so the
heat transfer and contact should be
better on a CPU IHS reven is using all
aluminum parts here which we've
previously found to have minimal impact
in some cooling loops depending on the
size and the fan spec and the fans are
more likely to have an impact in a
meaningful way
anyway the reven unit uses higher
airflow fans and we'll see if we can get
our hands on testing this one at some
point in the future EVGA also showed its
new FTW silent or ultra silenced excuse
me
cooler today which is effectively an AC
X 3.0 cooler that's three slot it's two
and a half slot for the cooler but
they've just gone ahead and taken all
three for the expansion slot cover which
makes sense might as well support the
card with it if you're going to use it
anyway so this is an ACX cooler with
more mass the extra aluminum mass should
help EVGA in competing especially noise
normalized with some of their 2.5 slot
competition like the Strix and some of
the MSI cards where EVGA has fallen a
bit behind specifically because they've
had to slot designs that extra point
five adds a lot of aluminum mass and
that'll help them out there also help
them keep lower fan noise by way of
lowering the fan rpm because he just let
the sink take care of most of the heat
so we'll see how that goes it's
going to be $500 wish for a 1070 TI is a
bit steep you're kind of getting into
1080 territory there so kinda hard to
justify depending on what you're 1080
options are plus $20 over that but
either way that will probably start
coming to other end video products from
EVGA in the future even if it's volta
but we'd expect to see that continued
this one just sort of an interesting and
fun story so Samson and KDDI tested a 5g
wireless performance on a 60 mile per
hour train pretty close to Tokyo and
this was over a 1 mile distance for the
test
so while traveling 60 miles per hour the
train there the the wireless device on
the train was able to successfully
transfer at peak rates of 1.7 gigabits
per second which is faster than most
home internet at least in the u.s.
anyway so yeah pretty cool be great if
we had that here that we'd also need
trains that could have passed first I
guess so that's that's what they're
working on that was done through Samsung
5g routers and radios that they had
positioned along the track and is a
continuation of their infrastructure
rollout in Asia final item here sales
for the week these are still going on
some things are pretty good actually the
gigabyte gaming case seven I'll point
out first this is an X 370 Rison
motherboard which is noteworthy because
rise ins been on massive sales for the
last few weeks now last two weeks or so
so those continue the motherboard is on
sale for seven days six from the posting
of this video it's a hundred and sixty
dollars marked down from 210 this is
actually a sale not like a markup and
then pull it down and this in our am for
best overclocking boards roundup was the
winner for builds woods overall favorite
just in terms of price performance and
overclocking capabilities it's got a
clock gen all that stuff and the heats
the VR I'm is pretty good heat sinks
decent so that'd be a good pick up if
you're into heavier overclocking on
Rison obviously you can go cheaper but
if you want something that's good and
that is objectively going to be a good
high overclocker that's the board we've
kind of
recommending lately for high-end Raisa
no sees some monitors as well the dell
ultrasharp currently $300 for the the
1440p ultra sharp that's an IPS display
25 inches 6 millisecond and this is a
monitor that focuses more on color
accuracy and as more interesting for
professionals obviously you get a 4k
gaming monitor or something like that
for about the same price right now and
that would be something like the LG 27
mu v 8p - be actual link below so you
not to memorize that 27-inch 4k display
5 milliseconds and free sync and the
thing I like about this monitor is the
tilt swivel pivot and height adjustment
on the stand so this is I'm pretty picky
about this with our monitors that we
have where it's nice if you can rotate
it so you could for example display code
or something like that but so those are
decent pickups that's 400 right now but
it probably will end I don't know
sometimes assume there's a million
monitors that go on display around the
holidays there so note where you can
miss it but yeah there will be a link
below along with all the articles the
biggest thing for us to keep an eye on
right now is going to be the am the rx 5
60 equals 460 story so hopefully we get
a response from Andy that's official
we've given them at this point most of a
day basically a whole day to respond so
when they do check below as soon as you
