completely revisited and overhauled our
ATX testing methodology and applied it
to I TX cases and small form-factor
cases this includes a new test
approaches and charts and new data
including thermocouple Long's BRM
temperatures our ITX reviews start with
a mini roundup of just three cases and
this is meant just to kick-start the
charts and will soon add more cases to
the list including a few that are under
NDA presently today we're benchmarking
and many reviewing the cryo rig Taku and
RT $300 box the Box he Thermaltake Kor
v1 and the true to form silverstone SG
13 before that this video is brought to
you by Thermal Grizzlies high end
thermal paste and liquid metal Thermal
Grizzlies cryo knot is an affordable
high quality thermal compound that
doesn't face some of the aging
limitations of other pastes on the
market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted tests by a tube at the link
in the description below these are the
three cases we're working with today the
interesting thing with ITX reviews is
that actually from a review standpoint
they're harder to work with than ATX
cases with ITX cases you're looking at
things that are partially subjective
like what's your cutoff for how big it
is in terms of volume the SG 13 is the
smallest of these three but the v1 isn't
that much worse although it is 2 times
the volume roughly so you kind of have a
cut-off that's a personal thing where
this might be acceptable for someone it
might be way too big for someone else
but it's still kind of a smallish box
that would go in a home theater
environment so those definitions
notwithstanding other things to consider
with these small form-factor PC cases is
stuff like full-length video cards
support all of these support full-length
video cards to most extent at least to
the extent of reference full-length
cards they also support in varying
capacities
air cooler is liquid cool
tower cooler and so forth the Taku
clearly not a fan of a tower cooler or a
taller cooler but you can fit a small 50
millimeter cooler in there or something
like that that's g13 you can easily fit
a liquid cooler in it just like a 120
levy one could actually fit some of
these smaller mini tower coolers so when
you're looking at all those things it
makes ITX case reviews the least
possible scientific review although we
can still control for as many variables
as possible the fact of the matter is if
we test with the same standardized
hardware with everything which we always
do you run into issues we're on a case
that can clearly fit more hardware like
that one which can fit a larger cooler
you'll see the worst results if
constrained to the coolers that were
selected for smaller cases so keep that
in mind but we can still do a
standardized test which well at least
give us a baseline for the hardware
rehab which is a downdraft cooler and
we'll have the full test bench and
methodology linked in the article in
description below you want to learn more
about that but things we've added this
time that are pretty important one of
them is we're now mounting it we have a
fixed thermocouple on one of the MOSFETs
so this is really just to see does a hot
spot get generated in a particular ITX
case where the MOSFET sits that we've
probes and then we also have new testing
where we're just showing the frequency
over time so we can look at these three
cases for GPU frequency over time and
look at what's the actual frequency
degradation not just is it throttling
yes or no but how much is it throttling
and we'll have a couple new charts for
that as well and we're trying to get
into noise normalize testing that still
kind of being refined right now we've
done it for our CPU coolers it's a lot
harder to deal with ITX cases for
reasons that will be listed in the
article so anyway today these are the
three cases we're adding more rapidly
check back soon for those the talk is
$300 the HG 13s we added an extra fan to
it because it comes with none so that
puts it's effective price at fifty five
and a quarter v1 is a forty eight dollar
case comes with a two hundred millimeter
front fan and that's it for that one
although it does have a space for more
so we can go through all these but first
off case dimensions are probably the
most important for ITX cases when you're
selecting one for our three cases today
the
I already talked you matters that 25.1
meters or 14.8 if you don't count the
legs the core v1 at twenty two point
seven liters and the SG thirteen at an
impressive eleven point five liters just
volume you can fit two SG 13s in the
other cases if you're able to strip it
down to bare components basically and
let it sit there so that's certainly a
put Silverstone an interesting place
where they're the smallest by
significant margin so they're thermals
could be worse but also it's got a mesh
front makes it really interesting to
find out and we can also go through the
cases one by one before getting to the
thermal results we'll start with the
talking for that the first case we
tested was also the most different from
the rest of the group the cryo rec tofu
is a flat horizontal mini ITX monitor
stand as they call it the talkers
quality can be neatly divided into two
aspects outside and inside externally
the Taku is artsy and presentable
constructed of thick unpainted aluminum
with sturdy wooden legs that seem to
make a statement and the statement is
I'm rich because it's $300 the faceplate
is blank white plastic with only a large
circular power button backed by a soft
white power LED and a less pleasant
harddrive led but that can be unplugged
it's red the ventilation holes are
symmetrical and mostly invisible from
the front and that's also the angle from
which you're most likely to see it so
from a visual standpoint they're going
for a very specific home theater look
for an MIT X case the Taku is large
including the empty air between the legs
the volume of the space taken up is
approximately equal to a normal tower
laid on its slide an ATX tower at that
that could help with GPU air flow we'll
test this later but it also means that
despite being shaped like a VHS player
the Taku probably won't fit in an
entertainment center without removing
those legs and when used as a monitor
stand it might lift the display
uncomfortably high depending on what
you're going for and your home theater
setup cryo rigs website does
specifically advertise the Taku as quote
an ITX monitor stand and the outer
construction is definitely solid enough
to support a modern display there are
important ventilation holes on top of
the case however
so covering them up with the stand of a
monitor is a bad idea just be careful
about that if you could go with a
wall-mount it might be better as we're
internal is the most striking feature of
the talk was the sliding drawer which
allows the entire system to be slid out
a few inches on the tray for easy access
sort of like the BitFenix portal the
drawer solution does allow for opening
the case without moving the monitor off
the top but the mechanism is elaborate
and seems delicate compared to regular
lashes and thumb screws draw our ideas
cool it just we need to see a more
robust system that doesn't waste
precious space like a removable panel or
a hinged lid space is limited by nesting
everything inside of the drawer rather
than just attaching components directly
to the outer shell which is another
potential downside of that design the
wide flat layout of the taco isn't
naturally suited to PC components
everything is cramped despite the size
of the case our CPU cooler only measures
47 millimeters tall from the cold plate
to the top of the fan but it was still
uncomfortably close for airflow purposes
- touching the case filters the power
supply is positioned as far as possible
from the 24 pin ATX connector on our
motherboard and although cry rig did
include an extension cable there's no
logical path for routing it the intended
path is under a metal bar at the bottom
of the case but there's no space around
the edges of the board and crossing
cables over the top of the board would
interfere with CPU fat we threaded it
through the SSD cage instead which
limited us to a single SSD the single 90
millimeter fan included with the case
and there's only one for it is mounted
on top of the SSD cage SSDs don't need
direct cooling certainly not like that
and there's more support needed in the
GP or the CPU the error that flows off
the SSD isn't directed at the
motherboard either it would be blocked
by RAM if it were and the fan placement
seems to be more of a matter of where
can we fit a fan rather than where would
it help to have a fan we have a lot more
thoughts on this case but check the
written review linked in the description
below for more reading on those thoughts
moving on to thermal takes core v1 this
is one of the older ITX cases that's
still sold the v1 takes a relaxed
approach the space-saving that's almost
exactly twice the volume of SG 13 and
that offers a few advantages it's also
bigger which is counterintuitive to the
point of ITX whether or not the size
increase is accessible though will
depend on where you plan to place the
system the interior of the v1 is divided
into
two sections by the horizontal
motherboard tray and this gives room for
the PSU chamber below cable management
is excellent and trivially done and none
of the power supply cables have to
stretch too far they can be routed over
the two edges of the motherboard for
easy access to everything except for our
CPU power socket because it's a cube the
four side panels of the case are
interchangeable one is acrylic to are
vents and one is clearly intended as a
bottom panel with for plastic legs and a
PSU filter since every panel is
interchangeable any side of the case
could be made the new bottom so you
could actually change any of these the
top panel currently has acrylic in it we
found there were some interesting
thermal implications with our downdraft
cooler obviously we move that to the
side and put mesh on the top you could
also do that and just move where the
feet are so now we can move the feet to
the bottom one and suddenly you have a
very interesting and unique inverted PC
so that's something to note it's it's
probably the most it's the simplest
possible design element where it seems
like they went with the square
interchangeable panels out of ease and
cost and then later could have gone wait
a minute that's a really good marketing
point so the v1 is interesting for that
reason material quality is fine for the
price it's certainly not impressive the
taco is far and away the best material
in build quality it's also $300 it's a
big difference there let's get into the
SG 13 for the last one the SG 13 is a
low cost bare-bones silverstone case
from the good old days when they put
mesh front panels on everything it
launched in 2015 but we hadn't actually
worked on it until now the SG 13b has
all the features we liked from the RL
0-6 a focus on air flow primarily a
functional design and nothing extra to
raise the price not even a fan there's
not much to look at on the outside just
a metal box to put a computer in there's
some indentations on the front mesh that
probably helps to prevent flexing and
there are two intentional larger
indentations in the top mesh that don't
prevent flexing at all and make the case
look like it's warped the outer shell is
made a very thin steel that hooks into
the chassis with metal tabs that don't
seem to want to line up correctly at the
same time on the bottom of the case
there are four very nice grippy rubber
feet that make the case
charmingly bouncy we actually really
like the selection of the rubber feet on
this case by Silverstone it's got a good
overall feel to it and it does actually
kind of bounce in an interesting way but
the case itself there's no bottom intake
or anything so that elevation does
nothing for you it's a very plain case -
flat metal bottom so it's really just to
get it off the ground a bit doesn't help
with ventilation or cooling cooling
intake exhaust are very interesting on
this one because what you're left with
is a front-end take clearly this side
has a mesh and that's where your video
card will pull air from outside the case
in so that's an intake for our set up
the top is an intake because we have a
downdraft cooler and then this side is
slightly obstructive so you end up with
a lot of the exhaust going out through
the i/o of the case and we don't put an
IO shield on so that actually pobably
helps a bit in this scenario it's
basically when you're planning a build
in a case like this one this is an
instance we're testing with a
standardized bench although perfect for
what we're doing is not something you'd
want to do and really use case scenario
you'd probably want to go with something
like a 120 or 140 CLC just because then
you can direct your airflow a bit better
even though we've still got really good
results on this one as you'll see
momentarily so there's not much to look
at on the outside with it kill
management is unfortunately non-existent
even the reference photos and
Silverstone zone manual show a big wad
of cables that barely avoids snagging on
the fans in the front that's the nature
though of having a case that's half the
volume of anything else on this table
it's the smallest by far there's a
sacrifice and it's cables so we're still
gets full credit for nap not sacrificing
on GPU lengths you can put basically a
full length card in here you can put a
CLC in here and that's pretty damn good
for a case of this size for 40 bucks
then you buy a fan obviously if you
don't have a CLC and call it a day so
get into thermals and noise here
Silverstone's case basically took the
approach of trying to be true to form to
SFF thermal tanks is the next closest it
is a small issue ox you can hide it in a
media centre if you want to but it's
significantly larger and then the taku
is an artsy approach I
and it's gonna soften thermally for that
but also nothing else looks quite like
it or functions quite like it you pay
for that
as previously results for these tests
are not comparable to our other case
tests our ITX test bench is 100%
different components including new
components from gigabyte and enter Mac's
were the sponsors of this particular
test bench where animatics provided the
sfx power supply gigabyte provided the
video card and motherboard and you can
learn more about the methodology in the
article below we're starting with our 3d
mark firestrike test which is a gaming
stand in benchmarks that generates a
realistic load above the CV of the GPU
remember we're just starting on ITX
review so these charts are sparse CVA
temperatures across the board are
acceptable for this configuration the
silverstone actually 13 is the lead
before right now keeping the GPU at 50
point one degrees over ambient this is
well below throttle territory and is
actually good even when compared to ATX
cases in some instances the front intake
fan on the HD 13 helps tremendously here
and the Thermaltake core v1 operates
about four degrees warmer at 54 point
one degrees over ambient which is also
acceptable the cryo rec Taku is pushing
it it's running a 61-degree delta T over
a mids after accounting for ambient
temperature that puts us right against a
major thermal limitation with a GPU
boost 3.0 and our actual diode
temperatures closer to 83 with throttled
territory at 84 so we're actually
dropping clocks here in fact this
frequency over time chart shows that
you'll see that the SP 13 maintains an
average clock of about 1780 to 1800
megahertz whereas the talk is closer to
1740 to 70 and 60 megahertz with some
dips down to 1670 megahertz
that's not a lot you're talking about
single-digit fps differences but it's
certainly a demonstration of how
thermals impact performance next up
blender performance with CB rendering is
also helpful for looking at vrm thermals
which will look at momentarily for CPU
thermals first both SP 13 and core v1
operated at equivalents within error
margins both cases are at about 48
degrees over ambient for the CPU the GPU
which is unused here is also within the
error margins for the differences the
cryo reg taku isn't throttling or
performing in a way that drastically
affects performance but it certainly
could be better the GPU which is idle
during this test is still operating at
16 degrees above ambient that's
impressively lacking in cooling and
performance because again it's not even
being used it's not hurting anything but
it speaks of the design of
chassis the CB operates about five
degrees warmer than the thermal taken
and silver some cases performance isn't
great but it's fine considering this
test is relatively lightweight on total
system thermal strain doing okay overall
theorem thermals during blender gives us
another metric to consider but doesn't
reveal any serious design flaws the SG
13 and v1 are both operating at about 34
degrees over ambient for the hotspot
MOSFET or about 35 with SOC VRM taku
there's about 40 over ambient for
perspective in order for even the takis
measurement to really matter you'd have
to have a room ambient temperature of
something like 60 or 70 degrees and
basically the water in your body would
start boiling before you even had
catastrophic failure with these MOSFETs
although interesting this load is an
intensive enough to matter for this
measurement GPU rendering with blender
produces a lineup with SD 13 and the
lead have 32 degrees over at the core v1
position two degrees warmer it's hockey
nearing 40 degrees torture testing
there's a little abusive on these small
boxes we run power viruses on both
components simultaneously in an absolute
worst case thermal testing scenario the
Taku has its drawer opened for basically
an open-air test bench baseline and we
see that it performs best naturally this
gives us an idea for the kind of
impedance that these cases are causing
resulting in obstructed airflow in a few
instances like the Taku the taco
establishes a baseline of fifty four
point seven degrees over ambient for
unobstructed air flow an improvement of
13 degrees over the stock Taku sixty
seven point five degree result the
Silverstone actually 13 tested at sixty
five point six degrees with removal of
its filter improving performance by
about three degrees the fact that
Silverstone's filter only impacts
performance to this minimal level is
noteworthy as well worth keeping the
filter in place the thermal take core b1
tested with the acrylic window in the
top position already at 69 degrees this
was the worst performer technically but
is only in this configuration where the
top panel is completely blocked off
given that we're using a downdraft
cooler that result makes sense shifting
the acrylic to the other side and
putting mesh on the top we dropped down
to sixty six point seven degrees
comfortably between the SG 13 and the
taku theorem thermals under this torture
test are a bit higher than previous
tortures but still uneventful overall
that's a good thing to be fair it's just
not very exciting open air in the talk
of the drawer open a beak or vrm
thermals loaded to about 30
degrees over ambient with SOC thermals
at 40 degrees the stock Taku ran
significantly warmer about 12 degrees
warmer at 50 degrees Celsius over
ambient vcore or 56 for vsoc but they're
gonna take core v1 ran warmest of all
thanks to the top mounted acrylic but
we're still fine the mesh top v1 dropped
thermals by 2 to 3 degrees under the
acrylic top 2 v1 and the Silverstone's
SG 13 was the most impressive with a
baseline V core load temperature of 46
degrees just eight degrees above the
open air test GPA torture thermals are a
bit more varied and established the SG
13 and a minor lead over the core v1 and
a dominating lead over the Taku the Taku
holds a lead at one left open which
isn't really much of a taki to test it's
more of an open air test bench noise
normalize testing establishes the SP 13
and core v1 as near each other in
performance with a CPU cooler configured
to 80% we actually had to run the Taku
with a CV cooler at 90% and decrease the
intake fan because it was so thermally
choked on both CPU and GPU components
that it restricted the test conditions
so that one sort of failed this test and
that's the start of our ITX case reviews
we have a lot more coming we're probably
gonna try and focus on some of the more
performance focused ITX cases to start
with stuff like this or this one because
they're the most comparable across
charts the Taku although it looks bad in
some of those thermal tests it's also
not really meant to be a performance
case it's basically a rich media centre
case where you kind of want something
that fits your high-end living room with
your high-end TV and your high-end
friends you have a lot of money and
drive fancy Audi's and BMWs that's who
the talk was meant for so although we
could criticize its design in a lot of
ways and clearly have it's also hard to
really fault it super hard for the
thermal conditions because it's just not
trying to do that and if you don't use a
system that was you know 1070 TI
something like that 1070 1080
something that class of GPU and maybe a
lower power CPU you'd be ok but if
you're planning to get the Taku and a
high-end graphics card which you could
afford
clearly because you're spending $300 on
the case you might have a problem and
we'd suggest with the talk you that you
may want to
consider going with replacing the small
fan they have here with something higher
rpm if you can find it and absolutely do
not put a TV stand on top of any
ventilation on the top that'll be a
problem that's the biggest design flaw
the drawers are okay it's just I mean
it's it's kind of neat but really how
many times you need to do that takes a
lot of space it definitely costs a lot
of money so that seems like something
that could go in favor of just I don't
know maybe lifting up the top and
building in the system normally be able
to reduce the size overall reduce the
cost and maybe even improve thermals in
some instances the v1 is the most
versatile it's the ease of use winter it
was the easiest to build in this one
it's got the most cable management space
but it's not that small it is small ish
but it's not as small as the actually 13
depending on what you're looking for if
that size is acceptable for you we've
liked it more or less since the case
came out it's a fine case it's one of
the better ones that thermal takes made
in recent years the SG 13 is also a fine
gaze but it's a lot harder to work in it
has way less cable management space it
potentially has some thermally
constrained scenarios but performed
exceptionally well better than that one
and most of our tests so even though it
can be constrained depending on how you
