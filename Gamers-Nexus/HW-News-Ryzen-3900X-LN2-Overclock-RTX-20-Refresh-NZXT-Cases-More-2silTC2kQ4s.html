recap for this one we're recapping the
rest of the coverage from combi Tax 2019
stuff that didn't make it into
standalone videos and also some side
discussions we had with various
manufacturers and the partners of those
manufacturers including some information
on AMD and its 16 core and then
information on overclocking horizon 3000
series further discussion on the 20
series and GeForce super and a bunch of
cases and other smaller products that
were pretty cool from coffee tax 2019
before that this video is brought to you
by the gigabyte z 390 ARS master
motherboard which comes equipped with
one of the more powerful z3 90 V RMS for
heavier overclocks on the new 9th Gen
Intel CPUs the ARS master is also one of
the few motherboards with a really
heatsink this generation featuring a mix
of high surface area fins and looks
oriented cover blocks oh and it's also
got updated RDV illumination learn more
at the link below
first news item for the show AMD
indirectly confirms the 16 core but we
also have confirmation from basically
everyone so we've been talking about 16
core the whole week and people are
basically wondering where was it at the
keynote it's just it's not ready yet but
what we can tell you is that we had a
conversation with Andy and had a pretty
pretty good misspeak at that during that
conversation which was you know this
platform started with a four core CPU
and we've now quadrupled it four times
four is 16 so half-life 3 confirmed I
guess but anyway that's AMD's indirect
confirmation what we know for for
additional facts though is that all of
the motherboard manufacturers we've
spoken with do have 16 core parts like
all of them have told us that so it's
just a matter of one this launches it
won't launch probably in the July 7th
window so that's why we haven't heard
about it yet I think there are some
birds that are angry we're filming here
cut to the shot from earlier in the week
I guess of the birds there's a lot of
birds anyway so July 7 probably not
gonna be the 16 core launch but we'll
see it's possible it's just that more
likely this happens end of year and you
might be holding some chips because it
needs them for other things like epic or
they're just simply not ready yet and
Rison 3000 series in overclocking we
spoke with some extreme overclockers and
i've learned that some of them have
pushed the rise in 3000 series 12 core
CPU approaching 6 gigahertz on Ellen 2
this isn't particularly useful
information because you're probably not
gonna be running on Alan 2 but it does
tell us the upper bound of these early
engineering samples and just what people
have managed to do and maybe a limited
amount of time of playing around with
the parts so we'll see those numbers go
up as we did with the most recent rise
in 2000 series it's just a matter of
time and getting final parts we've heard
some numbers for air overclocking for
closed-loop liquid cooler overclocking
but this time we're not going to share
those because it's it's not close enough
to launch and we aren't sure how
accurately they'll reflects the final
product so no point in putting them out
there right now because it just it might
end up being inaccurate when the product
comes out but close to 6 gigahertz so
far on the horizon 3000 series parts is
pretty cool information and it'll
probably be higher than that as things
mature 20 series and TI refreshes and
video will be refreshed in some of its
cards later this year with TI options
the 2070 is one of them to likely be
refreshed and the 2060 is on the roster
as well this is just based on
information we pics about the show we're
not 100% positive on what GeForce super
is at present it was the teaser that
Nvidia put out and we're not sure if
it's related to the TI refreshes but we
do know that there's a memory pre
overclocked in the pipes as well for the
20 series so you may end up seeing some
higher frequency memory on on the boards
coming out for updates I kind of like we
saw with 9 gigabit per second versus a
gigabyte per second before that nothing
super exciting though oh that was pretty
good
nothing super exciting super lame as
Deborah called it Intel calls it quits
with skylake x and the h EDT line or at
least on them Intel sending some of its
guy like X models into the sunset this
is presumably to make room for the
glacier Lake X series of processors that
Intel debuted at Computex 2019 the
details so far our scant outside of the
fact that it's going to exist and that's
official information from Intel coming
out in the fall but what we know is like
Blake is expected to see the turbo max
span more than two cores this time and
there will be improved memory
performance as well as for skylake acts
the following SKUs are receiving end of
life status the 79 6 TX 79401 is 100 X 7
8 20 X and these 7800 X the 79 ad XE is
missing from this list so that one's
probably fine for now final orders are
being taken up until December 27th and
the final orders will ship on June 5th
2020 NZXT refresh is also at Computex
2019 was NZXT which unveiled its
refreshed H series of cases as well as
debuting a new premium age 510 elite
chassis the H series most notably
includes an updated front panel i/o
which now brings USB 3.1 type C gen 2
ports to the following models the HT -
10 - 10 I 510 510 i 7 10 sometimes I the
I models will also get an updated v2 cam
power controller or the smart device as
NZXT calls it we did not like it when it
originally came out but it's supposed to
have some updates there's also
integrated at mounting trays for SSDs
and brackets for vertical GPU mounting
moving on to the h5 10 elite NZXT sees
new case uses tempered glass for the
front and the side panels and the front
io panel also includes the new USB 3.1
type C gen 2 connectivity
h5 10 elite also ships with two air RGB
fans and one RGB LED strip there's also
an integrated vertical GPU amount and a
removable radiator or fan tray and the
h5 10 elite has an MSRP of $170 and an
estimated July availability revised H
series will also be available early July
with the h2 10 at $90 to 10 I at 125
1085 10 I at 110 710 at $170 and 710 I
at $200 NZXT also noted to press that
these prices reflect the new US tariffs
that the US government has put in place
which is apparently impacting pricing by
as much as 30 dollars on the 710 I a
shoe store has two new NASA's that were
present at the event and they are
targeted specifically or at least we're
demoing running games off of them to a
host system the NA series goes by Nimbus
store for the name and it's made with
both to Bay and for Bay options with two
to
five G or 2.5 gigabit per second the
rj45 ports a c-store says the NIMH bus
tour two runs a dual-core j-4000 5 2
gigahertz CPU with the 4 nameís store
for using a quad-core J 4105 1.5
gigahertz CPU they boost in 2.7
gigahertz for dual-core and 2.5 with the
quad-core model and part of the
marketing again as that lean asses were
at Computex showing a demo of running
games from our host system so in theory
it's a low enough access latency to SSDs
in the NASS over the higher speed
internal network connection that you
should be able to do that but we haven't
tested that it was on demo the booth
though bike ski or how every big ski
bike skeet we're gonna go with bike ski
bikes east booth it was filled with
wall-to-wall with open-loop liquid
cooling components there were a lot of
them we sent a team over to capture
shots of the new fittings tubes and
meters at what turned out to be an
overwhelming amount of new hardware
there are blue red gold black silver and
white fittings of various sizes and
angles including V fittings and T
junctions and hard tubing solutions that
are similarly covered bikes key is also
working on OLED thermometers which often
have questionable accuracy we're honest
but they can look good in the right loop
the monitors were adjacent to the
pressure gauges with a pressure
sensitive probe for real-time read back
of internal loop pressure and this could
be useful for quickly gauging how loop
changes impact water pressure or for
determining if the loop has gotten too
long we wouldn't use something like this
for the level of accuracy that a review
needs so these are typically not hyper
accurate but they might be OK for quick
spot checks it just depends on the
probes they're using or okay for just
books frankly and the same body does
come with a flow meter as well
new water blocks were also present for
CPUs including thread Riperton h EDT
Intel now including on block displays
for temperature and fittings release
this year with prices in the u.s. TBD as
is a case manufacturer that you probably
not hear about a lot but they
manufacture a lot of cases semi custom
for other companies that you know about
like cyber power for instance azza has a
pyramid case name is still in the works
but that's what they're calling it for
now it's supposed to be between $200 and
$300 depending on tariffs apparently
which is
quite an increase for a tariff that's
not 50% so not exactly sure where that
number is coming from but that's the
range aluminum for the paneling with
glass other than that it's a bottom to
top setup for air flow in Aza's ideal
configuration and then the bottom is
spaced a few inches off the ground for
better access to air they're three 120
millimeter bottom intake fans and then
at one 120 in the top four exhaust sort
of towards the top of the pyramid and
the air goes straight up around a
motherboard tray which is mounted
centrally it's supposed to also include
a table in September as a separate buy
if you wanted to flip the case upside
down for some reason be quiet and its
budget cases so be quiet got a pure bass
500 that was at the show it's supposed
to be about $70 and the fans are there
be quiet fans as they have been in the
past it's got chamfered edges on the top
side of the front panel and then
ventilation on the sides of the front
that looks to be a bit thicker than what
we've seen from be quite in the past but
we'll have to get in the lab and
actually measure it to know the final
specs on it September 2019 for the
launch of that and then finally
Coolermaster for the show in our
rapid-fire news format Coolermaster has
a new power supply that it presently
calls projects fanless and when we asked
did you come up with that name right now
when I asked you they said no we came up
with it a few days ago the power supply
will be 650 watt baseline and it's
passively cooled without a fan go figure
based on the name but it can be just up
to 1,000 watts if the user adds a fan to
the PSU chassis so it's actually got a
cage and there you can pull it out put a
120 fan in there and if the fan reaches
at least 1500 rpm at the max then the
PCB on the power supply will allow the
power supply to boost up to 1,000 watts
this is an interesting and unique idea
perhaps with limited usefulness in the
real world but is one of the potential
use cases might be if you wanted to buy
a passive power supply first 650 watts
good enough for maybe a small
form-factor build that's supposed to be
quiet and then in the future upgrade for
or pull the power supply out of that
system put it in another one you're
using it long term and run it at a
higher wattage for a higher-end build
but again kind of limited use case there
it's it's an interesting idea and
something that's worth paying attention
to
coolermaster also has a new lightweight
mouse that we didn't talk
during our Coolermaster coverage earlier
this week it's got two models there's a
710 which should weigh about 52 grams
and cost $50 and then there's a 7-eleven
model which has RGB LED isn't always
about 58 grams and cost $60 the mouse is
entirely focused on being lightweight
that's the entirety of the marketing
push on it so if you like the newer
trend and lighter weight mice then this
one might be worth paying attention to
it suppose have a 3389 sensor without
any custom tuning that present from what
we understand so the firmware should be
pretty stock on that one and there's
going to be paracord on the final
version the mouse body is made out of
ABS plastic whether or not you like this
will be extremely suggests subjective
because if you're into ultra lightweight
mice it's probably worth paying
attention to but the downside of
something so light that you hold in your
hand is that it does begin to
potentially feel a bit cheap just
depending on who you are so that's it
for the combi Tex 2019 end of show recap
