surprise when benchmarking the for honor
beta over the last few days the game
makes use of high detailed textures and
relatively complex geometry to
orchestrate what comes across as a
deeply detailed environment even the
animations like running down the stairs
are animated to a point of detail we
don't often see in multiplayer brawlers
today we're benchmarking our Nvidia and
AMD Suites of GPUs in the four honored
beta that was released just for the last
few days before that this coverage is
brought to you by catalyst gaming Mint's

calories and chemicals that traditional

here the usual disclaimer for honor
right now is in beta the game will fully
ship on the 14th so it's really not that
far away most things are probably pretty
final but there's still a few things
that are missing from the game for
example the lower resolution texture
settings so when testing we're basically
limited to high resolution textures that
means we don't have a good idea of how
to gigabyte cards will handle when you
have the ability to reduce the texture
quality further there's the question of
drivers Nvidia presently has some beta
ready drivers for the game for honor but
AMD we did email them they don't have
any ready yet we asked them if they had
a pressed version that would be ready
for this benchmark and the answer was no
not yet they will be ready on day one
launch day and we'll have to revisit at
that time to see how their drivers
improve performance but for now we're
still testing anyway overall the
performance wasn't bad it's just that
driver tuning may improve some of the
low-end performance in terms of the
frame times that we see here in this
benchmark so keep all of that in mind
the graphics settings and fro on ER are
straightforward the game again is locked
to high texture quality and defaults to
using temporal anti-aliasing for a frame
to frame AAA that reduces shimmering and
marching ants effect and the rest is
your usual mix of geometric detail
dynamic shadows and environment detail
to learn specifically what each setting
does check out our article link to the
description below it has some
definitions of all the settings in the
game for the usual research before doing
the testing we found that the game's
built-in benchmark is really not
reliable it makes the game look a lot
worse than it is in actuality what
benchmarking even with just with bot
matches we see generally the same
performance in a bot match as in a
multiplayer match so that's a good thing
they're very consistent between each
other the maps are all pretty consistent
within a couple FPS of each other and
then the built-in benchmark is just it's
a lot worse and primarily in the frame
time its frame times are lower and it's
also not really built in a way that
you're ever gonna be playing the game
it's effectively a spectator mode that's
on speed so we did not use the built-in
benchmark we used our own which at some
point has played during this video and
you can see it if you wanted to
replicate it we tested in a bot match
but also validated with gameplay and
found performance to be largely
comparable when in and out of combat as
the maps are complex to begin with and
are what's causing most of the
processing drivers used we're 17.1 dot
one for AMD and 378 for nine for nvidia
again for full test methodology check
the link the description below first
here's a brief sample of the games
built-in bench that I was just talking
about versus our own this is with a gtx
1066 gigabyte card just for a baseline
and we'll look at the full chart with
all the other GPUs in a moment but for
now we're seeing a huge performance hit
in the 1.1 percent and 1 percent low
values and averages are also down
overall because the built-in benchmark
doesn't represent real gameplay at all
we're going to stick with our own test
course for the rest 4k is the start of
that 4k is a lot more abusive than lower
resolutions with this game more so than
normally with the GT X 1080 FTW at Full
Tilt's we're seeing an average FPS of 52
with lows close by at 48 and 45 fps the
msi gtx 1070 gaming X operated at 42 FPS
average also with accepted ly time to
lows and the our X 480 isn't really
meant to be a 4k gaming device but we
threw it on here anyway with frame rates
lower than 30 fps as we're seeing here
with the 480 you actually risk being
kicked by multiplayer lobbies because of
Ubisoft's p2p design for networking so
that's kind of an interesting problem
you don't normally face moving on to the
more reasonable 1440p we immediately see
nearly every card on the bench is
capable of an average FPS exceeding 50
aside from the rx 470 and GTX 1050 ti4
gigabyte cards the pack has expectedly
by the GTX 1080 FTW at over 100 FPS
average again with our frame times
tightly packed enough that there's no
noticeable stuttering the same remains
true as we run through the ranks though
for the most part the GTX 1070 is
running at 82 FPS average or about 20%
slower than the 1080 the 1060 gaming x6
gigabyte is at just under 60 FPS average
and the stepping is pretty easy to
follow thus far as about 20 fps between
each of these three devices we next took
the r9 390x at 57 FPS average and then
the RX for 80 gaming acts with roughly
the same performance and these lows are
hurting here but we'll reserve judgment
until the game's promised day zero
quote-unquote release drivers for now
let's highlight all the AMD one percent
and point one percent low frame time
performance issues as possibly related
to unfinished drivers and we'll revisit
when they shift the driver package the
GTX 1063 gigabyte is next on the bench
producing fps noticeably slower than
it's six gigabyte counterpart note that
this is partly because of the increased
clock speed of the gaming X but the low
performance dips are primarily resultant
of the have vram and one removed SM from
the GPU and these new rx 470 post
performance above the 1050 Ti as our
initial 1050 Ti review would lead you to
expect and we're also entering territory
where 1440p is not really necessarily
likely on this hardware anyway so let's
move on to 1080p with 1080p and the same
extreme settings that we've been testing
with the EVGA gtx 1080 FTW is now
capable of running the game with max
settings while sustaining a 144 hertz
refresh compatibility the 1070 gaming X
isn't too far behind again about 17 to
20 percent with a 1060 gaming x6
gigabyte just ahead of the RX 488
gigabyte card again the RX 480 and other
devices from AMD are posting generally
lower frame times that we didn't
visually detect by human means anyway
any serious and jarring stutters until
running on the RX 462 gigabyte card
drivers potentially play a role on this
the r9 390x and our X 480 are
effectively identical on performance
both leading the GTX 1063 gigabyte SC
card this is where we're starting to see
the three vs. six gigabytes pitch
popping up more noticeably the RX 478
runs more than playable and the lows
aren't bad enough to ruin the experience
even the lower and gtx 1050 TI is able
to operate at about 60 FPS average with
a 1050 SC not too far behind this final
chart looks at FPS scaling when using a
mid-range card so that be aggregate data
between the 10 60 and 480 with this data
we're using a baseline of high and
showing the performance percentage
offset from that you lose about 25% of
the performance by going from high to
extreme with these cards but the gains
from high to medium are basically zero
this might change as more texture
resolutions are implemented into the
final version because again we're stuck
on high for now but low is showing a
bigger impact than medium and high we're
seeing dramatically improved performance
but the game does actually look
noticeably it worse so entering the
conclusion let's start by reminding
everyone that this is again an
incomplete title there's going to be
changes for sure to the game itself and
that would include texture resolution
that's the most obvious example and AMD
will launch some drivers they tell us
and Vidya tells us they're improving
their drivers further so that means
things all shift but this provides a
good baseline it won't shift that much
at most we can probably expect some
frame time improvement from AMD
we can expect some differences in the
scallion from low to medium to high
because of the texture resolution but
extreme which is what we tested that
should remain the same and you'll just
have some offset from there by whatever
percentage Andy and NVIDIA improved with
their drivers so we've got a baseline
from the baseline we can see that the
game can be handled pretty well on
really almost anything at 1080p from the
1050 Ti and up from Nvidia or the RX 470
and up from AMD the RX 460 as we stated
with our review of the card is still not
the best value for its competition
the 1050 Ti and 1050 are pretty
competitive there but the RX 470 does
still make more sense than the 1050 Ti
given the price point of the average aiv
partner models the 1050 struggles a
little bit but it's really not bad it
just kind of depends on the workload of
the particular scene that you're
rendering and everything else 1440p is
fine on 10 60s and
four 80s and up and four K does pretty
well on the GTX 1080 but again that's a
gtx 1080 so you would hope so we're
getting about 60fps there that's with
extreme settings basically completely
maxed out other than super sampling and
we're hitting sixty so that's what you
can expect for performance see maybe
some improvements derived from the
drivers as mentioned but we'll revisit
those as necessary once the game
approaches launch as always thank you
for watching patreon link in the post
roll video to help us out directly link
in the description below for the full
test methodology and for the article
about this topic and to subscribe for
more thanks for watching I'll see you
all next time
you know it's really annoying is games
with a prepositional phrase at the
beginning of the title so now I want to
say for honor I have to say for 400</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
