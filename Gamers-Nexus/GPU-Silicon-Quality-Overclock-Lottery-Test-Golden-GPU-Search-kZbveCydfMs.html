silicon lottery are often discussed in
the industry but it's rare for anyone to
have enough sample size to actually
demonstrate what those phrases mean in
practice aside from well maybe Silicon
Lottery the website we asked gigabyte to
loan us as many of a single model of
video card as they could so that we
could demonstrate the frequency variance
card to card at stock the variations in
overclocking Headroom and actual gaming
performance differences from one stock
card to the next this helps to more
definitively strike out the question of
how much silicon quality can impact the
GPS performance particularly again when
stock and also looks at memory
overclocking and range of FPS and gaming
benchmarks with a highly controlled
bench and a ton of test passes per
device finally we can see the theory of
how much one reviewers GPU might vary
from another's or from your own when
running an initial review testing before
that this video is brought to you by
Thermal Grizzlies conduct a not liquid
metal conductor not as what we've used
in all of our liquid metal and delayed
thermal tests capable of dropping TV
thermals significantly and replacing the
stock thermal interface over CPU
thermals don't just allow better over
clocks but also lower noise levels
because the transfer efficiency is
increased the mix of gallium and indium
makes for a thermal conductivity of 73
watts per meter Kelvin outclassing
traditional pastes significantly learn
more at the link in the description
below so this was a pretty exciting
video to work on because it's not common
that you can get so many of one device
at once we borrowed these to make that
clear so a gigabyte has loaned these to
us for this research because this is not
to our knowledge not something that's
been done for GPUs at any meaningful
scale and seven is it's not as many as
we wanted but it's as many as we could
get still pretty good sample size though
and all we're gonna look at is things
like average frequency out of the box
without any overclocking and see where
does that cap out because card to card
each one will have a bit of a different
VF revolt frequency curve and that's
determined by largely by silicon quality
and then from there we can look at
overclocking Headroom and the actual
impact on gaming performance so where
this has been done a lot for CPUs and
looking at CPU overclock in frequency
Headroom
this is a at least to our knowledge
one of the first opportunities to see
this for GPUs in a third-party
environment so pretty fun stuff the
topic idea actually arose from two
things one of them was sort of silly it
was a comment on one of our Xbox
benchmarks ages ago where they it was a
console player who hadn't really seen
our content nor knew who we were and
said that we only had a sample size of
one so the tests were invalid which is I
mean it's just that's not really how it
works with the console but the thought
arose of well okay so with GPUs if you
have a sample size of one how reasonably
can you draw a conclusion of a stock
card just ignoring the overclock inside
of it that's a bit more variable so
we're looking at that partly and then
investigating some of the overclocking
Headroom and largely debunking some of
the concerns about again sample size of
one not being enough for a stock
conclusion or even an overclocked one so
anyway a testing method it's pretty
concrete here we'll define them more in
the article below but this is our
previous test bench from before the
super launch not that it really matters
much it's the same Banshee the way and
using the older games we did more test
passes than typically so we typically do
a minimum of four here in some of the
tests we did up to 15 like with some of
the 3dmark testing we did we also had a
minimum duration of 30 minutes for each
of the frequency tests to allowed the
cards to - so can heat up and reach a
target temperature level and then we
also for overclocking we raised all the
fan speeds to 100% we got the cards -
about the same temperature plus or minus
one degree Celsius or so and overclocked
it until it reached instability and then
we ensured that the overclock would hold
for a couple of hour for about four
hours or so through an overnight test or
during the day test so it's more strict
than our review guidelines where we just
we needed to hold for the duration of
the review so it's bit stricter in that
regard and that gives us a more
realistic look at what a user might
sustain for an overclock rather than
something you just need for testing and
further we've gotten the standard
deviation here run to run in most of
these games down to about 0.1 FPS
average the
under sent loads which are always the
most variable or in most cases down to
about 1.1 FPS average in the 0.1%
deviation so there's still some margin
of error here baked in of course there
always is run to run variance but a lot
of the time and we'll talk about this
more as we get into the numbers the
variance is less than 1 FPS like over an
average of the benchmark so we'll see
numbers like 1 13.5 8 to 1 13.7 7 for
example for a range of of results across
multiple passes also you'll see the last
few digits of the serial number and some
of the charts that was just for us to
internally identify which card is which
when we were doing the testing so let's
get into it we'll start with some of the
frequency stuff that'll be the most
interesting we'll have some game
benchmarks at stock so you can see the
differences if I guess the idea here is
if you buy one or if you're watching
multiple reviewers videos assuming none
of us get a car that's just straight
defective which happened here by the way
we have one then how much range can you
expect from one card to the next stock
so let's get started doing an overtime
frequency chart with this many GPUs
would be impossible to read as you can
see in this quick example because GPU
boost on Nvidia cards means that there's
almost never a flatline it happens but
it's rare it's typically tied to an
unlocked b bios and a very cool GPU like
in the 40s to 60s degrees celsius
typically close to the 40s for the most
part each card will fluctuate based upon
thermal power and voltage limiters and
so we end up with this mess when we plot
so many devices instead we're resorting
to a simpler bar chart with averages
across 1,500 cells of an identical load
scenario we get a much more readable
format with this chart the
out-of-the-box performance establishes a
stock frequency range of about 45 mega
Hertz from top to bottom
we control the ambient temperature and
other variables so this comes down to
actual silicon quality and variance of
the GPU itself for each GPU a vote
frequency table is generated that is
used to establish the frequency stepping
under Nvidia's boost parameters it'll
run out very slightly different voltages
and frequencies and clocks can't dial in
down to say 1 megahertz so you typically
see a range about 10 to 12 megahertz
steps the best GPUs on this list in
terms of the out of the box stock
frequencies are GP is 4 5 and
on the worst is GPU - although will
later show that GPU 3 is actually
defective making it the one that's
really the worst something you'll see in
the game benchmarks but not in the
frequency testing so this is a matter
where they all technically have the same
spec on the side of the box or on the
website so they're all hitting the boost
spec the base spec but this is
additional boosting Headroom based upon
again thermal power and voltage and then
silicon quality being the one we're
looking at today note that the best
stock GPU doesn't mean the best
overclocker and the best overclock iran
air doesn't mean the best overclocker
on liquid nitrogen as kingpin of EVGA
has told us in the past the next chart
shows the maximum overclock for each
card beginning to establish the start of
the silicon lottery demonstration the
maximum stable GPU frequency was on GPU
5 running at an impressive 20 72
megahertz for the 1070 TI the next best
was GPU 4 at 2048 megahertz than GPU 7
at 20 19 megahertz
note that GPU one has a higher stock
frequency than GP 7 but GPU 7 has a
higher overclocked frequency also note
that this is the stable frequency after
a few hours of burnin so it's an
aggressive bin rather than a bin we
would do just for a review duration GPU
3 has some serious issues but they're
deeper than the frequency you're seeing
here GPU one would be disappointing in
the face of GPU 5 as 70 megahertz is
actually beginning to be significant for
benchmark performance perceptually in
terms of gameplay you won't notice much
if anything between the two but it would
show up in the chart
finally for maximum memory overclocking
we ended up stuck around the same as 600
megahertz offset for each set of VRAM GP
is one two and three hit twenty three or
four megahertz with GP is five and six
getting a bit higher landing at 23 52
megahertz for those gb of four manage 24
hundred megahertz impressively and GPU
seven got stuck at a measly 2194
megahertz a definitive worst and a few
notes here - you'd have to multiply this
by 4 to get the effective speed that
might be the number you're more used to
we're showing the actual speeds and
separately these are the frequencies
after we did validation to make sure
they weren't tanking the zero point
low performance with memory errors that
you don't see by just looking at if it's
quote unquote stable in times by for
example so these are also longer burn in
numbers the frequency range tells most
of the story so far for this comparison
but games will help illustrate the rest
knowing now that our stronger performers
in the chart are GP is four and five and
sometimes one in terms of average
frequency over time we can see if any of
those differences correlate with
meaningful benefits that exceed test
variation for the stock performance and
note again these are from our old GP
test bench results as they were attested
before our TX super or Navi came in so
you're not looking at the newest data
but it's just for the 1070 TI is that
we're testing on mass today so it
doesn't really matter for GTA 5 at 1080p
we measured the average results to be
within a range of 1.3 fps of each other
once subtracting out the single outlier
GPU number three is an RMA unit and it
seems there's a good reason that it
wasn't a harm a unit someone actually
had a problem with this one it looks
like this one has a defect in the GPU
despite being from haribol and clock
speed we retested this one three full
times and camp with the same results
every time stripping the outlier the FPS
range is close enough that it's within
test error as for whether the better
performing GPU is correlated with the
higher FPS GP is 1 4 &amp;amp; 5 especially 4 &amp;amp;
5 had the highest stock clock speeds and
these GPS also ended up with the highest
framerate in this game the data
consistency here is excellent to see and
our test to test variance has low
standard deviations so accuracy is good
even though 0.1% lows are within test
error and standard deviation with about
5 test passes per GPU per resolution for
these cards we can see that there's
slight deviation from card to card based
on those earlier clock speeds but it
doesn't amount to much one stock at
1440p the stack remains very similar GPU
5 and 4 tie for first differentiated
only by error margins and 1% loads and
GPU one follows these with GPU 6 next on
the list our top three performers for
clock speed remain the top three for
stock fps predictably and GPU 3 is again
shown to be a defective outlier our
standard deviation is 0.1 FPS average
across
thirty-five test passes 0.5 FPS average
for 1% lows 1.0 5 FPS for these 0.1%
lowest standard deviation and then we
ran these tests at the minimum of two
resolutions sometimes 4k depending on
the game for f1 2018 at 1080p our
results range is 2.7 FPS average with
standard deviation at about 0.3 FPS for
the average 1.6 FPS for 1% lows and 0.6
FPS with 0.1% lows performance at lens
GP is 4 and 5 again at the top with the
next three all roughly tied one for
sentence 0.1% lows are all within test
variation with only GPU 3 standing as an
outlier but at least it's consistent the
top to bottom range here is 2.6 percent
improvement from GB 1 to GPU for and
with an average FPS deviation of 0.1 FPS
thats dead-on for each card 2.6 percent
isn't a huge deal from a consumer
standpoint but it can be a big issue for
reviewers especially if you test one
card for your initial review and maybe
you change it to a different one for a
later revisit it could mess up the data
if you're trying to compare new data
versus old data because the stock
frequency could be different enough that
there's a bit of a percentage change
baked in there that might be all you
would see from a driver change anyway so
if you're trying to test drivers using
two different GPUs test it across maybe
a couple months apart the difference is
from those factors alone could be enough
to overwhelm the difference from a
driver change for example so same reason
it's best to control GPU speed as best
as you can for tests where it needs to
be fixed so that's something to pay
attention to for reference GPU 1 scored
between one hundred and thirteen point
four and one hundred thirteen point
eight FPS average and all tests
extremely consistent GP for scored one
sixteen point five six two one sixteen
point seven seven and all tests also
very consistent and that's the same for
just about all of these GPU three again
being the outlier because it's defective
additionally GPU one was one of the
better three overclockers in 3dmark but
that performance doesn't necessarily
carry one-to-one to every type of
workload as you can see here at 1440p
the test results for f1 2018
show a range of 2.7 FPS average or a
maximum percent increase from bottom to
top of 3% consistently GP is four and
five are at the top of the list
although GPU Wan remains a lower than we
might have expected based on the
previous results far cry 5 at 1080p is
next for this one our range is 105 point
six to seven point eight FPS average
ignoring the obviously broken outlier
bottom the top that's an increase of two
percent or a range of roughly two FPS
average results are all consistent still
for GP is four and five which are tied
and within even the smaller error of
this test they're actually almost
identical and GP is six and two are
within our standard error for these
tests as well 1440p shows almost the
same stack except GP is seven and one
trade places and GP is four and five
trade places this time shadow of the
Tomb Raider is the last actual game
we'll look at for this at 1080p the
range of performance is 1.8 FPS average
total with GP is 4 and 5 remaining
consistent in placement throughout all
of these tests we can see that there's
at least some direct real-world
correlation to the higher average clock
speed in the 3d mark test earlier but
it's not enough of one that you'd ever
really notice without a large sample
size and a highly controlled set of
tests you might start to notice for
overclocking as we showed earlier where
the range is closer to something like 70
megahertz and some of the GPU to GPU
comparisons the only difference on this
chart that a user might actually observe
would be the defective GPU like unit
number 3 the rest are all within average
test variance and less controlled
environments than our own especially at
the end of the day against our sample
size here it wouldn't much matter one
card to the next as long as you don't
get a total limit like GPU number three
which clearly has a defect and shows
good reason for its RMA even if
reviewers got golden samples so to speak
which we have more evidence contrary to
than in support of minimally the stock
performance what would be with an error
of what anyone else would get and
overclocking performance has some range
of course but that's not news to anyone
what is interesting is seeing the range
Illustrated on the same model card where
we scale from 2070 to megahertz at the
high end all the way down to 1954
megahertz which is a massive range and
again same exact model on these not just
the GPU but the video card itself the
skew
is identical so 100 megahertz an
overclocking head room can have an
impact on framerate and definitely on
benchmark scores but if you fall within
the mean say closer to 20 30 megahertz
here it'd be hard to differentiate any
actual perceptual differences versus the
top-end clock even though if you're
benchmarking competitively some terrible
competitive benchmark frequency but if
you were doing it you would see the
difference is there it's just in-game
you would never realize those as a human
player the memory overclock or the 1070
T is also spanned about 300 megahertz
range although this will behave
differently with G DDR 6 and HB m too
clearly so with regard to whether gold
samples exist we already knew that
answer the answer is yes
silicon just works that way some pins
better than others and that's all there
is to it the further question of to what
extent do they exist we have a better
insight on their their silicon from this
generation that overclocks much higher
than these as a further example but this
gives you an idea of the range and also
things like the cane bin card or the
lightning cards wouldn't exist if they
couldn't push the higher frequencies on
those natively so now we can illustrate
to what degree the clocks change even
when stock which is important for
reviewers because if you're a reviewer
and you want to run multiple video cards
for a non GPU test bench then it's
important to control that variable too
because the stock the stock range here
if you're looking at 45 megahertz or so
will definitely start to chip away at
some of the percentage differences in
the scores and that matters you could
have up to a 2% impact just from
changing between these cards not even
counting some of the others where we've
seen up to 5% so that will mostly wrap
it this isn't really a discussion on
review samples although that is an
interesting aspect of it it's more it
meant to look at the consumer higher
sample size although not as much as we
want but still pretty damn good a higher
sample size of cards of what's the range
and as far as the review samples go
while we can tell you that at least for
the most recent two launches from both a
in the end Nvidia and the sent out for
Radeon seven they sent out the chips
that were more on the like sort of the
50 percentile so not great overclockers
they were actually on the
overclockers which is only a in the--
straight-up told us and that was not
because they were trying to send one way
or the other it's because it was early
silicon nvidia for the super launch
didn't check the cards either and we
know that because some people got dead
cards in the mail so they weren't even
necessarily turned on although that much
is normally done so anyway that's it for
this one
pretty cool information if you want to
see us do more of this type of content
with a higher sample size of stuff let
us know what the thin is and if you have
some ideas of what you'd like us to look
at because we can probably talk to the
manufacturers and and get a loaned
amount of that device and and send it
back eventually but it'd be enough to do
the tests thank you for watching
