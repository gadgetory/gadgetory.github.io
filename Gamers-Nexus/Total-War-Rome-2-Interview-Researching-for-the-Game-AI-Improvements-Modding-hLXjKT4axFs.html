nexus donna and we are here with
creative Assembly's james russell who is
a lead designer on rome 2 total war and
today we're going to be talking about
rome 2 and specifically some more
interesting aspects about the game
design philosophy and history of the
game and their research process what can
you tell me about your research
collection how do you do have specific
researchers do your game designers do it
what's up on that front yeah cool so you
know obviously rome 2 is a game set in
history the total series is all about
you know creating a world for you to
explore a world that that kind of sets
the scene we set the scene in a in a
really sort of historically accurate
point in in world history right so so
what we do is we have this starting
position in the game which is absolutely
accurate as absolutely how the world was
right and then it's up to the player to
make their own history so what total war
games are all about is you have a grand
strategy map where you you you you
decide the fate of Nations right you
pick one particular nation to play you
don't have to play as Rome you can play
as any one of Rome's enemies and you
meet you meet your own history from that
point and you know we've got a deep tech
tree you fight these real-time battles
with you know real units that we use by
armies of the period so you know it's a
huge it's a huge world that we need to
create the setting for right so that is
absolutely a lot of research to do but
what we don't do is have a sort of
specialist team that just does research
and then kind of briefs everybody right
it's really important to us that the
that the game designers themselves are
the ones that know about the period is
the game designers themselves that
immerse themselves in in understanding
the the period that we're trying to
portray right because that's the way you
get a really authentic game world so
it's not just the designers it's also
the hot all different areas of the team
so for example you know the animators
have to understand
you know how the Roman army would fight
and how Rome's enemies fight so you know
you have big debates over over you know
whether the Spirit iculous spearmen are
fighting you know under under have with
the spears underhand or over hand and
that kind of thing because they have to
make those decisions and actually create
the animation so we go you know we going
to talk to all the reenactment guys we
going you know do a lot of a lot of
primary research and and we read some of
the sort of you know you know we read
some of the primary sources of you know
descriptions of battles all that kind of
stuff whereas some of the designers you
know the ones that are having to build
the map you know we pour over loads of
ancient world atlases and read accounts
and when we have to understand you know
who's in charge of each particular area
of the world you know some obscure part
of bactria right up near Afghanistan and
we have to understand who's in charge
what characters were around who's the
king who was you know you know what was
what was the Carthaginian Senate like
right we have to understand all this
stuff so we have to we just have to
receive designer responsible for each
parts of the game have to has to do
their research you know the person
designing the economic system has to
understand how the ancient world economy
worked you know where where the
different trade routes were you know the
guy dealing with the naval vessels have
to understand you know who had what
kinds of ships also we have to create
technologies so we have to understand
not just what what people had at the
beginning but what was developed over
the next few hundred years right to
create the tech tree for you to to
actually research there's just a lot of
work but it's great fun to do and one of
the biggest challenges with a game like
Rome is the sheer scope of it so you
know like I said it's not just about
Rome we were trying all these different
barbarian tribes in in Britain in Spain
and
you know ginger in Germany all the way
to the east across you know Russia and
Ukraine and into Afghanistan even there
almost so you know it's a huge world we
also have to research how the city's
looked right so we've got to portray
these massive cities and that's one of
the big new things about the games we
portraying cities in a way that we
haven't done before I mean absolutely
huge you know we're trying to portray
you know eastern cities you know Greco
Roman cities barbarian settlements this
whole range of a whole range of
different different content that's in
the game all these different fighting
styles so we have to look at the
different animations for all these
different tribes these different weapons
that they use this is just a massive
effort it's fantastic fun to do and you
know we create a really epic experience
out of it we're gonna be working on the
game for over two years but we got out
you know over 200 over 100 people
working for to you so that's over 200
kind of man years of work right which is
which is incredible amount of effort and
and and and its way the biggest game
we've ever made in terms of budget I
mean we've spent we were the resources
on this game are you know well over one
and a half times what we put into the
previous game shogun 2 is there anything
in particular that you personally are
excited about what when you saw it in
the game whatever this this this element
was what made you really go wow we did
an awesome job on that well you know
this is a thing I think I think I think
it's a thing that's unique and magical
about total war is that you know you'll
have lots of games that look great when
you're when you're really really close
up okay but what's special about total
war is the spectrum of scale you've got
so you can zoom right in and you can see
you know two guys fighting it out right
then you zoom out a bit you can see that
there's you know 200 of them in a unit
they're all fighting it up and then you
zoom out and you can just see thousands
upon
it's a man right and you just get this
breathtaking spectacle because you know
we have the battles plus we have the
kind of strategic map which is you know
a big kind of forex game in itself you
know so it's almost two huge games in
one and you know absolutely and looking
more the programming side of things on
the inner workings of the game have
there been any major iterations on the
engine which we've really really you
know hugely enhance the graphics change
the lighting systems change the particle
size effect system so it looks
completely you know on a complete
different level from drum even the
previous iteration so you know that I
guess the big thing is that one one of
the really big things to mention is the
fact we've kind of combined you know
land battles with naval battles because
previously we've had land battles and
had naval that was we never had that in
one single battle very cool and on the
mod in front the Total War series has
historically had a pretty open open
engine for modding you could plug into
ini files I understand you have some
tools in the works and have had tools on
Steam Workshop for a while can you tell
us more about that well yeah you know
Shogun's who's got great modding seen
all I previous titles you know it's
really vibrant to see players you know
messing around with the game and and
creating some amazing pretty some
amazing things you know I think that's a
great way to actually sort of start off
becoming a game designer is sort of you
know like actually going you know what
actually I want to change these stats
and I think this unit should be a bit
more powerful that unit should be a bit
faster you're playing around with game
systems like that is I think you know
it's a great way to get in get into the
industry and really understand you know
how how the hell games work but
certainly we think it's fantastic to
have a vibrant modding community they
you know having having multiple games
really increases the longevity of the
game it creates variety allows people to
really have a lot of fun and
and we want to support that as much as
we can so you know we're going to be you
know we are intention is to release more
and more modding tools as you know as we
go along do you have any any final
thoughts for your fans for people who
have been waiting for this game for so
long it's just around the corner
probably by the time this video ends up
it'll be one day away what do you have
to say to your fans well you know if you
see this before the release you've got a
pre-order because you get the Greek
States for free and and that's a writ
that's a really good chunk of content so
you know if you forget your pre-order in
get the great states for free it is it's
a really exciting time for us right
because we've been slaving away making
this game and we're really really you
know excited for when it when it when it
hits hits the guys out there you know
and we get to see all these gamers you
know playing without having fun with it
you know we really really psyched for
that because you know we've been working
on it for so long you know we just we
want to see people at people out there
playing it so it's exciting time for us
we're going to be like glue two screens
on there on release day I think a lot of
us will be glued to our screens i know i
know i'm personally pretty psyched about
it if you're psyched about rome 2 total
