gigabyte arguments for the RX 480 and
I've got the box on the table because we
have our two cards in crossfire testing
this instant
but today we're looking at 4 gigabytes
vs. 8 gigabyte specifically we did this
previously with the gtx 960 nvidia card
testing 2 gigabytes versus 4 gigabytes
the story has changed graphics cards now
have more vram but games are also
demanding more so that's what we're
looking at before getting to the
benchmark this content is brought to you
by Origin PC and a new origin Kronos
which is equipped with the RX 480 and is
customizable and upgradable on their
site including custom paint so getting
into the coverage here first of all we
used our reviewer copy of the rx 480
which performs identically to this I've
validated it the one instance it is
different and it is somewhat important
one for debugging is we are able to
flash our firmware to create a 4
gigabyte rx 480 so that's what I did go
into this benchmark knowing that the one
note that is relevant to that end is
that the memory on 4 gigabyte cards that
you can buy is 7 gigabits per second it
is 8 gigabits per second on the 8
gigabyte card but when we flashed the
firmware I checked and this is good on
AMD for doing this the memory clock was
actually slightly reduced and was
comparable to what you can buy on the
real market so those were variables that
were taken into account and things look
good for the comparison we are not doing
thermals power or noise levels it will
basically be the same as what you see in
our our X 480 review check that if you
want more what we're looking at is all
games and a few things to expect here
with 4 gigabyte vs. 8 gigabyte or really
any disparity in the RAM for video cards
the aspect of games that will stress
that the most will be anti-aliasing
which really heavily eats into vram
potentially that's because taking multi
taps or multiple samples per pixel to
determine what color that pixel should
be so if you have 8x MSAA
also known as 8 tap its sampling each
pixel 8 times that is a lot of
additional sampling and that does impact
B Ram another aspect
would be the post effects side of things
post FX and temporal effects will more
heavily impact the processing side of
the GPU than the vram so if we have a
game that is more heavy on post effects
and computational effects then we might
actually not see that much of a
difference between four gigabytes and
eight gigabytes but let's run through
the charts and then talk about why they
look the way they do let's start with
one of the games where we see a big
difference in performance between four
and eight gigabytes this is Assassin's
Creed syndicate which I'm reviving to
our bench specifically for the test I'm
not even going to show the other video
cards we're just looking at the RX 480
so that's all this video is about we've
configured settings to very high with a
four tab MSA and I've seen fifty-three
FPS average on the eight gigabytes rx
480 which is a 14.5 percent increase
over the 45 point 3 FPS average of the 4
gigabyte card the difference is actually
very noticeable and it's not just
because of the averages it's because of
the low performance so as always with
low-level GPU performance comparison it
is important to look at 1% and 0.1% lo
metrics or low frame times to get the
full picture of things and the 8
gigabyte card although it runs at 53 FPS
average it puts out v 32.3 FPS 0.1% lows
and the 4 gigabyte card falls to just
twenty five point seven fps 0.1% lows or
a twenty five point six eight percent
increase if you move to eight gigabytes
so that is a twenty five point six eight
percent change from four gigabytes to
eight gigabytes on the 0.1% lows and
this is noticeable in play where you
will see more frame tearing on the four
gigabyte card it gets choppier and that
is actually something you feel as a
player the fluidity just isn't quite as
good as on eight gigabytes 1% lows are
also separated by a percent difference
of 25 so 25 percent difference this is
also something we saw when testing the
gtx 960 s on two gigabytes and four
gigabytes where the cards were most
heavily impacted on games like
Assassin's Creed shadow of mordor will
request all the vram you have available
but requesting it and seeing
quote-unquote utilization of GP Z
doesn't mean that's actively engaging
all
that requested vram and tasking or
instructing it we tested the game at
1080p 1440p and 4k with Ultra settings
at 1080p we're seeing results of 78.3
FPS average 41 fps 1% low and 36 FPS
0.1% lows on the rx 488 gigabyte card
drop into 4 gigabytes those numbers
barely change there's a 0.3 fps
difference and the bench pretty much
perfectly executed every time we repeat
the benchmark and we do repeat testing
iterations to be sure so this is a
measurable and real difference and it's
accurate but it's still just 0.3 FPS so
it is imperceptible as a user basically
the same and there's no real advantage
to an extra 4 gigabytes in this game
regardless of resolution Mirror's Edge
catalyst is processing and post FX
intensive but it also used a lot of
texture filtration techniques and using
those techniques does impact B Ram
pretty heavily for our upcoming
crossfire benchmark this will be an
interesting test case to see how
post-processing impacts the crossfire
setup but for now we're still looking at
vram and Mirror's Edge catalyst has some
unique performance results at 1080p
Ultra we see the average FPS between 8
gigabytes and 4 gigabytes is about the
same 70 4.3 FPS versus 72 0.3 FPS it's a
two point seven three percent difference
and even the minimums are good with
mostly identical results between
resolutions at 1440p Ultra we're still
seeing gaps of 1 FPS maximally the
difference between averages is 0.64
percent so negligible but then we look
at 1080p hyper and this increases
texture quality mesh quality other
filtration effects and vram syncing
settings and 1080 hyper produces dismal
stuttering after a few minutes of play
this isn't something you'll see
reflected in a short benchmark period
but if you're playing the game properly
for a bit the vram begins saturating
with resources and frame rates can drop
hard just from this chart we see our
average it looks like 40 FPS versus 53
FPS or a 27.96 percent difference but
the 0.1% lows are even worse down to 18
FPS from 31.3 that's a fifty three point
nine six percent difference these lows
are noticeable as severe
in frame rate output because the frame
times have become inconsistent but
there's more to it than that here's a
results table different from our chart
we ran multiple extra passes on Mirror's
Edge specifically because of this issue
and found that the first few sets of
data were poor in performance but not
completely unplayable after playing for
some time and every single time
thereafter we'd see drops to 12 fps 0.1%
lows and in the 20s for the average
frame rate making some really intense
stuttering and slowing down the game
time overall
so by dropping to four gigabytes we've
gone from a relatively playable
fifty-three FPS average to an unplayable
and fluctuating range of twenty six to
forty seven FPS average GTA 5 was
completely retested on the our X 480
cards for our bench after speaking with
Andy's Scott Watson we received an
unreleased in development driver that
should resolve the previously mentioned
GTA 5 stuttering issues from launch day
the driver update is sixteen point seven
point one and this is the only game in
the test that runs with this driver set
the rest are still on 16.6 dot two or
the press drivers for release day we see
an average FPS of 85.3 on the eight
gigabyte card at 1080p with the four
gigabyte card at 83 FPS that's an
imperceptible but measurable difference
1% lows are also close only three point
three five percent difference and 0.1%
lows are fifty four point three FPS
verses 51 FPS on the eight gigabyte and
four gigabyte options respectively
another imperceptible but measurable
difference 4k in 1440p shows similar
performance results leaving GTA 5 a
title where it doesn't seem to matter
too much whether you get a 4 gigabyte or
8 gigabyte are X 480 that said we're
only testing for single GPUs here and
crossfire may change the story
black ops 3 is another title with mixed
results like Mirror's Edge black ops has
also been an optimized title for us in
the past on these benches and one which
has generally pushed Andy a bit further
up the ranks than some other games on
the bench at 1080p we see at the 8
gigabyte card running at 130 2.3 FPS
average 105 FPS 1% lows and 93 FPS 0.1%
low is all very tightly timed and suited
for 120 Hertz gaming if you want
that and you even gets 144 Hertz with
some tweets moving to four gigabytes our
average frame rate drops by four point
one seven percent to 127 fps and 0.1%
lows dropped by thirteen point nine
eight percent 280 FPS increasing it to
1440p we see more of an impact to those
0.1% lows so previously the difference
was actually pretty large but not
something that you really perceive at
1080p unless you're really hardcore
about 18144
Hertz and at 1440p the eight gigabyte RX
480 is now at 80 3.3 FPS average 60 7.3
1% low 60 1.3 0.1% lows which is
incredibly tightly timed and the average
is only slightly faster than the 4
gigabyte card at 80 fps but the 0.1%
lows on the 4 gigabyte card are twenty
eight point seven percent lower than
eight gigabytes that's almost 30% lower
percent change from eight to four
gigabytes and that means occasional
stutters become visible in gameplay and
that is actually something you can feel
as a player 4k produces similar results
at 41 FPS average for 8 gigabytes 34 for
1% low is 32 for 0.1% lows but on the 4
gigabyte card that changes to a similar
average and 1% low number but a decrease
of 60% on the 0.1% low metrics and now
of course you might say well this isn't
really what I want to play on for black
ops anyway 4k at 40 FPS but if you're
doing setting tweaks then it actually
might become relevant
we tested more games than this like the
division ashes of singularity and others
and you'll find those results in our
article linked below as we found
previously for the 2 gigabyte versus 4
gigabyte gtx 960 testing the differences
are present you can actually see them in
almost every game there is a visible
difference in numbers but not
necessarily in gameplay to the user a
0.3 FPS difference is not something you
care about neither is the difference we
saw in a lot of the games like shadow of
Mordor maybe 1 to 3 FPS stuff like that
is really frankly irrelevant as a user
but there are games where it is actually
a massive difference we saw the 60% gap
and 0.1% lows for black ops at 4k not
really a super
common use case but if you look at more
common use cases we can kind of push
that one aside look at something like
1440p in black ops and we were still
seeing almost 30% reduction in those
numbers and that remained true for other
games as well like Mirror's Edge
catalyst and Assassin's Creed syndicate
another game that has proven to be very
vram dependent in previous tests so it
depends on what you're doing there are
other considerations that matter as well
for example putting two four gigabyte
rx4 80s and crossfire versus two eight
gigabyte ones could have pretty
different results than what we're seeing
here on large anyway we'll see a lot of
the same kind of concepts but it may be
exaggerated if you do crossfire cards
and that's something we're working on
testing as soon as possible but the
reason you would see that difference
would mostly be because you're
increasing sort of the the computational
potential and throughput or maximum
potential throughput of the cards by
doubling them of course not a doubling
exactly of power but we're keeping still
lower vram and we might be exceeding
what the the cards are capable of in
terms of VRAM capacity so we'll look at
that as it comes up as for whether or
not eight gigabytes is worth it for the
our X 480 that really depends it's an
extra $40 on reference from four to
eight gigabytes 200 to 240 dollars and
if you're playing games like black ops
or Mirror's Edge with high settings meet
when I say that I mean hyper settings or
just running the higher texture and
filtration effects or you're playing
games like assassin's creed that series
has historically had this sort of
performance output on these cards it is
definitely better to get the eight
gigabyte card if you are playing the
other games and I'll read the off the
list here we've got ashes of singularity
Talos principle the division Metro last
light shadow of Mordor to some extent
GTA 5 those games see very little impact
from the vram change the impact might be
a few percent at most but it's always a
couple FPS maximally and that's not
super noticeable so those types of games
you can kind of ignore it you should
definitely buy eight gigabytes for games
that are text or heavy anti-aliasing
heavy if or if that's just something you
really like or texture filtration but
otherwise four gigabytes
for the RX where D is an acceptable way
to save $40 if you're kind of in that
lower price category but crossfire maybe
an instance where we need to look more
closely at performance and see if that
changes and we will be doing that soon
one thing for certain these games that
produce the disparity and vram
performance are consistent in their
disparity so we've seen that a few times
now for multiple cards and it's also
time to move away from two gigabyte
cards I know there's not a lot of them
left out there but the the use case is
for two gigabyte cards have closed
especially with the price reduction on
four gigabytes on the whole I would
recommend two gigabytes for a really
cheap home theater PC something that's
not meant to really do a lot of gaming
maybe if it is it's more casual or older
games but generally definitely kind of
start pushing towards that four gigabyte
value because games are drawing more
VRAM there's a lot of reasons for that
that we can discuss and future ask G
ends or something but as always thank
you for watching that pretty much recaps
the difference is totally up to you
whether you want to buy four or eight
but hopefully that data helps you make
that decision patreon link the postal
video if you want to help us out by
supporting the channel and paying for
all this because I did buy this out of
pocket thanks for watching and
subscribing I'll see you all next time
you
let's run through the charts and then
talk about why they look the way they do
with benchmarking music okay so that was
enough time to look at all 20 charts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
