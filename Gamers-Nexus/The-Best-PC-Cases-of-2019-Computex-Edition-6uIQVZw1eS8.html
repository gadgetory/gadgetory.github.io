unobtainable like the $4,000 semi custom
cocoons to questionable like the $40 cut
apart five-gallon buckets with a cloth
on top of them and that was just from
one booth the show had a lot of
promising cases some with mesh and some
just unique and we're looking forward to
the industry's investment into more
performance and quality focused trends
for 2019 for this video we're looking at
the best cases that were at Computex and
we have everything from standard designs
to abstract or straight bizarre
enclosures with a lot of the design
standards shifting toward mesh for this
year's launches before that this video
is brought to you by thermal grizzly and
their high-end thermal compounds thermal
grizzly makes cryo not paste for high
thermal performance and conductivity
without being electrically conductive so
you don't have to worry about shorting
components cryo knot is particularly
good for replacing stock GPU pastes as
cryo knot is a non curing compound learn
more at the link in the description
below as a reminder we still need to
test all the cases displayed at Computex
2019 but this list gives a recap of the
most interesting enclosures we saw at
the show of course until we can test
them properly we'd advise holding on
purchases our our best of show
nomination for this year's cases goes
towards silverstone who've reinvented
their chart-topping raven series with
the raven prototype and the alte which
uses a raven chassis the rv0 2 is among
the top three cases we've ever
benchmarked released originally circa
2009 and its high performance was
primarily results of managing to cram 3
180 millimeter high static pressure fans
pointed straight into the tower and GPU
coolers into the bottom of the case the
alter revisits this design with raven
tooling but now with three 200
millimeter bottom mounted fans instead
Silverstone is also moving to support
the RGB trend in these fans if a bit
delay it on its support of that trend
with further trendy moves illustrated by
the accompaniment of curved tempered
glass for the side panel the altar
rotates and inverts the motherboard tray
positioning the GPU cooler in a
slipstream from the 200 millimeter fans
and enabling tower coolers eight directs
a bottom to top air stream this is
improved with a 120 millimeter top
mounted fan for exhaust this approach
allows Silverstone to keep a closed
front
panel instead orienting its intake
toward the bottom and push it out a fine
mesh filter at the top the PSU is rear
mounted in this one and hidden with
cable management's concealed by a solid
panel on the opposing side price will be
in the range of $300 with a release
target of to be determined it's not
finalized yet Silverstone also had its
Raven prototype present which should be
priced significantly more affordably
while still maintaining the airflow
focus the Raven prototype isn't
completely finalized either but it is
improved beyond what was shown at CES
this is more of a true successor to the
rv0 2 finally Silverstone earned its
spot and best of show by closing out its
stack with a more affordably priced
Farah v1 case the Farah v1 is meant to
sell at $70 it will have a mesh front
and apparently intends to ship with
three 120 mil a RGB front fans and one
120 millimeter exhaust fan will believe
this pricing when we see it but if they
can hold it it's a promising goal and it
would make for a strong successor to the
RL 0-6 the next award is for most
improved which goes to fan text this
year the fantex P 400 a improves upon
the 2016 design for the P 400 by adding
a fine mesh panel to the front this is
similar to the cooler master and our 600
panel in case we recently reviewed in
that the ultrafine approach to the mesh
allows for the size of the mesh holes to
act as a dust filter without needing a
dedicated dose filter the fans XP 400 a
is supposed to carry new fans that are
as yet hum detailed with options of
blackout or RGB at either $70 or $90
respectively the P 400 a is among the
more promising cases we saw it for its
mixture of exterior design and
performance and we look forward to its
release later this year before moving
away from air flow and towards just
unique cases we have a runner-up for the
most improves category fit Phoenix and
its Nova mesh TG land on the list for
this one the last time we worked with
BitFenix the company had released one of
the worst cases we've ever reviewed the
Enzo which was bad in terms of build
quality airflow and ease of installation
features but BitFenix has had some time
to improve the BitFenix anova mesh TG
moves to a fine dust filter on the front
following trends
other companies have discovered this
year although it still includes a dust
filter in the front which is probably
not fully necessary we think that
Phoenix could drop the filter to improve
performance without much sacrifice but
in the very least it's something that
user can remove if the user desires the
case should ship with one 120mm rear fan
with LEDs one 120 front fan with LEDs
and a price of about 70 dollars for the
glass version or $60 for the steel side
panel variants support for radiators
goes up to 360 millimeters in the front
240 on the top and 120 in the rear with
28 millimeters of kale management space
in the back BitFenix with the nova mesh
TG has made a major move back into our
spotlight and we'll make sure to review
this one as soon as we're able to this
is a good move by a company that
otherwise demonstrated some serious
design issues in the Enzo and the ante
up mash has further proven that BitFenix
is serious about fixing its case design
and moving forward with something
competitive not every case has to be
airflow focused of course it just has to
be good enough thermaltake gets noticed
for bringing one of the two most unique
case designs we saw at a Computex
thermal takes was the distro plate 200
or DP 200 Plus which is an acrylic water
cooling distribution plate that has its
own feet and a motherboard tray the
point of the case is throughout water
through the acrylic body using an inlet
and outlet on the motherboard side of
the case for feeding water into the
distribution channels the back has a
fill and a drain port and an LED PCB
although the placement of the LEDs is
still being finalized Thermaltake is
still deciding on several of the
features of the case like if it should
have a glass panel or aluminum bars like
the core p3 does but it's nearing
completion on the design the DP 200 is
unique in its approach to eliminate the
case itself and merge it instead with a
water cooling component and we're
curious to see how it turns out once
finalized price and release date are
still TBD but as far as unique cases go
if you can still call this a case the DP
200 plus definitely deserves its spot on
the list as a runner-up for unique cases
as as pyramid enclosure takes a
different approach to include a design
as a brand you might not know but
they're a common manufacturer for system
integrators like CyberPower and they
regularly make semi custom enclosures
that our partner exclusive for short
periods like 6 months the pyramid is a
flashy case that's seen
to desire a place in the showroom more
than anything else using tempered glass
panels on the four vertical faces and a
centrally mounted system for maximum
visibility to the components the case
uses aluminum panels for the sides and
uses mounting points for fans on the
bottom of the chassis where three 120
millimeter fans were installed for the
show and then there's one additional fan
at the top the point of the pyramid
possesses that extra 120 millimeter
exhaust fan it's not really practical in
any way really nothing about it is it's
larger than it needs to be and the
cooling it's probably perfectly
acceptable but not going to be
particularly good but it can be flat
packed so that's good and it's
absolutely unique and there might even
be a table sold separately to flip the
pyramid upside down because that was
necessary the case should cost between
200 and 300 dollars when it's finalized
this was blamed on tariffs although that
percent change is much greater than the
tariff so we're not sure what they're
doing but it's interesting it's unique
and even if it's impractical it's
something that's worthy of being
highlighted just for being different
NZXT barely made it onto the list this
year but we did want to highlight its
refreshed series of cases as they
address some major past concerns of ours
NZXT it receives the GM Computex award
for most decidedly average assigning
neither praise nor condemnation for the
products announced which really isn't a
bad thing considering how bad some of
the cases were on the show floor when we
reviewed the original NZXT aged 500 not
to be confused with these 17,000 other H
500 skews we found that its negative
pressure stock configuration performed
surprisingly well or at least adequately
for our test system adding fans to
intake actually began to regress and
performance for GPU thermals and that's
because the stock negative pressure
setup drafts Aaron naturally through the
rear PCIe holes by way of the GPU fan
the new H 510 elite has the same panel
design aside from the glass front and
should have the same airflow pathways
and behaviors at least it would with the
fans on the same spot the intake remains
on the right side panel although this
time it appears that NZXT II has
switched to positive pressure setup
depending on the quality of the fans
used this could end up potentially worse
for GPU thermals are better for CPU
thermals at least with our test platform
but we'll look at that when it launches
the case has managed
to update with a glass front USB type-c
to RGB fans and an RGB LED strip it's
the same path that the s340 elite took
for the s 340 this is a predictable move
and one which doesn't make waves
positively or negatively but it's
notable enough to mention pricing should
be $170 of the elite or $80 the h5 10
non elite version if you prefer
something that sticks closer to the
original price we also have a runner-up
for the most decidedly average category
and that's Lian Li with its 11 XL and
similarly predictable but noteworthy
news Lian Li is 11 XL deserves mention
for its up scaled approach to the
popular and jian award-winning xi
dynamic chassis the OU 11 dynamic XL has
more space in the bottom better
accounting for the lower edge of
motherboards while still fitting cooling
components for example and can also now
fit EA TX motherboard small improvements
include optional SSD mounts on the side
intake which we wouldn't particularly
recommend using for air flow reasons but
if you wanted them there there and it
also has pre routed SATA and power
cables for easy connection of SSDs
behind the motherboard tray these allow
for SSDs to connect in a semi hot
swappable manner but it's mostly an ease
of installation feature which is because
at this point Lian Li is refining a case
that was already an award-winning case
cooler master and it's h100 end up in
our category of cases we should keep an
eye on the age 100 worries us in a few
ways like the complete lack of any
bottom ventilation to allow the GPU fan
to take air in from the outside of the
case but it's still an interesting
enclosure and with the push of AP use in
the future hopefully anyway this could
have a good place for a small
form-factor gaming system that might
live in a living room it's a smallish
box sort of similar at the old core v1
by Thermaltake but smaller than that and
it has a 200 millimeter front mounted
fan this alone gets it in the video as
many IT acts with 200 millimeter fans
are a rare combination and one that is
interesting and looks kind of good
despite the mesh front though the power
supply ends up potentially in direct
conflict with CPU intake and the video
card is pushed against a steel panel at
the bottom with lower TDP parts that
should be workable and the more
interesting use case will be when
coolermaster launches its 200 milliliter
radiator to fit in the front of the case
something that they are working
we're not sure how it'll do for
performance but it's certainly worth
keeping an eye on and that's why we're
noting it in this video the case should
be about $70 when it launches there were
a lot more cases at Computex 2019 we
didn't see every single case on the
floor but we saw a lot of them
especially from the bigger brands that
you know and we cut a few from the list
be quiet for example had its new pure
base 500 which is a cheaper finally case
from be quiet and one that might
interest fans of be quiet cases who
don't want to spend as much it just
didn't really fall on a place on this
list and then there were also plenty of
cases from smaller manufacturers or
suppliers even that we just simply
didn't get a chance to see if there's
something you think that we should take
a look at or maybe we missed we didn't
include in this video or in our Computex
coverage please feel free to leave the
name of the products below especially if
it's case and we'll do our best to get
our hands on it as soon as it's
available and post a review we do pay
attention to the comments especially
when a lot of you want us to look at the
same cases so be sure to post those
because we'll actually take a look at
them that's it for this one subscribe
