we're here to recap news for the past
week that includes some more information
on 7900 x and our further testing as we
iterate on the cpu and we'll also be
talking about the Xbox one X some thread
Ripper stuff and a couple of other
things that have happened but overall we
will be starting out with X 299 m7 900 X
because they are a very hot topic right
now before that this content is brought
to you by custom backplate makers at v1
tech comm the u1 tech builds GPU back
plates to order with their online
customization tool making it easy to
theme upcoming PC build that cleats cost
$25 and up and are installed via magnets
and can be seen in some shots of the
cards reviewing that lately used code
gamers Nexus 5 for five dollars off your
order or click the link below starting
out with the 7900 X and X $2.99 stuff so
for our review it was fairly in-depth
but we focused a lot of effort and time
on the streaming stuff and the VR stuff
which means that thermals and power are
being pushed to the next video and that
is getting some good progress at this
point I do have some preliminary
information for you on thermals and
power from our testing not being too
concrete yet this is just a news recap
overall but we also have some more
information on overclocking because as
stated in the video for the review that
data was still coming in as we were
shooting the video against the deadline
so most of the discussion happened in
the charts without much discussion in
the video so let's start with that first
off for overclocking we managed to hit
with our 7900 X 4.5 gigahertz and that
was with a V core of one point two seven
five volts and then for the cooler we
had the CLC at kraken X 62 fans maxed
out pump maxed out so it's an adequate
cooler for pretty much anything normal
but the last couple Intel releases have
not been normal in the thermal Dept as
we discussed in our original 77 100k
review and as seem to become a topic a
little bit after that again for the 7700
K so temperatures we were seeing north
of 90 Celsius with 4.5 gigahertz at one
point two seven five volts and we were
still seeing pretty high thermal
without the overclock as well so that is
something that will get a whole lot of
attention in a separate piece for from
us but that's what we're looking at for
the basics we were able to almost hit
4.6 but it was starting to push into 95c
plus territory where and that's what I'm
saying temperature by the way this is
the package temperature as measured
through software so that's not the core
temperature it's the package temperature
and we'll talk about the deltas between
them and show individual temperatures
for individual components in the full
secondary video along with our power
testing but either way quite hot 95c
package temperature core temps were
pretty hot as well and that is going to
be somewhat of a limiter in the future
for overclocking that beyond at least
four point five four point six at one
point to zone 5 in our testing the next
thing is for power we saw power draw can
increase to a couple hundred watts when
you're really overclocking it hard and
driving more voltage through it and
that's especially true if you start off
seeing memory as well so this is a CPU
that is definitely a bit more
power-hungry than some of the others
we've worked with recently the power
efficiency is not something we've
plotted yet in terms of like performance
per watt
but looking just that power drive
overall it is definitely up there
couple hundred watts when overclocked
and again separate video for that but
that gives you a primarily Zeo some
basic information from us while waiting
for the full remainder of that power and
thermal coverage now as far as the rest
of the stuff so there's some information
on efi and bios we used the latest EF is
from asus for the prime deluxe
motherboard and that was provided to us
in advance so we were fortunate enough
to get that latest efi the the most
recent revision probably before launch
day or the embargo that day so that
means our our tests were done on all the
latest stuff which is good we email the
acs asked for it early and they
basically told us to wait till we got it
which we did so that was good and and i
appreciate that they told us to hold on
for it because it was an important
update for overclocking but for reviews
that may not have had the latest efi
updates
story similar to what we saw with Rison
where this is clearly a somewhat rush to
launch and you could probably blame the
maker of the cpu for that more than the
board partners just like with the rise
much it was very rushed with rising the
board partners really only had a few
weeks to dial in on the finalized
microcode and with X 299 it's not too
much different so there will be some
improvements to some things particularly
overclocking with EFI updates going
forward in general the baseline
improvement from an EFI update and by
baseline I mean no overclocking just out
of box performance is not going to be
that different in most cases but there
are some interesting things with mesh
and cached data in the BIOS set from
what we've seen so far could implicate
that there's a performance off of just
from updating efi and leaving everything
else alone but that's something we'll
have to look at if it is something that
applies to us so far was the asian
support it seems like we're good i
haven't tested this one yet that's next
on the list though so we'll see how that
does out of box in its current state and
then update you Phi to get a full
picture of if EFI updates do anything
out a box or not may or may not get
published depends on how interesting it
is moving on the next topic is a thread
Ripper so I've got a note here to
mention the thread Ripper release date
again this isn't something we talked
about in our convey text coverage we
received a word from one of the board
partners when we look at their board on
when they were planning to ship that
board and that means that's probably the
day thread Ripper comes out so I'm
bringing this up again because a lot of
people in the comments yesterday in our
video I made a passing comment about
thread rippers release I said August
10th and some people were like wait what
I didn't know that so just just kind of
put it out there again August 10th is
what we've been told that's not from AMD
that's from other people in the industry
so that's what it looks like for thread
rippers launch date and then a Alienware
has their new area 51 thread repetition
computer and the area 51 thread Ripper
is supposed to be shipping on actually
TBD but July 27th is the pre-order date
so that coincides with August 10th for
a potential release say that's not
necessary final we don't have word from
AMD that's what it looks like the area
51 thread river system will be 16 cores
32 threads just like the CPU is 64
gigabytes of memory
29:33 ddr4 is included with probably
options to customize and then to 1080s
and that's a lie or 3/5 80s and
crossfire with a couple terabytes of
storage as well and then nvidia has
their new battle box GTX battle box
which has an option included the ship
with Raisa North Red River processors
alongside I 9 extreme series processors
so that's what's coming out in the
pre-built the Xbox one so this is
Microsoft's project Scorpio it finally
did get a name a launch date and a price
and those are Xbox 1x for the name the
launch date November 7th and the prize
$500 pre-orders should be open soon but
aren't officially open as of this
filming the Xbox one X is sticking with
a custom apu from AMD it's an 8 core and
it's still Jaguars so not a an
architectural shift from the previous
Xbox and this aligns with the sort of
confusing console cycle we're in right
now where they're doing 0.5 versions of
their consoles not just a hard new
console like we normally see the CPU
cores are going to be clocked at 2.3
gigahertz and the GPU cores will run at
1172 megahertz from what is officially
known and then it's supposed to have 40
CPUs and 2560 streaming processors so
that's mostly course back to the Xbox
one X surprisingly Microsoft showed off
a whole lot of information about this
including enough information to start
piecing together vrm details which are
on the web if you're interested in it
but we might look at that later in the
separate piece just kind of depends on
what's out there the rating for in terms
of just compute performance for all
compute looks like 6 teraflops doesn't
necessarily translate to a whole lot
that you can compare to in the PC world
directly but gives you a good idea of
where it should fall in terms of
performance memory system 12 gigabytes
of gddr5 9x and that is on a 384-bit bus
with a speed of 6 point 8 gigabytes per
seconds or getting close to around the
max of gddr5 not quite there yet
and then it's also got a paper chamber
for the cooler but that's what we have
for now for the basics there will be
some level of custom tuning on the vrm
from what we've heard but don't have a
whole lot of electrical engineering
actual details on that just we know that
it will be custom tune curved erm this
next system is a really quick
announcement just the Acer predator 21 X
for those who remember it was that
massive system that laptop basically a
desktop a laptop that was shown at CES
and it's got the curved 21 inch IPS
display that one priced at $9,000 they
have announced that they will be making
300 of those so that's what we know
about it it's clearly a Halo product and
available now for order if you have nine
grand
lying around for a just a weird
anomalous laptop that is really meant to
show people and say look how wealthy I
am but you could also buy something like
a car with that so that's what they've
got acer is kind of predator 21x finally
coming out and then next we have
industry news Samson is ramping up
production of its 64 layer NAND that's
been anticipated for a while and it
plans to introduce products using 64
later technology towards the second half
of the year that's 2017 the new 64
layered I will use a capacity of 256
gigabytes take up less space on the
wafer and if capable of one gigabit per
second per die with allegedly 30% energy
efficiency improvements from the lower
input voltage of 2.5 volts that's new
from Samsung new from Global Foundries
also in the silicon area there's a seven
nanometer FinFET on target for 2018 and
this new FinFET process is scheduled for
volume production next year the process
is ostensibly capable of a 40%
generational performance boost that is
to say 40% more processing power and
twice the area scaling when compared to
the current 14 nanometer FinFET it will
be some time before seven nanometers
relevant to consumers but Global
Foundries
intends to stick to their product
roadmap an SSD newsplex store has the
new s3 series of SSDs they are the s3 G
and the s3 C coming in SATA and MDOT two
form factors with a new 14 nanometer
lantern and courtesy of SK Hynix the s3g
is an m2 device SBC is 2.5 and
performances in the mid 500 megabyte
range sequential read and write rating
and it comes with a 3-year warranty and
will have a 35 or 70 total terabytes
written endurance rating depending on
the capacity of the drive and we
normally recommend that not supriya
order things actually always recommend
not to be order things but this next one
is special and you should get your
pre-order button clicking ready because
it's going to sell out soon it is the
a.k racing gaming desk set 350 dollar
one of these it's the table for 350
bucks pre-orders will order actually
just purchasing I guess will be open on
July 15th if you care trying to look
through it and find why it costs $350
the only things I came up with were
metal construction metal MDF and a
carbon fiber roll finish kind of like a
pseudo carbon fiber finish on top for
the unit so 350 bucks with that it will
be offered in red blue green and white
and it is a certified gaming desk I
guess but that was shown at e3 so now
you can get a gaming desk to complement
your gaming chair and gaming everything
else because gaming sells the word
gaming entitled sells that's actually
true from other boards Nvidia card spoke
to the vendors about it that's that's
the industry we're in and then quickly
we've got two new displays that we
spotted this week Dell has outed a
gaming monitor under the Alienware sub
brand and that is the aw to five one
eight H it's a twenty four point five
inch TN panel with a 1080p resolution on
the screen is 240 Hertz refresh with a
one millisecond great great response
time for and it's brightness and 1001
contrast ratio that was new monitor will
come in both g-sync and free sync
variants for seven hundred and five
hundred dollars respectively there's
also a new LG 34 UC 89 G which is a
gaming panel the screen is a curved
ultra wide display with an aspect ratio
of 21 by 9 and so ultra wide it's an IPS
panel 144 Hertz refresh
1080p height for resolution and five
modes I can respond to him at $1,000 so
that rounds up the news from the past
week we have plenty to do more on X 299
including the 77 40 X review subscribe
if you want to see that our complete
thermal and power analysis which is
taking a bit of time because it's
running pretty warm and we're trying to
really dig into things and figure out
more about why other than just saying
thermal paste and kind of today and then
we've got plenty of information well a
couple of special feature benchmarks as
well featuring those CPUs that are
largely validating marketing claims so
stay tuned for all of that you go to
patreon.com/scishow and access tiles out
directly or you go to store that gamers
access not net to grab a shirt like this
one we are restocking this week thank
you again for watching subscribe for
more I'll see you all next time
and I'm here to talk about Need for
Speed payback</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
