coolers are made following the same
process as most air cooler manufacturing
so today it's time to show the steps of
liquid cooler manufacturing we visited
both Coolermaster and deep cool in hue
Jo and Shenzhen China to document the
start-to-finish manufacturing steps for
closed-loop liquid coolers including
intensive oven burn ins cold plate
skiving liquid filling and more before

more at the link in the description
below for this tour we're looking at two
factories to get the full picture on how
CL C or a i/o manufacturing progresses
Coolermaster and deep cool both showed
us different parts of the process and
each has slightly different approaches
to manufacturing depending on how the
coolers are made at each company deep
cool for example has a much more manual
process for its pump block assembly
whereas cooler master uses a completely
different pump block design so that part
of assembly is totally different we'll
start with the cold plates cold plates
are arguably the most important part of
liquid cooling considering the fin pitch
and density is what really drives
performance it's also what directly
contacts the products being cooled micro
fins have to be designed to avoid flow
impedance but they also need to provide
enough surface area to sink heat quickly
into the liquid glue in solution to make
cold plates both companies work with
skiving machines skiving is the process
of slicing thin pieces of material with
precision deep cool only just got its
new CNCs and skiving machines in and
although the machines were set up and
even had an initial feet of copper they
were not yet operating deep Cola hopes
to begin making its own cold plates by
mid-year
20:19 to reduce reliance on third-party
suppliers Coolermaster is already making
its own cold plates and also makes cold
plates for other partners in the
industry
the skiving machine is precise and
relatively slow only capable of making
30 cold plates with micro fins per hour
coolermaster is able to add up to 2 to 3
sets of skiving tools per cnc depending
on how large the product is meaning that
maximum production per machine is 60 to
90 cold plates per hour
considering the production speed of
other cooling products like heat pipes
at 50,000 units per day the making of
cold plates is expensive and slow by
comparison multiple high end costly
skiving machines are needed to keep up
with demand the process uses a wedge
that cuts thin slices of copper and then
stands them up as it moves back and
prepares for the next cut this moves
through the cold plate fin by fin takes
a long time to do looking at one of
these cold plates under a microscope
it's clear just how dense and accurate
the end result is and this is something
that you can see on basically every
liquid cooling product today whether
it's made by cooler master or someone
else this is one of the slowest and most
expensive parts of the process aside
from the multi our burn ins that happen
at end of assembly deep cool has a
workshop filled with its own CNCs and
just got CNC skiving machines but
presently focuses its workshop on making
other products like drilling holes for
industrial heat sinks that customers buy
radiators are typically made by a third
party supplier and sold to the CLC
companies even ASA tech one of the
largest CLC makers and the most
prevalent in the US market for closed
loop or AIO products buys most of its
radiators from third-party suppliers
coolermaster does some custom work on
radiators we have shots of one of their
CNC machines cutting out custom hole
spacing and brackets for a large
radiator product in a non computer
application that we can't talk about but
Coolermaster does some custom work on
them and deep cool is also capable doing
custom work on radiators a lot of the
supply does come from a third party
though once the radiator is purchased or
made and the rubber tubes are purchased
all the materials come to an assembly
line for installation this might ruin
the mad
for some of you but like most products
these companies don't make literally
every single part that goes into the
final product they might design them but
if the supply chain is more mature
elsewhere like rubber glass and
cardboard where they supply the entire
world and other industries not just
computer hardware that it's often better
to buy those materials it's cheaper and
more cost-effective that way and the
quality might even be better because
it's a developed Factory for an industry
that might be larger than the PC
hardware industry at deep coolest
Factory the first step of assembly
starts with making the tubes or at least
combining them this step involves at
socketing the fitting into the tube the
fitting is placed in a machine with a
socket to secure the piece while the
tube is clamped down to hold it still an
operator activates the press so that the
fitting is automatically inserted into
the tube at which point the tube is
passed down the line for use in a
vertical standing press the next press
pushes down on the assembled tube to
securely fit the pieces together this is
done by activating another foot pedal
which brings down the force of the
vertical standing press after this the
completed hose is loaded into a tool
that deep cool custom made using a
radiator bracket to secure the radiator
for another press fit the operator
installs Barb's on to the radiator seats
the tube into another clamp and then
uses a lever to move the radiator toward
the tube firmly securing the two
together this process is shockingly
manual the assembly line requires human
oversight or action at almost every
single step for this product and for the
captain Pro products as an example and
just like the previous steps this
completed radiator assembly is then
brought to another press this time
asserting force onto the barbs and tubes
to bind the two together and prevent
leaks or weak points the next part of
assembly is specific to deep cools
design as it uses a multi chamber
approach on the CPU block first screws
are dispensed out of a machine for the
operator to grab with the electric
screwdriver the operator then secures
the bottom chamber to the internal
components with the screws provided the
next step is to fit the PCB and light
diffuser together along with the RGB
LEDs on the PCB so the externally routed
tube
tubas screwed into the middle of the
chambers baseplate then set aside for
future steps while this is happening a
separate operator simultaneously uses a
bench mounted air compressor to blow any
dust off of the impellers and the lower
chambers the impeller is then fitted
into the lower chamber and the assembly
is set aside the next worker applies
glue and sealant to hold the PCB in
place then routes the cables and starts
the Assembly of the top two-thirds of
the pump block the pump next gets
connected directly to a bench top power
supply which is used to check that the
pump is operating within voltage spec
and pump speeds back there are a few
things here that I mean you really
shouldn't be looking at the number to
get an idea of rpm one of them is that
it doesn't have any impedance right now
there's no liquid in the loop so it's
not running out the spec you'll see in
the final product the other one is that
manufacturers have an RPM response
tolerance of about plus or minus 10% on
pumps and fans and note also that the
output is in the tens of thousands here
because of the pole count on the motor
so one there's no liquid impedance and
two the operator needs to take into
account whether it's a four pole eighth
Pole or similar design then divided by
the appropriate value to get the true
rpm ultimately they're just looking for
a number within an acceptable range to
show that the pump works after this the
next step is to mount the external hose
into the bottom chamber of the pump the
final step is to mount the gasket and
the cold plate to the pomp along with
any jet flow plates and use a robotic
arm to hold the cold plate firmly in
place while all the screws get installed
screws are dispensed again from a hopper
and grabbed by the magnetic bit and the
chamber is held upside down by a custom
mount the screws are installed in a
specific pattern to ensure force is
distributed evenly during assembly and
then the cooler is moved down the line
workers after this will use a tool to
ensure that this tubing is securely
mounted in the lower chamber and ensure
that there are no leaks this is done
with another in-house made tool and is
one part quality check one part assembly
the next workers seat the pump block
into another custom tool then install
external clamps around the tubes this is
another leak prevention measure and
helps firmly secure the housing together
finalizing the Assembly of the pump
housing and block as
each cooler exits the assembly line it's
placed on a large rack of coolers and
wheeled to the other side of the factory
floor where leak checks and coolant
filling will happen the next test uses a
machine to determine if the reservoir
and pump unit are airtight the air leak
tester pumps a known pressure into the
cooler and holds it for a period of time
if the machine doesn't measure the same
amount of pressure in return the unit is
not airtight and a red diode will light
up this tells the technician that the
unit needs to go back to quality control
and be resubmitted prior to filling it
with liquid deep cool demonstrated how
this works by intentionally giving us an
incomplete cooler that hadn't been fully
assembled yet for testing the cooler was
pulled off the line prior to the
fittings being secured and run through
the leak tester which found that the
cooler was not a closed loop and then
rejected it
so this happens before liquid is filled
and prevents any accidents but also
helps with RMA and not having them next
the coolers are logged with serial
numbers and the pre fill weight is
logged for RMA purposes this helps track
permeation or loss of liquid over time
in the event of a customer return and
can be tracked down to when the cooler
was made and where it was made the
coolers are all logged and weighed and
if any cooler deviates from the average
weight by more than an accepted
tolerance the cooler is sent back for
quality control and to ensure that all
parts are present the cooler next moves
to the infusion machine which vacuum
seals the cooler for a couple of seconds
to make sure it's airtight and then uses
simple pressure to suck liquid into the
cooler and the radiator from an external
tank that's filled with the liquid
rather than filling the cooler
forcefully pressure is used to pull the
liquid in it's pretty simple physics but
it works surprisingly well for this type
of application the coolant if you didn't
already known is typically a propylene
glycol and the common industry use is
about 20 percent propylene glycol to
distilled water in these types of
products although that spec can change
depending on what the product is being
made for some go as high as 40% it just
depends on what their cold tolerance is
their heat tolerance is and sticking
closer to a lower percentage propylene
glycol will improve the cooling efficacy
is just a trade off of what other
performance or endurance
elements you want in the cooler and
we've talked about that and some of our
reviews Coolermaster does all this in a
similar way for the liquid filling part
cooler masters factory has an assembly
line that feeds liquid coolers to a
technician who operates the coolant
machines the technician secures the
cooler and a custom-made brace then
pushes a button to tell the machine to
lower down and fill the radiator with
coolant cooler master allowed us to try
this alongside brian of BPS customs who
failed miserably and made us look like
we knew what we were doing if you want
to see some of brian's content from his
trip in his full case factory tour check
his channel link in the description
below we did encourage watching it
anyway once they let us try we mounted
the cooler press the button and waited
as it filled the loop this process takes
some time as it checks pressure multiple
times to ensure the right volume has
been filled and it does quality checks
along the way
but once it's done it's done and
everything has been quality checked and
is known to be good and not leaking
after this step we were given an
electric screwdriver to install the fill
port cap the cooler was boxed for us and
we'll actually be getting it in our
offices for testing back to deep cools
factory line for the rest the cooler is
next weighed again for quality control
to ensure that the weight after filling
is within an acceptable range of the
average with the cooler now function
complete it's hooked up to another bench
top power supply and turned off this
time the pump speed can be checked as it
performs in reality given that there's
finally liquid in the loop and
performances check to ensure that it
matches the spec the expected range for
the captain Pro is about 2200 rpm plus
or minus 10% which is industry standard
for variants across multiple suppliers
of CLC's there are fan headers also
built into the table to power and test
the pump and any failures can be
salvaged after QC analysis although
failures at this stage are uncommon the
pump is also quality checked for wine
where a technician places the cold plate
in the pump against their ear to
subjectively listen for any high-pitched
noises any actual DB testing is done in
a separate chamber but subjective
testing is important to determine that
no unsellable noises occur these might
happen if dust or debris end up in the
loop prior to completion for example and
so human analysis
is done on every single cooler off the
line to ensure that no such noise has
happened this is similar at some other
lines where deep cool for example builds
their fans and we have another video on
that where similar subjective and
objective noise tests happen for the
entire process thus far about 85 of the
more advanced coolers to be made per
hour at deep cools factory the factory
produces so many of these coolers that
it has production times and nailed down
to the second and told us that it takes
about 21 66 seconds or about 36.1
minutes to assemble an entire captain
Pro 240 cooler and in terms of assembly
time 85 per hour on this one line and
there are multiple lines of course is a
pretty high time cost so this explains
why you see some of these liquid cooling
products costing more even than their
competitive air cooling products when
it's something as simple as a 120
millimeter radiator for example because
the time cost is still large even if the
performance is comparable to a lower end
product so that has to be made up
somewhere the coolers are next deposited
onto another transport rack this time
with pump headers and PCBs built into
the torture rack the torture rack is
rolled into a literal oven where thermal
burnin testing tortures each cooler for
two hours to ensure that it survives a
worst-case environment Coolermaster does
similar testing and most of the liquid
quality manufacturers ASA tech also does
similar testing for deep cools part this
chamber tests every single cooler off
the Y Andrew our stoic cameraman was
brave enough to venture inside of the
oven baking the coolers each cooler is
run out of maximum pump speed for two
hours in the room with its thermometer
hanging from the ceiling indicates a
constant room temperature of at least 60
degrees Celsius deep cool runs the
burnin with that room temperature set
although opening the door to let us in
did reduce that temperature so it's a
bit lower when we walked in there but
still very hot the oven test is used to
thermally torture all aspects of the
cooler whereas the upcoming t resist
test is used for specifically validating
performance on a cpu stand and device
and that's the last test it's a thermal
resistance test where a hot plate is
used to burn the cooler in one more time
this time the test is more targeted on
and Coldplay performance the cooler is
mounted to a hot plate roughly the size
of a CPU which is then configured to run
at 150 watts for the captain Pro 240
it's reconfigured for other coolers as
necessary depending on their target TDP
or what amount of heat they're meant to
tolerate it also uses a thermocouple
internally to measure temperature of the
hot plate and the cold plate this is
done for a period of about 60 seconds
and checks against a known good
measurement of a golden sample cooler if
the resistance goes above the known-good
bar and software the cooler fails and is
sent back to quality control we asked if
there's any plus or minus tolerance over
this bar and we're told that this part
of QC being at the end of the line has
no tolerance for failure any coolers
that exceed the known good bar are
instantly rejected for quality check and
fixing the radiators are also hooked up
to fans for this testing so this is a
full cooler stress test at this point in
the process pretty much every cooler
will pass and move on to being boxed and
sold via retail there are also some
additional steps on deep pools new
radiators the ones that are advertised
as leak proof where they use basically
just a balloon inside of the radiator to
burp any air depending on the
temperature of the liquid and we'll talk
about this more in the future as we get
into testing those products but the
additional steps will involve inserting
the balloon and then closing off that
new chamber of the radiator and we may
talk about that more in our upcoming
reviews like Coolermaster deep cool also
makes a lot of products for partners
including some other brands that you
know in the cooler industry and we can't
name and they can use some of their
machinery and lines to make equipment
for power supplies for telecom companies
for heatsink fans that are used in up
lighting and studio lights and aluminum
or copper heat sinks for medical
products so these cooling companies they
do a lot more than just the PC parts
that we know and this is something we'll
talk about more in the future as well so
