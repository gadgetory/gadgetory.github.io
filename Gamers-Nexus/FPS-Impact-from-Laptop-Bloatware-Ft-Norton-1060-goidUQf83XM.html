laptops for review we noticed that they
were anything but instant at least these
MSI units we got and that's because when
we open the system tray we're fronted
with this monstrosity on the screen now
even with an SSD opening Windows
Explorer took one full second minimally
and Norton is there about three
different control panels are there
because you need different interfaces to
get to the same place and all manner of
other bloatware today we're showing you
just how profoundly a systems FPS is
dragged down by bloatware extra software
you don't want but before we get into
that this coverage is brought to you by
iBUYPOWER and a new element gaming PC
with a full tempered glass side window
LED lights and the fans and under glow
and is basically a modified s340 these
are two systems we're using to
demonstrate the problem one is an msi
ge62 VR Apache Pro this is a brand new
system from the factory and clearly
demonstrates that the sluggish input is
not a hardware issue the ge62 VR has a
gtx 1060 fold desktop GPU installed an
i7 6700 HQ cpu that boosts to 3.5
gigahertz 256 gigabyte m2 SSD 16
gigabytes of ddr4 and cost $1,700 so
clearly it should not be a hardware
problem it should not be slow out of the
box the other system is from last
generation and uses a 970m mobile GPU
with an i7 CPU and is also an MSI GECs
laptop the software pre-installed and
launching on boot includes Norton
AntiVirus killer networking steelseries
keyboard management touch pad management
warranty registration popups that are
incessant MSI control panel Intel
software another MSI software solution
Microsoft onedrive and a couple of other
things Norton is the biggest offender in
terms of active processor utilization
just during file transfers alone moving
games for example from our internal
server to the laptop we saw CPU
utilization spiked to 100% at times CPU
usage often hit 30% sporadically during
use just normal use often when Norton
decided to scan something and this is an
important topic although a lot of
viewers of this channel are enthusiasts
of some kind you likely have a good idea
how to optimize one of these things out
of the box ie uninstall everything not
everyone who's buying these laptops will
know that and they might see it as the
brand is bad the hardware is bad Windows
is bad something like that when in
reality it's just filled with trash from
the get-go let's look at the impact of
this messy OS on gaming performance full
test methodology and the article can be
found in the link in the description
below make sure you click that three
more on this issue the hypothesis here
is that more CPU bound games will
exhibit a bigger performance swing as
the bloatware is taxing the CPU
sporadically during up time starting us
off the ge62 VR with a gtx 1060 pushes
these numbers for GTA 5 at 1080p with
our very high and ultra settings
configured without bloat where we're
running 109 FPS average 78 1% lows and
70 0.1% lows the article by the way
explains these numbers if you don't know
what they mean but the short of it is
that they are the slowest groupings of
frames rather than minimum measured by
looking at frame times with bloatware
those numbers fall 290 FPS average or in
the 50s for 0.1% low FPS just for the
average alone that's a change of 20.7%
by disabling all the pre-installed
software that comes with the laptop and
uninstalling norton for a higher
resolution play that's a game-changer
because it could be the difference
between 60 FPS Plus or not and the lows
are hugely important too because we will
start seeing visible stuttering with
other games and let's just take a look
at one of those now here's Metro last
light a CPU intensive game at 1080p with
very high quality and high tessellation
the GTX 1060 rig runs at 75 points 7 FPS
average without bloatware 54.7 FBS 1%
low and 51 FPS 0.1% low is good numbers
across the board with a system running
its factory default including the
software we're seeing a 59 FPS average
and less than half the 0.1% low values
this is a huge hit to performance and
will present itself as staggered FPS
output in gameplay there's a major
disparity to in frame time pacing and
more suitably this also means that the
low metrics would be totally
incompatible
with fluid vr play without dynamic
quality adjustments in the face of MSI's
VR badge on the system
looking at the 970m unit last generation
we're seen an output of 40.7 FPS average
with 30 FPS 1% lows and 24 0.1% lows
with no bloatware at all looking at its
performance from the factory again with
all of the software those numbers are
almost halved across the board there's
nearly a 2x gain and performance just by
removing clutter and that's particularly
noticeable with the lows 13.7 FPS 0.1%
metrics means visible stutter and
choppin framerate output which creates a
jarring experience
here's shadow of mordor on the 970m unit
at 1080p with ultra graphics we're
seeing a marginal improvement from 44
FPS 240 9.3 FPS average or approximately
12% and that is again caused by the
software pre-installed overwatch is the
only game we tested where no serious
improvement was shown and that's a
result of the game being minimally
demanding for this type of hardware and
it's also bumping into GPU limits before
CPU limits the ge62 VR 1060 unit is
producing a frame rate of 1 47.7 FPS
average with both the clean and bloated
systems but we see a market improvement
in the 0.1% and 1% low metrics with the
cleaned out unit the same is true for
the 970m where performance is most
different at the low values this
coincides with our findings that the CPU
chokes almost randomly on norton and
other background processes the takeaway
here is not that these systems are bad
the hardware is actually pretty good
when we look especially the 1060 s
performance with no software installed
or active and it's really just
unfortunate for MSI because out of box
the unit to a consumer will look worse
than it's actually capable of performing
if you uninstall or disable a lot of the
stuff that's unnecessary it doesn't have
to be all of it you can leave this
steelseries keyboard stuff like that but
Norton in particular get rid of that the
MSI control panel is certainly not
needed you get rid of that this system
will perform anywhere from 12% at the
low end to 20 plus % better in framerate
with the exception being games like
overwatch which are more bound by GPU
and stuff like that instead and even in
those instances you see improvement in
the low metrics which will
do stutter because the CPU is just
randomly spiking to 30% plus load for
the bloatware applications not for the
actual game itself so if MSI would kind
of move away from this it will improve
two things one is the user experience
out of box which of course we think is
the most important and two from maybe
MSI's business perspective it will
improve the benchmark numbers when
reviewers look at these units and from a
competitive standpoint that's something
they should care about even though it's
maybe not something that consumers care
about a lot it is a driving argument for
making a business decision to
potentially acts some of the software
that's pre-installed one thing we talk
about with system integrators like cyber
power origin and iBUYPOWER is that they
all have options to ship the unit with
no bloatware at all this is the correct
approach and should be adopted by MSI
and besides MSI units are often sold as
rebranded SI units anyway if you were to
buy one of these from MSI and then the
same unit again from an SI who opt out
of bloatware you actually see better
performance out of box with the SI unit
and MSI is not the only offender either
gigabyte ships their laptops the new
tens laptops with xsplit pre-installed
and their own control panel software
which they call smart dashboard and then
there's the ACE use laptops which
include a sonic sound suite that's for
sound control also unnecessary and
xsplit and ROG Control Center or
whatever they call these days ROG
gaming's and I believe is what they call
it now another useless control panel
that controls all the same things you
can do through windows or better
applications that are less load
intensive on the CPU for no reason
whatsoever so these are not issues that
are strictly relegated to these MSI
units and I guess the takeaway here is
when you buy a laptop this isn't
obviously something you can just DIY
like a desktop when you go buy a laptop
go through the software that's on it and
get rid of it if you can do without that
software obviously some things you would
want to keep like the touchpad
management pretty important those things
that you can't really do just from
windows sometimes anyway you can keep
the SteelSeries stuff for the RGB
keyboard but Norton if you get rid of it
I I'm sorry Norton I
like your product if you get rid of it
do so the control panels like the ROG
one the MSI one the gigabyte they all
have a control panel get rid of that and
of course there's other things like
onedrive if you're not going to use it
just dump it if you're going to use it
whatever no big deal so that's kind of
the takeaway the only thing here we
haven't really discussed is that some of
this may not be quite as easy to resolve
for the manufacturers as just removing
whatever the software is because they
likely have partnerships in place
there's a good chance that there's some
kind of financial partnership between
Norton and MSI one of them if not
getting money they're definitely doing
some kind of exposure trade so
partnerships are things were obviously
not including here that could impact
what shows up this year versus maybe
next year if they make changes based on
testing but that's kind of the only one
outlier that we can't really look at too
closely so that is it for this video
