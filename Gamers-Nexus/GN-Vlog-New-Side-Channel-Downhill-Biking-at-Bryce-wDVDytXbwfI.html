$2.99 and KB latex and skylake X just
launched those that came out immediately
when we got back from Taiwan Taipei for
copy text so we were in Taipei for two
weeks covering comp attacks and other
various things in the area I had some
unfinished business here at Bryce bike
park where just before we left for
Taipei I had for the first time ever
actually placed someone reasonably in
time trials on one of the courses here
so I was in third I really wanted first
there was two two seconds off of the
fastest run for this year so far not the
fastest overall but close enough for me
so I'm back here I'm also going to be
doing a trail called brew bomb and
mixture of brewed through and car bomb
and a trail called pickleback which has
a bunch of really cool wooden features
like a corkscrew
lots of drops lots of there's a step up
that's really cool dirt step up there's
a big table at the bottom and a small
booter and a wall ride so we're going to
go through all that today just there's
just a blog basically the plan here is
to do a decompression blog following sky
like ax and KB like ax which was
basically a week of non-stop work
because we had to get those up right
after the trip to Computex so enjoy it's
a bit different from what we normally do
but gives you a bit of an insight to the
other side of some of the stuff that I
work on ready
yeah trying to have it your are you
thing rocks now now I'm good
everyone it's day 2 of 2 I'm in the
hotel about to head out to go Visine
I've got about seven hours of riding
ahead of me and then five hours of
driving at the end of the day I wanted
to walk you through the bike setup in
the gear setup so this is a Canfield
balance it's a 2014 frame
I built the bike myself about two years
ago I want to say and it rides just
about everything so I take this to local
trail to end the downhill trails I have
a fox float 36 mill with 160 travel so
if you don't know bikes basically the 36
is the stanchion diameter so 36
millimeters instead of 34 and then
travels 160 that's right there's that
whole orange bar compress it into the
lowers these are called the lowers so
you get to mind a bit of advice today so
stanchions compress into the lowers that
helps absorb a lot of the impact from
jumps and drops this red knob is the
rebound adjustment so I don't know the
exact setting I have it on it's a little
bit past halfway for a faster rebound so
I set this up to rebound a bit faster
because once you can control the bike a
faster rebound means it's getting the
stanchions out of the lower just quicker
for the wheels and tires I'm still
running 26 inch these are I think 2.35
wide the others are 2.4 and I've got
Maxis minions for each you can actually
see see these black dots here that's
because these are tube lists so that's
the no tubes fluid inside fill in any
potential holes in the tire the disc
brake on the other side that's a 200
millimeter rotor with the Shimano st.
brakes that I just put on this year
those are four piston I think they're
quad 'pizza maybe try piston but they're
they're either three or four piston
brakes and you're interested in the pc
market you'll recognize this this is a
heatsink
so there's actually aluminum fins and
the idea of it I actually want to test
it one day
but the idea is that as you ride the air
going through there should cool off the
brake pads because as they heat up you
get brake fade which basically means
that your brakes don't work as well for
the shot this is a non stock one this is
an aftermarket Fox float X I put this on
because I exploded my shock that came
with it which was a king creek DVR CS
that I just had rebuilt but the Fox
belowdecks is a 2 this one is a 200 bill
travel float and that's about 8 inches
or so of travel the front as a 160 is
what is that six six seven inches of
travel so this one's set up right now to
be a little bit softer because they
can't feel balanced this frame is really
uh it does not progress too well through
the travel in my experience so petals I
have the race based Atlas pedals I
bought a couple years ago these have
lasted me a really long time you can see
the scuff marks on from where they've
bashed into things but these have
travelled the world with me to different
conventions where I try to go bike after
and they're still in great shape so
those are nice I have a Z derailleur if
you are not familiar with these this is
the part that handles the shifting so
this cage is a small short cage
derailleur this cage moves when you pull
that shift cable which actually is
really afraid I just notice I need to
plenty to get that replaced today you
shift this will pull or push enter out
on the cassette this is called the
cassette and then the chain moves
according to the movement of the
derailleur I have no front derailleur
I'm running a 1 by 10 and so the there's
just one chain ring on the front and
it's a narrow wide which means that the
teeth go wide narrow narrow narrow wide
and that helps keep the chain from
falling off because it's got no front
derailleur on it for the rear brake I
have a 180 ml disc and also the Shimano
sense with also the heat sinking
stuff on there I don't really know how
well weird you kind of want to take like
I don't know an IR camera to it or
something calibrate it and test but
that's what I'm running for the bike for
the cockpit I have a diety saddle this
is a Pender saddle so the nose comes out
of it you really don't sit on the bike
when you're doing downhill you're pretty
much hovered all the time over the back
wheel like right here is where you're
kind of hovering in the air and the idea
is you keep the seat low see it's pretty
low here so that there's a lot of room
for air time for jumps drops things so
that the saddle goes between your legs
rather than up against your butt because
if it goes up it'll push you and push
you forward and off the bike and you'll
end oh so that was the bike here's the
gear I some of the stuff you don't want
you need like these elbow and forearm
guards won't do a whole lot for you I
mean if you're going to crash and break
something you're going to break
something and these all they do is stop
the scratches so I wear them anyway
right now but they probably are the
least effective out of all the stuff I
wear the helmet and the knee pads are
among the most effective knee pads
unlike these your knees are only going
to be damaged from just like a hard
impact not from a twist
so these soften that blow a lot you can
land and slide on your knees with these
and won't be hurt the helmet obviously
for a lot of reasons is something you
really want so I bought this one due a
year ago for last season okay so that's
it for the walkthrough let's go ride one
more day
that's it for the vlog being a full week
of testing coming up as always system
and background running tests already for
the week you're wondering why the camera
is scattering light the way it is it's
because the lens covered cracks after
that one crash which wasn't a big deal
by the way I had cleared the ramps
people the drop before it for the first
time and came into it a little too hot
but yeah so that's easily replaceable
twenty bucks but I apologize for the
image that's all for this one
stay tuned for computer related content
not bike related content or you can go
to GNC the channel I'll link it below
where I will upload at least one or two
full course runs from last trip and then
going forward most of the biking things
will be on that channel so subscribe to
GNC for that they were watching and I'll
see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
