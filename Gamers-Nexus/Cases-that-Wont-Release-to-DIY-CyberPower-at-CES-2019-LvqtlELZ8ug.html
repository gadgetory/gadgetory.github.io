at CES 2019 and if you don't normally
watch outside videos this one might
still interest you because with the SI
some of the case manufacturers will make
custom modified versions of their cases
that you all know like the P 400 from
fantex for example and build the version
that you can't buy separately often it's
sad because some of the custom versions
are pretty damn good so we're gonna be
looking at one of those today it's a
modified vant XP 400 that CyberPower did
it's an exclusive CyberPower product and
has some cool changes to the people 100
that we would have liked to see in the
original before that this video is
brought to you by the gigabyte z 390 ARS
master motherboard which comes equipped
with one of the more powerful z3 90 V
RMS for heavier overclocks on the new
9th gen intel cpus the ARS master is
also one of the few motherboards with a
real heatsink this generation featuring
a mix of high surface area fins and
looks oriented hover blocks oh and it's
also got updated RDV illumination learn
more at the link below there's also we
have the Ragnarok here and I wanted to
point this out first because presently
it's not on its complete form but it
will feature the Intel 28 core CPU has
already disclosed a couple months ago at
this point the 31 75 X so the idea of
this ultimately be 28 core CPU you can
do something like a dual Titan RT X is
its customizable on their website but
the top of the top skew is something
like at 1520 thousand dollar PC dual
Titan RT axes with water cooling 28 core
CPU and the reason a 28 core CPU from
Intel requires a special case is because
if you saw the ACS board that we looked
at in our recent video it has 92 total
power pins on it so there are four eight
pins two six pins and 224 pins I think
that adds up to 92 off the top of my
head but it's got almost a hundred power
pins so you kind of need two power
supplies the case here the ragnerok
system with cyber powers custom-built
case it fits
dual power supply you could either use
one for it's got a separate power button
so you can use one for a mini ITX system
if you wanted to configure it that way
on their site or just use both to drive
the Asus Dominus motherboard which will
be I think
the primary motherboard featured for the
the 28 core CPU so custom cases required
may be the I would say the Leon leo 11
dynamic finally has a use for two power
supplies but I think the case is
probably too small for that motherboard
so just kind of interesting from a this
is something I won't likely buy
standpoint of extremely high-end
computer but that's what it's looking
right for the the 28 core presence in
sis right now the case itself is unique
it's the front panel despite having a
panel here that's that looks sort of
closed off it has a massive gap in the
middle so there's plenty of airflow
there and also it's kind of like that
you've seen this design with the Cougar
conquer in the past where there's a sort
of open design for the side panels
plenty of air can get through here
plenty of air can get through this side
I mean you can fit your whole hand in
there so airflow not an issue for this
case and the rest of it just comes down
to form factor being massive for
something like a dual system setup or 28
core setup with the 14 inch by 14 inch
motherboards that asus is making right
now which is giant so I think 280x is
typically about 12 by 11 or 10 or
something like that so yeah that's
that's the ragnarok pretty cool they
have a set up right now it's there were
some parts still in transit so ends up
with a semi custom loop on it and then
220 ATT is with the model ultimately
will be a bit higher end when it's ready
on the site and then the fan tax case
this one is it's a CyberPower customized
version of the P 400 so the main changes
are the body of the chassis from the
side you'll recognize the P 350 X and
then from the front it looks like the P
400 except they've cut out a grill on
the left and right side of the sort of
the chamfered edge on the front panel of
the chassis and that was our biggest
problem with the P 400 other than the
sort of DLC approach to it but cutting
out the holes for airflow because it's
already got some decent sized holes in
the top and bottom should help
significantly with that and the p400 as
I understand it is one of the best
selling cases that on the market right
now I think in general so modified
version from CyberPower unfortunately if
you like the P 400 and you had similar
airflow concerns as we did if you want
it it's the P 418
and you can buy it from CyberPower
because it's an exclusive product so not
on new I Graham is on or anything like
that for just the case unless you want
to buy the whole system there and then
two more cases so there's the cube which
it's a you probably recognize it looks a
bit like the omen but a smaller cube
shaped case it's sitting on a stand you
can take it off the stand if you really
wanted to and run it flat just sort of a
unique form factor that we've seen once
or twice but it is more of a looker case
so the only criticism I have of that is
somewhat resolved by moving the fans
internally so in the current
configuration the fans are mount on the
outside of the case there's about one to
two millimeters of space between the fan
of the glass so not much air can get
through there the fans aren't really
doing anything a lot of static pressure
but if you move them internally which
there is space for that would resolve
the concern there otherwise it is called
the the cube I think it's a cyber cube
not a cyber power it's a sister brand of
cyber power and then finally there's the
Aluna cases and these are just sort of
cool they're interesting again it's
another one of those you can't buy it
DIY cases which like I get it I get why
I sighs need some custom cases but also
every time we see these things like man
I wish that were available on the market
standalone the Aluna though so it's a
closed-off front before anyone goes and
posts comments about like no airflow the
approach they're doing is side intake
which we've seen in the past it
successfully works and actually in order
for site intake to work properly you
should have the front as closed as
possible because if the Front's open
what's gonna happen is not on this case
but the air will come in the side and a
lot of its gonna escape out the front
before it ever gets to a component but
with the way the Aluna case is set up in
theory you should be able to just blast
it into the panel and then it'll
redirect towards wherever the next
pressure system is which is gonna be the
fans on the GP or the CPU so a pretty
interesting case visually and take some
design cues that we've seen recently
from other cases thorne will take for
example Lian Li all going for side
intake as a unique approach to cooling
but I think other than that that should
have should just about cover the
CyberPower suite so as always thank you
