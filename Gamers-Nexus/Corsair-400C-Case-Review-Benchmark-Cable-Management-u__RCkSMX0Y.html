with 70 to 100 dollar mid towers that
share a few similar features like power
supply shrouds minimalistic drive
support and generally a move away from
five and a quarter base this is a trend
that we think started with the NZXT eh
440 a couple years ago and it has
persisted through the fantex Eclipse P
400 which is brand new rose Wells new
gun near case the NZXT s340 and now
course has 400 C which is what we're
reviewing today all of these cases have
a sort of unique take on the idea of a
mid tower in the $7,200 range with a
power supply shroud and cleaner cable
management and today we are looking at
Corsairs take on that idea Corsair is
400 C follows hot on the heels of its
600 C launch both fronting a similarly
clean exterior but drastically different
under the hood reviewed the 600 C
favorably for it's risky take on
inverted motherboard installation and
further praised the 600 C for a
chart-topping GPU cooling performance
the 400 C is similar really only in
appearance
internally the $90 400 C and 400 q cases
host a more traditional motherboard
mount they remove optical drive bays
that were in the 600 C and shrink the
overall size of the case by a couple of
inches check the article in description
below for more specifics on the case
internals the test methodology and
aesthetics discussion Corsairs 400 C is
targeted at the sub $100 market landing
itself amongst a herd of similarly
priced similarly designed alternatives
the s 340 has been around for a while
now and is a staple case for mid towers
and the fan tax Eclipse P 400 is brand
new as as Roseville's gun near and they
all have common design interests common
price for the most part and different
implementations of power supply shrouds
and cable management features Corsair
however makes the biggest claims with
regard to functionality and cooling
performance in this review we're looking
at ease of installation at thermal
performance of CPU and GPU temperatures
on the diode level and then we also have
some unique tests that I think a lot of
other sites won't offer and that's
because we tested almost every possible
air cooling configuration in here do not
do the liquid stuff but tested the case
fan placement check for optimal fan
placement if you add another fan and we
learned a bit along the way about
air coolers tower coolers and blower
fans interact with one another
in a case like this mid tower case
starting with the basics the 400 C
abandons optical drive sport moves the
3.5 inch drive cages to the bottom front
of the case concealed partly by the
two-piece power supply shroud the shroud
somewhat reminds us of the half X and
its original one-piece shroud and it's
not riveted to the case with the 400
seats just two plastic components that
lock together for better cable
concealment you can remove these if you
want to coarser intelligently positions
a PCIe routing hole in the top of the
PSU shroud allowing direct and clean GPU
wiring unfortunately a few issues do
stem from this region of the case the
first is with 180 millimeter or larger
PS use and Corsair correctly advertises
that the 400 C can support 180
millimeter PS use like our test PSU and
actually will support a bit larger but
the 3.5 inch hard drive cage must be
removed to adequately support our 180
millimeter modular PSU the cables were
pinched right against the cages and were
unusable until the removal of those
cages once gone we're left to rely upon
the 3 2.5 inch SSD sleds on the rear of
the motherboard tray since there is no
additional 3.5 inch drive support
throughout the case but this was okay
because we're actually pretty impressed
with Corsairs 2.5 inch drive sled and as
trivial a thin as it is the
spring-loaded action and general design
of the sled allows for very easy
installation and an overall improve the
user experience this is something we
hope will be adopted as the case
industry moves forward with these types
of cases the 400 CS PSU shroud also
proved restrictive with front io
connectors we had to route the cabling
above the PSU shroud which is
functionally fine but a little bit
uglier Corsair could improve this by
lengthening the cables to better support
motherboards which inset the FPC or it
can shorten the PSU shroud lengths
marginally so that the cables don't get
as pinched and make it difficult to
close the power supply shroud and latch
it together stock cooling is simplified
to a set of two fans one 140 millimeter
and one 120 millimeter fan in the rear
and that shoots a straight line of air
from the front and out the back because
the 400 C is at PSU shroud has been
shifted to the bottom and that means
that all the
is basically up at the top of this case
so you can do two top mounted fans in
the top if you wanted to add one 40s or
fit larger radiators to 40 to 80
included and we tested a few non stock
configurations with these top mounted
fans and a second front mounted fan to
determine which setup made the best
sense when looking at CPU and GPU
thermals time to start talking about
cooling for the full methodology hit the
link in the description below to learn
about how we do these tests and check
out the greater details that may not be
revealed in this video what we're
looking at today includes CPU and GPU
diode temperatures we're also measuring
the impact of fans as placed in
different locations of the case and then
we'll do a comparative analysis toward
the end against the other similarly
priced cases on the market let's start
with our 400 C specific test for optimal
case fan placement you can see a quick
chart of what we tested here but it's
perhaps a bit more clear on the website
our range for these tests is just 4.0 7
Celsius so that's a forty three point
six to thirty nine point five three
Celsius range and all in all a fairly
inconsequential performance impact but
the world of cooling is often a fight
for single degree gains if that so a
single degree is a pretty big deal with
these cases the stock configuration
performs only marginally worse than
mounting an additional 140 millimeter
fan in the front and that's aligned with
the GPU so it makes sense
optimal CPU cooling scenarios all center
around intake heavy set ups with one
rear fan still mounted top exhaust
setups actually end up siphoning fresh
cool intake from the CPU before the air
ever hits the tower cooler and that
effectively suffocates the CPU for a
constant flow of cool air from the front
intake
despite its to insignificance for CPU
thermals adding the lower mounted 140
millimeter intake fan noticeably
improved GPU cooling performance within
the 400 C a delta of two point six six
Celsius or four point six four percent
difference and this is the best possible
configuration for raw GPU thermals note
that ours uses a blower fan so may vary
if you have push fans this is the
configuration we'd probably recommend as
they go to just add in one extra 140
millimeter in the front bottom intake
interestingly dumping more cool air into
the system from the top doesn't further
improve
GPU thermals there's an improvement over
stock but GP temps actually increase
slightly from the 140 millimeter front
intake addition configuration and this
is because the top intake fans assist in
dissipating heat from the tower cooler
which is reflected in diminished CPU
thermals but as a result that he gets
pushed down and into the back of the GPU
if you're adding one fan we think it
makes the most sense to place that fan
in the front bottom slot moving on to
the comparative analysis we look at the
400cc the fan tax eclipsed p400
brand-new case NZXT is staple s340 the
Rosewell gun near also new and then
we've included course there's $150 600 c
because although it's a different market
it's tied by family to the 400 c so we
want to see a comparison of how these
two differ when it comes to the 160 ish
dollar price difference and to the size
difference in the 400 c the 600 c shows
a 5.25% advantage of the corsair 400 C
with the entire chart demonstrating a
range of 3.25 Celsius the 400 seat runs
at 58 point six zero Celsius for the GPU
but has a slightly hotter idle than it's
nearby competition at four point nine
seven Celsius competing cases operate
idle at three point one five C to four
point two to C for the GPU this is
effectively inconsequential to basically
all users and seems like result of the
stock intakes fan positioning that's
what's causing this difference for CPU
thermals we again see higher idle
temperatures than some competitors the s
340 runs a bit warm a trend for an z
axis recent and steel heavy cases but
load temperatures are fully acceptable
at forty one point four seven Celsius in
fact CPU load thermals for the 400 C
planted firmly above its same priced
competition
beaten out in this chart only by Corsair
zone 600 see the chart range is 3.2 on
Celsius load with a 400 C versus s 340
load Delta of just 1.0 8% which is
wholly imperceptible and the fan tax
Eclipse P 400 has a slightly more
noticeable gain so you see the 400 C
outperforming the fan tax eclipsed P 400
by three point six five percent again
favoring the 400 C so that's still small
but it is certainly more noticeable than
the 1.0 eight percent of the s 340 the
Corsair 400 C has a
I build quality over all strong assembly
and uses good materials it's got
superior cooling performance to all of
the cases we tested that are similar to
this one other than of course coarser
600 C which is a bit more expensive and
overall it's a pretty good case to build
with there are a few complaints we had
the main one being the power supply
limitation so if you're running a 180 or
larger PSU you are going to encounter
some issues with the harddrive cages so
do keep that in mind you may actually
want to downsize your PSU if you haven't
bought it yet the other thing in terms
of build quality this front panel uses
little plastic clips that are very easy
to snap off from just one or two removal
cycles if you're not very careful and
that is something we've seen with these
similar clips on coarser cases in the
past something that bike course start to
do would be to adopt something like the
Manta mounting mechanism which you can
see in our article no Manta and that
uses basically reinforced pegs rather
than these sort of clips that you
depress to get out of the case and
they're much stronger it's easier to pop
on and off there's less fear of damaging
something so that is a major point of
improvement I think Corsair should look
toward in the future and I don't mean
there's a little alligator clips that
pinch either those won't really fix the
issue the side window is pretty nice I
do like these sort of larger wide
form-factor side windows it gives a good
look at the inside the case there's no
restrictions in terms of visibility do
the hard drive cages but the one thing
that is a bit annoying is when you're
building the case the side panel is
hinged so it can't be completely removed
and that's obviously a little bit
annoying when it's out on a table
requires 2 times the space because
you've got the hinges door hanging out
there but very small because one how
often are you going to be rebuilding
these cases anyway and 2 how often are
you going to be opening that side window
the Corsair 400 C case does have pretty
good thermals it's imperceptible to the
general user in terms of differences
between this case and the others on the
bench actually imperceptible to
basically all users but it is superior
in that regard so we have to give it
credit for that build quality other than
the few complaints mentioned is fairly
high and overall the case is on
in terms of its appearances but I will
let you decide if you like it or not
from the b-roll that's really what the
video is for anyway
so overall $90 does put it a bit above
the nearby competition I would strongly
suggest researching the NZXT s340 the
fantex p400 new eclipse case and then
you could look at some other cases -
like the 600 C The Rose won't come near
I suppose is worth looking at while
you're in there but the main ones would
be the s 340 and the 400 C and then you
make your decision on those based really
mostly on what you think looks the best
because in terms of cooling they're
fairly similar in terms of build and
installation and features they're fairly
similar so it's mostly going to come
down to aesthetics and that is wholly up
to you to decide thank you all for
