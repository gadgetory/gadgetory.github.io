nexus dotnet and we are still at CES go
figure it is going on and on i am here
looking at some new visiontek hardware
this is actually an R 9290 that as you
can tell has been pretty heavily
modified so we actually have an EK
solutions liquid block on here and and
this of course replacing the normal very
large reference heatsink that has been
having some difficulties and review
samples so just to give you a quick idea
of what's going on here we have a full
block with an acrylic cover so it does
have kind of a coolness factor there so
you can see your liquid running through
there if you configure your system
properly the back we have a full back
plate which will of course help keep
your card in theory help keep your card
straight so there's no bowing of the PCB
and it also helps with cooling the vrm
and the memory the the actual flash
modules on the board because they are
not liquid cooled under the the rest of
this block as the GPU is in terms of the
actual specs this is a normal r9 290
except it's been pre overclocked so this
this particular model is generally
overclocked at 1175 megahertz and we've
got a memory clock speed of 14 50
megahertz and that is against I don't
have the 290 stats with me here but I do
have the 290x stats with me and the 290x
has a GPU clock of 1000 mega Hertz again
against the 1175 of their pre
overclocked r9 290 and the 290x has a
memory clock speed of 1250 against the
200 megahertz higher r9 a cryo venom
overclock speed so with that in mind
this card this card has an MSRP of five
hundred fifty dollars and that's about a
hundred dollars more than the normal r9
290 with the air cooler on it but it
does perform about 40 degrees Celsius
cooler pretty big difference so again to
give you an idea of the r9 290x on at
load performs that around 94 degrees c
and this cryo venom card by visiontek
the r9 290 that is overclocked of course
runs around 51 degrees c at load so that
kind of gives you an idea of what's
going on here i've been told this is
already available and it is actually
hand-built
in the US so if you order it takes about
five to eight days to actually get the
product built and shipped to you and
that's because their hand testing it and
they're actually doing pressure tests
and they're doing a FPS test so pretty
cool stuff there it does ship in one of
these fancy crates down on the floor and
yeah that's that's the r9 290 it is
called the cryo venom card links for
