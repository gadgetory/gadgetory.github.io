to a booth now and I've basically taken
their entire booth and put it in front
of me here knocked oh it has a ton of
stuff for the show we're going to go
through about 50% of it most of it's on
the PC side a couple of updates on the
chrome ax line D fifteens
actually fan sizes for the new fan that
everyone's been talking about so we go
about all that today along with a couple
of prototypes that they've printed or
they've CNC milled before that this
video is brought to you by thermal takes
view 37 case the vo 37 focuses on
highlighting custom PC builds with its
full panoramic window and tinted front
acrylic and our thermal testing the view
37 performed reasonably well when
considering its looks focused build
which is partly thanks to the air flow
design and the removal of a bottom power
supply shroud for a balance of looks and
performance check the link in the
description below for the view 37 so
let's start with the chromatics line
everybody is always making fun of
Knoxville for the fan colors it's an old
joke at this point so they said alright
you know what fine we'll make a black
fan so they made a black fan everyone
wanted the black fan so naktu ran into a
problem where people are buying their
coolers with the brown fans and
replacing them with the black ones and
you end up with just excess fans so now
they're going to be selling all the same
coolers from the rest of the char
they're three of them d15 is one of them
and selling it just like the original no
changes to anything except it's all
black out in terms of thermal
performance adding powder coating to it
shouldn't really matter you're talking
less than one degree of difference so if
you're worried if you're if you're down
in the comments already typing angrily
about the performance just stop because
it's powder coated it's a really thin
powder coating typically the change in
thermal performance is minimal so
basically if you wanted a complete
blackout everything blackout fan clips
blackout fan blackout fins blackout
mounting points and mounting hardware
they're gonna be making them in the
chromatic series pretty easy update
there other than that couple of updates
on things like actually this cooler here
behind me so Knox what has a fantastic
set up right now it's I mean we're not
in a lab so it's not perfect but these
are Ben's top power supplies we've
showed you them with our fantastic
so been sought PS use here and then
right here are just too many chambers
that are just acrylic chamber so they
have a d15 and they have the next
generation you 12 behind me so basically
what Knox was showing is a 120
millimeter with the new fan and some
redesign on the heatsink versus the D 15
as we all know it no changes to that one
between them there's they're both
sitting on top of dummy heaters so it's
just like a plate metal plate basically
with a heating element in it pretty
standard way to approach a thermal test
for coolers because having a whole
computers way too many variables can't
really control it so they just have
heating elements in here they're heated
to the same temperature I'd say more
than 200 watt heat load so it's a
substantial amount of heat load and then
a k-type thermocouple reader behind me
so the K types are hooked up to the
plates and Beach right now it's forty
nine point one versus forty eight point
seven degrees within variance K types
have a an error of two point two degrees
variance Perfect's error basically
between them manufacturing tolerances so
I don't know if they've calibrated but
either way let's say they did you're
within a one degree of reason given it's
a non lab environment so they've more or
less achieved d15 performance with the
new u 12 with a 200 plus y heat load
it's significant
it's sort of a EDT area except maybe the
thread Ripper two might be a bit higher
at 250 watts which i think of this is
pretty close to so yeah that's
impressive it's basically using new fans
where's old fans and then in terms of
the heatsink design it's 37 percent more
surface area so it's fatter that's where
a lot of your performance comes from
it's got more dissipation area and then
the airflow obviously from the new fan
helps out so that's a next-generation
you 12 don't have pricing or anything
like that on it it might be about a
hundred dollars and what I'm told it
comes with two fans but that's all I
know right now hopefully launches before
end of year for the next-gen you twelve
might be early next year but that's kind
of what they're looking at right now
other things that you might be
interested in would be this so this
clear piece of plastic here in front of
me is the new fan for the 120 except
printed in 140 millimeter format or CNC
stations
so everyone's been asking out where's
the 140s from what I understand it's not
quite as simple as just scaling up you
could scale up a fan design
nakta what tells me that they're pushing
for the most possible performance out of
it so they're more or less refactoring
the design for every size that they make
and it's taking so long to make 140 so
things that have to change our curvature
of the blades the account of blades
what's an optimal amount of blades on it
and material properties material exact
material should all stay the same from
the 120s so that's good they get to
carry over all that R&amp;amp;D for years it's
just scaling up to 140 size so that it
actually performs at I guess peak
performance trying to squeeze out every
percent of improvement they can out of
it so this is coming they've made
prototypes of it
if you've wanted a 140 it's just it's
not here yet there's also a low profile
version so this is also 140 it's just
thinner not much to say other than that
a couple of there updates on coolers the
Redux line here is basically a slightly
cheaper version of the normal line with
a gray fan so it's reduced packaging
fewer accessories drives down the MSRP
and that's the Redux nhe 12 which is
coming out soon and then this one here
is a next-generation 140 millimeter you
type cooler so we've talked about you
14s before I think the last time we
talked about EU 14 OCT 12 was thread
Ripper probably and/or am 4 maybe and
with the u 14 it's about 30% more
service area so just like this u 12
behind me except not 37 percent 30% more
and I think they're going with new fans
on it so it'll be expensive because the
new fans are expensive don't have a
price yet don't have a release date yet
but basically it's just a really fat u14
cooler with a new fan like really fat
substantial cooler so that'll be new and
then the next-gen D 15 is also here in
front of me also going to be using new
the new fans and also a bit of changes
it's got one more heat pipe on it don't
have any idea what the price is gonna be
on that and I think this there's one
more to talk about here this will only
interest a few of you I think in our
audience but this is a C type course is
this a 140 millimeter C type it's a
couple millimeters shorter than the
vs1 that's the change for this current
generation and I think that pretty much
covers all the knock to a stop so as
