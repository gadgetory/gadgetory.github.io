MSI 1070 TI duke card i have not worked
with any of their cards from the duke
line in a while but this is a new one so
this is a I think they're officially
calling this a try froze or cooler now
as opposed to Twin Frozr it's got three
fans the third one over hands the PCB a
bit which allows it to push air
obviously through and pass the PCB and
we're gonna take it apart and see what
it looks like underneath look at the VR
mmm
look at the cooling solution and all
that this one is about MSRP it's about
four hundred and seventy four hundred
eighty dollars so a bit below ten eighty
a bit above reference card and the 1070
TI just to reiterate in our review we
think that it's it's sort of a
misunderstood card
the initial rhetoric around the 1070 TI
was why does this thing exist there's a
1080 there's 1070 we kind of are of the
opinion that like in my review of it
that the 1070 I as long as it's 452 474
$80.00 it makes more sense than 1080 s
because they're roughly the same
performance and you can overclock it in
five minutes and get equivalent
performance even with an overclocked
1080 so we're gonna take this one apart
today before that this video is brought
to you by thermal Grizzly makers of the
conductor hot liquid metal that we
recently used to drop 20 degrees off of
our coffee leak temperatures thermal
grizzly also makes traditional thermal
compounds we use on top of the IHS like
cryo not and hydronaut pastes learn more
at the link below so starting now
externally with the cooler it is a three
fan design and these are smaller fans
they are not the usual 90 to 100
millimeter fans that the Twin Frozr
coolers have they're a bit smaller than
that so if we do a quick measurement of
these fans we will get let's see roughly
how big they are it's about 85 85 so
that means in in marketing materials
they're gonna call that 90 because
that's probably about 90 yeah so about
85 millimeters call it 90 and the usual
Twin Frozr fans are a little bit bigger
than this I think there are a hundred
millimeter
these days so they do run a bit larger
than these fans do but there's three of
these so you can't fit too large or 100
millimeter fans with them for power it's
got a six and an eight it's got a
traditional back blade some LEDs no bio
switch so there's no dual BIOS lots of
just Phillips screws it looks like and
then we've got some heat pipes and a
standard heat sink over there so pretty
much seen the whole cart at this point
let's take it apart and get the actual
details for this I am going to be using
our anti-static mod mat because now that
it is cold and dry we are routinely
shocking things in the studio like
actually not even from just advertising
our own product perspective we are
legitimately particularly Andrew you
have a camera camera particularly Andrew
behind the camera we're shocking every
tripod every table but that's where the
wrist strap has come in actually quite
handy we've got the anti-static mod mat
on stored on cameras Nexus Donette / mod
mat if you would like one and cold and
dry as the weather that harbors static
electricity so we're gonna be a bit
safer today than normally okay so all
those screws I just took out including
this one are going through the back
plate through the PCB where's the
unthreaded part and then into the base
plate so these are retaining the base
plate to the card as well as the back
plate now we need to remove the cooling
portion so we got the four standard
spring tension screws for that warranty
Boyd sticker which are awful and not
really enforceable in a lot of places so
oK we've removed the backplate this is
another one of those where it's not
gonna do a ton for you in terms of heat
transfer because there's really no way
to transfer the heat to the plate it's
just there for looks primarily this is
not a thermally conductive surface it's
coated for a few reasons primarily that
they're probably trying to avoid direct
shorts by bridging any of the pins but a
thermal pad in there would do a whole
lot of good to transfer heat so not
particularly effective as a cooling
solution but then again not a lot of hot
components on the back of the card so
let's see if they are somewhat redeemed
on the front of the card where it really
counts and we've got a couple of fans
are gonna have to disconnect first okay
I was trivial alright so twin solution
and base plate and we'll take this off
in a moment but let's take a look first
so a capacitor bank most of it other
than the last cap and the last joke most
of the cap Bank and the inductor line do
have thermal pads that as you can see by
the impressions from the lines going
down them they do contact the heatsink
before someone says wait a minute
there's not a lot of surface area there
all you're doing is contacting the fins
that doesn't do anything it actually
does quite a lot we tested this with the
EVGA ACX cards with a thermal pad mod
around this no actually end of year 2016
we tested that and it matters this helps
a lot I mean it's better than air air is
not really thermally conductive you're
at like 0.2 0.2 4 watts per meter Kelvin
at 25 C whereas aluminium you're gonna
be upwards of 200
so it's certainly better than then
nothing or then just err and you can see
that they also contact the heat pipes a
bit which is probably the most helpful
as those are going to be what does your
phase change so it helps it probably a
bit better to have a flat plate but
depends on how much the airflow matters
here versus just straight contact to
pull heat away and we'll know more about
that once we look at the vrm components
so yeah they do actually have those
contacting the heatsink which is
something I was genuinely worried about
until just now because some of the
cheaper ramesside cards in the past like
the armor which uses a great PCB they
don't do a great job at ensuring contact
between electrical or power components
and heat sinks so that's that's done at
least reasonably this is just looks like
for vibration damping or potentially
reducing coil whine although I would say
probably vibration damping for the most
part as far as the rest of the
components we have an LED cable and a
fan cable got some grease leeching
around the outside of the substrate and
what is this doing all right so that
hook is going in here into this sort of
socket and it's got a rubber finish on
it so it's not really for thermal
transfer that's not to improve transfer
to this flat then it's just probably for
vibration damping and physical support
of the heatsink would be my guess and
and reduce any unwanted noises from the
fans
other than those you know we need to get
underneath the base plate the base plate
has some minimal level of surface area
not a whole lot though it's it's
certainly helpful to have but it's not a
not the best base plate we've seen this
is also a cheaper card as far as cards
go these days it's not like the high-end
icx cards that kind of cost a lot more
and have the pin fins the MSI lightning
does the same idea with the smaller fins
on the base plate
so we've got our memory modules as
expected that contact the aluminum base
plate nothing special there so let's
kind of move this to the side so for the
vrm we'll talk about this more on the
review of the card but this is using
eight of the silicon ik's
ZF 9:06 MOSFETs which are integrated
high and low side dual FETs
and then there are two more MOSFETs over
here for the memory and we're going to
talk about the layout and the phase
design in the review if builds or
doesn't do a standalone video for us
kind of depends on how interesting he
thinks the card is so very basics of VR
I'm there talk about that more later
first sean's if you wanted to short them
we've got a couple options and actually
we can check where they go so there's
one shunt here there's another one here
my guess is that this shunt goes to that
power connector this one probably goes
to that one there's another shunt down
here that's gonna cover us for the most
part it looks like yes so that'll cover
the shunts let me okay so what we're
gonna do here now is just double check
and see where the shunts go this is
pretty easy we explained it in our Titan
V shunt shorting mod but if you missed
that it's the same process here so I'm
going to check for resistance using just
a cheap digital multimeter we don't need
anything too accurate because all we're
checking for is a zero value or a non
zero value and if we look at the side
over here of the mod mat I'll show you
what we need to check so we need to
check for a 12-volt line which is any of
these yellow lines this is on our mat
we've got GQ power here for these two so
a six fit pin we've got the lower three
for the eight pin we've got these three
so we need to check one of those and
then check that against either side of
the shunt so let's just go ahead and do
that now
so I'm gonna try and sneak this down to
that second leg as opposed to the green
one green ones a sense so we don't want
to hit that okay so
this is a zero value so this shot does
go to this six pin it zeros out when I
measure it and then for this one over
here we're also getting a zero when we
measure it it's just a trick of being
able to get in there and hit the contact
so we're zeroing out here it's your
resistance they are these shots are
basically as we explained in the shunt
shorting video they're in line with the
power line so this shunt is in line with
that eight pin this one's in line is
that six pin if you put some liquid
metal atop each of these you can short
them out and that will trick the card
into thinking it's pulling less current
than it is the more liquid metal you put
the more you are changing the resistance
which will impact how much more current
it can draw if you put too much liquid
metal or you do a direct short with a
copper wire for example then dependently
gauge of the wire the length of it you
could end up forcing the card into 2d
clocks because it'll go into safety mode
but that'd be what you'd short if you
wanted to short it out and trick it into
drawing more power and pushing more
current down the rails so that is the
msi 1070 TI duke card we're going to try
and review this one CES is coming up
very soon so we'll see what happens with
that but we'll try and look at it for
sure it's mostly just a question of the
thermal performance at this point that's
really all that matters with these cards
so taking it apart will allow us to put
thermocouples on the VRMs and see how it
does cooling those compared to its
competition and as always if you want
