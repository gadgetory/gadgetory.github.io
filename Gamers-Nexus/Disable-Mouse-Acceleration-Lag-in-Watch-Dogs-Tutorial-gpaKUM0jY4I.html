Nexus dotnet and today we are going to
play around with the watchdogs
configuration file first I'm I'm just
going to show you how to disable the
worst invention ever to come to PC
gaming mouse acceleration and second we
will disable mouse smoothing which
happens to be the second worst invention
ever to come to PC gaming so these
actually make some sense when you're
using a controller with analog input but
with a high precision Mouse it's
actually pretty detrimental to gameplay
and your ability to aim so what you need
to do is open up this file that we have
right here called gamer profile dot XML
and that is done by let me just pull
over our trusty Windows browser here
that is done by navigating to home path
slash documents slash my games slash
watchdogs and once you're there you will
see this file that looks like a bunch of
gibberish I promise you it is not in
fact gibberish it means something to
someone so we go into that and then you
have gamer profile dot XML and you can
open this in notepad or in notepad plus
plus that I have here it's going to be
the same no matter what if you open it
in notepad it's just gonna be black text
instead of this nicely formatted text
with plus plus so what you need to do
now is do do a search for the phrase
smoothing or smoothness sorry
so find smoothness and you'll see it's
right here highlighted as a1 so what you
need to do is set smoothness to zero
from one that will disable some of the
mouse moving go over to the left option
or wherever it is in your editor and
locate use it Mouse smooth and make sure
it is set to zero
from one so make sure that's set to zero
and then you need to find sensitivity
which is over here on the far left
you'll see mine is currently set to
point nine because I was testing it
yours might be a little bit lower or
higher set sensitivity once again to one
from whatever it is and that will make
sure you've got more of a one one input
to
gay movement ratio so it's not gonna be
as awkward when you're moving them out
so that will disable Mouse smoothing and
Mouse acceleration there's still a
little bit of funkiness when you're
aiming in the game because they have a
couple of other things going on but
unfortunately we can't change this
configuration file save the file so just
do a ctrl s and then once it's saved and
closed what you might want to do is
right-click on the file and click on
properties and once you've got that open
go down here to attributes and tick
read-only and hit apply and close and
that'll make sure watchdogs does not
overwrite the file when you open the
game you'll have to disable read-only
next time you want to edit it so keep
that in mind if you're having difficulty
editing in the future so that's all for
this video and this tutorial please let
me know if you have any other questions
about other things you can do for
watchdogs or other games please
subscribe if you like this and we will
see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
