hardcore overclocking and today we're
taking a look at the Nvidia Tyson V PCB
so you know without any delay let's get
right into it we'll start with the
various VRMs that are located on the
card and then we're gonna go into some
of the details for the vcore vrm the HBM
vrm and also how you could lift the
power limit on this thing because well
it chokes on the power limit pretty hard
out of the box even after you increase
it you know to the limit that the
software allows that this card is still
very very very very power limited as in
video opening allows you to increase the
stock power limit by another 20% before
we get into those this coverage is
brought to you by EVGA and their 1080
tee is c2 which we've recommended fairly
highly for its build quality and the icx
sensors which are kind of fun to play
with you can check our full sc2 review
for the 1080i if you're curious to learn
more or you can click the link in the
description below to find the product
page for the 1080i sc2 anyway let's get
into the VRMs starting with the very
oddly laid out V core vrm so you get one
set of phases for v core right here and
then you go across the card and get
another set of phases for v core on the
other side this vrm layout is you know
as pretty much optimal it gets the vrm
as close to the load which would be the
GPU here as is possible for a you know
PCB format of this kind and the reason
why getting the vrm as close to the GPU
core as possible is important is that
well the less distance the current from
the vrm has to travel the less voltage
drop you get across the power plane and
the better you get an better transient
response you get because obviously if
there's a big change in power
consumption from the GPU core that
change in current demand has to take
some time to propagate so the longer
your power plane is the bigger the delay
between the current draw from the GPU
core and it getting to the actual
capacity
banks and the inductors which results in
slightly worse voltage regulation
so this vrm layout is definitely really
really good behind that we find the V
the HBM vrm now the HBM vrm has kind of
where the V curve erm sort of got layout
PCB layout priority the HBM v RM is
actually behind the V Corps V RMS one of
the V Corps Buffay you know parts of the
V Corps v RM this is really awkward for
me to deal with because most cards you
just have one big block even if that
block might not necessarily you know
like Vega has an L shape but this is two
separate blocks but the HBM erm is
located behind one of the sets of ecore
phases and this does actually negatively
impact the voltage drop from the HBM v
RM luckily the HBM isn't super you know
high power draw or anything so it's not
you know it's not as critical to have
the HBM v RM as close to the card as
possible but it is noticeable as the
voltage coming out of the HP mprm is
pretty high considering what actually
ends up getting to the HBM stacks that
you have on the GPU so you know that's
the HBM v RM and then you get the 2
minor v rms up here so this one and this
one we will not be going into the
details of these i'm not actually sure
which one does what but basically this
card requires two more voltages in order
to function one of them is the PEX
voltage this is typically between 0.9
volts and 1 volt this powers the PCI
interface as well as some of the PLL's
inside the GPU core this voltage is
completely useless on air cooling I mean
obviously the card won't work without it
but worrying about tweaking this voltage
is pointless it doesn't it won't help
you overclock any higher the other world
did you get is the 1.8 volts VPP as well
as bias voltage so Nvidia cards have a
the bios system on and video cards runs
on 1.8 volts the HBM also has a
supporting voltage of 1.8 volts this is
similar to gddr5 XO
is not a huge difference from what you
would normally see on an nvidia card so
those are your two minor rails I'm not
sure which one does what
but there's go these have to be present
on this card to function another
interesting thing you kind of find on
this PCB is well is these two groups of
four MOSFETs right here I am NOT one
like I do not have confirmation on what
these actually do and unfortunately the
card is in the US and I'm in the I'm in
the you know in Europe so I've not had a
chance to probe this myself and well
trying trying to get you know long range
measurements just does not work for
these kinds of things so I'm not a
hundred percent certain what these do
but based on the fact that there's an
inductor right in front of them and that
they're well you know between the PCIe
eight pins and the V curve erm I have a
sneaking suspicion that Nvidia these
might be actual sort of sub V RMS which
would be used for boosting vrm
efficiency because when you have well
basically we are converting doing DC DC
voltage conversions from say 12 volts to
anything less than 1.2 volts
tends to be pretty inefficient due to
the very low duty cycle that you end up
running and you know the G V 100 here it
runs on voltages anywhere from 0.75
volts at full load to 1.09 3 volts full
load so it's very much in that sort of
it's outside the sweet spot for your 12
volts down conversion and Intel for
example deals with this on their mult
very high core count Zeon's which run on
very low voltage very high current they
deal with that by having a fully
integrated voltage regulator into and
video doesn't have one so what I assume
they're doing is there this this set of
MOSFETs right here and this inductor
basically would step down 12 volts to
something like 8 volts and that would
slightly boost the actual efficiency of
the main V curve erm without really
costing you a lot of
power because this is a low current erm
high voltage high voltage output so this
can be very efficient without too much
difficulty and it could significantly
improve the actual efficiency of the
conversion of the of the B curve erm but
without the card in hand I I can't say
for sure that that's exactly what it
does but you do get two of these which
would nicely line up with the fact that
you have to you know power connectors so
yeah just that's just my theory on what
they do I'm not 100% certain so with
that out of the way let's get right into
the actual sort of meat of this which is
the details of the vcore vrm and the HBM
erm so the vcore vrm is an absolute
monstrosity it may look like a one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen
sixteen phase V core vrm design however
it's not actually a sixteen phase at
least not with the way it's driven you
do have sixteen inductors you do have 16
power stages you do not have sixteen
interleaved PWM signals back of the card
here you can actually see that the card
has mounts for PWM doubler chips but
they're unoccupied so this card how it
deals with the vrm is that assume this
voltage controller right here is 4 v
core unfortunately Nvidia decided that
the voltage controllers on this card are
two over the same chip so I'm not sure
which one does what because either it
could drive either vrm they both have
the right phase counts for it but either
way this is a monolithic power systems
which I'm just going to abbreviate as
MPs which is their company logo this is
an MP 2 8 8 8 I'm not sure about the
feature set of these chips I do know
they do go up to 8 phase v r8 phase
output and they do switching frequencies
in excess of
300 kilohertz however there is no public
data sheet so I can't really give you
any details on what other features these
offer but either way on this card they
are running you know one of them is
running eight phase-- mode 300 kilohertz
for the beaker of erm the other one is
running two-phase mode for the HBM but
basically the card is essentially a
massive eight phase because of the lack
of doublers so normally if you had a
doubling scheme you basically would have
a PWM signal is getting multiplied into
sixteen by the actual doublers and here
what you get is you basically have eight
PWM signals and well if we have like say
we have one PWM signal go here pw1 one
then that signal also goes to want one
other chip so essentially why this looks
like an eight phase-- is that you have
two phases turn on at the same time
however this does still have benefits
the huge number of power stages and
inductors means you get very good
thermal performance because the vrm is
absolutely like it has a huge amount of
surface area the other thing is the
actual power stages are extremely
high-end and you basically cut the
current load on each power stage in half
by basically having two of them turn on
at the same time so the this vrm is it
ends up being ridiculously powerful
because these aren't any old you know
any old power stages now these are
Fairchild Semiconductor my C is terrible
so these are Fairchild Semiconductor FD
mf3 one seventies and the thing is these
are 70 amp smart power stages so just
SPS for short and the reason why these
are well so they're 70 amps max output
well they won't actually shut down at 70
amps they shut down at 80 amps so that's
part of the smart power stage
functionality they have a
an overcurrent protection of 8880 amps
and they have a built-in over
temperature protection of a hundred and
thirty six degrees centigrade so
basically once they hit one hundred and
thirty six degrees centigrade they raise
our flag that hey the vrm is kind of
overheating here you might want to shut
it down the OCP on the other hand shuts
down the power stage the moment the
current value is exceeded for the time
period specified in the datasheet so
basically you don't have to worry about
this vrm you know destroying itself or
anything because it has built-in
temperature monitoring built-in current
monitoring and built-in protection
features right on the power stages
themselves they are capable of
sustaining up to 70 amps output however
at that point their heat output is about
14 watts each which you know that's just
unsustainable so if you had one of these
chips and a big enough heatsink for it
yeah you could actually push 70 amps
through it in a 16 phase vrm design on a
cramped PCB like this that is not gonna
work
luckily the Titan V doesn't really pull
that much power it does do it very low
voltages but it really doesn't pull that
much power on the stock power limit
you're only looking at about 200 amps
coming through the vrm because I'm
assuming there's another 50 watts of
power dedicated rest to the rest of the
PCB and you're looking at about you know
so you're looking at about 200 watts
going into the GPU core which around 1
volt works out to about 200 amps current
output obviously at the lower voltages
it would actually be more current output
on the with the power limit max out so
with plus 20% power limit you're gonna
be looking at the whole card pulling
about 300 watts I'm gonna assume that is
still pulling the same amount of power
for the fan and the HBM because we're
only looking at the core power
consumption here because the route I'm
that's an assumption but is it probably
a pretty good one in general that works
out and then with the lifted + 20% power
limit you basically be looking at
something like 250 amps output for the
core vrm which for these monstrously
overpowered smart power stages
is really not a workout which is really
really good because it means this vrm
ends up being ridiculously efficient and
in fact it ends up being a ridiculous
overkill I think this might be because
the this PCB is probably used for tests
laws as well that go into outright data
centers and well data centers want
tip-top reliability so you know anything
less than massive overkill is just kind
of not acceptable there so the end
result is that at these typical current
figures both that around one volt output
because really the on stock the voltage
output and fluctuates so much it's
really hard to say and on on the plus
20% power limit actually ends up
hovering around point 0.99 three volts
well I'd like to say at 1 volt you know
for these current outputs I have actual
heat dissipation numbers for these power
stages unfortunately the datasheet for
these power stages does not specify how
output voltage impacts efficiency so the
datasheet is entirely SPECT at 1.8 volts
however at 1.8 volts 200 amps output
you'd be looking at 19 watts of heat
output for the entire v core vrm so
spread across this much air surface area
that's going to be nothing and I would
like to point out that these power
stages should get more efficient at
lower output voltages because this is uh
they're optimized for ten percent to
fifteen percent duty cycle that 1.8
volts output is on the high side of that
ten to fifteen percent so realistically
you're gonna be looking at less than
nineteen watts of heat output at stock
and four plus twenty percent power limit
you're gonna be looking less than twenty
four watts heat output because again
it's 1.8 volts 300 kilohertz switching
frequency for the whole vrm which I did
mention earlier so really really
efficient unfortunately it's hard to say
how this compares directly against some
other top-end you know say gtx 980ti
VRMs like say a hall-of-fame because for
those i actually have these sheets that
work at lower voltages and
yeah it's hard to do the comparison when
these are only rated at 1.8 volts they
should be right about in line with the
other power stages that are used on say
a gtx 10a DTI hall of fame or a gtx
980ti kingpin edition in fact this VRM
is more powerful than what you would
find on a gtx 980ti kingpin edition and
probably more powerful than what you'll
find on the hall of fame - just because
these power stages do max out at 70 amps
instead of the 88 instead of the 60 amps
that the International rectifier is 35
75 and the 35 55 used on the Hall of
Fame and the kingpin max out at so
basically NVIDIA has for the first time
built a card where I'm gonna say you
don't need to upgrade the vrm on this
you're gonna need to strap a pretty big
heat sink to the vrm maybe get a lot of
airflow so very high rpm fine if you're
gonna take this on liquid nitrogen which
I doubt anybody will do because you know
if the card is three thousand dollars
but on the off chance that you know if
you want to take one of these on liquid
nitrogen you don't you shouldn't have to
worry about the vrm and if there is a
vrm problem on this thing there's not
really an alternative unfortunately they
don't make a 32 Phase II power that I'm
aware of at least so there is not much
you know there's not much room to
upgrade the VR and this is pretty much
the peak of GPU vrm power capability
certainly I think it would be better if
it interleaved and maybe ran a higher
switching frequency after interleaving
but at least in terms of raw power
output this thing is an absolute beast
and to put a real number on that well
let's say you wanted to push 600 amps
through this monstrosity at again that
1.8 volts figure it would only produce
about 90 watts of heat which is in line
with every other top-end 1080 Ti as well
as any other top-end extreme
overclocking GPU that I've ever seen in
terms of erm heat dissipation so yeah
this thing is amazing
absolutely amazing in terms of the B
curve erm
so nothing to complain about
unfortunately except you know it could
actually get 16 phases I think here 16
phases would be justifiable compared to
like 780ti is in you can you can get
away with 10 you can get away with 12 or
16 but here I it's liking those those
doublers don't cost that much there's
footprints on the PCB already for them
why aren't they there I have no idea but
power-wise I I've got no complaints now
then let's move on to the HBM VR I'm the
HBM vrm as you can clearly see is a 1 to
phase affair the third phase took a
vacation I think along with the HBM
stack that is actually disabled on the
Titan movie as the GV 100 chip and it's
full implementation this would come with
for working HB m stacks this version
only has three so I assume that one of
the phases got taken away because well
you're not running all four stacks of HP
m you're only running three so you can
you know you can get rid of that extra
phase the power stages are exactly the
same as what you had for the vcore vrm
so again massive freaking overkill for a
assumed output of about 35 amps for the
HB m which i think might be a little bit
high
or maybe I'm overestimating the vcore
vrm output currents for 35 amps at well
again that 1.8 volts cuz the same power
stage with the equally limited power
datasheet you'd be looking at the power
consumption below 40 watts for the CRM
so in terms of at least efficiency
there's nothing to complain about is
it's a two-phase memory vrm so you know
that this is more phases than a few
reacts had for its HP m1 this is more
phases than a Vega has for its HBM I
can't complain about this again very
very impressive controlled by the same
monolithic power systems MP 2 8 8 8
voltage controller but this time
configured for only two phases I imagine
there's some versions of this card where
it has the full three phases I assume
that would be the tesla version so yeah
again just Nvidia like where did this
come from
I'm super surprised cuz I'm used to
seeing you know reference and video PCBs
and recently they've gotten a lot better
but most of the time it was a case of
like this this is kind of impressive too
especially on some dual GPU and video
cards it was actually outright
concerning like how long do you expect
this vrm to last I imagine you know no
overclocking allowed is is a policy that
actually for example a GTX 590 doesn't
support overclocking at all specifically
because the vrm on that was so shoddy
but this is just like this is up there
this is up there with the Hall of Fame
this is up there with the kingpin
edition arguably this has the better vrm
layout than basically any other extreme
overclocking card because as I said
before the you have the V curve erm
flanking either side of the GPU core
which there was some ln2 like there was
some extreme overclocking GPUs and high
phase count V RMS that we've seen on an
exam 1080 T eyes 980 T is and a few
other cards where they would actually
like put two rows of phases behind each
other which like it works out great for
your power capabilities but you end up
in a situation where you're wasting
power on on basically just getting power
from the furthest the sets of phases to
the GPU core so this thing is just like
amazing absolutely amazing I I'm not I
mean I I've never had any doubt Nvidia
could design a good vrm I never thought
they would want to but they have this is
awesome now then let's go and take a
take the chains off and lift those power
limits so the cardia has an interesting
power monitoring situation there's
actually way more shunts on this than
you would expect there's only three 12
volts inputs you have plus 12 volts on
the PCIe you have plus 12 volts on the
six pin you have plus 12 volts on the
eight pin but for some reason there's
three current monitoring shunt resistors
so you have one down here which would be
for the PCIe slot this one up here which
is probably for this expen this one down
here which is for the eight pin and you
have an i na three to two one Texa this
is a chip from Texas Instruments
Nvidia's favorite voltage
current and voltage monitoring chip for
basically monitoring power consumption
so this thing is really easy to trick
I've done it on a 1070 you can actually
do all kinds of if you feel like doing a
lot of soldiering you can basically
de-solder the monitoring circuit that
this normally runs on the actual power
inputs and you can replace it with well
you can set up a voltage divider from
plus 12 volts which you can source from
the PCIe slot or the eight pin or the
six pin you set up a voltage divider and
you can feed they're completely fake
voltages into the actual monitoring
inputs that will remove all power limits
you can also use resistors varying sizes
to reduce power readings by up to five
times and the last option which is
probably the option most people will opt
for is well most people there's not that
many people with this so it's gonna be
like what three people on earth they're
gonna do this but the last option is
that you put liquid metal across the
actual shunt resistor or you can go with
with conductive ink pens and you can
basically just draw across the shunt
resistors this lowers the electrical
resistance of the shunt and the way
shunts work is the well by a three to
one just monitors the voltage drop
across the shunt resistor and from that
voltage drop it calculates the amount of
current going into the card and also
since it's monitoring the voltages it
does current times voltage e were called
power consumption and that's how the
in-video driver knows how much power the
card is pulling and if it needs to lower
the core clock or if it can just go wild
well if you tweak the resistances on the
shunts or you know just completely fake
all the measurements for the ia three
two to one the driver will not know how
much power the card is pulling and as
long as it thinks it's pulling less
power than the maximum than the power
limit it'll allow the card to clock
higher and higher and higher and let you
push basically as much power as you can
possibly want so that's the shot mod
there's also this shunt down here but I
would recommend that you basically don't
touch that one because I can't figure
out what it's hooked up to and why it's
there if I had
the card in hand I could probably figure
out what it's for but as it is right now
I have no idea so I would just not
bother with that one for safety's sake
so yeah that that covers the PCB the
only other side note I have about this
thing is there is a loss of unoccupied
solder pads on this it almost looks like
an engineer like is it kind it just kind
of looks like an engineering sample PCB
but I guess this thing is so low
production volume or maybe it's just
since it's a professional card it might
be because they want to be able to check
for any damages better but yeah this
thing this PCB is really cramped and
there is a lot of unoccupied solder pads
which I find really odd but there's no
negative there's no real downside to
that there's also the missing a pin up
here but we've been seeing that on a lot
of a high end in video cards for a while
now so I don't find that surprising even
remotely but yeah this thing you know if
you're buying a $3,000 GPU especially
this one you can be at least certain
that for once you're getting a vrm that
it's more or less worth the $3,000
asking price on the card I still say I
would like to see doublers but you know
power capability wise this is this is
amazing but yeah I'd like to see
doublers because with more interleaving
phases you basically get better or vrm
ripple voltage ripple but going from
eight phases to 16 phases tends not to
make as much of a difference as going
from say three to eight so and video
probably calculated that past this phase
account it doesn't really make a
difference for their usual applications
and decided that we're just gonna keep
the efficiency of the 16 phase
monstrosity that we built and you know
that's that's fine but I'd still like to
see a 16 phase and that's it for this
