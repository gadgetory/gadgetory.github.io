more and how expensive they are just
think to yourself how hard it is for the
memory suppliers one of them recently
told me off the record we're making more
money than ever
so I mean based on that statement alone
it's really hard for them right now and
looking at a stock chart for example for
one of the major memory suppliers would
definitely not make it look like they're
making boatloads of money despite the
shortage as they claim so we're gonna be
talking about Mary prices a little bit
today we have another content piece that
will talk about them in a lot more
detail this is all independent GN
research orgy on exclusive information
we've retrieved and you'll want to
subscribe and make sure you catch that
follow-up content otherwise we're
talking about some am the information
clean and some am the information we
received as well and and then we've got
some discussion about case design once
again before that this video is brought
to you by thermal grizzly makers of the
conductor not liquid metal that we
recently used to drop 20 degrees off of
our temperatures thermal grizzly also
makes traditional thermal compounds we
use on top of the IHS like cryo not and
hydro not pastes learn more at the link
below so first a quick update on the mod
mats is this is actually good a good
weapon this ice mod mats tough this is
really cool so we're learning more and
more about manufacturing as we go the
newest thing we've learned is that we
can make some tooling now so we're
starting to do enough volume with a
factory where we can basically make some
custom tooling for the cut so cutting
the mat now will be semi-automated
rather than 100% by hand and that means
a lot of things for us one of them
presently I am hand sorting a lot of the
mats when we get them in so for quality
control purposes I'm actually still
looking at forty to sixty percent of the
mats personally roll them out look at
them make sure everything looks perfect
and then we roll it back up ship it out
and I autograph a bunch of those in the
process for people who buy the signed
ones but the point is that now when
doing quality control we know that all
of the mats are going through the same
tooling and this is kind of the same
thing that I'll say big mat or real
manufacturers do when they do things
like case tooling or whatever
because as you invest more and more into
your tooling you can reduce production
time and it hopefully increased quality
definitely in our case increased quality
we're also doing some custom stuff for
the print so the print should be more
automated now and super accurate we're
investing in that tooling for the for
the matte cut and for the printing
process so it's more investment on our
front but it definitely will pay off and
it means we have a higher quality
product which is already super high
quality so really happy about all this
it's as I said previously this is a huge
learning experience for us because
product manufacturing is giving me
personally a very new angle for when I
look at products review because I
understand the things that manufacturers
go through I understand the tooling cost
and the trade-offs they make where
you're basically committing to making
these things for a long time because
you've just spent money on tooling and
stuff like that also all the mats for
the previous run should have shipped out
by now if they have shipped out by now
if you're in the u.s. you most likely
have yours if you're not give it a bit
more time its shipping international
otherwise email support at gamers Nexus
net if you have any questions about an
existing order or if you'd like to place
an order and you just have some
questions about the mat and how it works
or whatever and we'll help you out we're
very focused on support i've hired
someone to specifically help with
support so it's just support at gamers
nexus Donette if you have any questions
send them there he'll help you out and
we are very seriously making sure that
our support process is good because i
know one of the things that pisses me
off with companies whose products we
review is support so i don't want to
fall into that trap and we're taking it
seriously if you like what you see and
you want one of the GN anti-static mod
mats make sure you back order now
because we keep selling through them
every time or come in go to store dock
gamers nexus net if you back order now
we'll definitely get you in for the next
production run but that should remain
true for a bit longer because this week
we are in finalizing cutting next week
we're doing printing and then we'll
start shipping process within the next
five weeks or so but yeah let's move on
to the first real news item AMD news so
first one this is really quick in
addition to the ddr5 and near memory
that I talked about a couple weeks ago
in a news video we also have information
that AMD is trying to ship video cards
with nine gigabit per second memory
parts later this year so I can't
directly confirm it my source is very
credible so I would believe it at this
point I'm not positive what that would
be I don't know if maybe they're
supposed to eventually make a smaller
Vega discrete GPU so I don't know if
they'd use it for that or they're
sticking with hpm because they're
ramping up their HP on production as
well
either way though keep an eye out for 9
gigabit per second day in the parks
heard it here first I guess that'd be
the memory they're using there's not
much 9 gigabit per second gddr5 most of
its 8 gigabits per second some of its 7
and NVIDIA I think is presently the only
GPU maker that has some devices with
nine gigabit per second memory unless
you go up to HBM to which AMD's and of
course on Vega we also currently are
theorizing that AMD has higher core
count rise and CB as planned so this
came about and build Zoids video where
builds are speculated that the sheer
power of the vrm is he's been looking at
lately for X 470 might be compensation
for a future rise in part and we kind of
continued that when we did the VR I'm
heatsink benchmark if you haven't seen
it go to the channel it's a gigabyte X
470 game in 7 we tested it with the
heatsink on versus off and because it's
got 40 amp power stages and 10 of them
for 10-plus to phase it has absolutely
no issues with thermals whatsoever which
we kind of think might suggest that
board vendors are preparing for higher
core count CPU components in the future
whether or not board vendors actually
know that those are coming or they're
just preparing for the possibility I'm
not sure but that's a kind of our
current in-house speculation on why the
boards are relatively overkill for what
they're powering with the rise in 2000
series and he also posted a big blog
post about their Radeon branding so
they're planning to do radeon exclusive
brands in the future this is kind of
taking the GPP news and stride and
they're basically trying to take a
situation that they have been pretty
vocal about indirectly or directly
and create something good out of it by
getting their own and the exclusive
branding for graphics cards as well one
of their statements in the content was
pretty on the nose it said quote or they
were offering quote the freedom to tell
others in the industry that they won't
be boxed into choosing proprietary
solutions that come bundled with quote
gamer taxes just to enjoy great
experiences they should rightfully have
access to so very on-the-nose AMD's
clearly taking a jab at nvidia i would
like to point out that if you're gonna
say gamer taxes maybe don't do the whole
vega thing and yet free games for Vega
that you're marketing to gamers and
trying to cut minors out of it for an
extra hundred dollars it's not free
games hundred dollars I know they pretty
much killed that program but if you're
gonna talk trash at least don't be
guilty of the same thing yourself
I do understand really coming from the
Andes trying to make light of a
situation that they've been concerned
about lately with GT PP so basically all
you need to know is keep an eye out for
new graphics card brand names coming out
for future revisions whatever those may
be Vega or something else but the board
vendors are working with AMD to produce
those so keep an eye out for new
branding now on memory suppliers making
more money than ever this is where this
story is pretty interesting and we're
gonna dive into this more in a
standalone video but a couple of basics
for you if you're not familiar with how
much money components cost we previously
had some pretty good information on
memory prices for gddr5 HP m2hb em stuff
like that we didn't have g5 eggs and
that information was published in a
content piece where we talked about how
much does it cost to make Vega the
graphics card entirely so we go over the
RM cost
HBM memory the actual memory high
bandwidth memory the GPU itself stuff
like that and gave you some numbers
there things have changed a lot since
then because the memory markets been so
crazy and we also have some new numbers
as well so one thing the fabs that are
producing the wafers $15,000,000,000
fabs for the superfab they're called
were they're multi-story and they dice
wafers and produce all of the memory
chips that come out and eventually get
sold to the manufacturers each wafer
right now from our
highly credible source produces
something around eight thousand dollars
of profit per wafer they can do
something like fifteen hundred memory
chips on average per wafer and give you
an idea let's say it's all just gddr5 it
there are a lot of different chips that
these SK Hynix micron Samsung a lot of
different types of chips they can put on
a wafer so the price will vary per wafer
but let's just look at memory alone for
gddr5 gddr5 easily sells for nine
dollars per chip right now for eight
gigabit modules 1 gigabyte module so if
you buy eight of them for your 8
gigabyte graphics card you've already
got a lot of cost in just memory and
that's gone up a lot so we already know
that memory prices have gone up twenty
to thirty dollars for graphics cards
it's eight gigabytes of gddr5 this year
and nine dollars is the nine dollars
easily for an eight gigabit price is
what we were given and then if you go to
say HP m you're spending multiples of
nine dollars Oh am i Cal HP folks like
that they could spend up to ten eleven
dollars per module because they're the
graphics card vendors at least get
better prices from what we've been told
so that's an op shop but either way the
vendors the suppliers here hynek's
micron Samsung are making buckets of
money right now and they claim they're
out of cleanroom space they claim that
they have shortages because of the high
demand for other devices like cell
phones
there's absolutely truth to a lot of
that but we also kind of question
exactly how true stuff it is because
memory companies have a history of
dragging out these shortages as long as
they can some of that has been proven
legally and profiting off of it if you
look at their stock charts again it
pretty much shows what's going on now
another thing here if you're trying to I
mentioned to this particular individual
who works at one of the major suppliers
that the current rumors in the industry
for the past couple months have been
pointing at originally 2018 for reduced
Maori prices and the individual
literally laughed at
and what I said and said that's not
going to happen for system memory
specifically and part of this is because
margins on things like server memory are
really high they can be 60% margins on
server memory Enterprise memories so why
would you target desktop consumers when
you can make that kind of money selling
the servers that's where your desktop
memory prices and alleged shortage come
from just some interesting stuff for you
all to think about will have a separate
thing on that later
next up Intel document suggests eight
core coffee-like skews reddit users have
discovered technical documents on
intel's website alluding to coffee like
s parts with 8 cores 8 core coffee like
parts have been rumored for a while now
presume to launch alongside the equally
rumored and definitely does exist as e
390 chipset it's still unclear what
format this chip would take and the
Intel documents paint more of a broad
stroke
however a skew that could slot in just
above the 8700 K could give Intel an 8
core mainstream option to dull the edge
of AMD's recent rise in to launch
particularly our 720 720 700 X next one
an tech launches the new DF 500 case
alright let's take a look at it put it
up on the screen ok moving on
next one Google Fiber finally working
well I just wanted to plug this quickly
we ranted about Google Fiber and how
awful their service was in our early
months sign up with them and it's
finally functioning properly so we kind
of got it working a couple months ago
when I first posted the rant about it
and that's because they saw it and they
immediately responded by sending someone
out to fix the Google Fiber
implementation so we got it all unsolved
but over the last couple of months we
were having some issues with upload
times I don't know if it was packet loss
or what the deal was but every now and
then we go from a 4k maybe 8 gigabyte
video taking 2 to 5 minutes to upload to
just randomly taking 2 and a half hours
which it would have been faster to
upload on previous internet from another
provider at that rate so never figured
out what the cause of that was but I
didn't want to post to follow up and say
hey it's working great now until that
was fixed I didn't
the Google Fiber people didn't really
want to deal with the hassle just kind
of waited to see if it got fixed it has
been and now we can upload large videos
upwards of 8 to 12 gigabytes sometimes
in minute literal minutes like I drag it
over and sit there and watch it for 30
seconds and it's 50% done so it's pretty
cool really happy to see that glad that
it's working properly now hopefully
Google can kind of stay on top of it
their service is supposed to be
exceptional we didn't have that
experience originally but they sent out
a I guess city manager for Google Fiber
and made sure it got done properly when
they came out the second time and I was
very happy with that level of service so
hopefully everyone can get that without
having to complain publicly about it but
if you're thinking about Google Fiber we
do like it a lot now that it's
functional it was just a matter of
getting it here superfast it's been
consistent and upload time requirement
regardless of what time we upload we get
the fold down and up pretty much
simultaneously so we can pull steam
games down as fast as the steam will
allow us like I think I've seen up to 80
megabytes per second and still push a
video up the pipe as well and get that
up within minutes so yep
thank you Google Fiber for fixing it
hopefully anyone else if you have issues
hopefully they will resolve it for you I
found Tweety not them work the best
next one hardware news cryo rig launches
finally their full copper c7 first shown
at Computex 2017 cryo rig is releasing
their c7 see you a full copper variance
of the original c7 in that small
form-factor pcs by using copper in lieu
of aluminum cry raked out a 15% increase
in thermal performance moreover using
copper allowed cryo rig to increase
thermal efficiency without adding size
to the heatsink or increasing fan speed
not exactly a hundred percent positive
what they mean by a 15% increase in
thermal performance it's kind of a weird
way to measure thermal performance
especially percentages if you're dealing
with anything but Kelvin but either way
typically in our testing in the ancient
past copper versus aluminum doesn't
normally have a huge impact but
in something like a small form-factor PC
where you might be dealing with a really
high ambient temperature that's where it
starts to matter because the the
difference is in a large K is copper
versus aluminum with decent air flow
conditions you're pretty much at the
same level of performance if at all
other factors are the same but with a
small form-factor case the heat density
is a lot higher in a really concentrated
area and we found that it can be
beneficial there we don't have any plans
to review them presently though May or
early June for release targeted at $50
for the prior week for copper c7 next up
EK will begin offering pre-built pcs
under the new EK fluid gaming pc line EK
is angle is that not everyone has time
to build their own pc however that pitch
seems to be every boutique pc builders
approach so not really that unique more
realistically EK is attempting to carve
out a niche audience in buyers that are
apprehensive about selecting compatible
liquid cooling parts and risking
potential leaks EK says they're offering
systems with Rhydon 2000 series CPUs on
video GPUs and then in-house EK
solutions for cooling with an in-house
version of the in win at 101 c chassis
using custom paint configurable options
include PS use from EVGA ram from
g.skill cal mod pro sleeves cable kits
and the base MSI motherboards and
storage options from Samsung at Seagate
$2,100 starting price for those for the
lowest and configuration out of ek and
finally couple of hardware sales we
spotted we're gonna try and start
putting these at the end of the news
videos again like we did during the big
sales at the end of the year we noticed
and L do this mostly applies to the US
but go double check it I guess
LG at 32 ud5 9b 32 inch 4k LED display
we actually I think have this exact one
with Andy free sync for currently $445
which is a decent drop in price and then
the EVGA is 450 watt BT PSU non-modular
and it's 80 plus bronze nothing fancy at
all about it it's just dirt cheap it's
twenty-five dollars right now so this is
a power supply I wouldn't necessarily I
absolutely would not recommend it for
anything remotely high-end or mid-range
but if you're kind of going the cheap
bastard approach of
not spending any money unless we're you
absolutely have to it's an okay power
supply for something like an APU build
or a low-end D GPU and CPU build so
something worth considering if you're
really scraping the bottom of the barrel
for budget because it's one of the
better power supplies in terms of things
that are $24 or whatever it is and
