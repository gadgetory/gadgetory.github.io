hardware news recap this week's been
pretty busy TSMC is-7 anna meter process
leading for fourth quarter 2018 revenue
in towns making moves for seven animated
production including in the u.s.
actually one of their old fabrication
plants 1660 TI continued news rumors
announcements back blazes report and
also this thing we're gonna be talking
about today before that this video is
brought to you by the coarser 1i 140
compact gaming pc the Corsair 1i 140 is
a small form-factor pc outfitted with a
9700 k RT x 28 e 32 gigabytes of RAM and
a 480 gigabyte nvme SSD all housed
within a 2 millimeter thick aluminum
chassis the Corsair 1i 140 is a 12 liter
system fit for desktop use with the same
size the I 160 counterpart with
higher-end parts
learn more at the link in the
description below so first up the ln2
this is a giant liquid nitrogen
container we just got it in we have a
special guest Pro overclocker coming in
and the stream will be on Sunday so
that's the 27th is that right think
think it's the 27th Sunday and that'll
be at 1 p.m. Eastern time so we'll put
some other times on the screen or
something just to help you out but 1:00
p.m. Eastern Time in the US and we'll be
there will be a special guest here when
me using liquid nitrogen from me
overclocking 299 ATX e and that's
primarily what's going to get the Ellen
2 so this is a dare bauer beast pot that
I have here Alan to pot and then we I
don't know what we're gonna do with the
video cards we might just do water to
make it easy but we do have the
capability to do Alan to you out there
as well it just depends on how
complicated we want to make things so
definitely check back it's gonna be our
most fun stream yet and having a special
guest is also going to make it a lot
more fun because it's someone who like I
said pro overclockers so a lot of
experience and should make things pretty
interesting for everyone so absolutely
check back on Sunday that'll be one day
from the day this video is posted at
1:00 p.m. Eastern time us and and you
can check out the stream on our YouTube
channel
first news item here it's a tsmc is 7
nanometer process takes the lead for
fourth quarter 2018 revenue and in 2018
TSMC expected the post
revenue growth for fourth quarter thanks
to their advantage presently in seven
nanometer manufacturing being basically
the only ones doing it so TSM C
announced that it expects over 100
different 7 nanometer designs to be
taped out by 2019 and it also seems that
its predictions so far have been
accurate because as TSM see technology
has been the biggest driver of revenue
in the first in the final quarter of
2018 tsmc is also looking towards a
strong first quarter of 2019 7 animator
accounted for 23% of TSM C's total
revenue in fourth quarter 2018 while it
made up about 10% of their annual 2018
revenue pretty impressive considering
the company wasn't doing seven and read
the entire year and further this oh and
if you didn't know it was ramped in
about June so that's pretty good a
pretty good revenue share considering
that it's only been a couple of months
six months or so the SMC has looked at
lucrative partnerships with AMD apple
and Vidya and Qualcomm who will all lean
on TSM C's competitive advantage with
seven nanometer TSMC is expected to roll
out its second generation 7 nanometer
technology sometime in 2019 which will
include the use of UV or extreme
ultraviolet lithography something that
we've talked out on the channel in the
past with expert technical analyst David
Cantor if you missed that video you
should check it out we talked 10
nanometer versus 7 and we talked about
UV as well it's an important technology
Intel setting the stage for seven
animated production on its side of the
fence so this has been a long time
coming according to a report by The
Oregonian the Intel is preparing to
expand its Oregon d1x facility to
accommodate future 7 animated production
the report cites quote unnamed sources
my voice is reverberating off of the
lm-2 container sites unnamed sources so
take this with a grain of salt of course
it also cites quote people familiar with
conversations whatever that means ever
heard it in a coffee shop or something
saying that Intel could begin a
construction as early as June 4 it's 7
nanometer updates now despite sort of
the the sarcasm there this does actually
look like it's going to be a thing
because
intel's own public and official
timelines do align with this so this is
something intel has itself talked about
in the past so what's going on then
basically there's a project that looks
to add a third phase to d 1x the oregon
facility and it looks like that'll be
equipped for EU v7 and reproduction
speaking of TSMC it's in dolls going the
same direction construction would last
18 months followed by several months of
up fits for equipment installation so
this is not a quick process and this is
all according to the oregon ian
Oregonian oregon ian i don't know their
sources them so last december dr. anne
Kelleher senior vice president and GM of
manufacturing and operations at Intel
announced that Intel had plans for
multi-year expansions at its Oregon
plant and included as well Israel and
Ireland for its expansion options so the
Oregon Ian or whatever their report
seems to align with Intel's plans and
despite this being sort of peppered with
phrases like familiar with conversations
it does appear to be a real thing this
one's sort of interesting and caught us
a bit off guard so there's a lawsuit
dating back to 2015 that had just been
granted class action certification and
has been allowed to proceed and this has
date set for February 5th 2019 to
establish a timeline the lawsuit will
see AMD and plaintiffs take a case
regarding what the definition of a CPU
core is before a jury in California this
is assuming that AMD doesn't decide to
settle out of court as companies often
do but the company has already committed
to defending itself vigorously in quotes
the plaintiffs alleged that they were
misled by Andy's representation of their
FX processors whereby am the marketed
the chips as eight core desktop CPUs the
crux of the issue is in the way am the
defines a CPU core with FX series each
x86 core resides on a module with
another x86 core and resources like l2
cache floating-point unit and
instruction fetch and decode circuitry
all shared between the cores
the plaintiffs claim this messaging is
disingenuous and that the FX series
isn't not native in it as an eight-core
part
and only has four functional course the
plaintiffs seek compensation for the
difference between an eight-core and a
four core cpu the skews in question are
the FX 80 120 80 150 8320 8250 80 to 70
93 seventy and ninety five ninety and
the complaint states the following
according to plaintiffs a quote core is
a processing unit that is able to
operate eg perform calculations and
execute instructions independent from
other cores positioned on a chip
plaintiffs allege that the bulldozer
CPUs advertised as having eight cores
actually contain eight sub processors
which share resources such as l2 memory
caches and floating-point units as for
what's going to happen with that case
while it's it's sort of just getting
started so we'll keep you posted this
one's a rumor but well it's seems like
it's probably going to be a thing
probably going to be accurate sixteen
sixty TI arriving in February for $280
for the sixteen sixty to follow and
apparently a sixteen fifty and the work
so we haven't we've we've confirmed bits
and pieces of this but not all of it
we've already confirmed two sixteen
sixty Ti is going to exist we haven't
confirmed or checks with anyone on a
timeline or a price so that's hard OCPs
reporting and this report by hard OCP
citing sources close to the product is
attaching launch dates to Nvidia's long
rumored non RT x touring based cards and
also is looking at pricing so they're
saying february 15th for $280 and a gtx
1660 non TI hard OCP reports will
allegedly arrive in early March for $230
if the reporting is accurate wildly low
and the GTX 1650 will come in late March
for $180 based upon this report so this
is this is what we know so far it's
unofficial information of course and
it's well some of it the 1660 Ti bid is
probably accurate you could surmise
interestingly harder CP claims and video
will continue to supply the 1050 Ti
presumably in lieu of a 1650 t I take
all this with a grain of salt of course
though as we've speculated fleshing out
a selection of torreón options sans RT x
makes a whole lot of sense as developers
and consumers have largely been slow to
acclimate to ray tracing and real time
anyway developers are slow to support it
and consumers have been on
prepared to pay for it I'm out a few
more trivial Hardware announcements but
ones which are cemented in press
releases so their official Samsung has
announced its new 970 Evo plus family of
SSDs trailing Western Digital so recent
black SN 750 launch that's been in the
news lately
so the 970 Evo plus will supersede the
970 Evo as Sam sons sort of high-end
consumer nvme SSD while also being
Samsung's first mainstream offering
using 96 layer 3d net the United 70 Evo
plus like its predecessor uses the m2 20
to 80 form factor and a pcie 3.0 by 4
connection the drive will be offered in
capacities of 250 gigabytes 500
gigabytes and one terabyte as well as 2
terabytes as usual speeds will vary a
bit based on capacity specifically
sequential write speeds nonetheless the
drives are rated for sequential read and
write speeds up to 3500 megabytes per
second and 3300 back writes per second
respectively the construction of the 970
Evo plus hasn't changed significantly
based on the paper specifications the
new drives will still use the Samsung
Fenix controller and lpddr4 dram which
makes the key focus of these drives at
Samsung's at fifth-generation 3d net
Samsung's at newest generation of NAND
should allow them to remain competitive
in pricing while also increasing density
improving cost per gigabyte and
performance per watt in theory anyway
MSRP is for the 970 Evo plus are going
to be $90 for the 250 gigabyte model
$130 for the 500 gigabyte model 250 for
one terabyte and TBD for two terabytes
Samsung offers a five-year warranty with
all of its 970 Evo plus models with the
tbw or total bytes written data
available in samsung specs on their
website so noticeably absent is any
mention of a 970 Pro Plus model and
Samsung could be waiting for the arrival
of PCIe 4.0 or even 5.0 since that has
been firmly ratified at this point
finally Backblaze the backup company has
released its annual hard drive report so
the report for 2018 if you don't know
Backblaze puts these out every year and
often quarterly to their reports on
thousands upon thousands of hard drives
and the reliability of those
I was in a real data center and backup
storage solution enterprise so you can
see sort of how many of their drives
have failed in different categories and
it's always interesting it's it's of
course one source for information but
they have thousands of Drive so it's
pretty good source so Backblaze is 2018
report mostly is unsurprising if you've
seen their previous ones these kinds of
reports do tend to highlight broad
trends and data storage as well so the
trends according to Backblaze stats are
that there is continued migration
towards denser storage and the
annualized failure rate has lowered of
course it could thin the information
comes from a monitoring process of a
hundred and four thousand seven hundred
and seventy eight hard drives this time
across 15 different models for 2018 back
plays continued to replace two three and
four terabyte hard drives with eight ten
and twelve terabyte options they even
had some 14 terabyte options added to
the mix and those are the helium-filled
PMR drives from Toshiba
a couple of highlights from the report
are as follows in 2016 the average size
of hard drives in use was 4.5 terabytes
by 2018 the average size had grown to
7.7 terabytes the 2018 annualized
failure rate of 1.25% was the lowest by
far of any year that Backblaze has
recorded so interesting information on
hard drives and as always we'll have all
these links in the show notes below if
you want to check the sources for these
stories and then that brings us back to
the conclusion here check back for our
overclocking livestream Sunday that's
tomorrow at the time this video goes
live so that'll be Sunday at 1:00 p.m.
Eastern Time in the u.s. check back
we'll be doing some liquid-nitrogen
overclock and I'll be the first time
we've ever live-streamed it so hopefully
hopefully the tank hasn't leaked
otherwise we won't be able to do it but
