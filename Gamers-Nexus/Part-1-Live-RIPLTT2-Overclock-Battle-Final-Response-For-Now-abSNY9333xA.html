is it going I think it's going let me
know if someone says image needs more
ray-tracing can't do that for you sorry
what we're gonna be doing today is
testing the cards versus Linus's score
that he posted to the wrong thing so let
me know if you can hear me first of all
can you can you hear let me know if you
can hear stuff looks like people say yes
and then we'll get going pretty shortly
here I'm just sending out a tweet to let
everyone know that we're going people
are saying it's working
show us the rig yes we will do that
momentarily we are alive okay I'm just
tweeting that out so here's what
happened that's a lot of a lot of chat
messages here's what happened
Linus or Linus's team I should say
tweeted tweeted out that they I don't
know what they say Mike Mike dot dot dot
dot dot dot drop so they tweeted out
they said Mike drop and they posted a
screenshot of a score that was ahead of
both mine and Jays but I looked at it
and uh it was a single card benchmarks
so I don't know if they didn't get the
memo or what but my single card score
was from like six months ago when I
challenged them so a bit of a latent
response but we're happy they responded
don't get me wrong
thank you lionesses team and/or lioness
for jumping in responding they actually
posted their video on floatplane and if
you have it I think it is called I don't
have it open anymore I think it's called
we beat the wrong OC record or something
like beat throne world record so there
they're fully aware of it but if you
want to check it out I guess I'll be
coming to their main channel soon and
before it comes to their main channel
though we're gonna beat their new high
score for single card which I wasn't
competing and cuz I didn't know it was
the thing so we're gonna beat that today
and then we're going to go back to dual
card Destin with our ice bucket and
that's that's when we'll be going
through the final tests
here until I can tear it down and get
back to normal reviews and stuff like
that so okay and what's what's going on
in chat I'm waiting for everything to
fill up for a bit and then we'll get
going so just checking seeing what chat
says what CPU is this not going to tell
you if you'll you'll have to figure it
out yourself okay I we want blood that
that might be a little extreme ah I
don't know how a blood cooling loop
would do though but I'd be willing to
try it if it's better
all right so couple things in chat here
did you see there Bauer's score yes of
course I actually I spoke with Roman
with their Bauer
I was up till 7 a.m. that night he was
up in Taiwan until well I guess it was
7:00 p.m. his time and so he told me
that he was about to post a score he
showed me the score as it was at the
time only about a hundred or 200 points
higher than ours which was still pretty
much on a table for us and then he
wasn't posted that 16,000 score so I
mean the race is done like that's it
there's no catching up but Linus is now
first on the single card benchmarks and
by first I mean first of the three
youtubers that are involved in his
competition he's not anywhere close to
actual verse that's kingpin who is
really more like a zero because it's
he's always there so just a constant at
this point so we can't have Linus be
ahead of us in any scores let alone
single card and I didn't know you know
like I said I know it was a competition
so I guess we'll make it a competition
now and I bring to you again the ice
bucket the the our version of the ice
bucket challenge as it were and so let
us enjoy your place on the top while you
can I guess because our plan is to post
a higher number during this stream and
hopefully pretty soon we'll see though
so alright here's what we got
I'm just watching this Henry language
out for a different one at some point
the stream if I remember but if you
haven't seen it quick recap we have
everything I don't even know where to
start we have everything going into an
ice bucket and I'll just walk you
through this before we turn it all on
and it gets loud so ice buckets over
here we'll start the benchmarking
momentarily
and I'll check chat in a moment - I'm
away from the screen right now this is
actually really cold we need to put more
ice in here we'll be doing that time -
before as the stream gets going so
you're gonna have to deal with that
noise for a second but we need to put
more ice in we have now - five sixty so
we replaced the 360 thermaltake radiator
that wasn't here for the CPU with a five
sixty EK radiator that's a bit fatter
and the point of that was really just so
that we could get I mean get them
completely flat I extended the tubes
works Patrick on that so we putting QD
sees and extended the tube length that
way we could get the CPU cooler properly
submerged because it was not before it
was sticking halfway out of the ice and
that was increasing our temperatures a
bit so that's the ice bucket that needs
to be filled up again then we have an EK
pump for pump and res combo for the cpu
we have a res and a dual pump down there
for the GPU we have two GPUs on the loop
using supremacy blocks we have a
supremacy block on the CPU we borrowed
one of these from our patreon backer
Ritchie c77 thank you very much Ritchie
Ritchie by the way as I think number
three on the single card score so we'll
be heading up his direction today with
our benchmarks so really cool to have
members of XOC community in our in our
patreon group like that so that's my
type g.skill try and see blacks in here
I got new memory today quick testing I
couldn't get it to post as good timings
as this kit so we're gonna stick with
that kit that's a 3600 kit that I
overclocked four thousand my grades will
go over all the setting strands stream
and then a couple fans all over the
board so that coming to meet this that
covers the system as it is right now and
let me see-oh is J J's texted me hang on
okay all right J I got your message if
you're if you're watching I got it I
think we're about to see J upload a new
score and let's open up the 3d mark Hall
of Fame we can look at that so let me
let's let's check let's check what the
Hall of Fame is if he's uploaded it yet
how is J texting you from beyond the
grave okay so yeah rip is not actually
literally ripping people so I'm just
opening up three three mark Hall of Fame
and we're gonna see where J stands right
now and we're line of stands then beat
them both by the way so I was talking
with all things down seriously stop stop
stop killing the website I need it um I
had a message that one be like hey guys
can you uh like get better servers for
me or something cuz all right so before
we get started let me show off some of
our some of our casualties Jay had a
casualty and some of his set apart well
I don't know Jay did you recover it
finally if you're in chat I know for a
little while he thought he had CPU
degradation and then I think ended up
correcting it or found out it was like a
windows bug or something and maybe the
CV is actually fine after all I'm not
sure but we did have a casualty
couple days ago and it was a gentle
typhoon fan so where that knock so one
is on the bench right now that's just
screwed into the bench i sat this one
and uh it was stable like I didn't need
to screw it in or anything it was stable
like that but eventually one of the
wires moved or a tube like drooped and
moved the wire and so what happened is a
collision this yes the FSF spurt extra
hollow fame parently but also f4 the
gentle typhoon fan I bought more of
these because I like these fans so much
but and I couldn't be with that one but
uh this blade collided directly with one
of our corsair maglev fans the ml 140 we
had that's a lot of heft and so the
Macklin fan one I guess let's of course
there is engineering on the on the MLC
fan I know their thermal engineer who
worked on designing it has always been
very proud when he's told me about how
strong the blades are on it and I've
always just been kind of like yeah but
who cares like dude who cares how strong
the blades are well apparently there are
occasionally reasons that you care how
strong the blades are so yes sad sadly
we lost that fan but we bought some more
for it so respects paid for that fan
thank you very much chat okay so I'm
waiting well I won't wait too long but
I'm
trying to get the Hall of Fame's a load
and if it won't load I'll just go to
I'll just go to Twitter and we'll check
minuses tweet there let me see if J sent
anything else I think I don't know J if
you're watching I can't get Hall of Fame
to load feel free to just text me the
numbers you got and I'll read them on
the on the stream alright so let me open
up the tweet that Linus's team sent out
so we at least have some perspective as
to why we're gonna respond to them first
and then we'll go into the benchmarking
and actually do it so let's see where is
your tweet Linus so they have something
on flow plane and they sent out a teaser
other T's are first we don't have a
direct feed of this so you're just going
to look at the screen but let me let me
get this situated so you can see what
what they're up to
okay you ready Andrew for a screen a
non-literal screenshot okay so can you
see that okay as I clear they posted
this I'm not gonna adjust the brightness
or anything we'll just look at this
briefly if you can't see it it's on flow
plan it's like an ice bucket or it's a
cooler anyway I don't know what they
have in it they have some fat radiator
they hooked up maybe to an AC unit or an
old chiller I don't know what's going on
but either way that was one of the
things they posted and then they also
did where is it where did they say mic
drop how long ago is this though there
it is okay here you go here's here's
where Linus tech tips tried to throw
some shade uh-huh and then tripped on
the shade they threw so drops dot
thought thought thought thought thought
thought mic and why are they dropping
the mic because they took seventh in a
benchmark no one is competing in so I
responded today Linus got 8360 so full
credit to them that's pretty good score
J's up there with 82 21 that's before J
or I were we're really trying with the
with anything really with ice box or any
of that stuff so that was when we were
first just playing around acting mine
was Titan V and J says so by the way we
can't get he can't get times before the
Hall of Fame to load either Jays score
is fifteen thousand to thirty four which
is really good
our score on the Hall of Fame right now
is 15,000 242 so a serious serious
competition there and I've really
enjoyed keeping it kind of like you know
as we got more into this I was thinking
about how is there a way we can keep
this going without getting 2l on two
levels because at that point it's just
like the time sink is massive and both
of us would need to work with companies
to bring an Ellen to or at least I would
anyway he might have a hookup already
and and so we're pushing as far as we
can without going that route for now and
who knows maybe will collaborate with at
the EVGA HQ or something later down the
line okay so that's the scores we need
to beat Linus first our poll is up again
in a bit and superglue the blade to the
fan it's it's really not that important
Thank You Deborah scores 16,000 248 for
anyone who's wondering we're not gonna
be beating that today but let's start
with with the ripping - score and we
need to put ice in the bucket trouble
super chats first bill Wan Chai low 69
69 sadly can't watch the stream just
dropping by good luck with the OCS thank
you Bill
five but that's also that's a very
generous donation thank you Adam
Shuman senior $5 make them dunsky yes if
you if you didn't see the last stream we
were talking about kingpin jumped into
chat which was awesome and came Ben I
thought up how when he was overclocking
with robic locker at copy tax every time
it would blue screen he thought it was
dead from condensation which is why we
have all the rap tubes here and he'd say
she's done ski Steve she's done ski and
revive it again
Zachary Applegate to box let's get him
thank you very much we'll do that moment
you mister of MX 20 blood Steve blood
bit extreme zdg good to see a zdg thanks
for dropping in he's one of our patreon
backers we the patreon group built him a
computer now on we go C to G 10 bucks
sacrifices to the OC gods must be in
blood or coffee really you guys you guys
have a bit of a thing for blood and it's
kind of weird bill Wan Chai two bikes
press f for dead boy Idol values five
dollars is you're not big enough now
referencing the
that I was attaching to his screw which
was the wrong size in the last video
Howard grade 12 bucks cycle OC was here
all right that's what I'll stop there
for now so we got a good chat gone here
let's fill the fill the bucket I guess
and I'll chop this out quick as well if
you're watching the stream and I can't
guarantee it but if you buy something
from the GN store on store docking
razaaq's it's not not during the stream
I will try to shout it out so I'm gonna
keep an eye on store orders and depend
on how many there are how busy I am with
the OC machine I'll try and shout out
your first name and where you're from if
you buy anything on store I can't resist
on that so okay I need an ice bag and
then we're gonna fill that bucket up
mm-hmm so I'm just I'm walking off shot
to the freezer and this might be loud
momentarily when we dump it in the ice
bucket but it's gonna be part of what
we're doing today so there's there's our
first sacrifice to the OC bucket and I
don't really want to go outside and drop
this on the concrete during the stream
so we'll just kind of I think this is
how hammers are supposed to be used and
just break up the ice so it falls in
more gracefully okay okay hopefully it
doesn't just rip open on the carpet
and we're also for watching for splash
onto the bench so I'm going to apologize
in advance for the noise of dumping ice
and try and keep it quiet for you nice
splash super good no splash on the bench
okay there's the first bag as the bench
on wet yes it appears fine alright one
more bag of ice then we have some more
if we need them later huh and we have a
drain in that bucket which has become
very useful so all I'm doing right now
is filling this thing with ice putting
20 pounds on there to start and this
will start our OC vs. lioness let me
check what the chat saying right now
what's chat saying alright using salt in
the water - no not right now no we're
not don't want stuff arrived yet no
Roman aka their Bower did send something
and I don't think he's revealed what it
is so I won't either we if it got here
it got here today and I haven't seen it
yet
but I don't think it did and we'll be
looking at that probably after doing
some of our normal reviews because we
are pretty behind on reviews from this
so this is gonna be the last time for
now that's still very frozen last time
for now that you're gonna see this this
beast of a machine before we have to go
back to normal content production I'm
sure there's a mix of people some people
probably happy about that if you're
bored with this and some people probably
looking forward to more but we'll try
and appeal to everyone as we continue
make content all right a big shot here
that would put a hole on the radio put
that one down carefully this is the last
bag gonna empty before we start going
with it overclock so we really need more
water volume in here right now
but clearly this will turn into water so
you should be fine
the biggest problem is when the water
that gets hot doesn't move around the
radiators and then then obviously it'll
get warmer but I have a pond pump in
there that should help a little bit of
water in there and I think we can
probably start going so let me turn this
bench on and kick things off hopefully
no water splashed on there okay
bench needs to be on is it plugged in
over there yellow power strips on yes
no no okay I thought your lights are
plugged in there okay we're turning the
bench on that is really cold water the
hand is freezing okay
yes the the pumps are all on they're all
connected to the same power supply we're
just using one PSU 1600 watt ax 60 is
1600 I I actually I should check the
power draw during the stream maybe I'm
not sure what we're drawing but it's a
lot so you should disable spectrum
meltdown patches yes I know we've we've
disabled quite a few things those
actually aren't two of them though I
didn't disable those explicitly so that
is but we're not gonna do that today
it's fine did using a 6-pin auxilary
powers from mac true 4421 did using six
pin auxilary power on the motherboard
add an eighth stability improvements the
PCIe power I saw Jay was using it we are
- I don't know I mean I've talked to
builds read about that in the past and I
think his conclusion is that the extra 6
pin PCI II doesn't really do a whole lot
at least unless I don't know it's really
a problem where you're adding that pin
because you don't want to pull all your
power in this case 150 watts max through
the 24 pin connector so if you have like
four cards it's probably useful but it
depends how much power those are sucking
down through the PCIe slot this is
really only adding there I don't know
like it might we're kind of getting into
like hocus-pocus territory with
overclocking where you just start doing
things just because they might do
something but you're not actually sure
so that's kind of where we are right now
I genuinely am unsure if that's helping
or not but we have plugged in and then
for the bench so the X 299 dark board
we're using has a set of switches on it
that sorry about the fan noise but you
know part of what we're doing here so
it's Godley's switches where are they
can't see them from here they're down
there they're like kind under the first
video car you're not really gonna be
able to see them for that angle but
that's okay
so there's how many six five or six
switches down there and they're just dip
switches and all they do is they toggle
the PCIe slots by Hardware on and off so
what I've done right now is I have
toggled off all PCIe slots except for
the first one which will allow us to
challenge line it's a single card score
without having to remove the card and it
will also disable it physically on a
hardware level so we don't have to worry
about the nvidia sli software getting
buggy so that's that's part of what
we're doing and i need to i you know it
let's let's just do like a simple OC
first actually you know let's just run
it with with the cpu and no present GPU
overclocked at all just see where it
lands single card it should be like 6500
something like that points and then
after that i'm gonna beat linus to score
pretty much immediately so as long as
everything stays stable anyway so
hopefully does okay so where is
hall-of-fame working it that's the first
question
proxy error i'm three marks website stop
stop it stop breaking it i need it let
me open up Linus's page again
twitter.com slash lioness tech and of
course it's all friendly competition we
very much appreciate that Linus and jf
contributed to this J I was talking with
him and both of us feel like we've
learned a lot from this whole adventure
so we really appreciate the audience
kind of enjoying this and and sharing it
with us cuz III think J I can at least
speak partially for you here but not too
much of course but I know when I was
talking with J
we're just saying how this is really
pushing us to learn a lot more about
overclocking and speaking for myself
that will greatly help G ends review
process for Bart's cuz like now I mean
I've learned a lot in the last week I've
learned about memory straps for example
so kingpin was in chat teaching us about
that where if you're just joining we're
running baseline test right now by the
way it's not doing anything special its
overclock on the cpu ice-bucket what
temperatures are water at
and it's kind of hot one point seven
degrees Celsius and yes just overclock
on the CP in the memory nothing on the
GP is just yet so we're just gonna see
where it lands anyway so learning
memories how so it's one of things we
learned about so I think on it should be
the same strategy for an example I'll
top my head I think at one point I found
that like 980 megahertz was scoring
better than a thousand Eiger it's offset
that is on the cards we were using the
twenty ATT eyes and that's because it's
kind of like a landing pad where you
kind of shoot for a certain frequency
offset and even you land on the memory
strawberry don't and to pay on that you
might actually get slightly worse
performance with a higher number so it's
better step back down something like 980
versus a thousand so we if you missed
the content we've been able to get up to
a 12 40 megahertz offset on the memory
and originally before going liquid for
everything we were stuck at 980 to I
think about a thousand and five
megahertz on the XE ultra so pretty big
improvement and the core is more stable
the cores underwater we have a couple of
memory blocks on here this is not by the
way the the best way to measure
temperature neither is a thermal camera
I know a lot of people like to use them
they're good for like a really quick
spot check but the problem is emissivity
and reflectivity so if you point like a
thermal camera or this had a reflective
surface or a shiny surface then you
might actually get reflected room
temperature instead it's like if I take
a thermal camera and pointed at an
aluminum heatsink it's gonna reflect
more room temperature than the heat sink
temperature but this is fine for
blackbody measurements of like like an
SMD for example a matte black device
that just gets in this case you just hit
it with the pointer and it's it's fine
like it's not great thermal couple would
be better but I can't really get T
couples in there anymore because it's
all surrounded in fans so the side of
the memory module I'm reading the
hottest module we have is currently is
it running a test even know it's about
to run a memory test but in between
tests we're at about
twelve degrees Celsius and so the reason
that's interesting they did not even
finish okay what a crash on CPU all
right cool
let me boot in and see what's going on
with CPU settings and he was playing
around so the reason the reason that's
interesting is because we're below
ambient temperature with devices that
are not cooled by the chilled water and
that's just because the the block that's
on there that's connected to the chilled
water is able to cool everything around
it to an extent that it's going below
ambient so even our memory is benefiting
from this so if you think about it it's
all copper traces inside a PCB anyway
there's a lot of layers inside the PCB
and those are feeding into everything so
it's eventually making its way oh there
we go that's why I have this set to high
so it's eventually making its way into
the memory and the BRM and everything
1.46 I think is unnecessary for this so
let's just step that down and I think
all these other voltages are still good
I think that was the problem
everything else looks fine so let's
let's go back to try that it looks like
I had two cores that were still offset
to hide from when I was really really
pushing a little too hard someone says
three mark Hall of Fame's backup so
before it dies again
I need this don't go don't go there I
need it I'll show it on the screen
uh-huh leave it alone damn it it's down
so we got one to load we got the two
card scores to load I guess I'll show
that while the the things opening up
over there so we're not doing capture
sorry I have the screens too much work
right now with all the other stuff we
have going on all right so here you see
that okay we've got this is to card this
is not what we're gonna challenge Linus
in right now
two card dev our of course Roman if you
know I'm from he's on YouTube he's these
Germany's got a Taiwan flag there
because he's in Taipei right now working
at ACC HQ with some over overclockers
other overclockers excuse me and so
that's why that's showing up to ip-based
I don't know why can Canada's showing up
for Jay and Paul maybe it doesn't
understand that CA for California
doesn't mean Canada so there are 16,000
248 he has an absurdly high GPA score
we're not gonna be able to beat it we're
in seconds over to card
Jay did your score upload it did 50
thousand to 34 so serious improvements
for J score for our score the last few
days J has been I think he's been
experimenting with dry ice I'm really
looking forward to that video J if you
post it and J's two sons if you don't
know who he is of course is on YouTube
and then a single card we have a KP at
the top so this is Ken pen he works for
EVGA he is unbeatable for us and most
other people 93 hundred points and then
we have Ritchie from our patreon group
in there he sent over some water blocks
as we we were kind of limited on those
resources he's at 80 805 and - is in 7th
at I can't read that from here 83 60 and
then we have J who as I said hasn't
tried recently at 82 21 and we're down
here at the Titan be at 80 to 85 so okay
let's go ahead and just post that
baseline now that I hopefully corrected
the CPU clocks it was a little too too
aggressive for this so we're just gonna
let that run this time without crashes
and crashed on the CPU test so that was
pretty clearly the problem and then I'll
show you some of the overclocking trips
that tricks I've learned over the last
few days from the experts in the space
we of course are nowhere close to their
level but it is it's a lot of it's it's
pretty enlightening to learn from them
and I have a ton of respect for for
everyone at XYZ space and like builds
ride their Bower came to everyone
because just like even just doing this
which doesn't even dry ice or Ellen to
it was a lot of work it's not easy and
there Bauer said in his video she should
watch if you haven't that that the Linus
text was just posted did they what did
they post Tamara said you know it wasn't
easy for him either he had to do a lot
of work to get the his score where it is
did they post it now why'd you say that
all right okay all right so we've got a
couple store orders thank you very much
this is running now baseline test we
have a CPI 5.0 5.0 for the first two
course was it no 5.1 for the first two
cores 5.0 for the remaining 16 core is
around a 79 80 XE get that meme out of
the way and that's pretty decently
overclocked right now we could not get
this high without the chilled water and
I'm not looking at CBO times right now
is
I hope it's okay but our water tempers
are still kind of hot for my taste it's
1.1 degrees Celsius and the loop
temperature for the GPU is 3.3 degrees
we have two thermocouples in there so if
you're curious can even can you see that
screen top one is the ice bucket and
then bottom-left which probably can't
read from there is going to be the loop
temperature and we have a TK type
thermocouple floating in this rez over
here so that's a k-type thermocouple has
just got some captain tape on the end of
it
and that's reading our reservoir
temperature this is pretty much the
hottest point in the loop we're very
close to it because this is after the
GPUs so that's gonna be some of the
hottest water in there if you're curious
and k-type thermocouple x' if you didn't
know they're extremely useful for
everything but they're really useful for
for example like vrm thermal testing
which we do but k types have some
variants so they have about a plus or
minus two point two degrees Celsius
range in manufacturing of a k-type
thermocouple so if your baseline is say
it's let's say we're measuring something
that is unknown zero degree Celsius
temperature you might have your your
least accurate two K types at negative
two point zero and plus two point zero
but they are perfectly inaccurate so
when a K type is inaccurate it is always
inaccurate to that same degree so if
it's always plus 0.5 off then it's not
gonna change it's not like it's up plus
or minus two point two variance within
the same thermocouple in other words so
anyway that's that one's calibrated so
that measurements where you want it to
be and then I also I'm gonna go through
some super chats through some storage
just did stuff like that I want to give
a quick shoutout so Engadget it's kind
of a mainstream you know tech
publication and gadget ran an article
that was actually very very kind about
all of this overclocking stuff and they
talked I think that the headline was a
what was it like overclocking makes
surprisingly good TV or something like
that and so anyway I wanted to point
that out we really appreciate that
some of the more like mainstream bigger
tech outlets are looking at this because
we think it's fun so I'm glad other
people like you do okay
so couple things we're running CPU tests
now hopefully doesn't crash this time
I've got a few store orders so Mike
all from Beverly in in the US purchased
a mod mat thank you very much Michael so
that's the anti-static mod mat the one I
have on the table really it's more of
its it's a high quality building service
we've been selling it for about a year
now and we're we we like a lot it's it's
done well if they hold up to all of our
damage so thank you Michael for buying
one of those they are shipping now or
not on backorder anymore we got them in
we got a store order for two of our
ceramic mugs which I have back here as
well so we got two of the mugs in and
that is from or purchased from Jerry in
Oklahoma Thank You Jerry for buying that
really appreciate it does not come with
the dead stick of memory in there we
took the other one apart to use for an
animation coming up for our part two of
our memory timing series so if you
reckon if you notice that one of the
sticks is gone that's where it went
we're animating some Ram Robert from
motors that Utah purchased some stickers
and decals thank you much Robert and
then we got another order from Richard
in the UK who purchased an autographed
Maud map now I'm actually driving over
there tomorrow to sign a bunch of mod
master people who bought them so that
you're picking that up Richard in the UK
alright so this just finished its passed
here's where a base line is this is no
no nothing this is just the CPU
overclock CPUs at 12,000 437 there's a
single card testing we're at 70 623 and
our graphics is only 70 136 but we know
we can get a lot higher than that and
Linus's score if I can get it to even
open I have their Twitter page open so
Linus the score is 83 60 and I what I
really need to know is what's their
score individually for graphics in CPU
but they're 8360 we're at 76 23 right
here which is below I think even our
previous yeah it's below our Titan B
score so clearly we have a lot of room
let's just go ahead and see what we can
make happen here with a quick overclock
hopefully it's still stable I haven't
haven't run this since it obviously
booted so sometimes the clocks kind of
seem like they change a bit so what I'm
doing right now is I'm gonna set some
hotkeys and I'm going to use those to my
full advantage to try and make sure we
push Linus to score down as much as
possible because it's just beating it
wouldn't really be that fun we got to go
as far as we can
11:30 so I'm gonna
set this for what I want this for one
and then I want a 170 offset with a 12
let's see 12 20 on the memory I know it
can hold 12 40 but it's been kind of
having some problems today so let's go
12 20 on the memory offsets still very
high can't be mad at that really just up
that for profile 8 we're going to go to
1 165 and 1180 so 165 is gonna be our
GPU core offset memory we're offsetting
by 1180 megahertz and that will go for
profiles 7 and I'll walk you through why
I'm doing this in a moment because you
probably I don't know I I never heard of
this before this week so this is
something I learned that actually really
fun it makes it more like a game like an
RTS than anything so we want 1164 this
and 175 for the core that's gonna be
profile 4 and then we want 165 and in
wha 1160 is that 1160 yes for profile 6
ok so now I'm just gonna set the
hockey's hey Jacob or EVGA if any of you
are watching a TV ga here's what I want
I want this to save I don't know if
there's a way to do it but when I try to
click the Save button it doesn't do
anything maybe I'm on an old version
that's from a few days ago maybe a week
ago but I have to retype all that stuff
in everything I do and it's super
annoying so if anyone from EVGA is
watching please make that like just make
an export button that saves it to like I
don't know XML or something so I can
import it save me a ton of time ok so
let me just double check our settings
here so profile 9 this is gonna be our
boot profile 140 offset and 1180 on the
memory powers maxed out we're on the X Z
ultra card which is a shunt modded and
underwater profile 8 I mean check that
the hotkeys work profile 8 170 offset
core 12 20 on the memory I think we do
1240 profile after that I'm gonna go to
7 is 165 core 1180 memory and I'll again
walk through why we're doing this in a
moment and then we're at 175 and 1164
profile for with profile 1 being the
lightest at 11:30 and 140 ok cool
everything's working so let's just go
ahead and hopefully it survives us Ron
it's kind of iffy and we will have
artifacting in here so I'll take a
moment to address that you see
artifacting in these Ben
marks it's still valid so as long as the
score validates in 3d mark this is a
synthetic test nothing about this is
real-world we have half the computer in
a bucket of ice so this is not a
real-world scenario and if there's
artifacts you know unlike the real world
where of course you would care it
actually doesn't matter as long as it
passes and it's not cutting out geometry
or meshes or texts or anything like that
if it's just memory artifact and that's
acceptable within times PI's validation
process
I talked to builds right about this I
said you know what's how would you
explain why that's acceptable and he
said I thought it was a great analogy he
said I'm pretty sure if you are drag
racing crashed okay so we need to drop
that a bit so I'm pretty sure if you
drag race and you still make it to the
finish line first but a few pieces of
your car came off you still win and I
think that's actually a great point so
we need to drop one of those a bit looks
like I should probably dial it back a
bit for starting and on we're gonna have
some noise from moving this around some
of that ice melted and
