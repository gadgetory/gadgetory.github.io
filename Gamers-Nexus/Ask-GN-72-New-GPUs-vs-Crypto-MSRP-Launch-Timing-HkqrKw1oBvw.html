of ask GN I think we have some good
questions this week but I can't I can't
presently see them so you just have to
trust me
pretty sure one's about Nvidia there
might also be one about Intel and AMD to
give you a bit of a preview I guess if
you have questions for next week leave
them in the comment section below or if
you're on the patreon discord you can
post them to ask GN chat and also
she'sshe's supposed to do that out of
the box they're almost saying before
that this video is brought to you by
thermal Grizzly makers of the conductor
hot liquid metal that we recently used
to drop 20 degrees off of our coffee
leak temperatures thermal grizzly also
makes traditional thermal compounds we
use on top of the IHS like cryo not and
hydro not pastes learn more at the link
below so couple things starting out
first of all and ext saw our hashtag
please puck from last week where we
basically jokingly although some of you
didn't didn't seem to clipping on that
jokingly said tweeted NZXT and asked him
for a free puck now I guess it was a
half joke because they have given out
free pucks in the past but no one was
really expecting like 500 tweets so
they're not gonna give away 500 sorry
guys if you got one awesome but if not
they started a contest from it because
they were like hey your please Park
hashtag has 6 million impressions on
Twitter which is more than any of your
single videos has ever gotten so we
should give some away so yeah I I don't
know the full details go to NZXT Twitter
page all I know is that we will be
giving away a small box of Gian March
with their prize so I think the first
place person for whatever the contest
guidelines are will get I'm pretty sure
a puck and a puck gamers nexus shirt
which I have worn previously and also a
small box of our merch so I think
they'll probably be like a shirt sticker
or something like that let us know what
your shirt size is if you win but yeah
so check that out I guess didn't really
expect that to happen also very briefly
before the first question our mod mats
have a date kind of on the next restock
so the first run sold out completely ran
out of them we took all the feedback we
mostly been that we need to order more
of them and those should be exiting
production sometime
I think we're planning to be able to
ship them by end of March to early April
that's the current timeline for it so
that's after shipping production all
that stuff we should have more available
if you've been interested in one store
documents Nexus dotnet slash mod matte
to backorder one will have probably
enough to get everyone who back orders
one in the first shipment unless it goes
absolutely crazy but I think we've
ordered enough to prepare for that so
yeah check that out thank you for
supporting it but let's get into the
first question so the first question is
from Brom
who says with the rumor of new NVIDIA
GPUs being announced end of March at GTC
what are your expectations for the new
GPUs regarding crypto do you expect a
little availability hiked prices things
like that first of all I'm not sure that
those rumors are substantiated by
anything for it
GTC I don't I'm not sure where they
originated but I have no idea if a card
is coming out at GGC sometimes they do
sometimes they don't the last few years
it's been more science community driven
than it has been gamer driven I would I
don't know I I'm not expecting a card
for gaming at GTC I'm really not it
could happen and that'd be great and
we'd all be happy for it but it's not
presently something that I'm expecting
given the state of the current market
now as for availability and I hope I'm
wrong on that but it will see there'll
be a new card at some point obviously I
just I don't think it's gonna be that
soon but anyway availability I typically
with with the Pascal and video launch
there was a lot of availability at
launch so if they follow that previous
trend and if they're in production now
there should be a lot of cards available
and I guess it'll depend on how good
they are at crypto mining but I don't I
I know what NVIDIA ships for volume with
Pascal and previous architectures and
it's a freaking lot of cards so really
unless the the demand is that insane I
don't think it'll be impossible to get
one like the first day or two or three
they might sell out after that that's
not too atypical these days but I don't
think it's gonna be as limited as the
cards are today I certainly don't think
that'll be the problem at least not at
an initial launch and I really hope it
won't be the problem as for high prices
I'm assuming the question here is is
basically if I may rephrase it is
basically do you think that the current
price ladder or hierarchy of GPUs will
increase with the next generation in
other words do I think that a $700 10 80
TI will become $1,500 1180 TI - whatever
they call it there hasn't been a lot of
price creep in GPUs over the last few
years other than what's going on right
now but as far as MSRP
it hasn't really crept up that much so
if there's an increase I would hope that
it's inside of a range of 100 to 150
dollars and I don't know if NVIDIA will
do something like they did with a 1080
launch where they had a higher priced
reference card than partner cards but
they really backpedal on that so I think
that might remain one MSRP for partner
and reference cards as for high prices
though the only thing I really foresee
changing the prices in a really solid
like reliable definitely will change the
prices way is the memory prices less
than the crypto miners I really don't
think crypto miners are going to impact
the price for MSRP all that much I think
more likely what's gonna happen is the
20 to 30 dollar increase for 8 gigabytes
of memory will increase MSRP
that's probably what we'll see more than
a crypto impact and there might be a
crypto impact I don't know I it could be
that the next generation is completely
insane with mine if it's anything like
Volta it'll be decent but it's not
it's not gonna now can I flip the
industry on its head or anything for
mine so but yeah at this point all I can
tell you with any level of confidence is
opinions and my opinions for your
questions are well this one wasn't a
question but with the rumor of new
NVIDIA GPUs being announced at end of
March at GTCC I don't think there will
be a new consumer GPU I hope I'm wrong
if there is a new GP announced I think
it's probably going to be data center
enterprise or science driven that is not
fact I don't have any tips from anyone
that's my opinion the next one
expectations for GPS regarding crypto we
can assume that if the next generation
is even remotely close to a mix of
Pascal and Volta we can kind of
extrapolate the performance there's
already Volta mining benchmarks there's
Pascal mining benchmarks
I wouldn't expect the next gaming
architecture to do better than either of
those two do you expect a little
availability no and do you expect hiked
prices yes insofar as memory cost has
gone up and NVIDIA might or AMD or
anyone might capitalize on the shortage
a bit and increase the price a little
bit but I don't expect a 2x cost
flagship GPU and if there is one I
really hope there isn't if there is one
that'll be big news and we'll certainly
be talking about it but I really don't
expect a 2x cost on that that's that's
crazy that's a gigantic jump and I've
seen some reports of that so that's not
what I expect but we'll see this next
question is sacrum Goyal who says should
you deal it a lock to CPU so you can
reduce the heat and keep the CPI maximum
turbo clock say for example deal it in a
high-five 8400 and use a better thermal
compound and keep the turbo at 4
gigahertz locked CPUs for Intel like the
i5 8400 or you can look at the turbo
tables for them and basically the lock
comes down - it's not a case queue they
don't let you over
clock it pretty much end of story it
does not have to do with thermals the
lock is limiting your multiplier
adjustment to the maximum single core
turbo of that processor so what you
could do
deal it to answer the question
immediately no I don't think it's worth
deleting an i-5 8400 at all unless you
you really need it for some reason
and further if you wanted to push that
max turbo clock all the time by a
motherboard that will allow you to
adjust the multiplier and it won't let
you adjust it past the max single core
turbo but you can find one that will let
you adjust multiplier so let's say the
multiplier is something I don't I don't
know top my head with single cores but
let's say it's 44 or 45 X you could
apply 44 or 45 in this case to all cores
all the time through bios with a
motherboard that supports it which is
most of them so that would be the best
way to do what you want you go into BIOS
you set the multiplier to the maximum
number that it permits you to do and
assuming you have a reasonable non Intel
stock cooler on their thermal should
really not be a concern and if they are
them there's a bigger problem with the
case or the airflow or the CPU cooler so
that's how you would you would get I
guess you're saying here you're going
for 4 gigahertz if that's what that
turbo is for the 8400 then you just set
it in BIOS to 40 and tell it to apply to
all cores and you've pretty much solved
your problem so yeah and also if you're
curious you can open up XTU it's an
Intel utility and they have the turbo
tables in there so you can reference
them I think it's on the right side of
the screen and see what one core to core
3 core for core turbo is because
contrary to popular belief I certainly
don't have it memorized and it's
slightly different for different bins of
CPUs so you can it's a really good
utility I would recommend it if you
don't have it on your system and you're
running an Intel processor it's cool
just to see what information it offers
because it's like it offers a lot of
stuff like hardware info does less kind
of information overall but it offers the
more critical aspect like are you power
throttling
throttling current limit issues things
like that it'll tell you in big yellow
letters they can fix it in BIOS next one
is motorsport who says Steve why don't
you use a smoke machine or incense to
show the airflow in cases think people
would really like to see some claims
about how air is moving realized
physically we've done that so we've done
smoke tests in the past I used smoke
pellets for it and I'm sure we have
footage somewhere that's years old of
the GoPro shot I did I like 120 FPS at
the time that was fast but so the
problem with smoke testing with cases
it's a really cool concept on the
surface and we did a pretty good job of
it but ultimately you really only have a
couple of frames even with a reasonably
high speed like 240 FPS because we're
not gonna go to a thousand or something
so even at a reasonably high 240 FPS you
still only have a couple of seconds
where you can actually see the air
channels forming once you start blowing
smoke into the system with the method we
use there's there might be other ways to
do it
I used smoke pellets I'll explain why in
a moment but with that particular method
which I did at the time think was the
best option the smoke would fill the
system so fast that you could kind of
see a channel forming at the beginning
and then that was it so you can't like 5
to 10 seconds after slowing it down to
30 or 60 FPS where you can see the
channel forming it's not that exciting
it was a lot of work to set up it took
me like probably two hours to set up
each time I did it originally I'm sure I
could do it faster now but it was pretty
disappointing for me because I was
expecting more and I think we could do
it better today than back then and I
don't know it might be worth trying
again but smoke testing is it's without
like a proper chamber to do it it's
really hard to get the effect that
everyone wants and there are also some
pretty important side effects of it so
if you use a fog machine you're now
leaving really residue on all the
components you could electrically short
something and the components that oil
doesn't really ever come off speaking
from experience like it you you can kind
of get it off but it's always gonna be
there to some extent and we'd basically
need a special smoke testing rig that
were okay with damaging or killing
components through electrical shorts
things like that you could use something
that doesn't have water vapor in it
because fog machines do so you use
something that doesn't have water vapor
that'd be a smoke pellet I guess you
could probably find like really anything
you could burn and use that but a smoke
pellet is a good option and it's
literally a pellet that you light on
fire and it puts off a huge plume of
smoke that's a good way of doing it
without the water vapor problem you
still have smoke going all through the
computer having done this it smells like
smoke basically forever afterwards all
the components the case all of it like
you can get I left a case airing out
outside for probably a month before the
smoke was mostly the smell is mostly
gone and the components same thing so
it's like we could do it but you have to
set up a special secondary bench that
you're okay sacrificing I have ideas to
get around it I don't know if we'll ever
do it but yeah I've tried it a few
different ways and best case you get
some smoke in there you get a few frames
where you can see the air flow patterns
and that's pretty much it we've found
that through objective testing by
populating different fan slots we've
used tape a lot you may have noticed we
tape off a lot of panels and things and
do all kinds of extra tests we found
that that approach to case testing is
better to understanding the airflow
patterns than smoke it can be done with
objective thermal measurements we can
tape off different corridors of the case
and see how it impacts the temperature
and then through just deduction we can
look at that data and say okay well we
added a fan to the top but the CPU
temperature went up why how does that
make sense we added a fan its intake its
front of the CPU and this is something
that you'll see soon has happened the
answer in that specific scenario was be
found by taping off the top of the case
and the answer was when
the case was when we added a fan it
changed the pressure dynamic of the case
such that the CPU cooler the tower
cooler was no longer pulling air in
through the top even though there's no
fans on the top the pressure would allow
the air to just sort of slowly draft in
and adding a fan to the front made it so
that the air was actually going out the
top instead of in and more of it was
escaping out of the top before it got to
the CPU then got to the CPU so the point
is we've found generally that that kind
of a testing is better to understanding
the pressure and airflow situation than
smoke I would love to do more with smoke
because it's cool to visualize it but
it's very difficult to get it the way
I'm happy with so yeah that's that's
pretty much that one the next one is
from Robert Davidson Robert said I
constantly see people saying that games
don't use more than four cords on a CPU
but I have a 1950 ex and noticed that
several games use all 32 threads to
those games benefit from high core count
and if not will they in the future will
the 1950 X ever be more value in a game
at 3.7 gigahertz than eight threads at
five gigahertz we kind of talked about
this a little bit in our threader for
review I don't think we went into as
much depth then as I would now I
understand it more now so some games
Final Fantasy is a great example Final
Fantasy 15 is one of the few games where
when you launch it from memory at least
with a benchmark it would show every
thread more or less semi populated and
the population of those the utilization
which say of those threads would kind of
decrease as you add more threads but it
would scale across all of them which
looks cool from from like a utilization
standpoint but in some games we've
tested we've found that it's better to
have a higher percentage utilization on
fewer threads than a lower utilization
per thread across a lot of threads and
we've demonstrated this with Rison and
thread Ripper alike these are good
comparisons because they're in the same
architecture family and
it's a core account change there's some
cash some stuff like that frequency
change but we've demonstrated it there
and at least one of our reviews can't
mention can't name it off stop my head
we've demonstrated with the Intel family
CPUs and the high core count CPUs so
where you see like a seventy nine
hundred x79 eight exe in a lot of games
they'll underperform versus an eighty
seven hundred K just like a thread
Ripper CPU can underperform vs. horizon
seven or five CPU it comes down to game
programming some games will leverage the
threads better from memory watchdogs is
certainly one of them that we've tested
where we would see better scaling on
thread Ripper and high core count rise
in CPUs versus the lower court count
rise in CPUs or better scaling on HED T
Intel CPUs which is the standard desktop
ones so there are games that do it but
you also have games like civilization
for example where you would assume
thread count would matter a lot because
civilizations are really AI CPU
intensive game it spins off threads for
AI processing but it's ultimately in
that specific game spinning off one
thread for AI processing and the other
threads are much more minor you'll have
maybe a render thread that deals with
your draw calls you might have a like I
not physics in that game but you might
have some kind of audio thread and what
happens is because you're doing most of
your work on one thread typically render
maybe AI in this particular instance
that thread just needs to be fast and it
doesn't matter really anything a house
so that's an instance where something
like 5 gigahertz on fewer threads might
be better but again watchdogs to shows
the opposite so it depends on the game
to answer your question more directly
let's see well in 1950 X ever be more
value in a game than eight threads the
answer is yes but it depends on the game
and certainly we wouldn't recommend
thread refer for gaming just like we
wouldn't recommend even a 7900 extra
game which is a cheap H ADT CPU we'd
recommend you know the $300 parts from
AMD or Intel because those are more
suitable for it right now but you can
play games on them and there are a few
game
that will leverage those threads but
you've really got to have another use
for it yeah so the answer though
why do threads scale this way look at
something like CryEngine try engine has
a while ago one of the last revisions I
paid attention to before they lost their
minds at Crytek CryEngine at the time
when I was looking at it could do eight
threads it was the first engine that
natively supported spawning of or
saturating eight threads on a CPU and so
what you could do is as developer you
could say I'm gonna push rendering off
to this one
physics here hey I hear something else
too one of the other threads and you're
ultimately going to be bottlenecked by
your most heavily loaded or burdened
thread which is probably render and if
if you're falling behind on that one
thread and it's not a really
asynchronous pipeline you're gonna fall
behind on all of them because you're
you're stuck stuck processing whatever
the most there is to do on one thread
which is probably rendering so we have a
really good interview with Sean Tracy
from the star citizen team where he
talks about thread saturation on CPUs
from a high-end game perspective go to
our channel go to playlist I think
there's a star citizen interviews
playlist where like 40 of them with them
and search for Sean Tracy tra see why
it's a great interview probably one of
the best we've ever done with a game
developer and it explains a lot next one
dubs says you mentioned that certain
brands of motherboards will provide
higher or lower voltage than what is
actually reported by software is it
really brand X or Y offsetting voltage
or just the way the components are
tested so some of this can come down to
how the motherboards built not
necessarily by the brand but
specifically what I think I was probably
referring to there is some boards like
gigabyte boards will be a little bit
more generous with their voltage
provision than others we saw this with
KB Lake when it launched so we saw this
with coffee lake when it launched where
auto voltage
on either one of those platforms would
result in voltage that was way too high
you'd have a 90 degrees Celsius CPU and
you could drop the voltage of something
like one point one eight one point to
something and sustain sixty degrees
instead of 90 and it was still be
perfectly stable so that's probably I
was referring to there are auto voltage
tables there LLC tables those things
change between brands and that is more
of a brand thing because it tends to
apply on multiple C or multiple
motherboards from that family razor says
when will side panel fans make a
comeback and try in a number of cases
I've noticed vrm temperatures are
consistently hotter by a small amount of
cases which the left side panel fans
does fractal have any designs making a
side panel for the r6 I have no idea
about fractals plans side panel fans
making to come back stay tuned subscribe
because we have something coming up soon
on that and I'll leave that there
because the rest will be answered in the
content next question Keith bérenger
says if a viewer had an older piece of
equipment they'd like to seek you
compared to a more modern piece would
you consider it as a retrospective piece
of content or do you prefer to work with
modern components that have obviously
more relevant metrics and to what people
search for YouTube in Google this is a
good question we do pretty well with
with retrospectives and with
post-mortems of things because we did
this with a 2600 K in the 2500 K the i7
930 a bunch of old CP is the Phenom 2's
we did last year and that was our
ancient so was the 930 and the content
does reasonably the reason that content
does reasonably in those cases is
largely because a lot of people still
have this or had those CPUs rise and
just launched coffee leak was coming up
everyone wanted to know if they should
upgrade or not so they worked well there
we always will consider looking back at
an old piece of hardware we just look
back at the Raven oh - that's a case
it's not a CPU just because it would be
kind of fun so there are times when
we'll do it just cause it's fun most of
the time obviously hopefully it's
relevant to people like the Sandy Bridge
look back the Phenom look back because
we do need to get traffic to actually
make money on it otherwise
lose money so it depends on what the
component is you know transparently if
if we're gonna lose money I'm looking at
it then it's pretty hard to justify but
sometimes it's worth doing anyway
because there could be just some
satisfaction and looking at for example
the Raven o2 and seeing how it does
today just cuz we really liked that case
so that's an instance where I'd be
willing to lose a couple bucks just to
see how it does today but we can't do
that all the time so it does depend on
what the component is but let me know if
you have an idea of something you want
us to look at because we certainly
consider it I think this might be this
the last one I think this is the last
one so kada lists said apologies if this
has been addressed previously but I was
actually wondering if I could ask about
the people who aren't on camera right
now
I remembered names being thrown around
like Keegan and Andrew and I was
wondering who exactly are all the behind
the scenes people IGN could you describe
their jobs or roles at GN and one or two
sentences for each person so somewhat
chronologically Keegan has been working
with me the longest he travels to a lot
of the trade shows and conventions with
me we do he does a some film and editing
work at trade shows primarily and just
in CES with us he's done copy text with
me twice now in Taiwan so we're pretty
used to traveling and working together
his job primarily those events has been
camera and editing work and lately he's
been doing a lot more logistics help for
me management on the like keeping
schedule side of things Andrew you
mentioned as well Andrew does all of the
day-to-day video editing and rendering
or filming editing he has does work on
3d models that we use so if you've seen
obviously the intro to this video or any
of the other ones and you did that
through blender and basically does
day-to-day video work and also product
design stuff like that
Patrick assists in and at this point
leads a lot of the case testing
so he's more or less autonomously doing
case analysis and then I help as a test
lead and we look at a case and say how
do we want to test this and then he
takes that test plan and goes and does
it and he writes the review so we have
the website gamers nexus not Annette
Patrick's written version of the video
that we produce goes up there he fuels a
lot of the the build and appearances
sections of case reviews he also
programmed our recent a console
benchmarking tool and then we've also
got we have some some additional
assistance as well outside of day to day
operation Ryan helps with some business
development stuff and Eric Hamilton
helps with some news writing and that's
most of the current core team for GM so
questions for next week leave them in
the comment section below
again the mod map we should have them
coming in and going out the door
immediately end of March early April
so get your backorder and if you're
interested we've taken feedback I think
we have some improvements in the pipe as
well and future things will be talking
about later at a later date but I
subscribe for more Zoids patreon.com
slash Cameron's next topside directly we
have a separate patreon as Jen going up
next and that's all for this one I'll
see you all next time
