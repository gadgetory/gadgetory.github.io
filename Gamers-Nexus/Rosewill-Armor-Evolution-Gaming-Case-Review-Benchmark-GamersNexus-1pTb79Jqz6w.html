nexus net and today we're looking at
roseville armor evolution mid tower
gaming case this case comes in a long
line of mid-range roseville cases
reaching down to the are 5 and up to the
thor version 2 and it's planted firmly
in the center of both of those options
with the armor evolution marketed at
around 100 2 115 dollars and the thor v2
being slightly more r5 being slightly
less it's about what the average builder
would be seeking out as for whether the
case will hold up to the extremely
competitive marketplace well that's what
we're going to talk about in this review
first off let's talk hard specs before
we get into opinions the case is sort of
oddly shaped it's elongated more than
the average mid tower and is about the
same length as the massive phantom 820
but it is overall lighter thinner and
shorter than the phantom 820 it's just
the length that matches the same with
the half x this means that the case
theoretically is fantastic for larger
video cards and cleaner cable management
and speaking to cable management the
case has plenty of routing pass throughs
including a functional EPS 12 volt cut
out toward the top of the case imagine
that it actually fits the armored evo if
I may call it that even has a small
cable small amount of cable management
room excuse me on the right side of the
motherboard so there's that the case
also shifts with an overwhelming six
total case fans five of which are 120
millimeters one being to 30 and two of
the 120s have red LEDs if that matters
for you to you there is also a toggle to
disable the LEDs if you'd like to though
it comes at the cost of added cables to
conceal by default there are two 120
millimeter intake fans in this in the
front one rear 120 exhaust fan one side
in take 230 fan and an additional to 120
millimeter fans that are just lied in
the case when it arrives you can mount
these two extra fans in one or two
excuse me of five of the open locations
there's one bottom mount two top mounts
and two internal hard drive cage mounts
i hypothesize that the bottom intake and
top intake locations would be the
optimal configuration but we'll discuss
thermals in a moment the armour
evolution focuses on
ease of installation features sort of
with it offering everything in to list
form and plenty of cable management
solutions as well as a tiny bit of cable
hiding space on the rear side of the
case the performance touting 6 fans
could sound like it's a deal of the
century at $115 but there is a point at
which marketing specs play more of a
role than actual quality so let's talk
about that the armour evolution sounds
excellent from the specs and from the
look of it but from the moment I opened
the first side panel to the moment I
sealed the components inside I found
myself cursing all manner of gods and
goddesses dome you Athena who I must you
interfere with my side panels first of
all because the side panels use the
inferior cliff in design rather than the
hinge option that is emerging and
because the quality of said panels is
suspect to begin with I often struggle
just to remove the damn veins without
risking a bend in the clips they barely
lined up with the case and the elongated
nature of the case meant that the panel
sort of naturally bulged outward
centrally which would be resolved if
Rose wellhead decided to use a third
side screw in the same fashion of the
phantom 820 Orlando air but alas they
did not so it it kind of pops out
centrally and doesn't perfectly line up
and there's their tiny cracks on the top
and the middle and it's just really
annoying so once the panel is finally
open and you've thoroughly exhausted
your list of mythological beings despite
you then run into a new issue the two
fans must be mounted somewhere and of
the five available locations I suspected
that because many of our users would
immediately opt for dual top exhaust
configuration I I decided to do that so
here's what happened god damn
now eventually managed to get the
grommets to stay but given that one of
the fans felt inward just by moving the
system from the table to the floor I
highly doubt that this case can withhold
the weight of a proper 240 millimeter
radiator as advertised rubber grommets
also tend to droop with age if you've
ever noticed those interior cable cut
out grommets so more than a year or two
of this case coupled with typical dust
invasion and I suspect you'll be
replacing them or you may be facing
other problems I wasn't just being
spectacularly incompetent when
installing these either at least not any
more than normally so aside from the
thought of an h100 radiator following
inward and crushing everything this
doesn't seem so bad except for the fact
that the fan could fall screw side down
and potentially jump an icy and cause a
direct short you know aside from that it
seems perfectly fine so at least we've
got cable management features sort of
here's the problem with those when
routing cables through the case it
rapidly becomes evident that typical
practices of running the 24 pin cable
above or below in some cases the 6-pin
PCIe and front panel connectors will
make for a very tight squeeze with this
case but this is minimized in the face
of another issue the HyperX SSD we
install for testing look to be just a
little bit too far to the right toward
the right panel excuse me for my comfort
but I figured it would be ok because who
would possibly design a case that Clips
the SATA connector with the panel well
there's a bit of information I need to
tell you before we get into this the
SATA connector standard is incredibly
weak it's only rated for something
around 70 connection cycles or at least
the first one wise I don't know what the
the modern one may be better probably is
first of all anyone who remembers the
first iteration of SATA drives will
remember it was followed instantly by
regression testing mostly due to the
plastic pin out guide on the drive side
snapping you see where this is going
with a normal SATA cable connected not a
90-degree one the bended ones I close
the panel and saw that the side panel
was applying pressure to the K
people but before I could respond the
cable snapped downward and ripped the
guide off of the SSD effectively killing
it I'd like to quickly then Kingston for
sending us a replacement on a moment's
notice but I don't think most builders
will be so lucky is this entirely rosel
fault no a lot of it can be blamed on
the connector and the K will be in week
and whatever but at the same time I'd
strongly encourage you to use a
90-degree SATA cable otherwise you risk
your fancy reinforce cable being pinched
by the door and potentially being ripped
downward causing the demise of the drive
still I can't help but find myself a
little bit pissed off at the case and I
another few millimeters toward the left
panel and it would have not been an
issue so Rose well if you're listening
please bezel that right side panel or
remove the cages toward the left by just
a few millimeters it'll be so much safer
for users there are a lot of different
SATA cables out there but it's just in
this case save us to use a 90-degree
Bend option as annoying as that may be
so looking past all this we still need
to benchmark the performance of the case
when testing for optimal fan
configuration here is what i found in
chart form you'll see that the dual top
exhaust configuration works best with
our particular air cooler setup though
may change for yours and my initial
hypothesis was that the bottom intake
and top intake fans would be optimal
that was incorrect it turned out the top
two intake or exhaust excuse me fans
were the best setting although bottom
and take top and take with a near second
I believe the difference in GPU
temperatures was so small that it's
within margin of error so I'm not
listening those using no extra fans
actually was more successful than dual
internal intake on the on the hard drive
cages so if your option is dual internal
intake or no fans well it sounds like
you've got two free fans for another
project if you're wondering why this is
the case our air flow testing revealed
increased turbulence near the GPU with
the two extra internal fans mostly
because the GPU was unable to keep up
with the massive amount of air being
spat at it which while normally is not
an issue because of the accelerated air
intake less of the cool air made it
upward toward the CPU cooler
with much of the air sitting around or
below the GPU in between the power
supply so there was it was effectively
somewhat cutting off air to the CPU
although it was in substantial here's
our comparison benchmark for the CPU and
GPU of other cases in this cpu cooling
bench you can see that the armor
evolution clearly outperforms every
other case on our bench and it's
actually quite phenomenal performance
given our the relatively disheartening
build quality of the case the case would
be excellent for intermediate
overclockers and I still stand by my
original suggestion for this case in our
overclocking build but if you can look
past the build quality issues and really
at the end of the day you're hopefully
only building the system once so if you
can tolerate the swearing for a bit
you'll see excellent performance and
return that is just indisputable here's
the GPU chart you can see the half X if
you're familiar with our tests has
historically had the best GPU cooling
performance period nothing came close
and in large part this was due to the
massive side intake and front intake
that are directed toward larger cards
that said the armour evolution
outperforms every case but the half acts
and performs almost identically to the
half X for GPU temperatures so once
again if you want something cool and
cheap in in all aspects of the word this
is honestly a very good option of course
it's going to be a bit louder than the
phantom 820 or other cases with massive
cooling fans but you get high
performance or silence you can't have
both for a low price so what's the
conclusion well as I say in the full
review links below the case suffers from
systematic design flaws but they are all
survivable the only major exception
being the SATA connector issue that
could potentially murder your SSD so for
now now that I've warmed you of it it's
really quite easy to avoid by using an
angled header rather than a straight on
SATA connector look past the poor build
quality and you've gotten excellently
performing case actually the best we've
tested so far but you have to look past
those issues if you're going to be
upgrading or tweaking regularly I'd
strongly urge you to stay away from this
case now I always mention other cases I
would personally buy at this price range
so
here's what I've got to say about that
look into the p280 by antec NZXT s410
and Corsairs c70 all of which are
relatively nearby in price and
significantly better in terms of build
quality performance wise none of them
will beat the armour evolution I mean
that's just how it is the armor
evolution just has really good
performance for some reason partially
because of all the meshes everywhere but
they're going to be a degree or two
warmer big deal that difference is
really quite irrelevant in the face of
most build maybe for an extreme
overclocker you care but that's about it
extreme overclockers should be looking
at open benches anyway but I digress
even Roswell's Thor version 2 and r 5
are better in my opinion on the armor
evolution so I still feel comfortable
recommending this case in some instances
like for our intermediate overclocking
build we recently put up but at the same
time I'm torn about the evos future
Andros well honestly I think you can do
better that's all for this review guys
check out the link below for the full
review and I will see you all next time
