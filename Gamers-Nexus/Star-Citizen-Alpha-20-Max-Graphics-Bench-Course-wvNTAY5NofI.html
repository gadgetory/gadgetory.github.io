dotnet and you are watching our
benchmark courses for star citizen alpha
2 point 0 this one's a bit different we
have to do three or four different bench
runs and that was for our delta scaling
test which shows the performance percent
gain from setting to setting and map to
map because the game is sort of a
disjointed mix of modules right now
there's no one play star citizen button
it's all different modules and we tested
the arena commander flight module for
its reliability and reproducibility of
test results for our card vs card tests
you can see that one in this video where
we basically just set the speed to 86 or
87 and then take one turn and that's
about it the next test is on the arc
Corp in the public test universe where
we just test running from a bridge to
the medical Bay doors and all these
tests are 30 seconds long as always on
we repeat them multiple times for parity
three to five times depending on results
and then we also tested free flight
where we flew sort of toward a satellite
object and an asteroid where the FPS is
hit a little bit harder than just flying
an empty space so that was another test
run and that FPS does seem to vary based
upon which cockpit you're flying and we
were in the m54 all these flight related
tests and the final test was in the
hangar module where we have the asteroid
hangar and just kind of wandered around
the ship for a 30 second circuit and
then repeated that multiple times for
parity so that is the list of
benchmarking course as we used for our
test you can check the full benchmark
with performance charts on the channel
or on the website gamers Nexus not net
if you want to read more or watch more
about alpha 2 point 0 s performance
results overall the games looking pretty
good in terms of graphics you can see
some pretty cool lighting effects going
on depending on which part of the art
court map or other maps that you're
presently occupied and we'll continue
following this as things develop so
check the article for full methodology
