dotnet i am joined by chance ivy from
Epic Games and he is the community
manager on the Unreal Engine so we had
an interesting topic to bring up today
with virtual reality and its design
challenges yeah so it's interesting you
know there's a lot of focus on VR right
now there's a lot of you know people
pouring money and passion into it so
we're seeing a lot of really great
things come out around the viewer space
you know with your oculus rifts it's
really getting what feels like you know
Klaus and it's getting routed into the
mainstream and for a long time there's
been arguing about if it's if it's
legitimate or not I think we're actually
seeing that yeah it is you know it's
really we go you think it's going to
stick the sea I think so I mean epic
sure certainly does we're diving pretty
heavily into it especially on the engine
side yeah with that there's a lot of
people out there making cool stuff and
you know there's a tons of things you
can download now that are like spaceship
or cockpit simulator right because it's
like natural meter sitting here in this
chair right and you can imagine yourself
doing something that doesn't require
anything but you sitting here and what's
cool about VR actually taking off and
getting its legs is all of the weird
design challenges that we've run into
since the beginning that have made
people sick that have like had to try to
break the whole my head's doing this
thing but my fingers are trying to be
the thing that moves my person around
that break a lot of that's being solved
now so not everything is solved there's
still a lot of you know wild west of
yarn if you will but it's it's an
exciting time to be a part of it and I
remember I remember the first time I got
simulation sickness from it and I was
like I think I might be done for a bit
so what about things like what aspects
of traditional game design are the most
heavily influenced by VR are there
certain accommodations you have to make
and it specifically for B or right yeah
so there's a really great document
written up by Nick who was the technical
technical designer take the artist I
guess it's kind of all over the place
Nick's benedek
a little bit of everything but it talks
about some do's and don'ts for design
it's things like stairs are not great
but lifts are good and a lot of that it
comes down to the fact that in VR we
haven't found a way and I don't really
know that there is one to accurately
emulate or simulate force acceleration
and actual sense of gravity that is
separate like in a video game you can
flip a car and I've made VR games before
that are in a car and the minute you
flip it it's like you know the game says
gravities that way and I say gravities
that way my mind's like I don't really
like anything that's going on right so
with that it's you know something you
have to keep in mind when it comes to
rotation of the head it kind of has to
follow gravity always kind of has to be
in the same place there are some ways
around that like if you're doing a space
simulator right you're flying a jet in
space because you can you know suspend
your disbelief just enough to know that
oh I I really shouldn't feel I the
weightlessness feeling should kind of be
here even though still sitting and it's
okay for my plane to flip upside down
and and do those things but that's been
one of the bigger ones that that it's
been kind of a no no it's is the same as
well looking for your car and your
according to slam into the wall your
bodies have that inertia a forward
motion that comes that sudden halt as
well and so that's something that'll
really you know put a put somebody into
a little bit of a shock state why why
are stairs bad so I think a lot of that
too is the fact that when you move
upstairs you expect you expect your body
to be doing things like that kind of
have like a step step step step you know
that Bob you don't want to mess with a
camera in VR either you want it to kind
of say the same so stairs kind of move
like forward and backwards left and
right move into VR feels almost natural
enough because you don't have enough of
that acceleration but when you have
steps that are going up you can feel the
the extent of gravity as you move right
so imagine you're walking up stairs or a
ramp anything like that walking up or
down those you can feel that changes
and where your body is and how gravity
is affecting you in that I think the
reason that the lift is different like I
get into a lift you know like an
elevator or something that if things
move directly around you that is
something that the body understands like
the right right it's it's a it's very
much up and down and then we've got this
round this way it's when you start to
mix those two things get a little weird
there's probably some great science
behind why that works but it's some of
the information we've extrapolated from
testing and seeing the things that have
made us throw up on our computer so you
mentioned a few design don'ts with VR
like stairs yeah are there any any
elements of design that are almost
exclusively introduced because of ER or
is there something that has a design
you're drawn more toward using with VR
game yeah it's interesting it's
interesting thought a lot of people are
looking at cockpit simulators because
it's the things that it's the my head
moves I'm sitting on this chair and this
is this is where I normally operating
game so i'm playing first-person
shooters i'm putting my head into the
players head right but i think there's a
lot there's a lot to be discovered and
found out by taking the camera out of
the players head not not switching
between the two that is extremely
drawing but having it somewhere else in
the in the game that is actually
watching the player it's less about head
tracking and more about the stereoscopic
and feeling like you're looking over
something at with that as well like
people are having great success in
putting outside of the game space people
into places that either don't really
exist don't really exist anymore or too
expensive to go to write like I think
there was something they just happened
to coachella with Paul McCartney that
you there was like the last 60 candles
on stage that you could like take
control of it like I'm actually there I
think we're going to see a lot more of
that too so I guess we'll close out here
with you work on Unreal Engine of course
yeah to community management there a lot
of our audience are necessarily game
developers by trade but if they wanted
to play
with it I where where should they go to
learn marble engine no that's great so
with Unreal Engine you know it's it's
free to download for you to use and it's
available at any religion com you can
just sign up for a free account there
download it start playing then and we
have like set out of the box vr support
so if the arch thing you can just pick
up your DK 20 or DK one or anything that
we've been working with the Crescent Bay
prototypes as well and a slew of other
devices as time rolls on the stream has
more info of all that stuff to it but
yeah it's kind of plug and play at this
point and it's really great it's it
takes hardly nothing to get started so
always good news so check out links in
the description below for more
information on all this coverage and we
will see you all next time right
