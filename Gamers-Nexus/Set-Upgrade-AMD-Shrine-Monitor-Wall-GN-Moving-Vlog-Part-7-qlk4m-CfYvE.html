series at this point reworking the set
this was kind of a temporary addition
for the main set the big table this is
meant to be for the live streaming set
so will be pushed over there and then we
got a tabletop in and then from
autonomous that the company that makes
so the auto raising and lowering desks
we got a pair of legs in from them so
thank you to autonomous for those and
picked up a tabletop to go on that then
we're going to customize so the plan is
go back to the corner style setup where
we're gonna have basically the shelf
here we'll load out the shelf with
something I don't know this Patrick just
threw this on here for now to see if
everybody would get mad at the excess
and video boxes because clearly that's a
big sign and means something so we're
gonna load in the shell with some kind
of stuff I don't know why yet put the
table and diagonally it'll be raising
lowering which will be awesome for
b-roll shots and this will more or less
stay where it is this kind of stuff here
needs to be finished and then this will
go to the live stream set so that's part
of what we're doing today the rest of it
is going to be acoustic paneling and
then I don't know if it'll be a separate
video or what but we'll have a noise
test with the foam paneling there versus
not they're not versus having all the
stuff in the room so we can see if it
actually does anything before that this
video is brought to you by us and the
gamers Nexus store at store gamers Nexus
net you can pick up one of our mod mats
now on backorder because they keep
selling out or you can grab one of our
other products like the Raglan 2-tone
hoodie which we have in stock or the
full gamers Nexus logo t-shirt that we
just restocked in cotton and tri-blend
flirtin more at store doc gamers Nexus
net
other sides better
so the side we had on top will keep as
the top okay let's bring this out there
and just put it on the
so I hate staining things and Sandy
veins but for this we did the previous
table what came out looking really good
and a lot of that was just standing
there before working on it so that it
really helps the stain kind of stick and
it brings out the woodgrain more so give
it a bit of a stand that's all the
imperfections out
and let it take the stain on the
polyurethane more there's a bug please
do not become part of my table oh
there's this let's put this thing
somewhere so you're never gonna be here
well
is that is that the shrine to AMD is
that what the prophets of / r / AMD have
foretold the gamers Nexus sticker drawer
so we have Asus stickers including a
passport and a credit card then some
very distant gigabyte stickers including
a passport and a critic and all these
packages where they gave us these
stickers they gave us the coasters - oh
really yeah we actually use the coasters
Thank You asus our whole office is
filled with asus coasters some week we
could use more if you have on
ugh poster ug stickers this is one of
EVGA s posters
come on EVGA who hangs posters up
anymore okay so I've just been an orange
by Patrick that this says one three
three seven EVG I don't know if that
makes it better or worse the ACX fire
sword and they're all pads scandal
what's hot just cleaning off did a
sounding pass on it to sanding passes on
it
smooth out the grand a bit it'll let the
stain stick a bit better and also will
help the grain texture stand out better
and so now I'm just cleaning off all the
sanding dust before doing this the
staining and the polyurethane because
there's a bunch of dust on here now from
that so next step will be starting the
actual stain and finished process we're
going to go with the grain for this and
try and minimize brush strokes first I'm
just kind of trying it out to see what
the color looks like and how heavily I
need to apply it really don't need a lot
of this stuff can do multiple coats if
we need to just have to sand it with
steel wool after to get some of that
polyurethane layer up because it is a
combo I'm not doing staining and
probably everything I'm trying to do it
all in one go which I have not done
before I've always stained it first
stained it first and then done the
polyurethane coat but we're gonna give
this a shot just cuz he and I are flying
to Germany tomorrow that's kind of ready
and I really don't want to have to deal
this when I get with this when we get
back because we're gonna be dealing with
probably products so I want this done
before leaving
so we're mostly done with the actual
move part now and we're on to finalizing
the move but also office upgrades we
just got a shipment of six berta Gator
chairs in so thank you Berta gear for
setting those over I don't know we'll
we'll build these maybe do like a race
of building them versus each other
itself like a speed build I don't know
but we got six chairs in the wall so all
the foam paneling is more or less done I
don't have a lav mic on right now so the
audio is because we're using a shotgun
mic no laughs but yeah foam paneling is
mostly done we have the set table is
outside drying right now so we're still
standing it probably retain all that
stuff so set tables coming on pretty
nicely we're gonna build that up with an
autonomous one of the autonomous like
raising lowering legs for b-roll
purposes so that'll be pretty nice and
we also have a four hundred dollar light
that is stuck to a two hundred dollar
piece of metal so I need to figure that
out and I think we're also maybe going
to install some monitor arms so a lot
going on for today's video as we
continue to upgrade the office and start
making use of it so pretty gear SL 5000
that's the chair and I did want to point
this out so we've built a few chairs
lately office chairs like straight
office chairs it's from Amazon that are
no-name brands and gaming chairs one
thing that none of them have done is
ship with an actual tool that you might
want to use later so I will say we're in
here thank you for providing an allen
key that actually has like a handle and
some torque to it and you can actually
get it in where it needs to go cuz long
enough so thank you thank you for
actually doing that I mean sure we have
plenty of allen keys it's not like we
need one but I think for most customers
probably having a decent tool included
is a huge upside so I'll give them that
for sure that's that's definitely
definitely helps push the ease of
installation angle of the chairs there's
a gas pump and think all the other parts
are mostly pillows so head pillow back
pillow I don't use those I just use the
chairs straight as is these days but if
you like them I guess they're nice and
then this is the bottom part of the
lever and pump and then the chair base
so time time to build some chairs oh
yeah also also where Daguerre has the
Noctua chrome axe rollerblade wheels
where's the why does it even do that no
but seriously though I I don't underst
berta gear I don't understand this box
you have perplexed me so I can open here
it's meant to open but also you can just
push it off it's my IQ is too low to
understand this so Berta gear sent six
of these over we didn't ask for much
help with the office move I paid for
almost all the furniture like Gian paid
for all of it
all the furnitures make expensive but
Christophe adverting here previously
worked at be quiet as PR now a verdict
you reached out and asked if we wanted
some help with the chairs and I was
happy to take the help at this point so
we've got six of their chairs to build
put them together we're gonna use them
in the testing room and the production
room and overall I mean like sincerely
not just because they sent our stuff the
quality is significantly better over the
last time I worked with a verdict your
product so if it's been a while for you
then it
look like they've they've improved a bit
but they've changed over personnel and
stuff a bit too so yeah we're gonna
build these I need to find Patrick not
sure where he went off to but we're
gonna put them together once I find him
so I'm replacing the all the door
handles and the previous tenant really
rounded out these two screws I went and
after and started retyping this one
that's why it's basically Oh circle at
this point but even that one you can see
from the previous town it's pretty
rounded out this one was worse it was
not salvageable so I just started
drilling through it to take the head off
then I came across the realization that
I probably just kind of tap it out like
that and it's actually rotating so I
found this trick from just the YouTube
channel it was called the ultimate
handyman or something like that it's
pretty good trick I got it to do a full
rotation so far so I'm gonna go for
another couple rotations on it and then
I'll be able to extract it with just
pliers and twist it so yeah it was a
original was going for a drill bit kit
like this
except using a smaller one I've got got
a couple different sizes in there but
you drill with a smaller size one in
Reverse and then you flip them and drill
again and it'll bite it and pull it out
wasn't having any luck with that so I
switched over to just using a basically
chisel and hammer and that's working
extremely well so far as you can see it
just kind of it rotates a bit so I don't
have infinite shots of this
but I've got enough to back it out
another maybe one or two turns and then
I can then I can just extract it
normally right okay there we go
so I ended up just once it was loose
enough I'd stuck that under there and
just popped it out I got a longer screw
to replace it so the threads and they
are definitely old janky now cuz I mean
this ripped all the wood out but I'll
put a longer screw through on the we're
gonna replace this anyway so we're gonna
replace this whole thing and replace the
handle and put a longer screw in and
then we'll be good to go and this is
going straight to the trash but that was
really good trick though cuz these
screws were both super rounded out by
whoever worked on this door last sadly I
think it was actually a locksmith and
nor the person before him maybe this
one's clearly I mean I can work with
that but the top one was there was gone
so so I tried to use the bit to extract
it and that certainly rounded it out but
I didn't really have much confidence in
it the problem is if you drill through
all the all the head you kind of limit
your options on removing it on
extraction so I ended up just cutting it
short on those I haven't used them
before anyway and I did the tap method
where you get a flat head and just
lightly hammer it in and it turns so
that works great and we're good to go
now we can replace this handle
throughout those screws and never use
them again and okay so verdict here we
know that you really care about your
products getting here on peace but you
don't need all of this leather and foam
to pack the cupholders I should my thumb
oh yeah that's definitely okay sweet
well Verna Gareth job well done like
seriously the first time when Keegan and
I built one of the vertigo chairs chairs
several years ago when they were new and
he was the S all4 thousand or three
thousand or whatever when we built it
this these are arms
snaps first all a much longer direction
like way forward with far greater force
to the point that I didn't want
employees building but this is way
better so vertigo seriously job well
done on improving that and managing to
make your ease of installation process
superior to your competitors in the
gaming chair space because there are a
lot of them now so anything to stand out
and be not dangerous is a good
improvement alright so here's your
comparison this is the original one he
and I built genuinely we were afraid of
it we were actually afraid of this arm
and the way it released and snapped so
hard with such force and Noble chairs
Thermaltake Corsair HyperX everybody who
makes a gaming chair it's pretty much
the same suppliers some of them are
finally started to differentiate
themselves but it's taken a long time
and because they're the same suppliers
they all have had the same flaws one of
which again was the snapping mechanism
that on some of the chairs like noble
chairs had actually a big like keep your
fingers away from this warning so that's
improved on this bottle so that's good
it's no longer dangerous it's a big
improvement there the arm rests are the
same these you know I'll be honest
of course we appreciate the chairs but I
got to keep it real ready gear I don't
really like the arm rests it's the same
problem that again every single vendor
has so it's not just ready gear its
verdict your noble chairs HyperX
Thermaltake Corsair everybody else who
makes a gaming chair buys the arms from
the same supplier and there are hard
plastic so we actually buy these for
them and then they become great so it's
like an 8 or 15 dollar pad you can get
an Amazon so that makes them better but
as far as the rest of the chair so for
the original model it has this bump in
the middle which I did not like so
that's gone here it's just a flat bottom
now it's got ventilated holes in the
bottom so a big improvement over the
original
and the white on the original did not
age well with like belts so you can see
like how the belt marks have worn off on
it from black leather belts and stuff
like that so this chair overall though I
haven't really used it yet but it does
at least from a quality standpoint
appear to be significantly better in the
ease of installations better so overall
on the up for vertigo with the chairs
and hopefully some of the other vendors
can follow suit because a lot of the
gaming chairs are just they're just
clones they're like all clones of each
other so looks like we've got some work
to do build another five of them
certainly a better overall quality and
build experience than this original one
from several years ago we kind of gave
up on Verde gear after this one but
we're gonna give her after sending these
over I'm willing to give it another shot
so thanks just kinda head over we'll try
it out and give you some feedback let
you know what we think of it follows
this stuff so I brought in one work
shelf of tools and yeah I mean otherwise
this is all back to a better version of
what it was at the old location so back
to a corner shot those scopes back some
people were we're very upset that it
wasn't there the first few shots like
takes a while guys takes awhile to move
everything yeah that's our set yes we
can mean find something else to show it
to so a test room test rooms gotten a
lot of upgrades and these monitors are
not permanent we just put them all here
for now so this one's probably moving
but this monitor is it's on an arm and
this is gonna go to one of the two test
benches for thermals so the plan is to
have a thermal test bench here for air
coolers for either Andy or Intel and
then have the opposite brand on this
side depending on how they interact with
each other they probably won't run
simultaneously but we'll see if they
don't influence each other we'll run
them sign on simultaneously so this can
be hooked up to one so it will around be
easily this one these are both 1080 so
they're not really meant for for like
GPU benchmarks they're not good enough
for that so these can both just be
hooked
- thermal test benches and then
Patrick's got a CPU bench here that's
been running so that's up and working
hooked up to an Asus 1440p monitor that
we've had forever they're sending a
second one so we can put that over there
with an Intel test bench still have an
AMD one and in Taiwan and that'll be our
CPU testing we have a filing sorter
thing that we use for open motherboards
so that's pretty useful and then the two
ACS monitors up top they're not 100%
sure where those are going yet but we'll
definitely use for them if only for
production systems so that's this side
this table was raised up and it's a
standing height now the thing about this
table is I'm never gonna be actually
typing on it so keyboard height kind of
irrelevant but all we do is like click a
few things start a throne benchmark and
walk away from it so standing height is
way better for that and then we have
these that our patreon supporters
generously gave to us so thank you to
Xena organized it and a lot of you
contributed thank you very much for
contributing to that effort to our page
shot backers brought us to these Han
type fatigue mats a couple of other
things so this will probably get here
for now the other one will go on the set
or something like that
other than that cooler bench is right
now and liquid metal stuff here power
supply testing set up Patrick stones
been working on it so he's been figuring
out some of that methodology I think
that gets you up to speed on on the test
room so is your office moving blog
update we're getting close to a point
where we're going to be doing more
office upgrading vlogs than moving there
is still stuff back to the house so
today I brought in like I don't know
probably 50 pounds of these just stock
coolers from AMD and Intel at some point
we made bring a bunch of them to a
recycling center that can melt down the
copper and aluminum and actually make
use of it but for now we have them and
it doesn't hurt anything by being here
so yeah all this stuff I've always used
we need to like real able and make it
ours but that'll be nice for small parts
cables stuff like that small heat sinks
all of this stuff is getting close to
final
and I think that updates you on the
office for this one so thanks for
watching as always you can get a store
that gamers access net to helps out
directly we have a couple of things up
there like these that you might be
interested in these are our new mouse
pads it's a pretty good size and there's
GN colors extremely vibrant and we have
those on the store at store to karyn's
like it's not not if you want one
otherwise subscribe for more patriotic
amish gamers next stops I directly thank
you for watching I'll see you all next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
