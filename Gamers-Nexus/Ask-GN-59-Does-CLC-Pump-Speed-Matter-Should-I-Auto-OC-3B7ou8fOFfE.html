of ask GN where we answer reader and
viewer questions if you have questions
for the next episode please leave them
in the comment section below or if
you're one of our patreon backers you
can leave them in the discord channel
called ask GN questions so we've got a
couple good ones this week gonna be
talking about a bit about liquid coolers
I have some overclocking discussion some
stuff on the 1080i hybrid mods and how
to reduce pump noise which we've talked
about in the past so some good questions
but please leave more below if you have
them before that this one is brought to
you by our own GN store so we have a
store at store gamers Nexus dotnet where
you can buy a shirt like this one this
is the anniversary edition shirt and
it's got teal and grey and pretty cool
design it's basically an explosion
layout of PCB and electrical components
except in the shape of the logo and we
just got these in so coal baseball caps
that have the GN Graff logo on them
we're just giving it a trial so that's
over on the store if you're interested
in it and I think we have some photos of
snowflake in front of it just as extra
marketing materials starting to look at
what companies like Intel and AMD and
NVIDIA do I realized one thing is they
are all lacking cats so I think
basically what I'm saying is if we ever
make a CPU or a GPU we're gonna sell the
most because I figured that out so you
heard it here first first question is
from Matt Matt wolf excuse me who says
maybe this is more appropriate here how
important is the CLC pump speed at all
I've played with it yesterday and the
delta is like 1 to 2 degrees Celsius at
most with the pump speed between 50% and
100% rad panspeed seem to impact
temperatures much more yeah so radiator
fan speed definitely impacts it way more
if you you could set whatever pump speed
you want for the most part as long as
it's still moving liquid and you're
gonna see a much bigger swing from going
from like 5 or 600 rpm on some matter
see mid-range fans 1500 rpm that's for
sure
as for the palm speed so we test this we
did some work for NZXT earlier this year
for their blog i don't think we ever
published it on our own site maybe we
should look into it though but we did a
really quick to test one was radiator
placement in their ass 340 elite and we
tested it in 2 or 3 I think 3 different
locations to determine where it worked
the best in the s340 elite specifically
we didn't bring that content over to GN
because it's such a specific a specific
test that even though we could
definitively state where the radiator
performed best in that case the s340
elite that doesn't necessarily
extrapolate out to everything so
basically before we did something with
it on this channel we wanted to test it
in more cases but that's over there and
then along with that test and we also
provided them with some pretty quick
silent versus performance pomp speed
testing and I think this was on annex 42
if I can find the article on their blog
I'll link it below but because it was I
mean it was written by us by Patrick and
I worked on it as well and it reads just
like any of our other articles it's just
it was work done for them
so the silent versus the performance
numbers from memory I think we saw about
a four degree benefit by going to
performance from silent on that radiator
in that case as opposed to an open-air
batch we'd maybe see different results
so about four degrees under load I think
idle temperatures we saw at most it
might have been a degree but I'm pretty
sure the idle temperatures were closer
to less than like 0.5 degrees Celsius
different between silent and performance
which makes sense not under any load so
it's just gonna be as close to ambient
as it can be and yeah that's that's more
allow us to start in the end of it
you'll see a couple degrees different
difference but I think once you start
getting into open loops it matters more
as you get into higher heat loads
in the loop and different setups with
multiple radiators and things like where
you've got a lot more tube lengths to
cover and things like that then it
probably starts mattering more but I
haven't tested that so I couldn't tell
you for sure but for a closed loop
liquid cooler which is what the question
was here it matters a little bit but I
think this relates Matt wolf who was in
chat talking about as the discord
patreon chat was talking about replacing
I believe his hybrid CLC cable to slow
down the pump speed of the CLC so if
this question relates to that then you
could easily run your pump for one of
those coolers at 80% and be perfectly
fine and the noise basically disappears
and there's not really gonna be a
temperature difference so if that's the
kind of point of the question I would
say definitely just lower the pump speed
if it's causing noise for you maybe drop
to like the equivalent of seven volts
for the speed and and you'll be in good
shape and not really lose any
temperature any thermal performance
that's worth speaking of but again that
that's all I know
so CLC's I know pretty well and with CLC
is generally speaking pretty much always
less than four degrees Celsius
difference I've maybe seen one instance
of like five degrees open loops I think
get a bit different as you expand the
loop and things like that you have
different needs so I can't speak to
those the next question is from V
thoroughly oh and this I believe was
posted to YouTube so V Thor says hey
Steve great Channel and great Nick video
content thank you keep it up I have a
question if the next ask GN why don't we
have hardware that's capable of
determinate determining its own limits
for overclocking like why can't
motherboards and graphics cards
specifically a IV partners auto-tune
themselves to the maximum provided some
parameters like fan speed or CPU and GPU
temps and voltages in an ideal world
you'd plug in any C
you two compatible socket and the same
with the GPU and have a button on UEFI
that's labeled OC for me if this already
exists why isn't it more widespread it
definitely does already exist it doesn't
work great so you'll see a lot of
motherboards with I think just as OC I'm
bummin
does this want to have it yeah this
gigabyte gaming 7 I have next to me from
our GPU bench has one on there actually
an OC button and an eco button most
board just have those buttons now MSI as
them in UEFI some of them have physical
switches on the board they don't so two
parts your question I think that what
you're really asking is why can't the
board or the video card determine what
the max performance is and just set it
to that as opposed to why not have a
button that pre overclocks what these
really do is they kind of have a look up
where they go this is a 7700 k let's try
and set it to 4.9 gigahertz at this
predetermined voltage and these two
numbers together work in ninety percent
of use cases so let's just apply that
for the user that's all they really do
generally speaking it's not like they're
sitting there stepping through
enumerated through voltages and
determining the lowest stable voltage
which is what you should do when you're
overclocking because if you don't do
that you're just blasting the thing with
voltage which is one not great for the
CPU and two just a waste of power and
causes more heat so Auto o'seas really
don't work that well at getting you a
good overclock they'll overclock and
most the time they'll be stable because
the manufacturer has basically said we
know that one point three five volts on
a KB Lake CPU will sustain pretty much
any four point nine gigahertz overclock
on those KB Lake CPUs so let's just
apply one point three five volts to
everything that the user hits us button
for and it should be stable and from
that perspective they're correct it
would be stable but it's it's going to
be pretty hot and you don't need it to
be that temperature so what I would
recommend
if you are someone who is either afraid
of overclocking or a little anxious
about it or you just don't have any
experience with it what I I mean ideally
you kind of look around for guides maybe
look up reviews and kind of find what
the mean number is that people can
achieve without extreme measures so
let's say let's take kb lake again as an
example or even Rison let's say with
Rison you know that roughly four
gigahertz is achievable on most our 7s
and with kb lake i sevens you know that
roughly 4.8 to 5.0 gigahertz is
achievable on those so you pick that
number and kind of increment your way
towards that number I would suggest
starting with an auto voltage run a
short test and look at what the voltage
is in hardware info 64 ADA or CPU zo
they're not always accurate look at the
voltage outputs there and then take that
number reboot set it manually and set it
a little bit lower than that maybe a
hundred millivolts lower so let's say
that you go to four point nine gigahertz
and it's automatically adjusting to one
point three five volts so reboot go into
BIOS change that one point three five
number two something like maybe one
point three three see if it's stable
reboot keep lowering it until it's no
longer stable then go up a bit that's
what I would recommend rather than Auto
OC because you're gonna get the best the
best thermals the best power consumption
and it'll be stable as you do it
yourself it does take time but yeah I
there to answer your question directly
there are buttons on a lot of the boards
I just don't like them and I would
recommend taking the approach I just
described
as for video cards these kind of do
already pre overclock so video cards are
really interesting right now and video
has Boost 3.0 they've had it for a while
Boost 2.0 and below basically said let's
say your frequency on the video card was
thirteen hundred megahertz so when it's
playing a game you look at gpu-z or some
other tool it's always thirteen hundred
megahertz it's a flat line with Boost
3.0 it
I jump around between 1280 and 1330
megahertz and ultimately your
performance will be better for it your
power performance is better in terms of
consumption you're probably your
thermals will be better when necessary
your performance in terms of frame rate
will be better but it's still not
overclocked as far as it can be you can
get it a bit further on your own because
they're always a bit conservative and
also it's kind of annoying to try an
overclock with a boost 3.0 and video
card or with an AMD Vega card because
they auto adjust their frequency of it
and and that means that setting a target
frequency just doesn't always work in an
intuitive way
so one item of note here is with the
auto or what adaptive voltage frequency
scale and I think a BFS I think that's
what it stands for is it's a vote
frequency curve so new cards you can go
set a volt frequency curve on Pascal I
have a feeling am these going this
direction as well and with precision it
will actually sit there and iterate
through volt frequency settings and
basically auto set the max clock you can
kind of get without pushing it harder
yourself that would be the equivalent of
this button on a video card Vega doesn't
have it I think AMD will probably go
that direction eventually but it's kind
of their the stuff you want is kind of
there on video cards already it's just
it works a lot better than I think them
the OSC buttons on CPUs but it still
could use user oversight if you want
more out of it it's just it does a good
job on its own next question I was just
one mad wolf again okay we've got two
from him apparently hi Steve to
disassemble a 1080i hybrid for a pwm
adapter install is it necessary to
remove the backplate and basically do
what you did in the teardown video is it
possible to just remove the top cover
where is okay so I have these cables I
just ordered these to do a thing about
this tutorial these came from China
and it's about the only place you can
find them so these are very specific
cables these are the four pin GPU fan
header on this side - 4 pin motherboard
fan header on this side so what you can
do this is where this does loop back
into the first question for mad wolf he
has been embarking on trying to lower
the pump noise of the hybrid cart so you
take it apart to answer the question
immediately yes you take off the back
plate and some of those screws go into
the shroud and some go into the base
plate or the cooling the heat sinks for
the prm's and things you take that all
apart and expose the pump and the pump
header then you disconnect the pump from
the PCB and plug it into this side and
then you plug this ultimately into your
motherboard you get extensions or things
like that is necessary that will allow
you to control the pump speed through
bios like normally like any other fan so
we would wreck if if you are a person
who's like I really like the idea of
hybrid cards but I can hear the pump and
it bothers me this fixes it I think I
spent 10 dollars on these you have to
wait for weeks to get them but that'll
fix the problem so yeah that's just
questions into one right there next
question is from red underscore M who
says Steve could you maybe look at doing
case roundups I personally have a 1/2 X
and I'm curious to know what you look
for in a case for personal systems we've
done case round ups in the past we did
one not long ago for mid towers it was
pretty driven on data I have the half X
as well it was my personal case for a
long time and what I look for personally
so when I'm building a system which I
don't really build computers frequently
for myself I've had I tend to build them
and keep them for like three or four
years because it's got all the business
stuff on there and it's a pain in the
ass to move it all around and like find
everything keep track of all the files
and all that get the environment going
there's a lot of software I need
that is annoying to reinstall and then
you run into situations where in a time
crunch you're like I forgot to reinstall
the thing that I need right now so I
don't really build systems a lot for
myself but what I do like I'm gonna be
using the be quiet dark Bass Pro 900
which is down there under the table I'm
using that for my next build I'm
currently using a throne Rosewell throne
which is similarly large and I before
that I used the I want to say I had it
maybe in a Thor at some point and I had
it in the I wanted to build in the Raven
rv0 - like that case a lot never built
in it and then I also like the half axe
originally I don't like it anymore for a
lot of reasons mostly dust and I think I
before that it was the antique 900 and
stuff like that so basically trend of
large cases I go for bigger cases
because it sits on the floor forever and
it's gonna be there for years I care
more about things like being able to fit
all the components that I want to put in
there and having easy access to maintain
it so the system I have now although
it's old I've gone in there I've
replaced - replaced three coolers now I
have replaced the video card a couple
times the hard drives are kind of
stacked on on the floor of the case but
I can fit a lot of them that way and the
idea is to be able to get in and out and
swap components without having to like
pick the thing up and move it in here
and do a whole hour long process I
wanted to take me five minutes to swap a
component so that generally means bigger
cases I also need a lot of hard drive
bays in my cases we do have an ass but I
have a lot of drives internally so those
are my requirements I care a lot about
thermals the cases tend to be loud I
tend to go for cases with a side panel
intake and when I don't have one I drill
holes in it and put one there so yeah
that's that's kind of what I go for in a
case next question is from Kay real or
Crill 89 who said I asked this Lac last
week I was
the YouTube video a Szyslak last week
twice but probably after you made this
video would need to ask Andy for this so
Andy on my Vegas 64 gets pretty hot I've
seen it get up around 85 see what is the
safe temperature for it to run at for an
extended period of time I also seem to
have a bit when I overclocked the memory
and I don't know what that that part
means but basically what I'm seeing here
is what's the safe temperature for HBM
to and the answer is I just emailed
Sampson I got a response it's not a
number yet but I got a response
basically saying that we'll talk
sometime in the next week or so and
hopefully they can answer my question
I'm not sure if they can share that
publicly it's not always the case so I
don't have a data sheet on HB m I don't
know what or - I don't know what its
specs for cooler is better but I yeah I
mean I just don't know if 9 DC is kind
of the cutoff that tends to be what it
is for GGG r5 x you don't really want to
go above 90 C but uh yeah I don't have
an answer for you but I've asked the
right people and hopefully they can tell
me
so basically stay tuned for next episode
hopefully last question is from idle
voice who says at what point do you
saturate a custom water loop I read some
stuff that beyond a certain amount of
rad space for your extra part for your
parts extra radiator space isn't going
to do jack squat for you what determines
that limit so the limit is basically the
heat transfer rate is proportional to
the surface area and I'm going to quote
some of ESG here from thermal bench
again because he summed it up pretty
well so he was saying heat transfer rate
is directly proportional to surface area
and delta T so adding a radiator affects
both parameters
meanwhile bottlenecks remain the same so
eventually you get to a point where the
heat that can be removed as minimal when
delta T approaches 0 so delta T here is
the liquid temperature versus the
ambient temperature so if your liquid is
24 and your ambient is 23
you're at one that's your Dells a team
value for that so as that number
approaches zero you're kind of hitting
the peak of what you can do and this is
a scenario where adding more radiators
does not give you a linear reduction in
temperature it depends a lot on the heat
load of the system so because it's not a
specific question there are a lot of
openings here to look at it different
ways if you have a system with let's say
like an overclocked 600 watt eye 9 + 3
10 8 et eyes or 3 Vega 56 is with the
power mods on them and you've somehow
you plugged it into a dryer plug at that
point as you increase the heat load to
something like that more radiators will
help more but it's a you get diminishing
returns for the systems that are more
reasonable you get diminishing returns
anyway but yeah basically proportional
heat transfer rate to service area and
then as your liquid temperature versus
ambient approaches zero you basically
have no more room to grow so keep an eye
on that if you have a temperature sensor
in your liquid if you don't definitely
get one but if you have one pull that
number up hardware info 64 can off and
read them off of the motherboard headers
and then compare that to your ambient
temperature keeping in mind that your AC
control unit on the wall might have its
sensor somewhere else in the house so it
might not be 100% accurate but it's
probably pretty close then compare those
two numbers if you're getting near zero
probably stop adding stuff to the loop
because it's not gonna help you at that
point so that's all for this time as
always please leave more questions below
