to dig and paired them with some really
incredible stuff becoming yet seen on
our website I hope you enjoyed wow
that's amazing I wasn't expecting that
so good morning my name is zach carter
work for epic games i'm a tech artists
out there which essentially means that
my job is to play with Unreal Engine 4
all the time and play with all the cool
toys and features and then I get to show
it off to people this might mean I have
the coolest job ever but the jury still
out now showing curious how many of the
folks in the audience on our students oh
my god that's like all i should have
asked how many aren't okay how many of
you have been playing with Unreal Engine
4 already few of you ok ok so that you
haven't who has experience with you DK
or unreal engine 3 that's that's a large
chunk that's great ok let me hit a power
point I did not bring a power point I'm
not sure if I should apologize for that
instead we're actually going to be
taking a look at stuff right inside of
Unreal Engine 4 today and what I'm going
to do so we've got we have a time here
right so for the next 45 minutes or so
I'm going to give you guys kind of tools
then we'll show you some of the features
that are available in Unreal Engine 4
and some of the projects that we kept
they kept put together to help you learn
more about the engine to make you a
little bit more comfortable as you build
your game project then we're going to
take a little break because I've had a
whole lot of coffee and then once we
come back from that I'll show you guys
as some of the more advanced aspects of
the introduction one of my favorite
features which is blueprint our visual
scripting system you'll learn more about
that as we go forward so more started
wow I'm sorry real quick just refresh my
memory about half a dozen you've been
playing with Unreal Engine 4 are you
guys liking it so far that this can
totally be a little bit of an
interactive demo you guys are welcome to
ask questions get my attention if you
need me to go back over something I say
please feel free to just be friendly in
here it's totally fine if you heckle
there may be severe consequences whether
there may not be I'm not sure I decided
so what's that's good for starters is if
you guys just kind of a quick
introduction and overview to the user
interface foreign religion before this
is most helpful for those who have been
playing with you III obviously things
look a lot different now we have
completely redesigned our UI solution
for the editor tool say using a system
that we call slate so because you have
the source code to the entire engine you
also have access to slate so if you want
to start writing your own editor
interface pieces you can totally do that
for the first time ever it's very easy
to do so at a high level run for we have
I always feel obligated to mention then
you are across the top but really
whoever cares about the menu bar on any
application so we'll kind of gloss over
that I've got a toolbar here across the
very top of your interface with a lot of
things more important things are going
to do like saving or playing the game so
i just hit pledge of them and start
running around in my level and of course
this is a completely accurate
representation of what the game is going
to look like well set of access to
things like blueprints which i'll talk
about a little bit more later and we
have power to simulate the game which
means if i don't necessarily want to
play and i just want to see what the
game would do if I wasn't in it playing
on its own I could just simulate and
stay back here in the editor and still
move around playing new things now over
to the left hand side we have modes
panel the editor cannot be placed in a
variety of different modes to help you
get whatever job it is you're trying to
do done so for instance by default this
is in placement mode which allows me to
place objects into the map we'll do a
little bit miss later lot to do kind of
a live demo world build an environment
for but for instance I can bring in a
piece of geometry just by dragging
straight to replacement browser or
delete it when i'm done with of course
there's other things i can add it to i
can add things like lights or things
like trigger volumes basically anything
that is an inherent part to the engine
that I need to make my game it's all
available right here I had some other
modes as well we have the ability to
paint like new vertex painting right
here in the viewport we can work with
landscape so I need to make me
mountainous area is ringing them in
terrain I can do that as well we can
hang down foliage and we still have
geometry mode for those you who remember
playing with PSP brushes back in the day
quick heads up turn BSP is steadily
going away we're going to start calling
a geometry throughout today by call it
vs vfb more times please try not to rip
me too much i'm still trying to use good
so i jumping down a little bit we have
the content browser if you guys are
familiar with our religion 3 you
remember the content browser but it has
had quite a facelift now so we have a
list on the left that gives us access to
all of the folders and our project by
the way again this is just kind of for
the ue free people in the crowd we've
got away from packages now everything in
your unreal engine 4 project is its own
asset which makes transitioning your
asset from one project or the other
easier than ever because you don't have
to worry about those package
dependencies that you had to stress
about before so the the concept browser
is very easy to access highly filterable
so it's very easy for me to expand the
filters i'm looking for something like
materials i can just jump to whatever
full 15 minute filter by material and
here they all are you'll also notice a
few things like if you take a look at
the icons there in the content browser
we're getting real-time feedback so i
can see what things like that will look
like if they're animated
see the animation on them I can also
doing a live freedom preview of each
thing so if you take a look I've here at
the very bottom i have few options and
you'll see we have thumbnail edit mode
when i turn this on i can actually click
and rotate any object here in the
content browser so i can zoom then on it
i can check it out the men multiple
angles in the case of materials i can
swap out the object they're applied to
so if i want to see that on multiple
objects all without having to open it up
so i get fast access to that kind of
thing now that's also useful for things
like static meshes so if i want to take
a look at a mesh i can preview it right
here without having to bring it into the
into the world of course on the Diamonds
click on done editing and whatever I've
done will be saved as the new thumbnail
so it's also a way to kind of thumbnails
nicely arranged now we have the viewport
which is big it's beautiful it's also
allows you to see your world we're not
going to worry too much about that at
the moment because I could go on one's
about you how you navigate it and
whatnot but you'll see me do that and
it's not as much fun when you don't have
a computer in front of you play on the
right hand side we have the scene
outliner so I have any Maya people in
the room if I click off thank you so
much so usually like I asked that
question and most of us are really I've
never touched Maya but they use macs and
that's fine max has an equivalent as
well but I'm am I person from way back
so it kind of warms the
both of my heart so we have the scene
outliner actually this is just like the
outliner in mile this gives you a list
of all of the actors or objects that are
live in your game the currently exists
here level so you can give quick access
to search through them to group them
into folders if you like so very useful
thing and this will actually update live
as you play game so if you're spawning
things like Jeff dial bombs character
whatever that list will constantly
update keep track of what's going on in
your game in the lower right-hand corner
we have the details panel really this is
just a properties window so its context
sensitive as you select different things
it will update to show you the
properties or whatever it is you have
selected now that's just the parts of
the interface you can see for anybody
who has any experience with the Unreal
Engine really in any of its flavors you
know there's a lot of editors very
within it so for example if I take a
look at any of the materials I can
double click on one of them in the
content browser and that's going to
bring up our material editor which again
I like throwing out treats just for the
folks who've been playing with we can be
free in the past we have really
streamlined the material editor made it
a whole lot easier used and now it
finally moves from left to right don't
know why but that really excites me
because having agreed everything in the
opposite direction was always kind of
fun but now it's also easier than ever
to create nodes or your network so for
example you just drag an empty wire out
into space type out what you need and
not only does it come in but it's
already connected and ready for to use
so creating these materials is faster
than it's ever
for and there's plenty of other editors
to be had we're not going to necessarily
go over all of them what I'd like to do
real quick though now that you kind of
got a general idea of the interface I do
want to mention how accessible and how
customizable this interface is you've
already seen me grab a couple the
splitter bars and slides and stuff
around so obviously the interface is
very fluid but you can also grab any of
these tab panels you see and rip them
off float them however you want redock
them pretty much anywhere you need them
to be and it's the first time we've ever
been able to do that so you can
completely redesign the UI however you
you like to work which is super handy
once you get into multi-monitor setups
which i highly recommend you Dukes
working on one monitor even tried em
home it's a little awkward sometimes so
what next let's take a look at some
projects that we have made available to
folks who are just getting into the
engine so everything I'm about to show
you is completely available by our
marketplace looks you just come in feel
free to grab a seat you don't have to be
shy there's plenty of seating kind of
scattered around if you've already got
to see people are coming in please try
to make room for them to sit down so uh
one of those the projects I'd like to
show up the most probably is our content
examples project this is actually so
important that when you sign up for
Unreal Engine 4 we automatically q this
one for download because we want you to
have this so very badly
Oh God
so the content examples project is
really just a collection of levels that
we have put together to help showcase a
variety with features of Unreal Engine 4
so for example I'm going to go to file
and then choose open level and you see I
have this massive list of levels each
one showing off a different aspect so
let's grab something those are not kind
of simple we'll grab one over the
material properties right so pull open
this up so when you start editing a
material and actually something else I
can point out it's compiling the shaders
in the background it's going to do this
day's synchronous so I can still move
around I can still edit things in the
level and as soon as that's done then
everything will kind of clean up the
knowledge of those shaders will come in
we're also doing this with things like
building lighting so if you have
experience in Unreal Engine 3 for
instance if you have ever built lighting
traditionally what you had to do is
click build and then you walk away or
sometimes a few minutes for sometimes
significantly longer so we've done away
with that you can now start building
your lighting and as long as you're not
doing anything that invalidates your
lighting like moving meshes around you
can continue working so by all means
open up the material editor or work on a
particle system anything you need to do
we are as if it's like a double edged
sword some people get happy about this
other people groan we're working hard to
eliminate coffee breaks
so now that's all of those are compiled
take a look at any one of these
materials I'm going to select any of
these objects that you see here and
you'll notice over the details panel we
have access to all of its properties and
we have the materials that are applied
to it so I'm just going to double click
on the material right here in the
details panel and that opens it up here
in the material editor so what we're
looking at in this actual level is when
I select the main note in the base of
this material we have a series of
robberies we have things like the blend
mode the decal mode is like translucency
and the first time you look at this we
don't expect you to have any idea what
they do and you're probably available
what can I do to test them out do I need
to make a whole bunch materials and plug
stuff in well the truth is we've done it
all for you so as you go through the
content examples project by the way I'm
gonna hit G to go into game mode that
hides out any of the little actor in
icons we don't necessarily need to see
so here's this first stand just shows
off the blend mode property and the
different points you can use it so each
little item there shows you what that
setting is going to do and you can just
go stand by stand and see an example of
each property and how it should be used
so in this case this is pretty simple
right it's just taking a look at various
materials and you can if you want you
can grab each material you can open it
up see the settings that made it
possible and you can play with them and
make changes to them yourself if you
like any of these materials you can also
scrap them and use them in your own
projects that's faster than having to
create one on your own so obviously this
goes on and on because there are a lot
of different properties you can change
on materials so in this case we are
actually bypassing depth of field which
always throws me off
we go in there because I feel like my
contact lens slipped again so you can
see like we're outside everything looks
fine but as soon as deputy field hits
those materials on the rider bypassing
that in their remaining sharp I have
several different examples as well now
let's jump out of this level let's take
a look at some other things so moving on
to slightly more complex topics we have
examples of navigation mesh so here we
have a really simple character that it's
just moving back and forth in the level
and I can hit the P key and I can
actually visualize the navigation mesh
he's moving around it so we could see
how our characters kind of navigate
through here we have kind of a one-way
setup you see the little line there
means that you can run off this ledge
and hop off of it like so but that's a
one-way connection if you can't go back
up that so now he's going to navigate
back around the edge it's just showing
off new features of the nav system
and one that I like to show up probably
okay hang on I was going to show off the
cool stuff but for the sake of dramatic
effect will probably hold off on that
one c7 up there one more then we'll kind
of move on so here's an example of claw
which if I go ahead and see me like this
you see our apex cloth solution and
we've tried really hard to make these
examples as practical as we can so here
we have an actual rundown of the
different types of fabric you might want
to create so of course you see like
burlap sold rubber and so on so there
are the settings right there that you
would need to make that happen in your
own games and other examples of cloth on
static and skeletal meshes animation I
love that we actually have a pocket set
up I don't know why that excites me but
for me it's always the little things
right a demo of cloth collision
of course over here and I run away to
the end at the very end we have a little
playable character that you could
possess and run around and you can see
cloth on an in-game character out of
curiosity does anybody recognize this
guy yeah he's from Samaritan you call
alright so that's at a glance that's the
content examples project of course
there's a lot more levels in there and
we are working hard to release new
levels all the time in fact this latest
release we've got of you before this
coming up very soon is going to have
some new levels for you to open up and
play with now let's check out some of
the other projects we have to offer as
well so we also have games that you can
play because oh right as I've seen that
too right that's a like the story of my
life as soon as patience runs out we're
pretty much done so this is a game that
we actually put together just to help
show off how to build different types of
names I'm just gonna go to play this
live
but I suck at this game so okay
I'm going to teach you how to play you
jump over obstacles and you slide under
other obstacles
you
that's all there is to it it's just a
little platform running game to kind of
get you I get started with how to create
these types of games on your own and we
have a lot of these different projects
we're working on more all the time so so
we need to jump out of their open up
another project now there's another demo
that i'll be honest i'm usually a little
reluctant to show to me because i'm not
sure if folks are usually ready for this
level graphic fidelity so i'd like to
remind people to what you're about to
see is not pre-render this is actually
playing back live
I know try to remain calm if you can
revolutionary you've never seen a game
like this ever demos right always drink
demos now the great thing about this
example actually to kind of get on a
semi serious note is this was actually
created by one of our artists not by a
programmer it was created entirely using
blueprints which is our visual scripting
system that they went on burlington for
but those of you who are familiar with
unreligious three a little bit we had
kids mix which was a visual scripting
system is highly dependent on your
levels for Unreal Engine 4 we have
evolved that into something that is far
more robust and powerful so what I'm
going to do is show off the actual
blueprint that makes this game possible
it's all one signal visual script
and I'll admit there's a little bit
going on here good news is actually a
lot of this is actually not connected
right now so there's already support it
is set up and waiting to be connected
for things like leaderboards for
breaking ads put this on a mobile device
it's all kind of set up and ready for
you to go but to show you how easy it is
to manipulate a network you'll notice
there's already some comments here to
kind of help guide you around here we
have this section for the flapping so
this animates the upward movement on the
chicken whenever we cap and if we take a
look we got a timeline here they just
called flat up now timeline for those of
you who might have a little bit of
experience you eat three or four
essentially that's matinee light that is
a way to apply animation curves to an
object if we open this up there's
actually the curve that defines how the
bird is moving up and down it's really
all there is to it but this is x numeric
value of 500 many programmers in the
room just actually wow that's a pretty
big turnout of programming so when you
see a number that it's gonna punched
into a note like this that's essentially
the same thing is hard coding what I'm
going to do real quick yeah you so what
we've done we've taken the vertical
movement okay nobody could actually read
typos on the screen from here that's
fine so we takin the vertical movement
and we multiplied it by 500 I'm going to
turn that into a variable something
we've not going to change later and
let's name this variable something like
flat heights
and then I'm gonna make it public that
watch this really carefully i'm going to
kind of move the screen around a little
bit here now i have the blueprint for
this game selected and i'm going to
close off some of its properties all the
stuff that I don't necessarily want to
see let's select this variable that I've
created and let's put it into its own
property category let's call this
cheater and now when I compile check it
out over here in VIP from in the actual
details panel we have a new group of
properties called cheater with a
variable plat pipe so let's pull that
from 500 down to save 250 and then let's
just replay the game yeah awesome seven
minutes and now we have tapi chicken
with precision control exactly if you
actually the last so honest last time I
gave this device turned off collisions
and it everybody watch me go up to 63
you guys seem pretty cool so I won't do
that so again just to kind of reiterate
we have a lot of projects that we have
made freely available for you to
download dissect your welcome to pull
any elements from them into your own
projects if they'll help you the bottom
line is we want you to be successful
once you get your hands on these tools
and start using start making games now
this is something that we tend not to
stress but I mean for obvious reasons
but those are college students for the
most part I understand some of you so
that $19 bear i was in college once i
still remember vividly that nineteen
dollars a month I the first thing into
my to be like I'm already struggling to
buy Brahman right so we I do like to
mention that once you grab Unreal Engine
4 what you download is yours to keep and
it is not going to magically stop
working one day so if you are on the
fence you're not sure if you want to try
out Unreal Engine 4 or you're worried
about the investment in any way
whatsoever strongly encourage you just
to throw that $19 one time if you're
still worried about cancel for a while
the tools that you download the source
code that you download those are yours
to keep yours to keep developing with
I'm going to switch off when you're
ready once you feel like you understand
the tool well enough then you're welcome
to come back to resubscribe get the
latest version get all of the new
content that we make available because
that's what we're doing is wearing
centum izing these subscriptions by way
of adding new content adding new
features updating the engine but if
you're satisfied with what you get that
first month we encourage you to use it
get used to Unreal Engine 4 get a
project going get some funding is going
to jump on Kickstarter get things
rolling and then when you're ready let's
subscribe and let's make some some
awesome games
now all of that stuff out playing oh I
have some other cool pics a show of it
maybe we'll okay sorry you guys wanna
see some like cooler looking stuff yeah
yeah it's probably why you're here isn't
it that happens okay
who's here for the graphics see it's a
trick question I assume you're like
afraid to raise your hand you're like
well I'm here for the gameplay graphics
are cool too your unholy friends it's
here for blueprints a few of you that's
okay we're going to some cool think of a
blueprint if you weren't here for
blueprint before will be when you leave
I can convert you I can also load a
really high-end gorgeous matte
apparently so did you guys uh I guess
since it came out in GD CEO 23rd I can't
but it's already 2014 everybody gots to
the infiltrator demo right you've all
seen that maybe we could open them true
if you guys are up for this
first time okay so we'll come back to
that one may diverge just a little bit
so some of this up it i want to show we
might actually show after our break we
are kind of running close to the end of
my first session let this kind of
compile shader for just a moment and you
can pop back out here to the background
so what i want to do is give you kind of
a feature walkthrough to show you some
cool things that that the engine can do
show you how to build some environments
so to get started let's just build a
simple room will populate it with a few
assets and show how quickly and easily
we can do that sort of thing in Unreal
Engine 4 and in the background because I
am doing so many things at once pathetic
lemme help that one to stop
we're busy now thank you alright cool so
this starts to spin only a really simple
set and show how easily we can do des
I'm going to bring in a piece of
geometry from the placement browser just
a quick drag and drop and it appears and
that map I was trying to open where to
go completely jumps in now I had that
plan I intended to do that I'm glad
you're all impressed by that so this is
the beautiful interlude right we'll just
take a look at some pretty graphics this
is another showcase that we made
available to the public to showcase
particle effects in Unreal Engine 4 some
of the cool things you can do with them
so that's still compiling shaders and
it's a good idea to let it keep doing
that because I want you to get the full
impact of how beautiful that map is so
the meanwhile will do two things at once
and kind of like this because it does
kind of show off how lightweight and how
streamlined the engine has become we
have a really high-end map running over
in that other instance of the editor but
I'm still over here working in this one
and everything is going to work just
fine so let's take our little piece of
geometry just brought in and let's
resize it real quick by the way for
those of you who've been working in the
upper religion for a while this is the
SP you'll notice that I'm not having to
rebuild I am just quickly grabbing the
settings of the brush I'm changing them
around I can move it put it wherever I
wanted to be and I don't have to rebuild
the geometry everything is just updating
line in real time let's take this brush
I'll make a duplicate of it and we'll
set its brush type over to subtractive
so you can see it's carving out some
geometry will resize this to make it a
little bit smaller some spell Ryan and
then with the careful application of
snapping and not hitting the windows key
I will make this into a really simple to
waltz in
let's forget
sorry I'm like a precision that right
alright so we've got a really simple set
let's put a door in it so this negative
shape that I've got i'm just going to
really quickly do that off alltrack same
as it always was curious let's give this
some door like dimensions so an X will
say about 20 which is our wall thickness
by the way I don't know if you guys
obviously cannot see the numbers on
punching in so for a door we're going to
go 150 in width x 250 and the height
those you have no sense of of sizing
scaling me that's in centimeters so
we've officially moved on the real units
over 2 centimeters making it a lot
easier to gauge the size of all the
objects in your games oh and hit n just
slap that down with floor and sink that
into the back wall and flood it up we
get a little doorway here now let's make
this a little bit prettier I want to put
some brick material down on the walls
and I want to do it quickly so I'm just
going to grab one of the wall surfaces
and then run a quick algorithm to select
all the adjacent walls and over here in
the content browser I can just poke
around and find let's say this little
brick material here drag it onto one of
them and applies to everybody for the
floor we could grab a little wood floor
so let's rotate that 45 degrees because
you know that's stylish everybody likes
that sort of thing we'll put something
shiny up on the ceiling just to show off
some reflections and just like that we
have a very simple environment that we
created in just a few moments now let's
start populating this with some objects
so I've got what might be the most
stylish table and chair set ever
I'm so glad people laugh at them and I
told that joke at GDC if you were like
yeah now I also got a ceiling lamp to
bring in now this ceiling lamp was
created using blueprint which again is
our visual scripting system you've
already seen a little bit of that with
the amazing tapping chicken but that
means in this case is this is more than
just a match this is something that has
built up of a variety of components it
has matt has a light and it has some
scripted behavior to control how it
works so I can select it and I can
actually turn it on and it starts
illuminating the scene let's go into
game mode to get rid of the extra
details we don't need to see we can also
do some slightly fancier stuff too why I
can make a duplicate of it and change it
light tight to a floor lamp with a
single check box at the end key to slap
that down to the ground and now i have
the same asset twice in the level of
course doing two different jobs for the
door will just bring in a little door
match which somewhat alarmingly
conveniently fits right into that hood
like I've done this demo a couple of
times so with that let's go ahead and
just test this out so we'll play it from
the current camera position and I can
just walk around of course if it looks
great and the door just works because
this dork was also created using blue
printer back we can select it we can
open up its network and there you go
there's all the behavior that makes that
are open now it's a little bit more
complicated than your normal swinging
door but that's because it's actually
gauging why the players standing in
swimming two different directions okay
so now that we've built a little
environment let's go back to our
interlude just have to show you this
Matthew this is awesome so what I'm
going to do real quick so I'm going to
hit play and then we'll go full screen
on this this is still playing back in
the editor we just made the viewport
full screen
so that will just keep looping and of
course if you want you can fly around
this it's just a game environment that
you're welcome to explore there's a lot
of really fun and pretty things going on
here we have a lot of examples like this
this ship with the engine that you can
take apart also this is just information
for your HP to remember the elemental
demo we released couple years back very
soon that is going to be in your hands
if you want to take that apart clip as
well so let's jump back I go ahead and
close this now let's take a look at the
other features of the engine so here we
have so an example of several of our
materials so we have now moved on to a
physically-based material system so for
instance I instead of using things like
diffuse specular power but not we're
actually using real-world physical
terminology to define our materials so
here I have base color on the far left
and as I change that you can see the
color of the object changing we also
have roughness so just like in the real
world the more abroad for the rougher
surface is the less shiny it's going to
become so here are the very low
roughness value seats red glossy and as
we increase roughness that colossi just
blurs out and eventually obliterated we
can also control how Metallica services
so this surface well looks like shiny
gray plastic if we increase its metallic
parameter is you change over to chrome
doing just those three properties you
can really define a wide variety of
physical surfaces I'm going to kind of
shoot through these just for the sake of
time so we have kind of a security
camera example here we have some
materials where the actual material
itself is perturbative the vertices of
the match
so if I jump into wireframe mode you can
actually see the wireframe being
disrupted by the material here we have
an effect where we're taking the final
rendered image of the scene and we're
feeding that through material and I do
some change them to create kind of this
Tron style glowy effect
this example is just doing a white back
and forth between one of the many render
buffers that we use to draw each frame
so in this case we're looking at the
roughness bumper or how about these one
of these surfaces are we now also
separate objects or some separate
materials into material layers so here
we have four small rock at each one with
its own material type we have a movement
on chrome copper and red plastic and the
big rock in the back is actually using
all of them as individual layers and
placing them on the surface with pixel
accuracy and it's time to show this one
off too so here we have three different
types of us here we have ice wood and
metal and I can throw fire at them
and you see how they react one way or
crow water and you see they ramp an
entirely different way there's a lot of
power and animating and updating of
materials so I want to talk a little bit
about blueprints which I've mentioned a
few times throughout this demo
blueprints again on visual scripting
system now you've seen it at this point
to create entire games you saw me
Creed's or I had a little ceiling light
that has a blue cut behavior now we're
going to dig a little bit deeper into it
I'm going to simulate the games instead
of play and we'll select this little
bouncing ball and open up its blueprint
wrap this guy's graph is pretty simple
all we're saying is we have a little
time line which is essentially again
just an animation curve it is constantly
updating the location and the scale of
this all works i'll try to make the most
of my screen space here and notice as I
play the game that the wires that make
up this net network are actually
starting to illuminating glow you can
watch data move through a blueprint
network which is a powerful debugging
tool if you're not doing the behavior
you need watch those wires make sure
that what you want to have happen is
actually executing within your script
now also you limit it on each balance
this lower branch is firing and that's
creating a little wave ring effect you
see down there I'm going to right click
on this bottom most node I'm going to
add a breakpoint now all of my programs
they're going to know what a breakpoint
is so let's go ahead and add it in order
to see the next time that no gets hit it
pauses the game and jumps us right to
that location in the blueprint brat this
is a very powerful way to debug your
blueprint grasses if you're not getting
expected behavior you can set these
breakpoints up anywhere you meet them
and even if you don't have the blueprint
window open it's going to pause the game
open up the window and say
that thing you were looking for it just
fired that just happens now what you
want to do we can just step forward one
more execution if we want or if we're
satisfied we can just resume and keep on
playing we'll go ahead and remove that
and continue now of course that's kind
of a simple set up just for you doing
something like bouncing a ball up and
down you can also use blueprint to
create powerful level design tools so
here I have a simple metal rail but it's
actually a blueprint object with its own
procedural length so I can change a
property make that rail longer or
shorter and that length is independent
for each instance of the rail
and of course I need to do something
like rotated everything just works so
this way I can quickly build tools to
help my level designers get their jobs
done far more quickly blueprints can
also communicate with one another so
here I have free blueprints I have this
set of gears in the back a little button
and I have a light bulb if I hit play
and stand on the button the gears start
turning that's because the button has
been told to communicate with the gears
basically it's been set up in such a way
where the button looks at the gears goes
hey whatever you're supposed to do to do
it so I'll jump out of the game will
select the button and instead I'll tell
it to talk light bulb and now the next
time I play we get this amazingly
branded light bulb which I don't know if
you can see from there but i would love
to fill my house or my good and we knew
some more sophisticated things too so
you come over here and simulate and you
see if you got this little butterfly
flying around this butterfly has an AI
system created entirely wooden blueprint
I'm going to open that up and zoom out a
little bit because it's a little complex
now I don't have two monitors to show
this off but what's happening in the
background like actually on the screen
right now so here are little butterflies
recharging himself here in a moment he's
going to feel completely charged and
he's going to strike off in a new random
direction and fly around he'll avoid
obstacles eventually go get tired again
he'll land and you'll repeat the process
as he makes all of these decisions we
can actually watch the blueprint network
illuminate to show each thing so it's
kind of like having a window into his
brain or if you look at it another way
it's kind of like having a robotics
project that you can analyze in real
time
now you can also just do some fun things
with blue crane so here i have a little
kind of arcade machine i'm going to step
on the button in front of it and that
was created entirely in blueprint and
exists as a game literally within my
game so I jump in i start playing and i
only start that portion when i step on
the button now behind me i have this
little UFO sitting here looking all
human pretty and if i step on the button
in front of it I can take it over I get
a new camera I get new controls this
basil taking out control will pull me
back down wa SED will start moving me
around so these kind of hover style
controls and i can come over here and
float ominously over these little ones
disinfecting cows
oh it's it's so good well so all those
cows are physics objects so I can try to
pick them up and put them back in there
and the catch to this though is it's
harder than it looks because sometimes
house bounce I didn't know that before I
played this game we got those and the
cool thing is that all of everything you
see here this entire level that I've
showed up was actually created just by
two artists no programmers were needed
to help put this together so why don't
they just a sec and show you how
blueprint made this possible I'm going
to press the f10 key what that does is
that ejects me from the game's name is
actually continuing to play without me
I'm going to select our little UFO and
open up its blueprint graph now there
are several things going on here at
first just looks fairly simple in a way
it is so actually handling the motion
and what the other ship is doing is
pretty straightforward but then we have
this section called the sequences for
the abduction beam this is actually a
collapsed graph unto itself so if you
double-click this node and open up a
much larger graph of things that are
going on now if it looks a little scary
at first the other thing but to make
this happen there's a lot of stuff that
needs to take place and more you start
real the building games we're going to
see this kind of thing we have the
visual effect of the beam we have to
turn on and off we have to apply physics
to an object that we've dumped once we
make it to the ship we've got to store
whatever that object was then spit it
out later and then when we spit it out
we have to control what happens that's
four separate things and then we have
four networks to make each one of them
happy now to show that off to the
highest level of of accuracy and they
kind of show the cool things you can do
the interface I'm just going to take the
UI and rip it to pieces for just a
moment so let's take our network
hit Windows key right and we'll line
this up it's fairly well just enough to
see it now let's take our viewport so
the actual viewport for the editor is a
tabbed pedal just like everything else
we just hit the tab away let's rip that
off and we'll do windows left all right
looking good so far I think I still need
my toolbar just 27 so let's repossess
this guy for just a minute by the way
having two monitors the best thing ever
know just what I'm you throw that out as
an advert for dell monitors so now watch
this so as I just turned the beam on and
off you can see that uppermost Network
toggling on and on so those two wires
are switching now in the center those
are the second one down the wire is
trying to the code is trying to execute
but it's only making it so far because
it's not finding anything to pick up by
the way you'll hear me say there's a lot
of they talk about blueprint I'll say
the script or the code is trying to
execute but why am I saying that these
are nodes and connections right when you
work with blueprint you are actually
creating compiled scripts this is not a
network that has to constantly execute
during the game and slow you down kind
of the way kismet used to when you're
done you've actually created your visual
scripts those get compiled very much the
weight on the real script did back in
the day so now watch that second
sequence as I pick an object up
well you see the whole thing starts to
fire and then as soon as this got
attention to shift the third one will
execute so now we stored that object let
those stores you more so you can see
that and then when i spit something out
we can watch that fourth section execute
and the best part is that these are not
all just a bunch of individual or
disparate pieces everything is set up to
work seamlessly together we can take
just a second I'll reassemble my UI very
quickly don't really need the blueprint
window open anymore let's take my
viewport and put that roughly back where
it belongs I'm gonna play again let's go
ahead just go fullscreen on everything
so as I mentioned all of these pieces
are designed to just work together so
there's nothing really stopping me from
grabbing a couple of cows and then
returning back to my level play with the
butterflies or check out the Sun which
has magically changed now that I'm
piloting a spacecraft all the way back
to that environment that we built
earlier of course we can fly around
inside here take a look at all the
furniture we build and of course always
fun to blow things up right
did I get a roller is it gonna roll off
so close that's really the whole reason
I get this demo so now that you've seen
a selection of features available inside
of Unreal Engine 4 I want to show you
what a very small group of our folks at
ethnic ramble do with this is what I
must show you is the work of just three
guys who took a weekend bears on a game
team so they don't have a whole lot of
time to spare at the moment and they put
this together now once again this is
going to play live in the editor but i'm
going to go fullscreen just for a
slightly more cinematic event but it is
real time so we can take a look at my
ring or replacement
I'm pretty sure the moral of that story
is that once you become enough of a
badass to catch a knife from somebody
throws it at you do not pose with drop
the knife right so again that was just
the work of three of our guys they did
that over we can actually do their own
mocap in our studio what you saw there
is how they decide where they're going
to go to lunch every day so that really
is the end of my demo are there any
questions that i can answer from folks
yes sir
I'm a traditional what means I'll be
incorporating okay so yeah so the
question was how can you integrate my
code and blueprint together so we're so
that we're using a lot of epic is for
our programmers to create generic
classes to approach any given cats we're
and take a pic right but you can expose
aspects of that code in blueprint so
that somebody can go into the editor
they can instantiate that class and then
expand upon it in blueprint so in that
way the artist has I'm sorry the
programmer only has to create something
very simple with the appropriate hooks
for the artist to use and then the
artist can grab it and use blueprint to
turn it into whatever is they need any
other questions yes sir so that is
something that of course we would be
interested in if folks what no question
was this demo being as cinematic as it
is are we looking at on religion for is
being a solution that could be used in
movies and software innovations movies
or animations up we have a lot of people
who are using the engine in a wide
variety of ways not all of which I'm
allowed to talk about publicly the demo
level with the cave was all that like
the wall is everything made an editor so
the question was the effects cave with
all the particles was all of that made
an editor actually that cave is made out
of a single static mesh of a rock about
yay so big that is constantly just duped
it rotated and formed into a cave and
once that level is made public and it
will be you can totally take it apart in
fact I think there's only two different
types of rock in that entire project and
then just get duped and scaled and
rotated into whatever you need so you
overlap then intercourse with yes I see
anything else in the back
so right now we have a unreal front end
which is our solution for equitable
sorry my bad the question was what do we
have for solutions for getting out to
the different platforms that we support
essentially so we have the Unreal front
end which allows you to export out right
now in pc into mac android android and
iOS are supported the official output
for those is pc to android mac to iOS we
also have html5 support which is coming
it's our it's already in the engine
we're continuing to develop that we also
have oculus rift support there is no
time there is a subscription model does
not include consoles like ps4 and xbox
one however that's not really on us that
is Sony and Microsoft of course with
their licensing however if that's your
target that's what if you know you want
to make the next ps4 game or next Xbox
one game get your project starting
Unreal Engine 4 and then come talk to us
because we're more than willing if
you've got a project and it is up off
the ground and you know that's where you
want to go we want to work with me we
want you to be successful yes sir
how is a quality
it would be your question there is your
hardware and your load terms because I
mean again you're just you're processing
whatever you got into whenever html5
magic it's just a question of how like
all that has get processed down with the
pc so that it becomes hardware dependent
but if you're puttin anything out on the
web you generally want to target a lower
end as you've never really carefully
control but something's gonna open it up
yes sir
no so we don't have a script editor
actually the question was do we have a
script editor to allow for code editing
and surfing and repeat your question on
so the answer is no right now we do
everything through visual studio which
ties seamlessly into you before and if
you need to use the Express Edition that
works just fine as well so you can
actually open up classes code classes
directly from the editor and that will
launch visual studio for you and take
you right to whatever it is you need to
edit we also have a hot compiler so if
you change something going don't change
a number of properties for simple things
I'm changing a property value you can
actually compile that in the editor and
have the change take place live so when
demoing that what I tend to do is we'll
have like a gun with like a projectile
of some sort we can change the power
that projectile and tell it to compile
in the editor and then start playing the
game and we'll have our original value
and then as soon as the hot compilers
done some of my gun becomes more
powerful so some kind of semi limited
real time compiling a request over here
yeah how easy is it to move these loot
print objects between assets so like if
I playing in here I say hey I really
like that life it was easy to turn on
off and I want to stick that into a new
game how he's easy to just drag it out
of an existing project
it's approximately this easy to move
things around check out sir I have like
say we like this light and I want this
light to be in my next great game I just
need to right click on it and we have
migrated and this is going to tell me to
save so let's go ahead and make sure we
say stuff or X I don't need to save then
it's going to list off all of my
dependencies because that blueprint
object was a mentioned that was
materials all this other stuff so it
says here's all the stuff you have to
have to migrate that one asset you want
it you click OK you track down the
folder for your new project and you hit
okay that's it moves it over so we do a
lot of that actually which is why we had
to have that tool any other questions
yes at the back
so Scaleform is no longer in Unreal
Engine 4 we are we're taking out as much
of the third party software as we can
which if you think about it is exactly
why we're able to get the source code
out to people right so we don't have a
scale form solution at the moment we
have slate which is c++ orient right now
we have a goal in our working toward a
visual editor for slate and other plans
kind of on the line that we're working
on to make the UI integration much
easier for people to use but that's kind
of where we're at the mall folks I am
pretty much out of time so I'm going to
have to go ahead and wrap things up now
thank you all very much for attending
and please enjoy the rest of easy peasy</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
