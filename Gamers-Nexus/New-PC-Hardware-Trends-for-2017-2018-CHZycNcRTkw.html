would go crazy with RGB LEDs and
tempered glass but we never thought had
be to the extent that it is today
now that we've had a full year to watch
the industry get completely obsessed
with this trend we're revisiting new
trends in computer hardware in a post
coffee tax 2017 world RGB LEDs have now
gone a step further than previously but
companies are also starting to go crazy
over copper heatsinks hinged case panels
vertical GPU mounts curved and shaped
tempered glass and more before getting
to that this coverage is brought to you
by Corsairs new at t1 race chair which
is a $350 gaming targeted chair using a
bucket style race seat the chair arms
have four directional movement for
configuration to your liking and has a
bonus they use rollerblade wheels
learn more at the link in the
description below the first time to talk
about relates to cases as do the next
two we'll discuss this year we noticed a
more enhanced case doors than we've ever
seen before this was somewhat
popularized on the 760 t in 2014 and has
slowly sprawled outward since then this
year we saw hinge doors grow in
popularity as a way to improve case side
panel mounting the hinge doors that were
present on the Thermaltake v 91 TG which
fold out like suicide doors on a car on
the level 20 GT which uses 5 millimeter
glass panels on hinges the 40 pound
Corsair concept slate
the coolermaster H 500 p and the
Coolermaster C 700 p and all of these
cases are moving to hinge doors that
swing outward and can be easily removed
by lifting them up tempered glass is
also more frequently being shaped or
curved and bent for cases now which
increases cost but fits it well with the
hinged doors all of these a per mentions
cases use some form of tempered glass
with their hinged doors making for
something of a combo trend combo tray
and vertical GPU mounts are also big for
this year vertical GPA mounts are
featured in many of the previously
mentioned cases as well and are a
continuing trend of a further
commoditized PC hardware market that is
driven heavily by looks these days the
cases with vertical GPU mounts make them
optional for showcasing video
in the most part as there's little
functional gain from it some case
manufacturers like silverstone will use
odd form factor motherboards of ninety
degree Bend PCIe slots to eliminate the
need for riser cards
others use inverted layouts a good riser
cable like the common 3m solution has a
cost of twenty dollars from the
manufacturer alone that's cost that's
huge
it's rare to find a good riser cable
with these vertical orientations but
hopefully some of the manufacturers will
start making those purchases and
including them with their cases it feels
weird to be talking about airflow as a
trend in cases since it's sort of
something you need
but the final trend in cases this year
seems to be a light return and air flow
as a consideration by case manufacturers
almost sadly so the last two years it
seems like the entire industry moved to
closed off front panels but we're
starting to see some manufacturers
revert back to mesh front panels for
better airflow among these in Wynne who
have learned from their infinity and now
placed the 806 with wood paneling on a
list of cases that have more space
between the front panel and the chassis
for breathability we also see this trend
continued with the Silverstone cases
coming out this year at least some of
them thermal takes cases like the G 21
TG and some of Kuler masters cases where
they compensate by using a wider mesh
side intake and two 200 millimeter fans
in the H 500 P this of course means that
marketing materials can now boast
innovative intake designs even though
many of these designs were in vogue just
a few years ago that's really a typical
cycle just like phones where they go
bigger and then smaller and everyone
claims that it's the next big thing back
in the world of aesthetics Digital RG
B's are the next combo a trend merging
the past years RGB craze with highly
controllable LEDs the new digital RGB
LEDs can often accommodate seven bits of
color per channel using a PWM that
allows brightness and colors to be
fine-tuned through software or
pre-configured by the vendor the PWM
controllers also easy to deploy once
it's configured making this a more cost
friendly option than numerous RGB LED
controllers across the same board for
each strip of light Digital LEDs will be
prevalent on motherboards and video
this year at the show alone we saw
digital LEDs on nearly every gigabyte
motherboard on the asus motherboard and
also on MSI is 1080i Lightning card
which place them all over the back side
and permitted configuration via a
lighting center digital LEDs make for a
smoother transition between colors and
don't have the same hard edge as other
LED strips that we commonly see where
you can make out the individual bulb on
the strip the digital LEDs look more
like a smoothed out diffused color so
whether this is good or not really just
depends on taste but that is the next
major trend copper heat sinks are the
next major item hardware trends are all
about what marketing language that gets
you the most sales and it seems like the
marketers of the world have decided that
conference price is now affordable
enough to start using it as a badge of
honor these badges come shaped in fins
as companies like Lian Li and cryo reg
are now moving back to a world of copper
heat sinks typically we see copper for
the cold plates for its conduction
properties and then aluminium for the
fins which is cheaper lighter and it
doesn't really impact cooling in a
meaningful way in most situations copper
fins haven't been popular since almond
did it about ten years ago right before
the price of copper skyrocketed but it
looks like they're going to be making a
return on things other than just liquid
cooling radiators and so it's coming
back although it will no doubt offer
some benefit so this is largely a
marketing move under steady state
consumer conditions copper isn't going
to be that much cooler than aluminum
particularly considering the solder
joints are the weak link between them
anyway it might be one to to see cooler
between identical devices when at steady
state but that's about it
assuming it's tested properly ramp up
and ramp down speeds are slower with
copper because of its greater density
which helps with thermal consistency
when cooling components that experience
sudden temperature spikes this is
similar in behavior to a liquid cooling
radiator which can handle a high amount
of power throughput or wattage and heat
and soaks the temperature changes better
copper is also very expensive compared
to aluminum and given that it's more
limited in quantity and as much heavier
copper is mostly impacting the cooling
systems where there's more thermal mass
but for most consumer applications we're
dealing with parts that are often below
100 watts
so that difference is mostly going to be
felt in the Wallace Department not as
much in the performance Department
finally we also saw a trend in use of
international rectifier power components
on at least half of the motherboards at
the show including gigabytes entire
lineup and what is likely on their ex
399 board in addition to ax 299 boards
and the MSI is lineup for X 299 boards
the ir35 2:01 voltage controller appears
to be popular right now given its price
and capabilities as it can serve up to
eight total phases for the power design
this is often an eight plus zero or six
plus two configurations but the
versatility of the controller makes it
easy to buy in bulk and then configure
across a wide range of motherboards at
various prices this is often bundled
with IR three five five six fifty amp
hour stages that seem to be very popular
with Computex 2017 and we'll have more
info on all of these as build Zoids at
PCB breakdowns get uploaded to our
channel that recaps the major trends
from combi tax 2017 and those which will
largely define the industry over the
next year just like tempered glass and
