Nexus Don and we are back with forced
the cooperative action multiplayer arena
game and I'm going to show you the finer
mechanical elements with how combat
works how marking works and how our
spirit ball works for this tutorial or
an example we will be using the bow so I
will need to use this ability right here
which is called Chain Lightning I
believe and if we read it it says if you
shoot an arrow it will a Chain Lightning
arrow it will jump between Mars targets
within 3 meters of each other and it
will deal damage to each of those
creatures I don't know if there's a
maximum amount of marked creatures it
will deal damage too but basically you
mark things by shooting or hitting them
and that will put a white box above
their head they are now marked once they
are marked you can use your abilities
that interact with marked creature is
very similar to as I said previously D
in the fourth edition if you want to
make tabletop references there so the
reason this is cool is because if you
shoot as many swarmers or other enemies
as possible before they get get to you
you can then use chain lightning and it
will arc between all of them
hopefully killing them all at once if
you are lucky we will also be using
prefab elements like that spawner there
which I just deactivated but first let
me show you how the Chain Lightning
works so of course it'd be best to just
kill them but I need them close to each
other and then they'll are just like
that because they are both marked so
this thing I'll tell you how it works
you can put your spear ball down by
double-tapping space and then call it
either a single or double tap again and
that has now interacted with the object
which in this case is a spawner it is
now deactivated for a number of seconds
there are more advanced elements that
will appear right here and down there in
a few moments here they're probably
about 1 or 2 minutes and I will show you
how to interact with those as well and
why they are cool so I am marking
targets here by shooting them and then
we can do our chain lightning which arcs
and kills them both if you had three
targets it would do that to all three
and it will keep going down the line
until until they are out of range of
each other so we now have a brawler on
the field on the right side to believe
yeah there he is I'm gonna start marking
him early Chain Lightning of course
works best with multiple enemies but it
still does more damage than a normal
arrow you see it's only 9 and 10 down
here if we do a chain it does 55 takes
them out pretty quickly here are those
two elements that is for health we can
send the ball through it just like this
the ball now I've told it to follow me
it will heal wherever I am as long as
the green circle is around me we can
also use this thing that was close to
activate a shockwave thus maximizing the
marks on all of them and sending them
flying now I can make use of that
lightning ability and arkad between all
of them for max damage and they were max
marked as well so good news all around
there I should probably deactivate the
spawner quickly if I can make it to it
but it's gonna be tough but it is very
important that you deactivate those
regularly and now I need to get ready to
use this shockwave again because I will
be overwhelmed very rapidly especially
since I am an archer with with no real
reason to knock them back or ability I
should say once they are close got that
Chain Lightning again make sure you hit
you really don't want to miss with that
ability because it's a 10 second
cooldown I think and I wasted that sort
of but that's okay
these guys are mostly dead now so
hopefully I will be alright let's get a
mark on him zap all of them and now I'm
no longer getting swarmed like I was I
want to place the ball here just in case
I need it in an emergency I will be on
the bottom side I'll probably go heal in
a second okay got that deactivated I'm
gonna quickly disable this swarm er get
our spawner before it's too late
tell it to follow me and then we're
gonna go hit this thing over here I
believe this is the last wave so let's
pull that through now I'm gonna heal
while I have a quick second to do so
because I am pretty low health tell it
to follow me
we are gonna mark him a few more times
and then Chain Lightning once I get this
blocking ability off of them when
they're glowing yellow that means he has
activated and ability to to make them
block damage
put that in position in case I need it
and I'm just gonna kite him around and
use the Chain Lightning when possible
and well basically keep doing this until
he's dead I don't think Morse warmers
will spawn unless they spawn from the
top area but I think I can take him out
before that is reactivated for that
reason let's go ahead and use this
because there will be nothing else that
I will need to save it for take him out
with a lightning bolt and we are done
success that was much better than the
first playthrough because I I wasn't
looked at those more advanced mechanics
pretty cool stuff I think personally and
you can see we've now unlocked a passive
skill for the bow which is over here and
that skill let's see what that does
right click on it hitting the wound
Foley is stretched arrows deal an extra
two damage per mark so fully stretched
of course meaning when you draw the bow
back go back all the way and get the
yellow arrow so pretty cool stuff there
hopefully that helps you see some of the
more detailed mechanics of forced since
my first video didn't quite do that
justice and if you want to know more
check in the description below for a
full article preview on forced as well
as the original video and I will see you
guys next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
