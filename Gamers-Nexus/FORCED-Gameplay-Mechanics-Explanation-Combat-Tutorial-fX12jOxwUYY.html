nexus 10 we are back with forced the
cooperative action multiplayer arena
game and i'm going to show you the finer
mechanical elements with how combat
works how marking words and how our
spirit about works for this tutorial or
a example we will be using the bow so i
will need to use this ability right here
which is called Chain Lightning I
believe and if we read it it says if you
shoot an arrow it will a chain lightning
arrow it will jump between March targets
within 3 meters of each other and it
will deal damage to each of those
creatures I don't know if there is a
maximum amount of marked creatures that
will deal damage to but basically you
mark things by shooting or hitting them
and that will put a white box above
their head they are now marked once they
are marked you can use your abilities
that interact with marked creature is
very similar to as I said previously d
in the 4th edition if you want to make
tabletop references there so the reason
this is cool is because of each shoot as
many swarmers or other enemies as
possible before they get get to you you
can then use chain lightning and it will
arc between all of them hopefully
killing them all at once if you are
lucky we will also be using prefab
elements like that spawner there which I
just deactivated but first let me show
you how the chain lightning works so of
course it'd be best to just kill them
but I need them close to each other and
then they'll are just like that because
they were both marked so this thing I'll
tell you how it works you can put your
spear ball down by double tapping space
and then call it either single or double
tap again and that has now interacted
with the object which in this case is a
spawner it is now deactivated for a
number of seconds there are more
advanced elements that will appear right
here and down there in a few moments
here we're probably about one or two
minutes and i will show you how to
interact with those as well and why they
are cool so i am marking targets here by
shooting them and then we can do our
chain lightning which arcs and kills
them both if you had three targets it
would do that to all three and it will
keep going down the line until until
they are out of range of each other so
we now have a brawler on the field on
the right side of believe yep there he
is I
going to start marking him early Chain
Lightning of course works best with
multiple enemies but it still does more
damage than the normal arrow you see
it's only nine and ten down here if we
do a chain it does 55 take them out
pretty quickly here are those two
elements that is for health we can send
the ball through it just like this the
ball now I've told it to follow me it
will heal wherever I am as long as the
green circle is around me we can also
use this thing that was close to
activate a shockwave thus maximizing the
marks on all of them and sending them
flying now I can make use of that
lightning ability and argued between all
of them for max damage and they were max
marked as well so good news all around
there I should probably deactivate the
spawner quickly if I can make it to it
but it's going to be tough but it is
very important that you deactivate those
regularly and now I need to get ready to
use the shock wave again because I will
be overwhelmed very rapidly especially
since I am an archer with with no real
reason to knock them back or ability i
should say once they are closed got that
chain lightning again make sure you hit
you really don't want to miss with that
ability because it's a 10 second
cooldown i think and i wasted that sort
of but that's okay these guys are mostly
dead now so hopefully i will be all
right let's get a mark on him zap all of
them and now I'm no longer getting
swarmed like I was I want to place the
ball here just in case I need it in an
emergency i will be on the bottom side
i'll probably go heal in a second ok got
that deactivated gonna quickly disable
this swarmer get our spawner before it's
too late tell it to follow me and then
we're going to go hit this thing over
here I believe this is the last wave so
let's pull that through now I'm going to
heal while I have a quick second to do
so because I am pretty low health tell
it to follow me we are going to mark him
a few more times and then chain
lightning once I get this blocking
ability off of them when they're glowing
yellow that means he has activated and
ability to make them block damage put
that in position in case I need it and
i'm just going to kite him around and
use the chain lightning when possible
and well basically keep doing this until
he's dead I don't think more swarmers
will spawn unless they spawn from the
top area but I think I can take him out
before that is reactivated for that
reason let's go ahead and use this
because there will be nothing else that
I will need to save it for take him out
with a lightning bolt and we are done
success that was much better than the
first playthrough because I I wasn't
looked at those more advanced mechanics
pretty cool stuff I think personally and
you can see we've now unlocked a passive
skill for the bow which is over here and
that skill let's see what that does
right click on it hitting the wound
folia stretched arrows deal an extra 2
damage per mark so fully stretched of
course meaning when you draw the ball
back go back all the way and get the
yellow arrow so pretty cool stuff there
hopefully that helps you see some of the
more detailed mechanics of forced since
my first video didn't quite do that
justice and if you want to know more
check in the description below for a
full article preview unforced as well as
the original video and I will see you
guys next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
