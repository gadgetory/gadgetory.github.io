raked in money for making a Nintendo
classic and so they made the ps1 classic
we're gonna take it apart today didn't
come with a power cable and I don't have
a phone charger here so we're gonna take
it apart instead of playing it and this
is well it's called the SCP H 1000 R and
it is the ps1 remade into a box that is
lighter than my phone so that's gonna be
some quality parts in there but to be
fair how much do you really need to play
24 year old games so this thing runs the
pcs X emulator officially it runs the
pcs X rearmed emulator which is a
modified version of the pcs X reloaded
emulator for ARM processors which is a
modified version of PCs X so it's it's
got an emulator on it it's probably
running an ARM processor give them a
name we're going to take it apart and
see if we can identify the components
what they do and how good the build
quality is of this this thing before
that this video is brought to you by
EVGA SRT X 20 atti XE ultra video card
we recently use this to beat our
founders edition overclocking results
with its additional power target
headroom and cooling capabilities the XE
Ultra uses a 2.7 extra thick heatsink
for a quiet operation under low loads
but also maintains higher clocks on
average over the FE model learn more at
the link in the description below
first up the notes here we're gonna take
this one apart today and then we're
gonna do a separate teardown of an
original ps1 controller that we bought
used but the good news is it's so old
that all of the bacteria on here is
probably dead by now
we're gonna take this apart and this
apart and look at the two and see how
accurate the PSone classics version of
the original ps1 non DualShock
controller is so we have one of each
year so we're gonna do that and you
would be not at all surprised at how
cheap those are these days so we're
gonna do this one today and first of all
I should note that by today's standards
to obviously to produce the quality of
game at ps1 runs you really don't need
much you definitely don't need this much
surface area for your parts I mean any
modern phone is even more powerful than
this
that is evidenced by the price tag of
nothing else and so you don't need much
which means that if we kind of tap on
this you'll hear that it is pretty much
hollow all the way through so it's fine
I could be a whole lot in there for us
to look at but also first thing I did
was try and start taking this thing out
looks only parallel i/o port and
apparently this is a thing that happened
even on a an updated version of the
original ps1 when they took away the i/o
port and replace it with plastic so that
doesn't come out but if we look over the
fin first your disc replica doesn't
actually run them memory card slots that
don't have memory cards but it's all
just for the looks right it's all for
for posterity and then USB controllers
which is actually much appreciated
especially being plug them into a
computer or something and that's really
all there is to it
not much venting or ventilation here at
all this is all fake so that's all just
embellishments and you can see the metal
through here so technically convinced a
bit but it's not really gonna get hot so
let's take it apart
we have Philips size zero screws to
start with and there's gonna be one two
three four five that are revealed and
then sometimes they like to hide one
under these stickers or under these feet
so we'll see if we can if we can find
them all easily this is a pretty easy
component to take apart but I'll track
the screws on arm out honor our mod mat
anyway which has a video card diagram on
it same idea there you can get one at
store dock here in Texas net if you do
like what you see just for screw
tracking although this is five so pretty
easy
our last two console nice bunch of
plastic came out with it our last two
console tear downs were the Nintendo
switch the joy con controller teardown
which was after that and the Xbox one X
teardown so today like I said we're
gonna do this one first and then after
we're done with this one we'll have a
separate video on the controllers
comparing the old to new
was trivial hey I have an idea let's put
holes in the bottom for ventilation and
then obstruct them with a film I mean
again it's high it's not really
generating any heat so who cares I guess
I mean it's it's pulling less wattage
than a phone does when it's under load
so you got to kind of keep that
perspective underside here the first
thing that's revealed is not much
it's a custom-fit PCB it does in fact
take up most of the surface area you got
a big block here that's not used but
they're not gonna make it device shaped
like that
so the PCB itself only has a couple of
kind of standard caps you find these on
everything video cards motherboards so
small caps smaller caps some small SMDs
and this PCB is like it's labeled side B
and then it's also LM 11 and I don't
know if this is probably a PCB model
number but LM 11 and then 94 o to O 11
Sony interactive entertainment
incorporated some solder joints on here
so these are just solder joints
where they attached the i/o and the
charging ports let's get to the other
side that's where the interesting stuff
is so if you took your own apart for
some reason just be advised that the
screw sizes are different they're
smaller on the inside you just tear down
possible I guess we want to apply
separate this and it is probably secured
by thermal pad
so let's go there what's holding us down
throne pad thick thermal pad connecting
to an appropriately sized albeit and
pathetic by our standards but for this
kind of device again the amount of heat
you're dissipating is just irrelevant it
barely shows up anywhere so there's your
heat sink no active cooling does not
need it which is ultimately a positive
and for the components that's where we
can kind of start looking at stuff the
shell is an ABS plastic and that's for
this outer shell that's an ABS plastic
for the inner components these are
switches these are switches so where do
those which buttons do those so you can
see power button right there so power
button reset button open button which I
believe is used for the game switching
or something like that how empowered
Anya let's get rid of the throne pad
this toolkit we're using is just from
our iFixit pro tect toolkit and I will
link that below if you're interested in
that so there's a throttle pad how thick
is that that would be useful information
if you needed this is the kind of thing
I could see drying up in a couple of
years and needing to be replaced so if
you had issues with shut down thermal
shut down so we can at least figure out
the thickness of this thing it's a 2
millimeter if they don't that roughly
any tighter and I'm going to rip it so
that's about two millimeters so over
here we have a samsung flash module so
there's gonna be NAND based memory says
you're emmc NAND flash and we'll talk
about this part moment as well these two
modules right here these are ddr3
modules and we have two of those so this
pad can come off but it's not hiding
anything there's no reason to remove it
that's just for mounting pressure to fit
everything cleanly
the parks in more depth starting with
the two most important ones the SOC is a
mediatek mt6752 I co Nia the CPU is a
64-bit quad-core whose memory controller
can communicate with ddr3 lpddr3 and
ddr4 we can show an a 35 block diagram
from arm to better illustrate the
architecture at a top level though if
you need a refresher on that the CPU
proper is an 8 35 cortex at 1.5
gigahertz although we don't know if Sony
has made any modifications to there's
the a 35 is arms smallest processor
design and as an efficiency focused
low-power chip that has an FPU on each
core of which there or four of those and
that's along side blocks of d cache and
I cache their shared l2 cache for all
cores and although ECC is optional it
probably is not used in the ps1 and this
is clearly not powerful by modern
standards keep in mind that the original
ps1 used a thirty three point nine
megahertz 32-bit processor our ASC
processor by LSI and that company has
since been bought and sold multiple
parent companies in the last couple of
years even this SOC is working with
power VR as GE 8300 IGP which is capable
of about 32 FP thirty-two flops per
clock also not that powerful but the
original ps1 had a max resolution of 640
by 480 and a flat shading poly
throughput of 360,000 polygons per
second actually isn't bad but it goes
down to a 180,000 Poly's per second when
you text your map them and it goes down
to 90,000 when you add lighting to the
texture mapping and shading this worked
alongside a geometry coprocessor for the
original ps1 for vector math and matrix
multiplies it also had two kilobytes 2
KB of texture cache that operated at 132
megabytes per second on on the memory
bus which was 32 bits so it's a 32 bit
wide memory interface 132 megabytes per
second just just for perspective modern
memory interfaces are in the hundreds of
gigabytes per second as for the and
that's for something like a high-end GP
as to the emmc that's Samsung's and it's
the KLM a g1j ETD of - be zero for one
we got a hold of the datasheet for this
one and we found that its density is 16
gigabytes there's one of these modules
on the board
unfortunately pricing was difficult to
get because it's an AOL part so while we
found prices they were all hyper
inflated due to the lack of availability
and Sony certainly got better prices
than we could find online so it's not
even worth listing the prices we found
just they're not accurate at all next
the ddr3 is Samsung's k4b 4G one six
four six e - B yma which is an 1866
magnet per second for gigabit memory
solution organized an 8 by 512 clusters
and offering that 1.3 5 volts these seem
to cost about 10 cents each for a few
thousand units but pricing again is
difficult to ascertain because these
chips to REO l for reference the
original ps1 used 2 megabytes of RAM and
one megabyte of video ram that covers
the PCB and all the components in depth
and then finally the shell here is
pretty straightforward ABS plastic you
can see the almost cherry style plus
sign for the actuated switch all that
does is push down on the gold switch
that you see right here you can push it
with your finger to it and it's just a
spring button that's that is all there
is to the plastic shell there's nothing
else special about that underside it's
just an underside and then some metal
sheets too that are on actually attach
the plastic not to on to the a clear
sheet of plastic rather than the casing
so that's just to cover up the holes I
don't know if that's probably more for
the looks than anything because
thermally it shouldn't really matter all
that much
that's the ps1 classic so the sum of its
sum of its parts isn't particularly high
I mean those components are mostly eol
so Sony probably got them from supplier
he just had a ton of them left over
trying to get rid of them or already had
a bunch on their own
as a product we always don't have any
opinions yet on how good of a gaming
experience it is if you wanted to
revisit stuff we do have content coming
up on that so we will be soon talking
about the value of this it's kind of
kind of really minimizing when when
you're holding up this and knowing that
you could actually just use this to play
the games I don't need to reassemble it
you can just plug it in and it would
work fine so this we will be revisiting
is it worth buying one of these and
playing the old games on it or going
some other route so make sure you're
subscribed for that but otherwise some
of the parts they're not expensive sony
has some pretty good margin here
especially because it does seem like a
rather hacked together last-minute
project they could have done a lot of
really cool things with this and we'll
talk about all of that in a separate
video so that's it for the teardown
though so next we need to do is
subscribe check back for the controller
disassembly and comparison against the
original so we're going to look for and
this one it's a it's more of a feel test
as a mechanical thing so from a human
factors standpoint how well have they
replicated the feel of using the old
original controller with these replicas
because that is an important
characteristic for any kind of retro
console remake and that'll be it for
this one so subscribe as always for more
store documents access net to pick up a
mod mat like the one we used in this
video or the shirt that I'm wearing now
except not literally this one and I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
