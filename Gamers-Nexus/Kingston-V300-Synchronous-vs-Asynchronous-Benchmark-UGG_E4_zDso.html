nexus dotnet and today we're
benchmarking kingston's v300 against
itself there's been a bit of a stir in
the tech community lately after reports
a few months ago that users were seen
significantly lower benchmark scores
with their ssdnow v300 than the ones
reviewed by the press and and some of
the initial models of course it was
largely understood that the performance
difference is a result of Kingston
silently switching to microns 20
nanometer asynchronous NAND from their
original models 19 nanometer toggle mode
synchronous mend from Toshiba the
important part being the synchronous bit
vs. asynchronous so just to be clear the
current model is asynchronous and the
model that is no longer shipping that
was originally tested was using
synchronous NAND I wasn't satisfied with
the user test out there since they
primarily rely on incompressible
benchmarks like a SSD and and so I built
a trace based real-world test to
accompany a suite of synthetic
benchmarks to test the claims that the
performance dropped fol disclaimer this
video is going to be a bit shorter than
normally because I have a flight in a
couple of hours for GDC and gtc so my
apologies hit the link in the
description below for the full article
that goes in full detail on what all
this synchronous where it's asynchronous
stuff means the objective of this
experiment was to investigate the
performance differences between
asynchronous and synchronous and Nan as
it pertains to Kingston's v300 SSD the
switch happened entirely for cost and
supply reasons and is the sole reason
that the v300 is currently available for
about seventy to eighty dollars these
days for a 120 gigabyte model anyway
let's briefly talk about the two types
of NAND used the difference between
synchronous and asynchronous an end
largely stems from the way the timing
circuit prompts data transmission in
this graphic by Samsung we can see that
the timing circuit used for this
particular asynchronous nanded design is
prompting a read event that's re signal
on the fall of each signal wave the
synchronous NAND
ever sends its signal on the rise and
fall of each signal wave so about two
times as often and produces almost a 2x
difference on paper so with SSDs on
paper is very rarely translated to real
world because the way controllers work
and operating systems work and all the
overhead in between but that's what
we're testing this is sort of like the
difference between an asynchronous
stopwatch that you can stop with a
button and asynchronous or continuous
wall clock in theory asynchronous NAND
should see the biggest drawbacks and
sequential and incompressible actions
you can read about the methodology below
but we're just going to dive straight
into benchmarks because I want borrowed
time for that GDC flight so the devices
were preconditioned for each type of
task before testing initiated first of
all starting with my in-house test suite
we can see that the windows 7 boot time
differences we're totally unnoticeable
and within margin of error you can
ignore them the winrar extraction and
compression differences were pretty note
as well fifteen percent in the case of
compression and that's going to be the
very few users will do a lot of
compression or extraction on a daily
basis if you do you know who you are
great for the handbrake transcoding
process we saw absolutely zero
difference primarily because this test
is more bound by the cpu and ram than
storage for this test i used largely
incompressible data that was ten point 3
gigabytes in total size the data
consisted of several hundred songs and a
couple of large video files all in mp3
mp4 and avi formats because this data is
already heavily compressed by the nature
of the formats the SSD considers it to
be largely incompressible data and will
thus perform slower by the nature of the
sandforce controller we see a massive
51.7 percent difference between the old
v300 that's no longer available and the
current v300 so that's pretty that's
pretty big you're going to notice that
if you're moving a lot of files around
but as for how many users move enough
files to notice on a regular basis
I will talk about that in a moment for
premier encoding there's about a six
percent delta which is sizable for
anyone spending 20 hours a day rendering
but outside of that it's really not
noticeable and moving on to a forty six
percent incompressible benchmark or
rather forty-six percent compressed data
benchmark using anvils storage utilities
we see that asynchronous the
asynchronous be 300 that I'm calling to
be 300 a suffers hard in sequential
operations and operations of a high-q
depth but seems to do fine and lo q
depth operations so that's sort of
expected now as a user you're going to
be mostly using 4k random operations and
even 1k random operations almost
entirely at a queue depth of one or two
for most actions and you'll occasionally
peak at four depending on what you're
doing most games that I've done trace
testing in our 1k queue depth one so
that's kind of what you're interested in
if you're gaming but keep in mind the
performance is already so high on both
of these drives for things like gaming
you're really not going to notice a
difference in your load time or anything
like that it's Italy fractions of a
second for most gains so do keep that in
mind finally we have some iometer tests
I have these full tests on the website
of course and it's really just showing
more of the same for anvil it's showing
our one KQ depth one bench that I talked
about and again we see huge differences
with the higher queue depth but for for
the lower stuff q1 q2 at four it's
somewhat unnoticeable for the average
user so the conclusion here or the
question rather for the conclusion is is
the new v300 actually worth buying with
all of these changes is the asynchronous
land of so detrimental that you should
no longer be buying it the short answer
as always is it depends if you are a
power user if you're doing compression
and file transfers and rendering and
stuff that I do for the website like all
these videos you should absolutely care
because
those that fifty percent difference in a
file transfer for large media files when
you're dealing with a hundred gigabytes
of media files that's a big deal and the
same goes for our rendering a six
percent Delta for one video a day is not
going to be noticeable when you're
rendering 20 hours a day that can be
huge that can be an extra video you can
put out that day so that's sort of where
you want to go towards Kingston's own a
hyperx actually which is within spitting
distance of the v300 it's ten five or
ten dollars more and it uses synchronous
and and it's a bit bit faster and by a
bit I mean a lot faster so that's that's
sort of where I would push most power
users and users who can identify with my
own usage patterns because for ten
dollars you get something that will make
you a bit happier when you're producing
content for the average user who's
trying to find an SSD to stick in their
laptop to boot a little faster and the
load applications a little faster you're
probably going to be fine with the p300
the other option right now I guess is
the m500 is about the same price I
haven't tested that one so I can't
recommend it but at the seventy or
eighty dollar price point of a 120
gigabyte we hunted it's perfectly fine
for everyday actions you're not going to
notice those differences all that much
and for the most part you're going to be
doing compressible file transactions
because that's what your OS does that's
what all your log files do that's what
your browser does when it's caching data
that's what a lot of saves and other
document based applications will do
gaming does deal with a lot of
incompressible stuff and media is a lot
of incompressible stuff but you're still
sitting in the forty-six percent
compressible data range so my conclusion
I guess then is that if you are a main
stream user who's sticking this in a
laptop or a desktop that's doing office
applications you shouldn't get too hung
up on this if you are a power user you
should probably care and do more
research if you're just gaming will say
quote just a gamer and you're not doing
a lot of content creation then once
again not a huge impact
you shouldn't get too hung up on this
but for ten dollars more I would push
you all day long toward the HyperX
except if you're on an ultra budget if
you're building one of our cheap bastard
systems you might as well just save the
ten bucks I guess and get the v300 if
that so pleases you if you can't fit a
ten dollar more drive in your budget
which is totally reasonable so that's
where I stand on it please check the
article for full details and i will see
you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
