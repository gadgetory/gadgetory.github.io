Patrick posted a few days ago this is
basically a research piece so mainly
we're looking at some quick and dirty
testing on Ryze and CPUs we normally use
these types of tests for internal
reasons like planning and test execution
don't really publish them because
they're just used to fuel the actual
testing that does get published that
said Rison and the Zen architecture are
still young so we're going to be
publishing this data just to kind of get
some more information out there there's
not really a huge conclusion at the end
of this it's just data for the sake of
data and learning how Rison works before
getting to that this coverage is brought
to you by Thermaltake and their contact
silent 12 which is a $25 air cooler that
supports am for mounting you can find a
link in the description below if you are
looking for a quiet and affordable
option for cooling your cpu so the tests
included here if you've already read the
article I'll save you the time it's the
same information if not stay tuned
because we're looking at things like
balanced versus performance and the
impact of those power settings within
Windows on frame rate so that would be
the high performance versus the balanced
state I'm sure you've heard about that
for rise and testing we'll be looking at
that impact on frame rate we're also
looking at boosting and XF our
performance in those power modes and how
they change functionality based on which
power mode it's in we'll be looking at
the impact of EFI versions on fps and
the impact of two different motherboards
on fps ultimately we found that our
decision with the Asus board to use five
seven zero four which at the time was
the newest bios anyway was the best at
the time for benchmarking given our
options but this does expand some
understanding of how the gigabyte board
performs and that board receives a few
days later so haven't had nearly as much
time with it but we've had enough time
to run a few tests of the review week
EFI options that were out there on the
gigabyte X 370 gaming gaming 5 and the
Asus crosshair 6 hero board which is
also next 370 board let's start with the
efi and motherboard differences
mind again that this is entirely a
research piece these numbers are not
fully inclusive of all performance
expectations on all tested platforms
that's why we normally keep this
internal but the stuff we're looking at
today provides a better foundation to
help everyone including our own team
better understand Ryan's behavior just
before we publish the article we
received efi updates from both aces &amp;amp;
gigabyte the test and was already done
so neither were included in this piece
because the pace is so fast right now
once things slowed down and the
motherboard manufacturers stopped
releasing basically beta updates will
visit the topic again with the newest
efi whatever it is at a time for now the
purpose is to look at initial
performance during review time with the
review time efi versions we use the HTS
crosshair for our reviews with efi at
five seven zero four for all initial
testing at the time that was the newest
despite AMD at shipping the motherboard
with an older efi that was built for unn
finalized microcode on Rison we got this
version by working with asus directly if
anyone tested with the version that AMD
shipped it was an older version of efi
that could have impacted performance
since then asus has released another efi
beta version that makes some do CP
tweaks we haven't yet tested that
version but we'll grab the next stable
release anyway here's a look at the
frame rates when using the a cs5 704 efi
provided during launch and the gigabyte
F 3 and F 3 n versions of efi that were
available during review week we now also
have a version f5 but again we're
waiting for the next Rev to test the
current plan is to skip a revert to
given the high frequency of releases and
look at the other stuff with watchdogs -
we're seeing the five 7:04 asus board
marginally edged out the gigabyte f3 and
efi version where we move from 84.3 280
3.7 FPS average and 80 2.3 FPS average
for the other efi version 5 7:04 it
generally seems superior here when
looking at averages and lows but the
difference is negligible overall
certainly not something you would see
but definitely something that's
measurable and that is also important to
include because that's what we see on
the charts this is not a huge jump in
performance board to board when looking
at the release weak efi versions we need
to include msi for a fuller picture but
haven't looked at those boards yet we
have heard of bigger performance changes
though between MSI's initial EFI revs
and the stuff that came out closer to
launch despite these sort of boring
results it doesn't mean that the EFI
version is useless we've heard from some
folks that they got stuck on twenty six
sixty six to twenty eight hundred
megahertz on the gigabyte motherboard
and know that the later EFI revisions
theoretically helped improve this though
our particular configuration seems
permitting of at least twenty nine
thirty three that's not true for
everyone this is partly due to
differences in Sam's on a rev and Hynix
dies on the memory modules the
performance differences between the
gigabyte and asus boards were
up-and-down but overall they reinforced
our than only choice of the Asus board
for initial testing from a 16 gigabyte
ashes of the singularity has about a 1.2
percent drop watchdog's to 0.7 percent
and total war Warhammer decreased about
1.5 percent in average FPS on the
gigabyte board and the favorite
Cinebench dropped 5.7 percent in
multi-threaded performance on gigabytes
board after averaging 6 passes for the
synthetic benchmark normal variants in
tests can account for some of the
differences but the logical conclusion
is that differences in hardware and
software can cause repeatable
differences in benchmark results this is
good news for consumers if there's
repeatable variance or unreliability
between platforms right now in our tests
it would imply that there's some room
for optimization and improvement this
also means that our test results should
only be 100% directly compared against
our other test results because
benchmarks on other platforms will show
different outcomes even using the same
CPU memory support has a tremendous
impact on this from what we've read and
so testers or users incapable of
exceeding 20 666 megahertz may be more
affected by that quirk than anything
else
grabbing relevant efi updates for memory
support should help the mr guard though
and most the vendors have pushed updates
for do CP or XMP equivalents now that
said keep in mind that gains are limited
by the confines of reality while we can
anticipate improvement in performance
via efi or motherboard changes these
initial results that do indicate that
they are limited at least for these
initial efi versions expect nothing and
you'll be best off performance gains it
won't be enough to get the 1700
7700 K levels in gaming performance for
instance especially not with the 1080p
testing that we encourage there will
likely be improvement but not on scales
that large so keep the expectations
checked or just wait for more benchmarks
before forming honey let's move on to a
stopgap measure to increase performance
in Windows and that would be changing
from the default balanced power mode to
high performance mode this is one that
was recommended by AMD though we did
test with high performance throughout
all of our reviews before they even
contacted us so that was covered on our
end but we wanted to look back and see
what actually changes if he's do switch
to the not recommended balanced mode a
few things to note here first of all
there can be some FPS difference we'll
go through that but also performance is
not really ideal because it does force
the clock to basically run at full tilt
the whole time so not great for power it
is wasteful in power it leaves less room
for voltage and frequency modulation for
example in XFR when you're using one
core one thread something like that some
really light tasks in terms of threading
XFR is less capable to hit and sustain
those higher frequencies in these short
periods of time provided when running
already at basically maximum voltage
we'll look at that through these results
for some quick numbers Metro last light
shows no real difference between average
frame rates with the configurations
tested we see both at around 124 FPS
average and that's within range of
variants the 1% and 0.1% low values are
slightly favored in performance mode but
that's more so on 0.1% then on the 1%
side moving the watchdog's
2 we see that the power modes have
almost no impact on results performance
mode is marginally ahead and averages
and lows though that's insignificant and
the two are effectively tied we saw
noteworthy differences emerge in
battlefield 1 with DirectX 11 where we
move from 117 about 3 FPS average to 130
132 FPS average this is finally a
significant we also noticed higher
low-end performance with this mode less
significant in percentage gains than the
averages but still noteworthy overall
GTA 5 also opposed today gain with
performance mode moving us from one 17.7
average to 120 4.5 fps
and that's a change of about five to six
percent improvement again our reviews
contained all performance mode numbers
so this changes nothing with regard to
conclusions on the 1700 and 1800 acts as
they stand today it does provide some
information as to how balanced mode
could affect results
if you're using Windows 10 and its
default power mode and you wanted to
know if it's worth disabling or going to
high performance instead next we're
moving on to XFR and frequency behavior
under the two different power states
again balanced and performance same
thing here that's our a/b for right now
we can learn about how the r7 1700 in
this instance responds to the different
power modes we're really just using
Cinebench and pov-ray for these because
synthetics provide a really good
baseline we just need a foundational
understanding of what's going on nothing
the crazy and depth here so the point is
to gain that through repeatable
synthetics that have multi-threaded and
single threaded options Cinebench and
pov-ray provide that quick note before
we start patrick discovered a bug in a
hardware monitor when we were working on
this so the built in chart generation
with hardware monitor means that the
peaks and the lows in the charts that
are pre generated if you use those that
supplies to you will be inaccurate the
way it works the way the bug works is
hardware monitor captures the
frequencies every 0.5 seconds and when
it does so it's trying to do some
predictions so it might see let's say 37
50 megahertz three times in a row if it
does you'll get a plateau so it hits
3750 that flattens and then continues
however it may continue that is the max
if it captures 3750 once or twice
Hardware monitor will spike
so it'll jump up higher as if it's
trying to predict it because there's no
third data point and that number is
inaccurate so if you see in our charts
I've kind of really hastily fixed that
by using just a photoshop Paint Bucket
basically that flattens things out but
the CSV itself is accurate so if you
look through the CSV on the same data
point you'll see that the data point
that's being extrapolated does not exist
in the CSV but the graph generation does
something funny so don't trust that
Foley it's still fairly accurate overall
just that'll give you the wrong
impression this also
applies to the low-end so anything that
dips below the orange line at the very
bottom that's not real that's just an
error of hardware monitor one more thing
the y-axis scale is different between
charts not a fan of that but again these
are quick tests and we're using a harder
monitor to generate the graphs just to
give a better understanding that's more
Universal overall reisen's frequency
adjustment features are explained in
detail in a post on the ANA tech forums
but the gist of it is this for each rise
in CPU there is a base frequency across
all cores a boost frequency across all
cores a base frequency for a single core
and an xfr frequency for a single core
for the 1800 X these frequencies are our
3.6 3.7 4.0 and 4.1 respectively empty
does not advertise that XF our number on
its boxes so you'll see 4.0 instead of
4.1 for example and our power draw
testing we found that the 1800 X would
keep all cores at 3.7 gigahertz went
under 100% load but would boost one core
to four point one gigahertz in single
threaded synthetic test so that should
give you an idea of how it actually
works this chart shows the r7 1,700 non
x in a Cinebench one thread benchmark
with high performance of mode selected
in Windows we smoothed out those
erroneous outputs by hardware monitor at
the top with a quick Photoshop Pass and
note that we're seeing the cores that
take turns boosting up to X if our
frequencies then falling as another core
takes over let's get the r7 1700
Cinebench multi-threaded chart onto the
screen to provide some perspective when
all threads are engaged this is also in
high performance mode as seen in the
graphs on the screen now the r7 1700
running Cinebench and high performance
mode all cores engaged remains at 3.2
gigahertz
that's the multi thread limit when
everything's under a hundred percent
load in single threaded tests individual
cores a boost up to three point seven
five gigahertz the peaks above this
again that we've smoothed out are due to
harder monitor graphing software issues
so our seven seventeen hundreds at non
axe demarkation contributes to its lower
XFR range if that was the curiosity to
you and of course this also means that
overclocking decreases your
single-threaded performance provided the
OC is lower than the
our frequency that's really only likely
to be true for the 18-yard ex because
it's easy to OCD past XF are on
seventeen hundred and seventeen hundred
x CPUs this also relates to high
performance mode in Windows which sets
the minimum clock speed to the current
base clock of the processor and in the
process of doing so reduces latency as
the CPU is forced to ramp in to
workloads by minimizing the frequency
modulation and power saving functions
performance ensures that the rise in
CPUs are working at full capacity during
workloads or as close to it as
permissible given the platform and OS
limitations that may exist here's the
next chart this one shows the 1700 score
frequency during pov-ray single-threaded
benchmarks still using high performance
mode in Windows again ignore those files
at the bottom of the chart those are
from the hardware monitor bug we're
seeing all cores take turns of boosting
to higher frequencies during this test
switching to balanced mode for which we
have another chart changes things a bit
will pop that onto the screen now
suddenly we're looking at just two of
the core is performing the boosting with
the rest being unutilized in balance
mode of course four to seven set at 1.5
gigahertz constantly cores a three and
two alternate between 1.5 and 1.4 to 2
core 1 ranged anywhere from 1.5 to 3.75
and core zero maintained a relatively
constant 3.2 it's a 3.75 gigahertz
there's definitely a visible effect from
windows power settings and boosting in
balanced mode it seems to prefer one or
two cores rather than bouncing between
them constantly some testing in
Cinebench suggests a mild
single-threaded performance advantage in
balanced mode if anything at all and we
see a 145 that to 5 balance first 140
7.5 average performance in CB marks
that's after about half a dozen passes
or so but it seems that the end result
isn't much affected by windows power
settings for single threaded as
discussed in our 1802 extra view and
just a moment ago high performance mode
it does seem to have a positive impact
generally on gaming or none at all
depending on the multi-threading and how
the game is behaved high performance
mode isn't great for power consumption
especially for overclocked CPUs that
will be forced to constantly run out
there
see frequency so that's it for this one
no big conclusion or anything just data
and research to recap the ACS 5 7:04 efi
version we use for our review testing
based on these results was the right one
to use also the only choice you really
had at the time gigabyte doesn't show a
whole lot of change between f3 and f3n
unless you were memory limited to begin
with f5 exists we might look at it we
might wait for def 7 or whatever is next
and asus has new versions basically efi
versions are rolling out almost every
day to reviewers and especially
internally so we are going to be kind of
waiting and following a cadence that's
every other every couple efi versions
other than that there's that pretty much
sums up all of our research so hopefully
that helps you understand some of the
things better that we've looked at over
the past week or so
power versus balance versus
high-performance States was one of the
more interesting things to look at in
terms of performance with the games and
synthetic tests full articles in the
