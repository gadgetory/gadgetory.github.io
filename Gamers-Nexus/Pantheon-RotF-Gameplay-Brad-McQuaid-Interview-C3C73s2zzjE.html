dotnet and we're at GDC 2016 now looking
at some mmorpgs is a bit of a turn for
our coverage today and i'm joined by
Brad McQuaid to talk about Pantheon
which is a new MMO that definitely
reminds me of EverQuest but before we
get to that are all of our GDC 2016
coverage is brought to you by raw Furies
goner game and you can see that on the
screen now Brad so you've obviously got
a pretty big history with EverQuest and
Vanguard what have you brought forward
to pantheon and what are some things
that maybe you've called from the older
titles well we think with the main thing
we want to bring back is a social game a
cooperative game where players need each
other they have time to make friends
real friendships with each other they
can really call the game a home it's not
going to be a situation where you're
just wandering around an online world
and in the server is you know you go
come to an instance dungeon and the
server just picks a bunch of random
people to go with you and you run run
through the dungeon and then you never
see them again it's definitely about
that shared experience that social
cooperative nature day games out but I
think that's the biggest thing that we
need to bring back and that I would
actually say needs to come back to
massively multiplayer games and how
about items that have maybe not aged as
well from 99 EverQuest or something like
that what's what's been gotten rid of
that you specifically don't think age
well well are you know I a lot of our
audience are ideal you know they play
the old games we also want to appeal to
a newer the newer generation that wasn't
even around for the first generation of
MMOs who are seeking you know they've
enjoyed a co-op and play like playing
call of duty or whatever but they've
never really experienced it you know
playing with their friends against the
environment in a persistent world but
there is a reality and that is a lot of
people have grown up they've got
responsibilities now spouses jobs etc so
a lot of the you know the needless
repetition too much briny grinding you
know sitting there for
hours working on your factions and then
we're trying to keep the sessions
basically shorter so yeah you can sit
there and play as long as you want but
the way we're setting up the world
populating at setting up the class we're
targeting about Mac not a two-hour
session so that a person can still log
on with his friends play a couple hours
and have a sense of accomplishment
achieve something progress their
character get some item they needed and
it doesn't have to be you know the six
eight ten our crazy session because this
is this it's just not really compatible
people's lives anymore they've got
responsibilities so if we can bring back
that magic without you know the tedium
or the excess of time and the excess of
grind I think that's the way to go
bringing bringing the genre for debris
and that's what we're interested in so
one of the things that comes to my mind
when I was playing the older games was
travel and specifically for anyone who
played everquest sort of pre planes of
power it was a lot more physically
wandering around the landscape how are
you working with travel in pantheon well
first of all you will be doing a lot of
running around but as you've shown you
the demo we've created interesting
points you know points to explore you
shouldn't just be sitting there
endlessly running across the desert you
know board the travelling to be
meaningful the perception system we have
you'll be learning about the environment
as you go along one thing though we and
we don't know this until we get into
beta and we have enough players you have
enough critical mass there you know it
could be creating this epic world that
there does need to be some limited
teleportation and if that does become
necessary you know we will put implement
that it'd probably be keyed you'd have
to get to the area first and explore
kind of like rebellious and so yeah so
we're going to there's there are
decisions that we aren't going to
finalize until we have enough critical
mass in the beta where we can experiment
with these things and tune it and get it
right for our target audiences you know
obviously we can't make it right
for everyone but for our core target
audience who's been looking forward to
this game you know it definitely is the
same thing we don't we haven't announced
exactly how that's going to work how is
it you know are you going to win you
know when you dies or corpse can have
all your items on it or not things like
that we want to tune that and get
players feedback during beta before we
set any of that in stone right so
definitely sounds interesting to me if
you want to read the full article
