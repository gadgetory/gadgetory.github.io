net and we've made it back from CES 2016
if you're curious what's coming out this
year or what is already out from the
world's biggest consumer electronics
trade show do check out the channel or
website for more information on that
today we have a quick news item from
Intel so this is actually a rumor but
it's a somewhat back through more we do
think that there's some possibility that
this is all true the new Intel Xeon
chips are currently known to be on
broadwell EP that is not rumored to the
rumor is that the e5 2602 v4 that's a
quad-core xeon chip on Broadwell EP
silicon is looking at the possibility of
shipping 5.1 gigahertz stock so that is
a very high frequency and sort of
reminds me of the days where there are
frequency races and battles between AMD
and intel there's not been a chip
shipping quite this high frequency from
intel in a long time so if the rumor is
true it would be very interesting to
give you all an idea of what xeon is if
you don't know what xeon is it is a
workstation or sometimes server targeted
alternative to what we see in the gaming
market that would be the i7s life I've
is the case you CPUs that are often
unlocked for overclocking Xeon takes a
very similar and sometimes same but
normally just similar with some tweaks
architecture to the existing
architecture that we see I'm a game
inside and remove some features like
overclocking but adds other features
that may be beneficial to workstation
environments and things like that just
like the chipsets between all the
different types of chipsets qbz h they
all take or add things based on the
market they're targeted at now is eon
has been used pretty heavily in gaming
systems in the past and this is
especially true because z on ships are
only a little bit cheaper than the case
key version of what we see on the gaming
side but they provide very similar
performance if you don't want the
overclocking or whatever features have
been stripped out of that particular
version of the modern Xeon chip so
broadwell EP silicon the things we do
know for a fact are that it is on LGA
2011 v3 so that's the extreme series
socket type it's a larger socket larger
chip and it's also the xeon e5 2602 v4
or that's looking at the 5.1 gigahertz
rumored clock rate which is a quad-core
xeon chip there should be eight core
options out there as well but we're not
sure exactly on what those skus will be
just yet there's 10 megabytes of l3
cache it supports quad channel memory as
the extreme series cpus tend to do and
it's looking at again a four to eight
core shipping options depending on on
which skew you're looking at
specifically so that is all for that
quick news item 5.1 Giga it should be a
pretty big deal for Xeon CPUs and would
definitely make them viable in the
gaming market if you don't necessarily
want to draw up a thousand bucks on
another extreme CCP at the top end or if
you wanted to sacrifice your
overclocking ability and some of the
other options on case Q gaming CPUs in
favor of perhaps we're not sure yet a
cheaper alternative in the Xeon area
with an improved architecture and faster
stock clock rate so definitely worth
looking at xeon chips are always very
interesting for this reason they may be
fairly viable solutions for gaming in
the immediate future and of course for
