at a new mouse and keyboard from
Logitech both of which are wireless this
is the G 603 I also have the G 613
keyboard next to me but we're starting
with the mouse because it's got a few
changes from what we've seen previously
primarily in the form of the sensor
which is the new hero sensor before
getting to that this coverage is brought
to you by the EVGA 1080 TI sc2 and
NVIDIA Destiny to bundle running up
through September 4th the 1080i sc2
comes with a synchronous fan control for
its dual fans and nine thermal sensors
and again includes destiny to learn more
at the link in the description below so
for the mouse the G 603 I want to
address a rumour first off when this was
announced there's a rumor going around
that if you remove the battery because
you can actually do that and still use
it it would have lower performance the
thinnest these batteries run in parallel
they're not serial so because they run
in parallel you've got an interesting
solution to wait if you think it's too
heavy you take a battery out and you
lose however much that way is 15 grams
something like that now a tactically
offsets the center of balance a little
bit or center of mass but in terms of
performance the sensitivity is going to
be the same the report rates going to be
the same everything will behave the same
on the performance side you just lose
half your capacity so if you don't want
to have the capacity but you're good on
the weight side then there's your
solution but that's just to address the
rumor so in terms of accessing it though
it's a magnetic setup you just pull the
body off and comes off just like that
the spring retention or spring
tensioning systems on the underside we
have b-roll of it if you want to see it
and we've talked about it before in more
detail with the some of the powerplay
coverage the G 900 coverage things like
that the mouse interestingly it's got
two switches on the bottom one's a
wireless and one's a bluetooth and the
other ones a high and a low speed for
the wireless and Bluetooth the sensor
this may interest people who have seen
our recent synergy ads as a an
alternative to that you can switch to
wireless if you want to use it on your
performance gaming PC for example
behaves the same as the lights speed
sensor in the G 900 so fast or faster or
as fast as
a wired device in terms of input latency
in response or you switch to Bluetooth
mode and it can connect to another
system so you're still running the
different host OS is the mouse isn't
moving between systems there's no cross
file transfer things like that but you
can run one keyboard mouse out of KPM
without and over the network software
solution and just switch between
Bluetooth and wireless so I thought that
was an interesting use case for our
audience in our own use we can use it
between the random machine and the
compression machine in game are you
she'd use it between gaming and
streaming boxes and that would probably
be be the main use case just switch
between them for the hero sensor the big
number they're giving us here is 17,000
fps so that's I to give some perspective
the 3366 I'm pretty sure is a 12 K FPS
sensor but the bigger difference is that
the form of tracking for the hero sensor
is continuous so it should adjust on the
fly now it's not going to adjust to the
level of single FPS numbers it's still
steps but it should adjust on the fly
continuously for the framerate which
that number changes based on how fast
you're moving so if you're like
counter-strike player doing flick to the
wrist movements you'll be closer or at
that 17:17 k max number versus office is
much lower the 3366
is a 12 k FPS sensor and it adjusts in
steps or increments so rather than the
continuous adjustment it might be X out
X thousand Y thousand mm we don't know
the exact numbers but that's the main
difference from what we've been told
there's no appreciable noticeable
difference between the sensors in terms
of performance you can probably find
them if you set it up to a machine but
you're not going to be able to
appreciate them in general as a user the
high and low speed switch so low speed
changes the response from 8 milliseconds
or from one millisecond to 8
milliseconds so we go into the low-speed
8 milliseconds uses a lot less power but
I mean that's the advantage is suppose
to be about three times more battery
life from what they tell us and if you
go into high speed it's one millisecond
performance as normally expected 500
hours of use continuous non-stop put it
on a dolly over a service and that's
what you get and that should be four to
six months in terms of actual user use
cases the keyboard is next so the MAOIs
is 70 the keyboards 150 neither of these
use the new power play module that we
show with our power play and g9 or three
review coming up after the show but
they're both wireless keyboard runs on
double aces wild mouse runs on double
a's and they accept either alkaline
lithium ion all the normal stuff the
keyboard also has the Bluetooth and
wireless switching that the mouse has
they do run on different receivers so
you plug the receiver in just like this
and you'd run one for each device if you
wanted that setup switches it's got
romaji switches so there logitech
version of mechanical switches we've
covered them the bath in the past they
feel similar to the brown switches with
a rubber o-ring on them and you're
wondering what they feel like the
keyboard itself normal set of keys not
tkl it's got media buttons it has a game
mode switch and it's got the wireless
and Bluetooth switches the double-a
batteries are expected to last something
like 18 months I asked that's not a
continuous use that's gaming and office
use everyday we don't know how many
hours or anything like that but
basically it's a simulated use case 18
months is what they're projecting the
mouse as I said 500 hours continuous
four to six months otherwise with high
speed and then three times that with low
speed I think that pretty much covers it
so that's that's what we know right now
for the G 613 and G 603 we'll have
additional coverage throughout the show
