recap for the last week despite being a
holiday week there's still a lot of news
to cover including some stuff on briefly
ice Lake and whiskey Lake from Intel and
there's also allegedly a GTX 1060 5
gigabyte card now for the fourth variant
of GTX 1060 s awesome news on the Asus
1080i Strix PCB changes that have been
discussed and videos a ban of geforce
cards and data centers and then some AMD
news as well before that this coverage
is brought to you by Silicon Lottery
comm Silicon lottery offers deleting
services and also pre bins CPUs this
includes determining what sort of clocks
the CPU can achieve at different
voltages and then they provide you the
option to buy those different bins of
CPUs if you're in search of something
specific to learn more check out silicon
Madhuri comm or click on the link in the
description below preceding our first
news item just a quick update we have a
five-dollar patreon tier that gives you
behind-the-scenes vlogs that we started
doing the last couple weeks so the
second one of those just went live on
the side channel all of the patreon
backers at 5 dollars and up can see it
you can just go to patreon.com/scishow
Cameron's Nexus login and you'll find
the link there so that's stated oh and I
should also notice note that a snowflake
starting at briefly with this Corsair
ornaments of course they are sent a
shiny tree ornament with their logo and
RGB everything and it was wrapped in an
RGB ribbon I guess it was all everything
was RGB from Corsair this here so first
news item pertains to memory prices over
the last no it feels like a year or two
at this point we've been talking about
how memory prices are making it really a
lot more expensive than it ever has
needed to be to get into PC gaming to
the point where we're seeing prices that
are up a hundred and twenty percent from
what they were roughly a year ago and
that's been bad news for PC gaming PC
building the newest information out of
that front though is that China's
National Development and Reform
Commission
or NDRC is reportedly looking into the
possibility of DRAM price-fixing between
the major memory and flash suppliers
with specific interest from the pricing
supervision department of that
commission so an official from the
regulatory bodies hold the China Daily
which is a state-run paper quote we have
noticed the price surge and will pay
more attention to future problems that
may be caused by quote price-fixing in
the sector and quote on that one so this
follows Samsung's plans to again
allegedly increase their supply by 20%
from earlier this year just a couple
months ago and that still would have
failed to meet rising demand the NDRC
told the China Daily that the company
has paid attention to DRAM pricing and
and pricing over the last 18 months and
that the memory suppliers are now under
the eye of the NDRC in fact Samsung has
reportedly already had conversations at
the NDRC and that's according to the
Secretary General of Mobile China
Alliance at this time there's been no
actions taken against any of the four
major memory suppliers that would
include SK Hynix microns Achieva and
Samsung but it's something that the
Chinese government regulatory body is
looking into so we'll keep an eye on
that one and see if it goes anywhere one
more thing though this isn't the first
time that the memory industry has been
looked into for price-fixing in fact the
first time they were looked at for price
fixing there was actual collusion found
on fixing the prices of memory so we'll
see if they've learned anything Nvidia
is reportedly readying a GTX 1060 5
gigabyte model this if it comes to be
and it looks like it is legitimate at
this point will be the 4th GTX 1060 that
Nvidia has created however it's not
targeted for DIY PC builders so
basically any of us and it is also not
really targeted at markets outside of
Asia so this is something that is from
what we've read thus far from XP review
a Chinese language news outlet it looks
like this gtx 760 5 gigabyte card is
meant for internet cafes pc Bains things
like that in china or potentially
and other Asian markets the card is a
little bit different than just the vram
so it also will have a slightly reduced
memory bus width it's going to be 160
bits rather than 192 which goes
hand-in-hand with five gigabytes it's
still 1280 CUDA cores whereas the 10 63
gigabyte was 1152 CUDA cores and the
other 1060 if you're wondering was the
1066 gigabyte with faster memory so some
of those cards are starting to kind of
pop up online already but that's that's
what it looks like they're doing now if
you want to think about why this might
be the case there's obviously a huge
market in China and Asia for this type
of device but is it a market that
exceeds or it doesn't exceed what is
already provided by the 1066 and three
gigabyte cards I don't know maybe
there's that much demand but this is the
kind of thing that you'd potentially
make if you have if the extra 1 gigabyte
difference has enough cost savings to
really be worth it but three gigabytes
is like going too far it's really weird
it's this this is like extreme product
segmentation they're doing to be fair
not targeted at PC enthusiasts but still
it's it's interesting we'll see what
happens maybe it's some kind of silicon
bending thing or they've just got a bin
of chips that have partly defective
memory controllers or something like
that
next news item though so hardware info
is one of the best tools for measuring
really anything in your computer sensors
all that stuff hardware info 64 it's a
free software utility we use it for
logging a lot of thermal and voltage
numbers and it's been historically
pretty accurate and reliable even before
products launch which is something that
can't always be said about a lot of
other monitoring solutions on the market
so hardware info is the latest 5.7
update has resolved a couple of things
and has added some interesting items one
of them is that it's added support for
ice Lake and whiskey Lake which we'll
come back to in a moment
and it's also resolved some of Vegas
thermal monitoring bugs that popped up
with the latest Radeon adrenaline
drivers that
17.11.2013 support and it's also adding
correct t.j.maxx reporting for Zeppelin
dies which will be nice as well
a t.j.maxx being the maximum temperature
junction temperature before CPU thermal
event that's typically thermal shutdown
or thermal throttling depending on how
your motherboard is configured the 400
series chipsets port is not yet added
despite some news posts it is going to
be added for the next release though so
it's on the way and this will become
relevant toward the beginning of second
quarter 2018 and the first quarter
somewhere in there
as for isolation whisky lake support
these are looking to be relevant in 2018
and after these you can expect that
after ice Lake comes water lake which is
what you get when you add Intel's Tim to
ice lake and after whiskey Lake I think
is coming Gatorade Lake so keep an eye
out for those there's will be very
important processor launches in 2032 the
next one Titan V support was added as
well Tom's Hardware further notice that
hardware info 64 added Intel's
multi-core turbo bins so this is
something that you could previously find
in PTU their power thermal testing
utility or other developer tools but now
it's being exposed through a more
consumer available software solution and
that will give you a table like we had
the chart on our 8700 k coverage where
you can see the bins for what frequency
you can expect to operate at for how
many cores or threads are engaged and
that can be fetched directly through
hard rainbow we were pointed toward this
next news item from a couple of people
in the Twitter and patreon communities
so several of people contacted us over
an EK water blocks message about the
asus 1080i Strix card that received
critical acclaim from our outlet this
year they use card has undergone a PCB
change that requires EK water blocks to
rework their cooler design and that's if
the company wishes to continue the
support of this PCB this kind of feeds
back to where we try to bring some
level-headedness
to the situation first of all not to be
deal but secondly whenever any kind of
change happens to a product you'll get a
sort of discussion that makes it sound
as if it's an evil change or something
where they're trying to take something
away from you
in all likelihood and this is very
common for PCBs to be reworked without a
major announcement in all likelihood
Asus probably had a supply-side change
maybe some component they were sourcing
is no longer available because some
other factor in the market spun up and
started taking them or that company
might have stopped making that
particular component or it could just be
they found that there's a better way to
make whatever it is they reworked we're
not sure what that is just yet but
either way it's PCB change it's not a
cooler change or anything like that and
apparently it was enough where eks
blocks are not compatible with the ten
atti in its new form so ek is warning
that models made after mid November are
affected they have a list of serial
numbers that are affected you can check
your card to make sure it is or is not
and this is we're not sure yet if EK is
going to use this to step away from the
line or if they're going to continue
making stuff for the 1080i Strix and
just modify it to fit the new one we
contacted to Asus about this and haven't
yet heard back it's probably because
everyone's out of office for the
holidays and we also talked to build
Zoid about it who is aware of the change
but didn't have any further information
about it at this time so that's all we
know about that one basically this kind
of feeds into why when media outlets or
when users ask a company hey what
MOSFETs are on there they won't answer
is the same thing logitech or Mouse
companies do what sent or what what
switches are you using they won't answer
the reason for that is not because
they're necessarily trying to hide
something but because their supply could
change and they don't want to be held to
that statement later if supply changes
because you're not just gonna kill the
whole product line and start a new one
that would make much sense for something
where you can source a similar switch
with the same spec and things like that
just from a different supplier so we're
not sure what the change was though it
could be more extreme than that or it
might be nothing but we'll wait for a
comment from Asus
on NVIDIA Ben's geforce in data centers
so there's nothing there's nothing
alleged or reported about this it just
is this is what happened what's
happening and videos new end-user
License Agreement has been updated to
contain the following quote no data
center deployment period pretty
cut-and-dry there it also says the
software is not licensed for data center
deployments this is referring to the
driver package except that blockchain
processing in a data center is permitted
so this protects cryptocurrency miners
operating in data center environments
with a lot of geforce cards
interestingly but it impacts potentially
enterprise clients although those are
mostly going to be on Tesla's anyway or
more likely universities academics and
researchers who might not have the
budget or the need to go something like
a Tesla or a Quadro card where you have
professional level certifications and
guarantees which have different
liability protections attached to them
it's more likely going to affect those
universities economics people like that
so this is basically dictating how the
cards can be used but to a point where
they're allowing it for cryptocurrency
mining it's almost like they said well
we can't Institute this change for
cryptocurrency miners that's not fair
they bought a lot of cards but
universities yeah they can afford
Tesla's and Quadros is it's basically
it's trying to force the market into
adopting the higher to your cards that
are more intended for these use cases
now whether this is a valid move from a
support standpoint things like that
legal standpoint I'm not really sure at
this time but it's definitely further
market segmentation it is going to
affect independent or university or
academic researchers the most and
they're not going to be able to leverage
geforce cards in the same way if they
want to continue receiving nvidia
support so that's kind of the situation
those people
and however there they say screw all of
this Cancer Research let's start mining
coins then they're apparently protected
so it's a very odd thing that anybody
has carved out here they they almost
could have had a support leg to stand on
with just a blanket ban of geforce cards
in a data center environment maybe but
if it's like blanket ban but those
cryptocurrency miners are fine kind of
taken away the support leg a little bit
of a weird decision there I it it has
not been received well a high and I
don't know that it's a great decision in
general the next one here so this is the
Andes 400 series chipset news and E 400
series chips that was spotted on the PCI
si G integrators devices list and this
just means that we know a little bit
more about how the chipset is connecting
to the CPU and its other changes that
are accompanied by that those include a
change the general-purpose PCIe lanes so
Andy is moving away from eight lanes
PCIe gen to towards eight lanes PCIe
gen3 the general purpose lanes are this
exists on Intel's well they can be
assigned to pretty much whatever the
motherboard maker wants to use them for
you can assign them to a PCIe device
maybe a by four device you can assign
them to m dot two it's a Gigabit
Ethernet to USB to a whole bunch of SATA
or YouTube ports things like that so
that's been changed just up to Gen 3
which will give them a bit more
bandwidth to work with so you can use
fewer lanes to accomplish the same goal
with an M 2 device or you can run 32 you
can run faster and about two devices on
it as well this is going to be on the
next-generation rise and launch it's
going to be a plus generation we are
calling it rising plus right now we're
not sure what I am DS gonna call it it
may end up being called risin to however
don't confuse that with Zen 2
architecture which isn't releasing for
some time so could potentially be
confusing there we are calling it rising
plus for that reason and finally opera
implemented mining protections in there
my browser opera is one of the older web
browsers and one of the best ones so
back when I used opera when you paid 10
or 20 dollars for it you bought it on
the disk and now it's free of course but
opera has a no coin a web mining
extension that prevents mining from web
sites like for example we recently saw
the hardware bought forums do mining
when you visit the site this is
something that sites are doing now
instead of ads so operas got a tool in
there to prevent that if you're worried
about that sales for this week the
logitech c920 was $50 marked down from
the usual 100 ish price point for the
web cam this is the web cam we've used
for some interviews in the past and
there's also an AOC
C 408 vu 8 monitor which is a 40 inch 4k
curved display 10-bit color 5
millisecond Grady gray that's been on
sale in multiple occasions for $600 as
well those are all worth looking into if
