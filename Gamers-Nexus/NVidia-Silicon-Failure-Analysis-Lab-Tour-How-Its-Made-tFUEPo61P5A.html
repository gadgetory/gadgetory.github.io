at Nvidia for the technology operations
silicon failure analysis lab early on we
decided that we needed to have a
world-class failure analysis lab that we
could look inside of our chips to make
sure that they work and what we're
getting out of them one of our prime
tools here is our focused ion beam by
made by Fei a 2.6 million dollar machine
that allows us to go in and actually cut
into the device to go see where the
failures are it consists of a focused
ion beam using a gallium ion which is
made up of protons and neutrons so it's
a very large atom and when it comes down
it actually can mill a hole into the
device so we can actually cross-section
and see exactly what's inside our device
it also contains in it a scanning
electron microscope which allows us to
magnify and image exactly what's going
on up to 1.5 million x and giving us a
seven angstrom resolution to go look at
the very small materials inside our
device what they're made of and look for
any problems that we can find this is
our next one this is a 3d x-ray x-ray
allows us to look through the device for
any shorts if you look through a device
a device is made up of a chip on top of
a substrate on a PC board and you can
actually see multiple bumps on the x-ray
image of the - of the chip on the
substrate the substrate bumps and the PC
board so unfortunately that means that
there's a ball on top of a ball and you
can only see the one ball however if you
rotated it while you were taking your
images you could actually see this made
up of two balls so this machine can
actually rotate the chip take thousands
of images and then we take and convert
those images into a movie it used to
take 11 hours to do that conversion now
using that CUDA card with takes only
three minutes to do that same conversion
hence we get a 3d image of exactly what
is inside the chip we can see the bond
wires we can see the interfaces we can
see
the balls we can see the vias between
inside the PC board so that we can look
for problems and look for how it's made
and how well it's made all right here we
have another piece of equipment this is
our backside probing this is our
omission system when a transistor turns
on inside the device electrons travel
through the semiconductor channel and
give off photons they give off both
infrared photons in the thermal range
and in the emission range so that we can
look and find out where the failing
transistor is this is actually an upside
down camera so that we can then put a PC
on top of here and actually look inside
the chip while it's running an
application it has in a camera the same
kind of camera used in the Hubble
telescope to go look at little points of
light from the stars which is the same
infrared light that comes out of our
chip when a transistor turns on the
camera is actually kept at liquid
nitrogen temperatures in order for the
camera to not contribute any heat to the
source it has maximum magnification so
that we can see all the way down to a
transistor and see how it behaves
thanks for coming visit us at the Nvidia
silicon failure analysis lab see us on
