highlighted performance of the chips
with SMT disabled the test that we came
up with pre-release based on historical
testing with Intel hyper-threading as
stated in the original content and in
some old Intel benchmarks of ours
hyper-threading hasn't always been a net
positive overhead sometimes detracted
from average FPS by a couple percent at
times and so we added SMT tog wins who
our rise in testing but there's been
non-stop demand to apply SMT zero and an
overclock to the 1700 to show and in the
best possible light we're following up
today on the audience requests and we'll
be walking through the results here
before getting to that this is brought
to you by thermal takes powered 900
enclosure built like a display case for
PC components the tower 900 can fit full
custom water loops and Orient's the
system to put all components on display
like a showroom learn more of the link
in the description below this test is
built around user requests so keep that
in mind going into the content we are
using the r7 1700 the CPU that we most
pray is out of the current lineup of r7
CPUs as it does more or less outperform
for the price the 1800 X especially when
overclocked we're using that and we're
showing it sort of in the best white by
combining all of our auxilliary tests in
these 1700 reviews that includes SMT off
and overclocking so the two of them
together now in a benchmark rather than
just doing one or the other because
there was a time limitation so we will
be looking at that today we're
overclocking we're turning off SMT and
as a reminder from the 1700 review we
are increasing the memory clock with the
overclocked 1700 that means that this is
not a perfect a be test a perfect a be
test would be where we compared really
just one or two things off and on really
one thing technically but the thing here
is that the 1700 our model was not
capable of exceeding 2666 megahertz
without overclocking the CPU itself or
changing the reference clock or
something like that so that means our
testing looks at the performance stock
with a lower memory speed 2666
versus the 29 33 megahertz of the
overclocked 1700 because that's what we
were able to achieve and as stated in
the
7100 review the point was really to push
it with the overclock and not do an a/b
test and see what is possible under
better conditions we are continuing that
today especially because that's what was
largely requested by folks reading and
viewing the content so keep all that in
mind we have three games tested with
four states of the r7 1700 with another
few games tested with three states of
the r7 1700 the main games to look at
our battles of one-offs r2 and total war
Warhammer the last of which previously
showed tremendous performance gains by
disabling SMT on all rise and CPUs we've
tested thus far that's all three that
exists for full test methods check T
1700 review the article and you can also
check the new article link in the
description below between these two
you'll find most of the information that
you need if not all of it Patrick Lathan
ran these tests for GN and wrote the
article so be sure to check out his work
as well in that link battlefield one had
a minor increase from 135 FPS average
overclocked and SMT enabled to 130 5.7
the average FPS with SMT disabled and
the overclocked applied with the stock
r7 1700 we're looking at 129 FPS average
as the base and disabling SMT increased
the average by about 2.6 percent and
averages again we're not looking too
close yet overclock can increase it by
about 4.7 percent and doing both
increased it by about 5.2 percent now
I'll point out that percentages are not
always perfect for measurements because
they can make things sound a lot bigger
or smaller than they are in reality at
this point comparing with them is sort
of silly because the fact is disabling
an SMP on the overclocked 1700
can does less than 1 FPS average which
is within range of errors 0.7 FPS
average gain for this particular
benchmark because one we're running it
manually it is not an automated
benchmark and to Battlefield 1 has some
unique behavior with data streaming as
we've explained in previous content
pieces that said the improvement in
frame x is noteworthy as we've stated
several times in these rise in product
reviews or studies the difference
demonstrated between the overclock
that's on t1 and OCSP 0 is not visible
in so far as user experience but it's
certainly measurable and repeatable
in terms of benchmarking and logging
disabling SMT continues to prove
beneficial for frame times in this title
and we'll see that to be a trend in a
couple of the other games tested the
really interesting results came from
watchdog 2 and as usual total war
Warhammer
Bob talks to prove to be one of the most
CPU intensive games in our graphic
settings study for the game where we
looked at optimizing the settings within
the game for different CPUs the game
also allowed the 1700 with SMT 0 and
overclocking to attain a relatively
competitive 91.3 FPS average placing it
above and these own 1800 X and below
Intel's
aging at stock i7 4790k this performance
is mostly notable when looking at these
seventeen hundred's own results
watchdogs to didn't initially perform
any better with SMP disabled but when
overclocked disabling the SMP performs a
bit better and jointly we're looking at
about a fourteen point two percent
better performance than stock that's
with OSI and SMT disabled ocbn at four
gigahertz total war Warhammer
total war hammer is one of the games
that specifically cited by Andy as been
in the process of optimization and we're
eagerly awaiting any patches given these
results we're seen an 11% increase over
SMT zero with no OC thirteen point eight
percent over eight plain overclock and a
massive twenty nine point two percent
increase in average FPS over the out of
box stock seventeen hundred with 2666
makers memory in terms of raw numbers
that's a jump from 120 to 155 FPS
average went under the best condition
but again keep in mind that there's also
a memory speed change as requested by
viewers and readers in the previous
content though it's really not that
responsible in this particular game for
the gains of seen 150 4.7 FTS average
places the 1700 just below the last gen
I 560 600 K in our tests but if these
fluctuations are any indication there's
some room for easy optimisation by
Creative Assembly we'll be keeping a
close eye on total Warhammer in the near
future and hopefully it'll serve as an
indication of just how much software
changes can
fact and these hardware performance when
it comes to risin and SMT optimization
we're now entering territory where we
don't have SMT zero plus stock tests but
can still compare against the overclock
plus SMT test time is limited here and
we don't have it the huge team required
to run infinite tests as some folks seem
to think we do but the least impressive
result on our bench was in ashes of the
singularity with DirectX 12 which showed
a miniscule within range of error
decrease in performance over a plane
overclocked ideally we'd see a
significant performance decrease by
disabling SMT but no effect is a good
start you can look at our 1800 x sm t 1
and 0 tests for some further information
on how a Rison behaves in this title
note that this particular workload is
intensive on the CPUs so we'll need to
defer to titles which achieve higher
framerate to better see the fluctuation
Metro last light and GTA both showed
minor performance increases of 1 to 2
fps in average nothing for a real user
to consider disabling SMT / dumping SMT
continues to improve our frame times as
shown in previous tests so those changes
aren't always actually visible to the
user so again that's totally worth
disabling SMT / you're jumping between
BIOS probably for nothing for the most
part charge support these are in the
article below if you want more detail on
Metro last light and GTA 5 specifically
we only performed one synthetic or
render test here as this was primarily
an issue with gaming performance not
much point in looking at render
performance Cinebench isn't a real
workload so to speak but it is an Andy
favorite and somewhat a simulation of
rendering and it takes the full
advantage of Andy's new 8 cord 16 thread
our 7 CPUs as such multi-threaded scores
are the relevance numbers here not
single threaded as we covered previously
our 1700 at 4 gigahertz with paths empty
enabled scored at 1764 CV marks this is
significantly higher than Intel stock I
760 900 K which is three times the price
by the way as that CPU is responsible
for scoring 1470 point 5 marks mileage
may vary as the 4 gigahertz overclock
wasn't stable in longer render tests but
three point nine was and the 6900 k2v
there did score 1823 when it was
similarly overclocked
to about where its limit was without
some C disabled however these 1700
scored 1250 2.5 that's an average number
still impressive but as expected it's
much lower than when allowed to render
on all possible threads disabling SMT is
limited in gains compared to a straight
overclock but is a more guaranteed gain
the 1800 X is blown out of the water in
price to performance by the 1700 as
stated in the original 1700 review and
that is especially true when
overclocking as for disabling SMT and
overclocking those gains are limited
across the board except for total war
Warhammer which seems a bit of a
standout title watchdogs sue has some
interesting results but nothing worthy
of longer discussion which total war
certainly is disabling SMT and
overclocking has limited gains in
average FPS for the most part though
does show some more gains in a few games
in the frame times especially at the low
end so this isn't the 16 to 30 percent
increase that some people were
speculating in the comments we're really
not seen anything close to that for the
most part except for total war Warhammer
which is again somewhat of a standout
title here overall yeah there's some
performance improvement with
overclocking and SMT disabled but for
the most part you'll see the greatest
gains by just doing one of them and then
ideally leaving SMP on because just kind
of refresh everyone the argument we've
been making for the most part we stand
alongside these 1,700 as a mixed
workload CPU it is fantastic in terms of
doing things like rendering blender
premier stuff like that we've already
gone through all that in that review the
1800 X at the price not so great for
gaming in terms of value it turns out
the 1700's a lot more arguable in that
way and if you look at it from a mixed
workload user standpoint where maybe
you're doing some content creation
streaming alongside gaming the 1700 is a
pretty good choice the thing here though
is that if you are getting to the point
of disabling SMT and overclocking to get
the best gaming performance it sort of
eliminates the entire purpose of
conclusion because again the conclusion
is built on the idea that the cpu is a
good mixed workload performer if you
turn SMT off you lose all of that
suddenly it's worse than comparable
Intel chips because you've killed half
of the threads and things like blender
they don't care about whatever these
games seem to care about when it comes
to SMT on or off or performance all they
care about is more threads is better
so you see blender rendering one tile
for each thread you have 16 tiles
rendering obviously that's a lot faster
than eight so the argument basically
becomes well why you disable SMT and the
answer is because when you're
benchmarking you want to look and see
where is the potential Headroom where is
the potential choke point and what can
we learn from that data it does not mean
in this case that you should disable SMT
on a 1,700 that you purchased and use it
for gaming because if you're doing that
again value is not great and you kill
the entire production argument we're
doing production take the hit to gaming
performance and be happy with the
production performance because it's a
1,700 again you overclock it it's a good
performer that does the 1,800 X in terms
of price to performance by a long shot
it can equal the 1,800 axis performance
if overclocked assuming all overclocks
can achieve the 3.8 to 4.0 gigahertz
range on the 70 standard we'll see how
that works out as they continue to bend
chips in the future but hopefully that
answers the question so keep an eye out
