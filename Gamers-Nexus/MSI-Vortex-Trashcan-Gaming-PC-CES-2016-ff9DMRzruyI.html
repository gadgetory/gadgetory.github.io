donna and we're here at msi suite at CES
2016 next to me is the new vortex box
which kind of resembles the Apple
trashcan or whatever it's called we
don't do Apple products obviously before
we get started all this coverage is
brought to you by I by powers revolt to
small form-factor gaming PC so this is
the vortex and it's running on sort of
laptop hardware so there's two MXM cards
in here as you would find in laptops for
GPUs and there are two different SKUs
that we know right now one of them has
dual 9 60s and not clear yet if those
are two gigabyte or 4 gigabyte 9 60s the
other one is dual 9 80s and other than
that the CPU is socketed so unlike
laptops you can actually replace the CPU
which sticks true with some of the
enthusiast style building of components
that msi is used to the whole form
factor the structure is non-standard
quite obviously it is shaped as I said
like the trash can so that means is the
air intakes at the bottom and then I
think there's a blower fan at the top
which will just force it straight out
the top and away from the components the
heat sinks the copper heat sinks or
aluminum heat sinks for the MXM devices
and the CPU are all located centrally in
sort of a shaft straight down the middle
of the enclosure and then that's where
the fan comes in and pushes all the heat
straight out as far as pricing we only
know one price right now and that is
1800 to nineteen hundred dollars for the
current configuration not clear yet on
the price of the dual 981 so that's the
vortex at MSI sweet CES 2016 and check
out the link the description below for
more information or the patreon link the
postural video and I'll see you all next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
