the tech YouTube scene and also written
journalists in the technical hardware
review space just a quick note here this
was filmed at the Intel event before any
of us knew about the principal
technologies benchmarks for any of that
so there's no context of that here
instead what we'll be talking about is
entirely about the 9900 Kay revealed the
99 ATX e reveal what are the concerns
and what are the things that we thought
were good but there is ZERO discussion
about the principal detect testing
because we just it either didn't exist
publicly yet or we didn't know it
existed yet because we're at the event
so for this video we have bit wit Kyle
we have Paul or Paul's hardware we've
got joker productions jeff Kampmann from
tech report Gordon from PC world Rob
Williams from tech gauge and Marco
Chiappetta from Hardware before that
this video is brought to you by EVGA SRT
X 20 atti XE ultra video card we
recently use this to beat our founders
edition overclocking results with its
additional power target Headroom and
cooling capabilities the XE ultra uses a
2.7 extra thick heatsink for quiet
operation under low loads but also
maintains higher clocks on average over
the FE model learn more at the link in
the description below and first up I've
got bit wit Kyle how's it going bit wit
how's it going hey so Kyle's got a
YouTube channel you should probably
probably check it out I'll link it below
Kyle for the launch event here is there
anything that you found particularly
interesting good bad how do you walk
through this I think the thing that
excited me the most was it was finally
nice to is okay you hold it you dear are
you okay I was just making try to make
your life easy I was pretty excited
about the the stim or the the soldered
Tim which is I think something that
we've all been looking forward to it was
nice to have that final confirmation
from Intel today it'll be kind of
interesting to see like where the whole
d-lighting community goes with this
right I'm sure it's not gonna stop
anyone from still trying to pry it open
and see you know what can be done there
but I think it's definitely exciting the
5 gigahertz out of the box is pretty
cool too obviously we'll be able to
overclock that well beyond 5 seems and
you know pricing is pretty much in line
with what
a lot of the rumors said for at least
for the the 9900 K and I think it's I
think it's fair I mean obviously we'll
have to wait till we test it first but I
think also for me as a content creator
it kind of is nice a nice sort of
stopgap between what was like the
previous generation and like the
high-end desktop platform so you don't
have to fork out quite as much money and
you know we've been hearing rumors and
stuff from guys like Asus who are maybe
coming to the market with 32gig dims
right so I mean even if you only have
dual channel memory it's it's looking
pretty good for for a content creators
perspective so yeah round 2 for
overclocking wars yeah you know what I
didn't really quite get there to round
one so maybe this is my chance for
redemption
I'm excited all right so check out bit
wits channel I'll link it below and next
up we'll talk to Paul so next up I've
got Paul from Paul's Hardware here we
are settling our overclocking battle
with violence fisticuffs
so Paul would what did you think of this
all right so I'm always initially
excited about these because new hardware
is kind of our thing so but of course we
must be critical as well so I mean it
really it's gonna come down to testing
benchmarks performance they seemed very
positive about the gaming performance of
the 9900 Kay and that's to be expected
so yeah the pricing is still tends to be
a little bit high on the high side for
Intel I'd like to see them do less of
the here's our comparison to AMD and how
we're beating them and more of a here's
our comparison to AMD and how we're
becoming more price competitive with
them which we didn't really see very
much of here so how did you feel about
the 99 80 X YZ benchmarks they showed us
what maya game-like compiling and
premiere or something now were you were
you looking for more there I was looking
for more I think we were sitting next to
each other and I mentioned it seems like
all of the stuff that they're testing
the 2990 W X and comparing it to their
current their new 18 core is the stuff
that the 2990 W X is the worst at like
premiere game performance is really bad
on the 2990 W X because the latency
between all the cores so it's not really
the best comparison there but it does
seem interesting that there it seems
like there's an emerging third market
for the CPU space right now there's the
really high
core count stuff really CPU intensive
stuff there's sort of the mid-range that
they're trying to pitch it like the
creator slash gamer where it's like it's
got your good gaming performance but
also high core count for video render
rendering and that kind of thing and
then of course the mainstream stuff
that's like strictly just for gaming or
maybe your gaming and streaming so I
think it'll be interesting to see how
that plays out I guess over the next
year or so yeah so as I said before
channels link below that's Paul from
Paul's hardware and I guess we'll we'll
revisit the overclocking battle
potentially with this one as well yeah
we gotta get the ninety that way ninety
nine eighty nine ninety nine eight exe
or an eighty XE and overclocked that and
beat our scores yes alright check that
out below will get Joker up next okay so
now we've got Joe key here from Joker
productions also on YouTube and Joker
same question what you think of the
event any any Goods and goods and Bad's
well I was trying to find the water
chiller off stage somewhere but it
seemed like they were actually running
the twenty eight core just on a normal
liquid cooler but I will continue my
investigation as I'm going around the
area a lot of these desk seems to be
open but some are closed so might be
tucked away underneath somewhere it
could be tucked away somewhere like
other things are tough never mind but so
I'm excited for the i9 you know eight
cores and everything like that
hopefully seem at five gigahertz
depending on how well they overclock I
was a little a little miffed about the
removal of hyper-threading though on the
i7 it seems kind of weird that they are
choosing to segment it that way rather
than cores it would have seemed to be
make more sense for the i7 to continue
being six cores with twelve threads and
then at the i-5 six four six threads I
thought that would have made a lot more
sense than making eight cores eight
threads because there's really no reason
to pick one up over an 8700 K depending
on you know what the performance
actually I would agree with that that
was not decision yeah I mean you know
even though they're not physical cores
having 12 threads is still going to be
better in multi-threaded workloads
traditionally if you're doing rendering
or streaming or whatever it's going to
help you out more than just having the
physical cores right definitely any
anything what about the 18 core part
have any any thoughts there I still want
to know how it's running on on all of
course one stare boat I hear the you
were curious about that as well yes so I
we'll have an update to this in the
article by now but I asked several times
what is the all-court frequency are you
not going to answer the question and
after the event someone came over and
answered the question and so the answer
was the single core frequency for the 18
core part is 4.7 gigahertz and the all
core frequency is 3.8 gigahertz so that
was the answer that we could not get
significantly lower basically yeah but
not low enough to shy away from it so I
think someone just genuinely didn't know
the answer something to that effect and
my question for you now is do you plan
on taking one of these and overclocking
it and then putting Paul and J resting
in peace again and re overclocking and
trying to get a better time for twying
streams great but you can are you gonna
beat them further you're gonna just keep
digging are you gonna get your Bower you
can only kick a man when he's down so
much okay
I have more else and also with them
doing the solder Tim now they pretty
much kind of killed the D living
business overnight right like I mean cut
people like Durbar who make d living
tools pretty much killing that business
right now yeah I'm not sure what's gonna
happen to that I talked to Roman before
about that at Computex and he said he'd
personally prefer solder anyway because
it makes his overclocking life easier
but it is a market that thighs sure
that's that's kind of sad but Joker's
channel below if you want to check him
out thank you for joining me - to all
the youtubers here and I'm gonna see if
I can get Gordon on camera as well so
now I'm here with Gordon from PC world
Gordon joined us previously at after
packs after that panel and Gordon same
question for you as everyone else what
do you think's good what are you
concerned about what he excited about
you mean the good news is obviously
there's a sale on thermal interface
material Intel's got like a truckload of
solder they're all soldered everything
soldered so that's good news I do want
to say one thing to the community who
have for years and years and years who
pseudo where's my pace - oh it's just
paste Tim where's the solder where you
got hotter now so you can't complain
about them giving you solder so I just
want to make sure people got that
straight solder they get Sauter's back
you can't now ding someone for giving
what you've asked for pricing is gonna
be issue right I think it's interesting
you know Intel made this claim that it's
a world best gaming processor I know a
lot of AMD fans they're gonna be all
pissy about that but let's
87 decay had the higher clocks 9900 kay
he's got the higher clocks they're gonna
probably hold that position and I think
he tells like hey you want cores and you
want high clocks you're gonna have to
pay a couple hundred bucks 100 extra
bucks for it I think there's people that
will do it they don't have a problem
with that because Intel plus higher
clocks they will do it but yeah it's for
a lot of people they're gonna say hey 27
Derek's with the cooler s my you know
it's better for me but I do think
there's some concern for that I am still
trying to sort out the core X parts
which are the skylake X parts with
basically take sky like X with paste
imput in solder Tim higher clocks better
part so I think it'll be a better part
overall I'm you know there were those
those power issues with overclocking I
don't think that's gonna go away
necessarily so there are gonna be
problems that but I think it's it's a
good sign because overall Intel is it's
a big ship it's moving back into what
everybody's been asking for so we'll see
how it plays out and of course that 28
core part is you know interesting we
don't have a price on it who knows but
it's just there to make sure they can
say their first I like to say companies
like to have moral high-ground
into us like to have the moral high
ground even though they don't they're
not a better deal for consumers they
want they don't really care about that
they want to care about we have more
performance which manager I'm gonna try
to look at the camera Steve says people
don't look at the camera I'm gonna count
but yeah yeah I mean you know overall
it's a it's a good it's a good thing I I
kind of wish they would compete on price
as somebody who likes cheaper things I
don't think Intel wants to put go there
because I mean probably what would
happened is Intel would go to 350 on the
9900 K and then AMD all great that's
nice we're cutting 27 you're next to
$200 right and it's like Intel doesn't
want to chase AMD all the way down there
they they like money that I have to pay
for all these fabs so--but overall it's
still a good thing we'll have to see how
everything stacks up and actual
performance you know for the most part
so and you know it's it's good its
overall it's good right how could you
say anything negative except for the B
book oh why didn't you do soda before
until those people well it's here now
you're complaining about the solder well
see well see how it does
and of course now people are gonna
complain that they can't deal with it
anymore right you can't win you can't
win you just you can't win it would be
like oh yeah right you're because people
say like why can't it's too hard time
breaking it cuz I went to well then just
go with that don't need to deal in it
then but then I don't know I uh you know
Saunders back it's good you've been
asking for four years I think we all
have been saying it's good but you know
good point uh there I was talking to
them about earlier like hey you know
what devil's canyon we use that that was
just stuff we got at Radio Shack right
they work fine so it wasn't in fact they
call it something else but it was not
but I mean clearly you could do hi
clocks with with the the pace before but
yeah solder is better so I guess good
it's good it's good pricing not good
solder good pricing twenty-eight core
leases here it's gonna come out in its
year so it'll be I'm surprised they're
not using car nine though but that'll be
interesting yeah I am so that's that's
Gordon from PC R oh wait wait last thing
though last thing do you think Steve
they were throwing shade at AMD because
it's like oh look cuz we had go to this
big socket for six channels of memory
you need more memory bandwidth you have
a lot of course I think that memory
bandwidth is gonna be a problem for
third or at the high end maybe you've
done more threader for to testing that I
have at this point so you would you
would know better but I think for sure
there was there were some comparisons to
Andy but and they did say we benchmarked
the other guys too right but most of
those comparisons were things that Andy
is just really not good at and everyone
knows that and of course I am T does
mostly the same thing as well I'll give
AMD some credit lately when they've
shown gaming benchmarks they do actually
show us when they lose sometimes like
they'll say we're negative seven percent
but they never say we're negative like
thirty percent right so yeah that's true
I mean yeah it's nice to see people
being a little more honest but they
always tend to show when they're doing
better premiere is interesting they're
saying that was a memory bandwidth
workload so I guess we'll see when we
get all these parts but definitely I
think it's it's going to be an issue for
a third over I mean it'll seem like
feels like we'll get the Ripper 2:32
core for high compute tasks things
worried memory bandwidth matters you got
to go to the Zeon part right so we'll
see right and also frequency of course
yeah and frequencies so yeah that's two
out of I it's you know but then this can
be cost too because we don't know what
the cost of this part is and if they
since the eighteen core core i9 where
the ninth gen Cora nine is still two
grand where do they come in on that yeah
I don't know I mean there I guess
there's a rumor of $5,000 on that but
that's you know yeah it's a rumor but
yeah that price is probably the least
the least rigid part of any spec sheet
right that's that's the one they can
change the easiest see right yeah so
check out PC world for sure they have a
podcast on the YouTube that I was on
previously and they've got the website
of course PC world calm Thank You Gordon
for joining me thanks so now I have Rob
Williams from tech gage here if you
don't know who Rob is rob has a it's a
website tech age calm and you started
doing YouTube recently too right yes yes
I have so Rob does some of the the bests
I guess workstation testing I've seen in
the space definitely check them out if
you're interested in that and has a
unique perspective for this then so same
questions everyone else what'd you think
was good what do you think was bad any
anything you're excited about or
concerned about hmm
for one thing I'm really happy about the
new 9900 Kay I think it's a cool
processor because it's the fastest all
core turbo how can you not like that
eight core is gonna be good for
well-rounded consumers high-end
enthusiasts even who don't need the
high-end the x-series or whatever so and
they're using good Tim now so I mean
that's one of the biggest things take
aways from this for sure and just just
to clarify for the audience
Tim is just thermal interface material
which you all know of course but it
doesn't mean thermal paste a lot of
people get that mixed up so solder is
still Tim and they're using solder so
soldered Tim yeah
what did anything anything that you were
concerned about annoyed with yes I don't
understand why the 9700 K was increased
in price while hyper threading was
removed we got two extra cores right
still an a thread processor so they
increased the price and yeah
just to differentiate
from the 9900 K I don't really like that
too much they shouldn't have downgraded
it as far as I'm concerned yeah yeah I
would agree with that it's it's an
unnecessary level product segmentation
so how about on the high end it's still
I guess it's all sky like X right yes
any any thoughts on that part I don't
know it's what we're given we can't
really do anything about it right so I
mean we can be happy that they're
putting good thermal interface material
in there now because I mean the 16 corn
18 core last gen right the X series when
you ran in avx-512 test they got so hot
so hot so I'm just looking forward to
actually less less temperatures
especially for such a beefy core chip
yeah definitely so that's Rob from tech
age will have his link below as well so
now we've got Marco Chiappetta from hot
hardware hardware does a lot of news
reporting they also have a YouTube
channel linked them below to Marco's
same question for you as everyone else
what do you think's good what do you
think's bad anything you're excited
about yeah so I think there's lots of
good stuff first I'm happy that there is
some a fire under Intel and we're seeing
lots of new enthusiasts targeted stuff
everything from the enthusiasts
standpoint except for maybe pricing
looks good you know you have a higher
frequencies better gaming performance
and new products for creators as well so
you get those really many core
processors there's lots of variety to
choose from there are some things to be
concerned with pricing is one thing to
be worried about some of the higher-end
parts you know they're being billed as
new processors but it's still skylake X
so with higher frequencies there's
potential for some serious power
consumption there hopefully those slider
Tim's help with temps but we'll see how
it all plays out when we test them you
know yeah any any thoughts on the said
they listed TDPS as always 95 watt for
the 900 k I think is what it said I
indeed any any thoughts on that you
think that's a valid measurement of
anything so the 99 hundred K is a new
chip so until we test it it's really I'm
gonna have to take Intel at their word I
think power is going to be okay on the
99 hundred K you know they've had time
to tweak their process it is it's not
it's not new core technology but it is a
new piece of silicon so I think that's
going to be alright the other chips I
think is questionable you
getting higher frequencies out of a 28
courtship it's gonna use a lot of power
there's just just there's no cheating
the laws of physics it's how it's gonna
be
you know just despite Intel literally
saying we had to break the laws of
physics to bring you these parts which
gotta say is probably not what happened
but it's okay to say they think it's
fast any I don't know anything you think
about what about the 1980 XE the 18 core
high end part any specific thoughts
there until I tested I'm not gonna draw
any conclusions I think it's gonna be
you know if you're familiar with the 79
80 XE I don't think it's gonna be a
world of difference from there I think
you obviously you're gonna have higher
overall perfect because it frequencies
better overclocking and thermals because
of the new Tim I think I'm sort of
excited from a technology standpoint for
that unlock Xeon I know that's going to
be super power-hungry but having an
unlocked crazy high-end Xeon to compete
with the 2990 WX that's going to be fun
to play with I know the value crop is
probably not there for most people but
it's gonna be really cool to bench
market and overclock it and see what it
does you're gonna need a ton of cooling
obviously but I'm happy to see Intel
doing that at least you know if AMD
didn't get back on the ball the last
couple years I don't think we'd see
basically any of this stuff so I think
it's cool that it's happening as a
longtime enthusiast you know how hard
we're going on 20 years it's great to
see this stuff coming again and to see
sort of some excitement in the
enthusiasts desktop space absolutely so
as I said link below for a hot Hardware
they've got a YouTube channel and a
website and thank you for joining me
Marco so now we have Jeff Kampmann here
from tech report calm and tech report of
course we have a lot of respect for I've
mentioned them a lot in the past Scott
Watson founded it and Jeff is now is it
editor-in-chief is that the correct
title that's right so we've got a Jeff
from tech report same question for you
as everyone else going through the event
where do you want to start with
mainstream you want to start with a EDT
let's start with mainstream so the i9
9900 k obviously is the part that
everybody has wanted it's a skylight
course at 16 threads with Intel's latest
process technology and solder Tim
and that right there if you know where
Intel has been kind of behind AMD in the
past couple years is you know that's
what everybody wanted it's just I you
know I have all the respect for being
able to deliver the chip and put you
know liquid metal under there but I
don't want to bother with it I just want
to put it in the socket and go and with
the ninth-generation chips you can do
that now and great
so they've accomplished that goal yeah
because I don't want I don't like my lab
I don't like loud pcs and I being able
to cool the chip effectively is just as
important as being able to get the best
performance out of it so also the all
core clock speed on the 9900 K I believe
is 4.7 gigahertz it almost obviates the
need to overclock and that's it's just
gonna be a really awesome part but it's
really expensive too so I mean it's sort
of bridging high-end desktop and
mainstream so as for the rest of the
parts the the i-5 is still six core six
threads
probably won't be a major advance over
the eighty six hundred K the 9700 K is
going to be more attainable I think in
terms of pricing and we're just gonna
have to see how to move from six cores
and twelve threads to eight cores
without hyper threading effects lineup
but overall I'm really impressed I have
a z3 90 motherboards at home they've got
meaningful improvements to the VR MVR
I'm cooling and I can't wait to get a
chip in there and let it rip so yeah
yeah I agreed what about a h EDT side so
there's there's be no chips in there
prices that it looks like they've
shifted a little bit I think so
the I wasn't actually expecting X 299
refresh but it looks like that's what
we're getting today and so they've
dropped the six core chip which is
necessary and you know nobody was buying
7800 X's at this point so now the
entry-level is eight cores and 16
threads with quad channel memory and the
same solder Tim and again none of my
skylake X chips were limited by the chip
they were limited by the thermal
interface material
it's really it's really great now that
we can probably take those chips to
their full potential because they from
watching your videos we know that they
have more in them than what we're
getting today and so I'm again those
those launch next month I think and I'm
really really excited to see like what
those can do now that they're not like
constrained thermally I would say gimped
but in I think Intel has made meaningful
improvements to the platform as well
having forty four I think
Intel says up to sixty eight PCIe lanes
for the platform on all of its parts now
which presumably means that they're
gonna use they're gonna stop segmenting
they're gonna stop making 28 Lane and 44
Lane parts and that was another major
point of concern I really really hate
writing about motherboards where I have
to be like well you put this CPU in
there and then you put this CPU in there
and it does this that and the other it's
just like x3 99 from AMD was refreshing
because you don't have to think it just
you what you see is what you get and I
think that's really what high-end
desktop builders want and aside from the
small changes at the bottom of the stack
there are now 2/10 core CPUs one
slightly less good and one that's about
as good as the I 970 900 X all of them
have four point five gigahertz peak
turbo boost max 3.0 speeds yeah I mean
so I think it's a really good response
they have it really balanced lineup now
if you can afford to pay for it and
that's again the theme here is just
they're maintaining the premium
positioning and they can probably
justify it so yeah I think it's
meaningful but we'll have to test and
see and then yeah you want to talk about
the where we think of 3175
or yeah sure what do you think so at the
top line up the 28 core part that we saw
at Computex is now official and it's
called the CM w 31 75 X the motherboards
are ridiculous the cooling is probably
going to have to be ridiculous but I
think for people who were
you for caught people for whom cost is
no object and time is money I think
that's gonna be a really interesting
part but it's gonna you know I'm just
intimidated by the motherboards and the
power requirements and oh boy I might
have to be upgrading my the circuits in
my office to handle the demands of an
overclocked 3175 ax but hey it's a Z on
that you might be able to buy for less
than $10,000 and put in a motherboard
and actually used in a PC and it's hard
not to be excited about that so yeah so
it's yeah I think it's been a big day
for Intel I think this is a real they're
really responding to what the new
competition in the marketplace well it's
