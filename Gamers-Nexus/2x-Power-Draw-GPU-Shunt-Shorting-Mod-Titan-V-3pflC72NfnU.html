we're trying it first on a three
thousand dollar card the Titan V the
idea of this mod is to help reduce the
power restriction that we're facing with
the card and Vidya has shunts that are
inline and those help determine how much
power is being drawn so if we can trick
the card the GPU into thinking it is
drawing lower power than it actually is
that will give us more power Headroom
for overclocking and for maintaining
higher clocks for longer periods of time
this will help us in our endeavors to
hold the top slots on time spy extreme
or whatever until the real overclockers
get their hands on cards and it'll be a
good learning experience so we can show
how you can find shunts and what the
process of shorting them does this video
is brought to you by the gamers Nexus
anti-static mod mat our mod mat uses a
high quality anti-static surface with a
rubberized finish we also have a custom
paint job on it which includes reference
points and cheat sheets for PCIe eps 12
volt and other power cables along with
quick reference throne paste application
guides a screw sorter for your video
card tear downs and it includes a common
ground point and a grounding strap to
help protect the products you are
working on from electrostatic discharge
preorder your mat now at the link in the
description below so starting at the
very basics the shunt resistor exists so
that Nvidia can figure out how much
power is being supplied to the GPU at
any given time which allows them to then
determine at what point it's time to
start power throttling the GPU we have
removed the thermal throttle scenario by
modding the card to have a liquid cooler
on it there are three primary candidates
for clock drops or clock monitoring or
mitigation on NVIDIA it's thermals we've
resolved that it's voltage and then its
power the last you kind of go
hand-in-hand so to figure out how much
power is going to the GPU and Vidya is
putting an inline shunt resistor which
has a known voltage going into it 12
volts coming from the PCIe connectors
and it has a known resistance in this
case five milli ohms if you look at the
components it's written right on
so what they need to know is the current
and they can figure that out from all
the other numbers that we've laid out so
then if we short the shunts with liquid
metal we are basically tricking the GPU
into thinking it's pulling less power
than it is there are components on the
board like the AI na 3 2 2 1 which we
can highlight over on this side of the
board so this thing right here is the AI
na 3 2 2 1
this device is responsible for
monitoring the voltage drop across the
shunt resistors this is a shunt resistor
there are several of them on the card so
what happens is when the AI na 3 2:21
detects that we are starting to near the
power limit it's going to send the
signals required to start power
throttling the clock we're going to have
lower core clocks as a result and that's
what we're trying to fix so point out
the shunts that we have we've got this
one over here the suspicion is that this
links up to this 8 pin connector and I'm
going to show you how we can prove that
just to be safe there's this one over
here this shunt also 5 milli ohms we
think talks to the 6 pin by way of
proximity there's another shunt this one
we know talks to the PCIe slot and then
finally there's mystery shunt
over here and we're not sure what this
goes to and then we're going to short
these two exclusively to try and trick
the GPU to a point of thinking that it's
facing less resistance maybe increase
our power budget a little bit by doing
so so let's start off by making sure
that the shunts are the correct ones if
you're ever planning to do a shunt mod
on an expensive card and you find a
tutorial on the Internet whether it
comes from us build Zoid or so on random
you should probably double check to make
sure the information is accurate you can
do this by taking a cheap digital
multimeter or voltmeter and what we're
gonna do is measure to determine which
shunt is in the power line for which
power connector so let's just go ahead
and start with a scenario that we think
will will not work so what we're looking
for we're measuring resistance so you
switch into ohms so measuring resistance
between the the power line which is
going to be actually we have our our GN
mod mat over here showing its usefulness
already so this is a plug it really
quickly if you got a store that gamers
Nexus dotnet slash mod mat you can pick
one of these up we have them on
pre-order now they're anti-static as
well but it has this handy chart on it
so we have an 8 pin and a 6 pin and what
we need to do is measure the 12 volt
lines from each against the shot you can
measure either side of the shunt versus
any of these yellow pins on our mat if
and I can demonstrate this if you
measure this pin the extra cents pin
actually right here cents B if you
measure this cents pin it's not gonna
work it'll give you an invalid value if
you measure any of the ground pins same
thing so we need only the yellow and
those are our 12 volt lines the reason
we need these is because this 12 volt
line is going to have the shunt in line
with it so if we are measuring
resistance from the shunt to the correct
12 volt line we should see zero ohms or
very close to it zero resistance if
we're measuring incorrectly or to the
incorrect line or to a ground you'll see
an increasing number over time a nonzero
number we'll call it okay so we already
know where we think each one goes to I
think this goes to eight this goes to
six I'm gonna measure them to the
opposite of what I think just to make a
point so we can measure either side of
the shunt resistor again so let's just
choose the sense pin so again
referencing our mat this far right pin
is a green pin it's sense it is not
voltage so we're going to measure that
verse is the shunt resistor and we
should get an increasing value over time
a non zero value as you can see that
number is increasing right now if we
measure it versus the ground or the
black on the mod mat you can see that is
an increasing nonzero value so then if
we measure it against a 12 volt line
we're gonna see either a zero value or
nonzero let's measure
first against the 8-pin that should be
nonzero and it is so you can see that
numbers going up so it this is not this
shunt resistor is not in mine with that
power connector let's measure against
the six pin all three of the bottom row
are 12 volt referencing our mod mat so
we can point out one of those I mean you
get a zero value now it will
occasionally increase a little bit
because it is one a cheap meter and two
it's refreshing its measurements
regularly but whenever we kind of back
off and go back on to check we're gonna
get a zero value or extremely close to
it
so this shunt then is in line with that
six pin because we're getting basically
zero values every time we check next
thing to do is check this shunt
so we've now has determined that this is
goes to here this goes to here so we can
short these two so here's the safety
disclaimer liquid metal contains gallium
gallium could potentially react poorly
with ten solder contains ten these shunt
resistors are soldered to the PCB with a
ten solder
if we put a gallium liquid metal on the
top of it it is possible that if we
don't protect the solder you could over
time have a reaction that causes the
liquid metal to eat the solder and your
shunt will fall off the card so that's
your disclaimer we are only doing this
mod for benchmarking and it will be very
brief we're not leaving this for months
at a time I'm not recommending that you
do it it's at your own risk so we should
be fine but I wanted to point that out
so to prevent any issues there you can
use a nail polish around the perimeter
you can use a liquid tape you can use
electrical tape there's all kinds of
options we're gonna put a very thin
layer on here and just make sure we're
protecting any components that are
neighboring to prevent the liquid metal
from shorting those while we are also
shorting the shunt so it's just kind of
paint over those now part of this
process is building like I said a wall
or a moat or a well around the resistor
per take you
below it we're gonna have this vertical
and a bench that means if liquid metal
drips off it's gonna drip down so this
we're gonna use thermal grisly conduct a
knot and I have actually some liquid
metal that is still still on the q-tip
from originally using it like a month
ago which goes to show that this stuff
doesn't actually just evaporate over a
period of a month like some people say
online so we're gonna use whatever's on
there and if I need more I'll add it and
trying to be very precise here this can
be removed with rubbing alcohol pretty
easily cotton ball also is very helpful
in removal and we just need to bridge
each side of the shunt to the other side
as always with liquid metal the key is
to use as little as possible
especially when we're concerned about
solder joints and solder health of the
ten underneath it so we don't want any
excess that'll drip down and cause
damage and this you'll notice it doesn't
have any liquidy look to it actually
looks like it's going on more like a
paint than anything right now like a
paint pen almost so if we get kind of a
zoom on that painted over shunt you can
kind of look at the other ones around
for comparison there's no pool of liquid
metal here obviously you're gonna want
to watch multiple sources if you're
really doing this rather than just take
it only from me but I think you'll be
able to get an idea of what it looks
like from a first-time perspective while
also hopefully understanding why we're
doing it so that should be okay at this
point you can still see the five million
text on it for the most part so it's not
too thick of a layer if it doesn't work
I'll put more on there and at this point
what you need to know is what happens
next so next we're going to clamp the
twelve volt on each so we've got six
cables to clamp and they're gonna be the
lines closest to the back of the card
where the backplate would be so that
would be
this bottom row down here is what we are
clamping so we've got one two three four
five six and this is a sense pen we
don't want it so we're clamping these
six connectors and that will tell us
power consumption the next part is to
run a test that has a known power
consumption for us we can use x bi or
firestrike and then we compare those
numbers to the numbers with the shunt
mod not applied with the cardstock and
if in fact we are seeing higher current
going into the card through PCIe that
means that it worked because that's all
of that happens before it ever hits the
PCB so the shunts aren't doing anything
yet and we're measuring only input
current what's happening over here is
the GPU is being tricked into thinking
that it has it's actually able to pull
that extra current through the headers
because it thinks that it's running at a
lower wattage than it is which is again
just P equals VI calculation so that's
what we're testing okay excuse the set
layout changed it's been a few days we
did some more testing on it so for the
card we had up making a few changes from
what was done in the first half of this
video the main ones are that the third
mystery shunt which builds I'd had
initially said until we can figure out
what it does leave it alone we end up
shorting that one anyway we needed to so
the first round of shorted testing done
with the modded version that you saw
leading up to this point did not really
work it didn't do anything bad but we
weren't when we tested the frequency and
the current it wasn't any different at
all really
than a reference card we're talking
tenths of an amp difference within error
well with an error so it didn't work so
the next step was to apply some liquid
metal to the third shunt and did a quick
multimeter check of that one to checking
the resistance and found that it aligned
to both eight pins the empty eight pin
and the wired existing eight pin that's
on the card so the third
Gault's is two shots go to that eight
pin connector so we shorted that one as
well and started to see a bit of a
difference it was maybe one to two amps
getting to be enough of a current
difference where your 1020 watts more
than you used to be pulling through the
cables that's still not a lot it doesn't
really change anything the frequency
looks about the same so after some
consultation with build Zoid and others
we found that the amount of liquid metal
you apply to the shunt directly impacts
how much you are bypassing that
5,000,000 resistance per shunt resistor
so the reason for that is well there's
so there's two things consider one is
the more liquid metal you apply you
start encountering two issues one is
that it can drip and cause damage or
short things on the card the other
concern is that it can start eating
through the solder around the edges of
the shunt resistor if there's a lot of
it that's kind of dripping over the
edges of the shunt or just you leave it
there for long enough that it will start
eating through what's what's on there
for the solder for the 10 so that's a
concern we apply just a little bit more
what we'll call a medium amount of
liquid metal it's basically it's not
quite a pool of liquid metal but it's a
it's another layer to the surface that
started showing real impact and then we
did a bit more than that what we called
heavy but it still wasn't a pool of
liquid metal and that allowed us to go
from something like 18 amps to at the
high 32 amps it's a big difference there
a major difference nearly double getting
towards it so it works we finally were
able to get a shunt mods work we're
gonna go through the data now on some
very quick fire strike scores using our
game bench this is different from our X
299 bench that we used for the the top
10 record attempt we'll talk about that
more later but we're starting with the
game bench to establish a baseline of
what kind of frequency difference we saw
and what kind of current difference /
power consumption difference we saw
let's start with some fire strikes
scoring just to establish the gains were
seeing and we'll move on to frequency
and power next with fire strike ultra
our first shunt mod attempt had us going
roughly the same as our normal hybrid
card without the shunt mod the
differences were within variance
and error so non-existent and again
after consulting build Zoid and several
dare bower videos on this we decided to
short the third shunt which got roughly
the same results initially but after we
added more liquid metal we finally
started seeing change with a medium
application of liquid metal a bit more
than what we showed in the earlier half
of this video but not yet a giant pool
of it we were able to achieve a constant
score uplift of about 0.7 percent it's
not much but it was consistent
repeatable and was enough to show that
we were on to something
adding up more liquid metal helped we
boosted up to 95 18 points equating a 3
FPS gain if you were to convert it over
the non shortage shunts and the result
is a boost of about 2.7 percent that's
enough to start budging our score is
higher for firestrike competitive
overclock and a testing or Hardware
bought scores things like that if you're
shooting for higher ranks and
overclocking is worth considering
it's not really worth much for actual
gaming but that's just something you can
see in our sniper elite scores which
we'll throw on the screen now as you can
see what something like Sniper Elite an
actual video game that even leverages
the extra clock stability more than most
games would the games still aren't
gigantic it's something it's enough to
prove that it works but not really
enough to do as a normal gaming upgrade
you really want this for more
competitive workloads we saw less
scaling with fire strike extreme
expectedly it starts becoming a CPU
bench at that point but we'll look to
our ex 299 bench momentarily for bigger
gains what's more interesting is that
the shunt mod provided enough power to
our GPU to complete the times by
benchmark previously without these
shunts shorted we had issues with times
by crashing under this plus 200
megahertz offset overclocked for the
core and the HBM we could not complete
the benchmark without reducing our clock
offset or increasing liquid metal on the
shunt resistors and here's why we're
seeing those gains this chart is a
frequency versus time chart you'll
notice that most tests like the
benchmarks without shunt shorting have
some fluctuation and dithering between
clock frequencies although we can hit
peaks of two thousand twenty thirty two
megahertz
the clock won't hold those and we'll
spend a lot of time ramping up and down
based on boost for
amateurs we've mostly solved for
thermals and are operating at a steady
state temperature at this point
so our limiter is power the heavily
shorted shunts show a nearly flatlined
frequency which is exactly what you want
notice that the frequency isn't any
higher than the previous Peaks but is
holding completely steady at nearly a
perfect twenty seventeen megahertz this
studying is similar to what existed
during Boost 2.0 era is what contributes
to our boosted scores the clock is
holding rather than bouncing between
2032 and 1900 and so we get higher
scores as a result out of fire strike
and here's a look at wattage down the
PCIe cables as a reminder power is equal
to current times voltage so we're
pushing up to 33 amps in some situations
where we previously were stuck to about
eighteen to nineteen amps with a twelve
point three volt rail that puts us at
406 Watts peak down the PCIe cables
versus the previous maximum of about 234
Watts that is a massive difference and
is starting to exit what well is way out
of range or what the card was designed
for but it can handle it as long as you
have cooling on the BRM so this does not
account for PCIe slot power so there's a
bit more power being drawn there but we
didn't short that shunt
so it remains baseline from before the
chunk mod and for anyone worried about
the V around temperatures we had that
covered as in our live stream of taking
the top ten slot one of them we had a
120 millimeter Corsair maglev fan
blastema left half of the BRM a be quiet
fan blasting from the top and a knock to
a fan from the right side on the back of
the PCB where we were able to cool the
right half of the vrm plus the
controller not only were the FETs
operating within range they were
operating cooler than the stock card was
because of direct air flow it matters
more than just a heatsink and finally
here's a couple graphic scores from the
X 299 bench with one of our fire strike
runs we've improved a bit here as well
it would help pump us higher on the
hardware bot score charts if we want to
play around with those again in the
future at least for now until the other
overclockers get their hands on the
Titan V's and give us us an idea of how
the improvements scale across a
different platform so that's it for this
one it's pretty cool the thing here to
take away is that this would work on any
pass
gal card so this applies to a 1080 tea I
just as much as it does to it 1062 a
Titan V same idea the difference of
course is when is it worth it and
probably not very often for most of you
that the risks can potentially outweigh
pretty heavily the gains you're looking
at you can get better gains than we did
I think from what I've heard from their
Bower and from Build Zoid there's
potential for better gains but this is
not a mod that increases your overclock
offset in any meaningful way for the
most part it's a mod that stabilizes the
clock so that it does not choke on the
power consumption to running the same
high clocks it's just it flatlines
instead of jumping around that's what
improves your performance so it doesn't
give you a ton of headroom that by
nature of the mod but it gives you
enough that if you're competing for
overclocked scores or something like
that it would be worth doing
I wouldn't recommend this for a 24/7
gaming machine certainly people do it
their Bower himself has talked about
having 1080s setup for half a year at a
time at least with the liquid metal
shunt mod but he's not like every user
so generally speaking I don't know that
I could in good faith recommend the mod
just because it's if you're not
experienced with liquid metal which
we've got experience for all the D lids
it's easy to screw up and depend on the
orientation of the card if you do a
vertical GPU mount for example you're
fighting gravity now so depending on how
strong your fans are if you move the
system around if it gets bumped or just
time it's possible that you could have
some drip that would short other
components it's also possible that you
could apply too much or too little and
either it does damages the card it does
nothing it might just short it and stop
it from booting at which point you clean
it off and you're fine there's a lot of
different things here and the point
isn't the scare you away from doing it
it's just to say that make sure you
understand why you want to do the mod
and then be careful and you should be
fine if you're careful about it don't
rush it and be patient with the
application and all that stuff make sure
you test thoroughly and it should be
fine it's just I
no that is worth it for gaming but it's
worth it to get higher scores if that's
what you're going for so there's nothing
wrong with that so that's all for this
one as always if you wanna helps out
directly you can pick up the mod mat
that we used in the first half of the
video this one on store like Aaron's
Nexus dotnet slash mod mat it's up for
pre-order now or you can go to store it
