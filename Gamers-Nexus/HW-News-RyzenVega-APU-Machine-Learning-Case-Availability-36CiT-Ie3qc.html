hardware news recap talking about some
of the news in the industry for the past
week there's not a ton of it because it
seemed like there were just more follow
ups on launch products and things like
that that said there's an AMD update to
EFI coming out soon another geesa update
a gsa and that's gonna be version one
thousand seven one zero zero seven and
rise in AP use in HP notebooks we're
also sort of leaked accidentally by HP
so that's also kind of interesting in
that couple of cases some cooler stuff
and silicon lottery stuff and that'll
wrap up the news so let's get to it
this video is brought to you by the be
quiet dark bass pro 900 white edition
the DB p nine hundred marks a return to
full tower cases equipped with ample
harddrive support effective at noise
damping foam high performance fans and
the option to be inverted into an
alternative layout learn more at the
link in the description below first of
just to address some questions we've
gotten following all of the AMD vega
coverage people are still asking
rightfully so where are the vega partner
cards basically was a reference launched
and it's remained reference pretty much
since launch so the answer is this the
manufacturers we've spoken with are
still waiting on am d for sufficient
supplies of ship and part of this comes
down to how the channel works where
retailers distributors so forth
basically want some guarantee that they
will have a restock date firmly so if
they get however many hundreds of units
from a board partner they want to know
that in x weeks will get another couple
hundred units or another couple dozen
units whatever is the volume maybe and
right now the manufacturers we've spoken
with are still basically stocking up
trying to make sure they can get enough
Vega parts in to build their boards
build the cards and send a massive
distributors so still waiting on that I
do not have a firm date for you I know
that it keeps getting kind of pushed
back slowly so we'll see as for why the
supply is so limited I don't have an
answer on the
so it could be a couple of things one of
them is difficulty to manufacture one of
them is cost and potentially losing
money on some of the GPUs like 56 as we
showed previously and then of course
things like other projects for example
the Apple projects how much of supply is
that taking versus how much supply is
some of the higher-end compute stuff
taking things like that so we don't have
all the answers for you the only answer
I have right now is that the reason
there are no partner cards for Vega yet
is because of inventory and availability
and because AIB partners simply can't
get enough of it from AMD to meet their
supply demands that they need to meet to
satisfy their other partners in the
channel distributors retailers all of
them so hopefully that answers that it's
not a great answer because I wish I
could say like you'll be able to buy
these cards soon we're trying to review
the ACS tricks by the way you've seen
our PCB and vrm analysis of it builds oh
I did that and our teardown of it and
I'm still waiting on performance
benchmarks but all the thermocouples on
it today actually
but unfortunately until I'm cleared for
by ACS for V bios I'm kind of stuck so
asus is still trying to finalize their v
bios and get it working with and these
continually updating drivers apparently
that's causing some headaches and that's
why we are on hold but once the thing
actually has functional v bios and
drivers will test it or if it becomes
retail available then we'll test it but
until that point there's no point
because it just it's just gonna be data
that's representative of an unfinished
product so we're still on hold
let sorry about this AMD update for the
cpu side so this is a Raven Ridge update
and also links to ASIS with Elmore who's
an overclocker and and works with asus
on the motherboard side of things and on
overclock net a Lamar stated agiza 1007
comes with support for Raven Ridge ap
use and he has also changed the entire
BIOS base structure so we have to do a
lot of work to
to everything to the new version which
may result in further bugs the advantage
is that it makes it easier to support
future CPUs parenthetically Raven Ridge
or Pinnacle Ridge the cold boot fix will
be implemented as soon as we have a
recent agiza version which supports it
so basically laying the foundation for
the future and the CPUs Raven Ridge
being the AP that will theoretically
include Vega and then pinnacle Ridge
being the next immediate refresh of
Rison and our last bit of AM D news for
this week the rise in AP was also
spotted in HP data tables for their new
laptops that HP inadvertently posted on
their own website later removing those
data tables video cards captured a
screenshot of this of course and it's
the HP Envy x-360 two-in-one notebook
which has also been taken offline since
and its including an ante rise in five
twenty five hundred u quad-core we're
not clear on if it's four and eight or
just four and four for core and thread
counts that operates at two gigahertz
base three point six gigahertz boost and
has six megabytes of cache also
interestingly the graphics section for
the laptop lists I quote integrated AMD
Radeon Vega M graphics as the solution
marking the first semi-official
appearance of it and AMD Vega
integration in a notebook so this is
it's it's looking an interesting because
in terms of power you should be around
low-end discrete GPU performance and
it's going to come down to kind of RAM
speeds and how smart these manufacturers
are about the memory that they include
in the notebooks because a lot of
notebooks out there today including the
initial admittedly unfine I expect table
for this one have a single stick of
memory and the place that most
definitely has impact is ap use or iGPS
because you end up accessing system
memory to handle all of what would
normally be done on video memory
and having decreased bandwidth in that
department is not going to be good so
hopefully the manufacturers are smart
enough to to step up the game with
memory speeds so that people don't just
think that the GPUs are bad because
they're choking on memory bandwidth
which Vega is very bandwidth intensive
and going with a single stick of slower
memory is not going to work out well
maybe Andy will put some restrictions or
requirements in there but either way
it's made an appearance now we're just
kind of waiting for the product to show
up properly for anyone seeking coffee
lake stock it's still limited
just like Vega is limited and much the
way Vega launched with zero inventory
teams coffee like kind of followed that
trend which is very disappointing to see
from two major product launches this
year but that's the way it goes I guess
the retailer silicon lottery has listed
its deleted I 380 350 case for sale so
there's some inventory out there the i3
CVS have been the easiest to get silicon
lottery has bend them so they've got a
prices ranging from $180 which is pretty
close to MSRP or available price of also
180 and it ranges up to 310 dollars for
an i3
8350 K so you drop 300 bucks and get
what is competing in price with an r7
1700 and really not too distant from a
7700 K or non cave and but the thing is
the reason they do that is because
they've got a bend so low-end 4.8
gigahertz high and 5 points you
gigahertz so if for some reason you need
a guarantee of a 5.2 gigahertz I three
CPU you can get it for 300 bucks that
probably is not a good buy for a lot of
our audience on the consumer building a
PC side but if for some reason you need
a high-end i3 for benchmarking for
example if you are someone who is not
benchmarking like what we do but like
more competitive fire strike type
benchmarking then I guess it would make
sense that said the CPU is even at the
$180 mark our deal
and I think all of them are deleted
right now so that as we've shown is
helpful to thermals and power as you get
a bit of a power leakage reduction not
necessary on these types of CPUs but it
does help when you start blasting
voltage for overclocks on the case
queues so those are posted and Silicon
lotteries are also listing expected
availability of the 8700 K and 8600 K as
October 27th so there's still a way out
there and when we spoke with retailers
last that's about what we're hearing
we're hearing roughly every other week
inventory is coming in which also
matches for these e 370 board shipments
so it's kind of staggered stepping out
there but it'll get there eventually
yeah either way they've got thighs up
and they're one of the only places that
has some level of inventory so if you
want to deal it and check them out
otherwise NZXT
had a bit of a leak today by accident
this was done by overclockers our code
at UK a retailer and md xt has an h 700
i case that is officially unannounced
and planned for launch at some point but
we don't know when this was picked up by
the overclock net forums and it was
initially posted by OC UK h 700 i case
looks to be a mid tower chassis that
fuses the aged for 40 and s 340 design
elements with a heavy focus on cable
management features rear side cable
routing channels exist along the
backside of the case with the s3 40s
cable management bar making a return in
a more stylistic fashion here the main
compartment includes a fan hub and the
case supposedly includes a quote unique
camp our smart device that digitally
drives RGB lighting and fan performance
interestingly the listing highlights
adaptive noise reduction and quote
machine learning for ideal fan settings
that we presently have no idea what that
means
it looks like the case might include for
air F 120 millimeter fans with pricing
not fully known the OSI UK listing has
the case
200 GBP but US prices as always could be
different considering VAT and things
like that knock to his new chrome axe
line offers color DLC packs for existing
products I think this is where internet
comments start to get to a company Knox
what makes these and products but part
of naktu as Thane is the cup I mean I
have them right here just from another
video we did the color everyone pretty
went to know is where that color comes
from and I I don't I don't mean in a
biological getting rid of waste sense I
mean not to us factories so apparently
that that kind of comments getting to
them because they're pushing out
different color products now they've got
black fans coming out they do already
technically have some black fans but
they're doing more of them in the
existing NF a 14 a 15 and F 12 lines and
then they've also got an NFS 12 a PWM
fan coming out and those have the chrome
axe corners which are basically just
these brown corners except instead of
brown I think they have red green yellow
white black and blue maybe one other one
and those I don't know the price on
right now but I do know that the price
on the four point five inch cable
extensions that are also colored in
those same colors are $10 each giving
knocked with some killer margins the
heatsink shrouds are $30 each and those
go on top of the smaller heat sinks like
this one I think they have something for
the larger ones it covers the entire
like side and top with a chrome axe
branding by Noctua and then the fans are
shipping fan plus color kit for twenty
three to twenty seven dollars so pricing
kind of like always with knock so it's a
bit on the higher side especially with
the color changes but you know it's it's
hard to knock them for it because this
is essentially the only thing people
have routinely hounded knocked over is
the color of their fans so for them to
come out and say you know what fine we
can make a black product like everyone
else
here's even some extra rainbow colors
that you can buy as DLC add-ons so to
complain about that seems a little
unfair but they're trying to try and do
something different so well give them
credit for that
oculus news speaking of doing something
different
oculus is trying to do something
different because VR hasn't really
picked up at all it seems like the
headset the main one the real one has
been cut to four hundred dollars now
following HTC vive cuts earlier this
year and they also have an oculus go for
two hundred dollars not yet out that's
basically going to be an untethered
actually higher resolution product so in
some ways it's technically a bit better
but remains to be seen
a couple things one of which is what's
in the headset so we don't know what
kind of hardware is driving it other
than the screens are a bit higher
resolution and it's untethered and it
doesn't connect to a PC so you're
obviously gonna have less in terms of
graphics and computational capabilities
than a computer would give you but it's
supposed to be mobile so that's what
they've got coming out and that's really
hip out other than this PI Mac stuff
it's it's about all we've seen from VR
for the last couple months so we've done
some VR benchmarks and in terms of
interest it was great the first run but
that kind of thing just dies instantly
because the market isn't really that
huge yet and doesn't seem like it's
going to be this year so there's still
hope for VR to do stop it's just it's
gonna take killer games that are really
desirable and some companies like
Bethesda are working on those so we'll
see maybe when these juggernauts get
into the space they might be able to
pull some gamers and with them that
would really be when I would expect to
see the the make or break of VR when
people like Beth has to start pushing
their product as for that pi max
mentioned this was spotted by Engadget
at a I believe a China based trade show
and they've basically got a weird 8k
sort of VR headset so on a very
technical sense it's a higher resolution
than what
there now and that's good that means you
get rid of some of the screen door
effect it's got a wider fov I think more
than 200 it's 200 210 degrees so
typically with VR you can kind of see
the black bar just like right here on
the edge of your peripheral vision but
the reporter said that they did not
notice that with this one however with
the 8k it's two 4k screens side-by-side
and it's also up scaled so the rendered
output from your machine or at least in
the case of this trade show is lower and
an upscaled the reporter claims that it
was still a much better experience in
terms of pixel density but it is not
really 8k it's just kind of getting that
direction so something to keep an eye on
that's all for this one though you can
