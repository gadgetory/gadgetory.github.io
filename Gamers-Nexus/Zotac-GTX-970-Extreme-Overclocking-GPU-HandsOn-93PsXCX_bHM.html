Nexus tonight and we are here in my
luxurious hotel suite that is not quite
so luxurious it is in Santa Monica we
were at the game 24mm posted by Nvidia
for the GTX 980 unveil I have already
reviewed this card at the time of this
video going lives to check links in the
description below for all that we're
currently looking at so Tech's lineup
but new cards the 980 and the 970
included they have the reference 980
here it is already available for sale
where we'll be tonight after after
midnight there is a base 970 with some
modification to the cooler then we have
the Omega 970 that will be available
soon and this is one we're gonna unbox
today it has the most features in terms
of coolness factor and overclocking an
enthusiast factor so the 970 running
through the most important specs here
has got a slightly overclocked bass and
boost clock and it's also got what ZOTAC
calls power + get that box out of here
power + and there's an OC + option as
well and what both of those do is health
and power regulation and and
overclocking the card so here's the
Omega here's the Omega fresh in the
Faraday cage and what we have here is a
full steel cooler so the shell is all
steel of course you've got an aluminum
sink underneath there are six heat pipes
and all of those are nickel-plated so
just kind of AIDS in the coolness factor
when you're looking at the card the vrm
is hosted on the right side underneath
the sink and then we've got a back plate
on the 970 which Nvidia just started
doing back plates and ZOTAC is
continuing that but then you have a
custom back plate here that is different
from the reference design and that is
called exo-armor so the aircon is
exo-armor as part of their ice storm
cooling solution which can be thought of
as a competitor to MSI's twin frozer
or EVGA is whatever ACX whatever they
call these days so this is ice storm
this one is a two fan unit they're
triple fan units coming out shortly we
don't have a date on that yet there will
be an extreme series that is equipped
with the triple fan cooler and I'll
throw a throw an image up of that so you
can see that the power boost is on the
back so the the power boost is all solid
caps on the back these covers the
capacitors and then you've got the OC
plus option over here which is enabled
with micro USB you plug that straight
into your board and use the firestorm
software and then you can get direct
feed from your video card while
overclocking to see how the performance
of the thermals and all that stuff goes
so this one is priced at $380 there is
the the standard 970 over here which is
priced at Nvidia's MSRP of $330 and that
one doesn't have any changes to the
clocks but it's got a different cooler
and more manufacturers always means
lower prices in the longer run so that's
sort of the run-through of these cards
the 980 by ZOTAC is already available or
will be tonight and then there are more
versions of that coming so that's that's
the zotac lineup of carbs for the 980
and 974 max well again links in the
description below if you need more
information and we will see you all next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
