hardcore overclocking and today we're
gonna be taking a look at the crosshair
seven hero now before we get into all
the power delivery details I'm just
gonna highlight some of the overclocking
features that this board has before that
this is brought to you by the msi gtx
1080 gaming X and Nvidia's GeForce
experience which allows you to retro
actively capture key gameplay moments
with shadowplay convert captures into
gifs with new tools and apply filters to
games hashtag no filter Emma sighs
gaming axe PCBs are high quality with
well-built power management and coolers
that we've previously recommended learn
more at the links in the description
below on the integrated rear i/o you can
find the clear CMOS as well as bios a
flash back button it's in this area so
you can actually flash your motherboard
with no cpu just a just a 24 pin plugged
in and it'll flash off of the 5 volts
done a standby power of your of your
power supply so that's a pretty cool
feature especially handy if you like it
can recover from like corrupted bios
flashes and so that's that the
motherboard does have an 8 pin and a 4
pin for CPU power for those of you
unaware the 4 pin is completely optional
in fact the way these work you could
probably just plug in the 4 pin and not
the 8 pin it would be a terrible idea to
do that but it would probably turn on
but you really do just for daily use as
you really do just need the a pin and
even only quit nitrogen I wouldn't be
surprised if you were fine with just the
8 pin the the 4 pin really shouldn't
make much of a difference under any
conditions
now then moving along the top edge up in
the corner here we find the post code as
well as some troubleshooting LEDs under
that the post code is of course
extremely handy if you're trying to
troubleshoot any kind of boot issues
because it tells you with pretty good
with a pretty good amount of detail what
exactly went wrong
the LEDs below that are they're color
coded and they're much like they're not
as helpful in my opinion but they are a
good quick indicator of what is
malfunctioning even though the post code
will give I'll always give you a you
know better amount of detail so you
basically just check the
goto then check the motherboard manual
for what that code means so yeah that
that's a postcodes much better than the
LEDs but you know it doesn't have hurt
to have both and if you're just trying
to quickly figure out what might be
wrong than the LEDs are a good first
indicator now then under that you find
the power button and the reset button so
you know one turns your computer on and
the other one just resets it so no
rocket signs right there you can't see
it in this picture but there's a voltage
read points right along here they are
well here you can see them better so
that's the actual voltage read points
they are next to the 24 pin which i
think is probably the worst place to put
them in terms of accessibility because
well it's just kind of hard to get
probes from a multimeter under the 24
pin cable that'll be you know plugged
into this area the vcore DRAM and SOC
voltage read points have an upgrade to
them in terms of signal integrity
so they're actually differentially
routed this time around and that
basically means that they'll pick up
less noise and they'll be more accurate
when you when you try to probe them and
also while we're on the back of the
board you can see right here there is a
hole in the socket and this is for
putting a temperature for putting a
thermocouple through four extreme
overclockers to basically monitor the
temperature of their CPU because CPU the
built-in CPU temperature diode it does
not work at well basically below minus
20 degrees it is completely useless even
below minus five degrees the diodes
often just stop working so I'm very very
you know that this is a handy feature
though I I as a you know extreme
overclock it I can see the point of it
I and I can imagine there might be some
scenarios in which it could be helpful
but generally speaking I've never used
it most other people I know of never
never ever used it but for those you
know for those who want to use it it's
there and that definitely doesn't hurt
to have it so that
another one of these features that the
board has now then going down along the
edge you don't really find anything for
a while until you get down here and this
is my first major complaint for the
motherboard don't do this
just like that don't don't do this don't
put you know two control buttons up here
two controls buttons over there and two
more and like another bunch of controls
down here like that's just it makes it
really really hard to sort of have an
optimum orientation for the board
because like if you're comfortable if
you have easy access to this then you
won't have particularly easy access to
that or this if you're on a test bench
so I well I completely understand why
they've done this because this board
isn't an ATX so it does actually like
Asus for their other for a lot of the
other top and ROG boards they're like a
bit wider and that's mostly to well that
allows you to accommodate holding extra
buttons up in the corner here but yeah
that this is like this is just not this
ruins quality of life when overclocking
and so basically your safe boot button
and your retry button are down here the
safe boot you press that and if you have
bad BOTS like if you're having trouble
posting because you've screwed up some
settings you hit safe boot you get into
the BIOS and all of your settings are
still there you've just booted on stock
settings that's a really really handy
feature for those of us who don't keep
good track of saving profiles if you're
good at saving profiles the clear CMOS
is all you really need but this is way
more convenient because you don't need
to save profiles and yeah so that that's
a really nice button tap next to that
there's the retry button the retry
button is for if you have very difficult
memory settings you can press the retry
button a few times to basically force
the motherboard to try retrain the
memory settings and well it's a good way
to try get hard memory overclocks
working
it's not exactly like that this isn't
something you would use for daily
overclocks because restarting your
computer like several times to get your
memory to post properly it probably
means that your memory isn't stable even
once it does post so this is very much
for benchmarking purposes and not for
daily usage next to that you find the
ln2 mode jumper this it kind of varies
how much this does depending on the
motherboard but under without ln2 mode
dips enabled the slow mode switch under
that doesn't work but also your BIOS
voltage limits aren't aren't as
ridiculous as they could be because
normally an ROG motherboard has volt
bios limit BIOS voltage limits that are
completely unsafe for you know long term
usage like you can set like one point
six volts to the CPU two volts into your
memory one point 4 volts into your SOC
like completely ridiculous amounts of
voltage are already accessible without
the ln2 mode if you go into ln2 mode
everything gets bumped up by a couple
hundred more milli volts so you go from
no particularly safe for use as is -
definitely not safe for daily usage at
all and arguably not even safe on
liquid-nitrogen it like basically
unlimited voltage mode more voltage
where then you could ever possibly want
below that you do find the slow mode
switch which does require the ln2 mode
to be enabled to work and what the slow
mode switch does is it forces the like
if you turn it on it forces the CPU
ratio to the lowest possible setting if
you turn it off it puts the CPU back up
to its current speed so very very handy
for extreme overclockers because if
you're just sitting in the bowels you
don't need to say if you running at 5
gigahertz or 5.5 gigahertz or whatever
whatever you've gotten it to similarly
if you're in Windows and just you know
setting the things up or making a screen
shot or doing any or like you know
preparing things there is again no
reason to have the CPU running at 5
gigahertz and you can force the CPU to a
much lower frequency using the slow mode
which a ensures better stability and be
it
he saves you liquid nitrogen because not
running at full speed all the time does
mean the CPU doesn't like you're still
going to be a high voltage but the
massive drop in frequency does actually
significantly lower your power
consumption so it also lowers your
liquid nitrogen usage so that that's a
very very handy feature to have on all
extremo like I think this is a must-have
for most extreme overclocking
motherboards that have a you know high
power consumption architecture available
to it so you know X 99 X 299 X 399 X 4
70 X 370 all of these should have the
slow mode because these CPUs can idle on
a lot of power if you let them and
idling on a lot of power is not good for
for your temper basically or ln2 usage
so that's definitely a nice feature to
have and that pretty much covers it in
terms of the really obvious stuff that
this motherboard has in terms of extreme
overclocking features it does also
support vclt overclocking though will
not cover the details of that here and
yeah it does not have a it doesn't have
a dual BIOS it is a single BIOS
motherboard as was the previous
crosshair Aero board so yeah which
personally I prefer having motherboards
with dual BIOS but well no I just strain
it like it's just better to have a
backup bios built into the board that
don't have one at all and the other
thing is the BIOS chip on this
motherboard isn't even socketed so if
you have one BIOS chip and if that one
BIOS chip fails for whatever reason it
pretty much needs to get like removed
and replaced by soldiering not great so
yeah that is like the the BIOS flashback
function should be able to recover you
from like 99 percent of you know various
BIOS failures and corruptions but if
there's something actually straight up
wrong with the chip then the lack of
there
being a second chip or just the ability
to remove it it is is kind of a problem
so yeah I I do prefer or like I think
for a board in this price category it
really should have a second vial so it
doesn't really make sense to just have
one especially because BIOS chips aren't
exactly expensive and historian and in
the past a lot of our og boards had dual
BIOS so I don't know why they stopped
doing that so much these days anyway
let's get into the power delivery system
now aces have done some interesting
things with the vrm this time well one
interesting thing with the VR I'm other
than making it just more massive like
other than making it massive overkill
there's one interesting thing they've
done so this right here is your V core
and SOC vrm because the way it's
actually laid out is kind of funky so
that right there is your SOC v RM this
is V core right v core and this down
here is also V core and the reason why
this is done is because this motherboard
does not have any display outputs so
there's no good reason to put an APU in
it and even if you did put an APU in it
you can't actually use the APU GPU to do
anything so the SOC vrm on this
motherboard will basically not have to
do any work because it's never going to
be running a you know a apu so asus
decided to put the SOC vrm between the V
Corps and the other V core for basically
thermal purposes because it means that
instead of having one big you know halt
blob like this you get one halt blob
down here and one halt blob down there
and overall your temperature is actually
like your your overall thermal density
is a bit lower because you have this
cold spot in between the two rather than
just having one big halt stripe like
that so that helps improve vrm
temperatures the the actual V RMS
themselves for V core you're looking at
a one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten phase
the SOC is a two-phase like that the
voltage controller is on the back of the
board which is kind of an interesting
place to put it
most boards have it on the front but I
guess since they already had SMDs going
on the back of the board anyway they
decided that well just doing more work
on the back doesn't doesn't really raise
the cost because obviously if you just
do one side of the board it's cheaper
than doing both
so the voltage controller that Asus uses
for the V Corps and SOC BRM is this chip
right here and it is the ASP 1405 so
that is an asus rebranded part from
international rectifier it's probably an
IR probably an ir35 ir35 2:01 so the
same thing you would find on all the
other high-end motherboards it might
have some special features specifically
for Asus but with all probability it's
just probably just like it's almost
certainly just a straight rebrand here
it is running in a 5 + 2 phase
configuration the 2 is for the SOC the 5
runs into a bunch of doublers in this
case IR $35.99 s so the dumbest doubler
that ir makes because this thing
literally just so those are IR $35.99 s
and that gives you a 10 phase by the
definitely liked by the bare minimum
definition of what a 10 phase would be
and the reason some somebody pointed out
last video that I'm less harsh on these
doubling schemes and it's basically
because doubled up a doubled up five
phase has more in common with a 10 phase
than it has with a 4 phase or a five
phase like it is a lot lot better than
just a straight 5 phase it but of course
having like a 10 phase or even a real 8
phase those might have an advantage over
it but it's not comparable to a 5 if
it's doubled up into a 10 so the $35.99
literally just takes two the PWM signal
from the asp 1405 and cuts the switching
frequency in half and puts it into two
phases so this thing does have 10 phase
interleaving so
one phase out of the ten is only ever
turned on at the same time which means
you do get all the benefits like you
have lower Ripple
and you have better thermals on the vrm
and better efficiency but the vrm does
lack things like current balancing
because the IR 3599 is incredibly dumb
it doesn't even do the most basic
current balancing of like turning off
like skipping a phase and it can't do
duty cycle extensions which some of the
really expensive doublers can do but it
does do the bare minimum of that you
know you only do have one time one out
of the ten phases running at any given
time so and your your transient response
is also better than like a comparable
five phase so it is as close enough to
being a ten phase that I'll go and say
it's a ten phase because it doesn't
really deserve to be lumped in with the
other five like with five phase designs
there so that's the control scheme here
the SOC is just a straight you know two
phase running off of the SP 1405 now if
we go back to the front of the board the
actual chips making up each phase well
the chip making up each phase because it
is one chip these are international
rectifier power stages these are ir35
55s the Asus favorite 60 amp power stage
these are actually surprisingly cheap
apparently like you can get these on
digi-key in a reel of three thousand for
two point one seven dollars apiece so
I'm not sure what's up with that I think
they're on like a massive sale because
I'd expect these to cost a lot more
under normal circumstances but yeah
they're currently going for two dollars
apiece so they're cheaper than they
normal then then what I'm like I I
expected to see them around three to
four dollars so yeah but right now these
are cheap which kind of explains why
Isis decides has been using them so much
because this isn't like they've been
throwing these on so many boards
recently and graphics cards and well
it's a 60 amp power stage though the end
result
is that this is massive overkill for a
risin eight core like it's ridiculous
how overkill this vrm is so if you're
looking at running
so with this VR I'm running at 500
kilohertz switching frequency all in the
actual phases so that would be 1
megahertz coming from the controller and
5 volt gate drive for a 8 core like I'm
just gonna go with the 1000 series 8
core and the 8000 and the 2000 series 8
core CPUs because well they're the
highest current draws that you're gonna
see on a am4 motherboard so for the 1000
series at one point for 2 volts you'll
be looking at around a hundred amps and
for the 2000 series you're gonna be
looking at one point for 2 volts and
about 125 amps and with these with this
operating configuration for the vrm
you're at a hundred amps you're looking
at about 12 watts of heat which is very
similar to what we saw in the the
gigabyte gaming 7 and at one point for
you know at 125 amps output you're gonna
be looking at 13 watts of heat because
it's just completely massive overkill
this vrm doesn't need a heatsink
at all like the gigabyte one didn't this
is even more efficient these components
are physically larger this thing will
run ice-cold under basically any
operating conditions it's massive
massive massive overkill and if you
write you know if you crank it up to
liquid nitrogen which I don't have
accurate power figures for liquid
nitrogen yet about 1.8 5 volts and I
think the CPU might hit 200 amps I'm not
100% certain about that because very low
temperatures massively change how much
power as CPU pulls and it by massively
change I mean massively reduce the
amount of power our CPU poles so I'm not
sure if it'll even hit that much current
draw it might go even it might go above
that it might go below that I'm thinking
probably below that but for 1.8 5 volts
200 amps this vrm will only produce
about 22 watts of heat which is just
like it's it's ice
hold like that is still you know spread
across this many phases 22 watts of heat
is really not much so yeah that is that
this thing is massive overkill
it's just absolutely massive overkill
then then again that's like with the
price tag that this board comes with it
makes sense that it would be so yeah
very very impressive erm from Asus also
for temperature monitoring since people
are wondering about that the
temperatures in on this vrm are read
directly from the IR 3555 is they have a
temperature monitoring function built
into them so that's how that's taken
care of and yeah it that that's like
probably that that's one of the most
accurate ways to get vrm temperatures
possible directly from the power stages
because that temperature sensor is
actually built into the silicon that's
doing your switching of the that's
actually in the same silicon as the
MOSFET so it has the least amount of
thermal resistance towards the things
that are actually getting hot now the
SOC vrm is made up of the same 35 55 s
so it's it 2 is ridiculous overkill and
for a so for about 4 well 1.2 volts 20
amps output which is probably around the
max you will see for a CPU risin you're
gonna be looking at about 2.2 watts of
heat and for 30 amps at 1.2 volts you're
gonna be looking at about 2.4 watts of
heat
there's no point rating this for like
SOC current associate current draws of
an APU because there's no display output
so no good reason to put an APU in this
board the SOC VR compass again massive
overkill it's just this is kind of the
kind of everything like everything about
this board really well about this vrm
right here is a best described as
massive over hill so I yeah I can't come
plain here in fact what's kind of
interesting about this vrm right here is
it's it's technically bigger than what
you would get on some other top-end ROG
motherboards on let's say power hungrier
platforms
so yeah this I'm pretty sure is
currently the strongest vrm from ROG
that you can get on a motherboard like I
don't think they have a board with a
stronger vrm than this they do have GPUs
that have had stronger VRMs than this
but not motherboards so this is actually
really close to their top-of-the-line
GPUs in terms of in terms of like the
vrm design which is uh which just like
the the reason why GPU like GPUs get
such some so much stronger vrm designs
is because GPUs are like have a stock
power consumption of like 250 watts
right whereas a CPU at stock is like a
hundred and if you overclock a GPU you
can easily do as much as double the
stock power consumption and on CPUs you
can do roughly the same but a CPU going
from a hundred to 200 watts is nothing
compared to a GPU going from 200 to 400
watts so yeah this really wouldn't look
out of place on a 1080 Ti in fact if my
memory serves me correctly this is very
very very similar to what the Asus 1080
TI Strix has for its of ecore VRA so
yeah this is ridiculous overkill for for
horizon 8 core but hey for a price for a
motherboard at this price point I mean
it'd better be ridiculous overkill so
yeah nothing to complain about the
actual vrm itself the capacitors around
the motherboard so these guys and these
are niche econ FP series and you can
actually tell that these are FP 10ks
so these are rated for oops wrong button
these are FP 10 kHz columns and that 10
K stands for 10,000 hours at 105 degrees
centigrade
I mean Celsius so and I keep doing that
wrong so there so yeah these are
basically the only higher rating I've
ever seen on a motherboard is 12,000 and
honestly if you're not hitting that
hundred and five degree figure the time
that these capacitors last is like
orders of magnitude larger than that
that rating at 105 degrees like if
you're at 80 they last for ages and ages
and ages and ages
so yeah this like you should not be the
CPU will probably be obsolete before
these kappa capacitors and this vrm hit
they're like mean time to failure so
yeah nothing nothing nothing in the
power sit like in the cpu power section
to complain about for the memory power
asus has gone with the Asus usual of
two-phase memory of erm it's this thing
right here and the these MOSFETs so
these are discrete fats and these are
Nyko semiconductor and yeah this is a
really cheap MOSFET manufacturer but the
thing about Ram is that it doesn't
really pull about power well pull all
that much power so these Nyko PE a 16 VA
MOSFETs
even if you have four memory sticks pull
at one point three five volts pulling
two watts each which is actually a bit
high for that voltage you know you're
gonna be looking at six amps output on
this VR I'm max and that'll produce
about one watt of heat so that this
isn't overheating and asus has been
using this for memory vrm design on tons
and tons of boards because it works so
yeah that covers the memory of your room
right there and that covers the actually
the entire board I mean you do get some
minor voltage regulators down here but
none of those is you know you're not
gonna be changing the voltage outputs of
any of those so there's really no need
to worry about there about about them
and yeah that covers the board like my
only complaint is that they put the the
like they put some of the controls down
here and then some of the controls up
here I find that absolutely infuriating
when a motherboard does that because I
use these buttons a lot and when they're
this far apart it really gets you know
it starts getting on your nerves after
the 50th time you need to go press the
safe boot button and it's on the other
end of the motherboard which you can't
reach but other than that like this
board is extremely solid massive amounts
of overkill on the vrm it's just yeah
it's well it's uh it's it's a pretty
heavy upgrade compared to the old
crosshair 6 here Oh actually like you
get not only do you get two phases more
than before all of the MOSFETs were
actually like just upgraded it went from
the Texas Instruments power duel and
that's to these International rectifier
3555 s and that's just another massive
upgrade so yeah it really like this this
is the strongest vrm that I'm aware of
that asus has on on motherboards right
now so yeah that should pretty much tell
you everything you need to know this
thing is massive overkill and they're
like there's like as long as the BIOS is
good there's not really any way that
this mother I could see this motherboard
letting you down physically there's
nothing wrong with it so yeah that's it
for the video

that I have my own channel called
actually hard for overclocking it would
be awesome if you would check that out
