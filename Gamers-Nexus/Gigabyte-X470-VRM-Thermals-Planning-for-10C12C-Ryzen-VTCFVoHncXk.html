you've probably never seen one before
and this one has aluminum fins so
they're breaking the trend of
motherboard manufacturers we're very
happy that gigabyte has decided to do
that on the board it's on currently the
gigabyte gaming 7x 470 board it's not
actually necessary which will show you
through thermal testing today we're
gonna put in some probes on a couple of
MOSFETs running it through various tests
of the 2700 X and looking at the thermal
results and then talking about why they
are the way they are before that this
video is brought to you by thermal takes
view 37 case the vo 37 focuses on
highlighting custom PC builds with its
full panoramic window and tinted front
acrylic and our thermal testing the view
37 performed reasonably well when
considering its looks focused build
which is partly thanks to the airflow
design and the removal of a bottom power
supply shroud for a balance of looks and
performance check the link in the
description below for the view 37 so as
noted you'll see in a moment that this
isn't entirely necessary on this
motherboard but it's a good move in the
right direction
and if we can get manufacturers into the
habit of making heat sinks with actual
fins instead of just a giant block of
aluminum with no surface area that would
be a good thing overall because
eventually these types of designs as
simple as it seems do carry over to
boards like the Intel boards for example
where you're probably dealing with
higher power consumption power
throughput with a heavy overclock or two
might carry over to boards even an
export 70 line that just use weaker
power stages and fewer of them for this
board the gaming 7 we have a build Zoid
analysis of it already which you should
check out on the channel if you haven't
but the short of the important features
here is that gigabyte using a 10 plus 2
phase setup and they are using IR 3553
MOSFETs which are 40 amp power stages so
not really that in need of cooling in
the form of a heatsink with fins but it
doesn't hurt the asus motherboard we
have the crosshair 7 Hiro is kind of
like the gigabyte vrm except even more
extreme it uses 60 amp power stages on
also a 10+2 design so it's even less in
need of heat sinking but let's go over
the numbers for what our K types said
when we put them
the the MOSFETs we had to on here
primarily so we had one on the what
would be the top side of the vrm and it
was on the inner MOSFET so it's gonna be
the warmer one which is adjacent to the
SOC vrm and we had the SOC beer I'm
running at 1.2 volts for the overclocked
tests which would generate some
neighboring heat and kind of warm that
up we also had a probe on one of the
central MOSFETs over here on the
vertical part of the vrm the core vrm
and it was in the center because that's
where it'll get the hottest so we wanted
to see what the hot spots looked like
let's get the chart on the screen with
the 2700 exit left to stock and XF are
two configured to stock settings we
measured a maximum v core vrm mosfet
temperature of fifty two point four
degrees celsius with a forty one degree
measurement for the top mosfet measured
TDI was fifty nine point five note that
these are not deltas over ambient
they're just straight temperatures
ambient was twenty-eight degrees for
every test and we did actively log it
anyway just in case overclock into four
point two gigahertz and one point 4
volts 1.41 pushed our MOSFET
temperatures to sixty five degrees for
the last V core MOSFET or 51 for the top
MOSFET this is with extreme LLC four V
core and high LLC for SOC voltage note
that this is also with an SOC voltage at
one point two so our neighboring SOC is
providing some heat SOC vrm at these
settings from pushing 139 Watson to the
motherboard for blender at the EPS 12
volt rail in stock or about 186 watts
when overclocked this is about a 30
minute test and we're measuring the
average high temperatures after that
steady state is reached
removing the heatsink entirely the Left
MOSFET operated at 56 degrees Celsius so
about four degrees warmer than the
complete stock configuration with the
heatsink which was 52 degrees the top
MOSFET operated at 56 degrees Celsius
for a 15 degree increase over the 41
degree results with the heatsink there's
clearly an actual advantage to having a
heatsink and that's primarily realized
at the top part of the vrm but it's
ultimately not a make-or-break situation
removing the heat sink and overclocking
still keeps us within reason there is no
real change for the left side and we're
in variants of the original overclocked
with heatsink results there's however a
16 degree increase for the top MOSFET
even still that FET is still only
hitting 65 point five degrees which is
completely reasonable as we said in
builds wideo part of the reason you're
seeing the performance you are is
because we think these vendors might be
planning for a future higher core count
CPU amphoras gonna be around for a while
the board vendors might be trying to
plan ahead so that their motherboards
remain relevant and they don't have to
keep refreshing them every time a CPU
launches so that's probably part of why
the VRMs are overkill on most of the x4
70 boards right now that we've looked at
and also would explain of course
why you have potentially more powerful
heat sinks that are needed of course
that's a good thing to do in general in
terms of the temperatures you want these
things to run at 4 capacitors you
probably targeting under 105 degrees
Celsius at 105 see a lot of caps on the
market will last either 5 or 10,000
hours some bad ones are 2.5 thousand
hours that's at 105 C and you start
losing large portions of life for every
10 degrees Celsius you go up in
capacitor temperature for the MOSFETs
which are the parts that are actually
getting warm that we're measuring you
really don't want to go over 125 150 C
depending on if you're talking about t
KS or whatever its internal over
temperature protection is if it has one
that tends to be 150 degrees Celsius and
at that point you might get some D
rating you'll definitely get some
inefficiency and if you really push it
too hard it could pop but most of the
MOSFETs on boards like this have over
temperature protection that should
prevent that scenario from happening
clearly we're very far away from 150
degrees we're still far away from a
hundred 25 degrees so either way they're
number you pick you're well within
safety margins even without a heatsink
of course we'd recommend leaving it on
because doesn't hurt it helps
performance clearly if you put a Fender
ectly over it it'll help even more we
had no airflow for this test by design
because we wanted to just do it without
air flow and see how much difference we
saw and I mean it's it's fine it helps
to have it we're very happy to see
gigabyte adding this but it's also not
necessarily on this board and it's not
gonna be necessary on
the other board of this type with an
actually really good vrm for rising to
overclocking just because you're not
gonna be pushing that much power in
general unless you start doing things
with L on to in which case you have
different things to consider anyway as
for the power going through these builds
I'd has a video on our channel already
talking about that he gives all the
current ratings theoretical voltages
watt draw stuff like that
check the video for more information on
that there is a bit of an exponential
voltage curve as frequency increases so
once you start hitting 4.2 gigahertz to
get beyond that or even to four point
two requires we've actually plotted it
out for a future video but the curve
basically goes like that
so it's more of a straight line at some
point so you do kind of run into voltage
law walls before you run into cooling
walls with a VR mm anyway and rise into
is certainly power-hungry but it's got
limits still so yeah well done on the
vrm cooling and the vrm in general
gigabyte the whole thing is good in our
books the heatsink is completely
unnecessary but we're not gonna be mad
about it because this is what I've been
asking for for a year now I'm happy to
see it and I'm excited to see it for
boards that actually do need it which
will be coming out at some point this
year as for the rest BIOS is somewhat
barren on the gigabyte gaming 7 we would
like to see more memory some timing
options we'd like to see better tuning
for memory sub timings with various kits
there are some kits that work better
than others in this board the gigabyte
board needs some work in automatic
memory timings in general for anything
below that kind of primary six or so
timings and also more power limit
options would be nice to see so BIOS is
definitely gigabytes weakest aspect of
their motherboards but the vrm is is
doing quite well so overall we could
recommend the board if you needed
something in this price range there's
not a lot to be mad about if you really
need something heavy-duty for
overclocking a su still has the Best Buy
us right now for Rison mm just kind of a
question of whether you're really going
to need all of those options and a lot
of people don't and you do pay for those
options so if it's not something that
you know you're going to use then you
could save some money so then the next
board that we'll be looking at is the
crosshair 7 hero we use this for some of
our review as well we're using it and
a lot of other testing for feature tests
with Verizon to check back for that
subscribe for more always there's a lot
more coming out soon go to patreon.com
slash cameras nexus tell us that
directly stored on cameras nexus dotnet
to pick up a mod matte like this one
which is on backorder now we'll have
more in and a couple of probably let's
call it five to six weeks to be safe
they'll be shipping out and i'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
