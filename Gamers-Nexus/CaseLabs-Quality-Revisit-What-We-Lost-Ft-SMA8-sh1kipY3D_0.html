case labs was a small manufacturer of
high end PC cases that went out of
business in August of 2018 bankrupted by
acclaimed combination of new 10%
American terrifying and the loss of a
major account the latter of which was
likely more responsible we'd been in
contact with case labs in the months
prior and about a month before its own
doom we even received at one of the SMA
eight - a magnum enclosures for review
unfortunately we had just started moving
into the new office and by the time the
dust had settled they were done for case
labs almost certainly knew that the end
was coming when they shipped our case
and probably knew that the review would
never release while the company was
still around it stopped being a priority
for us after that reviews of products
that nobody can buy aren't especially
helpful but it's been sitting in storage
ever since unopened and now that even
more time has passed
it's worth a revisit to see what
everyone is missing out on with case
labs gone before that this video is
brought to you by thermal grizzly and
their high-end thermal compounds thermal
grizzly makes cryo not paste for high
thermal performance and conductivity
without being electrically conductive so
you don't have to worry about shorting
components cryo knot is particularly
good for replacing stock GPU pastes as
cryo knot is a non curing compound learn
more at the link in the description
below a couple really important things
here for this review one can you see me
out if this thing's pretty big it's
blocking 60% of our light sorry - this
is difficult to review so typically our
case reviews if you're not familiar with
them are really detailed on the thermal
and acoustic testing side of things with
this case this isn't our standard to
ignore this with this case our standard
test bench is aa biz it's just comical
it's clearly not what this case was
meant for and that makes it difficult to
do the thermals and noise and stuff like
that because there's no point so we did
do a few tests anyway just for posterity
sake
but this case is meant for a few things
meant for something like a server build
which is what Patrick is working on I
can see he has a lot of pride in it and
also things
like dual water cooling loops and there
are plenty of those out there for you to
see but we really wanted to work on this
as a server case it's big it should
support dual socket boards ours is sort
of jerry-rigged in there but we'll talk
about that later
so it's a large case and we have some
b-roll shots of this thing that it looks
a bit better than in its current state
but we'll talk about this shortly
because it is important as well so
anyway case labs the company originally
opened with expert machinists so that's
what case Labs was before it became the
company that made these they were
machinists and that gives case labs a
very unique gave case labs a very unique
position in the market and that you're
buying from people who are skilled
experts in making the thing they're
selling as opposed to most companies and
there's nothing wrong with this approach
either where it's experts who are
skilled at designing the thing and then
they send it out to be made elsewhere so
that's where case labs deviates from all
the other case companies unfortunately
it's also why it's it's really difficult
to stay alive with that business model
because you're paying people who are
going to be higher wage workers in the
US especially and who are hands-on
making these things without a massive
automated Factory and a huge supply
chain and all the stuff that the big
companies that pump out cases have the
benefit of so it makes case labs cases
genuinely boutique cases and they're
amazing in a lot of ways we'll talk
about them through Patrick's filled
notes they're also expensive like crazy
expensive this one was we're not even
fully sure cuz the the company I mean
the company is gone we can't check her
order information but when we requested
the sample the case would have been a
retail equivalent equivalent of over
seven hundred dollars easily for the
case that's what a computer costs if you
build it on a budget so it's interesting
anyway they are expensive boutique cases
they're high quality high build quality
high attention to detail there's some
small things that case I was missed in
here we'll talk about those given the
circumstances they might not have
normally missed those things and then
the cases are often focused on things
like dual liquid loops
really unique custom build and server
type builds which is what Patrick's
working on here dual socket build and
things like that so case labs also
became somewhat famous during the
thermaltake scandal where Thermaltake
developed the name quotes thermal fake
because of allegations that thermaltake
had stolen case labs design ideas and we
won't get into the details here on on
how those allegations ended or how that
a legal battle concluded but it doesn't
really matter because what mattered was
that case labs and Thermaltake got into
a big legal fight and thermal takes much
bigger so regardless of who's right and
who's wrong when it's a legal battle
money's at play ultimately and the
Thermaltake might have had more of that
available so these are all things that
led to case labs dying and it's
unfortunate to lose a company that
really focuses on a high quality product
but also at the same time that's what
happens a lot of the time when there's
no volume mover to really hold financial
stability while you're working on
building something like this which took
like months to even get because things
like powder coating that we don't think
it was done in-house because powder
coating for the blue on the inside of
this took something like between I think
they cited between 3 and 12 weeks or 8
and 12 maybe it was a lot so you could
be out of a case for 3 months after you
order one because you're waiting for it
to be how powder-coated you don't have
to get a powder coated but it's just all
these little things that make it
difficult to compete clearly so let's
talk about the case will go through
Patrick's build notes the testing there
will be some discussion on testing there
are technically some thermal numbers
they are not important at all because
normally we're testing a reasonable case
with some fans included and it's tested
in that config for the user who's
building on that budget to use those
fans or maybe do a slight mod to them
this is a it doesn't come with fans it's
meant for like 200 loop liquid or it's
meant for a massive server and so
there's honestly no point
we did a couple tests anyway just
because no no why not we had already
built it so they're just not that
important so keep that in mind let's get
into patch to build notes the packing
job was impressive in itself almost none
of the case sections are thicker than 2
centimeters so they were all stacked
tightly and wrapped with paper so much
paper a lot of paper and then placed in
a box that wasn't much larger than the
finished product unlike mass produced
cases case labs enclosures shipped as a
stack of completely disassembled parts
to be assembled in Ikea like style
complete with an 18-page instruction
booklet our booklet was filled with
pictures of a black case against a white
background printed entirely in color so
maybe toner refills were the secret
third reason for the bankruptcy the
manual is thorough when it comes to
basic assembly but not all of the custom
options we chose were covered and it
took some serious experimentation to
figure out where the fan and LED mounts
went properly the core of the chassis is
built from 2.5 millimeter thick aluminum
panels assembled with dozens of
countersunk screws we're no machining
experts but for a team as small as case
labs 16 employees at the end
drilling threading and countersinking
all those holes must have been a
time-consuming operation all the cable
cutouts are lined with strips of rubber
that have been carefully cut to just the
right size
external panels are made of thinner 1.75
millimetre aluminum and the tempered
glass window is just a flat rectangular
sheet bolted onto one side the whole
package is surprisingly light given the
size we're used to XXL cases being
covered in packing materials packed with
extra material around glass panels and
shipped all as one piece a lot of cases
also used heavier metals for example or
are just less efficient in their packing
the SMA 8 is just a stripped down box
that doesn't even come with fats the all
aluminum construction doesn't hurt
either it is very expensive though and
that thickness of aluminum is
particularly steep for the bill of
materials even though the quantity of
screws is large the variety is
thankfully small a Phillips head driver
and a 5/16
hex socket driver are the only tools
necessary and the ladder is supplied
with the case the front IO includes USB
3.1 and an HDMI pass-through for VR we
chose a kit that includes an optional
reset button which is packed separately
along with an alternate faceplate to
accommodate it
a third faceplate could be ordered that
was entirely blank except for the power
button but we didn't pick it up
all the cables are generously long
except for the ones on the power and the
reset buttons would struggle to reach
their connections on the opposite corner
of the case the motherboard tray and PCI
backplate assemble as one unit and fit
into the rails of the case so the system
can be almost fully assembled outside of
the case and then slid in technically it
also has standoffs if you wanted to use
this as a test bench but realistically
that's probably not too common of a use
case it's a tight fit so there's no
rattling once everything's seated and
those tight tolerance for fitment is
part of what made the case such a
high-quality build may be the most
disappointing aspect of our specific SMA
8a
was that it only supports standard ATX
motherboards and the smaller EI TX
boards despite its massive size case
labs are offered a $10 option for a
longer motherboard tray that would
support dual socket EA TX boards but we
either didn't choose it or didn't get it
so the whole front half of our case is
usable only for reservoirs and nothing
else at least not unless you have an
active imagination and can build
something like our dual socket system by
using a PCIe slot cover radiator screw a
nut and some zip ties our case didn't
even come with front fan mounts which is
potentially a normal thing it just
depends these cases are fully
customizable to order so if we specified
that we wanted them in our order we
would have gotten them but at the same
time the company was shutting down and
we're not really sure what the
specification was anymore because it's
probably one of the last things they
threw together before shipping out it's
impossible to tell at this point
unfortunately specifically what we
ordered either way we jury-rigged our
case to fit longer boards by double
stacking standoffs so that the board
could clear the forward section of the
case it doesn't seem like there was a
good reason to buy the more limited
a TX version of the case leaves more
room for reservoirs in the front but
even the SSI EE B version has plenty of
space cable management is accomplished
with aluminum bars that screw in to the
rear of the motherboard tray these bars
are definately sturdy but clearance is
tight for 24-pin power cables especially
sleeved ones that can't be flattened out
there are barely any cable tie points
and none big enough to fit the velcro
straps that we would like to use none of
this is especially important though
because the sheer amount of space behind
the motherboard tray and in the bottom
chamber of the case I mean that an
entire power supplies worth of cables
could be hidden without any management
at all there were also a few minor
issues lifting either side panel off the
hinges requires moving the top panel
because it's slightly over Hanes them
the screw holes for the rear exhaust fan
were drilled slightly smaller than the
ones on the rest of the case we're not
quite sure why but we did have to use a
different screw most of the fan mounts
are single size designed to fit 120
millimeter fans of nothing else but it's
not like this is hidden from you at
purchase and then there are some
features lacking that are common in the
factory produced cases that we usually
review the things that are mass-produced
and massive factories in Asia the
expansion slot and drive bay screws are
difficult to access because they're
obstructed by other parts of the case
there are no screwdriver cutouts which
makes it sort of annoying sometimes when
working with PCIe expansion slots
filters and fan mounts could be
purchased separately and it seems like
these are one of the few case Labs
products that are still actively being
sold so if you did want those you could
go get them but just not the case using
the Internet Archive to look at the case
labs website reveals quite a few custom
options in order case color.black
default $35 or gunmetal or white
optional two-tone color scheme $25.00
extra form factor ATX or e ATX default
$10 for SSI eep or wider EA TX which we
really wish we had gotten but we might
not have asked for we're not sure
standard or reverse case orientation
case floor with either lighting mounts
which were brand new at the time they
shut down or removable plate motherboard
chamber floors solid default or 15
for the three-time 120-millimeter fan
cutouts and five-and-a-quarter cut out a
side door salad default $30 acrylic $50
glass top cover ventilated solid $20 for
thirty nine millimeter extended height
ventilation and somebody dollars for 120
millimeter extended height also
ventilated more than twenty different
options for various front cover fan
mount combinations all boiling down to
whether they're ventilated solid or
tempered glass motherboard tray styles
can even be changed the case is 100%
customizable what we're getting at you
can have their eight slot default
motherboard trays you can do $34 for 8
slot plus two vertical and a riser cable
your $36 for five vertical and riser
cable fifty six dollars for five
vertical and two riser cables
front i/o is customizable you can do
none you can do USB 3.0 by two and audio
by two being two of them
$35 for additional USB 3.1 type-c and
HDMI $35 for a second side fan mount $25
for an LED strip mounting kit and $29
for the reset switch retrofit kit all
this is on top of a $650 base price it's
absolutely crazy how customizable this
case is cooler master wishes they could
be this customizable with their maker
series cases it's ridiculous and this
isn't really something that you could do
with the normal factory mass production
setup it has to be done at a smaller
scale because there's not feasible
otherwise so case-knives really had
something unique there unfortunately
it's also what makes the case is really
expensive and it makes it hard to run it
and stay in business when you have that
type of model small operation expensive
products and a lot of competition in the
market testing the SMA 8a with our
standard hardware is a bit of a joke
since it's specifically geared toward
overkill liquid cooling loops the case
that is our air cooled bench is as a
full ATX board but it looks like a mini
ITX board huddled down in one corner of
the massive case we chose to add four
1900 rpm Lian Li Bora fans for testing
because this test doesn't particularly
matter too much
and because Lian Li and their Bauer sent
us nine of them and we can't figure out
what else to use them for to were placed
under the top of the power supply shroud
as intake bottom and one was at the CPU
cooler level as top intake
one more fan was in the single rear slot
as rear exhaust and we didn't bother
doing any test beyond this for reasons
already stated so there's no stock
baseline because this doesn't ship with
fans and it's not meant for that use
honestly well let's just let's just get
through them CPU temperature during the
torture test with just one fan pointed
down at the cooler and one pulling
exhaust out was forty six point five
degrees Celsius one of the coolest
results we've gotten and close to the
age 500m mesh the massive size of the
case means that with any airflow at all
it's practically equivalent to an
open-air bench and then you just use the
fans to guide the air we did try torture
testing without any fans at all but even
in a case this big because it's still
not purely open air it caused
overheating problems so we dropped that
test GBO tortured temperature was forty
four point six degrees Celsius over
ambient slower than any of the other
cases on the charge that's because to
ninety hundred rpm fans were directly
blasting the cooler with air pulled in
from the vast empty chamber at the
bottom of the case we could have
populated two slots directly under the
GPU for an even lower temperature but we
put one under the GPU and one farther
towards the front so that the air split
and also benefits the CPU GPU
temperature and fire strike was slightly
higher at forty six point one degrees
but it usually is slightly higher and
again this is the lowest temperature on
the chart approach to only by the SL 600
M that's not particularly fair since we
did put 1900 rpm fans into a $700 case
but you get the idea the right
configuration and enough brute force
makes anything good CPU temperatures
when rendering our blender test file
exclusively on the CPU averaged thirty
six point six degrees Celsius over
ambience that's tied with the half X and
nearly tied with the open air ku or
conquer the fans we installed our higher
quality than most cases ship with but
again it's a $650 case minimum that's
designed for liquid cooling GPU
temperature during the combined GPU and
CPU render averaged twenty one point
seven degrees Celsius over ambience
which is still lower than anything else
on the chart again almost even with the
SL 600 M so conclusion I'm still not
sure if you can even see me
it's very dark this case is gigantic you
can't buy the case as it was intended to
be bought you can't buy the case at all
at this point so you can't buy from case
labs at least not the case
can't buy with all the options and
that's really where the case was
impressive was just how customizable it
was because when he bought from case
labs as you heard when I went through
the all of the different ways you could
customize the case it was your case when
it was done
you basically sent them a spec and paid
them and then they made a case for you
that's pretty cool service it's
expensive service aha and clearly not
something that most people would ever
pay for I mean you know we we probably
wouldn't pay for it because just
financially there are so many not
necessarily better but there are so many
more financially in our position
responsible options or maybe just
cheaper options in general and they're
still suited for the job so that's the
difficulty and yeah that's it's the same
argument for any other boutique brand in
an industry where it's hard to survive
it's expensive because it's low volume
and it's low volume because it's
expensive and it's also low volume
because it's people who are extremely
concerned about quality to a point that
they just don't trust anyone else to
really do it or at least not at the same
level of mass production as these larger
companies where they're okay with pushy
now $50 $100 cases $150 cases that still
have lots of flaws because they know at
the end of the day what matters is that
it's good enough and you have to settle
for good enough when you're dealing with
mass production because you'll never
make anything otherwise so that's case
labs really deviated from that and
that's where it shines because it's so
customizable but there may be some stock
left with case labs that various
distributors of theirs there might be
some used cases on eBay but the usual is
it worth it conclusion to our review is
not possible here so this is not a
proper review you can't buy the product
so it's not is it worth it it's not or
the thermals any good it was it cool and
the answer to was it cool is yes it's
absolutely cool it's really well built
it does have flaws so let's you know no
rose tinted glasses here there are flaws
we listed them
but it's cool and this is a case that
was more or less hand-built and that's
very interesting so you know again it's
16 employees at a small company a lot of
whom are machinists and that's not a
story you get at a lot of places so the
Giants opulently expensive case that
this is is what makes it inherently
interesting especially as a post-mortem
it's sad however that no more will be
made we understand why that's the case
because expensive and losing a massive
client is probably the biggest blow they
took the terabyte does hurt a bit but at
that time there was discussion of the 25
percent tears but they hadn't been
enacted and they still haven't had time
of filming ten percent tariffs we
believe had been enacted at that point
where we're very close to it so
technically there was a tariff hike it
was 10 percent it did affect this
company they use a lot of aluminum it
probably affected the bottom line but
you can raise prices if you have to and
ten percent on $600 is certainly a lot
660 now but when you're at that price
the customers might still pay it so it's
really more likely the default of an
account or the loss of a big account
that killed the company not necessarily
just the tariffs although we certainly
would believe that there was also
impacted them so it's an expensive case
it was made with expertise it was made
with a lot of care and a lot of aluminum
we'll probably be using ours too how is
the dual Xeon system that we're
currently working on we're
troubleshooting it that's why it's a
mess like this and probably for future
content pieces too so keep an eye out
for this thing again it's extremely
likely we use this for a dual Xeon
system it's also likely that we end up
doing an open loop on it because that's
kind of what the case was made for so
check back for that but you've got the
review on build quality you have a
little bit of history on it and then you
have the well a couple thermal numbers
that are totally pointless so anyway
here's what we want to know how did you
feel about case labs whether you knew
about them before or you just learned
about them today yeah how how do you
feel about this type of product even if
you're not ever
to buy on what's your feeling and you
know do you do you miss that the company
is gone or do you just not care because
the market does what the market does
