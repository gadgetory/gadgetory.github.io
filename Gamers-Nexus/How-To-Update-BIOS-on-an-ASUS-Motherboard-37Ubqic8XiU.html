Nexus Donette and today we are flashing
bios using an ACS crosshair V or v
formula board this is similar to the
Maximus series this one's a bit older
it's 2011 but same overall function
we're using what is called easy flash
update bios and updating bios or
flashing firmware as it is also called
is useful if you want to upgrade your
bias to unlock new features so
historically this was used when the X 3
Series CPUs were out ACS and other
companies added core unlocking with a
BIOS update so you can do that can also
up that update for raid fixes and things
along those lines to do this with the
asus easy easy flash utility you just
navigate over to the tool tab and if you
are wondering yes it is in fact calling
you a tool and it even says be used to
update bios so we know exactly what it
is doing in plain english hit enter on
the easy flash utility and that will
open now one thing you need to know is
before entering this you need to
download the BIOS update to a flash
drive some of the modern boards can
update over-the-air or a via wireless or
wired functionality this one only does
it from a flash drive so you download
the update from a Seuss's website to
your flash device plug it in boot to
this and then you can select the device
and the correct dot rom file for your
update one other item to note is that
abrupt power loss can result in in
breaking your board as we call it which
means it is basically turned into a
brick except it's less useful than a
brick and some modern boards will have
dual BIOS meaning that you can fail once
and you normally hit a switch and switch
to your second BIOS chip that way you're
still good to go
so from this menu we will select the
newest update which is 1703 up here you
can see our current version 1605 hit
enter do you want to read this file ok
hit enter and it's going to sit there
and update if I hit enter instead of
shift it will update and you'll get a
progress bar once it starts so now we
can see this processing once this is
done it'll pretty simply just let you
know that you need to reboot and your
BIOS is updated check back to the
YouTube channel for
or a similar video on Emma sighs which
is a bit more interesting because you
can do this from from Wireless
functionality like I mentioned I believe
one of them allows you to do it through
the hard drive we will also be looking
at asrock in the next few days so check
the channel for that and I will see you
all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
