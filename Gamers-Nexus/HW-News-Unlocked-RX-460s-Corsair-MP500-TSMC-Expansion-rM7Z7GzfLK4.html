news week for hardware normally towards
the end of the year generally we expect
it to calm down a little bit especially
that's here since it's been non-stop
since May around Computex time but it's
still going this week for news we've got
some interesting updates on the rx 460
suddenly becoming a bit more relevant
with some unlocking via BIOS
functionality of course unofficial and
there's AM the rise in which we covered
another video some interesting SSDs from
Corsair and more but before we get into
that this coverage is brought to you by
msi and their new core frozer L CPU
cooler which you can see in our new case
testing bench we've been using that
lately for the new case reviews and
you've probably seen it at this point
but let's get straight into it so first
off the most interesting item at least
that I think is the rx 460 unlocking
this was found by der bauer one of the
overclockers he's sort of peers with
build Zoid you're mostly all familiar
with builds lloyd at this point from
actually hardware overclocking there
Bauer is one of his counterparts he's an
overclocker he's found that you can
unlock the rx for 60s from the native
896 cores to a 1024 core count and that
of course includes an increase in TM use
because you're probably unlocking a full
block basically on the GPU so that goes
from 56 TM used to 64 pretty good gain
in terms of both core count and TM use
and that actually will reflect in
performance I'm not going to talk about
how much just yet cuz I actually want to
test it myself but we will be doing a
guide this weekend hopefully on how to
unlock an Rx 460 it currently only works
for as far as we're aware the sapphire
nitro 4 gigabyte card and asus strix 4
gigabyte card may work for other devices
but as far as we know right now the bios
unlocks the mods which you can apply
just through normal flashing tools are
only available for those two devices in
particular but we'll have a guide on how
to do that and then sometimes work
performance with preliminary information
on the gains do note one thing here the
Andy relive drivers do impact some of
the unlocks that have been applied in
custom BIOS instil
elsewhere so might impact these it's
really hard to say now if MD is going to
be validating BIOS going forward with
their drivers that could pose a problem
for things like this but it's too soon
to tell right now very quickly I will
mention that Andy Rison the Zen
architecture update was streamed this
week we have a separate video on it if
you want to learn more about it go there
and that is the eight core sixteen
thread CPU three point four gigahertz
they put it against an i7 sixty nine
hundred K Broadwell II CPU from Intel
and had mostly parity in terms of
performance so that is covered in our
other video including some caching
discussion next topic this one is from a
company that honestly I'd never heard of
until I checked my email just before
this video company called Zadok 511 is
producing a new kit of the just more RGB
stuff so it's ddr4 RGB memory and then
the part that I thought was interesting
enough to at least show was the RGB SSD
and it's basically got sort of one's own
I think with an isolating bar down the
middle it lights up on either side of it
and is controllable via software for
both the DRAM and the SSD so you can
actually control the colors to software
doesn't require extra cables few
interesting things here first of all
Zadok 511 of course instantly I was like
who the heck are they is this some
fly-by-night company when looked it up
using a quick who is their domain was
registered in December of 2015 they're
pretty new about a year old at this
point and it is owned by a pacer which
is actually known company in memory and
is a Taiwanese company based in Taiwan
they're run by a pacer and they're
created about a year ago it's focused on
modding now with that said the new
devices are called the shield I've
reached out and asked for price
availability what controller was used
what NAND was used all these things
because they didn't tell us anything
about it other than the fact that they
have l ET's which i suppose all you need
to know these days so I don't have that
information just yet but worth pointing
them out the memory we know clocks at
twenty four hundred megahertz at the low
end they go up to three thousand
megahertz kits sold in
fasces up to 64 gigabytes ddr4 not too
exciting their SSD I know nothing about
because they didn't tell us anything and
then we know that the well that's not
true there's one interesting thing about
the SSD that's worth noting and that is
it is a dual interface as is d though
that's not you can use them jointly and
get expanded throughput or anything
crazy like that which would be
interesting but it's just that you
basically you get a USB type-c connector
on it so three point one type C and then
there's also the standard SATA 3
connector on theory with USB 3.1 type C
you get a bit more throughput then on
SATA 3 which is kind of a dying slash
needs to die interface for SSDs but it
depends on the controller and then and
how much of that extra bandwidth
actually be utilized so that's from
Zadok I not gonna recommend that's so
they pre-ordering that stuff but we
might look at it and if we do then we
figure out then if it's worth it does
remind me a bit of a vexer though also
an SSD news you may have seen on our
website this week that one of our
writers Eric Hamilton covered the SSD
price increases that are expected so I
very briefly mentioned this in an ask GN
video and a couple folks comments and
things like doesn't affect me because I
just bought this SSD for this great
price and obviously SSD prices are fine
that's not really what's going on here
what's going on is somewhere in the
range of 2017 to 2018 you should expect
an increase in both SSD prices and hard
drive prices at least at the higher end
and that's because of two things decide
the manufacturing is increasing so much
that obviously there's a supply shortage
or can't keep up with demand and most of
that's going to Mobile and then on the
hard drive side there's just a lot of
the factories are spinning down because
the hard drives sort of are spinning
down especially in consumer that's not
the main point of breeding this topic up
though the main point of bringing up the
SSD prices because we already covered
this in the article if you're curious to
learn more about that and why it's going
on main reason is because Corsairs also
got a new SSD so I guess they're gonna
have fierce competition from Zadok 511 I
really need to watch their backs they're
Corsairs SSD is a
Bible of the fourth series you may
remember therefore series from years ago
Corsair sort of abandoned that market
which being a memory manufacturer was an
interesting move to say the least but it
seems like they're trying to come back
so to come back reviving the fourth
series with the MP 500 m2 SSD and that
is an nvme drive that lives on four PCIe
lanes so that would put it theoretically
with its files on controller I don't
know what the NAND is right now but we
know it's a fuzz on e7 controller that
would theoretically put it in
competition about where the samsung 960
Evo is right now and the advertised
specifications is all I can go off of it
we haven't tested it and so I you know
grain of salt and all of that but the
advertised specifications they've given
us are three gigabytes per second
sequential read 2.4 gigabytes per second
sequential right and then the random
transactions are rated for about 250,000
4k read and about 210,000 4k write IOPS
so that's what we have for the Corsair
drive right now the MB 500 and that will
be using the Phi's on PS 5000 East 7
controller and undeclared going to be
reaching out to them about that though a
couple other things that notes the sort
of smart suite of technology so that's
things like smart flush and AEC and
refresh and all these features alongside
the existing files on control of garbage
collection we're leveling and right up
suffocation factors features which of
course are the same on all drives but
with probably some tuning on coarser
side at least something to set them
apart that's how these things work so
that I don't have a have any more
information on it but that's the the
basics right now final news item this
one's kind of on the industry side it's
been interesting though so TSM C Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation
is expanding its operations to include a
new nearly 16 billion-dollar fabrication
facility so it's a fifteen point seven
billion dollar plant they already have
outfits in a couple places in Taiwan in
China and now they're adding this one
and this will expand to support five
nanometer and three nanometer production
a couple things here first item of note
the way that TSMC defines their process
and their nodes doesn't necessary
the same as the way Intel defines theirs
for example so five and three nanometer
may mean different things depending on
which manufacturer you talk to with this
one I don't know if they're going to be
you v-- lithography or not it might not
be but we'll we'll really have to wait
and find out more technical information
on that because there's not been a lot
revealed just yet but five nanometer
three nanometer production support for
the new 16 billion dollar facility they
are currently researching at least
lightly two nanometer process and then
there's a seven nanometer chip as I
understand it now that actually exists
and is being experimented on at TSMC so
that's kind of news on the production
front if you're not familiar with tsmc
they're probably most known by our
viewers for their Pascal 16 nanometer
FinFET process and they also worked on
the Snapdragon ten nanometer CPUs and
the iPhone seven whatever they use a ten
I think processor is with iPhone 7 uses
so TSMC targeting production by 2020 to
include five nanometer and three
nanometer in their fabrication
manufacturing seven nanometer under
experimentation and ten nanometer
process should be profitable by end of
year 2017 so that's all we have for you
