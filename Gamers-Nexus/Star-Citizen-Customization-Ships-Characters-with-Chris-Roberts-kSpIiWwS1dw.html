Nexus Donette and we are back with part
two of our interview with chris roberts
working on star citizen hello Chris hey
how you doing how you guys doing you can
answer that in the YouTube comments
below I'm sure Chris will read all of
them about how you are doing and your
life stories today we're talking about
character and ship and other types of
customization we just spoke about
procedural generation that should be in
the sidebar or something on YouTube and
yeah we're just gonna jump into
customization here so what what are the
main types of aspects of the game you're
hoping to allow customization and
regarding characters ships organizations
well all of they both know so I mean
like I think one of the you know big
ideas for starters it's a big sandbox so
you know I think we want what we want to
do is have a whole level of
customization so you can customize your
character your appearance you mail your
female what you look like
obviously you can buy different outfits
so how you look how you dress then on
the ships themselves you know we view
the ships as a character in themselves
and so there's a huge amount of
customization that we are sort of
allowing like all the ships are
basically you know right now when you
play arena commander
you know the Hornet has I think about 50
different items plugged into it so the
way you customize is like everything
like the radar or the targeting computer
or your weapons or your coolers your
power plants your thrusters your shield
they're all items that plug in and
obviously you can have different kinds
of items different levels you know some
will draw more power somewhere way more
somewhere require more CPU cycles and so
we know one of the things that we think
is that you know besides people like
upgrading getting different ships
they'll probably be buying different
equipment a better better gun or you
know a more powerful powerplant but of
course I'll always be trade-offs right
so if you have a bigger power plan is
going to weigh more and you know then
you may have to like sacrifice something
somewhere else or if you have a really
strong shield generator that will
probably draw more power so you may not
have as much power for your guns and so
people will really be able to sort of
customize the loadout
and the functionality of their ships
just based on the items and then on top
of that we want to be able to sort of
let players sort of customize their ship
in terms of appearance so you know be
able to paint them with some decals name
this year so that's some Rd we're still
doing for this sort of being able to
sort of paint your ships to do that you
know your characters and your ships and
actually all the buildings in the world
all also sort of change they aged with
time and all the rest of stuff which is
pretty cool and you know it's a huge
amount of stuff to customize and you
know the same approaches apply to the
organizations which is sort of you know
less something that you know physically
you have in the game but more of a group
and we allow you know players to sort of
just determine what kind of organization
they have give different names for the
ranks and as we go forward as it gets
more and more developed you know they'll
be able to control like the you know the
you know the fees people pay to be in
the organization how the money spent all
those kind of things so there'll be a
huge amount of ability for people to
sort of basically run a you know an
organization is the equivalent of I
don't know you want to call it a
corporate corporation or something and
so it would be happy want to run it but
you know it can be run like a government
or it can be run like a you know
for-profit corporation or it can be run
like a you know non for profit
corporation or just run it like a
friends list with a really flat
hierarchy however you want so so I mean
I think that we're really going to try
to let players kind of define their own
character and ship and groups to sort of
build their own experience inside
statuses and and that's one of the core
sort of approaches that we're taking on
the design in terms of in terms of
aesthetics for the let's start with the
ships specifically what are the plans
for painting versus decals yeah will
they be able to paint the primary buffer
panel or random components of the ship
well I said the good question so that
does actually stuff we're doing like
graphics R&amp;amp;D work on how we're going to
achieve that so they're you know
obviously you know there's a lot of
complications because you know because
there's an open
box a memo you know you could have a
hundred people showing 100 different
ships or with a hundred different paint
schemes and we start to get into
problems and like texture memory and all
the rest and stuff so we're sort of
looking at some different solutions you
know the simple one obviously is you
know you've got a primary and secondary
color and you can sort of pick those
then you can sort of overlay some decals
on but potentially there's an
opportunity for people to sort of you
know create their own sort of decals or
do their own custom paint jobs but of
course then you need a certain amount of
like oversight so people don't do the
inevitable flying penises so but we're
just in the early stages so I'm we're
not quite sure how far we can take it
you know something like I forget the
name of it now but it was by the grand
theft auto guys but it wasn't grand
theft auto I had a really good
customization stuff all points in make a
PP that's right a PP so a PP has some
really nice customers so we've looked at
that and we're looking at some of the
stuff that Yvonne line does with their
characters and so we're you know we're
gonna we're gonna try to do as the best
we can that will work inside the
constraints of the universe and we're
also going to have some kind of level of
rules of limits because we don't want
sort of the immersion breaking like
weird-looking characters or like really
obnoxious paint jobs and stuff like that
but it's still early too early to say
quite how far we can go with it but we
are trying our best to try and have
something that really allows people to
sort of customize their characters and
ships and stuff like that so potentially
what I'm hearing is it sounds like maybe
a racing game approach where you've got
liveries primarycolour secondarycolour
you might run into resource issues on
the system side well that's sort of that
that's sort of the fallback so you know
that we're pretty confident that we can
do that but we would like to go further
beyond that so that's kind of what we're
doing the research there's a whole bunch
of sort of like kind of different
texturing methods that potentially would
enable you to sort of kind of planned
you know
sort of
stencils on top of textures and bake it
all together but you know nothing's been
finalized yet we're just in the R&amp;amp;D
phase and moving on to characters I was
reading in some of the forum posts by it
was one of your one of your lead
developers I forget which department but
he mentioned issues with model height
and model width in terms of weight with
animations obviously so what are your
plans for customization of the character
in terms of face body type well I think
I think in general sort of the height
has to be in a certain range for you to
sort of fit in cockpits
that doesn't mean that like characters
can't be taller or shorter than others
but that would be in sort of things like
your like head versus like you know your
arm reach your leg reach because
everyone needs to be able to reach the
controls so and then in terms of body
types you know we sort of we definitely
want to have sort of the the thin normal
fat kind of set up but you know it would
probably be in such a way that again it
would you know be able to work in you
know standard chairs and cockpits so you
know we you couldn't really be Jabba the
Hutt basically right but you know you
could be someone with a paunch as
opposed to a you know six-pack or
whatever so that that's kind of the the
the approach mean from the NPC side we
probably would we'll be able to be more
extreme on it because obviously we don't
have to worry about fitting into every
single cockpit of every single ship but
for the player side we have to have some
constraints or else it becomes a
complete nightmare in terms of like you
know controls and customization all the
rest of stuff are you
are you considering more of a sliders
approach to face and body type
manipulation or a preset approach if you
see it I'm getting at thank you much so
that's all stuff that we're in the
process right now of our doing so we're
looking at both the slider also the
preset approach again I think I said
earlier that I we don't want people to
be able to like make like you know
freakish looking people so you want
people to look like reasonable so what
I'm gonna have us a bunch of different
presets and be able to blend between
them via sliders so you know you can
pick you know I don't know five preset
of 10 preset chins and you can still it
slide between them and say my nose is
say when eyes are so it'll enable you to
like come up with realistic looking
results but not necessarily something
that just doesn't look like a would any
human would look like and moving to
clothing what are the where will players
get clothing how will they be able to
customise it well I mean playthings
gonna be you know you know generally you
go down on the planet you go into a
store there'll be stores that sell
clothes as well in store that sells you
know guns for your spaceship or
spaceships and yeah I mean they'll be
like the real world you go in you know
you'll see oh yeah I want to buy that
out that Jack in we definitely want to
have a bunch of stuff that's specific to
areas in space you know so like maybe
there's a planet that's known for its
leather and that's where you go to get
this really badass leather duster and
you cut you don't get that somewhere
else because it'd be really nice to sort
of have clothes that are sort of tied to
locations so you can sort of see what
someone's we're look the visited that
one I got this got this you know jacket
or whatever so yeah basically that's
going to be pretty conventional you'll
go into stores you'll buy you know
outfits and you know some kind of
outfits will be available most places or
something like I said will be
location-based and players will also
have some control over stations in space
any plans to allow customization there
or is that fairly fixed yeah I mean so
well so there's you know give me two
levels I'll be the space stations that
players can take over which will be sort
of in the persistent universe but not
persistent they'll be instance and then
they'll be put areas that they'll be
space stations asteroid bases that will
be have a single instance and players
can take over and then on that level
they could take them over and I think
that the you know we're thinking of the
locations that players can own there'll
be some level of customization they can
do to it in terms of like expanding
capacity rooms
whatever chairs beds all that kind of
stuff it's kind of we're gonna be
prototyping with the hanger system so
the hang of the new hanger system that's
based on the room system which is sort
of like the system that will underpin
all the stuff on the planet side so
sharps bars the hangers allows the
ability to sort of add sections to the
room basically and so we'll probably
have a certain amount of that that will
you know it will be prototyped on the
hanger but it will be obviously we can
use it for other things like potentially
a space station or an asteroid base
where people could just say okay well I
want to customize out this thing I have
and I want to add an extra yeah whatever
reception room or something like that
and finally for our last topic of
customization will look at ship tuning
which we've we spoke about way back in
December of 2012 I think during the
technology interview you mentioned
specifically to think of shipbuilding
like building a computer you can
overclock components things like that
pick and choose your cpu your power
supply what's the extent of tuning in
terms of things like the engine how much
control will the players have well I
sort of it's going to sort of depend I
mean the tuning I mean like I think I
mentioned is that like some of the items
will have an ability to perform above
their sort of designated rate just like
a CPU would but when you overclock them
they emit a lot more heat and they drill
more power and so it's sort of like an E
and you also won't know where the
ceiling is on the item so you'll they'll
be just like chips so like some will be
able to overclock you know quite a lot
and some won't be able to overclock very
much at all so you know when an item
gets created there's going to be a you
know essentially a random number that
also say you know okay this is you know
this can be has a potential yield from
110 to 130 percent so then you know when
the item is created okay it's one
hundred and twenty two percent or
something and then the player if he's
willing to experiment and there will be
some downside to it because he could
also damage the item I can see if he can
get beyond the baseline performance
specs and then and we're sort of going
to have a sort of
bench or whatever that will be sort of
an addition that you can have to your
hangar you can kind of do some of this
stuff for and then you can have your own
special upgraded or you know overpowered
item that you can plug in and then a but
of course like I said there will be you
may need extra cooling you may need
extra power to take advantage of that
but your gun may you know hit 10 percent
and 15 percent harder if it's been tuned
what's your vision for the inner for the
user interface for this for the tuning
actions well so that's that's still too
early so we're still in we're still in
the prototype phase of that trying to
figure out like this is essentially a
bit of a minigame so with you know
trying to figure out what would be a
good way to do that so to speak like
what would be a way to make it kind of
fun and be in fiction so you know I
don't know if like we're you know we're
out of bench and you put the item there
and you see this sort of sign you can
push it and you've got a certain amount
of time to hit it and if you see it's
going to heart you bring it down and not
ever those are all the sort of things
we're sort of playing around and
prototyping with but hopefully it will
be something that we kind of fun for
people to do and then also you know the
upside is oh look I've got this you know
much more powerful weapon because you
know you put some time into it and there
is some risk like I said I mean if you
don't tune it properly you have a power
you could damage your weapon just like
if people are playing arena commander
you know they can overheat their Gatling
guns and do damage to it and let's throw
in one final community question just to
set the get it on the record for the
redditors who asked field of fuel to be
right now is limited because we're in an
alpha still are you planning to allow
players to tweak field of view or expand
it at all or well I don't so we're
playing around we're gonna do some stuff
with the field of view in terms of when
you fly around like for instance in
release 13 which is V zero point nine
which is dropping about a week when you
go faster your field of view will narrow
you know we'll get a little bit of a
shake to give you a sense of speed so
we're gonna play a field of view
dynamically in the cockpit I'm not sure
we're gonna let you like just do
whatever you want to do with the field
of view because in some ways it can be
sort of giving you too much
I mean you shouldn't have a field of
view that should be you know realistic
so to speak so you know what someone to
have like this crazy field of views they
can see people behind them because I'll
give them an advantage in combat so we
haven't really decided about the field
of view maybe and they'll probably a way
that you can sort of like zoom in and be
wide sort of kind of a scoping in
they're already kind of is something
like that but it needs a lot more work
but I doubt we'll just let people be
able to say oh yeah my field of use 180
degrees because I just think it would
not not be fair to everyone when you're
in sort of more competitive or a
dogfighting setup sure sounds reasonable
to me so as always links in the
description below for all the content
check the YouTube channel for the
previous video which was on procedural
generation and thanks as always Chris
for your time thank you thanks for
listening guys thanks for guys out that
of back to us ISM thank you for
supporting and hopefully you're liking
everything you're seeing so far and if
not I'm sure I'll hear from you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
