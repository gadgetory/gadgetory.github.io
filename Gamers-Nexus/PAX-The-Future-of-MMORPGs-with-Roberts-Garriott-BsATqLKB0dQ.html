interesting animals are as industry a
jicama different now just ten years ago
and everything was trying to be back on
the success of something else or see now
is revolution of internal where people
are remaining online system expansion
churches you got a stud a theory
successive sailing experience isn't only
predict what's happening however there
are a bunch of people still baconator
trying to predict what's going to happen
and that's how do we have here today
solicitor countries and we're going to
get the right to the industry save us
from our hands and then wear it with
everything
questions for any of you guys the games
of the making about games he made the
past since a way to it first oh man I
know you are mentioned irrelevant I
guess cover first time travels and we
got the response of founder of our a
science
and we have richard garriott syringe
itself
that's what L need some outlet design
takes rich
okay we start out there with that when
you tell us where you think each other
is headed home and triangles sure first
off amazingly accurate prediction to the
teacher promise so yeah probably
probably funny it's a bestie and they
did we do main things of that record in
a future of a necessity I wanna is
really resonates present hastily rain
shine
hello Joe is it really strong emphasis
on user-generated so most assets are
made on me our users to use fossil
evidence awkward it was a good game
credit danger bridges so you know that
sir all straining I think they really
nice here I as of small people allows a
huge amount stuff in they would not be
there
you know it has a new choices or below
by outside which lets people get into a
situation or equally quickly as our
bathing things that they interview you
know
very common is really where s thank you
very much and solo I work for dollars
we're making a pattern online it's a
fancy sandbox MMO and we are completely
focused on community and I think that
that's a huge stretch with a lot of
parcel since you're rapidly so we raised
a little early NOS ok service
overcrowded and we are a nation process
of iterative development are being all
proud we've asked them join us to
participate from the very earliest part
of our games i'm in helping crap how do
you play what woody systems are admitted
any word with Avilan and my you simply
feedback on me as a building we're going
to eat rating and be back online and
alternating a prostitute power their
strategies employed we start precautious
about earlier woman on your say and
early roman is an opportunity people
that are interested in playing army kind
of a very beginning on its evolution
it's what we call most men with 90 pots
an MVP so it's playable at all the sport
functionalities makes but it's got its
very beginning stage of iteration so
everything to be was a little bit rough
and polished and still has that kind of
memory on
we're a really good suggestion to have a
material impact on how to alter the
future so the people that are playing
right now aren't just playing in
development code assignment in order to
make that work will be incredibly
engaged our community have to work
really hard to find all the plays you
can to interact with them and I think
that's a huge challenge for for anybody
was doing them a creative work everybody
in this space has ideas really big is
the right thing viewing within the rec
league with their product and the idea
to go out in your community and say
we're going to show you how to do this
and exceptional me back and then listen
to what you say and I shouldn't change
it is really challenging and in order to
make that I think that√≠s values you can
we have to get as many venues so we're
always looking for new ways to find that
outreach pointed to make the connection
with our our player community really a
chain with this big one so I find online
it's all about being part of the proud
about for troops that happen right now
thank you very much John Peters your
music all right ah what is really loving
people right so feature baby
my suspicion is what we're going to see
rising to the top is good it's really
bad this monster maybe that's how i did
it and they like that's good for driving
me absolutely gonna be a harissa play
together and a lot of age ago that way
thinks he'll talk about with the genre
in my head to the cross river that's not
true at all lechon that's all I saw it's
just about behind there's a lot
definitely down there may be the
definition changing but ultimately
people looking for salads laughter
that's weird i would say a lot of ones
being so obviously a wealthy plants and
animals and things i would say one of
the transit IC would definitely
people drink is sort of like we'll get
an traditional fashion white people to
say rashmi on my way to play at
different levels do different things
playing with options where local people
or practically walk around the world
itself in rats pregnancies potentially
interactive the place is also experience
I would ever say kind of freedom or some
oxy service levels I think future you
sing a lot in games in general so to see
games will excited I 55 miles it's
variously open-world sandbox do what you
are play the place out and so the media
fashionbag so share that experience with
people because the world today is to
change too much more immediate of real
people to street that game right so
people are like greatest thing when we
release a new version say a really
clever
online within 30 bitch see people
screaming okay and see how the plan see
how they like that you've got all the
way she flies you get the sort of
consensus of feedback charity I think
that things you will be definitely needs
of our games tools of paths we go to the
church at to incorporate melodies way
different formats of time to mommy's not
be so seven to one side okay i would say
that persons of interest doesn't simply
be nice also unnecessary of that really
have usually great examples might be
sure to automatically messages for you
person but its affiliate where's the
radio station i could help us also to
having a good examples of the way I see
all my name's so physically game for
future it's sort of not just I don't
think you really want to exist Italian
single man Harrison games they'll still
be fed on her husband also level who
wasn't asking and you should be
experience for some shared experience
how you re so for musicals and the last
official stand course mine definitely
that I think I got engaged to iterate
and possibly try
is in CA IRA real gently i proceed when
you are willing TV are you jesting say
that's really hard to get a chance upon
some peanuts after a while or at least
the way things are some nice things
about Allah games is a lot suppose you
can know who's on top keep on iterating
on features I think they may be no you
guys think all of us is having a process
happening the whole game since to
getting us feedback rapture I think lot
Genesis it will make that there it also
said this is really a chat safina love I
think gentlemen Jessica happens with
your joystick fat side just our necks
it's just a guess I wish we could get is
composed about see back there said one
can see general trends and irritation
things will host it is great way to make
a game I think being on my last unit is
impossible deliver and elastic travel
would say is a
working creating tools or situated uses
people make the game happy responsible
for a lot of the trauma so it's always
possible bill linear scripted content
and how people experience it you never
know the classics keep up with my ways
so the best thing is i think we square
this lightly cell phones also systemic
or procedural style design when you
create rules the world great let's have
lots of things how they interact against
each other then you put it out there and
then let play themselves you know create
actions movements and that itself in
fall campaigns calls and that's me a
nationalistic sites in car but i think
the future of service and atmosphere on
citizens just to see what happens when
hundreds of thousands of people let
loose in polite world I can already see
in the forum or you got various groups
organizations together make the
concentrate on stage girls you know
crate-trained empires and just put is
well with the ruleset house of it see
how I didn't ask about I think that's
kind of the potential of you
hi girls so I start the avatar and one
of the first goals for us to really
impassively thought would be the
appropriate spiritual successor to our
early Earth guilty series about the solo
very serious nine where they invented
the term at bar that users were with
hold on I and then up to the terminal
RPGs and so Scotty up to both have
hearkened past and making those
vestments forward we also create new
technologies the mountable aspect of
motive another client server we created
a new model everyone's computers are
part of the server has the surprise
simultaneously on their machine it let
people play so they're offline was a
group people individually than off of
those of a work search our subscription
fee for into their house and we lower
our cost is impossible Boston players we
also had to fix some of the things I
think went wrong with only names in
general especially most you know if the
resulting games have very complex user
basics you know my name's you have had
things I hate attack feeling or besos en
casa spell Zeman profit item always been
a six letters and I read it
use item 11 list oxy me two icons and
Isis a huge improvement but I think in
order to all people not have copious
notes draw a mask we've made not only
answer to bring dead I actually think
that was rather useful experiences you
spend already character creator because
you know if it existed in later suits
and Allergan haven't we ever played in
and all wrong and you sit down we're all
in beautiful than you see estimation
points overall we talk to you could not
think we pissed off get things your
quests are anything never take this long
senior or the map if all the early map
your destination and your peeps serious
level gauge to slaughter creek I mean a
full description legend it is wrong I
didn't did it isn't it help people span
the audience but I think we have
underestimated the intelligence of our
audience and so one thing you want to do
is replace those strokes the table
attempt at ropes the marriott me better
we always so far and
innovative drink face combat there's
lots you know writing fiction short cut
our zoom in my memorized your quickest
cycle in most damage over time attention
to we do who also believe in things like
user created content so we leave in late
immunity and early often is my quality
and takes money but the power that
because we also put crowded money your
money we feel this deep obligation to
make sure you're providing an
entertainment along the way so if it
makes you badly you know cuz off you all
as must be good for developing the dark
and so for 15 months now we released on
the third Thursday among the bonus of
time and we had shipped to the minute on
time 15 months in road and since the
people November the infections IRS day
seven days a week and we servers in all
50 months publishes and all four months
of life service has crashed exactly
never and be transaction a lot of it
releases the come out and recent weeks
you know these things are very being the
great god bless a great article single
level especially those launch of the
spin them
my team lightning-caused decision
process because we are truly agile
development which people talk about a
lot and really actually do because we
have all of you in there with us on this
journey it allows us to make sure
mistakes respond your needs and make the
end I think will be more fun play and
technically a better service for Richard
actions have tweet and says okay I guess
good questions wits are fighting it now
on my phone Gary our man right there you
sure he's gonna be staying there too if
you start to kind of goes along with leo
is also being microphone technology to
try to push a short just one I got
question email server that
and so well for example in contrast to
those two things competitions and combat
you know when you get to mid new base
composition for them to produce
complexity people from the boat en
pointe claire tell me on skype a fond
memory name job alpha and was P word it
used to be in Ultima situation to
tighten and track out are you you can
walk up to the are concurred in a hub
you can say they've all been some places
it's entirely you can say hello my name
is experience what is your name I'm
interested in all the beverage but
that's a beer on tap return and he will
say hello Richard period my name is
Thomas the barkeep yes we serve hail and
so maybe we don't have a school sentence
Arsenal in keywords we're going way that
means that we can very true Clues where
you're cold go as a moment about the red
dress and some see it's not any trouble
in engineering ever literally remember
that commando
reading your journal and there's no
class law as after you decide but it
looks like it feels like and such that
information house conversation sort of
our own they come back as opposed to
having Shikamaru reset skills and we're
using a real time more like a part of
that dealing system where if I know how
to our tree and some sword if I'm thank
the whole marching this group I'll go
back and build a deck out of those
skills they want to think of hearing
combat it will show up a basic on how
I've prepared my skills pull that
particular mr. Robinson what is your
feelings why did you playing are making
oyster to the Rose logos did you see I
guess how much it
crowd funding is doing I mean I have
eight ly I mean I owe my son and I think
that the attraction because I mean I
also fact plenty of other people but the
crowd fund is that it's nice if I put my
game a hat on I think it's nice and I
get to pick and choose the game that I
want to see happen and i also like
obviously make games so i sort of air
into the making of games but i
definitely think the people that don't
even make games that like to know about
making games are these people to watch
movies i'd like to know who watched
behind with scenes on the end of the DVD
and i think that there's something
really special about the interaction
that you can have between the people
making the games of the people playing
the games as you're making them they can
make a better game now I've never made a
game this way before all my old games
we've done the traditional way in the
publishing system but for me it's way
more energizing it to make its way fun I
don't know what there's a weird feedback
with bag and so I mean I would you know
the rest of the panel here could but but
for me I actually prefer it as a
development methodology I like being
open I like sharing things are excited
by I like getting the feedback and you
know it feels more immediate and instant
and closer to what today's world is
which is today's world is much more
shared and instead of the media and I
sort of feel like it is 10 it will prep
I'm not saying it'll be the only way but
it'll definitely be one of the major
waves of games get made in the Opera
that's um that's actually folks I kind
of want to hear what John and Adam have
to say because they're with traditional
publisher developer situations will
start with Adam and go to John event
right and Richard kitchen come into so
yeah trove is not crowd funded and you
know we are a publisher but we get a lot
of
benefits I think that you get from
crowdfunding you know we did like an
early supported program which you know
we got a lot of good response to and I
think I think speaking what he said that
you know one of the primary benefits is
the sort of immediacy you know your
connection to the customer you know
connection to their feedback and their
involvement in the development of the
project that to me is the most valuable
thing from crowdfunding and for you know
any developers and small teams you know
obviously you can't even do the project
without the crowdfunding so it's pretty
Tim important in that capacity but you
know it's a real boon for I think the
development process as well you end up
with a much better product and the
people who you know particularly that
are early supporters are more invested
more likely to spread the word to their
friends you know they're generally very
loyal customers if you don't screw them
over so you just don't don't do that you
know give them a good game to play and
you know reward their early their early
support and you know it's just all
outside yes me how many times if
somebody like a developer spent five or
seven years making a game and comes out
maybe it's not what somebody wanted you
know what I mean it's backfires okay
John how do you feel about yeah well it
seems like somehow we're good lating
crowdfunding with like talking to our
fans like we don't you don't need your
fans to give you money to talk to them
it's great like I don't think
crowdfunding is a bad way to be funding
but it has nothing to do with how you
interact players right like we
definitely don't have any guild wars 2
crowdfunding obviously it's a big game
at this point but there's we're still
here like a show when we come down and
we are on Twitch we let go on the twitch
streams to talk to our fans and that's
we're going up we go on reddit and we
post
read it you know and it's not like all
of a sudden that has to change because
we're not proud about it so want to make
sure we like separate those two topics
yeah really not the same thing right
you're talking about difference between
crowdfunding and open development just
happens that open development happens to
go have it has a crowdfunding you can
evoke the development without crashing
yeah it can be the trend that I was sort
of talking tilly's the open development
aspect I think is something that you're
going to see yeah absolutely would be
known like even in its a publishing a
crowd from that aspect is the power on
the game aside to be able to choose what
things are getting made versus is chosen
publishing it says I would green like
voting on a road map and that kind of
thing like what's more important to
develop you let the fans shoes
essentially yeah well and I'm going to
follow you know that I can't tell you
how many times we would get to the point
of making the next Ultima when my
publisher whether it was my brother or
electronic arts would come to me and go
Richard people are tired of being
oriented stuff or talking to orbit
people are tying to be tired of being
running around as a man in tights this
medieval stuff is dead everybody's
either watching Star Wars or the matrix
why don't you put everybody in trench
coats give glasses sunglasses and I want
to buy that name and and I'm sending oh
I like well face him to that see how
future yeah and so what's going on here
and so I really do think that the
crowdfunding part of it is is important
if you know what I have any of you call
me to task you commented you call to
task we have excess praise please don't
lawyer us grow because people will go
through the minutiae of what we barber
said online or presented
dokumenty where I go this is what I paid
money for I've been on this as you said
it was gonna have pink hats and you're
gonna be blue hats I want the pink hats
you promised me and and I'd much rather
have that because at least as people who
care and are playing and did at least
buy it is something that we were
actually talking about doing even if we
might commence with the little details
it is such a breath of fresh air not to
have to argue with people as to the
fundamentals of is your game worthy Ryan
you have anything in yeah hey so I want
to make fantasy role-playing game NASA
multiplier and nobody in the industry
none of the people with the money want
to fund that game if it wasn't for
crowdfunding games like the games that
I'm making that Richards making would
not be being made right at the end of
its cycle it was costing over a hundred
and fifty million dollars and five to
seven years of time and a team of five
hundred to a thousand people to make a
triple a few parking them up and they
didn't recoup their investments and so
nobody will fund them so we want to keep
making MMOs we have to find a new way to
do it and the success of being able to
crowdfund an MMO means there's going to
be new MMOs because if there wasn't
crowdfunding there wouldn't be any in
development right now that's the
difference between crowdfunding I'm not
proud next question
it must be
actually kind of want John to start off
with that one because you guys did the
whole thing where it was you know new
content every two weeks for like several
muscle design but I since the seventh
month yeah so why I mean you have a
pretty good idea I mean not surprisingly
it creates a little bit of entitlement
which is fine but its true like you know
and that's a thing that is we're fine
people are gonna think everyone here is
happy to live with because we know that
there are people that are excited about
the game but it definitely is it because
it's a much more difficult process than
what we've ever done before with a live
game simply because this year this
feedback isn't always from people who
are developers they don't understand
that sometimes like that thing that
sounds like is easy is actually hard
sometimes the thing that sounds like it
heart is hard it's actually really easy
to do why did you give us like why did
it take you a year to fix the camera
well a 3d math is really hard and
cameras are really hard right like how
but you guys changed bless this skill
lid what one minute well yeah it's like
a number in a database and music but
they just don't understand that and
that's fine but it definitely creates a
lot of tension and so you have to work
really really hard to kind of keep in
communication be open when those people
explain why these things take time
explain why these things don't take time
explain what things were you're capable
of doing so it's a lot about just being
upfront that that model is created just
a need for communication I think
basically I don't ask question you're
quite your questions more about like
what new sort of things can happen in
the game because of this loop right not
so much what are the challenges of
having that constant feedback yeah
just how it kind of changes your
dynamics developers and farther is there
10 minutes is there something well okay
yeah so so so the positive side of it
that I will see is that you can react
like if you're on a much faster like
content opapp cycle and you're getting a
video feedback you can actually react
and sort of yeah maybe not exactly real
time for very close to real time so what
the players doing which means that your
experience you can sort of Game Master
for player base is is much more reactive
to what they're doing right so it could
be more akin to an old-school Dungeon
Master playing D&amp;amp;D seeing what the
players are doing and riffing off them
and work with them so that's what I
actually think the potential of the
instant feedback and the quick drops and
everything and that's definitely what we
plan Utley one star citizen a pretty
calm for Richards exactly a lot on board
with the others on the same side so
talked about it kind of one of the sort
of things we think it's cool but that's
what's exciting to me because like for
what's exciting to me is the energy of
the player base and what they do in the
groups and you sort of see stuff and I
can see what types of look at we try to
have a person and you do the community
videos and we have the same link we have
some we have some people that do this
amazingly they take the assets out of
our bills and they put these okay this
is what it's like to be a pirate
reporting to ship well this is what it's
like the scavenge stuff and now even on
our development side you know we're
working on these systems but I can
almost oh yeah look at this YouTube
video that's exactly the visual of what
we're trying to design
and so it's a really incredible sort of
feedback loop and I think that the more
sort of if you can create tools that
allow you to sort of change and edit
stuff in real time and that really works
if you've got more procedural kind of
systems for like Howie Rai sort of
reaction here it can't just be just
simply I like tactical stuff it's sort
of more this matter a I where a is have
their own goals want to be a you know
the top dog pirate or they want to be
the best trader and you have all these
things that you can basically add on the
developers side you can sort of take a
few knobs you know turn a few dials and
advil elbin in here and all of a sudden
you could do something that will react
to something you just seem to play a
bass ooh I think that will create an
experience for the players that will be
amazing because then they'll be like oh
my god you know it's like all of a
sudden my actions and there's a reaction
to it and it doesn't feel like you're
sort of playing and it was you know
that's the old theme park and I'm own
kind of trope which is like you build
this content it's like really
beautifully architected and scripted but
it's like you know takes you so long you
know you're not going to do another one
for another year and it one sort of
plays it and they go through it it's why
you see world of warcraft it's like the
other soaps go off and then there's a
new release and in fact up to 10 million
they have one runs through all the
content and then they wait around for 19
months and then they do it again so i
think the real possibility of so that
real-time feedback is the ability to to
create the world in a way that it feels
more alive more reactants the players
and therefore I think would be much more
sort of compelling in the most
experienced and do they want
I was curious the challenges development
and content and mmos sequel when your
new expansion of coming news revisiting
storylines and characters and locations
that exist our generation so how do you
apprised those things originally for an
audience that wants both knowledge style
I mean it's it it's really a question I
think for everyone here could be honest
because you know everyone here is
working on upon online games there's
already lots of online games there's
already expectations for what an online
game is it just doesn't just apply to up
to August making guild wars lon and
Gilbert's to like we have expectations
for guild wars 2 has all the
expectations of guild wars one and all
the expectations of wow and all the
expectations of Ultima Online like all
are heaped upon like you know whatever
and that happens to every game as it
gets released like you know destiny was
supposed to have like do everything that
every other game had ever did add better
like every that's that's sort of is the
general feel right that like every game
has all those things heaped upon it and
so what you have to do at least I
believe is think about what you are
trying to do and make the decisions that
make like this is what we think is the
right direction this is what we think we
game that we want to make them game that
we think players want to make and we've
talked with them and then you work
towards that and you have to accept when
that's not going to meet their
expectations and understand that because
we're not meeting those expectations for
creating new ones that you didn't think
you wanted right so the is there's a
balance in there and that's basically
what it comes down to it saying anybody
else want a mortal enemy oh yeah I I
think that it kind of ties in a little
bit with the previous
question insofar as I think it's a lot
easier to work on a game it doesn't have
as many expectations is that it's not
nearly it's not your mic there's
actually like a trash and slowly rolling
down okay fix you for good apparently he
doesn't realize anyway it's a next job
your hero it's not that microphone
either anyway there's a certain there's
a certain level of freedom that comes
along with you know having fewer
expectations and you know kind of be
able to define your game and a little
bit more of a vacuum which is assisted
so strongly by the rapid iteration
process right like the more quickly
you're able to go from you know design
decision to implement it in the game and
get feedback like the less time at
laughs is there the faster you kind of
find you know what you're really trying
to do is you don't always know you know
it's like you have ideas of what's going
to be fun you don't know it's not always
fun you know your ideas are frequently
not fun you have to figure out how to
make them fun how to make them work how
to you know make them beneficial to the
total framework your project and you
know the rapid iteration time helps a
lot and you know freedom from
expectations also helps a lot go ahead
yes speed round questions actually we
have time because we started like we got
time
my brother's death
roll stars subscriptions be better TV
fans and much closer look at how do you
okay um we can kind of start with
Richard should work our way down sure so
by the way I think all of those
financial models are acceptable and I
expect you'll see most all those
continue to exist but at least my
feeling is that you know if we do our
job right as developers we get the costs
of operating the business down as low as
possible so that I so that we have our
we're open to find the most friendly way
to charge people for things so in our
case we've specifically worked to get
our server and electricity costs down on
the back side so that we can run the
service perpetually just on a retail
sale now as a business we still want to
make more money and so we're happy to
sell some larger pieces of property
which have you know no real influence on
gameplay to people who are willing to
help support the development of the game
as a out of way thank you for for
joining us on on the trip but the one
we're trying to specifically avoid is
the Facebook era constant dribble of
real money coins that has to take place
to keep the gameplay going for you in
any practical sense so that's the only
one that I kind of look at is maybe not
eat maybe evil might be overstated but
at least offensive at least to me almost
anything else I think you'll still see a
lot of include subscription I think it's
perfectly fair so some of me the
economic I mean why delicately 2x1 a I
just like to be able to generate enough
I need to you know keep the server's
going and keep developing cool you
content but really I sort of look at the
model is based on what I would like as a
gamer so I just have my own stickam it's
not necessarily what other people would
like to go but I don't like
subscriptions mainly because I've had
lots of subscription MMO games that I
made for about a month and for that I
had a subscription it was keep me going
on and come back to it and I just sort
of felt like I don't like the obligation
of having to pay all the time so I sort
of preferred to be in a situation where
I you know you have to buy entry because
it definitely cost to build something
and develop something and have some
servers and then after that you know you
have some ways to bring more money in
but it's sort of more on an optional
basis so for instance you know people
have time and people have money and some
people have lots of time some people
have lots of money only willing to trade
it off right so I don't want it I don't
want to have a game that anyone is
disadvantaged by one of the other more
like anyone that has too much of one
resource should not have an overwhelming
advantage over anyone else other than in
the particular case of star citizen
skill so we're not going to legislate
for know if you're too skillful we're
going to you you'll be handicapped but
in terms of other resources with you
know there's lots of people that
basically have plenty of time and want
to just you know they're just never
going to see that they're going to get
the base shipping sauces and like all
the time in there we have lots of people
like that and then there'll be some
people that they're got a job when they
want to go and do some things and fly a
particular ship but they don't have the
time to play the game to get to that
part of you earn enough money to earn a
particular ships and they have the
ability to buy some credits and we're
limiting it to allow you to buy stuff in
game if you want which you're going to
have no matter what and every MMO
because even if you block it you've
still got gold farmers and people still
like try even if you prevent people from
transferring money between accounts
people just say here's my accountant is
my login info so that's always going to
go so my feeling is if that money is
happening I would rather in goes the
development of the game supporting the
servers and so on
else's pocket but I want to do it in a
fair basis where there is you know the
thing but the biggest thing for me is
the game players I don't ever want to
feel like I have to do something I don't
ever want to feel like I have to pay
money to you know get a better
experience and you know I don't ever
want to have the feeling which I
definitely had some MMOs in the past is
I don't want to have the base game play
beat not on this is definitely old
facebook Games's base gameplay is really
boring and tedious so you sort of occur
even though you don't have to use sort
of courage to to spend money i mean from
my standpoint you should just play in
the basic ship and have a really good
time actually playing against feather
and gets more money in the game you can
upgrade your ship and that's what
happened and whether or not the model
that we use for star citizen is the
right and probably want to I have no
idea it is literally the bottle that I
want I think it's that as a game player
and I'm hoping that it's going to be
good enough to label us to continue
running the game and the level of
mission we are and enablers to continue
to add more features with content has go
on that's kind of the plan I could be
completely wrong maybe we should be
non-subscription maybe we should be free
to play I have no idea but that's kind
of the way I made the choices on star
citizen junk and i'll be super quick
like for me personally i prefer to pay
nothing I don't want you said money on
anything I know played a lot of like
clash of clans I spent zero on it and
then I got tired of waiting you know I
just generally don't want to spend
anything and I think it's similarly
providing something with our philosophy
as a company which is being can
basically work hard to be everything we
spend is convenient or like you know
looks customization and avoid making
people spend money on gameplay as long
as there's no money on gameplay which
like it's hard to do you never know what
can do a thing you think it wasn't
gameplay and then for someone it is but
overall this as long as it's not money
play I think it's good well I feel like
a faucet so my philosophy is that I want
my interest to be in line with my
players interest and that means I want
to earn their money every month and I
think that any month when I don't earn
their money they shouldn't give me any
money and that means I wasn't successful
that month but if I'm not getting paid
for what I'm doing on a regular basis
I'm working for somebody in the future
I'm not working for the customers i have
right now if all i do is sell my product
once and then never generate any
additional revenue what that basically
means is that i'm saying that all the
work i'm really doing the passion that
I'm bringing in my product is designed
to get you to buy something from me
again in the future and I think it's a
lot better to say I want you to pay me
this month for this one's work I want
you to understand that the money that
you're putting into my company today is
going into the game that you're playing
today and maybe that's a subscription
maybe that's a micro transaction maybe
that's a hybrid between the two but I
think it's really important that my
interest in my players interests are
aligned and those alignments should be
making the game as good as we can make
it right now and I think that a funding
model that involves getting paid
regularly is the way that make that
happen well I certainly agree with John
and I have agree Ryan I think that you
know either being paid to win or being
perceived as pay to win is a real poison
pill for you know your your perception
amongst the community amongst your gamer
you know your your users your players
but you know we all live in the real
world right we got to make a dollar of
this like somehow or another so you know
our games are free to play game we have
a game store and you know you're able to
get sort of like speed up type stuff
right like your current crafting
materials things of that nature but you
can't get any power out of it that's the
important part you know so it is
cosmetic it's flash you know mounts
wings costumes things of that nature
right where it's about sort of status
being
you know different standing out right
spending money to do that but there's a
corgi mountain trove just so you know
what's a corgis yeah yes yeah we have a
whole line of court corgi based mountain
our game courses are getting in our
office and in all of our trying products
excellent probably as a result of that
yeah so you just got to make sure that
if you do have a shop if you're not
running a subscription that it's not
things that let you you know skip power
game or give you a substantive advantage
over people who aren't choosing to spend
money all right so real quick questions
and real quick answers let's do these as
fast we cam it would get to the end of
that line before the end yeah speed
runner I think it'll last forever I then
go alas river next like eight point five
years
as quick as possible guys let's do that
one okay I still sucks and it probably
will for a few more iterations yeah I
don't think you want two quick outs of
my internet the quantity of anything
that's going to the pneumatic players
you can simulate in real time in one
place is by far the biggest technical
challenges a lot of things that are
beyond just cpu power than 30 back so
basic design of the internet itself is
actually a real obstacle to that and
that's not as easy to fix and you know
things you know obviously GPU cpu
increasing will be able to render more
characters but whether you can transfer
that information fast enough that's
that's a pretty big challenge there is
definitely stuff which Richards doing
the cloud we're doing in the cloud where
if people shift to using more cloud
based computing scalability options then
there will be massive gains for it and
so it's a really cool tech that like
Google and even amazon and everyone is
what not to do that and those are the
one that I think that's people abrasive
that and not designing the old way way
an old MMO was made with like metal in
your own server room and figuring in a
sort of mod distributed basis which
should gain talking about the way try to
the avatar is distributing between all
its players are ways to get the player
counter properly in one area in real
time in high fidelity I think that's a
massive big engineering challenge but
you crack and I'll be really good and we
know John's answer is math no stay no I
mean it's like players in space right
like 300 players near each other it's
like 300 people sending to 300 right so
that's cool 500 players it is 500
players each one has to send it to 500
and I think
as bill said you can do the math after
that we're so right I'm from speedrun
I'm gonna sign are you guys yeah next
question to get the mind space how do
you do that at them you update all the
damn time you know I mean seriously you
want to be in people's faces you want to
show people what you're making as much
as you can all right you want to promote
your own your own game as much a you
know and that's that's something that I
think a lot of Indies run into the
problem like they can create a fantastic
game and have a real you know hard time
marketing it because that's just not
their wheelhouse so you know in order to
build that mind space like bill just
said you just have to be in their face
yet the interface push grassroots get
people to recruit their friends that's
prom on Pat let's give you the kind of
short your first boyfriend okay this is
it's how do you keep the net neutral
really yes keep the net neutral done
yeah keep the net neutral quickly
quickly biggest challenge the biggest
what Dover biggest challenge just as few
words as possible managing people for
the meeting player expectations yeah
that's good what to do goodbye should be
a developer giving a short answer
it's better from emergent community
standpoint to have global brothers at
the way wow this is the way of eating
dangers in some other games I think
there's no need to see more than a
hundred strangers around you any one
time because they're strangers look at
the room right now seriously yeah so
that's why I think I think interesting
works in that case what we do is try to
the avatars we drive a slice we actually
look at the fringe graph make sure we
don't separate anyway that actually
knows anybody from anybody else and then
separate them into temporary instances
that collapse as soon as the population
in sees low enough because again you
know sorry I'm insulting anybody but you
know most of you I don't know and so if
it was if it was other people than those
of you they're here now a random other
people I wouldn't know the difference
except for the people in the front row
and so make sure that you keep that
persistence for the things I can see and
everybody else might as well be an NPC
or in a different sense all right we got
four more questions its power through
give the rest of us some of the money we
mow the doubling staff by the way so the
question was what do I intend to i have
to do with the money well make the best
damn space in ever but that's all you
need to say what's that when it's ready
a very popular answer for us this game
good I'll just cuz i think it's the
trend and it's just like literally if
you if you look at the amount of effort
that you have to put into building
something of the quality people expect
now like you see how much money gets
spent in call of duty to do a five hour
campaign you know how to do it at that
level well gamers don't have any
appreciation of like well i saw that in
Call of Duty why can't I get that over
here in this game that I've got 400
hours of gameplay and so to be able to
sort of deliver large amounts of content
I think you've got to be smart as a
design around engineer figure out how
you can get that fidelity but in a way
that it's not going to take you four
thousand nine years to create so it's
definitely a blend of sort of procedural
like basically you sort of template
stuff up so you definitely design and
have artists feel some convention is
that in sort of templates and that it's
a matter of how you get these templates
to work together and then if they put
together intelligently they can come up
with like huge amounts of variety of
content and I think that one of the ways
to solve the problem of like really sort
of high fidelity and Connecticut MMOs
and I will a lot of quality content I
will respectfully disagree i'm a little
bit of a contrarian I still think
procedural stuff is great to give you
the baseline of a world that looks like
it naturally evolved but i think the
custom content as the final step on top
of that gives relevance and meaning to
the journey there won't come out of
procedure up to understand me you did a
deal around have a certified gentleman
yeah i want to contradict both of you
nah just it's about thing because it's
about the game right like their trove
like obviously it's not about like
constructing things right it's a you
know crowd like making stuff game like
right our game and that's what it's
about
and so that's like yeah we have those
people right and depends on what game
you're making yeah it's going to be a
fan of Minecraft and go i think i'm
going to play guild wars 2 because it's
like minecraft so and there's lots of
games and people like different kinds of
games so yeah alright ma'am it's better
be good that's a good one who wants to
start that doozy okay so what one
improvement you want to make for the
social aspect of MMOs to make it about
people again people as a group so one
things we're doing is we are getting out
of the business of competing with the
player social and crafting economy
everything they're all we put in the
game is raw materials and whether it's
art music songs stories anything else
we're giving the players the tools to be
able to do that and share with each
other so we're we're stopping we're
getting out of the business of competing
with them to create epic loot drops or
big events and i would say that what I
interested in is finding a way for the
players to communicate with each other
in the game in a much more sort of real
and emotional way so like for now it's
always been you ok I go on my chat
window and i chat to you but you know
even if you have a logitech webcam now
you can go in there and the logitech
webcam can put a silly shark face a
monkey face on your face you can
actually live track people's faces so
there's no reason with today's
technology that I can't have my avatar
icon sitting at my computer with a
webcam on me and I'm talking and you're
now i'm taking my voice and filtering it
on the other side based on my situation
when my location is whether i've got a
helmet at are and also animating my
avatars face so when I'm talking to you
you're actually seeing my avatar talk to
you versus you know seeing something a
chat window and I think if you can
manage to do some more of that kind of
stuff then you can have sort of
interactions between players and the
emotion of it be stronger than has
potentially been in the past so Richard
talked about like the room full of
strangers thing like everyone who's
playing an MMO right now like some of
the people you're playing with were once
strangers to you so I think it's riding
that line between making it so that you
can interact with your friends and also
still making you look for new people to
interact with that's probably one of the
biggest challenges I think we're on a
mission to bring back pvp in a
meaningful in a non-toxic way in a way
that it's going to make people view it
as a normal and accepted part of their
game experience that they enjoy because
it adds so much risk and danger an
interesting human meaningful human
interaction in the game experience you
know at first I was going to disagree
with Ryan but I think about all the dark
souls pvp have done and how sticky and
engaging that is and you know the sort
of good messages that go back and forth
when you have a good match and I think
he's probably right you know but I mean
that's sort of the competitive aspect of
you know fair play of kind of being cool
with each other but cooperative I think
is extremely sticky as well right and so
in our game you know people are in clubs
which are like our guilds and they do
these huge you know collaborative build
projects together you know with
different roles like Foreman directing
the worker bees who might not feel is
you know creative or whatever it in you
know in terms of positive interaction
that's extremely strong you know like
people feel really really good about
working together in these bills you know
same with minecraft and other voxel
based games and so you know in terms of
cooperative aspect I think that that you
know more and better ways to kind of
share your creations to get those out
through social media you know to stream
your creation on Twitch right all that
stuff I think will
push those things in a positive
direction as well all right we are we're
done guys I really appreciate y'all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
