nexus net and today we are talking about
star citizen's FPS module which was
unveiled finally at pax australia just a
few days ago the FPS module at the
unveil showed the game in action there
was actual first person shooter combat
some pretty standard CryEngine 3 type
stuff shooting really was somewhat
similar to what you would see in most
FPS games out these days there are a few
interesting elements that will get to
though first the roadmap the star
citizen roadmap was updated at pax
australia and the star citizen fan event
including notes on an arena commander
one point 0 update in late 2014 which
will introduce new maps introduced
racing at its entirety insofar as the
demo and a couple of other things new
weapons missiles things like that the
FPS module and planetside module and
arena commander 2 point 0 will be
launching in early 2015 some of those a
bit later than others planetside will
certainly come much later than the FPS
module and arena commander module 2
point 0 but the planetside system will
herald the arrival of squadron 42 s
first chapter which will offer 15 to 20
hours of gameplay it's quite a bit of
gameplay there for the first chapter of
star citizen's proper content will call
it as opposed to the alpha and beta of
gameplay mechanics so the FPS module as
unveiled we've spoken about this in
depth with Chris before you can see the
interview on the channel check that out
just search for star citizen on our
YouTube channel and he spoke in depth
about all the features planned for the
future for FPS but not all those will be
implemented right away it is an
iterative development in sort of the
agile scrum lifecycle so the FPS module
as showcased is really just a couple of
SMG type weapons a sidearm there's some
zero gravity and very dark hallways
which I think might be in part for
environment and atmospheric effect it's
very it's kind of foreboding and
claustrophobic with the the lights cut
will say on a space station I think it's
also largely because all the art assets
aren't done yet and they
to conceal that by limiting the lighting
which is the nature of an early
development game this also showed that
the combat is very standard for FPS the
SMGs just kind of takes a lot of shots
to kill someone not perfectly accurate
that you know there are iron sights just
like in cryengine three native there are
iron sights and then just reloading like
normal all that stuff's very standard
the defending team of this station or of
this ship whatever it may be did at one
point cut gravity which was pretty cool
so the one guy ran into engineering he
pulled a giant lever turned off gravity
and then everyone starts floating freely
and there will be gravity boots in the
future that if you have them you can
lock yourself to certain certain
elements or metal objects things like
that and that will aid greatly in FPS
combat especially if you are a boarding
party and that's where FPS really comes
into play with star citizen it is meant
to be something that is really truly at
its best when one party of players or AI
is boarding another party and attempting
to steal cargo attempting to steal a
ship attempting to disable certain
functions so in talking to Chris about
this his sort of vision is he hadn't
played battlefront 2 but I have and what
he was describing is similar to it in
that you can get on there get on the
ship look for their shield generator
disable the shield generator or look for
effectively a warp core not that that
really exists to the extensive star star
trek but you get the idea disable that
or disable weapons batteries and that's
the long-term view right now you can
turn off gravity and create an ambush
for the attacking players which is a fun
element I think that the actual
mechanics from what I've seen it's sort
of a weaker version of Crysis 3 don't be
too thrilled about this going into it
it's just an alpha you really need to be
careful with your your judgement here
but also be very careful with your
excitement because to be completely
honest and candid nothing really that
was shown is something worth getting
excited about it is not revolutionary
it's not going to break barriers it's
not
reducing anything that we haven't seen
before but it does show that the game is
being worked on it shows that FPS will
actually in fact be in this game so
that's sort of the update on star
citizen just from watching it and from
studying all the FPS footage studying
the live stream all this i would say
that there is promise there's some cool
things like shields that you can deploy
in a similar fashion to halo where you
just throw down an energy shield you can
do stuff with ambushes but again nothing
here is innovative so be careful with
your hype and as always really just
don't give too much money to a you know
to a crowdfunded game just be be
responsible and hear donations here even
though it does look pretty cool hype is
a very dangerous beast in the games
industry so that is all for this video
