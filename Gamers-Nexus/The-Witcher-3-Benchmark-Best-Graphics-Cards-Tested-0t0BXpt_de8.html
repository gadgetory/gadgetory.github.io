Donette and we have a huge amount of
video cards on the table right now
because I just got done doing a GPU
benchmark of The Witcher 3 and I worked
on this for about 7 p.m. on monday
through 9 a.m. on launch day and the
reason it took so long is because we're
very careful with our methodology to
make sure that the results are accurate
and that the representative of
real-world in-game used part of this
includes developing a custom in-game
benchmark where we look for various
objects in the game that reflect the
game settings so there's a lot of
settings in game water quality grass
density things like that chromatic
aberration and I try to include those
different elements of gameplay to ensure
that it is actually reflected in the
benchmark we also do multiple task
passes to eliminate outliers and then
average the results and further I
collect data on average FPS 1% low FPS
and 0.1 percent low FPS the percentages
are basically the 99th and 99.9
percentile framerate results within our
32nd testing period and these represent
dips and stuttering and very jarring
experiences to the user so these are
important numbers that can show when the
game will noticeably stutter while
you're playing it and it creates sort of
a hiccup in the environment where it
looks like the game briefly hangs onto a
frame a little bit longer than it should
so that's one of the things we're
collecting data on in these results The
Witcher 3 has a lot of settings that
aren't normally named in games so there
are some new settings here and it's not
quite as complex as GTA 5's very deep
settings but definitely worth going over
them briefly and I'll have a full
optimization guide online after this for
a brief overview of the settings present
a few of the unknown ones are in the
post-processing effects tab and these
would include things like chromatic
aberration which is a photography term
and it applies to the witcher 3 you can
enable it or disable it quite simply and
chromatic aberration is an effect that
exists in photography that is resultant
of the lens and how it interacts with
the light it's when the lens has
difficulty getting the color correct and
focusing on a certain color wavelength
when you're shooting a photo so in the
game this will be present mostly when
looking at light coming through windows
or light
shimmering around objects due to various
types of backlighting and that creates a
sort of glow around the object and it
makes it look a little less in focus and
this is actually intentional it creates
a cinematic effect this isn't something
you would really see in the real world
it's not something you see without a
lens for the most part so it is
definitely more cinematic and less
realistic in that instance but you can
enable or disable it does not have a
huge frame rate impact from what I've
seen so far but I haven't finalized
those tests there are also things like
vignette even yelling creates a soft
shadow around the center of whatever's
in focus so it creates a darkness around
the focused object and then you've got
depth of field which we've discussed
before DOF is another photographic term
it creates a level of depth and layering
to your shot where there's a bokeh
effect around the subject that's in
focus so if I'm in focus right now if we
had a lens with better depth of field on
this camera this wall would be more
blurred out these video cards might be
partially blurred out and then I would
be the most in focus so that gives you
an idea of what happens and this is
visible in the game as well and in GTA 5
bloom is another one this one has been
around for quite a while made a big
showing in Far Cry in the past and bloom
it creates a shimmering effect around
heat or light sources so in The Witcher
3 a good example would be fire if you
have an open flame and you have bloom
enabled you'll see a slight shimmering
over the fire and that's all that really
does it's just a filter and all the
post-processing effects are applied as a
filter atop the already rendered objects
models Polly's things like that and it
just sort of affects how you view the
game through the viewport so to speak of
the character in terms of performance
The Witcher 3 was actually fairly poorly
optimized as you'll see in these charts
and it ran not that great on SL I'd 90s
on a tight necks all the way down the
range definitely does not run too well
on AMD right now note that for these
tests we have the newest nvidia drivers
and we tried to use the beta AMD drivers
which are still ancient so to speak in
terms of drivers they go back to GTA 5
or before that even so the latest AMD
drivers are not optimized for the
witcher 3 and at
filming there are not new drivers that
are built for the witcher 3 so these
charts the numbers will change when AMD
does actually optimize their drivers for
the game to this end when trying to use
the 15 thought for drivers the beta ones
we found that there were issues
detecting some cards there were other
issues with crashing things like that I
had to roll back to the most recent
stable drivers which are very old I
think they're December and that's just
because AMD hasn't updated in quite a
while likely do the new video cards
coming out soon and that will probably
get the biggest push but Nvidia had game
ready drivers so you will see a
performance boost their sum and video
users on the 700 series of last
generation cards noted that they were
able to eliminate crashing by rolling
back to the previous gta5 drivers rather
than using the witcher ones let's talk
about the benchmarks already so at 4k to
sli gtx 980 sr barely able to run the
game at a playable FPS there about 10
FPS below where i would want them to be
ideally you sit at 60 and then a titan
axe is a little bit worse than those
this is known that the 1980s outperform
a tight next in most games when an sli
and that's just because the 12 gigabytes
of video memory doesn't do as much for
you as the added processing power of an
additional video card dropping down the
medium settings gets a bit more playable
but it's still a little rough playing
the game at 4k with any graphics
configuration then we look at 1440p
you'll notice the 290x is not present on
the 1440p benchmarks and this is because
of an issue with the witcher 3 it's a
weird bug where 1440p does not appear as
available for the gtx 980 single or for
the r9 290x just some of them I was able
to force the 980 to appear by building
an SLI configuration and disabling SLI
so it's not really a realistic approach
no one would actually do that but I was
able to sort of hack a 1440 availability
and the menus by doing that I could not
get 1440 to appear as an option for the
290x might be able to hack at through a
game configuration file but I haven't
tried yet but I do have a suspicion that
as possible as you see here a single gtx
980 doesn't do too poorly and the r9 285
is sort of just on the border of
playability depending on if you're a
medium or ultra and then dropping down
to 1080p this is where things get
interesting 1080p with ultra the 980 can
barely push 60 FPS average and that's
the average frame rate that's a very
expensive video card to play 1080p ultra
the game looks good I don't know that it
looks that good but that's really not
that's up for you to decide that's a
subjective thing but when we look past
the 980 the one percent low and point
one percent low FPS that are telling you
about our tanked by the graphic settings
you can see that some of these cards the
980 included are getting 14 17 FPS for
the loads and this means that you're
getting very noticeable as a user
jarring when you're playing the game so
you'll get a stutter every now and then
each of these tests is 30 seconds long
and I repeated them several times within
that 30 seconds I would notice the
stuttering at least once so that is
definitely a noticeable issue and this
is where the witcher 3 is poorly
optimized as I called it because in most
of the games we benchmark there's not
such a huge three or four X disparity
between the one percent lows and the
rest of the frame rates that 90 the rest
of the 99 percent of the frame rates the
290x enters playable range when we go
down to 1080p medium it's well within
playable range of 75 FPS unfortunately I
do not have a 280x or GTX 970 try to get
a 970 and trying to get a 280x but we
haven't been able to get one from AMD so
that is not on these charts the GTX 970
would be playable at 1080p medium
judging by our other performance of
video cards in the spectrum the gtx 960
is for example are in the 50 FPS range
and you'll see that there's not a huge
difference between two and four
gigabytes for these cards but if you're
curious how to vs. 4 gigabytes actually
impacts performance and other games on a
gtx 960 I do have a video for that on
the channel and finally here's the low
chart The Witcher 3 is really not that
well optimized you need very high-end
hardware to get a good frame rate we're
getting a lot of comments on the website
that are talking about how people are
getting a good average fps and they
don't know why we're calling it poorly
authorized the reason is you need to
measure the one percent lows and point
one percent lows to see where the
framerate actually does tank it's a
little less noticeable it is noticeable
and it does require certain scenes in
the game when the game starts going more
hectic
postprocessing effects like gloom and
aberration and you have a high amount of
polyester on the screen you're making
more draw calls because there's more
complex geometry on the screen this is
when the frame rate will really tank and
when you'll notice those dips a lot more
so it does take a certain type of
testing to to voc these failures so that
is all for Witcher 3 benchmark if you
like our journalistic approach to things
and my efforts to keep everything
objective and eliminate a lot of the
marketing heavy stuff on YouTube and on
some websites then please consider
looking into our patreon campaign this
is a new effort we're starting up to
help fund better equipment we're
building a video set so that's pretty
exciting to have a proper set buying
some studio lights so I don't have to
use these I strategically placed laughs
just out of shot and a blindingly bright
camera light so things are going pretty
well for the channel and that is because
we have great fans who have lately been
very vocal on the comments and you guys
are great at telling us the things that
you like so that i can make sure we keep
doing them and i appreciate that very
much so again check out the patreon
campaign please subscribe to the channel
