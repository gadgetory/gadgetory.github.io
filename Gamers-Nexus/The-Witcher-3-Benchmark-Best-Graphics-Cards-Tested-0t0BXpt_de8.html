nexus tonight and we have a huge amount
of video cards on the table right now
because i just got done doing a GPU
benchmark of The Witcher 3 and I worked
on this from about 7 p.m. on Monday
through 9:00 a.m. on launch day and the
reason it took so long is because we're
very careful with our methodology to
make sure that the results are accurate
and that the representative of real
world in-game use part of this includes
developing a custom in-game benchmark
where we look for various objects in the
game that reflect the game settings so
there's a lot of settings in game water
quality grass density things like that
chromatic aberration and I try to
include those different elements of
gameplay to ensure that it is actually
reflected in the benchmark we also do
multiple task passes to eliminate
outliers and then average the results
and further I collect data on average
FPS one percent level fps and 0.1% low
FPS the percentages are basically the
99th and 99.9% I'll frame rate results
within our 30 second testing period and
these represent dips and stuttering and
very jarring experiences to the user so
these are important numbers that can
show when the game will noticeably
stutter while you're playing it and it
creates sort of a hiccup in the
environment where it looks like the game
briefly hangs on to a frame a little bit
longer than it should so that's one of
the things we're collecting data on in
these results The Witcher 3 has a lot of
settings that aren't normally named in
games so there are some new settings
here and it's not quite as complex as
GTA 5's very deep settings but
definitely worth going over them briefly
and I'll have a full optimization guide
online after this for a brief overview
of the settings present a few of the
unknown ones are in the post-processing
effects tab and these would include
things like chromatic aberration which
is a photography term and it applies to
The Witcher 3 you can enable it or
disable it quite simply and chromatic
aberration is an effect that exists in
photography that is resultant of the
lens and how it interacts with the light
it's when the lens has difficulty
getting the color correct and focusing
on a certain color wavelength when
you're shooting a photo so in the game
this will be present mostly when looking
at light coming through windows or light
Maryna around objects due to various
types of backlighting and that creates a
sort of glow around the object and it
makes it look a little less in focus and
this is actually intentional it creates
a cinematic effect this isn't something
you would really see in the real world
it's not something you see without a
lens for the most part so it is
definitely more cinematic and less
realistic in that instance but you can
enable or disable it does not have a
huge frame rate impact from what I've
seen so far but I haven't finalized
those tests there are also things like
vignette even getting creates a soft
shadow around the center of whatever is
in focus so it creates a darkness around
the focused object and then you've got
depth of field which we've discussed
before DOF is another photographic term
it creates a level of depth and layering
to your shot where there's a bokeh
effect around the subject that's in
focus so if I'm in focus right now if we
had a lens with better depth of field on
this camera this wall would be more
blurred out these video cards might be
partially blurred out and then I would
be the most in focus so that gives you
an idea of what happens and this is
visible in the game as well and in gta5
Blum is another one this one has been
around for quite a while made a big
showing in Far Cry in the past and bloom
it creates a shimmering effect around
heat or light sources so in The Witcher
3 a good example would be fire if you
have an open flame and you have bloom
enabled you'll see a slight shimmering
over the fire and that's all that really
does it's just a filter and all the
post-processing effects are applied as a
filter atop the already rendered objects
models Poly's things like that and it
just sort of affects how you view the
game through the viewport so to speak of
the character in terms of performance
The Witcher 3 was actually fairly poorly
optimized as you'll see in these charts
and it ran not that great on SLI Dedes
on a Titan X all the way down the range
definitely does not run too well on AMD
right now note that for these tests we
had the newest Nvidia drivers and we
tried to use the beta AMD drivers which
are still ancient so to speak in terms
of drivers they go back to GTA 5 or
before that even so the latest AMD
drivers are not optimized for the
witcher 3 and
filming there are not new drivers that
are built for the witcher 3 so these
charts the numbers will change when AMD
does actually optimize their drivers for
the game to this end when trying to use
the 15.4 drivers the beta ones we found
that there were issues detecting some
cards there were other issues with
crashing and things like that I had to
roll back to the most recent stable
drivers which are very old I think
they're December and that's just because
AMD hasn't updated in quite a while I
likely do the new video cards coming out
soon and that will probably get the
biggest push but NVIDIA had game ready
drivers so you will see a performance
boost there some Nvidia users on the 700
series of last generation cards and
noted that they were able to eliminate
crashing by rolling back to the previous
GTA 5 drivers rather than using The
Witcher ones let's talk about the
benchmarks already so at 4k to sli gtx
980 s are barely able to run the game at
a playable fps there about 10 FPS below
where i would want them to be ideally
you sit at 60 and then a titan ax is a
little bit worse than those this is
known that the 1980s outperform a tight
next in most games when an SLI and
that's just because the 12 gigabytes of
video memory doesn't do as much for you
as the added processing power of an
additional video card dropping down the
medium settings gets a bit more playable
but it's still a little rough playing
the game at 4k with any graphics
configuration then we look at 1440p
you'll notice the 290x is not present on
the 1440p benchmarks and this is because
of an issue with the witcher 3 it's a
weird bug where 1440p does not appear as
available for the gtx 980 single or for
the r9 290x just some of them i was able
to force the 980 to appear by building
an SLI configuration and then disabling
sli so it's not really a realistic
approach no one would actually do that
but I was able to sort of hack a 1440
availability and the menus by doing that
I could not get 1440 to appear as an
option for the 290x might be able to
hack at 3 game configuration file but I
haven't tried yet but I do have a
suspicion that as possible as you see
here a single GTX 980 doesn't do too
poorly and the r9 285 is sort of just on
the border of playability depending on
if you're a medium or ultra and then
dropping down to 1080p this is where
thing
get interesting 1080p with ultra the 980
can barely push 60fps average and that's
the average frame rate that's a very
expensive video card to play 1080p ultra
the game looks good I don't know that it
looked that good but that's really not
that's up for you to decide that's a
subjective thing but when we look past
the 980 the 1% low and 0.1% low FPS that
are telling you about our tanked by the
graphics settings you can see that some
of these cards the 980 included are
getting 14 17 fps for the loads and this
means that you're getting very
noticeable as a user jarring when you're
playing the game so you'll get a stutter
every now and then each of these tests
is 30 seconds long and I repeated them
several times within that 30 seconds I
would notice the stuttering at least
once so that is definitely a noticeable
issue and this is where the witcher 3 is
poorly optimized as i called it because
in most of the games we benchmark
there's not such a huge 3 or 4x
disparity between the 1% lows and the
rest of the frame rates the 90 the rest
of the 99% of the frame rates the 290x
enters playable range when we go down to
1080p medium it's well within playable
range of 75 FPS unfortunately I do not
have a 280 X or GTX 970 trying to get a
970 and trying to get a 280 X but we
haven't been able to get one from AMD so
that is not on these charts the GTX 970
would be playable at 1080p medium
judging by our other performance of
video cards in this spectrum the GTX 960
is for example are in the 50 FPS range
and you'll see that there is not a huge
difference between 2 and 4 gigabytes for
these cards but if you're curious how
two versus 4 gigabytes actually impacts
performance in other games gtx 960 i do
have a video for that on the channel and
finally here's the low chart the witcher
3 is really not that well optimized you
need very high-end hardware to get a
good framerate we're getting a lot of
comments on the website that are talking
about how people are getting a good
average FPS and they don't know why
we're calling it poorly authorized the
reason is you need to measure the 1%
lows and point 1% lows to see where the
framerate actually does tank it's a
little less noticeable it is noticeable
and it does require certain scenes in
the game when the game starts going more
hectic with post-processing effect
like bloom and aberration and you have a
high amount of polyester on to the
screen you're making more draw calls
because there's more complex geometry on
the screen this is when the frame rate
will really tank and when you'll notice
those dips a lot more so it does take a
certain type of testing to to voke these
failures so that is all for our Witcher
3 benchmark if you like our journalistic
approach to things and my efforts to
keep everything objective and eliminate
a lot of the marketing heavy stuff on
YouTube and some websites then please
consider looking into our patreon
campaign this is a new effort we're
starting up to help fund better
equipment we're building a video set so
that's pretty exciting to have a proper
set buying some studio lights so I don't
have to use these I strategically placed
lamps just out of shot and a blindingly
bright camera light so things are going
pretty well for the channel and that is
because we have great fans who have
lately been very vocal on the comments
and you guys are great at telling us the
things that you like so that I can make
sure we keep doing them and I appreciate
that very much so again check out the
patreon campaign please subscribe to the
channel if you like this content check
the article for more and I will see you
all next time
