hybrid build for part 1 hit the link in
the description below as explained
previously we're doing this because I
want to and because I want to see if we
can smooth out those frequency spikes
with a liquid cooling solution because
we saw some improvement in that
department with MSI's Twin Frozr cooler
but not complete improvement in all
aspects of performance before getting to
part 2 of this content where we build it
into a liquid cooled product this
coverage is brought to you by MSI and
their new GTX 1060 gaming X which has
the aforementioned Twin Frozr 6 cooler
so here's what we got we're on our a
million of working with this card I am
dying I am sure Andrew the cameraman is
also dying but we're having some fun
with it so this as revealed in the
previous video is the base plate some of
the vrm cooling is right here helping
with the MOSFET heat dissipation which
they're covered so there's one that's
not covered right there these components
are part of the vrm you can see that
they've got thermal pads contacting to
the heatsink and so forth we explained
all this in the previous video and this
cable right here is the power header
that's sticking out this will be
interesting because I don't know I don't
know if I'm to be able to get this back
on there with the liquid cooling
solution installed so if I can't then
this will be super Frank and card build
because I will just be floating out in
the middle of the bench so here's what
we're gonna do I am trying to match this
EVGA cooler as explained previously it's
got a protrusion there I previously
called an extrusion some people with
with I guess shop experience correcting
me that is a protrusion of copper
sticking out of the cold plate and this
as explained previously helps with the
thermals because it's helping sink more
of that heat this actually goes in a bit
inside this thing is a bunch of micro
fins the liquid goes through the micro
fins and wicks away the heat that is
effectively collected via conduction by
the cold plate and that's our liquid
cooling solution goes through the
radiator so forth all that normal stuff
so I'm not I think we're gonna want to
mount this
this is kind of unwieldy we're gonna
want to mount that's probably the same
somewhat stupid way we did with the GTX
1080
we just have the pumps point out that
way and that's just because I think I'm
gonna be able to work with the frame a
bit better and I think this will fit but
I'm not 100% positive we'll find out
kind of live on on camera here my hope
is that I can keep this attached first I
need to reattach the vrm fan before
forgetting that or the I should call it
the blower fans it's not just cooling
the VRM okay there it goes all right
good enough
let's get that remounted I got to
remember how this went on originally I
don't really care how those stick out
right now okay all right so that is more
or less where it should be
these will kind of go in here once we're
done about I'm not concerned with that
right now
oops it looks like we can mount as
expected through there I clean this off
a little bit more we're using the
thermal paste pre applied to the cooler
here as we we tend to deal with liquid
cooling products but if a pioneer on
thermal paste you can be much more
generous with the GPU than with a CPU so
it's really not much of a concern where
do we want to start with this so if I
mount that now and I put this on after
will that work no this isn't really
entirely necessary it'll certainly help
a little with the cooling but got to add
the other parts and worry about that in
a moment
and then this could fit it no that's not
gonna work but maybe if we take off the
other thing I'm not gonna put that on
there I think I actually could I think I
could disconnect this and get it all
together but I don't know
but I really want to well either goes on
or doesn't but removing the silver part
of the shroud is not gonna hurt anything
either way and then putting it back
together later which isn't a problem so
let's just go ahead and take it apart
that was easy
that's kind of neat let's just go ahead
and reinstall this that's not gonna hurt
to do that's right
so that locks and I didn't notice this
before so I was a tiny groove in it and
the plate as so that this can sock it in
kind of see that that sockets into the
plate which makes it easier to hold in
place so that's nice okay so it goes
like this for sure I don't remember if
this was facing the other way or not
it's the last time if you watch the RX
480 and the 1080 hybrid build I actually
drew a diagram on a magnetic project mat
where the screws went this one I was a
lot more screwed so I just kind of used
this and threw it together okay
alright so we've got this they pretty
much rebuilt at this point and I believe
I decided that that has to go like that
I suck at the other that cold plate in
but I think I can screw in with some of
these first oh shoot I got to do the all
right
good enough that well look at that
picking up two at a time this is the
ideal time by the way to drop one of
these tiny screws down that the test
later two holes in the back come on man
oh close call
of course we're gonna have to see if the
liquid cooler will actually mount when
it's like this if not I'm gonna have to
take it all apart but I think I can save
some of these screws on the backside for
after figuring that out all right I
think that's good enough for us to
figure out that veins fit I could even
reattach this led if we wanted to but
you get a whole half a watt man that's
extra overclocking Headroom by getting
rid of it I need this to work
so we're gonna do like
forget that wasn't secured is this
trying to make contact with the GPU or
nice okay it's actually shocking that is
making direct contact that's perfect
yeah that looks okay well assuming that
this can actually go down it might be
too tall we kind of like sand off a
millimeter that's so stupid
see if you can see that copper plate in
there see it okay
okay some of these are lined up but not
all of them
maybe the baseplate will have to go
after all kind of figure out what's
happening to prevent contact on all four
holes simultaneously
it's obviously rocking on the copper
plate I think which as we can tell by
the thermal paste contact it looks like
yeah so it's definitely getting stuck on
that plate just gonna take that plate
off for now then that's fine I would
prefer to use it though
48 millimeters it seems like it should
work
hmm
yeah it's just not gonna clear it there
shouldn't be any metal shavings but if
there were they're gone now check this
thing out again I think we have to take
this out again get that out you can't
always get what you want
it's definitely hitting that you know
that level of tired you got where your
entire body hurts okay so it's taken
back apart what is causing the clearance
issue is it simply the whole distance or
hi there's the product there is your
problem
quoting Adam Savage of Mythbusters the
holes are fine so the issue is it looks
like we could kind of just send just a
little bit it's actually leaving a mark
on the inside wall so it's right there
Oh kinda tempted to hit with a hammer so
do you want to file it or okay don't put
that over there you're gonna have to
deal with the cringe I apologize
that might have actually worked dan and
that will make contact we need to take
some off the other side too I think well
that's a pleasant sound yeah alright you
ready
that's a fight through it I apologize
it's almost clearing it
it's just that bottom bit of clearance
because it tapers out to be larger at
the bottom that's pretty good though
that's not quite try the other side
maybe won't scream as much that's pretty
damn good
more has to come off on this side I
think they did this just to stop me oh I
think that's basically it
yep that's in there okay all right so
first of all don't do this haha not
don't do this at home just don't do this
this is bad practice for a million
reasons I probably should have said or
grinded this outside but it's dark out
and frankly we already have the camera
the light setup so it was done here
secondly metal shavings are everywhere
that is a concern the PCB the card are
far enough where I'm hoping it's a
non-issue for them what we're gonna do
is don't show them that man that's way
too clear we're gonna blast this with
air I will probably soak it in something
just to be sure
take the vrm fan off or whatever def
again a blast it with with compressed
air for the base plate this is very well
set in there now the cooler we're not
going to use this one we're going to use
the same model I'm gonna use a different
cooler for two reasons one the thermal
paste is a little left but - because I
got you know decided to start testing
this while I was working on it without
cleaning in between I am positive
there are metal shavings on that thermal
paste I could clean it off I'm gonna
play it safe we will use a different MOT
we'll use the same model different
cooler different unit and that should
resolve that issue I wanted to take one
apart anyway so we'll just take this one
apart in the future this will be our
model that we dismantle so I think this
will work but we'll show you in this
video so what we're going to do is break
for tonight I'll clean it off and then
we'll finish putting it together
tomorrow this will all be in one video
so you'll see the whole finished product
shortly after this
okay so one very long night later we
managed to get this to where it just
barely fits the cold plate I didn't have
to take off too much of the metal we
have some b-roll showing the the
progress to finish that took this
outside and use anti-static compressed
air to blow it off and then used tape
before and after and then before again
anti-static air to get any metal
shavings off really worked hard at the
metal shavings because that is the one
thing that could actually ruin this
whole project which if it does whatever
but hopefully it does not ruin the card
so I think we're good I'm not gonna use
the the cooler I had picked out
yesterday but I do have a clone of it so
we're gonna try this again might take
some force to get this thing socketed
foley because it is pretty snug but it
does it does fit now so we're good to go
this project is one of the longest ones
we've done for hybrid coolers so far but
I got to remember how all this goes back
together - it's been a full night so
first of all definitely an eye connect
this here we're actually to the pump
let's do that first
it's gonna go it's right there and this
will go down here
all right unless this one just needs to
be worn down like the other one was on
the sides I think it'll work this one's
slightly different size than the other
one
to figure out a longer screw or
something okay so it can work I think
that one actually went head
cross-threaded yep trust
I need a different screw oh yeah yeah
different screw I have the best race
that can't be right it says use the
previously used screws so do they change
their are you having that hybrid box
here's some these are much different oh
man that may have been a lot of our
problem right there oh that's working
wait to see if it actually works before
I address the camera with what we've
just discovered huh I think it's gonna
work definitely a tight fit but is it
making contact yes I think so
and we'll find out in testing if it's
not that's the best I could do because
the screw holes are not exactly the same
as what we've worked with previously
it's just slightly off which is causing
that kind of angled install I'm gonna
reassemble the rest of this thing gotta
plug this in for the BRM fan and the
pump which will both be powered by the
board all right so that's connected this
will go on here
I could route that under it but whatever
how's that cable okay is it gonna fit I
think I think it'll actually kind of
work no that's wrong what's that there
originally it looks like the bottom of a
screw that's crews got a lot of get a
lot of stress on it right now
something's I think it's the cables no
it's the it's the pump his pump caps can
come off
when his block it's definite
there we go and it spins what do you
think likes one guys comment some dudes
like you're so patient like a true
craftsman it's like oh man I feel very
bad for like whoever said that guys
impression of what a craftsman is this
ain't it do something six times like I'm
doing right now to see if something will
work I don't think is what a craftsman I
do sound like Bob Stewart OBS mods
that's the craftsman doesn't seem right
okay so there's only one screw that
wasn't used and I know exactly where it
goes I'm not concerned about it cuz it
was for a cosmetic piece that was being
secured from four other bolts through
the top all right that is it that's the
1060 hybrid who would have thought this
would have been the most difficult one
first of all EVGA you're welcome for the
free advertising I don't know if it was
worth my pain but we decided to leave
the the pump plate on there took the
thin the faceplate of the shroud of the
GPU on and off like four times we took
it off originally looked kind of cool
for clearance reasons we did take it off
but then put it back on let's just
pretend that that socket incorrectly I
don't want to take out four more bolts
right now so we'll just pretend that
everything's perfect so that is the gtx
1060 Hybrid I think it probably still
works the last two have still worked
after we've done these the difference
here is we filed the crap out of the
base plate to make it fit so the past
two mods as many of you have pointed out
we did not elect to use the base plate
that came with the card either because
we were using something else like one of
these kits
has its own cooling solution or whatever
but in this case I did decide to use it
it was effort I think the pump is making
contact the cold plates making contact
with the GPU itself I'm pretty sure
that's happening we'll know instantly it
does look like it though after making
those changes and then what else did we
change that's really them that's the
main part of it so the only concern is
if there's a metal shaving left
somewhere that happens to bridge
something to make contact but I did
actually legitimately spend a good
amount of time cleaning this with tape
and compressed air so I hope we got all
those everything's plugged in all that's
left I guess we'll just do this right
now is to connect these two be pieces
for the radiator fan if I want to later
I can plug that into the board to get an
extra couple of watts but that's really
that's it that's it we're done so that's
the 10 60 hybrid subscribe so you can
see the final part where we'll have the
numbers performance metrics and all that
assuming it still works or the part
where I throw it in the garbage but
thank you for watching page online the
post roll video if you want to help fund
more videos like this because they take
a lot of time and are surprisingly
expensive to do I'll see you all next
time
