Nexus dotnet and today we're reviewing
some speakers these are the GX gaming SW
- G 2.1 2045 watt speaker system
speakers and that's that's sort of the
name there's a lot more words but that's
the gist of it and these are made by
genius which is a an Asian company that
is beginning to venture into the US
market with gaming it did so with the
Gila mouse and with the death whatever
death taker Mouse and we reviewed both
of those when they shipped probably
about two years ago now but this is
their speaker setup and the speakers are
pretty straightforward it's - satellite
speakers and a subwoofer and then it
also includes a sound mixer so that's
four total components and it's got all
the cables that you need of course the
the hard specs are this the satellite
speakers use 3-inch high excursion
metallic drivers so that's fairly
standard drivers for a budget class
budget class speaker setup like this one
three inches though is about 76
millimeters and your average headset
drivers may be about forty millimeters
so it's a little bit bigger than a
headset driver almost twice as big the
subwoofer uses a 6.5 inch pressure
driver and that's pretty darn big it's
not maybe the 8 inch drivers you'll find
in some cars but for a cheap 96 dollar
gaming PC setup it's pretty good so
that's just the driver size the
frequency response is fairly average
nothing to call home about it's 25 Hertz
to 20 kilohertz again pretty average
there the output power is measured at 45
watts total RMS standard measurement and
the subwoofer is 29 watts each satellite
speakers eight watts ish so that's sort
of the the power output the drivers and
the frequency response there are four
total components as mentioned and it
retails at 96 dollars this makes it a
budget-friendly
speaker system and the mixer makes it
appealing to HTPC audiences now let's
put my reviewer stance into perspective
because audio is more subjective I
personally use a set of the the Corsair
speakers that are $230 the pretty
high-end
PC speakers and they're very good
quality for music and for gaming the GX
gaming speakers are a bit more tuned for
the gaming side of things they're not
really advertised as music speakers but
obviously they will play music just fine
just it will be a bit more tinny in my
experience so in testing the genius
speakers they had a bit of a 10 on
hi-hat heavy songs or on songs that had
harsher vocals so not perfect but pretty
good for $100 I would call it above
average for the audio quality with
regard to music with regard to gaming
the base is very boomy it sounds great
with explosions in games like
Battlefield and in more cinematic games
like Skyrim where you will probably be
playing that type of game in a living
room environment and the reason I
mentioned that is because I think these
speakers are sort of the ultimate option
for a semi complex home theater PC setup
if you don't want any other mixers or if
you don't want preamps and amps and all
that stuff if you kind of just want one
solution to plug into the PC and go this
is a good place to start the mixer will
accept three total inputs plus a line in
and it's got a 3.5 out as well so you
can actually set this up as a PC and one
of the spots they call it a turntable or
record player and another one you can
plug in your mp3 player into the line-in
and then use a source button to toggle
the mode to jump between each of these
devices and it is highlighted with an
LED so it's very user friendly now you
won't get as full of a sound with this
type of speaker in a living room
environment because these are really
meant to be about 18 inches away from
your ears and more of a desktop PC
environment but the mixer does make it
very tempting to put in a multi-use
setup especially if you've got two
computers or something like that audio
quality on the whole is fairly good I
would say that if you've got two times
the money the Corsair speakers that I
that I use are really pretty amazing
they're two point one setup as well if
you don't want all the mess of a five
point one set up it is called the SP
2500 and the Corsair ones do ship with
an equaliser so that you can actually
mix the audio
little bit more accurately depending on
what you're doing if you're just looking
for something affordable that can be
used to a versatile end in a complex
environment at about a hundred bucks I
would suggest the GX gaming two thousand
speakers that were reviewing here they
they really are very easy to set up and
use sound quality is decent I have
complaints about the tendinous in some
music in the games the bass is fine and
music the bass sometimes feels a little
bit muddy and kind of washed out but in
games it sounds just fine for your
average explosions and dragons and
things like that so that is the genius
2000 2.1 speakers you can check the link
in the description below for the full
review and an article if you want to
read more of my thoughts and I will see
you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
