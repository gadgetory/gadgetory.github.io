exclusivity with Titan V's we want to
try and set some records on hardware bot
that's gonna be done by liquid cooling
at least one of them so we have two of
these I bought this one a few days ago
we've been working on it for review
hours clocks pretty high already
but we need to liquid cool it to get rid
of that thermal limit and reduce power
leakage which will give us more power to
use for the core we are also going to be
using this one from channel bit speed
tripping who loaned this to us very
generously and we're gonna put them in a
multi GPU set up and see what we can do
with things like GPU pi so this video
will be dedicated to liquid cooling our
torn down card we went through a lot of
different options for this and it took
us a while to find a good one but I
think we did so we're gonna show you
that whole process today but before we
get into that this coverage is brought
to you by ifixit.com and their pro Tech
tool kit I fix it as refreshing their
Pro Tech tool kit in time for the
holidays you can find a link in the
description below to the Pro Tech tool
kit and other tool kits that I fix it
sells we find the Pro Tech and
essentials kits to be the most useful
for DIY enthusiasts okay so I'm going to
show you all the stuff we did including
going through what we did for Vega with
some contact paper to make sure what we
were doing actually made contact with
the GPU and the HBM the big concern with
liquid cooling this type of device is
that the HBM which you can see as these
smaller modules flanking the GPU is very
fragile the whole all the silicon is
very fragile but the HBM especially it's
smaller it's out of the parameter so if
you have any kind of like torsional or
unequal uneven force on the opposing
corners you could definitely crack the
dies and we don't want to do that
because I actually paid for this myself
and it was $3,000 another option we had
was doing just you could always do just
a better air cooler but I really want to
do liquid because Pascal and Volta
behaved the same with their clocks which
is basically the cooler it is the higher
the clock if we can get this below 60 C
and I'm confident that we can we can
increase the clock significantly if we
got it below 50 C we can get it even
further which we might be
with the help of ambient temperature
outside if it's benchmarked outside or
something when it's zero see that I
would definitely get us there so let me
show you what we looked at a couple of
the options here and I'll just once
again plug our gamers necks as mod Matt
would just slowly accumulate their whole
paste this is available on store that
gamers nexus dotnet slash mod Matt if
you want to check it out it's grounded
so I'm plugged into a strap which is
plugged into the mat corner so that
grounds the mat and then that plugs into
a common ground point in the wall so we
are pretty safe right now from damaging
this card and when it costs as much it
pays to be paranoid so options that we
looked at previously for Vega we used an
ASA Tech Intel plate like this and then
drilled some holes in it and the problem
is Vega is 64 by 64 for the mounting
hole distance the spacing for these
mounting holes so Vega 64 by 64 this one
is about 70 by 70 so if you can see on
the calipers there we're 70 by 70 for
this it is square and that's problem
that means we can't use our Vega plate
which sucks because it took a whole lot
of work to make next thing I remember
these these are from I think deep cool
to adapt one of their coolers to rise
and almost line up with the mounting
holes above it like one would line up
but not the other looked at other plates
we've got stuff like this that's just
entirely too big in any direction and
the holes don't line up with anything
that's a thread river plate so then I
remember this this is a be quiet silent
loop 280 that they sent us for review
previously it wasn't the best performing
on our bench but it was good enough and
the more important thing than the
performance was the mounting plate so
these plates I think it's maybe it's
aqua computer that makes these alpha
cool maybe I don't know Alva cool uses
the same kit either way so we can use
theirs as well but these kits
just separate and you can see if you can
see that that was hole they're starting
to line up I'm gonna have a hard time
lining up for camera but they are more
or less there we might come in at a
slightly off angle it might not be
perfectly ninety degrees
long-term I wouldn't like that but if we
can get something working I'd be ok with
it so that kind of lines up and then
this one looks like it lines up almost
perfectly to the point where I was like
okay so maybe we mount this to the back
of the card run the screw through it
that way put the nut on this side with a
washer and then we be done and you just
tape off all the capacitors and
components that you might potentially
short with these brackets well better
option came up and that is to just
straight use to be quiet cooler and we
take this then we'll just mount it right
there so now you're all caught up to
where we are we haven't actually tested
this yet it hasn't been turned on or
anything hasn't even been fully
assembled so we were just figuring out
what to even do and now it's time to do
those things test it and we're gonna
start by I think I've pretty much
figured out the mounting pressure I want
but I'm not positive yet so I think I
want the screws to come through the back
side of the card I want eleven point
five millimeters of threads exposed so
there's our eleven point five so we're
gonna use that for the I want to use
this gauge down here the screw bottom
will come up to that point and basically
it'll be coming through like this and
then we'll stop once right eleven point
five this paper it uses two sheets and
they chemically react to each other to
create the patterns you're seeing these
are all different Vega cards and you can
actually see on some of them like this
one you can see the HBM right there
and the core as opposed to one that has
an epoxy resin coating like this or this
where it's just the HBM and the core
kind of homogeneous and NVIDIA uses that
epoxy resin coating so we're looking for
the same reaction if we do too much
pressure you crack the dye or the HBM
and you kill a $3,000 card unless you
get exceptionally lucky and only crack
the dead HBM
or disable hbm die okay so we need a
sheet of this I think about that size
good be enough that'll be a little bit
more than enough so what we're gonna do
I'm gonna try and slide this in between
the plate and the GPU after we start
getting it mounted now I can use thermal
paste right now
I think we want the tubes oriented at
the top be easier to work with so we're
gonna mount like this and now you might
be asking why don't you leave the base
plate on there to cool the prm's first
of all they don't really need it we can
just put a fan on there and it will cool
just as well if not better secondly I
don't want this plate on here because if
this plate is on here I have no access
to the components what I want to do is
later on I want to be able to short the
shunts so that's a shunt right there
that five million I see
that's a shunt and we have another one
down here that's a Shawn this one we
think goes to the PCIe you can actually
see the traces running down here so we
probably don't need to play with that
one but if we use liquid metal we can
short these two and bypass some of the
the power or voltage restrictions and
I'm going to talk to builds worried
about how to do this properly and what
kind of results we should expect but
we're going to do that last after just
straight liquid cool in it
so we removing thermal limits first then
we'll remove some of the power elements
by shorting those putting the base plate
on would make it impossible for me to
access those without completely
disassembling all the work we're about
to do
and again these VRMs are plenty strong
without the baseplate so we're actually
going to remove the pads and not even
cool them and then later now that we've
done all the thermals for this card
already I'll just replace the pads with
better ones probably like the thermal
grizzly minus eight or whatever they're
called pads so we're gonna exploit these
as much as we can and push the screw all
the way to the inside again it's very
easy to cause damage in this process we
would advise that you don't do it and I
would also advise that we don't do it
but we make stuff for video so if it
goes horribly wrong we still get contact
and it's kind of been practiced at this
point anyway
done this with a lot of cards now got
these on the next step is gonna be
figuring out how much tighten them so I
need to loosen these enough to get that
contact paper in there this has two
sides one's rough and one is shiny we
want rough to contact rough to trigger
the reaction we want white on top of
clear just like this there will be a bit
of a reaction where I'm handling it at
the corners but
right so we have that in there now it's
time to start tightening these there's
no time limit on it or anything I'm
going to start by getting the corners I
posed in to be tight enough that the
paper is not going to move that way I
can start handling the card vertically I
know we want to be at least 11.5 that's
pretty much pretty close okay so that's
what it's going to look like when we're
done now we just need to figure out if
we got it tight enough unfortunately
that means unscrewing everything I'm
doing all that work which wasn't that
much but okay we need to go tighter on
that I think so not great contact most
the contact was at the top which there's
last couple turns I was going all on the
bottom which means we were kind of
imbalance anyway now I'm gonna reuse
this paper you should use new stuff but
as long as we see all red at the end
then that's all I'm really going for
today let's try this again and we'll go
to 11.75 this time
I think it's perfect but I'm starting to
get uneasy from how much force is being
applied so we're gonna see if it looks
okay it does not need to be a hundred
percent red it just needs to be enough
that thermal paste will cover the gaps
that's getting actually pretty damn good
so if I actually tighten it properly to
11.8 I was kind of loose on the bottom
we were at like eleven point seven so if
we go to eleven point eight on the
bottom then we'll be good because you
can see this outer edge was already hit
once in the last attempt and it's pretty
much the same pattern as before you can
see one was slightly lower than the
other so that's good
now we're covering more in the middle
covering a bit in the bottom thermal
paste will help out with the rest it's
still a bit of a gap but if we just make
sure they're all eleven point eight I
think we'll be in business so we can
take that information and prepare for
thermal paste and then just make sure
they're all tightened I will make a note
to not bias towards the top next time as
well we have options here I was
considering this is her care package
from thermal grizzly I was considering
conduct a not liquid metal but it is the
problem with with conduct or not is it's
electrically conductive and I like
conductor not a lot and it would be fine
to use if I I'd basically have to use
electrical tape around these kind all
these little ICS so like the resistors
and the capacitors makes her nothing
shorts and it wouldn't be that bad but
we are taking on enough risk as is that
I don't need to compound that with with
an electrically conductive chemical it
would improve performance but this stuff
which which one is this this is cryo not
cryo not coming in and knock us black
tube just kind of
you know it's a honey even it's still
12.5 watts per meter Kelvin so I don't
really think we need to go with liquid
metal it would get us a bit but it's
just it's really not worth the risk
right now Dan this is just like spilling
out so for this one the approach we're
taking is manual spread so I'm just
gonna cover the whole thing
not even to clean the excess because
it's just not relevant okay so any
excess will squish out and then stuff
that's contacting the sides of the
mountain or the the package assembly
will conduct into this cold plate so we
can pick up some extra temperature there
because the the cold plate is larger
than the silicon
so here's what we're gonna do now I'm
gonna get the throne paste off my face
and my hands and this thing's pretty
much ready to go so what I need to do is
thermal test just a really quick one
just plug the plug the card in turn the
computer on check the temperature idle
if the temperature aisle starts climbing
towards 90 then we shut it down
and tighten the screws a bit more to
improve the contact if the temperature
looks fine I'll put it under like a 30
second load and if it climbs towards 90
we'll shut it down and tighten
everything if it doesn't then we're good
to go now we don't have HBM sensors but
there's a good chance if the GPU is fine
the HBM is fine especially with I mean I
can physically see down there and I can
see the dye is contacting the cold plate
so I think we're good I'm actually
pretty happy with this one this is a 280
liquid cooler on here so it's very
pretty powerful cooler as far as video
card cooling goes I almost forgot this
is a Titan V that we're working on so it
is doing 250 plus watts we're gonna try
and push it towards 300 and the cooler
should be sufficient I'll probably
replace the fans with maglevs or
something like that but yeah I need to
do some cleanup and test in and I think
we're good to go if you liked this
coverage and you like the Matt I was
using I actually I really I'm very
pleased with how it came out you can
pre-order it that's stored on cameras
