card underwater taught us a lot about
the cards Headroom for overclocking its
severe power limitations and how solving
for power leakage can improve
performance in non-trivial ways with
this architecture in many ways it's a
callback to the pure e^x especially when
we look at the liquid cooling aspect of
it we have better tools to test video
cards now than we did back then today
we're looking at the results for our
Vega frontier Edition a hybrid mod which
mounted a liquid cooler to the card and
then used via RAM heat sinks separately
for cooling the FETs
before getting to that this is brought
to you by our patreon backers you can go
to patreon.com/scishow and join the
patreon backers and if you join there
you can join us on discord where we have
a patreon back or chat with GN staff or
if you prefer store gamers nexus net has
our shirts available for purchase if you
watched our Vega frontier edition hybrid
model blog it was not the most
straightforward hybrid mod that we've
ever done we had to take an intel
bracket CPU bracket and drill some extra
holes in it so that allowed us to get
the 64 by 64 spacing on Vega I believe
the fury X also has that spacing that we
ended up doing this instead because the
fury X has other issues like choke
clearance and then you have to start
separating parts of the cooler that you
really don't want to start pulling apart
so instead we did this we took the
liquid cooler we already had weren't
using drilled some holes in the bracket
and mounted it to the card and we've got
b-roll of all that and it worked out
pretty well for the vrm cooling we had
to get rid of the plate so that did not
keep the base plate on there instead we
replaced it with just some thinned heat
sinks and honestly these aren't even
necessary the MOSFETs on this card it's
a 6 by 2 so it's a 12 phase fix doubled
basically and it's exposed copper anyway
so if you just point a good fan of it
you'll be fine and we sort of did that
anyway but that's what the solution was
and a few reasons for that one we didn't
want to drill into the base plate and
start making modifications in a way that
we couldn't return this card to this
condition because ultimately when it is
tested in the future for regression
testing we want it in its original state
to represent the
card as it's sold and also just it works
fine this way so why not in fact it
worked quite well so we're going to go
over all the thermals and noise today
one big thing here to keep in mind with
these hybrid mods the goal isn't just to
get more performance in terms of frame
rate or frequency or points and
synthetic benchmarks the point is to see
one is there some kind of limitation and
thermals and if there's not that's fine
because the next thing you look at is
what's the noise improvement what are
the acoustic differences with liquid
versus there when you can run this thing
really if you wanted to at 70 decibels
at 20 inches away at 100% fan speed or
you run something like this at 43 and
see that this will perform better so
that's a big part of it and keep that in
mind that it is about acoustics as well
and then of course the bigger picture
here is that we do this to learn about
the card and one of the things we
learned about Vega Frontier Edition is
that power leakage actually impacts your
overclocking the Headroom quite
significantly this was the same with the
fury X so the fury X when it launched
there was a lot of discussion by review
sites ours included about why do you do
a closed loop on your video card part of
that answer was you at lower power
leakage on HBM and on the GPU itself and
that gives you either just lower power
consumption overall at the same clock
speeds and voltages or more Headroom to
boost the clock and voltages and so
that's what we see again here it's at
this time this particular model is
air-cooled although they do have a
liquid-cooled variants as well it will
be sold in smaller quantities so we're
focusing on the air-cooled variants with
our own mod instead let's get the
overclocking numbers on the screen first
since these will be shown in the rest of
the test the Vega
Frontier Edition hybrid model actually
posted reasonable gains an overclocking
over-the-air cold variant this is due to
more aggressive clock scaling the versus
the power consumption similar to what's
seen on some other architectures we were
able to max out our stock card
air-cooled at around 16 60 megahertz
overclock with an 1,100 megahertz HBM to
overclock this we ultimately found
governs performance more heavily than
the core by the way a hybrid card with
the
help of some fans point of um components
that they were unnecessary I was able to
overclock to 1705 megahertz completely
stable no issues at all with an 11:05
megahertz 8 p.m. to OC this sustained
through all the fire strike tests all
the gaming tests and spec view per we
end up running our published numbers
that you'll see in this video at 1700
megahertz core and eleven hundred
megahertz
memory and we'll be revisiting with
higher clocks later because we think
there's some room to go a bit beyond
1705 and 11:05 anyway with some better
tuning as for power consumption our
overclocked Vega Fe hybrid mod had us
around thirty three point three amps max
during our tests at the rails
not counting the PCIe interface power
and that's for GPU power consumption not
total system power so GPU power
consumption at the PCIe rails from the
power supply reads out at four hundred
Watts
thirty three point three amps is about
four hundred Watts twelve volt power
that's GPU power again not a total
system power this is the power
limitation for Vega and is the reason we
can't OC higher even though we have
plenty of thermal Headroom to do so and
is something we'll look at more in the
future hopefully to unlock a higher TDP
either way the most notable element here
is what's not shown in temperature plots
noise output the hybrid mod outputs a
constant noise level of 43 DBA because
we're maxing the radiator fan and that's
what the radiator fan only the Maglev
fans boost that noise level a little bit
but we're still below what the stock
card does when you're in the overclock
settings in order to sustain its lower
overclock the 16 60 megahertz one the
air-cooled stock card was whining at
about 67 DBA output the perceived at
noise level difference here as
significant we're at more than a two
times perceived reduction with the
hybrid mod given that this is a
logarithmic scale that is it's more than
2x it's not a linear scale and this next
test is new it's also pretty cool we're
looking at power leakage here using a
current clamp to measure power
consumption at the 12 volt rails from
the power supply we're not measuring
PCIe slot power yet which can push up to
75 Watts under the spec but maybe in the
future this touch requires the card to
operate at a fixed reliable speed
without any fluctuations as observed in
the stock air Gold Card which never
really attained or held at 1600
megahertz anyway
as such we're running the core clock at
1,300 megahertz for both the liquid
cooled and air cooled variants since
that can be sustained without change and
a memory clock of a thousand megahertz
which seems to help stability as well
the power offset is at plus 50% just to
further ensure there are no fluctuations
the result is on the screen now with the
air cooled card we start encountering
power throttling that had us bouncing
between 18 and 25 amps once the GPU hit
85 C and so we are forced to increase
the fan rpm manually from its Auto
configuration this fluctuation by the
way is indicative of small throttling
occurring at a level that doesn't always
show up in clock measuring software
there is performance loss from the high
thermals but it doesn't necessarily show
up increasing the fan rpm to a 51 DBA
and sustaining about 80 to 83 Salty's on
the core we see that the power
consumption is now around 26 amps
sustained from the power supply after
some burnin time whereas the hybrid
card's power consumption even after
burnin time and with temperatures of
around 42 BC sits closer to 23.4 amps
for the power mark this is also largely
unchanging from start to test and while
the air-cooled card scales from about 22
to 26 ABS over the period of the test
this is a 2.6 amp overhead from the
hybrid mod resulting in a power leakage
of about 31 watts due to heat so
measuring with this we're drawing 31
watts more with the air-cooled card
versus the liquid cooled card with the
fan keeping vanes at around 81 to 82
Celsius when we were hitting 85 C it was
starting to throttle enough in the power
consumption metric that adjust it was a
much harder task to actually be
comparable but if you manually increase
the fan outside of its auto settings to
push a bit harder we're seeing a power
loss basically through leakage of 30
watts and that's where the additional
Headroom comes from when we got the
liquid cooled variants of this card
about 40 mega Hertz higher on the core
so that's the answer of where your
Headroom emerges and it's in the extra
power now the extra thermal is
necessarily the
certainly helped by way of reducing
power leakage one more note here's a
look at the temperatures under this
particular workload that we use for
power leakage measurement our hybrid mod
is able to keep the MOSFETs around or
below 50 C for this entire test the
stock card is hitting the upper 80s and
90s in this load especially again with
the plus 50% power offset with a fan
configuration we use now these numbers
are not comparable to the initial review
tests because they use a completely
different method and a different
software benchmark and even some
different positioning for the measuring
tools but overall we're within spec it's
certainly just contributing to power
leakage and boosted temperature of the
GPU core given that they ultimately
share the same cooling solution and are
all neighbors this verifies some of what
we already knew or at least what we
thought we knew and that is that Vega
frontier Edition is bumping against
power more than anything else for
limitations so the power limit appears
to be about 400 watts to the PCIe cables
connected to the card you've got some
additional power that comes in through
the PCIe slot on the motherboard which
we can't currently measure but we are
looking into it and that's the limiter
now as we get around that you would need
a BIOS update or BIOS flashing tool and
a hex editor which is something we're
looking into and trying to figure out we
may end up using something like a
Raspberry Pi to flash the BIOS because
no flashing tools currently exist ATI
flash doesn't work on Vega right now
it's something we're looking into no
promises on if it'll work which means we
wouldn't deliver content on it but if it
does we'll certainly be back and try and
boost TDP to something like 500 watts
and see what does an extra hundred watts
get you out of the clock assuming that
the card can survive at that point which
should be feasible if you look at builds
BRM analysis on our Channel the vrm can
take it it's just a matter of can we get
it to happen so that's the next step we
are power-limited more than anything
else but the thermal limitations sort of
existed in that you had a an indirect
conflict for boosting clocks and that
was because of the power leakage because
of thermals just to illustrate the clock
rate stability with these our clocks
quickly here's a look at frequency
versus time and our testbench as at red
just through an automated series of
3dmark benchmarks getting from ultra to
extreme than normal and followed up with
times by both clocks are fairly stable
in this particular run but that's
because we've boosted the
speed on the air-cooled card - Brent
throttling we can also plot the stock
air-cooled card with no overclock and
auto fan speeds and that's this next
line that's being drawn on the screen
now moving on to power versus thermals
in a stack view prayer workload which
cycles load as the test executes and
simulates production and tests we see
the overclocked
hybrid configuration drawing about 600
watts from the wall again from the wall
we're back to wall draw test and not the
current clamps testing so 600 watts
during the heaviest load of this cycle
to compare versus the stock cars this is
an increase from around 440 watts loaded
from the wall originally and that's just
measured that way because we started
running those tests before we got the
current clamp despite the increased
power draw of the hybrid overclock we're
actually way down in thermals from the
air-cooled card the liquid cooler also
soaked thermal changes and high thermal
load spikes with greater finesse
ultimately topping out around 47 Celsius
or the stock card was hitting 81 C
pretty close to its limiting 84 to 85 C
throttle range finally here's a quick
study state thermal chart to show the
temperature performance of various board
components when the card is put through
a power virus scenario we see
significant improvement not only on the
GPU temperature but the two hot spots on
the vrm even without additional fans
providing direct airflow the vrm
components are hybrid mod is well within
any component heat specification most of
which are well above 100 C above 125 C
even and we're only showing Vega on this
chart right now for comparative thermals
and noise normalized thermals check our
initial Vega frontier Edition review
which also contains a Titan XP and other
cards getting into benchmark numbers now
this chart shows the specular
performance improvements in various
workloads with our stock hybrid and
overclocked hybrid mods 3ds max posts
the performance improvement of about 6
percent when overclocked of the hybrid
mod with equal performance for the stock
air and hybrid Vega F II cards kadia
posts an 11 percent performance gain
from the overclocked and liquid with
creo at a 5 percent gain followed by the
energy test at a 15 percent gain and
then the Maya test with a 6.8 percent
gain going through these pretty quickly
the medical benchmark is responsive to
the overclocked actually decently
responsive posting nearly a 19% improved
with the ocm liquid with the next past
showcase at a 13% improvement SN x o2 at
9.5 percent improvement and s w o3 at an
8 percent gain from the overclock only a
few of those were particularly exciting
the rest don't really feel like they
were worth the effort kind of a lot of
effort for no big gains and some of
those tests but the medical one as a
standout example does look better for
the 100 megahertz boost on the core and
sets the stage for a next round of tests
which are something gaming workloads and
a few things to note here
this card is clearly not really gaming
ready at launch it does have a gaming
mode driver it is supposed to be able by
am these own definition to sit between
the gaming and the professional
audiences something like we said in our
initial review might be occupied by a
game developer despite this not being
fully ready through drivers or enabled
or disabled features we're still testing
it for gaming and this still provides a
good look at clock scaling even with the
driver limitations or shortcomings and
even with some of the features
potentially disabled so we still get a
look at the clock performance uplift
which is an important metric nonetheless
and just another note like we've been
making in all these videos we're not
talking RX Vega performance yet and
suggest that you refrain from attempting
to speculate or extract numbers from
these on how Rx Vega will perform just
wait for our review to see how that does
starting with fire strike with a pen ATP
test our graphics core on the hybrid
modded an overclocked score of twenty
four thousand nine hundred ninety eight
points versus the twenty one three five
five score of the stock air-cooled card
that's a gain of 17 percent with the
overclocked hybrid with the overclocked
air card we were at twenty four five
five four or a gain of 15 percent over
the stock card the boost strictly from
our extra 40 megahertz on liquid isn't
tremendous over-the-air boost only a
couple of percent but again this is
about thermal and noise performance more
than anything and the noise is way down
with the hybrid mod firestrike ultra has
our overclocked versus stock air gain at
around seventeen point seven percent so
that's the 4k benchmark once again
providing some consistency between 4k
and 10
dp4 the other fire strike in times five
test check the article linked below
we're going to only show a few games
next not too many and all the rest of
the benchmarks can be found in that
article linked below started with doom
at 4k with Vulcan and asynchronous
compute and yes disabling anti-aliasing
does still enable asynchronous compute
as this was changed with more recent
patches to the game we see the
overclocked vega card operating an
average FPS of 80 with lows at 66 and 60
is a staggering performance gain of 25%
in doom specifically with the overclock
and the liquid cooling and as the title
in which we saw the biggest Swain note
that doom and Sniper Elite both tend to
favor Andy so this is something of a
best-case scenario for the overclocking
result you cannot and should not
extrapolate this 25% number to all the
games as well show more momentarily
regardless that's an impressive boost
and not to take away from it the Vega
EFI card on liquid and with our
significant overclock is now performing
in between a gtx 980 reference card and
a gtx 980ti reference card sitting about
11% behind the 1080 TI f e or if you
want to look at an overclocked model
from an AIB partner 19% behind the 1080
TI gaming X model now big note here this
chart doesn't contain overclock numbers
for the 1080 simply because it's not
really the focus right now and where you
haven't rerun them on this suite yet
which is a brand new test suite so you'd
see some performance up with there
regardless Vega FPS gains are noteworthy
in Doom we're next moving on to Ghost
Recon wildlands with DirectX 11 very
high settings and 4k resolution in this
title the hybrid overclocked
configuration outperforms the stock air
configuration by 17.5% certainly not as
impressive as in doom but still a good
boost that boost is that the cost of
course of 400 watts of power consumption
through the 12-volt rails coming out of
the power supply a hybrid OC card is now
effectively tied with the 1080 F II card
under stock clocks but the difference
between them is within our test and test
variant so they are effectively equal
aside from the power metric which is
quite different the hybrid OC is behind
the 1080i F II card by about 20% or
behind the 1080 TI gaming X card by 24%
if you want the rest of the gaming
results including Sniper Elite for Ashes
singularity and for honor you can check
the article linked in the description
below that'll have those and will
prevent some of the copying and pasting
of the words it's not a gaming card in
the comments below so you can check that
out there if you want to see it a few
things here this card still shouldn't be
bought for gaming it never should have
been we've said that since the initial
review and the same is true kind of for
its direct competition the Titan XP but
today we're focusing on Vega versus Vega
liquid as we've created it anyway so
that's the first thing to note the
drivers still need polish not just for
gaming but for everything some of the
programs need polish there are still
issues with blender and some of them
appear to be driver side potentially in
a more kernel failure area of the
drivers so there's a lot of things that
Andy needs to improve before the card is
really bought in general by the mass
audience this was a rush launch despite
being the way we've already talked about
that the Russian was largely in the form
of drivers but rx Vegas coming up and on
the note of rx Vega the same disclaimers
here try not to extrapolate too much on
performance instead of speculating wait
for our review we'll have one and doom
I'm just mentioning this because I know
it will be posted as a seminal example
and stripped out of all context of the
rest of the review and people just share
the dune hoppers doom looks like a
really good uplift from the overclock on
this card because Vega as an
architecture will still be used in our X
Vega we could expect that overclock in
our X Vega provided there is reasonable
Headroom with our X Vega would also see
pretty good results from Dumas
specifically that said again I would
caution you to just not speculate what
the performance of our X beta will be
based on rumored clock rates or card
specifications are for our X Vegas just
just wait for that so back to what we're
supposed to be looking at Vega versus
the hybrid mod it's an interesting
question of was it worth it because it
was a hell of a lot more work than
normally thrilling the holes in the
bracket certainly added a bit of time
but then you've also got to do things
like deal with the base plate and if you
don't want to modify the base plate or
you don't want to start cutting them to
your liquid coolers
then you have to find another solution
like this or just like running more fans
over the prm's so we got pretty decent
gains in thermal performance we got
pretty decent we got excellent gains in
their own performance excellent gains in
acoustics and then in gaming some of the
performance uplift from overclocking was
to the range of 17% which if you look at
it versus a narrow overclock only a
couple percent more but way quieter and
not screaming from a blower fan so those
are all decent and worth note I am not
sure yet
what the difference is of vega's
liquid-cooled officially liquid cooled
card versus the air-cooled card
theoretically it has a bit higher power
target and that's probably because of
the reduced power leakage it's not from
something else like this modified bios
but from what we can see here there are
decent gains to be had with a good
hybrid mod whether or not you should buy
the card is a different question you can
view our review for that if you're
curious about the cards positioning
overall but that's what the hybrid model
ike uplift is good in some titles is
boring in a few of the spec you perf
tests but overall a very fun test to run
and we learned a lot about Vega about
power leakage and about how to use new
tools for our benchmarks so thank you
for watching as always you can go to
patreon.com/scishow and access if you
like these types of tests I would like
to help us do more of them buying tools
like this not necessarily cheap but
definitely worth it because we get a lot
of cool new data out of it so as always
subscribe for more we'll see you all
