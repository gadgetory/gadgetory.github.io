Vince and we showed this machine the lab
tour not sure which video is going up
first but so this is I guess at tmv 2020
FR you have a sanding machine and you
use it for laughing CPUs I brought in a
CPU Jakob informed me that it should
survive this process we hope so this is
a 99 ATX e yeah and it has not been
deleted what's what's the process we're
gonna sand down the IHS to improve
contact yep we're gonna make it nice and
flat right before that this video is
brought to you by a thermal grizzly and
their high-end thermal compounds Thermal
Grizzly makes cryo not paste for high
thermal performance and conductivity
without being electrically conductive so
you don't have to worry about shorting
components cryo knot is particularly
good for replacing stock GPU pastes as
cryo knot is a non curing compound
learn more at the link in the
description below so first of all I will
I will put some grease usually in the
vent hole okay to prevent water or a
good point or water copper can you know
getting in there dominance yeah it's not
good so I will usually just fill that
event hall just fill the vent hole a
little bit and the water won't won't go
down there so I filled these so I would
just just fill the vent hole in the high
HS with some grease to keep the water
and copper particles from going there
there was the spin out a couple hundred
rpm or something it goes all the way up
to very fast we don't need that high
though it's what do you normally use for
the RPM I usually run it around 350 okay
I use the water the whole time okay
because it'll give you a better better
sanded surface gotcha you want to remove
the you want to remove the metallic
particles okay cuz they'll Mars
so that's about it just get the water
going on the disk and give it some nice
even pressure and don't don't put too
much pressure okay just enough and we're
starting with like a two hundred grit
this is 220 usually I'll go 400 800 1200
I should make a comment here to preempt
the comments on the video people are
gonna say oh my god they're getting
water on that CPU it's okay yeah so
justjust if you don't know it's not
connected to anything there's no power
going through it so it's fine you could
I mean we could throw it in a pool and
as long as it dries out before we use it
it would be fine so you don't need to
worry about that oh wow okay you can see
that it's already and you can see you
can see where your IHS isn't flat right
right so this actually is a very
interesting test case for this I had
forgotten this when we tested this CPU
originally the quartic or Delta was 39
degrees and so like yeah 39 degree gap
yeah which is massive yeah cuz it
limited our overclocks pretty heavily
this should help yeah this should
definitely help with these new soldered
IHS is this is really the only
improvement you can make right but in
the past deleting was necessary but on
these CPUs it's really not I mean I was
able to run 6.1 without deleting it yeah
that's very good very very
Roman destroyed one of his because the
the solder flows over the edge of the
die a little bit Japan how perfect the
process is so when you shove the lid off
it cracked it yeah usually I will go
until I'd like to use the rough grits to
take off most of the most of the nickel
yeah and then when I see mostly copper I
will start using the other
okay maybe about two discs of this
patience is the key
it's gone nice and slow and this whole
process you said is 15 or 20 minutes
typically yeah roughly about 15 to 20
minutes if you want CPU as opposed to
you know what it half a day yeah I think
it took we filmed most of ours too and
cut it all out of course but I think it
took me like three hours to get a really
good sand on one of ours because you you
sand it then you test it and you realize
it was imperfect in some areas and say
have to go back and do it again and
they're all different you know some CPUs
are flat hmm the IHS will be totally
flat and others it's not so is that a do
you think that's a tolerance of IHS or a
tolerance of the way the IHS is secured
to the substrate I don't know like the
overall Z height for the IHS house what
would cause that to vary on CBS do the
stamping so they can most precisely
control and actually there is for normal
use there is no need for very high
precision for that is because subscribe
the cost and there's no practical
benefit right hey but if you like
pushing for the over the spec then you
want every bit of the
yeah do you want to try while its yet so
rough yeah let's try now can't grab the
CPU sure yeah
so you see how I'm doing it right just
just grab it like this clinch it you
play this and then just gently bring it
down until you feel it and don't don't
put pressure just sort of go a little
bit of pressure but not much and just
hold it flat like that you're just
trying to turn not allow it to go flying
yeah you don't you don't have you ever
done that yeah if that's what he was
talking about when he heard that BAM
it's the CPU bouncing around in there we
gotta edit in the pottery theme now yeah
getting there I think a little bit
longer and then we'll change the disk
okay so you just do stick on this one
until I guess you said until the nickel
is all gone basically yeah we could put
one more on okay
and I think all the nickel will be gone
after that then it's easy to use the
other groups this is significantly
easier than the manual process right we
should change the past night okay yeah
good boy now it's gonna be a little
rougher when y'all get when he first
touch it so you have a nice grip on it
it's nice and flat it's a little more
pressure now okay and then like every
once in a while I will sort of lift CPU
off rotate it I rotate it maybe 45 and
then back down got it pull it off rotate
it 45 just to make sure you're even yeah
so now you what you need to do is get a
attention fit so you can hold the CPU in
place and just automate it actually they
the manufacturer of this machine makes
this this badass arm and it has a
fixture to hold it down
it's what are you gonna do that I'm
gonna get well you just you just
adjusted the CPU size or do you have to
customize it yeah it's got like these
clamps so you can adjust it to whatever
part you're sanding see what you got oh
yeah yeah so you can see two low spots
here right alright so there's the copper
yeah and I guess the the fact that the
nickel is still showing in these other
areas does like you're saying means that
it's lower than the rest right and that
would likely contribute to our nearly 40
degree Delta we saw yep okay say your
paste is still on there so we're good
there yeah keep the water and the copper
particles out of it
Yeah right copper especially I think the
biggest benefit that you gain from this
is with the thermal grease on ellentube
it's it's huge these these uneven IHS
they will tend to leave too much thermal
grease between the two surfaces right
and that's where you get your cracking
in your freezing
okay I'm pace going bad when you see all
the grease push out almost all of it it
was just barely any trace of it left you
got the perfect contact
- right I was looking at says just metal
rain comes up yep it's secured by
anything or just lilt it pops right off
very simple and then is there like a
drain and there to get rid of the water
yeah okay cool you're gonna run a metal
pipe in for this mm-hmm
yes I mean you have to get through from
the wall right yeah the plumbing yeah I
cried my fingers off oh I am Oh aren't
that where is it I'll clean it up for
you okay
no blood here dude
thank you Steve bled on our machine
that's right you got it
I told you you won't know if your
fingers are being sanded all right
whatever
I'm more worried about holding onto the
processor right now right the skin will
come back it'll grow back yeah what are
these 1312 under this processor yeah
it's like two grand there to grad yeah
Wow
and Intel's not gonna send me another
one if I destroy it like this cuz it
works mint I made you 79 80 it's not the
same price actually did ten bucks
cheaper right okay yeah the eye is on
our smiley face are gone so that's
looking good Paul
you're almost there so as soon as you
start to see most of this gone yeah then
you're ready for the for the highest 800
grit I guess okay cool
here's the thing though with CPUs you
don't want it you don't really want it
mirror polish okay because if the grease
can when it freezes it can sort of like
slide off okay so I I really like when
I'm all done usually I will even take a
scotch brite and just lightly scuff it
right so the grease sort of has
something to grab onto that makes sense
maybe give a little more pressure now
okay and make sure it's flat and don't
forget to rotate it every month okay
this should do it you know what's funny
dude is that we were we were streaming
overclocking like about 10 years ago
yeah when we were streaming overclocking
before anybody was doing pretty much
there is also no infrastructure for
streaming
well using Justin Justin yeah same thing
I remember like doing the CNC and like
making the path and then I just watching
to talk about stuff that's actually how
we like to start by talking them things
and then yeah I met him we actually met
on a live stream he turned into one of
the live stories we were doing from my
lab yeah a great respect so he was doing
like basically like everything I think
back then I was just a student like ah
just doing their work looking at the
Corby and I just have to like short
sessions with other to like to put like
small 15 these are your oh look looks
I'm like filler onto their meal and then
like was doing all this crazy like
extremist addition CPUs for like
thousand bucks and like four-way three
ways in life right good catch I can't
even tell if it's going down at this
point that spot right there it will it's
really a very low spot very stubborn
that's probably what the side where
that's why you brought a head forward to
see on this this view yeah a couple of
the CPU is is basically floated what you
see this huge difference it's the
biggest I've ever seen I think 20 is
pretty common but you know it could be
calls from the India like inside hmm
it's not exactly flat so Vince just just
stepped in and helped out for a bit
fixing so that I guess the levelness of
the sand and now we're just on the outer
edges I'm just gripping but not applying
pressure then the center applying more
pressure right so this is what Vince
came in to do to make sure there's a
edge to edge flatness so that we don't
end up with with like the center as
lower than the outsider or vice-versa
yeah that's looking pretty good so I'm
still seeing a bit of a line here on the
outer edge we hope you see that yep
what is that your well when you were
doing it with a higher heavier clear and
you're pushing down on the outside so
that's lower than than the middle a tiny
bit I've got a tiny bit but that whole
center portion is definitely flat okay
basically what I want to see is when I
put it down I want to see the cut marks
from the paper going all the way through
from edge to edge mmm at least least in
the middle okay I think we can see that
right I just might okay that's good so I
just lightly lightly take a scotch brite
and go over it
this right here mm-hmm by using a little
less pressure when they work when you're
using the heavier grits yeah and maybe
maybe like you got a it really has to be
balanced okay
maybe you push a little bit to it this
way then push a little bit to this way
and then you'll kind of get that effect
right but that's pretty good actually
for doing such a quick job and it it
can't be any worse but what we started
with so oh my god it's horrible yeah
going forever before the nickel
disappeared right yeah yeah yeah yeah
for sure should be better yeah that will
give you a nice improvement cool so
that's the 99 80 XE modified kingpin
edition uh now we just need to do some
thermal testing run it through the same
battery that we did before sanding it
down and see what kind of improve
there is so it should definitely be an
improvement we were pretty limited
before corticoid elephants were very
high so 40 sees a lot yeah yeah so
that's it for this one check back for
the channel we have a lab tour we did we
walk through everything it's really cool
either on the channel an hour coming up
soon make sure you subscribe and I would
shake your hand but I have some blood on
myself so thanks for watching
patreon.com/scishow and access top is
how directly or kingpin cool in calm for
k peas products and of course EVGA
kingpin edition card coming up we'll
have a video on as well so I'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
