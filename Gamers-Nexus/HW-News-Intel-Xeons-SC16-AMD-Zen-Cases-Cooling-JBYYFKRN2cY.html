on Intel updates to the Xeon processor
line the AMD Boltzmann initiative
lian-li is a PCO ten case we saw at
computex but is now finally shipping and
we've got a couple of information
updates on the Boltzmann initiative and
Zen CPUs but before that this content is
brought to you by AMD SRX 470 video card
which we have found to be the best price
to performance in the sub $200 class you
can find a link below to a couple of RX
470 options so other than news and the
scientific community of the smallest
unit of time ever measured these epic
and this week also had some interesting
tidbits of information out of these
supercomputing conference so that was in
full swing this week SC 16 it is called
and intel announced its to announce two
things so intel announced the 250
million dollar investment in salt
driving cars which is of course a big
deal and they also announced in the
enthusiast world and the production
world and update to the xeon platform so
the xeon e5 2690 cpu is the new cpu that
was announced at st 16 that is a refresh
and will focus on the cpu for now the
xeon e5 2690 is a broad well II update
primarily amounting to a clock rate
increase of 200 megahertz in both a base
and boost the rest of the CPU remains it
largely the same other than price it's
now 49 hundred dollars or 49-38 if your
cadet nitpick and that's an increase of
823 dollars over the previously on
equivalent at 4115 intel says this
change increases lin pack performance by
four point eight percent which would
appeal to hpc users at least those at
the front edge of hpc and intel also ran
interestingly a technology demonstration
of its sky lake II series for the first
time which should be available in the
summer of next year skylake ewill
support AVX 512 instructions we don't
really have any hard numbers yet it's
too early for benchmarks but keep an eye
out for it in 2017 probably in mid-year
as that's generally when the e-series
platforms launch on the less concrete
side of news we have some rumors out of
the
md's and various rumor mills and this
time it's chip hell so with Andy's end
the rumors going around recently are
that the brand new initiative for the
new CPUs will feature a similar stack up
to what Intel uses that would be a three
five and seven nomenclature for the
numerical so the numerical suffix and
that would if it is real there's no
again hard evidence this but if that's
real I suppose the good news would be
that in having a more unified stack of
branding between intel and AMD hopefully
users who are less experienced in the
products of their buying will more
easily be able to compare one product to
the next between vendors when it's
otherwise normally pretty hard so if the
architectures are not linearly
comparable we've also seen summit ridge
processors rumoured at a price of around
three hundred dollars that's not
concrete or confirmed by any one
official so obviously the best thing to
do is probably wait until around CES
which is normally when and the attends
to announce things like this we'll see
if that happens CES January every year
first or second week this time it is the
first week of January we'll be there but
the rumor is about $300 the higher ends
and chips that would be your eight core
16 thread devices we'll see how that
holds what is confirmed though is an
update to am these Boltzmann initiative
which we recently spoke with Raja Kaduri
about the RTG chief architect in our GPU
open interview and with the
supercomputing conference mostly behind
us we know that AMD has released version
1.3 of rock amor the radeon open
platform and as we discussed with Kaduri
and these boltzmann initiative seeks to
convert code for other platforms like
cuda code into something that can run on
and the radeon devices this will help
AMD fight for market share and hpc and
workstation environments where cuda
presently holds a pretty significant
foothold in the user base and hip or h
IP is now entering version 1.0 use that
SC 16 to translate the cuda accelerated
cafe deep network with ninety nine point
six percent of its codebase successfully
converted by complete automation so
that's something we did speak with
Kaduri about you can check our
interviews with him on the channel there
are two and the one about GPU open
wouldn't be the
one you'd want to see for information on
this moving on to simpler topics though
lian-li is at pc 0 1 0 or 0 10 case is a
case that we saw at computex it is a
compartmentalized case and it was sort
of a half prototype then it was pretty
much confirmed to hit market we just
didn't know when and now it's been
announced and it's shipping as an
available product other than its
compartmentalization the case has its
tempered glass exterior side windows and
it's also using lian li's typical
dedication to higher quality of
materials like its obsession with
aluminum so it's aluminum and glass
those are expensive components the PCO
10 sports 240 millimeter radiators 120
millimeter and 80 millimeter fans it's
small and loud but there you have it and
it allows for reservoir fitment with
removable mounting plates the enclosure
is now available for two hundred fifty
dollars at newegg so it's a hefty price
tag but one which makes sense for
something that is again all aluminum and
glass so it might be a bit expensive for
a case but Lian Li kind of like it in
when does do a bit more leaning towards
art than function in some ways and this
is a mix of both of those tempered glass
aluminum very expensive components so
you have a 250 a lot of case now as for
other news thermals and cooling we've
seen the new thermal right cpu cooler so
this is a small form-factor cooler
targeted for the tighter cases the boxes
like you might have a sort of lenovo
style DVR style case that's what this is
more targeted at it's a medium height
it's an ax p100 hm muscle is the name of
the cooler and that is a top-down axial
fan cooler which measures at 100
millimeters for the fan and an RPM
according to thermal right is 900 to
2,500 so some of the low range there
would offer a bit more silence but we
haven't tested it yet so I don't have
numbers on how good it is the elevated
heatsink it's got kind of that design
that swoops up is equipped with six six
millimeter copper heatpipes they are all
nickel-plated as is the cold plate and
the entire base plate of the unit and
those transfer obviously your heat to
the
them fins as normally after which point
the air pushes down and dissipates the
heat pretty standard stuff so that
supports a maximum load of 200 watts and
it is the a XP 100 h muscle which should
be available at some point in the semi
immediate future so that's it for this
week as always patreon link in the post
roll video to help us out directly it

information subscribe for more I'll see
you all next time
