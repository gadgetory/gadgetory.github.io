going to be taking a look at the 1080 TI
gaming X from MSI so just at the PCV and
the make up of the different VR of the
really important V RMS for overclocking
so the ones that will actually be put
under more load if you increase core
frequency and core voltage as well as
the ones that are the ones actually you
would want to actually increase the
voltages on before that this coverage is
brought to you by the Computex
conference which runs from May 30th to
June 3rd in Taipei Taiwan this year
Computex is the biggest event of the
year for PC hardware and technology
where we preview the newest prototypes
before they come to market
we highly recommend attending or
following this event online for industry
professionals and enthusiasts learn more
at the link in the description below
before we get to the details of those
VRMs we'll go over all the different VR
atoms that power the card that I can
identify please understand I'm only ever
given pictures so the card is on the
other side of the Atlantic and a lot of
the time I just have to rely on my
ability to read component numbers and
sometimes that's just not enough to tell
what a certain set of components
actually does on the card so with that
out of the way let's get started with
the identification of the different
component r-e first of all up here we
have this which is a LDO
low dropout regulator this thing outputs
1.8 volts this is a voltage that the
NVIDIA eep ROM and some internal PLL's
of the GPU require so this right here
under it is actually the bios chip so
that explains the proximity there under
that we find this erm right here and
this is the pump voltage for the gddr5 X
chips this is also 1.8 volts however you
don't like it you just don't want to be
powering two completely separate systems
with the same vrm for basically safety
reasons so this is a necessary voltage
for the gddr5 X chips to function
however this voltage will not there is
no reason to tweak this voltage even
well you don't have access to
controlling this voltage through
software and secondly even if you did a
hardware mod on this voltage it really
doesn't do very much for if you raise it
or lower it for your ability to
overclock the gddr5 X any further now
that moving down here we find the one
volt px or PLL voltage whichever you
prefer to call it this powers some of
the GPUs internal PLL and is necessary
for the GPU to function on air cooling
and water cooling messing with this
voltage does nothing again you can't
access it through software you would
have to do a physical model on the card
to get control over this voltage and
that's only really worth it if you want
to take the card on ln2 as there because
this voltage can help with the behavior
of the card at very low temperatures
however again it's not it it's not super
important
now then moving on further behind that
we find the vcore VRM so the one that
takes up the most PCB space and is
generally the one that you'll see SPECT
in most marketing materials this
supplies the bulk of the power for the
GPU core this one you do have some very
limited software voltage control over as
1080 TI's chip with a stock voltage of
around 1.06 volts and nvidia does allow
you to tweak the voltage up to 1.09 1.09
3 volts so you can actually increase
this one a little bit and that does help
you with overclocking now then sort of
to the left of that vrm we find the
memory vrm so this power is the gddr5 X
memory chips outputs 1.3 5 volts and
this one you don't have software access
you can't control this voltage through
the software however you if you were to
actually do a physical mod to the card
tweaking this voltage should increase
gddr5 X overclocking range
not a whole lot mind you but it will
give you a few extra mega
while massively increasing power draw so
you know not really worth doing and
finally on the very end of the card we
find this little this looks to be a buck
converter and I'm going to assume that
this is the phase drive erm because I
really like every other voltage that is
necessary for the GPU core and the vram
function is already here
however V RMS actually need separate
voltages other than what the PCIe slot
and the eight pin supply so these are 12
volts power supply and this down here is
plus 12 volts and plus 3.3 volts MOSFETs
do not run on either of them so this
right here should be a 5 volt or maybe 5
to 10 volt of erm that then powers all
the actual switching capabilities of
them all set so that's what that there
is this has no impact on overclocking in
the slightest as it literally this goes
straight to the VR ends and the doesn't
affect the GPU directly in any way shape
or form so with all of the little VRMs
on the card out of the way let's start
taking a closer look at the actual V RMS
then at the two big ones which would be
the V Corps and the memory v RM so
starting with the V Corps v RM we can
clearly see we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
inductors and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16
dual fat packages so one of these is
actually a so I'll actually go over what
these are so these right here are FD PC
5 0 1 8 s GS from Fairchild
Semiconductor who are now part of on
semiconductor so they've been bought by
own semiconductor
now this is 2 MOSFETs in a single chip
so this one chip right here has both a
high side Massa and a low side MOSFET
the high-tide masa is 6.5 million of
resistance and I'm going to try get that
same bolt there 6.5 million at 4.5 volts
and the high side and the low side
MOSFET is 2.2 million ohms at the same
4.5 volts drive voltage so this is
actually a slightly higher resistance
and what the card will be running
because vrm that powers the actual yeah
the vrm that powers the view main the
main vrm will actually be outputting
something between 5 and 10 volts which
is higher than the 4.5 volt that this is
spectat so the resistance of these
MOSFETs will be slightly lower and
they'll be a little bit more efficient
however for the purpose of making sure
that my calculations don't overestimate
the capabilities of the rme I always use
the lowest voltage rating available for
the RDS on so the drain to source drain
to source on resistance yeah so we have
16 of these and then for actual control
of them vrm we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
driver IC so what this tells us is this
is a 8 phase vrm and it is a true a
phase just to based off the fact that we
have eight driver i sees there's no
doublers or quadruplet on the back of
the PCB and also this chip right here is
a that is an NCP
8 1 2 7 4 so that's an on semiconductor
of 8 phase voltage controller this does
eight phases up to 1.2 megahertz
switching frequency which is twice the
switching frequency that you will find
on any of the cards using the u p95
eleven voltage controller which is
standard for most nad t is as that is
the voltage controller that nvidia uses
on their founders edition asus uses a
gigabyte uses it as well so this card
actually has the like most complex
voltage controller out of all the 10
atti
available while not necessarily having
the largest CRM so in terms of
regulation capabilities this vrm should
be one of the cleanest running for
voltage regulation not that that will
make a huge difference in terms of
actual overclocking as you've probably
already seen from all the Rabia from
reviews of the card
speaking of reviews the full review for
this card will actually be coming out in
a few days so you know stay tuned for
that later now then with the voltage
controller out of the way let's talk
about actual current capability for the
CRM now the fdpc 50 18 SGS are slightly
worse in terms of efficiency compared to
the FPPC 80 16 sg8 yeah 80 16 SGS used
on the founders Edition 10 atti however
for MOSFETs per phase because there's
two there you know you have one high
side MOSFET and one low side MOSFET in
each of the in each of these chips and
there's two of those chips for each
phase so you can total you have four
more set a hard to keep track of
sometimes so this does actually have
more MOSFETs and if you have more
MOSFETs then it spreads the load across
them evenly which means overall this VR
I'm even using slightly worse in terms
of spec MOSFETs matches the founders
Edition founders Edition card in terms
of efficiency and powered throughput
capabilities so at 250 amps you can
expect this erm so 125 degrees operating
temperature that's because you don't
really want to push up your and past
that 125 degrees and assuming 300
colored switching frequency and 1 volt
operating voltage so core getting one
point one volts this erm at 250 amps of
load would output 15 watts of heat so
that's pretty much the same as the ref
the founders Edition at 400 amps load it
would put out 40 watts of heat
and if you had some ridiculous amount of
cooling the RM would fail at seven
hundred amps assuming you could
dissipate the hundred and twenty watts
of heat that it outputs and when it
fails the low-side mole sets of the the
low side MOSFETs would be actually what
goes not the high side though
considering that they're both in the
same package if the low side MOSFET goes
it's going to destroy the high side mall
set along with it since they are sharing
silicon so well sharing space I'm not
entirely sure how the internals are
arranged but generally dual n sets will
be one piece of silicon inside the
packaging so if the lows I'm also blows
you have to replace the whole thing
which you know that that's sort of
predictable so in terms of power
capability this vrm is has the same kind
of capability that the foundries
addition is not more efficient or less
efficient however this vrm due to its
layout will be easier to cool as it's
much more spread out than what you find
in the founders edition and also unlike
the founders edition the 10 is the
gaming axis stock heatsink is a lot
better so yeah if you want actual
detailed thermals for the vrm you will
find that in the review coming out very
soon now then moving on to the memory
the RM the memory of URM using the exact
same dual end fats so again the FT PC
50:18 from Fairchild this is a two-phase
erm controlled by a UPI u P 1658 this
goes up to 300 kilohertz on its two
phase output so this is actually one of
the slower vrm controllers on a memory
of erm amongst the 1080 T eyes however
if it really doesn't matter as nobody
actually runs their voltage controllers
at maximum frequency output because it
ruins vrm efficiency generally you will
find all the RMS running around 300 to
500 kilohertz on GPUs so this is not
really a disadvantage even though it
just does it does me
that you can actually see that switching
frequency if you forever for whatever
reason wanted to do that because as I
said it won't really do like it does
shouldn't really do anything for
overclocking on the memory as that
doesn't seem to scale from extra voltage
now then the actual current capability
of the memory VRM is it maxes out at 88
amps and I'll need to figure out where
to put this so it maxes out at 88 amps
assuming that you can dissipate 15 watts
of heat
however under normal operating
conditions this vrm should only ever be
handling about maximum of 3 30 amps to
the memory chips which leads to about 2
watts of heat output so this vrm right
here is going to run very very cool just
because the gddr5 X really doesn't need
that much power and that 30 amp figure
is actually like very much the top end
of what gddr5 X could pull so yeah this
VR M is plenty overkill for what it's
trying to do here so with that all
covered pretty much sums up all of the
vrm the memory of URM is not the
strongest one I've seen on a 1080 TI
some of the other cards have stronger
memory of erm however it is certainly
not underpowered it's perfectly capable
powering the gddr5 X it would be
perfectly capable of taking a
significant over volt if you you know
were inclined to mod your cards to do
that
the vcore vrm again it's the it's the
same right around the same current
handling capability and efficiency as
the founders edition but due to the
layout this one will run cooler so
generally you should be able to push
more current through the core of erm on
this card then on like a founders
Edition because the founders edition
will run into the RM autre just because
of how its laid out and how its cold 10
ADC eyes won't really even approach that
400 amp figure under light first of all
you're going to hit the power limit
before you get anywhere near that but
more importantly if you disable your
power limit which I will show you how to
do very soon well mostly disable it
you would still not be able to hit that
400 amp figure because the car just does
not need that much power even on liquid
nitrogen or dry ice cooling or any kind
of extreme cooling you really don't need
such a ridiculous amount of current so
mostly this really nice vrm we have here
is a nice boost to efficiency and
doesn't really do much for like it's not
like the vrm was going to be limiting
you for overclocking but then again so
would none of the other cards now then
about disabling the power limit if you
want to disable the power limit on this
card you would want to short out this
shunt that shunt and this shunt so this
mod works is basically these are very
very low resistance resistors if current
goes through them there is a very small
amount of voltage drop across them and
that is unmeasured by a chip on the card
which is located right here that
measures that and based on how much
voltage drop there is across the shunt
the card can calculate how much power is
going into it now if you want to mod the
power limit you can either you know try
do it the proper way and get like a
custom bias well you would need like the
proper way would be to get a bias with a
higher power limit unfortunately those
don't exist and aren't going to exist
any time soon due to the restrictions
and video puts on BIOS making so your
next best option is to just mess with
the circuits that actually measure input
current like the amount of power the
card is drawing so for that to do that
you would basically locate these three
resistors this one is for the PCIe slot
so if you don't want to put extra load
on your PCIe slot for whatever reason
I've never actually seen a PCI you
thought burn up yet but if you don't
want to risk you know over drawing your
PCIe slot or over drawing your
motherboards 24 pin that's usually the
bigger concern there just ignore this
one and only short out the two for the a
pin and to short them out you have the
option of either soul during another
shunt of the same value on top of them
or using a liquid metal thermal paste a
very small amount of it don't put too
much if you put too much then
you'll run into an issue but you can use
a very small amount of liquid metal
thermal paste to basically short the
shunt from like this end to this and you
just cover it up like that and you want
a thin layer because if you put too much
then the the power reading will go too
low and the Nvidia drivers will pick up
that there's something wrong with the
power reading and they'll get your card
stuck in safety mode in which case
you'll have to go and take like a
isopropanol or acetone or some other
alcohol and remove all the liquid metal
thermal paste you just put on the shunt
which you can also do it for whatever
reason the card dies like if you want to
disable if you want to take the mod off
again you know you can just wipe it off
with some kind of alcohol yeah that's
how you can mod the power limit and you
just do that on all the shunts you want
to change the readings on which I would
recommend only doing the two eight pins
but if you really want more power you
can also do this one down here so that's
it for this PCB breakdown MSI has done a
you know it's not the most powerful ten
atti PCB I've seen it's not worse than
the founders edition it's certainly not
going to limit you when overclocking in
any way shape or form it should run
cooler than a founders Edition card for
sure so this should at least have an
extended lifespan even if it doesn't
really do anything for your overclocking
capabilities so with that all said and
done thank you for watching like share
subscribe do consider donating to the
gamers Nexus patreon to support what we
do here if you would like the full
performance review of this card as well
