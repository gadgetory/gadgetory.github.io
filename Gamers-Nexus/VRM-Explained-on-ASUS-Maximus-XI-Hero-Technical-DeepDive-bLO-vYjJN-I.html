hardcore overclocking and today we're
gonna answer the one great question does
the Maximus 11 hero have a four phase or
an eight phase and the answer is I guess
you'll have to good spot to put the I to
break here Steve before that this video
is brought to you by NZXT is new h 500
case which we recently found to have an
impressively effective cooling setup
that is entirely negative pressure when
stock the h 500 is the successor of the
s 340 and s340 elite offering high build
quality that's all steel and glass and
kale management features that are also a
top class for the $70 compact mid tower
case age 500 is a part of NZXT Zanu H
series lineup which also features
options from Mini ITX micro ATX and full
ATX builds learn more at the link of the
description below how do I the answer is
it's a 4 no seriously it is a 4 and I'm
actually really surprised that Asus
decided to like go for a four phase and
I had a very long discussion about this
design decision from Asus with Elmore
who used to work at Asus until like a
couple days ago so what is going on with
this VR I'm well this block right here
is of course V core and then this this
block over here is a GPU power so we're
just gonna call that V GPU and the V
core portion looks like a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 phase except for the part where this
voltage controller is an ASP 1400 and
the ASP 1400 doesn't do eight phases it
does four plus two I think well entirely
sure about if it's plus 2 or plus 1 it
but it's probably plus 2 because that's
really not that more that that's not an
exactly rare configuration for a budget
voltage controller this really isn't
like the Asus high-end part is the ASP
1405 and this is the 1400 so this is the
the cheaper voltage controller that Asus
uses for all of their cheap or
motherboards so we already have some
cost savings here so Anri GPU is there
for
probably a two-phase now the week or vrm
doesn't use any doublers so you do end
up with a vrm that is basically groups
of two groups of two like this and that
means it's four phases and ASIS in their
defense released these lovely scope
shots which show that the new four four
phase has much better transient response
than the old extended eight phase
because and by extended they mean that
this had doublers and so let's let's
just write out what these different VRMs
were so the old one was an ASP 1405
alright so the nice expensive voltage
controller from that's probably from
international rectifier going into an IR
3599 that's how we know it's probably
from international rectifier going and
that IR 3599 was going into an IR 3535
it's how we further confirm that it was
a problem like this is probably an IR
chip so that's a 35 35 and that would
finally output to as F that F 906 small
set from the dual and fat from vishay
semiconductor that would finally shove
like and that would switch current into
the 400 nano henry inductors that Asus
likes to use and these are important
here because when you put your inductors
in parallel stuff happens to them and
and here they're not in parallel because
we do have the doubler so that that's
the old design the new design is a case
of a SP 1400 into to 630 9s and those
then output into to 400 nano Henry
doctors and the thing about this setup
is that well by having the inductors in
parallel like this and that then goes
off to vcore so this is like the one
phase of the the new design and this is
this is one phase of the old design and
the thing about this new phase with the
two
400 nano Henry inductors in parallel is
that effectively you can just ignore
that and say they're 200 nano Henry's so
their inductance gets effectively cut in
half there is a little bit of an issue
that there's like the RDS on of the
MOSFET in the way from them being
completely in parallel but you can more
or less ignore that because the RDS on
is so is so very low so you effectively
end up with an inductance of 200 nano
Henry's and the thing about having a
lower inductance is that the higher the
inductance of your inductor is the more
it resists changes in current and
transient response is all about not
blocking changes in current right it's
it's about your ability to go from 45
amps output to 193 amps output as
quickly as possible so less inductance
means better transient response so that
is already an advantage in favor of this
for phase design in this test that asus
has released right this and this mind
you is not a CPU running at 45 amps and
then 193 amps this is a synthetic load
which is why this looks so very clean
because normally if you have a CPU
running this is going to be a horrendous
mess but anyway so you know you go from
that 45 amps output 193 amp output and
you know having a lower lower inductance
on your phases helps with that
transition quite significant so already
this 8 phase is losing the the battle
like as far as being designed for maxing
out your transient response well this
should go like that should just be
replaced with 200 nano Henry inductors
instead and that would improve the
transient response here a little bit as
well now the other thing that asus
points out are like asus says they're
getting rid of the doublers because
doublers introduced some delay to your
pwm signal so the asp 1405 when when the
asp 1405 sees that you've gone from 45
amps output to suddenly a lot more you
know 193 amps output it basically goes
and towels pulls up the PWM lines and
tells all of the phases to try turn-on
as quickly as possible and the $35.99 is
in the way of doing that because the the
signal took Pole the phases hi has to go
through the $35.99 which delays it a
little bit because there's some logic in
the $35.99 and then it goes to the 35 50
35 and then to the ZF 906 now this is
another and so asus is like okay we
eliminated the $35.99 and therefore
we've eliminated the delay introduced by
the doubler which is why we're getting
this huge improvement in transient
response but do keep in mind not the
same inductors and the other thing worth
noting is the Zeff 906 is really slow
like really freaking slow this chip in
its own data sheet for 10 volts
gate-to-source so way more drive voltage
than asus ever uses and like I talked to
hell more about this apparently they
drive everything with 5 volts but anyway
with 10 volts get to source and you know
one ohm of RG so resistance on the gate
which incidentally is the typical
resistance of the gate of this MOSFET
just normally that's just kind of how
much resistance it has this thing takes
35 nanoseconds to turn on the $35.99
adds about 50 nanoseconds to of like
well 10 to 20 nanoseconds of delay to a
signal depending on what kind of signal
you're talking about like more than half
the delay in this system is from the
MOSFET I mean I'm sorry but what like
you know if this if this spike is caused
by a you know 50 nanosecond delay like
this under Xu is caused by a 50
nanosecond delay total then you could
probably get rid of a good chunk of that
delay by just changing that MOSFET or
even better get rid of the driver and
the mosfet replace it with an integrated
you use the same sic s 6:39 power stage
that would be the fairest comparison
basically what you can see in these
scope shots what
here is that the old scope shop is
showing a vrm design that really isn't
optimized to get the best transient
response right
it really isn't like that what doesn't
seem to have been the main concern of
anybody when they were building this VRM
because if it was they could have done a
lot of things to get better transient
response without having to get rid of
that doubler like there's a lot of
things I could have done they could have
reduced the output inductance they could
have actually you could keep reducing
that output inductance the reason why
you use a higher inductance inductor is
that it improves your output ripple but
if you're using a doubler and then while
actually if you just can't like if you
get a ton of phases right crank up your
switching frequency then you can use
really low inductance inductors and it
doesn't make as much of it doesn't cause
as much of a problem because you have a
lot of phases interleaving and that
inherently reduces your output ripple
without relying on a huge amount of
inductance but well Asus decided like
Asus has a ton of these 400 nano Henry
inductors and they just kind of use them
everywhere so yeah I kind of like that
I'd consider probably a cost-saving
measure as well but basically this is
not a fair comparison this vrm design
has you know it's like the 3599 puts
some delay definitely it definitely adds
some delay but so does the driver so
does the MOSFET you're using like the
delays caused by this combination right
here are different than you know what
what these have and it favors these just
because integrated like the the great
thing about power stages is that they
can turn on much much faster because the
silicon turning on your high side MOSFET
is on the same die has the high side
MOSFET
so you you can get rid of a lot of the
parasitics
that are in the way of turning on a high
side MOSFET really really quickly like
the wire that you're connecting to the
gate of the high side malfete that you
know makes it harder to drive it the
inductance of that wire makes it harder
to drive it like just power stages have
huge advantages when it comes to being
able to turn them on and off really
really quickly so in the old design is
just like you could get rid of the 3599
in there and it would probably still
like it would almost certainly still
lose on a on a transient load response
test just because of how it's built
so not a fair comparison though it is
worth noting the new design definitely
has better transient response and
because of the ZF 906 is so bloody slow
this new design actually manages to
maintain the same vrm efficiency at 500
kilohertz whereas this one if you run it
at 300 kilohertz is actually worse
efficiency at 200 amps output than the
new one so like I can totally like I can
see why the 3599 was in the old design
it was there to you know get good enough
efficiency out of the Zed f9o sixes
because these these aren't great but the
the new design you know comparing it
against the old design just isn't really
fair to the old design because the old
design was evidently never built with
considerations of like running a ninety
nine hundred K and just just worst in
every way possible really the only real
advantage is that you know it should
have a lot less input ripple because it
does have the higher inductance
inductors and higher and more phases but
you know they they'd also be running it
at a lower switching frequency to keep
the the power loss and the ZF 906 is
down and so ultimately your input and
output ripple might actually end up
being the same on the old design
compared to the new design just because
these sock oh well they're just not
really what I would like the thing is I
would just not use this MOSFET fur for a
motherboard application like the high
side is really really slow and really
really low RDS on which is like great
except for the part where like your
primary goal with the high side MOSFET
is to make it fast right like it's all
about speed the faster it can turn on
the less power loss you get especially
at lower output voltages so admittedly
like yeah just different different very
different priorities essentially between
the old design in the new design and the
new design you know prioritizes
transient response and try and
prioritize this cost savings because the
funny thing is this is cheaper than
that and $35.99 s cost zero point four
six dollars and Asus has stopped using
$35.99 on the entire Maximus 11 lineup
of motherboards there's not a single
motherboard that I'm aware of from Asus
that uses $35.99 s which means and also
with the RT X 2020 series of GPU there
there's no doublers on those either
so Asus can basically stop buying a
$35.99 S going forward and that's a huge
cost saving right like massive cost
saving so it's basically a case of like
oh yeah we're saving a bunch of money
and it just so happens that our new vrm
design is better at transient response
than the old design which really doesn't
seem to have been designed for that in
the first place it's like whoa what an
achievement you've saved money and
improved transient response great that
still doesn't change the fact that it's
a four phase and it does have all of the
downsides of a four phase compared to an
eight phase-- like for example the fact
that when one of these phases turns on
you get a 50 amp like because let's say
let's say this VR M is pushing 200 amps
output right combined across all of
these phases if it's pushing out 200
amps one of these phases turns on that
is a 50 amp spike that the input
filtering componentry has to deal with
like whereas if they were still using
doublers that spike would be 25 amps
because instead of you know having one
50 amp block turning on you'd have 25
amps separately so this would turn on
that would be a little 25 amp spike and
then the the next phase would turn on
and that would be its own little 25 amp
spike and that puts a lot less strain on
your input filtering circuit input
filtering system then you know a four
phase similarly on the output you would
have less output ripple if you just had
more phases and yeah overall it's just a
case of like this is a four phase now it
is still relatively efficient it's
really not that bad in efficiency but
that's mostly down to the s I see 6:39
is just being freakin amazing compared
to while these
so you know that's that kind of seems to
be the the logic that Isis went with is
like Oh our new power stages are so much
better than what we were using before
that we can not use the doublers will
still get perfectly good efficiency our
input ripple will go up but we can deal
with that with just better input
filtering componentry
or arguably the input filtering was
overkill for the old design and so they
didn't need to redesign that because
this sure looks like what they've been
running for every motherboard for a
while like I don't think they've changed
anything about the info filtering setup
you know save some money transient
response for improved input ripple gets
worse output ripple you can compensate
for with switching frequency as well as
with output capacitors like you can just
try redesign the output filtering and
that could fix that as well which is
rather like that's easier to do than you
know fixing something like your
transient response with with capacitors
that's actually quite hard but yeah it's
still a four-phase it's still a
four-phase and you know and with it
comes all and it does at least take like
that they do still get some advantages
that an eight phase-- would have like
because this has you know eight power
stages in it it does spread the workload
over a power stages but it's not
balanced so essentially they're they're
like normally what you would do when
doing this kind of setup is you'd like
been your power stages so that they most
equally match each other in terms of own
resistance because there's going to be
some manufacturing variance between them
and if you put one power stage that's
like a lot lower resistance than another
one then you know you'd have problems
well you'd have one pushing more current
than the other but basically you have
less than ideal efficiency with this
less than ideal a ripple situation but
uh but you still get the benefit of like
okay so we spread the the heat output
across more or less eight components not
quite perfectly evenly but pretty much
evenly there's not going to be that much
variance between them there will be some
but no you know extreme amounts and yeah
so you you have something that's that's
a four fate like it's a
it's a massive for face that's like the
best way to describe it because each of
these si si 639 s is a 50-amp dr moss so
you effectively like have a hundred amp
peak output capability phase and you
have four of them which is uh like
that's just kind of silly sure like you
can do that there's nothing really
stopping you from doing that it's just
you know just not an eight it's not an
eight phase-- so the end result here is
that in terms of erm efficiency this vrm
also doesn't win any awards because well
the the new new power stages are great
but there's not quite it like there's
other board vendors with just more
phases and more phases generally means
easier time dissipating the heat easier
time getting higher efficiency right
like admittedly Asus could have probably
put like three power stages next to each
other there's really nothing stopping
them like I actually said like why don't
you just put three of them next to each
other and they're like yeah we could we
just don't feel like doing that as well
I guess eventually Asus will will will
do that as well at that point I really
hope they bump up the the inductions of
their inductors because at that point
it'd be cutting one third and then at
that point they might start having an
output ripple problem though they might
also go like oh yeah but are trying to
get response I lost an even better so
screw it anyway
output efficiencies so 500 kilohertz
switching frequency which is a huge
advantage over the old design like the
old design would have been 300 kilohertz
oh well 300 kilohertz max because if you
want much past that it would get really
inefficient and if you wanted to run it
efficient like more efficiently you
could have gone down to like 250
but anyway 500 kilohertz here 5 volts
drive the RV and 150 amp and then like
the the datasheet for the s IC 6:39
suspect in 1 volt output and I've scaled
it up based off of fishin C to 1.3 volts
output which is kind of worst-case
scenario scaling because
generally power stages get a bit better
with with higher output voltage but it
really depends on how they're designed
so like you could in theory it would be
possible to design them that they have
peak efficiency at 1 volt output and it
just gets worse from there so anyway 150
amps output these this vrm would produce
about 13 watts of heat at 1 volt and
about 17 watts of heat at one point 3
volts for 200 amps output you'd be
looking at about 20 watts of heat and 26
watts at one point 3 volts possibly less
250 amps output and also this is like
9700 K 8086 K 8700 K completely maxed
out this is 99 hundred K pretty much
maxing out any kind of cooling system so
250 amps output you'd be looking at you
know 30 watts at 1 volt and about 39
watts at 1.3 volts and then 300 amps
output you'd be looking at about 40
watts at 1 volt and 51 watts at 1.3
volts and 400
it doesn't go up to 400 it goes up to
360 amps because while these are 50 amp
hour stages they do only the the
datasheet
ends at 45 amps output which is pretty
normal for most high-end power stages is
just like practically speaking pushing
the rated current through a power stage
is not practical so that's something to
keep in mind you know and the end result
is that you can these are I can only go
up to like 360 amps here it's 360 amps
output 1 volt
63 watts and 1.3 volts you probably be
looking at around 82 so yeah this this
definitely doesn't win any vrm you know
awards for vrm efficiency if they put
more power stages in it they they could
have improved the figures a bit they
wouldn't even need to increase the phase
count but I guess they'd start running
like they'd have to relay out the board
a bit to accommodate all the extra all
the extra power stages
and the other option they could have
gone for is like a 5 plus 2 phase
controller but at that point they'd have
to upgrade the controller to something
more expensive and yeah they're not
gonna do that if they're saving money by
getting rid of $35.99 yeah I don't think
they're gonna be upgrading the voltage
controller so yeah I mean it's not
winning any awards for efficiency it's
not terrible either right like this
fall's pretty much in line with the
asrock taiichi ultimate board it is just
worth noting that the taichi ultimate
probably has a better heatsink than this
it also has I'm not sure if it actually
has more surface area but like it really
like you know if you have the same heat
output as your competitor then you
better hope you have a better eat sink
because if they have a better heat sinks
are winning so that's one thing to keep
in mind and yeah it's just efficiency
wise you know it's not no incredible the
other thing is I with these efficiency
figures I am assuming completely even
load load spreading across the the power
stages which while that would you know
like imbalanced loading of the power
stages would maybe were like decrease
the power efficiency by a couple
percentage points as well so that's
another thing to consider is just like
there's no current balancing on this
thing other than like hopefully they
matched up the the power stages pretty
well or that there wasn't too much
manufacturing variance between the power
stages so yeah is it's a four-phase it's
not the most efficient thing ever it
does get really great transient response
but they could have probably just done
better on the old design anyway I'm not
impressed and especially at like $300
that Asus charges for this motherboard
it's just like I know for a fact there
are other boards that have more
efficient VRMs I know for a fact there
are a bunch of boards with more phases
than this vrm like way more phases like
some of them have like three times as
many phases that are like out of phase
with each other because they use
doublers
and aren't trying to save money on you
know low-cost voltage controllers and
getting rid of chips that cost less than
half a dollar though admittedly once you
spread that over the fact that Asus is
dropping the the doublers off of their
entire lineup it starts making sense
that you know that's that's a pretty
significant cost saving and basically
like ultimately I think the the Asus
claims to the great transient response
like you'd really have to test this in
the real world like you'd have to take
this motherboard and compare it against
a bunch of other motherboards with like
the same CPU and try work all of the
motherboards down to like like you'd
have to have a ho Silla scope hooked up
to it at the same time and just like
compare the the output on every single
one of the boards and just see which
motherboard ultimately you know can run
the lowest of all run the chip at the
lowest voltage and I honestly don't I'm
not sure that you would see a huge
difference the the one thing I've
noticed throughout testing a lot of
motherboards is once you sort of like
once you get a four phase and then go
past like admittedly that was with like
seventy seven hundred KS and and like
eighty seven hundred KS once you had
four phases you kinda were good enough
for quite a lot of the higher current
outputs but then the ninety nine hundred
K pulls more power than any more current
than anything before it so you know it
might turn out that this this decided
design decision by asus know in the real
world is actually a fail like somebody
would have to actually test it and just
see like which of the existing
motherboards can go down to the lowest
voltage I have a hard time like I don't
think this this big improvement in
transient response in the real world
will actually translate quite the
advantage that these scope shots may
make it look like it would so also it's
like also the other thing is you have to
consider that everybody like no as far
as I'm aware I don't think anybody has a
vrm that looks quite light like far as
I'm aware a lot of these like the other
Z 319 boards don't have a VR em that
looks like this so
yeah I mean I can like it's it's mostly
a cost-saving thing
it's a cost-saving thing because they
they save on the $35.99 s the transient
response you know they've improved that
but I mean there there was ways to
improve that without getting rid of the
bloody doublers so it's just like I
don't know you know you you need to test
this in the real world
efficiency wise it's not exactly
groundbreaking and at the same time you
know asus has some of the more aesthetic
oriented heat sinks out there so yeah
you know testing needed and actually for
vrm thermals we already know for a fact
that this is one of the hottest running
motherboards in the $300 price category
and I'm not surprised like this is like
because the thing is like even within
the same efficiency they just have the
heat spread of cloths less components
and that already hurts your vrm thermals
so yeah I'm I'm not impressed
I'm really not impressed with what Isis
has done here then again Asus rarely
manages to impress me with their VR M's
most of the time because most of the
time asus has an approach to the RM
design that's very much a case of good
enough right like they've had the same
eight phase VR I am on their high-end
desktop motherboards since x79
and I'd argue that 4 X 299 it's really
not good enough but hey that didn't stop
Isis from keep reusing it over and over
and over and over and over again and I
also don't think it's good enough for X
399 either but they used it there as
well so yeah that's kind of that anyway
let's cover some of the other stuff on
this board since we do have just about
enough time to do that so VC C IO vccs a
and our located down here you have a
clear CMOS and flashback on the rear i/o
BIOS flash back on the rear i/o there
the extra 4 pin power connector is a
optional your 9900 K is going to be
uncool Abul before you max out your
single it--the in unless you deal it and
like run liquid metal maybe send down
the die you really will probably you
know
max out your cooling system before you
max out the pin power connector you have
a postcode up here you have some
troubleshooting LEDs below that these
are color-coded which I really really
like because a lot of other board
vendors what they'll do is they'll put
them in the same color and then one of
them lights up and it's like well I
don't know which led it is because
they're they occupy three you know like
half a centimeter of space on the
motherboard so it's really hard to tell
which of the four LEDs lit up if it's
not one of the one of the not one of the
ones on the edges and they're all the
same color when they're glowing you know
you look at it and it's just like well I
can't see anything the LED lit up and
it's blinding me so it's nice that Asus
color codes these because that makes it
much easier to figure out which one
which ones going off you have a power
button reset switch to phase vrm from
memory power this is a standard asus
memory vrm they've been using it for
years as well controlled by asus
favorite asp well that's another one of
those rebrands but ASP 1103 we've been
seeing this chip for ages and ages and
ages from Asus going down the board we
also have a retry button down here and a
memo case which I don't understand what
this is supposed to achieve apparently
it allows the board like it disables and
enables the motherboards ability to
retrain which seems really stupid
because motherboards tend to get stuck
in real like boot loops when you let
them retrain forever I would have much
preferred if they had kept like like if
this either had a safe boot button or
the old or the old memo ke button the
old memo okay boss and want you what
would what would it what it would do is
if you would get bad memory settings
you'd hit the memo okay button and it
will load up it would basically wipe
your memory settings and load up some
really nice safe presets
whereas this seems to just be kind of
like train until it works and hope for
the best which generally tends to be a
terrible idea because boards tend to not
like a lot of boards when they get stuck
on training they're they're stuck on
training they don't tend to ever figure
out what's wrong so not a huge fan of
that especially because the retry button
will help like it gives you the
retraining capability anyway like you
can just use that and also that's like a
hard reset button
oh yeah board doesn't have dual BIOS
because you know Isis doesn't doesn't do
dual BIOS for a lot of they're cheaper
boards which this isn't even cheaper but
the thing is Asus really considers like
for Intel motherboards and the z3 nine
like Intel motherboards from Asus $300
price tag that Asus considers that
mid-range which is why I you know
there's they expect you to use this with
like a 9700 K and the vrm kind of
reflects that as far as I'm concerned
because at least at 150 amps output it
really like you know it's producing very
little heat whatsoever so yeah that is
the Maximus 11 hero it is a four phase
it's four plus to an Asus might want to
call it a twin eight phase but the fact
of the matter is those phases aren't out
it like there's only four signals out of
phase with each other I don't know what
other things could be out of phase here
but there's only four of them you know
that that's kind of the point of having
phases that they're out of phase if
you're gonna be shoving one PWM signal
into two power stages they're not gonna
be out of phase with each other you
can't call them separate phases that's
like if three phase power was made with
one sine wave on three different wires
and that's the sine wave was in phase
with each other like that's basically
what what they're saying like no it
doesn't work like that so yeah that is
it for the video for $300 I really think
this is I mean you know I guess you get
the Asus tax for Asus BIOS I guess
because that's that's one of the things
where ace is still absolutely dominates
is probably the BIOS but you can learn a
gigabyte BIOS you can't fix the VR hand
right like you're not gonna be like
you're not gonna be replacing the VR I'm
on board
you can also well you can tolerate
asrock BIOS as far as I'm concerned like
I don't have a problem learning it it's
just janky as hell to use as far as I'm
concerned so yeah that is it thank you
for watching like share subscribe if you
have any comments questions suggestions
you can leave them down in the comment
section below and we'd like to support
gamers Nexus we do have a patreon as
well as store dog gamers Nexus not where
you can pick up things like
as well as the mod man that you can see
in the background of the photo here and
yeah that's oh and I have a channel
called actually hardcore overclocking if
you'd uh where I do more overclocking
relates at Compton so if you'd like to
check that out you know that would be
awesome thank you for watching and good
