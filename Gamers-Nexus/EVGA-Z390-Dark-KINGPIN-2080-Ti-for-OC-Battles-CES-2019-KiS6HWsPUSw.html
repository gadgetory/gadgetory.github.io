literally purpose-built for our
competition with Jays two cents there
was actually no other reason to make it
other than to escalate the overclocking
conflicts with Jay but the card will
become publicly available at some point
in the future as well because we are we
are very generous like that evj also had
the z3 90 dark available at their suite
for at least early photography and video
and they had some 2060s we'll be talking
about all of those today
from EVGA sweet at CES 2019 before that
this video is brought to you by
Thermaltake score p3 case the core p3 is
one of the most unique cases on the
market it can serve as an open-air
standing chassis a test bench in
vertical or horizontal orientation or as
a wall-mounted showcase pc the core p3
now comes with a 5 millimeter thick
tempered glass panel for its slide but
keeps the front top and back open for
air the core p3 is versatility as a
display piece test bench or standard
desktop is reinforced by its price of
roughly 110 dollars on Amazon you can
learn more at the link in the
description below
getting straight into the electrical
details of the kingpin card first of all
the kingpin cards if you don't know they
are high-end overclocking card just
typically associated with extreme
overclocking you can use them out of box
but that's not really how they're meant
to be used the twenty atti kingpin PCB
is a 12 layer design that uses a digital
mps two eight eight eight a controller
with 16 MP eight six nine five six 60
amp power stages with memory VRMs using
three of the same 60 amp power stages
for extra overkill FB vdd power is a
single-phase digital control vrm the
card also has a 3/8 pin power connectors
accompanied by a 520 watt maximum TDP
rating in the overclocking v bios this
is one of the most important aspects
because it lifts the biggest restriction
and taurine which is the power limit
technically it should be possible for
users to override the voltage provision
to the card past what Nvidia allows but
that might require some softer mods but
nothing too crazy on this card
taurine is most limited by power and
voltage and the kingpin card gives you
the tools to try and overcome those
limits for the basics the king pin 20
atti uses an ace
Tech 120-millimeter see I'll see you for
the GPU core moved up to the Gen 6 pump
from Gen 4.5 previously technically Gen
4.5 has a natively higher pump speed but
Gen 6 switches to a metal impeller from
the plastic one before it which we
showed him to tear down previously the
differences don't really matter that
much from a performance standpoint the
Gen 4.5 and Gen 5 pumps are often better
or within margin of error but the gen 6
pump does reduce permeation and should
therefore reduce pump wine and age which
is with age which is something that you
all have complained about with the other
EVGA hybrid cards we'll see how it does
but Genesis should theoretically reduce
wine but we'll see the card also has pin
outs for evbot and i2c connectors or pro
bits connectors so anyone with an
external voltage controller could hook
into the kingpin card from what was
explained to us and attempt to override
NVIDIA voltage limits a 4-pin fan header
is also present on this part of the
board near the probit header which you
can use for DMM measurements if you want
a direct read of what the card is
dealing with for voltages price is TBD
as for the z3 90 dark motherboard
following the ex 299 darks leadership
presence in overclocking the z3 90 dark
changes socket orientation completely
with a 90 degrees counterclockwise
rotation the socket rotates to the side
positioning the BRM toward the i/o area
and moving the memory sockets up toward
the usual residency for EPS 12-volt
cables this will undoubtedly cause
clearance issues with CL CS in many
cases so keep that in mind unfortunately
the only real solution here is to plan
around that limitation there are only
two DIMM slots on this board which will
improve memory overclocking capabilities
but limit capacity this isn't something
you want for your daily driver build
this is an overclocking motherboard
the result is a movement of the EPS 12
volt header to be adjacent to the 24 pin
header cleaning up cabling without
introducing as many of the electrical
wiring difficulties that would be faced
of the socket were in a normal
orientation the board runs a 12 phase B
core with 60 amp hour stages the ISL 992
7s with the voltage controller in the
form of the is l69 138 VSA power is a
single is all nine 911 for 0 40 amp hour
stage and VCC i/o is a single phase of
the same power stage and the CPU
graphics vrm uses a 69 133 controller
and
is l99 2760 empower stages memory is a
single nine nine two two seven sixteen
power stage and don't worry we all have
a build droid analysis of all this in
the future
Mac CPU power rating for the board is
about eight hundred watts on the Z 390
dark and finally evj also had its r-tx
2060 cards present the cards were the XC
SC + XC ultra with XE ultra in a six
plus two phase design and the XC and SC
at 4 + 2 phase designs with even the
smallest of cards still using a 2.8 slot
design we might talk about these more
later but that'll wrap up EVGA sweet for
now the biggest news items here would be
the kingpin card on the C 390 dark we
hope to get both so check back for our
reviews or work with those devices you

see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
