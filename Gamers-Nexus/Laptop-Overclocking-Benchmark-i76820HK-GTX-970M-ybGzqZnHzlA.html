increases in the clock rate of a GPU or
CPU but in laptops there's always been
somewhat of a limitation on how far you
can go and that's often a thermal
restriction because you've got a limited
area you can cool there's immutable
cooling you can't just throw a bigger
heatsink on there and it's also been
because of the components
now with the new i7 6820 HK that is
actually an unlocked mobile CPU so you
can overclock it through BIOS as you
would normally do with any desktop CPU
there's also the gtx 970m and this thing
and more recently the GTX 980 launched
to four laptops that is a desktop part
in laptops we tested that and we're able
to offset the clock by about 200
megahertz which is pretty darn big and
actually does have a noticeable gain in
some gaming experiences now with CPU
overclocking on a laptop in particular
we're looking at more than just gaming
this time we are overclocking these 6820
HK that's the brand new unlocked CPU in
here with a 970 m and then testing to
see how does that impact production
workloads alongside gaming so we test a
few games and then we're testing
Photoshop transforms batch processing
video editing all these things and those
are very important for this type of
laptop because a gaming laptop is often
what gets deployed in production use
cases in the field so we use gaming
laptops for our video and photo
processing when we recover in CES and
that's what we're testing today how does
this impact the gaming and production
experience with CPU and GPU overclocking
the laptop we're using for these tests
is the 1885 dollar fame book for sk7 300
CyberPower laptop and that has forged
specs an i7 6820 HK processor which is
unlocked and shipped stock at 2.7
gigahertz turbos to 3.6 gigahertz and
has eight megabytes of cache the gtx
970m and video GPU is on there for the
video card and that is also unlocked to
some degree you can overclock that and
the main concerns we're going to be
looking at our thermals primarily but
we're also just looking at how far can
we push these things before they become
unstable we use the witcher 3 dirt GTA 5
Metro last light and
mordor alongside a few other games for
our benchmarks and as always the full
methodology with a huge list of tables
for our production workloads is linked
in the description below if you want to
learn how we did these and see what was
used for the testing let's start with
our overclocking results and then move
on to the benchmarks this table shows
the incremental testing of our overclock
and shows how we achieved our final
resting clock rate of 4.0 gigahertz we
attempted 4.2 and 4.1 but they were
unstable and without a lot of
fine-tuning it just it didn't look like
it was gonna be a good fit and so we
settled on 4.0 gigahertz which is a
reasonable overclock from the 2.7 stock
and 3.6 turbo the GPU we overclocked
successfully to 1170 2.3 megahertz which
is actually the maximum allowable
overclock it is limited to a 135
megahertz offset from base and we ended
up with a 1450 3.5 megahertz memory
clock which is 400 megahertz
offset from base previously we did this
with a Dominator Pro G with a GTX 980
desktop part so there's actually a
desktop part in a laptop and that
progression is shown here if you're
curious let's start with thermals that
is what the overclocking will most
immediately impact on a laptop the fame
book for is a gtx 970m silicon rest at
41.3 celsius delta t / ambient when at
stock clocks and the temperature
increases marginally nine point four
four percent difference between the two
when overclocking the GPU and CPU in
conjunction the i7 68 20 HK has a very
slight increase in thermals at 39
Celsius to forty two point eight to
Celsius post overclock the CPU turbo
boosts a 3.6 gigahertz when under load
and that is the case for the above chart
here are two thermal overtime charge to
show additional data the wave pattern
you're seeing and the GPU one is a
result of fan spin up and spin down as
the GPU achieves the required heat
thresholds for rpm increases which
appears to be about 45 degrees Celsius
delta T on the GPU side now it's time to
move on to the production workload
benchmarks we don't normally do these
but for a laptop like this where it
might get deployed in the field and used
for everyday production tasks for
Photoshop and Premiere users things like
that is absolutely worth doing and
that's what we're looking at here for
most menial tab
anything for example that requires
around six seconds or fewer to complete
we saw in consequential real-world
impact from overclocking even when the
gains may be nearly 10 percent the
observable difference in such an
instance is effectively non-existent for
example zero point eight nine seconds
image resize time versus zero point nine
eight seconds is a almost ten percent
difference but it's effectively
imperceptible for the more intensive
actions like the application of filters
to large files in Photoshop we actually
did see measurable worthwhile increases
in performance take our Photoshop lens
blur test as an easy real-world example
processing time to apply the lens blur
filter shows a difference of twenty
point four percent between the stock and
overclocked tests and that produces a
little over twenty seconds difference in
this instance that's a huge chunk of
time and for larger files or more
complex filters the twenty percent
performance difference will be
noticeable and will improve productivity
of the user for video editing testing
through PC Mark we saw a difference of
twenty-one point four two percent that's
the Delta between the two clock raids
and this reduced render time from one
forty 6.8 seconds to one hundred 18.4
seconds averaged across three tightly
consistent runs and again that's
noticeable with large files or with
frequent production moving on to gaming
let's look at a few FPS differences
between the stock and overclocks laptops
these games are generally bound by the
gtx 970m and won't show massive CPU
overclock gains to show the CPU
independently really producing a
difference we would have to drop the
resolution substantially or drop the
quality settings and at that point it's
no longer a real-world scenario because
no one's gonna do that it's just it's
not worth it GTA 5 moves from 48 FPS to
55 FPS Delta 13.6% post overclocked and
whether or not that's actually visible
during gameplay does remain questionable
the 13.6% Delta may be noticeable in
periods of severe frame drops but
generally we'd think not shadow of
mordor is a 1 FPS difference between the
CPU only OC and stock clock laptop tests
there's effectively no difference here
the GPU OC generates an eleven point
seven six percent Delta between clock
and
U+ CPU OSI configurations but again
potentially not that noticeable even
with the couple FPS gap it's just it's
not something you're necessarily gonna
pick up on as a user especially because
the 1% and 0.1% frame times are so
tightly timed dirt rally shows about a 1
FPS gain for the CPU only OSI test in
line with the previous benchmark the GPU
and CPU laptop OSI pushes 61.7 FPS
which is a 7 FPS gain over stock or
Delta of 12 point 7 6 percent this is
noteworthy because we're now exceeding
60 FPS which to some folks is a magic
number that's always in demand
this pattern persists through The
Witcher 3 and Metro last light and you
can read more about those tests in the
link in the description below
we are thoroughly impressed with the
laptop as a whole and the overclocking
potential of the 6820 HK which again is
an unlocked Intel CPU because it's got
that K signifier then and the 970m
whether or not it's worth overclocking
such a laptop is the big question here
and for gaming my answer very plainly is
no it is generally not worth
overclocking even with the couple
percent difference you see in some of
these games the actual perceptible
difference is marginal and it doesn't
generally a whole lot more heat but just
because it doesn't generate a lot of
heat doesn't mean that the CPU and GPU
are happy increasing the voltage to
these devices which is what overclocking
and part does can actually damage their
long-term potential so it's not
something you really want to do for a
couple FPS gain the risks reward just
isn't there for production however I
will say that we will be configuring OC
profiles on our production game and
laptops that we take to the field
because the difference of 20% and a
render time is enough that we might be
able to finish one more video before
that next meeting and from a production
standpoint that is big because time is
money produce an extra video that's more
money you're making and that's just how
the stuff works
so for anyone who is a production user
on premiere or Photoshop it may be worth
considering an overclock on something
like a 68 20 HK for your on-the-go
system and that's something that I would
do somewhat sparingly I'd probably save
it as a profile if possible and then
just apply it when I'm
and I know I really need the extra 10
minutes at the end of my render because
I'm on a tight schedule but for the most
part if you're just gonna let it render
overnight I'd probably leave it alone
because you know why burn cycles on
something if you're just gonna go to
sleep and it's gonna be done anyway when
you wake up so whether it's worth it or
not forgave me no production probably
yes but in sparing situations is how I
would answer that as for the review of
this thing this is not a review so
you'll find that in the near future this
is the first 970m we've worked with if
you're curious about other gaming
laptops we've worked on the 980 m and
980 versions of the GT 72 from MSI and
CyberPower and you can check those of
course in the channel if you're curious
