now at Computex 2018 they have two main
cases and then some fans and power
supplies so in win always does a
Signature Series case at copy tax and
CES they've done it again we're gonna
push that to the back half the video
because I'm sure you've seen a lot of
that already this is the 307 we'll start
with this one before that this video is
brought to you by thermal takes view 37
case the vo 37 focuses on highlighting
custom PC builds with its full panoramic
window and tinted front acrylic and our
thermal testing the view 37 performed
reasonably well when considering its
looks focused build which is partly
thanks to the airflow design and the
removal of a bottom power supply shroud
for a balance of looks and performance
check the link in the description below
for the view 37 so the in wind 307 is a
it's a three or three tooling so if
you're familiar with the 303 same idea
the difference is they stuck a different
panel on the front of it I will quickly
point out this case this isn't going to
be the final colors we have some b-roll
of one that will be the final colors
there's gonna be a white not this off
green that the prototype is here so just
kind of ignore that for now but the LED
plate on the front is what you need to
pay attention to so basically it's 8 by
18 LEDs they are programmable and
addressable via software there's a
button on the side where you can toggle
what it's doing but if you go through
software I suppose the idea the gimmick
if you will of this case is that you can
individually program which LED light up
one and then animated in sequence so if
you wanted to do functionally and
animated I'm gonna piss a lot of people
off Jif on the front of your case you
could do that and it has a couple of
different frames that it can cycle
between giving in this instance these
space invaders look so kind of neat it's
definitely a different implementation of
RGB LEDs anyone previously had the
infinity case which had an infinity
mirror on it and LEDs around the border
so this is kind of like a similar idea
where the front panel has been swapped
out for something on the 303 for
something that's just loaded with LEDs
144 LEDs I think on this one and then so
that's the 307 the tooling is the 303 as
noted not 100% sure on the stock specs
and terms of fans or price but it's
looking like close to 300 dollars
probably for this case so a bit of a
showpiece for sure
the most practical if you want something
practical anyone's shown the a one case
a lot now for at least a year
so that's finally in the market if
you've been waiting for the a1 Mini ITX
case it's out there we'll be reviewing
it once you're back that's on the
practical side I guess we'll go through
the the new Signature Series case as
well so that's behind me we have some
b-roll of it it's a Z Series case it's
basically shaped like a vortex like an
airflow vortex and it has something like
a zebra pattern holes in it the fun part
is that it's extremely thick aluminum
and a lot of aluminum so it weighs about
90 pounds it's empty and the paneling on
it they've got one out that's just out
to pick up pretty hefty so 90 pounds of
aluminum the thickest part is something
to pay on how you measure it if you
cross section it's like centimeter thick
basically so very thick for any aluminum
paneling at all and that's going to make
it expensive we don't 100% sure know the
price on it couple grand plus probably
several so that's that's the new
Signature Series case more practical
stuff the crown fan is brand new so this
is pretty interesting actually basically
I think I've seen this maybe once before
I don't know if it came to market but
the entire frame spins so I mean the
black part is the real frame that's what
you mount in the case but the outer
circular shell around the fan blades
where it too next to the blades spins
with the rest of the fan so we've seen
stuff like this I'm not sure if we've
ever seen it really come to market in a
successful way so anyone's gonna give it
a shot that's the crown fan comes in 140
and 120 s and we'll talk about it more
in the future I'm sure but it's got LEDs
in it as well of course as does
everything these days and then they also
have a premium basic power supply as
brand new power supply line the only
really interesting thing on that that's
worthy of note is it's got two LED
connectors on it on the power supply
natively so where you plug in all of
your ATX cables you can also plug in RGB
LED cables and that allows it to
communicate with a motherboard or
whatever other device you have plugged
in maybe one of the RGB controllers on
the market so the idea being you can
synchronize the power supply RGB LEDs
with the rest of the system if you
wanted to typically they're isolated
systems they can't communicate with one
another alternatively it's got an out so
it can do RGB out into whatever the
baby and then when you push the button
on the back of power supply to change
the power supply color but also changes
the color of the device that is attached
to it via the out port so that's all of
a minute in one's main parts here at
