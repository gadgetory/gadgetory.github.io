gigabyte microSD cards that a viewer
sent in but they say they're 32
gigabytes and they say their Samsung
except we know that they're not in
reality this is a common scam and it's
one that we covered a few years ago and
our one terabyte USB drives scam video
it's gotten so pervasive with SD cards
though that even retail stores and the
likes of Amazon have ended up
unwittingly selling cards with
illegitimate capacities and fake
branding today we're looking at the
micro SD card sent to our P o box by one
of our viewers to see why they were sent
to us before that this video is brought
to you by e BJ's a new audio sound card
engineered by audio note EVGA CEO knows
high quality audio and has begun
bringing sound cards back the new audio
sound card is capable of delivering
hair-raising audio superior to onboard
sound the card includes a line in
headphone line out and mic in and a Sony
Philips digital interface new audio also
leverages EBG ace PCB design experience
has upgradeable op amps and uses a km
premium components for its DAC and ADC
learn more at the link in the
description below the viewer who sent
these sent a lot of them and knew that
they were fake and there's more by the
way we just what was nearby the reason
they were sent is because they're just
kind of interesting it's a really common
scam except it's pulled off with such
success that even a knowledgeable user
like likely all of you could end up
falling victim to it and it's not even
for any fault of your own it's just
because retail stores and e-tailers may
end up accidentally occasionally selling
fake SD cards and it's not because
they're the ones trying to scam you it's
because they two got tricked it or duped
by something that's a pretty damn good
fake so the way this works well we'll
talk about that momentarily but the top
level is that it says it's 32 gigabytes
or it says it's some capacity that it
isn't like the 1 terabyte USB key that
we looked at years ago and in reality
although it shows up as that capacity in
Windows you can't actually write that
amount of data to it so pretty
straightforward really easy in terms of
figuring out that
you've been scammed pretty much
immediately I'll have to do is write a
large file to it so from what the viewer
who sent these in to us told us to the
best of our recollection it was during
the stream ages ago our understanding is
that one of the easiest ways to tell
that this particular model is fake is
because this punch out piece on the
cardboard packaging is there and
apparently on the fakes that's something
that happens whereas on the real ones
that will actually be punched out so
small details like that other small
details like the lack of some of the
copyright or trademark symbols and areas
where they would make sense to be or
typically it would be on the card itself
there's some low resolution imaging the
actual logo appears to just be screened
on there in a way that's not
particularly high quality and this is
stuff that Patrick looked into as well
and I'm sure we'll show b-roll of him
pointing out some of these things on the
camera the adapter is also not
particularly high quality is just a pin
to pin adapter but the real problem is
again it's not 32 gigabytes and the
viewer knew that these were not 32
gigabytes sent them in for us to look at
so some of the external signs that this
is fake include the following the
product code on the box doesn't match
the code on the SD card which is a
telltale sign that it's fake the card
uses the China export logo instead of
the actual seee marking and there's
slight differences between those but
their images online that's sure the
difference will pop that on the screen
it also looks like the packaging was
photocopied from the actual Samsung
packaging although there are some key
differences like on the front of the
packaging the Samsung logo is in the top
left for the legitimate package with the
hole punched out whereas it's in the top
center for the fake product and the hole
is not punched out separately the
sticker code on the back of the
packaging for our SD cards is for a
different product than the packaging
itself disclaims we're looking at MP 32
da /am for one of them while the
packaging reads MP 32 da / APC these are
different product SKUs the color in the
samsung text on the micro SD card is in
off blue whereas the legitimate color
should be a great
and the same is true for the bottom
right microSD card text where it should
be gray and the real product versus off
blue in the fake when you first load the
SD card into a system it'll show up in
Windows as a fat32 formatted file system
with 32 gigabytes of storage available
this is the maximum volume size for
fat32 and also there's a maximum file
size of 4 gigabytes for this file system
trying to write a file greater than 4
gigabytes results in a file system right
error which is expected that's not
because the SD card exclusively anyway
that's fine though when trying to write
a 3 gigabyte media files the SD card we
encountered write speeds of about 5.5 5
megabytes per second to 8 megabytes per
second blazing fast which is awfully low
for sequential writes on a drive
advertising quote ultra-fast 48
megabytes per second performance that's
as bytes with the capital B and not bits
in case anyone was confused although
we're closer to bits performance here
mega may be 64 megabits per second it
still wrote to the drive though we next
wrote another three and a half gigabyte
file immediately encounter and a failed
write it stops before the 50% point
indicating that our SD card is
potentially limited at somewhere between
4 to 8 gigabytes in reality although
it's difficult to tell the card also
stopped displaying in Windows at this
point so we ejecta dit and reloaded it
the SD card then reported that both
files were present despite indicating a
failed right but this was quickly
countered by trying to play back one of
the media files we were met with this
colorful image and a whole lot of
corruption the video playback was
corrupted in various ways both audio and
video and the file was incomplete this
is in spite of Windows reporting that we
had filled 6.4 gigabytes of space
leaving 24.8 gigabytes of allegedly free
space so as a user who is perhaps not
privy to this type of scam you would
think that the SD card should be fine
although you may have encountered an
error it should still work
we had Patrick test a different SD card
by using H to test W version 1.4 1.3 the
software reported the following output
and on the screen now and seems to test
16 gigabytes of data as quote ok with
the remaining 15 point 2 gigabytes lost
during write this drive that he tested
was a different one had a bit
a usable space than the one that I
tested previously but it's still not 32
gigabytes of the advertised capacity it
seems like they're kind of randomized
it's certainly not the advertised speed
at this point we knew that all of these
cards were fake so it was just a matter
of figuring out how it works and why and
one of our previous pieces looking at
scam hardware we talked about how a
repurposed a 650 TI GPU was branded as a
1050 by using custom firmware we
suspected something similar here custom
firmware but reached out to storage
expert and former storage reviewer Allen
Melvin tano for assistance Allen
explained the following to us he said
firmware reports a false capacity
typically the written lb a is roll over
in an F ILO fashion in this context F
ILO would be first in last overwritten
Allen continued to say that typically a
given flash storage device will be over
provisioned slightly to allow for cells
failing etc the way leveling algorithm
tries to quote lap the media regardless
of where the writes are addressed to
it's likely the scammers just turn these
configuration dials the opposite way
there's no real trickery at place since
the wear leveling is still doing its job
but has no choice but to overwrite valid
data
the host address is written becomes
greater than the available flash media
that's just my guess but it's likely
we're leveling would naturally allow for
such a scam the way it typically works
so it's configured in sort of a
backwards fashion and it comes down to a
modified firmware to what you would
typically see on these and depending on
the module you look at they do have part
numbers on them and we were able to look
them up they also some of them say 16 B
in the part number which seems to
correspond with the results where we saw
larger capacity but still less than 32
gigabytes maybe a 16 gigabyte module or
a microSD card as opposed to a 6 to 8
gigabyte one like the first one that we
tested so if you look around and look up
the part number you'll find some forums
there's one we saw with a Polish
retailer that was actually selling these
unwittingly and customers had purchased
them and ended up with obviously a
device worse than then advertiser
expected and it's not necessarily the
fault of the retailer but their supplier
and
this is something that can happen to you
on Amazon as well we've certainly seen
lots of these in Street markets all
around the world and so it's just it's a
matter of trying to look out for some
common signs like does the packaging
have a low-resolution
logo or does the SD card not look like
the common color and branding scheme
used by that manufacturer other than
that just test it when you get home and
by the way formatting the file system if
you on this one when we tried to format
from fat32 the NTFS windows just simply
didn't allow it it just didn't work so
that doesn't fix the problem either but
anyway it's a common scam it's something
we wanted you to be aware of because SD
cards as they become prevalent for well
more prevalent for things like phones
and mainstream everyday use and no
longer just used in digital photography
it's it's becoming a an increasingly
popular scam because more and more
people who are maybe not privy to it our
purchasing SD cards and this is also
common by the way for USB drives so do
keep an eye out for those as well but
they're not only more obvious because
when you go to eBay and you see a one
terabyte drive for four dollars there's
clearly a problem so that's it for this
one
also I should note be careful of
plugging in things like those one
terabyte drives into your computer it is
possible that some of them in addition
to being a scam have malware on them so
if you're going to test them perhaps
test them like if it's just for fun and
you know it's if they test them in a
system that you are okay with with
reformatting and and securing once
you're done because it it is possible
that they are vessels for malware but
these did not seem to be they were just
scams so that's it
that you're watching subscribe for more
thank you to the viewer who sent these
in we appreciate it
and we do have more of the viewers hunt
Hardware coming up because it's been
sitting around and we have some cool
ideas what to do with it so subscribe
