plumes of coal as it spun up to maximum
rpm a few weeks ago this time targeting
knocked to his fans after receiving a
few different requests to look into
manufacturing quality difference between
Noctua fans made in China and Taiwan we
managed to bring in a fair sample size
to measure linear feet per minute air
flowed through the radiator TVA output
PWM range and a couple of other things
we also got to see for ourselves that
the two fans have visible color
differences ranging from off Bay's to
weather worn off beige so today we're
looking at the differences between the
two sources of origin for the fans see
if they matter
before that this is brought to you by
EVGA s at CLC 280 liquid cooler for CPUs
which we've previously benchmarked and
found to be a high performer given its
relative silence the temperature output
learn more about this $140 cooler at the
link in the description below the
original reddit post that sparked all of
this came because a user ordered fans
from Knox WA a lot of them had seldom
came from Taiwan some came from China
and they're marked on the boxes made in
Taiwan or made in China if you look at
the fans there's a slight color
variation between them one of them is
actually as much as it's easy to joke
about is a slightly more off beige than
the other one so the China made fans
have darker blades the housing is a
slightly different color and in the
original post there were some concerns
over whether the cooling quality the
noise output quality we'll call it would
be the same between the two fans with
generally the expectation being in that
reddit thread that the Taiwan made fans
would be superior to their China made
counterparts so we spoke to Knox wa
about this a bit after we got some
initial testing done and this stack of
fans over here most of them are from the
original reddit poster who made the
threat on build a PC so we were able to
test those then this stack of fans is
about is probably 80% of my current
collection of bands between Noctua
directly buying them on eBay to make
sure we could get the right China or
Taiwan fan and then sourcing them
elsewhere so we have a decent sample
size I'll warn you now we got most the
way through testing them before I
basically said okay
this is enough data as you'll see
momentarily but so the thing is it looks
like this is an issue we're primarily on
the visible side we're looking at
pigment differences maybe differences in
where Noctua or their factory more
appropriately sourced the plastic or the
pigments or whatever they use to color
the fans be in different countries
different factories it's possible that
they didn't use exactly the same color
which if you're going to complain about
it that's a fine thing to complain about
perhaps not wish it I've noticed but
ultimately you're looking at color
matching this and trying to see
differences between them if you can sure
it's you know be careful when you're
buying them I suppose that's what it
comes down to now in terms of quality
differences that's where we come in so
we did anemometer testing for linear
feet per minute which we're calling F
p.m. here L p.m. if you'd prefer and
that was using a crackin X 42 radiator
as basically an airflow straightener but
it also just because it's a standard
type of object that you would use that
would create a need to have static
pressure performance so we use that and
then we're also looking at decibel
performance at 20 inches from the fan
and radiator combination and then we're
looking at PWM range at 100% down to 20%
where there's normal variance anyway
we'll talk about that more in a moment
the main fans we're looking at in this
content piece are going to be the NS a
14 the 140 millimeter static pressure
band and then we do have the n FF 12 the
120 millimeter ones but as you'll see
from the a 14 s they really kind of sum
things up and the a 14 in the original
reddit post did actually have more
visible differences than other marketing
aspects of the fan design then would be
present in the n FF 12 because they just
have fewer features on them so some of
those include what Knox would calls flow
acceleration or stepped Inlet designs
things like that these are typical
marketing names for small optimizations
made to a product that may or may not
improve performance there's really no
easy way to tell without getting an a/b
test going where you have one that's
just there what you're looking at more
is normally the motor in the
and only the fan blade design rather
than the housing where you're looking at
these tiny triangular indents on the
inside of the housing but to be fair
they do look a bit different between
Taiwan and China and so that comes down
to the mold so nice wood tells us that
they have a new mold that they made for
the China Factory they also told us when
I get this right that their fans have
more or less always come from both China
and Taiwan but that the same model is
rarely made in both locations at least
simultaneously so this recently changed
because Knox we need is a tool up to
meet demand and the injection mold twins
were made new at the China location we
were also told that the fans have
primarily been produced in China these
models over the last few years so it's
actually impossible right now for us to
get stock of the Taiwan fans from
Knoxville directly they don't have them
we have to find them elsewhere so if you
do end up with a fan from each location
you're probably buying stock that a
retailer has that for a little while
that's what it comes down to well it's
going to test in other ways more
information in the description in the
article below if you want to read about
the testing but we can blow through this
one pretty quickly because it's really
just a couple of fantast we are not
focusing on temperature testing because
there are a million variables and any
differences you see there are going to
be because of things like prime95
deciding to change its power cycling or
whatever software you're using doing
something different or what any amounts
of small things
what makes far more sense to do it as
the air flow which we're doing with an
anemometer and a hot wire so linear feet
per minutes or measurement through a
radiator ideally you have a static
pressure some something that would
benefit from static pressure off my
spend and then the other aspect is
decibels and we can look at PWM range
but temperatures don't really matter
because it follows that if your air flow
is the same then your temperature should
be the same with variables from the CPU
and the motherboard notwithstanding
let's first call PWM to set the stage
PWM town control varies from fan to fan
and fan manufacturing differences mean
that your top end and low end rpm is
going to change between units doesn't
matter if it's Noctua or someone else
the same is true for water pumps and is
true across the industry in general in
general PWM variants can be up to 15%
between fans so you really want to fix
the fan speeds of testing differences in
frames and blades and things like that
since otherwise just testing normal pwm
variance Noctua noted to us that pwm to
RPM response typically varies by one to
four percent in their products something
that we can validate with a tolerance of
ten percent in pwm range pretty standard
this means a few things one you need a
larger sample size of fans of test we
have a decent sample size but it is by
no means 100% conclusive we can draw
some pretty good conclusions from it
however and it also means that you
really want to fix those rpm if testing
it with pwm fan speed percentages the
numbers are going to be all over the
place it's not a reliable way to do
things and we'll start there anyway and
move on to testing that shows at a fixed
rpm we're also looking at PWM range to
see if the China mate or Taiwan made
fans are consistently lower or higher in
our p.m. here's a line plot showing rpm
on the vertical axis versus QAM signal
on the horizontal axis the fans are all
close to one another with normal
variances dictating the differences
averaged across all tested fans and pwm
ranges we found a difference of 2.5
percent in rpm to PWM response between
10 with no particular favor shown toward
China or Taiwan manufacturing note again
that we were limited by sample size to
about 8 fans tested so we can't make
sweeping statements that this will
always be true but with our sample size
which is a decent amount we can say that
it is true we see no significant
difference between region of origin with
these fans and again variance in PWM
signal its response is normal anyway
adjusting PWM speed by plus or minus 1%
will often allow rpms to match as we'll
do in a moment here's a look at a table
of just sones rpms at each PM range to
better illustrate the point numerically
this variance is normal between all fans
and is not a product of being made in
China versus Taiwan
continuing on with PWM points for a
minutes here's a chart showing noise
levels at the very end PWM ranges keep
in mind that fan rpm changes between
fans at each percentage at 100% PWM our
DBA range is forty two point eight to
forty three point six so a little bit
less than one DBA not noticeable and
more or less within our accuracy anyway
ninety percent post a range of forty
point six to forty 1.4 DB a eighty
percent is 38.2 to thirty nine point one
with no particular benefit on the China
or Taiwan made
and in general there's no pattern
forming that said one single fan from
the China manufacturing plant sent by
the reddit original poster did generally
perform about 1 DBA louder than the
quietest fan which is more than we can
say for most the others which were a bit
more consistent this continuous scaling
down and the fans get closer as we go
with our ability to test halting at
around the 27 28 DBA area let's fix the
RPM level to get a better idea of
performance manually setting fan speed
in BIOS to match 1400 RPM or 1000 RPM we
end up with the numbers on-screen now at
1,400 rpm every fan regardless of
country of origin is within fractions of
a decibel of 41 DBA the differences here
are imperceptible to the human ear you
would not be able to identify one to the
next and a blind test although we did
not produce a frequency spectrum plot we
did not notice significant differences
in fan frequency output from a
subjective standpoint at 1000 rpm every
fan is within plus or minus 0.5 DB a of
33 DBA making them again effectively
identical in noise levels we did not
subjectively notice differences in
frequency spread at this rpm either
moving on next to linear feet per minute
testing with an anemometer logging over
a period of several minutes using the X
42 radiator as a flow straightener and
then averaging the end of the results
strain here's a look at linear F p.m.
response to PWM signal again keep in
mind that PWM signal doesn't mean much
the fan RPMs are not the same so
performance is different as a result of
rpm changing not necessarily as a result
of the fan body manufacturing quality
look at that aspect next linear feet per
minute will be abbreviated as f PM for
this section f PM post a difference of
plus or minus 2% from 20% to 100% PWM
and 10% intervals with no favour shown
toward Taiwan or China maids and again
our difference here is Thames from PWM
to rpm response variance which is within
normal manufacturing parameters we're
averaging around 5:15 to 5:20 F p.m. at
100 percent duty cycle with a 14 fans
about 460 to 477 F p.m. at 90% and so on
down the line our results are fairly
tight and tied together at a fixed fan
speed of 1,400 rpm the numbers are
largely the same across the board the
only standout is the first Taiwan made
fan which technically blots 6fp
lower results an average of this rpm
well this is within our test margins
without extreme equipment we really
can't dig deeper than this and as far as
our testing is concerned these are all
effectively equal and will produce
indistinguishably different thermal
results given the proximity and fpm
differences and thermal testing would
stem more from variables in the CV test
than from fans just like normally at
1,000 rpm it's more of the same story
we're close enough in performance to
write this off as more or less equal
greater test resolution and controls
would be required to plot differences
reliably at which point you're exiting
what a user would ever reliably or
reasonably detect anyway so it's no
longer a scenario which is entirely
relevant to this matter
speaking regionally there's no pattern
between the two sources and all the fans
are more or less equal they are
functionally equivalent in performance
so we're not seeing any real difference
between the fans that we have we tested
all of these and most of these didn't
get to the NFF 12s because it just it
wasn't necessary and they were the
source of the concern anyway because
after we had all that data you're
basically looking at plus or minus 2% in
the most extreme cases and basically
zero when you match the RPM and this is
where it boils down to a couple of
comments about the internet and about
Knox with position Noctua has an
interesting challenge
they have positioned themselves as a
supremely accurate and high quality
company when it comes to fans
specifically and they are fighting their
own reputation here by having a small
bit of variance between more or less
color which probably triggered looking
into the other smaller aspects of the
fan and the housing design Knox was in a
position where these small changes are
perceived as probably a whole lot worse
than they actually are and that's
because it diverges so strongly from
their brand perception now does it
matter that these changes are these
differences are present not in
performance we couldn't find any in
noise levels our sample size although
pretty damn good is obviously not
representative of the whole so it's
possible if they're bad bad bands out
there one of the china-made fans did
have about 1 DBA consistently higher
output than the
other fans so there's going to be
variants there will always be that
one-off product that just didn't come
off the line quite right but we're not
really seeing a lot of that here so
they're fighting their own reputation is
what it comes down to and then as far as
the original reddit thread it was great
that the original user noticed those
differences is great as always to report
those differences like the user did and
make the thread to bring awareness the
problem get people who have the means
the test of stuff to actually try and
test it and see if there's a problem
that's all good what I would like to see
more caution around is maybe the
relating the reply comments below it
where people immediately jump on the
boycott bandwagon or the oh my god I
can't believe they did this they're
outsourcing the China bandwagon when we
really need a much more level head to
look at this kind of stuff because a lot
of the time the answer is they just
switched factories if I switched molds
and that happens every day
you probably don't notice it normally
not to what it got noticed and for that
they have at least briefly been punished
but we don't see a reason for them to
need that punishment so from what we've
seen here not a big difference if
someone else happens to find bans that
between China and Taiwan do show major
differences please let us know tweeted
us at gamers Nexus make sure you check
your PWM signal to two-hour p.m.
response to make sure that you're not
just actually measuring differences
between PWM speeds because that's pretty
common so if you've equalized your rpms
you should be able to get decent pass
between the two feel free to let us know
if you find a significant difference if
you do we can revisit but again
everything we've seen here it looks like
not a big deal
perhaps you could bop Noctua on the nose
for changing their color they have told
us that they're looking into that and
hoping to get things more standardized
normal off page instead of off page and
slightly more off page in the future I
don't think they use those exact words
to describe their colors but you get
what I'm saying so thank you for
watching as always you get a paycheck
