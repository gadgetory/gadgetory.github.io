some sort of mid tower with a power
supply shroud entering the market and
that's been true for a while now so I'd
still argue that NZXT sort of
revitalized this trend with the H 440
and then the s 340 which is the smaller
version of the H 440 but that trend has
been continued this year especially with
Corsair there 400 CEO chief reviewed the
fan tax Eclipse P 400 reviewed didn't
quite like it but it is the product that
exists and now we're looking at the
Roseville gun near and soon after this
will likely be looking at the
Silverstone R l05 B all of these cases I
just named have a very similar design
approach and that's a mid Tower
most of them without a five and a
quarter Bay though this one does have a
five and a quarter Bay and power supply
shrouds that is the overarching trend
for the current iteration of mid tower
cases on market the market stack up is
pretty tightly packed to the s 340 is
available between 60 and 70 dollars
Corsairs 400 C is around ninety to a
hundred dollars and the fantex P 400
ranges from sixty to ninety dollars
depending on how many options you want
to add rosewall's new gun near case the
one we're looking at today is priced at
65 currently available through Newegg
which is its parent company and despite
being sort of a store brand of Newegg
Rosewell has put out legitimately good
cases over the past few years the
Rosewell r5 for instance was one of our
favorite budget mid towers of its time
the new gun near case is clearly taking
a stab at the current metagame of mid
towers in the market made obvious by its
power supply shroud it's somewhat
compact form factor and lack of main
compartment hard drive cages the
governor does straight from its
competition slightly by adding five and
a quarter inch Bay's potentially giving
it a stand out point in the market but
Silverstone's our l0 v will soon compete
with the same feature set and a
marginally lower price so Roseville's
got a limited window here to get their
gun deer out there it's definitely a
tough market and the 5.25 engine bay is
really won't be enough to make it stand
out especially not in the US where
there's sort of an ongoing move away
from internal optical drives as you all
know but let's walk through the rest of
the case and see if it stands out in any
other noteworthy ways starting outside
the rows wells
near uses three different colors of
black paint definitely an oversight on
their part they've got one type on this
top metal panel one type of black pants
on the plastic panel also on the top and
one type on the front of the plastic
panel that's glossy so three different
completely different colors you can
actually see the difference pretty well
in the correct lighting scenarios and
then they've got a red accents going
around the outside with the sort of
weird thing on the front the design
whatever that is so they've got this
mixed kind of confusing aesthetic going
on with the new gun near case and the
black pant is a problem that we've we've
seen with white paint and with black
paint both of them in particular with
manufacturers who alternate between
plastic and metal panels as this does
here and that alternation does mean that
the the tone of the black or the white
will change between plastic and metal
and so they have to account for that in
the design process when selecting
different paints and that's not really
to mention its front facing design I'm
not quite sure what the extruded plastic
is supposed to resemble but it looks
kind of like someone took the pen tool
in Photoshop and tried to learn how to
use it had Rosel gone for a more edgy
look or more curved look it makes sense
as an attempt to maybe appeal to a
certain market like the younger crowd of
system builders who kind of like that
more standout look like the Wolfe alloy
has which might not appeal to all of us
but certainly does have a segment with
the way the gun near did it though it
just kind of looks tasteless and oddly
mixed between an attempt at Grace and
attempt at edginess I will give credit
where it's due though the front panel
has marginally more airflow potential
then the fans XP 400 which isn't saying
a whole lot because the p4 hunt is
pretty bad but the Roseville gunner is
at least grilled on the left side and
that's reasonable it's grilled a little
bit on the right side there the plastics
a bit too thick to be realistically
useful in most cases and the company
could further improve on this by
reducing the thickness of its plastic
bars substantially on both the left and
the right and the top panel could also
use some improvements but it does
deserve credit for its magnetic dust
filter which is somewhat of a hot trend
right now between Corsair and all the
other manufacturers fantex included and
that is something that I do like about
the ROS
going near time to look at the inside of
the case the Roseville gun near differs
a little bit from other cases in its
class but overall it's pretty comparable
to the existing models out there from
other manufacturers like the s 340 and
the fans XP 400 and again the Corsair
400 C the PSU shroud takes an industrial
approach to its design complete with a
random screw in the middle of nowhere to
hold the underside cage in place the
shroud stops just short of full coverage
of the bottom third of the case this is
to theoretically allow enough clearance
for the two front fans or a radiator
maybe but we think Roswell could have
executed it in a much cleaner fashion
for example had rosa lacks the five and
a quarter drives the shroud could fully
extend and the fans could actually move
upward which would improve the cooling
performance definitely and would also
allow for a more full side panel window
which is it's it's just short of looking
cool it kind of I don't like really the
way the the side panel window truncates
itself right now we've actually got
plans to sort of fix the gun near in a
future video but that's still
forthcoming in the meantime a couple
other points of improvement the shroud
suffers from the same clearance issues
that the fans xp for 100 did it's got
issues fitting some PS use into the rear
panel and they have to be installed with
great patience and at a slight angle to
avoid scraping the paint off the PSU in
some spots and that's applicable with
the larger PSU certainly but there's
still ATX form factor and Rose will spec
she definitely lists ATX form factor PSU
has supported and then there's the
matter of cabling so while we're back
here in the power supply area looking at
the cabling Rosewall has taken a unique
approach to cabling that could actually
be cool but it's poorly executed and
they get routed through the backside of
the tray which is fairly standard but
instead of feeding through holes in the
motherboard tray they feed out of a side
panel wall and that's doubling an
interesting approach it could work out
brilliantly with motherboards that have
a right-angle 24 pin header
unfortunately Rosewell doesn't offer
enough clearance so overlapping cables
are severe inhibitor to the side panels
ability to close Rosewell needs about 10
millimetres of extra clearance here has
a minimum to help out it's also too
tight to make changes once the PSU is in
there so if you want to add a cable
later the whole thing has to come out
and really best just to get all the
cables pre-installed and prieur outed
for future upgrades now a couple of good
points here there is a fan hub on the
rear side of the tray
that's definitely something I like
there's a 3-speed fan control on the top
of the front panel
but unfortunately the front panel the
way it's attached to the chassis it's
actually got the PCB for all the front
i/o attached to the plastic front panel
and that means that when you pull it out
it's got the cables attached so there's
not a good way to separate everything
and that is an old approach to the
design that I'm really surprised - still
being used normally what modern cases do
is they'll have those USB and i/o
cutouts in the top panel and then just
mount that to the chassis the frame
itself and that allows you to remove
both the top and the front panel without
having the cabling and the PCB attached
which is of course a bit hazardous to
the the cables and things like that the
other thing that Rosewell did actually
do a bit well was the top of the power
supply shroud has a cutout for the PCIe
cables something that I like a lot and
that allows direct management of PCIe
cables unfortunately it also is there as
a means to sort of mitigate the lack of
pass-throughs in the bottom of the
motherboard tray so you can't really
pass through the front i/o out the the
underside of the tray into the correct
pin outs on the motherboard in a
concealed fashion and that's because
there are no cutouts there for it so if
you got to route them either through the
middle of the case where they're very
visible or if they're long enough you
can try and force it through the power
supply shroud to get to your motherboard
from there as we recently showed in our
thermal chamber validation our thermal
tests are almost perfectly accurate when
it comes to PC hardware in cases and
test methodology is described in the
article linked below if you want to
learn more about that the Gagnier
performed marginally better than the P
400 in both CPU and GPU peak thermal
performance charts and the governor sits
at forty two point 401 Celsius at load
for the CPU and fifty eight point seven
seven Celsius load for the GPU thermals
if Rosewell modified the front panels
are suggestions we're pretty confident
that the temperatures would plants the
case definitely ahead of the s3 forty
and potentially even the 400 C but then
you're basically redesigning the front
of the case so definitely not a great
measurement of the thermal success the
case has a few good ideas but none of
them are really developed properly or to
their full potential and that's
definitely disappointing in terms of the
cases viability on market
right now they've got a few problems
with the design the paint colors are
mismatched which is really just plainly
an oversight and then the front panel I
really don't know what's going on there
if you like it then great
that's all subjective but I do not so a
front panel the paint colors are
somewhat problematic more problematic
though is that the interior is actually
difficult to build with and that is in
spite of the power supply shroud which
should make it easier especially with
cabling the cabling is not at all easy
and closing the backside panel or the
right side panel is somewhat difficult
with the way that the cables end up
stacking on top of each other and the
fact that there's really no clearance
there at all or any kind of cutout or
stamp out on the side panel to allow
that extra space for cabling the end
conclusion here is that really I could
waffle between the few good things that
were done right and the things that were
done wrong with the case and find a
middle ground but in this instance I
will plainly just say that I would not
buy this case the competition is far too
good on the market the s340 is very
similarly priced if you really need
optical drives the forthcoming two are
l05 from silverstone is a bit better
design that we haven't fully officially
reviewed it yet and that does have the
optical drives if you don't need them
the s340 is a p400 even and the 400cc
are better options than the 400 see to
be fair is a bit more expensive so maybe
if it drops to $50 I would consider it
as a purchase because that market is a
bit easier to get into with this kind of
quality but there's still fierce
competition there between coarser and
Silverstone alike at the 40 to $50 price
range if anyone from Rosewell is
watching this video I would encourage
you to look through the archives I'm
looking at the r5 because that was a
case that rose well actually did really
well they were ahead of their time with
the r5 the pull out dust filters were
really nicely actuated and that the
mechanics of the case were just much
better than anything in this case so
that is where I would start for
improving design this case however I'd
say is a miss and probably move on to
something a bit better at the mid tower
market segment so that is all for this
