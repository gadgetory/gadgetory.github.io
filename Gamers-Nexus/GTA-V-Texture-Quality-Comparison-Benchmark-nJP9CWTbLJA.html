we're looking at a texture comparison
from grand theft auto 5 this is an
article I wrote and published the other
day if you're interested in this the
article is linked in the description
below so I when it's the GTA 5 and I
tested out the three separate settings
for texture resolution there's normal
high and very high and that's it the
biggest impact that these make is
generally going to be in the vram side
and I've got a chart here that shows RAM
consumption based on which setting
you're using and it is a delta over
normal so normal is zero we basically we
null out the other settings because
texture resolution has an identical
impact across all resolutions and
settings so normal is effectively zero
that means it's your baseline and then
high is an added seven hundred ninety
six megabytes consumed and very high as
an added 891 so the difference between
high and very high is pretty small it's
about 100 megabytes for vram consumption
so here's a couple of screenshots
showing the texture differences and I've
got fork these were taken in 4k and I
did not scale down anything in the
article this is all explained in the
video we've got a scale for the 1080
u-tube limit so that is an obvious issue
here but you can still see the
differences and the bump map is
enumerated a little bit differently
depending on the lighting that's
something I couldn't really control for
that well but you can still see how huge
difference very high has over high
especially in the dumpster screenshot
which is what you're looking at now with
the hobo tag on the dumpster and I just
very high and high alone have a big
difference then normal is a huge
difference but it makes it perform on
pretty much everything it really helps a
lot with performance on on vram limited
devices and i gps and then we've got
benchmarks so here is where you can see
the performance difference for all the
settings at 1080p with a 270 X and at 4k
with a titin X as you can see
effectively there is zero difference
this is all within margin of error what
half PS is not is not something that's
outside of margin of error so that is so
of the quick test we did on texture
resolution impact in gta5 huge visual
difference and very little FPS
difference obviously vram consumption is
a concern if you're on a one gigabyte
device or an IG P but if you're using
anything larger than that I would say
just push for very high even if you have
to force the ignore suggestions option
because it's really not worth
sacrificing the fidelity of very high
for an extra hundred megabytes of VRAM
you're probably not going to notice even
if you have to ignore the suggested
limits because the suggested limit is
for maximum peak vram consumption not
the average or normal the RAM
consumption and to that end it means
that you're very rarely actually going
to be hitting that number and when you
do it might be a little bit of tearing
but that's about it so that is all for
