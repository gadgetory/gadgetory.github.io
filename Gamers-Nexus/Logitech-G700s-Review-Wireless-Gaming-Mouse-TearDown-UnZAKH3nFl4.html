Nexus dotnet and today we're looking at
logitech's new G 700 s high-end gaming
mouse which is a pretty crazy addition
to the already high-end logitech arsenal
and I had the chance to completely
dismantle the mouse and explore its
hardware and obviously was able to game
quite a bit on it as well with rift and
shoot mania so this review will act sort
of as a summarized version of the full
article that's linked in the description
below and as always let's talk about
specs and then get to the hands-on and
opinions the G 700 s is a wireless
rechargeable mouse with wired
capabilities via standard micro USB
connection but it does ship with a
special cable that's molded to fit the
mouse more stylish Li you can use
basically any micro USB connection
though the the mouse has 13 buttons LMB
rmb Mme
and then the additional buttons which
are four on the left the left side near
the thumb position three in the index
finger position near the left mouse
button and then the wheel will do a
left-right tilt as well as the normal
middle mouse click and also some other
cool stuff we'll talk about in a second
and then there are two buttons south of
the wheel which can be used to toggle
the free spin on the wheel or the second
one will just basically do whatever you
want it to do and on that note the the
free spinning wheel note the hyper fast
micro gear precision wheel is what
Logitech uses and that is just a bunch
of fancy words to basically say they use
a ratcheted hub that allows it to either
free spin or scroll normally with the
normal ratcheted motion so it makes it
ideal for users who spend a lot of time
scrolling through large documents or
spreadsheets you can just hit the button
toggle it into free spin mode and then
spin it really fast and stop it when you
want to stop scrolling so that is pretty
sweet
other than buttons the mouse uses and
Avago a DNS 9800 series sensor with a
202 8200 dpi range and using Logitech's
drivers that I will explain in a
separate video also linked below
you can configure several dpi profiles
and then cycle through them you
using a mouse button so pretty good
control there you are able to configure
it for basically any game you want if
you want like a sniper mode you can do
that the same or similar sensor sensors
are used in the genius hila which I
reviewed and the Logitech g600 mouse
which Patrick Lathan reviewed and it's
definitely been around the block and
performs fairly well it is a note
well-known sensor it does everything
that we needed to do as gamers and while
we're talking about internals you can
see in my teardown that the G 700 s uses
higher endurance metal switches rather
than the cheaper plastic Team X switches
that we're used to seeing in mice and
this is spoken for in Logitech's testing
where they target a 20 million click
lifespan for the mouse or for the
buttons on the mouse and that's actually
so high that generally the plastic
buttons will fail long before the
switches we were told that PAX East by
Logitech and I have to say that the on
the button front the G 700 uses or G 700
s uses better buttons significantly
better buttons than previous Logitech
mice I've used and the G 400 is kind of
it's been known to have issues with the
mouse 4-5 buttons I think it has both
those failing this that seems to be
solved and the G 700 s which is
obviously much higher end than that one
ever was anyway still I wasn't too happy
with the actuation of the three index
position buttons near the left Mouse but
it wasn't anything detrimental to the
overall unit I just think they could be
a little more fluid they are positioned
very well though and they are sort of
flared up in a way that makes sure you
never push the wrong one as for my
opinions I found that the grip and
overall feel of the mouse was easily its
biggest advantage over the other
peripherals in this very competitive
Mouse market and the feel is almost
almost perfect the rounded chassis
design is much more comfortable than
some of the more boxy bodies out there
like the Gila and the buttons are all
within reach and don't require any
awkward flexing to use like the G 600
did and the grip is
stron and and very easy to control with
high DPI so as far as grip and
ergonomics I think this is probably the
best mouse I've ever used in that regard
and if you know if price were in an
issue I would tell everyone to go buy it
just for that reason alone the mouse has
a win extruding from the from below the
thumb position so you're able to rest
your thumb comfortably and still reach
those four buttons easily and that just
helps strengthen the grip that much more
and and also reduces strain on your
thumb so it's one of the best design
device I've ever used as I said in terms
of pure economics and the rubberized
hydrophobic excuse me materials and no
finger prints paint just help to firm up
the grip even further and it's just it's
obvious that there's a lot of quality
materials in this mouse I did have
trouble moving the mouse smoothly with
the cable attached which tended to be
poorly positioned and dragged along the
mousing surface more than the braided
cables would that are found on most
other mice including the G 500s and I've
always favored Wired over wireless but
this mouse sort of forces the other way
around since the wires positioning is
suboptimal and produces a drag that
hinders competitive play and twitch
shooters and luckily I did test the
mouse battery on the maximum gaming
so-called mode and it lasted
approximately 18 hours of mixed gaming
and everyday use in testing as described
in the article and that is including the
micro sleep states it enters when you're
not using the mouse for you know 30
seconds to a minute at a time if there's
that much time you're not using it it
enters a mic sleep state and conserves
power and with all that noted the
Logitech G Series software does seem a
lot more buggy with the G 700s than
other mice and I think that's because
the battery it's a bit of a negative I
had issues with crashing and sporadic
unresponsiveness when toggling power to
the mouse or changing mouse functions
mouse button functions but once the
mouse was configured it's not really
that big of a deal because you generally
never look at the software again after
initial configuration so not a huge
negative
the software has historically been
fairly solid so I do imagine it's just a
matter of patching it and at the end of
the day the mouse uses high-quality
internals it has a proven sensor it has
fantastic grip and overall feel and has
buttons that are actually within usable
range so it is expensive at 80 to 100
dollars but if you want one of the best
wireless mice out there for gaming or
have specific needs for wrist or tendon
problems then this is absolutely worth
looking at more carefully and if you can
get a hands on at a store I recommend it
for users who prefer to spend less
consider looking at the G 500s for
reviewing right now or the genius HeLa
though I'd personally favor the 500s for
its superior grip and with that I will
lucky let you check out the full review
linked in the description below and the
software video and I will see you all
next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
