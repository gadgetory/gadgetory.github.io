ge62 laptop i wanted to show a quick
video on how to update bios and the ec
or embedded controller and we're doing
that because based on our thermal
readings here we're actually seeing some
pretty high thermals on this very
specific section of the laptop so if I
measure it right now at idle right
almost 40 Celsius and once it's under a
tiny bit of load maybe 20% CPU load
we're getting something close to a
Fahrenheit be a bit over 100 degrees
Fahrenheit pretty warm very
uncomfortable and diagnosing that it
seems to be an issue with the fan speed
or the fan curve in BIOS and MSI have
sent us a patch to fix that so I'm going
to show you how to install that so first
of all you download for whatever laptop
you're using you download the relevant
patches and that's going to be an EC
patch or embedded controller end of BIOS
one and we've got those two folders here
and so this is one of them we apply this
update through the OS so we can do this
through Windows just by double clicking
on the correct utility and we've got AC
flash and EC bet I'm going to try out
you see that that's going to ask us some
questions so type Y to start flashing
the embedded controller let's do that
and then that'll start running the next
step is to update BIOS so we can already
hear the fan starting to freak out a
little bit but when we update BIOS will
actually just shut down boot into BIOS
and then load the ROM from the USB key
that's already plugged in here so to do
that step you download the BIOS ROM for
whatever your laptop is load it onto a
USB key it does yikes
I don't know if you can hear that
through the mic but I guess some it's
working so fans are freaking out right
now
we're going to let this boot up make
sure it's okay and then when we get into
BIOS we'll basically load the rom from
the USB key it does not need to be a
bootable key is all I was trying to say
before the fans interrupted me so give
this a second and then and then you'll
see the next part once we get through
this ec update
okay okay so now we're going to update
the BIOS the EC was correctly updated
even though the fans are freaking out so
they should all have a better fan
control now with the BIOS update
included first thing to do is once
you're in here obviously hit delete to
get in here before booting into Windows
and the system information tab will have
the EC version right here and the BIOS
version you basically just check that
number against whatever's on the laptop
manufacturers website if it yours is
older than it might need an update our
EC version was dot 103 before now it is
dot 105 so it has definitely been
updated and now we're going to go to the
Advanced tab and go down to the UEFI
BIOS update section and this should be
the same for any american megatrends
bios basically so we hit enter here UEFI
BIOS update gives us a bunch of options
these are all just different identifiers
for device paths the one we want is this
USB device that is the s the USB Drive I
have plugged in right now and we're
going to go down into the ROM file that
I've got the top level and then and then
apply that and that will update your
BIOS from that point you let it let it
go let it shut down cycle power and you
should be good to go hopefully with
better fan speeds and better thermals so
that is a quick fix to fan thermals on
these newer laptops if you are having
problems where the fans are running high
enough and so the CPUs overheating
there's a million other things it could
be as well but leave a comment below
we'll try to help you out or hopefully
someone else will with some suggestions
thank you for watching if you like this
type of coverage as always hit the
patreon link the postal video and I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
