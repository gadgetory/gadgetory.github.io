that is almost as rare as good case
reviews its average not worth buying why
this is the red devil power color rx
Vegas 64 card so this is the second of
the partner cards that we've gotten the
first is the Strix which is still not
out this isn't out yet either but the
fact that it came in should hopefully be
indicative of a wave of incoming Vega
partner cards we will see for the
meantime we can tear it down look at the
internals a bit and then hopefully it'll
come to market but either way we've got
one to work on for now before we get
into that this content is brought to you
by the Thermaltake flow RGB closed-loop
liquid cooler which is a 360 millimeter
radiator plus 3 120 fans that are RGB
illuminated if then we'll take it ringg
fans at that this is a 4.5 done a stack
pump which is one of the faster pumps
you can learn more at the link in the
description below so starting out with
the basics this is a three fan cooler
obviously and those fans are how big
these are about 85 millimeter fans and
around them we have I think this is a
this red as a plastic so it's just a
plastic faceplate with what feels like a
metal sort of shroud around that back
side we have the back plate which is
aluminum and then it looks like it's all
Phillips heads so I'm not seeing
anything except for Phillips heads for
this teardown which will make it easy
this is a 2.5 slot card so it's one of
the larger ones and then for your i/o
you've got 2 DisplayPort to HDMI and
also 2 8 pins for the power connectors
which are inset ever-so-slightly it
looks like into the card except the
cooler protrudes past the PCB quite a
bit so it is one of the larger cards
that we've worked with lately this isn't
big enough to measure it so I won't
bother let's start with the teardown
this is mostly gonna be Phillips heads
on the back side the way this assembles
is you can see the red
the red support beams here so these red
beams are feeding through the screws
going through the back plate total more
over here and then this middle one does
not this connect to the cooler in the
middle so there's only one screw that's
not connected directly to the base plate
this is also connected directly into the
heatsink so the two spring-loaded screws
go into that another one three there
might be more still under the back plate
yep so that back plate did have to
separate and now we got a disconnect the
fans I'm just probably going to LEDs
wait what oh no where's the contact on
the HBM that is very bad okay so a turn
of events
we have a video where we tested limited
contact on HBM caused by different
mounting or a different height than the
GPU is that what's going on here because
there would be thermal paste
residue on the HBM you actually see a
little bit of it in the corner I didn't
touch that that's yeah you can see it
here too there's a very slight indent
right there that shows the contact the
limited contact to the HBM so what forty
micrometers so the question is is that
the height difference of the GPU and the
HBM
how can we show this on camera the best
hey everyone we are pausing the teardown
for a second so this is about a week
later now the time that I'm doing this
voiceover we spoke with power color
after the tear down immediately and
brought the thermal paste lack of
contact to their attention and they had
a pretty quick response so fortunately
the unit they sent us was pre-production
which meant that they were able to
according to them make changes in time
for production so power color made the
changes as they told me they sent an
image of them taking apart the new card
off the line and the mass production
cards should have the throne face
contact you're seen here they basically
solved for the problem by putting a
whole lot more on there which is fine
because the access will just squish out
and then the gap will hopefully be
filled so that should solve some of the
concern that we had initially and a
definitely good job by power color for
catching it in time or for listening to
us catching it in time to make a change
so we'll see hopefully it comes out the
way they've said for the production
models but it looks like problem has
been solved at this point
oh and just before anyone asks yes we
tested this before the teardown so in
our review when it comes out we'll have
numbers for the pre thermal paste fixed
version and the post their own paste
fixed version so you can see what the
actual differences in HBM temperatures
will be kind of cool and that review is
coming soon not 100% sure yet we're
waiting on drivers but shouldn't be too
long at this point so this explains a
few things in terms of the height
difference and the thermals with some of
the earlier reports Vega it was noted by
Tom's hardware that the HBM height could
potentially be different from the GPU
height now we actually did some contact
pressure paper testing of this that will
be visible in a separate video that
already went live by the time this went
up but just to kind of recap this for
anyone who missed that content the very
short of it is that with this is a
recessed package so with a recessed
package you would expect coverage
something like this or like this this is
also recessed this is the strict
so the Strix has the same package type
as this power color card as opposed to
raised which would be this one where you
can see the foal like you can't even
really make out the HBM versus the GPU
because the inner poseur has an epoxy
resin layer on top of it that comes up
and meets the surface of the cooler so
it looks like there's full coverage with
the recessed packages although there's
not much of a thermal difference
normally you can see a difference in the
contact area but what you always see and
this is without thermal paste by the way
so big difference here these ones do not
have they're all pasted on them but when
you apply thermal paste to them it does
make contact to the HBM that's what
thermal paste is ultimately forged to
fill in these gaps and what we don't see
on the power color one is it is a card
with thermal paste applied on like those
pressure tests we did and yet you don't
see anything all paste on the HBM so
what this says to me is that this is an
issue of the HBM being lower than the
GPU on the package and this meter this
feeler gauge which was recommended by a
reader is 0.0 well roughly zero for zero
point zero three eight millimeters thick
the difference in GPU package two HBM
height as reported earlier was 40
micrometers so this is basically 40
micrometers so that explains quite a few
things and thermally is is is why things
are not you're going to be so good when
you look at the charts for this card
versus the others but anyway that's
that's problem we'll have to explore
further when you see the other content
but as for now let's go over the rest of
this this is a recessed package as
stated power color has no selection
choice over this and he kind of sells
them as they come in and it's just
distributed evenly so what we have
here's a doubled 12 face or something
like that
anyway HBM phase down here watch our
reference PCB teardown for more on this
and they've sized up the PCB so it is a
bit different and they've sized it up to
accommodate that larger cooler three
BIOS or another switch over here
alright so other stuff here giant giant
horrible thermal pad on this side if you
ever see if they're all pads of this
thick it's not a good thing
that's just more insulating layer for
the heat to try and get through when it
gets into the the heatsink so that's bad
okay so why do these channels exist this
these mill the channels that is to
accommodate capacitor so raised these
are raised or look I guess protruding
blocks you can see coming out down here
with thermal pads on top of them that
sinks it into the heatsink at least they
didn't make the throw up had that entire
thickness that's an upside this is our
MOSFET contact where you have the high
side and the low side FETs you see the
large and the small MOSFETs those are
highside and low-side they are exposed
copper MOSFETs so they actually cool
extremely well and they're heat
transfers a lot more readily into these
heat sinks than some of the other
MOSFETs we look at here's where you can
see the clear disconnect between the HBM
and the cold plate the cold plate is
actually raised up so now the question
becomes is this power colors fault or
and these fault who do you blame I'm
just using this as a gauge right now the
plate is the same height across the
whole thing
so the plates the same raised height so
then the question is is it am these
fault for having HBM that's lower than
the GPU or is it power colors fault for
not accounting for that I think that's
that's kind of what we need to come to a
and I'm sure they would each point the
finger at the other one so yeah well I
mean that's very revealing what we saw
here it I think I I am so hung up on
this that I don't even really know what
else to talk about because this baffles
me how much of an oversight that is by
somebody heat pipes so cold plate for
direct ish contact we have one two three
four five pipes without six six pipes
for actually direct well it's not that
direct but sort of inset we have one two
three four pipes that are inset into the
metal that have sort of in direct
contact with the cold plate I say
indirect because it's raised and they're
not going straight through that area
this pipe primarily goes through the top
part of the L shape of the vrm and this
one goes through where the chokes are so
you can see some chokes right here and
you can see the other side of the V R mm
the L shape the capacitor bank is
actually not cooled it's in here
underneath the heat pipes with no direct
contact anything it doesn't really need
to be cooled though to be fair
so yeah the L shape gives us an ideal
vrm it reduces the propagation delays
because everything's closer to the GPU
and the HBM so that's a good thing that
Andy did as for this
this is where's our C okay so this
contacts or this this is where the pin
outs are that's why that dents in there
and otherwise just a large heatsink and
air cooler yep
just just a big heat sink that's all
three fans pre connected to one wire so
that's nice at least some bumpers here
just to prevent warping from the
heatsink and then
okay together this is so so bad
some bumpers not thermal pads just
bumpers controller which is controller
is an IR 35 to 17 so that would be the
same one as used on the a.m. the
reference card the IR thirty five to
seventeen and again you can watch our
reference PCB tear down by builds I'd
for info on that I mean there's nothing
that's really it
oh that's interesting I wonder if this
has to do with the GPU unmolded G two
nine five two with actually a pencil
mark on it
this is unmolding this one is not erased
epoxy resin like interposer cover it's
on molded so it looks like they've at
least flagged that presumably that would
mean they're doing so I mean if you're
gonna flag it it's normally because
you're trying to do something about it
so I would assume that would mean
another heatsink that makes contact but
I guess that is not the case so yeah
that's all for this one really if
