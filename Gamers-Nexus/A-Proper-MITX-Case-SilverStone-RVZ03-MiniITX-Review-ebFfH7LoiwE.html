of the truest to form small form-factor
cases on the market sizing it at just 14
liters and filling a size category that
competes with gaming consoles the RBZ
0-3 is an enthusiasts mini ITX chassis
packing as much into as tiny of a box as
possible it also happens to be one of
the most ventilated ITX cases we've
looked at lately and does so while
sticking to a properly small form-factor
the question is whether or not it's
worth a buy and how restricting it might
be for builds before that this video is
brought to you by the EVGA CLC 280
liquid cooler people ask me how I keep
cool during the summer with all this
hair well I've tried a lot of different
products and if you do exactly what I
need many of them cause tangles or worse
EVGA CLC 280 helps keep my core
temperatures low they're in hot
benchmarking sessions the CLC 280 is
price competitive and focuses on
performance for value offering a 280
liquid cooler at an affordable price get
yours at the link in the description
below hair mounting kit sold separately
this is the silverstone rvz 0-3 it's a
thin almost console like enclosure very
portable lightweight and it could be
stood up either as you saw it or laid on
its side obviously this case has had
several improvements over Silverstone's
past small form-factor rvz cases
including the r VZ 0 1 - e specifically
- II for this one which we didn't review
but we saw it previously when it was
brand new and we also saw the RBZ 0 - at
CES 2015 the updates overall include
some features that you might not approve
of like removal of a slim optical drive
so from an HT VC standpoint you do lose
some of that versatility of having a
slim obstacle drive in there you'll
still have to get an external optical
drive if you want to play any kind of
blu-ray media or anything like that but
from an internal standpoint removing
that drive and actually a couple of the
other changes they made like to the
acrylic means that the GPU is more or
less completely compartmentalized from
the rest of the case and it's a great
thing because what happens is this case
now has
to 120-millimeter fan mounts here right
in front of the video card and those
helped tremendously in cooling it also
comes with two 120-millimeter fans and
they are slim fans too so you do get
enough clearance in there to fit pretty
much any card that will fit into slots
which is all this supports anyway and
then there's also breathing the area
down here and then there's a fan mount
back on this side so the case is very
well thought-out for how small it is the
biggest challenge with these ITX cases
is you've got ITX intent of two
categories you have like the NZXT h 200
series i TX wear or the Manta wear it's
basically just a really small ATX box
it's hardly small form-factor because
those cases are large enough to fit
small Tower coolers they can fit all
kinds of CLC is most of the time the
Corsair - ATX as an example of a micro
ATX case is about the same size as some
of the larger mini ITX cases and this is
the opposite side of things it's
properly small form factor so it's
targeted at a different market something
like this fits better with our test
bench then things like the 280 axed with
H 200 because you just can't fit a
bigger CPU cooler in here and so that
puts a lot more on the case company to
design properly and really work well
with the space that they have because
this is roughly the size of something
like an Xbox or a DVR there's not a lot
of space in there and again that comes
down to case engineering and design make
sure you have enough room for cables
where you can and air flow options where
you can and in this case they've
included to 120 fans which actually do a
great job as you'll see in our thermal
testing section and they've managed to
do it by just using slim fans
silverstone being a manufacturer of fans
they have the ability to get a bit more
custom than some of their competitors so
the case overall is built as a further
evolution it's about 90 to 115 dollars
depending on where you buy it typically
ninety five dollars to the black version
and it is meant to be a truly small
form-factor chassis that does mean that
it's going to have some interesting
thermal characteristics which we'll get
through
entirely on the front of the case the
ubiquitous v's on the front our clear
plastic backlit with RGB LEDs that are
hooked up to a controller and the
controller can accept input from a
standard four pin RGB header and
includes adaptors to control the normal
LED strips as well if you wanted those
let's go through Patrick's build notes
on assembly and the build quality of the
case assembly wasn't too demanding
overall but installing the graphics card
was the most elaborate part of the
process as with the RV's easier to
Silverstone provides a plastic shell
that houses SSDs GPUs and a rigid PCIe
riser part of this shell is an
adjustable plastic clamp to hold the GPU
firmly in place but we had difficulty
finding a spot where it wouldn't
interfere with the fan on our card every
GPU is different and cooler design and
it's hard to account for every possible
variation the clamp isn't strictly
necessary but it seems like a good idea
in a case with such tight tolerances so
we dragged it into place with a scrap
piece of plastic once the whole frame
was assembled it actually made
installation easier just plug in the
power cables and slot the whole thing
down onto the motherboard without having
to reach inside the case with a
screwdriver there is technically space
for an ATX power supply but given a
limited space for cable management SFX
is a better choice the maximum supported
power supply depth is 150 millimeters
but silverstone recommends a modular PSU
that's 140 or less our NR max power
supply is only 100 millimeters long and
that was definitely a good thing
choosing a small graphics card also
allows some extra space but it's
separated from the PSU and it's hard to
take advantage of to 120 millimeter fans
with space for a third is lavish for an
ITX case of this size and the stock fans
are placed directly over the CPU and GPU
for maximum efficacy or they would be if
our GPU were longer airflow is an
entirely positive pressure even the
vents that don't contain fans are over
GPU and power supply in takes all
exhaust is vented out the back of the
case through some holes beside the i/o
and there are three filters that ship
with the case one for each 120mm fan
mounts the filter material is an
extremely breathable fine mesh closer to
a fabric
and the frames are magnetic so they're
intended for use on the outside of the
case and are relatively easy to clean if
they're placed on the inside of the case
between the fan and the side panel the
fabric scrapes against the fan blades
and is problematic so Pacific kid on the
outside for this one in addition to the
usual tests we did a test pass with
filters applied but only two of them for
the two 120mm fans just to see if they
create enough impedance to damage
airflow in any meaningful way we also
did one with the GPU intake fan moved
directly over the GPU because the stock
configuration assumes a normal-sized
video card and to Silverstone's credit
the fact that this can fit something
like a ten and a half inch reference
card is impressive but that's how we're
reusing for our test bench we're using a
smaller card for compatibility with
basically all ITX cases and so for that
we moved the fan to the other slot so
that it would cool our GPU more directly
just for some comparative numbers and
data and overall a reminder as always
ITX case testing is difficult to do in a
scientific way but we're still
controlling for variables and all that
it means is that for cases that are
larger like a - ATX for an h 200 you can
put a bigger cooler in there and
obviously circumvent any potential
issues caused by a downdraft cooler for
this case you'll want to compare it most
directly something like the Taku or the
other ITX case is that silverstone makes
the SG series for example anything
that's small enough that you're forced
to use smaller coolers and components to
make the build work that's what the
direct comparison is whereas the larger
enclosures have that benefit of being
able to use a bigger cooler it's just
that for testing purposes we don't do it
but as always being fully transparent
and saying look this test methodology is
not perfect in fact it's the most
difficult to perfect out of all the
testing we do because ITX cases just
have so many dam options so we're doing
our best to normalize it but you have to
look at the data with some level of your
own direction what you're trying to do
with a build so you can just mentally it
make adjustments where you know you have
more room to put better coolers and
things like that so not hard and fast
data but a very good comparison for a
baseline starting with only the RV z03
before comparative data CBO delta T was
49.1 degrees Celsius under a torture
workload which remained within margin of
error of the GPU intake fan shifted over
which measured 48 point five degrees
over ambience because the configuration
of the case and the PCIe riser the CPU
and GPU are completely compartmentalized
and the airflow pattern of one doesn't
much affect the other putting the
external filters on didn't have any
significant effect on temperature either
which is good news for anyone planning
to use the case horizontally with fans
close to a dusty desk comparatively for
CPU thermals forty nine point one
degrees Celsius is definitively the
lowest CPU temperature we've measured
yet during an MIT X torture test and
that's thanks to the active cooling from
the case fans the RBZ 0-3 is
specifically designed for short flat
coolers like the cryo rig c7 we use for
testing so it's airflow pattern suits
our build much better than cases like
the thermal take core v1 that are
designed around tower coolers let's move
on the GPU thermals just for the raven
with all fans and stock positions GPU
temperature was fifty eight point one
degrees celsius over ambiens and again
this didn't change meaningfully with the
addition of filters where the case fans
shifted over the GPU though there was a
huge drop in temperatures down to 42
point three degrees celsius a ver egde
the stock fan configuration is more
suited to long graphics cards and
shifting the case van over to supply air
directly to the GPU makes sense for
cards with fewer than two fans in past
tests we've often seen a slight increase
in CPU temperatures as we push heat out
of the GPU more effectively but that
isn't an issue here because of the
separation between the chambers in this
case comparatively GPU thermals are next
the stock fan configuration still
resulted in better GB temperatures than
the cryo rate Taku but fifty eight point
one degrees Celsius tells us he /
ambience is still relatively warm the
fan pulls air inwards toward the front
of the GPU but the fan on the GPU cooler
is forced to fend for itself and pull
air from outside of the side panel vent
shifting the fan to this event let's the
GPU fan and the case fan work together
and vent air out of the back of the case
or even out of the empty fans lot the
pattern doesn't really matter because
it's isolated from the rest of the
components 42.3 degrees celsius is by
far the best GPU DT we've seen in an MIT
axe torture test so far GPU DT and 3d
mark was exactly the same as it was in
the torture test fifty eight point one
degrees Celsius over ambient again
that's better than the Taku but not over
all good and again if we moved the fan
over it it would cool much better as you
saw previously so this isn't really a
mark against the Raven just a note to be
conscious of how your video card is
positioned versus the fan rendering with
blender is up next
CPU Delta temperature during the Seabee
render was thirty nine point eight
degrees Celsius outstripping the
previous best average of forty five
point seven degrees Celsius over ambient
for the 280 X and that's by a
comfortable margin to thanks to the
internal separation of the case the GPU
idle barely above ambient during this
test at an average of seven point four
degrees Celsius delta T we always do
these tests with the fans in the stock
configuration so average GPU temperature
during the GPU render was a bit higher
than it needed to be at thirty five
point nine degrees that makes it yet
again better than the Taku and worse
than everything else with the fan moved
over however it would reasonably
expected to beat the every other case on
the chart as we saw in our initial
torture test the separation benefited
the CPU in this test just like it did
the GPU in the previous one and averaged
just sixteen point nine degrees Celsius
DT during the render since our CPU
cooler is invariably the loudest part of
our Mini ITX test bench we turn it down
to ninety percent for noise normalize
testing where we can in the RV's e03
that alone was enough to reach our
desired threshold moreover because the
cv benefits so much from the case pan
pushing air into it there was hardly any
difference in temperatures even with
this reduction in speed forty nine point
nine degrees celsius dt versus forty
nine point one v RM thermals were
measured with a k-type thermocouple
placed on the hottest mosfet vrm
temperatures average 34 point one
degrees celsius dt under load and vsoc
average 34 degrees that's even lower
than the open air test we did with cryo
eggs Taku drawer opened and it shows the
benefit of a side intake fan pointed at
the motherboard we measure of erm
temperatures just as a way to compare
cases there's little chance of it ever
get
into a dangerous level with the
components we're using they're far far
below a spec but it's a good way just to
measure the airflow patterns the raven
RB z03 is a tiny case with
disproportionately good cooling and
we're glad that we're doing ITX testing
now because it finally lets us test
things like this although as noted we
have a lot of things we're considering
redoing in our test methodology like for
example splitting off this test bench to
focus on cases of this size and building
a separate test bench maybe for cases
that would accommodate a 92 millimeter
cooler that's all under works and we'll
figure it out eventually as we do more
of these but for our ITX
test bench it's basically a perfect fit
for something like this and this case is
as noted just disproportionately good at
cooling for its size tolerances are
tight so if you're buying something like
this the measurements the dimensions of
everything should be checked and
rechecked a couple of times to make sure
you're not buying stuff that won't fit
technically it supports larger devices
bigger video card ATX power supplies up
to a certain degree 140 or so
millimeters but we find that these
smaller devices like SFX power supplies
are going to make your life a lot easier
just in cable management alone it's
impressive how effectively and
efficiently Silverstone has managed to
use the case in this small form-factor
they've got the space available is well
allocated in a way that makes a lot of
sense for compartmentalizing the GPU and
the CPU and building it in a way that is
not an inhibitor to the process so
although it's small and although it does
unique things with compartmentalization
the build process itself isn't
significantly more difficult than
normally more difficult yes but
primarily in a cable management
perspective silverstone has used space
well here without hurting performance
drive support is limited neither a 3.5
inch nor optical drives are supported so
that's a potential downside for you it's
probably more suited to a livingroom
gaming or streaming PC than it is as an
htpc unless you have your data storage
for all of your media content on a
separate device or an ass or something
like that the case is currently about a
hundred bucks I'm new I can Amazon will
link it below if you want it because we
do like the case overall it is one of
the better cases we've worked with it
some flaws yes it's not for everyone but
at its price it's a bit steep compared
to a lot of the MIT X cubes out there
like the core of you want do you want
something cheap and still pretty good
the thermaltake core v1 is great and the
silverstone SG 13 we worked with
previously is also pretty damn good but
it's just gonna depend on how much money
you have basically for your build this
case performs better than those two
technically it's just smaller so you can
put a bigger cooler on either of those
if you want to do in make up for a lot
of the differences and this is also
cheaper than Silverstone's
own similarly shaped ftz zero one which
we might be reviewing shortly we do have
one so anyway if you have interest in
ITX reviews that are similar to this
size please let us know what the cases
are called
post them below we'll try to get them
because we want to work with things
right now that are less of boxy and make
more sense for a downdraft or really low
profile cooler because that's kind of
what we spect
our test bench for so if you have ideas
on that stuff please post it below if
you have other ITX cases you want us
treat you that a more cube lake will
consider it it's just we might build a
new test bench for those first because
they do better with different components
so very difficult to test all these in a
standardized way but we'll do our best
