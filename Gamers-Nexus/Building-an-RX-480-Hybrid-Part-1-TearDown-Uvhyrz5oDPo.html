hybrid project this time star in the RX
480 so we just reviewed this thing the
reviews already on the channel I'm going
to put it under water or at least under
intense air and see if we can get it to
overclock further or do something
interesting anyway so first of all this
coverage is brought to you by Origin PC
and their new Origin Chronos which is a
customizable and upgradable PC now
shipping with the RX 480 so our original
hybrid projects starred the GTX 1080 we
put it with an EVGA hybrid cooler which
is one of these and I actually I have a
box of these now from ace tech makes
them so I decided we're gonna try and
put another one of these on but this
time the arts for ID I don't think the
mounting will fit actually I'm positive
it won't fit but we're gonna see if we
can either make it fit or use one of
these so I bought these out of pockets
this is not a sponsorship I don't even
know these are actually there this is
the Exelero mono plus this is a single
fan basically it mounts on top of the
GPU kind of like that just straight on
top of the GPU so it's effectively
putting a CPU cooler on a video card
it's a little insane the one I want to
try is this one which is the accelerated
that's for a 120 millimeter fan I bought
these vrm copper heat sinks in case we
need them or vram rather so we can put
those on the memory modules if we need
them if none of this other equipment
works then I was a backup I bought one
of these Exelero twin turbos which is
just a dual fan and do a blower fan so
the reason I got so many of these is
because this is a new it's got a couple
of new things first of all the GPU
itself which is the Polaris 10 chip does
have a smaller Z height than previous
AMD chips I think it's 1.5 millimeters
now it used to be one point nine
millimeters so that difference does mean
there may be some clearance issues also
the actual mounting is very similar to
the r9 380 and also very similar to the
I think the 370 and but it's not
identical so hopefully one of these will
work if not I also have an end exe
Kraken cooler if I wanted to use that
that's just a we've got the the g10
crack and cooler so if I wanted to go
that route I would have to get a copper
shim and put it between the cold plate
and the GP itself so we're gonna try and
avoid that and hopefully the mounting
for one of these kits will work but
first we have to disable or disable but
first we have to disassemble the video
card so that's what we're gonna do in
this part one video is take it apart and
I've got some tools for the job here so
let's just let's start pulling it apart
and see what we got so first off just
looking at it briefly this is got a
couple of it looks like Allen or hex
heads
so this allen key screws holding this
cover on and I think that's just a cover
I believe it will pull off with the rest
of the shroud I don't think we have to
actually remove that covered someone to
the fury X and that way we've got a
couple screws on the back which are
obviously holding the shroud to the PCB
and then these screws over here are
holding probably the heatsink with the
cold plate on top of the GPU that's
pretty standard anyway so first I'm
gonna try and take just the cover off
and see if we can see under there that's
a 3.5 that's too small doesn't look like
it's quite right now that's too small
this is gonna be way too big I've got
these crappy tools some of you probably
remembers my terrible multi-tool that is
used used for travel but we'll see it's
like a middle finger it's too small
obviously none of these metric ones fit
I don't know if these are Imperial or if
it's just a proprietary size but it's
not any metric sizes I have so we're
gonna try and work around this I don't
have Imperial allen keys that side we're
just gonna go ahead and start removing
the the shroud from the PCB oh wait you
know what I should do is okay so I'm
actually gonna mark these because I just
realized there's a lot of different
screwed sizes so we're gonna do the
classic quick and dirty video card Blair
fan 1/2
okay all right so let's get back to
pulling this thing apart
all right so that was a lot simpler than
the GTX 1080 already but we're not
really anywhere yet so we haven't made
progress yet I can see that the PCB is
coming off a bit so that does mean that
the screws we just took off we're the
ones securing the the shroud at least if
not the heatsink definitely the shroud
to the PCB so what's holding us now is
it looks like the expansion slot for
sure there's some tiny screws here that
I'm almost positive are holding in the
blower fan to the socket which you can
actually see through this cutout it's
kind of unique I'm not sure what the
sort of acoustic and temperature
properties are of having this cutout and
curious to find out I'll talk to AMD
about that but these almost certainly
hold that fan in so we're left with the
expansion slot and then there's these
tiny screws up here to which look like
they may just hold an embellishment
plate to the the base plate but we'll
find out soon I suppose so let's go
ahead and just take this expansion slot
apart there's there's two screws here
and there's obviously gonna be screws
coming through the PCB once we get in
there but those are access from the
other side there's one more tiny one
these are all uh they're pretty much the
same size Phillips head but the screws
themselves are different sizes so you
will want to do what we're doing and
separate these maybe draw it out on a
paper first because there's a couple
different screws and you don't want to
have trouble figuring out which ones go
where later because you've ever worked
with laptops you know that there are
times when it looks like one screw will
fit and then you find out later that it
was supposed to be a different screw and
it has to all come apart again so now
we've got a lot of play developing in
here and the shroud itself you can see
there's a lot of play in there which
means that we should be pretty much
ready to pull it apart I think this is a
very flexible PCB by
I don't know if you can see that I'm not
really pushing that hard it's not a
thick PCB but this is a $240 video card
so it's not the sort of beacon of
quality that you might see with a
higher-end product but it does have
something still holding it together
let's see if maybe maybe we have to take
the heatsink off now I'm gonna do
opposing corners here before completely
removing the screw to kind of ensure
that the I'm sure that the pressure is
about equal rather than just pop one off
and what does warranty void if removed
warranty void if removes okay so we
won't remove it I don't think that
counts so this is pretty good
these are spring-loaded screws spring
tension two screws excuse me so you can
see that as you tighten this down the
spring will tension and that will help
prevent the possibility of over torque
unit which is bad obviously for that
there all the screws are out of the back
and got the screws out of the expansion
slide oh okay there we go that actually
scared me for a second because if you
haven't noticed this cooler or the the
cooler and the shroud exceed the length
of the PCB see that and this is true
with some other cards to where the PCB
is pretty short on the reference PCBs so
this is interesting for a few reasons
one is AIB partner models might build
larger PCB cards and add more power
phases or more power headers if they
wanted an extra eight pen or six pin so
that's one thing but the interesting
point here this is so small that you
could probably throw like a passive
cooler on there and go with an alloy and
copper passive cooling solution and have
a pretty small and quiet card so we're
attached to obviously the the vrm fan
here which I'll let you get a shot of
that
before we pull it apart
this is this is difficult to try this
this is really
okay there we go all right so the fans
removed and now we have a look at the
PCB and the cooler completely separated
so obviously they point a few things out
for you we've got the blower fan here
three screws probably holding it in
these are thermal pads they are adhesive
you will want to try and get this back
on as quickly as possible if you're
going to be putting it back on these
adhere to these so these are vram
modules we have one two three four five
six seven eight of them we have eight
gigabytes of RAM so these are probably
one gigabyte modules and they are made
by Samsung from the looks of it
yeah that's Samsung and then the GPU
itself is actually really similar to the
renders that we have so that's kind of
cool this is the GPU this whole thing
right here is underneath is the
substrate so that green is the substrate
that silicon is right there which has
the if they don't paste on it and then
we've got some kind of shield right here
which probably is restrain thinning for
the most part we're gonna clean this off
I'll start with the heatsink here
there's a lot of a lot of compound on
there but I want to clean this off so
that when we apply the new solution I
like that they move apply the new
solution it will actually be properly
clean and have some good contact oh my
god drift they're all paste cleaning
method is so bad and you clean they're
all paste you should use water a
pea-sized blob oh wait let me see if
there's a way that I pull this out okay
so I just figured something out while
cleaning this thing first of all very
shiny yes we've got a copper cold plate
here surrounded by aluminium a bit
cheaper that way and then I kind of
typical or actually even old school
almost CPU cooler style aluminum heat
fins inside which would explain some of
the issues we've had with thermals in
the in the review because it doesn't
look there's not even heat pipe cooling
in here so very simple cooler we're
gonna go ahead and take that out just so
we can get a closer
got it so what I discovered by looking
around is it looks like these hold in
the plate that restricts us from
removing that cooler so I'm gonna take
these tiny tiny screws that we're not
gonna lose these we can see what that
what that cooler actually looks like up
close and see if there's a good reason
for why the thermals are so high that's
still held on I think high so there we
have it this is out so you've got all
the thermal pads here before I lose any
of these let's just look at where these
go and then we'll look at the rest
the vrm we've got chokes here these are
our chokes so our capacitors this is our
vram a feels like an aluminum that's an
aluminum base plate and then the
aluminum base plate turns into these
fins up here which honestly almost feel
more gimmicky than real but I guess they
do something because it's not thermally
shutting down despite being pretty warm
some more heat fins here I don't know
really I'd love to see kind of a
Windtunnel example of how this fan
interacts with these fins because I'm
sure there's some dissipation going on
but as many of you know intakes on the
side pulls air in side front bottom
pushes it through the card this way so
that will go through this heat sink and
this part I believe goes up kind of
against the fan like that and then this
part is going to be towards the back of
the car towards the expansion slot so
that'll push air through the fins out
the expansion slot these are not very
close together so we don't have a ton of
surface area to work with here in terms
of thermals it is a cheap aluminum
heatsink this is exactly why the
thermals are not great on the RX 4 idea
if you've seen our review it's
something like we were hitting something
like 56 57 Celsius delta-t with that
which is basically in the 80s absolute
temperature for this ambient environment
and that is for the auto setting so
that's just what AMD had it set up Auto
pre-configured in drivers radio settings
to stick to around 80 Celsius it can go
up to 90 and we hit it in some cases but
but this is exactly why the thermals are
a problem now in terms of overclocking
with the GPU I was hitting 13 40
megahertz the maximum configurable
setting in Radeon settings I think was
1350 vram I was hitting 2200 I think the
max configurable was 20 300 megahertz
I tried 2250 in a crash so maybe I don't
know if that's a cool and thin or
stability thing but if it's cooling we
can try and fix that with these things
later on these are significantly better
than this thermal pad to alloy base
plate setup that's on there now but of
course it doesn't really do anything if
you just sync the heat because you got
to dissipate it so let's see there gonna
be a blower fan or whatever cooler we
end up putting on here so this is the
whole card we've got this wrapping part
of the shroud this is on the video cards
as well than mine ATI and a 1080 this
one's particularly thin and cheap piece
of plastic but that's fine because all
they're trying to do is put this in
there like that and all it does is
direct the airflow so that all the air
pretty much goes straight through the
card through the alloy fins out of the
back and cools the GPU in the process
the vrm is cooled by the thermal pads
and some of the wind as well effectively
alright so now that we've got this
shroud off if we wanted to take this off
I'm not sure what size that is it might
be mounted from now
what it doesn't screw through so the the
cover the thing that I thought was the
cover because it is a cover on the are
nine fury X is fake if you look in the
back side if there's no mounting points
it doesn't like actually screw through
with these stupid propriety this is why
I couldn't take it off so it may not be
an Imperial driver thing it may just be
that these are cosmetic fake bolts which
are these even metal it's magnetized
pretty strongly actually and so unless
these are like aluminum well yeah unless
they're I don't know titanium bolts or
something non-magnetic I don't know if
that's a there's some alloy and titanium
bolts aren't magnetic but I don't know
it specifically either way these are
fake so it doesn't really matter what
metal they're made out of if it's any at
all or plastic even I think it is
actually plastic so that doesn't come
off it's obviously just an aesthetics
thing these holes aren't holes which was
already apparent if you even looked at
it so it's not like it's helping with
breathability or anything like that but
I'm curious if we took a drill and
drilled through a couple times that
would impact the thermals I think it's
like glued so this looks like it's just
bezel in see how it's like indented and
I think this is glued to the surface of
it but if we tried to force it I think
the there's like a star nut that was
closed right and that's that's pretty
close but I'd have to put like a rubber
band in there or something to to fill
the rest of the area those are
definitely plastic actually
you're like see this I'm scratching it
with the thing and look at that scratch
I just put in the service if you can
pick that up on my camera that is
obviously not metal that's plastic and I
bet if I like sat here and really
destroyed this shroud this thing is
either molded with the rest of the
shroud or it's glued to the surface but
let's let's look at our phase in here so
for the viewer I'm phasing it looks like
looks like a six phase vrm I believe
either that or it's a five plus one but
pretty basic VR I'm not bad I suppose in
terms of just raw phasing but I don't
really know anything about these
specific components how good they are
how chief they are or how expensive they
are but that is what our vrm setup is
normal capacitors and let's clean off
the the GPU and look at that and then
will pretty much be done with this
teardown I'm not gonna worry about
cleaning off every single bit of thermal
paste here we just really want to see
what the die looks like right now it's
just to see what kind of the branding is
if there is any what the maiden or
diffused and sticker says stuff like
that it looks like there are no words on
this one it's very simple just a shiny
mirrored piece of silicon basically okay
so actually the thermal pads the big
throne pad is coin VR M components but
it's not on top of the chokes or the
chokes and the capacitors it's actually
on top of this logic behind it which my
hands are full here but this is where
that pad goes so that's cooling that got
the chokes being cold
it looks like entirely by air so if we
kind of hold this together you'll see
that this mount
about like that more or less and the
wind comes through here so the air comes
through blower fan spins it'll circulate
through that plastic piece that we saw
get pushed through the aluminum fins
over the chokes and the capacitors and
then through these fins for further
dissipation what is that on top of
that's on top of that logic back there
so that will cool our MOSFETs chokes and
capacitors for the vrm and then it goes
out the card okay so I think that pretty
much sums up the teardown of this card
just for documenting reasons in the
future the model we have is called D
zero zero nine
so if future iterations of this product
are made either for gigabyte models or
updates to the existing eight gigabyte
model we have that number may change and
that is exposed already because there's
no backplate on this card so that's
something you could already see these
here zero nine you can see we've got
solder points for the six pin power
header there are no super-secret extra
solder points that would be done on a
custom PCB by aib partners if they
wanted to do them and that pretty much
sums it up so that is the am the rx 480
torn down and the next part of this
video we're gonna try and put these on
this is gonna be the interesting part
all right so I'm not sure if any of
these will work I don't know I don't
really know what the mounting hardware
is inside of these I know these are
compatible with the 380 with a 370 and
some of the other hardware that's got
completely different mounting types so
we will see if these fit if they don't
I'm gonna try and make them fit whether
there are X 480 likes it or not and if
you've seen our GT X 1080 hybrid video
you know that will will make it work
alright so thank you for watching as
always page howlings in hotel video if
you wanna helps out directly article in
the description below for the review of
the our X 480 on the channel we've got
the review of the the card and we have a
noise comparison test which shows this
vrm blower fan at various speeds yeah so
thanks for watching that subscribe for
the next part of this series will be two
or three parts I'll see you all next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
