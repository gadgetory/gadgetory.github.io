Intel nook it's the Hades Canyon one
that in town and II worked on together
the cooler is now significantly larger
than the product and what we've done is
we stuck a be quiet silently 280 on top
of the CPU and the GPU which are on the
same substrate but they're not the same
silicon one is a Vega M GPU from AMD
the other is an Intel i7 CPU between the
two of them there's a good amount of
power that we need to dis to cool and
dissipate and plug it into the wall as
well we were pushing upwards of 200
watts draw during some of our tests so
it was time for somebody cooling to see
how far we could overclock the hades
canyon nook before that this is brought
to you by the msi gtx 1080 gaming X and
Nvidia's GeForce experience which allows
you to retro actively capture key
gameplay moments with shadowplay convert
captures into gifs with new tools and
apply filters to games hashtag no filter
MSI's gaming X PCBs are high quality
with well-built power management and
coolers that we've previously
recommended learn more at the links in
the description below so our goal here
was to see if we can hit 5 gigahertz
that's kind of the magic nice round
number for Intel CPUs we were hitting
about 4.2 to 4.3 previously with the
stock cooled Intel nook and that was
just using a couple of the blower fans
that come with it these right here and
an aluminum thin stack basically pretty
simple but we were running into thermal
limitations the liquid cooling should
resolve that pretty handily the biggest
concerns we have here of course are
going to be vrm cooling because we've
removed the heatsink from the V RMS and
the cold plate here doesn't contact them
so we can solve that pretty easily a fan
high rpm fan right next to it it blows
air across the cold plate for whatever
parts of the cold plate are exposed and
then also across the vrm components
they're fine so that takes care of that
problem very easily and then we also had
the resolved mounting pressure there's
not a good solution to that other than
maybe a clamp like a woodworking clamp
just stick it on there with a non
conductive surface in between the clamp
and the PCB or something but we have
just
the zip ties for now it's not the best
solution our biggest weak point with
this whole project is the mounting
pressure however it still worked and it
worked pretty well just I think partly
because of the brute force solution I'm
using a 280 millimeter liquid cooler
with two maglev fans from Corsair and
another NZXT fan blowing air across the
V RMS that's a pretty good brute force
method to fix everything so previously
4.2 gigahertz to 4.3 hitting 95 plus
degrees Celsius depending on what we
were testing and that was on the CPU GPU
is also getting pretty warm 60 70 s
depending on the workload let's get into
the new overclocking results before this
section we're planning to do a live
stream with this version of the Intel
nook the hades Canyon hybrid as we're
calling it so I don't know if this video
will go before after the live stream but
we'll be doing a live stream and trying
to push further than we got for this
video so if the live stream is online go
check the results of it because we might
have gotten further and if it's not then
stick around and come back tomorrow
but basically we had about 4.7 gigahertz
so we got an extra 400 megahertz to 500
megahertz depending on what we were
testing for point seven very stable we
offset the voltage 0.06 volts and in CPU
intensive workloads that are 100% CPU
we're still running into some thermal
issues but for other tasks like fire
strike as you'll see momentarily
we had temperature drops upwards of 30
plus degrees Celsius 40 in the case of
some overclocking temperatures vs. stock
air cooling significant reductions but
again at times with CPU loads that were
really abusive we'd still end up in the
90s and that was at 4.7 gigahertz so we
are presently bound by either voltage or
silicon quality or something like that
so the plan is to at some point fix the
mounting pressure or put an even bigger
cooler on it we also did CL 19 for the
memory that seems reasonably stable seal
19 29 33 for the they just sent us
HyperX memory with the nook we're using
the high-end one that's like $1200 and
with an i7 and the vegam high-end mobile
Vega version of the GPU we were between
13 40 and 13 70 megahertz
GPU tend to be 1370 that's up from 13 20
megahertz on the GPU we're at nine fifty
megahertz max 935 sometimes or HBM two
depending on how stable the game is and
that's up from 900 megahertz on HP m2 we
had to down clock for a couple of games
overall though between 4 to 500
megahertz extra on the CPU overclock and
then 50 megahertz extra on the GPU
overclock 50 megahertz extra on the HBM
to overclock depending on the title
that's pretty damn good for just
brute-force cooling so let's go over
some of the power numbers and thermals
and see how those look we thought we'd
be running into power limitations with a
higher overclock a logging power meter
put us at around 190 watts for fire
strike extreme but about 150 watts for
CBS works like when we use blender to
render things we were at 200 watts peak
under any load conditions and some games
were about that high the power brick is
the next consideration not one that we
had considered actually it's 230 watts
for the brick so it's I think it's
eleven point eight amps at nineteen
point five volts this puts you about 230
watts multiply the two together so we
could potentially become limited but
we're at 200 watts peak and that's at
the wall measurement so that's before
efficiency loss and things like that so
we're pretty much towards the upper or
the the limits of that power brick to
get any further beyond it we'd have to
like grab a similarly rated laptop power
supply at 300 watts or something and
solder the end onto it or something like
that I don't really know the best
solution but that'd be the the next
limiter after thermal which we've
somewhat solved and after voltage we're
limited by power so thermally though
let's go over those numbers the hybrid
mod under stock conditions operated at
about 33 degrees cooler and CB
temperature than the stock configuration
not bad considering our mounting
pressure isn't the best here it just
goes to show how much brute force can
make up for other deficiencies our
overclock had us about four degrees
warmer than stock and GPU thermals were
also dropped about 30 degrees down from
73 degrees Celsius we're also cooler
let me stock 100% fan configuration
while being significantly quieter at
around 42 DBA
versus north of 50 DBA even SSD
motherboard and other temperatures are
significantly reduced to the less
impressive than CPU and GPU temperatures
we have more overclocking Headroom now
and will likely run to again voltage or
power walls before thermal walls but we
could further improve thermals by
clamping down that cold blade a bit
harder again there's one scenario where
our thermals don't look as good as the
previous charts and that would be in a
100% CV torture workload ie a generally
synthetic power virus workload we're in
ongoing CPU targeted stress tests with
FFTs or something like that we're still
hitting almost 100 degrees Celsius we're
between 90 and 94 on some cores but not
all which again would be indicative of a
potential mounting pressure difference
not a surprise given how we've mounted
the cooler to the board really not not
surprising anyone so yeah that's again
biggest weakness but overall it's doing
pretty well the V RMS our caps complete
with inspect they're well under 100
degrees and well under and that's just
from a 2,000 rpm fan on it so a total
non-issue for the V RMS not really
practical but for cases purposes of
overclocking it's completely fine well
start a game testing the same way we did
in the review remember we didn't know
what to expect for the initial review so
we started with our low end GPU test
suite before moving up to higher end DGP
benchmarks after seeing the relative
performance of Hades Canyon starting
with rocket League at 1080p and
relatively high settings we observed
Hades Canyon stock at 162 FPS average
with lows proportionately behind at 118
and 96 fps
Hades Canyon with a stock cooling and an
overclocked received an impressive 12
percent performance uplift and that's
from a 4.3 gigahertz all core turbo and
13 20 megahertz GPU core 900 megahertz
on the HBM going to 4.7 gigahertz and
1350 to 935 megahertz on the GPU
components gave us an uplift of 5
percent over the previous overclock not
a ton but we think we can get more with
further tuning which is something again
we'll consider doing on a live stream if
you all show interest leave a comment
below if you're interested in that
one more reference before moving on to
the higher end testing for dota 2 with
dx11 we saw a performance baseline of
126 FPS average complete stock which
gained at 9 percent performance with an
overclock and stock cooling air from the
original build our liquid mod moved us
up to 145 FPS average a jump of 6
percent over the previous overclock 137
FPS average or a jump of 16 percent over
the 126 FPS baseline not bad at all for
something that is really basically
laptop components for honor is our first
intensive high on d GPU benchmark at
1080p extreme settings we measured the
original Hades Canyon no cat 59 FPS
average with the original overclocked
version of the nut gaining 10.7% landing
at 65 FPS average the liquid-cooled
version didn't improve much getting
stuck at around 60 at FPS average a gain
of 5% comparable to previous data that
puts our note as nearing the RX for 70
and i2 770 700 K for performance where
the rh 470 is not bound by the cpu we
treat ashes of the singularity like a
synthetic benchmark for these so it's
unrealistically configured to 4k and
high settings again that's because it's
a synthetic tool for % scaling between
high-end GPUs the stock nook operated at
30fps with the stock cooling overclocked
at 33 points 6 FPS again that's in the
50s for decibels because we're at 100%
fan speeds the hybrid mod is at 34.8 FBS
here that puts our hybrid as 16% faster
than the stock air-cooled unit or about
3.6 percent ahead of the air-cooled
overclock not as impressive we're way
ahead of the 1050 Ti in performance
partly thanks to using dx12 with ashes
and a bit behind the RX 470 Sniper Elite
gives us a Vulcan and asynchronous
compute workload to consider where
Polaris and Vega tend to be advantaged
by architecture this one is also the
least exciting we gained from 72 FPS to
80 point eight FBS a verge with our
previous tests for about an eleven point
six percent improvement with a hybrid
mod we were within margin of error for
improvement and it seems that we were
bumping into other limitations with this
title something we'll explore if we do a
live stream overclock so we didn't quite
make it to 5 gigahertz
yet but there are a few tricks I have
here one of them is potentially just
fixing some of the thermal limitations
fairly because even if we're running a
non CV benchmark where we're not
thermally limited with this mod we're in
like the 40s or 50s sometimes for
temperature even in those scenarios
having a better cooler can still help
because we'll reduce power leakage in
our previous testing we've found and
published that roughly every 10 degree
reduction in CV temperature results in
about a 4% reduction in power
consumption from leakage so if we can
further reduce the thermals to a point
that we somewhat reduced the power
leakage that was just a couple extra
watts to play with out of the 230 watt
hour break without having to hard mod
that brick which we'd really prefer not
to do although would be an interesting
project I'm just not sure how it turned
out because we're not as experienced
with that but again I don't know about 5
gigahertz we can definitely push the 4.8
because it's semi stable a bit more
voltage would stabilize it
that could be achievable in some
benchmarks like fire strike we probably
passed those but not blender or prime
and more mounting pressure with a clamp
would fix any of those limitations - so
we've got room to do more and push this
further we definitely have room to push
the memory further because it currently
CL 19 and 29 33 megahertz but that's
where we'll leave it for now either way
a lot of fun for the project this thing
is not exactly a work of art okay but
it's functional and you have to give
credit because a 30 to 40 degree drop
and some of the temperature values we
saw is pretty substantial and that did
absolutely give us 400 to 500 megahertz
more on the CPU and an extra 50
megahertz on the GPU core extra 50 on
the HBM overall a massive uplift but I
would like to push it further so make
