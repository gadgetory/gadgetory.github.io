with products branded aged 500 there was
the original H 500 P then our mesh mod
then the disappointment PC build and the
H 500 P mesh and most recently the H 500
M over the last year Coolermaster has
completely turned around its age 500 P
into an excellent product in the age 500
P mesh and furthered that development
with the aged 500 app we're now looking
at the opposite end of the price scale
with the company's new age 500 no suffix
letter on that just straight h 500
priced at $100 and borrowing many of the
improvements made on it's more expensive
counterparts before that this video is
brought to you by Thermal Grizzlies
high-end thermal paste and liquid metal
thermal Grizzlies cryo knot is an
affordable high quality thermal compound
that doesn't face some of the aging
limitations of other pastes on the
market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted test by a tube at the link
in the description below the look of the
h 500 family was firmly established by
the age 500 p over the past year
actually and that followed the same
trend of moving to two hundred
milliliter fans that we saw an old old
cooler master cases like the 912 the
half x and so forth where they tried to
adopt larger and larger fans which is a
fad that sort of died for a while and it
came back with the h 500 p and that's
where we are today the aged 500 sticks
with the two hundred millimeter fans on
the front it's got a 120 in the back and
in terms of the exterior of the case
it's actually a good bit different from
the other h 500 series cases so the
first thing you'll notice is the front
top now has sort of the bump that the
old nine 12 the 922 932 that those cases
had back then when that was new kohler
master had advertised this section of
the case as quote a top platform for
personal belongings but now they've
actually made more use of it so that's
it's kind of a funny thing to say I mean
you can just make it literally flat if
that's what you wanted
but for this one they've made it a bit
more functional so while it is a top
platform for personal belongings you can
also use it as a literal handle so it is
actually functional it's not the
sturdiest handle in the world it's not
metal but it doesn't seem like it's
going to fall off with a reasonable
weight specie inside of it so overall
the case is another H 500 series case it
takes the same kind of air flow idea and
layout of H 500 people match it does
ship with an acrylic front power panel
as an alternative to this mesh one if
you wanted to go back to the oGH 500 P
look with an acrylic front panel
suffocating the two 200 Miller defense
there's still some issues with the fans
kind of jutting out kind of far and if
you want to pull air in through this
side ventilation you're really going to
struggle as you'll see in our thermal
testing but Coolermaster ships now stock
with the mesh installed which is great
you'll see that it performs pretty well
with mesh actually there's really not
much to complain about with it
other changes include the power supply
shroud so this is pretty interesting the
PSU shroud now uses a single thumb screw
to hold in and socket so it's it's not
difficult to remove and it also doesn't
wobble around so if they've done well
with that just kind of socket into place
with one thumb screw it's only a half
shroud now so the half length shroud
means that fortunately there are
actually some further airflow benefits
to the GPU power supply shrouds are
actually pretty bad for GPU airflow
overall normally you can deal with it
with just really directional fans but
cutting it in half means that some more
of this air gets finds its way up into
the video card cooler just from natural
pressure of the video card pool cooler
pulling air around this axial fans so
overall a couple of small design changes
versus the existing h 500 series that
make a pretty big impact on the cooling
and also just on the look externally
changes for the panels it's only one
tempered glass panel it's $100 case this
is the main feature of it is that it's
half the price of the H 500 and it's 50
bucks cheaper than H 5 and B mesh but it
takes the same basic ideas that the H
500 P mesh has and cuts out a couple of
the extra features so some of the extra
paneling on the back that we've always
complained about so longer there
and that's fine because it was just kind
of wasted money in a lot of instances
anyway we felt like and bringing the
price down is more important in this
class anyway the panel still has this
side panel still has the flathead screws
which we've never liked there are way
better ways to do this like a thumb
screw but they have two of them the
house oh not sure that's better or worse
however it does hook in at the bottom so
the panel when you loosen these remove
them it'll just kind of hang they're
hooked in that which is great so overall
pretty good improvements let me go
through Patrick's build notes for this
he spent a lot of time assembling
disassembling it and then I'll talk
through our testing results for thermals
and noise if you're curious about how
this one performed so speaking again to
that optional acrylic panel let's say
you did want to install it for some
reason the stock case is fitted with a
big rectangle of mesh similar to the one
we praised in the H 500 P mesh which can
be swapped out by removing eight screws
no adhesive this time so that's good we
don't recommend it removing it and
putting the acrylic panel in but having
choice comes out as a net positive this
is finally a way for Coolermaster to
have their cake and eat it too
and also push their modularity focus
that they've tried with other cases and
this is also without releasing two
different products cues or selling
alternate front panels separately taking
the front panel off to clean it and swap
the filter out of the mesh isn't too
easy like the original h 5e or too hard
like practically every other case there
are four plastic tabs holding it on
nothing fancy and it's tight enough that
it won't fall off when picked up like
one of the other cases the top panel
isn't removable at all because it's part
of the chassis and there are no fan
cages at this time around but since the
fan screws are directly accessible from
the outside of the case it's unnecessary
it's invisible when the case is
assembled but other H 500x cases have a
little mesh apron covering and that's at
the bottom under the intake for the
front panel it's fragile it makes them
sort of painful to pick up if you grab
them in the wrong place and I always
felt like a design afterthought and the
H 500 the mesh is built into the front
panel instead and this is an extremely
minor feature but it's an indication
that cooler masters engineers are really
working on small improvements even ones
that aren't externally visible
is a vertical GPU mount and we normally
test this and write a short segment in
the thermal section about how mounting
air-cooled GPUs flush with the side
panel is a bad idea
coolermaster saved us time by making the
vertical mount single slot so liquid
cooled cards are practically the only
thing that will even fit like the
interchangeable front panel that's a
clever move it adds value to the case
and we can't complain about how bad it
is for air-cooled cards because they
don't fit so the solution it seems is to
force people to use open-loop cooling
and that's fine the launch of the H 500
P had a finicky shroud that needed to be
removed in order to install the power
supply and that's been improved in
subsequent revisions base 500 is one of
the best so far and it's probably the
cheapest as well it's made of a plastic
rather than steel only covers half of
the bottom the case which is great heat
isn't trapped from the hard drive cage
and air from the intake fans isn't
stolen by the shroud but it's still long
enough to hide power supply cables and
not difficult to get in and out although
you do need to remove it to get the
power supply in the whole thing slides
out with removal of a single thumb screw
and then it's just socketed in cable
management clearance is good behind the
motherboard and it needs to be because
the limited room and the half shroud
there art I points and cutouts
absolutely everywhere and the kale
management bar is as good as it has been
on the other models coolermaster has
omitted the plastic cover for the CPU
socket and the steel cable cover saying
this time around as well and that's
another good call especially if it's
helped lower costs side-by-side
comparison reveals various other tweaks
that make it seem like Coolermaster took
a step back consider what was really
necessary and then stripped the rest out
we approve of this broach the tempered
glass side panel has a big metal lip at
the bottom that helps it from falling
out and we like the use of screws
instead of a latch that the other H 500x
cases although we still don't like the
sort of coin size or flathead sized
driver end that they require thermal
testing is pretty simple this time
around so as always full article in the
description below if you want to read it
instead but we have our test methodology
in there I'll leave it to the article
click on that if you want to learn more
thermal testing so we kind of limited
what we're doing here we've tested so
many aged 500 case
spine not just from cooler mastery there
are other companies have their own age
five hundreds like NZXT so we have at
least eight videos and articles if not
more now about thermals of H 500x insert
suffix case and if you want a whole lot
of detail go check those out but we're
just gonna go through the most important
stuff for the new age 500 rather than
focus like 20 minutes of discussion on
it because it's been done before a whole
lot and although there are changes here
we can go over them pretty quickly so
let's do that
this first CB a torture chart just shows
a couple of previous Coolermaster H 500
series cases will expand in a moment for
the new H 500 CPU DT was forty nine
point nine degrees over ambient during
the torture test which jumped up to
fifty six point nine degrees Celsius DT
with the acrylic panel instead we've
driven this point into the ground over
the past reviews but the unventilated
front panel force is 200 millimeter fans
to draw air in at a 90 degree angle from
the sides which reduces pressure as the
air makes a 90-degree turn or multiple
of them large slow-moving fans also tend
to have low static pressure putting mash
rather than acrylic in front of the fans
allows them to reach mostly their full
potential
we have other H five hundreds on here
all isolated for easy comparison so for
example we can see that forty nine point
nine CDT is a bit warmer than its fellow
H 500m at forty five point six or H five
hundred B mesh at forty eight point two
but still among the top performers on
our next chart moving on it's a
comparative data with other cases stock
temperatures are certainly cooler than
the original H 500 P but the acrylic
panel made at fifty six point nine
degrees over ambient the case is
performing reasonably well overall for
CPU thermals and is comparable to other
top quarter performers in our testing
given the reduced price point of one
hundred dollars the nearby performance
the H hundred B mesh which we
recommended this is all appreciated GPU
DT averaged forty eight point five
degrees Celsius during torture testing
this increased even more than CPU DT did
with the acrylic panel up to fifty seven
point nine degrees with less air coming
in the front air flow could be biased
towards the exhaust fan behind the CPU
leaving a dead zone at the bottom of the
case forty eight point five C for the H
500 is the best GPU temperature for an H
500 x case so far probably because of
the half shroud even though
there's an HDD cage directly in front of
the bottom intake it's still less of an
obstruction than a full power supply
shroud which blocks or steals a
significant portion of the incoming air
at the bottom of the case that puts the
H 500 GPU cooling on the same level as
some of our top performing cases we've
tested like the PMO one and our vo2
obviously using the acrylic panel ruins
that putting it closer to the 805
infinity the 3dmark fire strike extreme
test resulted in an average gbzt of
forty nine point three degrees Celsius
lower than anything else on the chart
except for the half X which had a side
intake fan pointed directly at the GPU
GPU temperatures are the main
performance advantage that h 500 hazard
with h 585 would be mash which are
fairly similar except with a power slide
shroud moving on to blender rendering on
the CPU put the average CPU dt at thirty
five point seven degrees celsius or
ambient cooler than most of the other
cases on the charge and just about equal
to the h 500 b mesh and the open air to
reconquer GPU rendering only raised GPU
DTS a twenty four point three degrees
Celsius also one of the lowest
temperatures on the chart and again
similar to the Cooper Concord it beats
the age 500 m and H 500 P mesh here with
and without mash the H 500 for noise
falls exactly where it should on the
chart forty point nine DBA with the mesh
front is on par with the H 585 dirty
mesh while 39.3 DBA is right between the
H 500 P and H 500 M with a glass front
panel all the H 500x cases we've tested
fall in a fairly narrow DBA range
towards the upper end of our scale we
poked some fun at it a little earlier
but naming the case the H 500 will
actually prove smart further down the
line we made such a fuss over the H 500
P largely because coolermaster compared
it to the half the review documents
literally said guaranteed high volume
airflow or something like that but the
brandy now calling this new case H 500
without a suffix implies that this is
the base mop and that the H 500 is
closer in looks and cost to a classic
mid-range half case as you can see here
then the H private P or H 500 e mesh or
H 5 or damn have been so MSRP for the
age of 500 at a hundred bucks $50 less
than the mesh version stripping out a
bunch of stuff that we never
particularly found
useful or desirable it's a good price
point thermals are good price is good
colormaster includes two options for the
front panel if you really want them that
we like to stock one it's hard to
imagine being too dissatisfied with this
case unless you take issue with the
appearance which is fair that's
subjective if you don't like how it
looks plenty of other cases out there
like the H 500 if you're stuck to that
name from NZXT so you can even have a
case with the same name if you wanted it
with different looks but the point is we
don't have any issues with this one in
fact if you're if you've been looking at
the H 5 would be mesh and you really
like to be just couldn't imagine
stretching to a 150 bucks for a case
then this is a pretty damn good
alternative at 50 dollars cheaper it's a
bit smaller in some ways there's less
plastic which actually I prefer
personally fewer metal parts and sort of
the back end of the case also something
we prefer so really other than the color
difference and some looks differences
there's not a lot that you could dislike
about the H 500 Blanc
no no suffix on it feels weird to say
that so that's it for this one pretty
straightforward we don't have a ton of
problems with it so a great job
Coolermaster in team a good price point
on this one this is why product
segmentation works out sometimes because
by being able to use some of the same
tooling or at least some of the same
branding or naming or whatever companies
can reduce overhead overall make a
cheaper product you end up with
something like this so better than the
original H 500 P and comparable to the H
5 and P match which we liked as always
