the H 150 I pro the first two
closed-loop liquid coolers to use the
ASA tech sixth generation pump as we
said in the H 150 I Pro review Mesa Tech
didn't do Corsair any favors here the
new pump isn't much different from the
old one and primarily focuses on RGB
implementations akin to NZXT T's custom
work on the X x-2 series regardless
courser has taken this and used it as an
opportunity to bundle their new CLC's
with silenced focused fans the ML 120
pro fans before that this video is
brought to you by thermal grizzly makers
of the conductor hot liquid metal that
we recently used to drop 20 degrees off
of our temperatures thermal grizzly also
makes traditional thermal compounds we
use on top of the IHS like cryo not and
hydronaut pastes learn more at the link
below this review is pretty basic it's
not too hard to go through or digest but
let's recap a couple of the main
differences with the ASX
sixth-generation pump so the 6th gen
pump is one that we tore down previously
with the h 150 i pro this one right here
it's a 360 cooler it should be priced at
150 260 USD this one's 140 now I say the
360 should be because checking new egg
there was one third-party marketplace
seller who listed the H 150 I Pro for
six hundred and fifty dollars basically
the cost of well I would say graphics
card but we all know how that goes so
the cost of a 1050 right now anyway
though that's supposed to be 150 160
this is 140 Price certains 10 bucks not
a big difference for 360 versus 280 now
as far as performance Corsair basically
focused their fans used on these devices
the ML 120 s to be more silence driven
they don't spin up that fast then all on
20 pros really only go up at 140
millimeters to about 1050 1100 rpm
somewhere in that range and that means
you're gonna be limited on your cooling
performance but if the focus is silent
and not cooling then we need to focus
more on how does it perform for
acoustics as far as the AC tech pump to
get everyone back up to speed when we
did our teardown of this cooler the
primary difference is where the actual
impeller inside of the pump block so the
impeller is now a metal impeller that
more resembles the old Dyna Tron
impellers that were used in an Tex 1250
series coolers it's more similar to
those it's a bit higher quality than the
three-pronged plastic impeller that was
used in ASA tech forth 4.5 and 5th gen
products including the previous H 150
and I not to be confused with the HT 115
I pro both are 280 milliliters
the fans are significantly different and
the pumps are one generation or so apart
might be two at this point but the ASA
tech contributions though basically
different impeller and the different
impeller is part of an effort to
maintain low permeation of the tubes and
of the liquid leaving the loop over time
so you have slightly different aging
characteristics between the pumps six
gens not been out long enough to really
fully gauge those yet it should
theoretically be better in terms of
noise and cooling performance and pump
speed things like that a sec hasn't
changed a whole lot of course hair
dictated most of the design the coat
plates a little bit smaller things like
that but the primary differences really
do come down to the impellers different
and there's built-in RGB integration now
with the ACE tech stock coolers which we
have footage of the ASA tech stock ones
before they get branded as well let's
get into testing though for full testing
methodology as always click the link in
the description below for the full
article which has testing notes as
indicated there's a silence focused its
loudest noise output for full system the
way is with two 140 ml pros is only
thirty seven ish DBA as we'll get to
which means that for noise normalized
thermals which we do at 40 DBA
we run into a bit of a problem but we'll
talk about that in a moment for standard
flat out thermal testing the coarser h
115 i pro lands about fifty to sixty
percent of the way down our full chart
the flat out speeds for the h 115 i pro
operate right around EVGA c LC 280 at
equivalent RPMs in terms of thermal
performance EVGA spins a lot faster but
when we match them to the same RPMs
they're not too different at 39 degrees
above ambient h 115 i pro is operating
at 37 decibels DBA
something we'll discuss later and lands
just three degrees warmer than the 360
millimeter H 150 I pro at 40 DB a
position versus the EVGA CLC 280
performance is similar at ten fifty rpm
but other factors enter play EVGA is CLC
280 cost about $140 the same as the H
115 I Pro and takes a much different
visual approach EVGA fans can spin up
significantly faster as well but will
hit 57 DBA when maxed basically unusable
at that noise level unless in very
specific use cases other competitors
adjacent to the 115 I pro include the X
40 to 140 cooler at much higher fan
speeds of 1700 rpm and of course higher
noise levels and the Ice Bear 420 at
lower fan speeds and with anemic fans
and an anemic pump moving on to noise
testing the coarser H 115 I Pro again
looked at silence we see that the
out-of-the-box acoustics operating at
100% fan speeds land the H 115 I Pro at
37 DBA for total system noise in this
testing this plants it within margin of
error of the X 61 at 10:50 rpm and CLC
280 at 10:50 rpm the difference between
these rankings is that unlike EVGA x ext
Corsair is already at its maximum fan
speed the included fans been at lower
rpm and coarser does excellently here
for focusing on limiting the noise
output and has managed to build a set of
fans that operate at a competitive noise
and thermal level with other 280
millimeter closed-loop coolers when have
similar noise levels on this chart
barring the ek predator that was
manually tuned to the lowest rpm it
could sustain the H 115 I Pro is
technically the quietest 280 cooler to
be fair though it is within margin of
error of others that have been manually
tuned down to lower speeds we didn't
have the same highly audible pump whine
as we did with the H 150 I pro but each
cooler uses an AC tech 6 gen pump we'd
imagine this is more to do with
manufacturing tolerances in variants
than anything in our H 115 I Pro came a
bit later so it might be from a
different production batch maybe retail
as opposed to pre-production or
something like that for noise
normalization it doesn't really work
here like it normally does in order to
hit 40 DBA on the
115 I Pro we'd have to use it louder and
faster fans on the cooler typically this
is a test of 40 DB a output with stock
fans Corsair operates below that
natively even with full system noise
factored in so we'll keep this in mind
for future noise normalization
benchmarks and might do an additional
lower DBA noise test regardless just for
perspective h1 15 I pro at 37 DB a
functionally handicapped versus the
others and a 3 DB a difference which is
there for entering noticeable territory
lands between the EK flute gaming at 240
and the original h 115 I unit not the
pro just to be clear here and then it
all comes down to price the H 115 I pro
is $140 the H 150 I pro should be 150
160 in that range not a big price
difference you do get a bit more
flexibility on fan tuning it with the
360 rad instead but it comes down to
whether you want to actually do that
type of thing and also does it fit in
the case in question EVGA CLC 280 is
also about 140 these days and the H 159
on Pro is 130 $240 X 52 $131 they're all
about the same in terms of price it's a
10 maybe $20 variants for all these
coolers in terms of cooling performance
if you're willing to change the fan
speeds the thermal performance can be
made about equal the out of the box
acoustics as opposed to the out of box
thermals is the bigger question here if
you're not willing to do any fan speed
tuning or any custom fan curves and you
just run it flat out the H 115 I Pro
will start you at a much lower noise
level and still perform completely
adequately for basically any CPU under
reasonable conditions ie not the hashtag
rip LTT CPU benchmark we recently ran
because that was a lot of wattage but up
until crazy points like that it's pretty
good it will perform slightly behind in
terms of thermals when matched against
things that are louder or allowed to
operate louder like the EVGA CLC 280 at
max fan rpm but at max fan rpm that
cooler is about 57 DBA in our testing so
you enter territory where it's kind of
unusable for a lot of people it'll come
down then to how you feel about the
noise and how you feel that doing work
fan curves this doesn't really leave you
much room to do much tweaking because
it's already more or less operating at
its optimal level in terms of noise to
performance so you don't have a lot of
room to play there you can lower the
RPMs if you want it even quieter but
there's no room to go up and that think
pretty much wraps up the cooler overall
the H 150 I Pro I think somewhat
disappointed us it was not an intensely
large improvement over previous coolers
that Corsairs made the main differences
are things that we can't see I think
that's kind of why it's easy to be
disappointed by the new pro series of
coolers that use six gen pumps because
if most of the improvements are things
like improving reliability on ASA tax
end and decreasing permeation slowing
down the rate of permeation improving
the pump in a way that air pockets or
hot spots in the tubing don't form as
much or hot spots in the pump housing
don't form and cause plastic to deform
over time stuff like that that's
basically mostly improvements as ASA
tech has informed me in the past so if
those are most the improvements that
stuff you can't really see and in terms
of warranty they're not all that
different I think it might be a
difference of a year or something that
most but either way primarily invisible
improvements doesn't mean they're not
there it just means that it might not be
something you'd ever notice because it's
something you'd have to have old and new
simultaneously and function and also
lots of them to eliminate variance but
that's that's it if you're looking at
buying an H 115 I we still like that
cooler a lot you can get a $10 cheaper
the fans run faster and therefore it can
cool better however it uses the old
generation pump which may be completely
irrelevant we need time to tell and it
uses faster fans so you have to do a bit
of tuning and that's that's really all
there is to it it comes down to how you
feel about the noise so that's it for
