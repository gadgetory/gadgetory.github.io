the h2 70 and z2 70 chipsets for intel's
upcoming kb lake platform if you don't
already know you can with most
motherboards flash existing platforms
like z170 so that they will support the
kb lake cpus because the socket type is
the same but there are a few more
differences with the new platforms i'll
be going through those briefly today
before we get into that this content is
brought to you by MSI and their new
Trident gaming PC which is on the table
here and that is a GTX 1060 equipped
machine very small for about $1000 link
the description below for more
information so it's been a little while
since we talked about chipsets and their
differences I think the last time was
probably for the skylake platform we'll
be doing that for this one and then
again for Zen all those ends a bit
different and we'll talk about why at
that point for now the major items to
look at with Intel chipsets are the HS
io lanes or high-speed IO and put output
and that's basically Intel's way of
assigning lanes to different devices and
the manufacturer of the motherboard has
some level of control over to what
device those lanes go so there's a base
sort of set of lanes that go to USB and
things like that with Intel's platform
but the motherboard vendor can then
decide to peel off some of those lanes
and assign them to whatever devices they
may deem necessary for example the z2 7
ths i/o lanes now versus z170 have
increased by four so there are four more
HS io lanes with z2 70 it's at 30 versus
26 for the z170 platform and then h2 70
is also at 30 this is new h1 70 didn't
have the same Lane count as e1 70 in
fact it was 22 versus 26 so I had four
fewer now with the next generation with
kb lake it will be at parity so z2 70 +
h2 70 have the same HS io lane
assignment
the differences are elsewhere like multi
GPU support and things like that I'll
talk about that in a moment but that's
up to speed so those are on par h1 70
was at 22 just kind of for reference be
150 has 18 and h1 10s 14 what are these
HSI o lanes go to though they go to
things like gigabyte Ethernet I talked
about this with the previous chip side
comparison Gigabit Ethernet you can peel
them off if you wanted to to a PCIe slot
though there's some issues there you can
send them to m dot 2 devices for SSD
support things like that and say to save
Express stuff of that nature and USB 3
so that's what the lanes do the base for
Z 270 in addition to its HSI Elaine
assignment the chipset has 24 additional
3.0 lanes pcie 3.0 and the pcie 3.0
config that's natively supported only
supported on z2 70 is you can have 1 by
16 card you can have 2 by 8 cards or you
can have 1 by 8 with 2 by 4 sorted cards
z170 was the same h2 70 is the same as
h1 70 which is a single 16 lane
assignment now here's the thing talked
about this last time - there's kind of a
common misconception where if you have
these lanes or chipset PCIe lanes in the
case of z2 70 that's 24 of them then
that's more lanes you can put to the GPU
that's not really correct technically
these lanes can be peeled off for PCIe
slots and they're kind of meant to be in
some cases but they're more
general-purpose PCIe lanes so therefore
things like a by for m2 device whether
it's through an AIC ed and card AIC or
other means direct means nvme devices
things like that is where you'd be
peeling those lanes off because they're
generally not more than by 2 or by 4 X 2
or X 4 with the GPU support for NVIDIA
devices at least with multi-gpu they SLI
requires by 8 as the minimum so that's 8
lanes assigned minimally for all the GPS
in the system that means if you've got a
by 4 GPU in there it's not going to work
with SLI with NVIDIA setup now you could
run by 4 with crossfire not necessarily
well but you could do it so these lanes
aren't really meant to be used for GPUs
that's kind of putting that out there to
make that clear the CPU itself is more
responsible for that side of things
that one's KB Lake is sort of launching
that's more responsible for it the rest
is general purpose though the chipset
does have some dictation some control
over what the multi-gpu set up support
is ultimately even though those general
purpose lanes aren't really used for it
next thing of course overclocking is the
same as always e2 70 lives overclocking
h2 70 does not very simple just like the
previous platform memory channels 2
channels again dual channel and a total
of up to four sticks of RAM for the seat
17 HT so any platforms with two dimms
per channel
the next specs I suppose just really be
all i/o so going to run through them
quickly here native SATA 3 ports you've
got six across the board until h1 10 max
euwe has B ports 14 across the board
until b1 52h 110 max USB 310 Anzhi 270
and 8 on h2 70 and into srt is supported
on most of these raid supported on both
of these new chipsets and independent
display support is also three for each
device and that's through the IGP
another note here is e 2 7 you can
support 3 m dot 2 devices on the
motherboard so that's new sort of H 270
supports two of them in by four
configurations Z 270 supports three of
them in by four configurations that will
enable your faster SSDs and that's the
problem obviously with SATA as the world
moves away from SATA we're going to see
more m2 we're going to see a more PCIe
or nvme enabled devices because SATA is
a big bottleneck for us in the SSD space
we're hitting that wall where the
interface is now the problem not the
device and that's not what you want so
this is moving away from that sort of
tentatively we're not there yet but
we'll be there eventually these four
SSDs that are kind of primary drives
other than this there's not a lot of
difference these are mostly the same as
the previous generation chipset a lot of
the specs are the same there's
technically obtained support for z2 17
HD 70 that's kind of exciting I suppose
but a lot of it's the same so if you
already know about the previous chipsets
you pretty much know about these ones
it's not a lot to learn other than more
HS io lanes
and some differences in terms of the
obtained support and stuff like that
depend on which platform you're looking
at so that is all for this time as
always links in the description below
for more information there will be an
article on this with the table that I
used here there's our patreon link of
the postal video to help us out directly
subscribe for more I'll see you all next
time
