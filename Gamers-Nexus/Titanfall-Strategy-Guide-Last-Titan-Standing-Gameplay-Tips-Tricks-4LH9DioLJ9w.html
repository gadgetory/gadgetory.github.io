nexus dotnet and today we're talking
about strategy in titanfall specifically
the last Titan standing game mode last
item standing is a 6v6 titans only game
mode where the only time you'll see a
pilot is if they ejected from their
Titan for the most part it's basically a
giant game of Rock'em Sock'em robots
involving rockets and nukes so it's a
bit more interesting that given that
everyone starts in a Titan and fights
Titans almost exclusively in this game
mode strategy and load out straight a
bit from what we find in domination and
attrition or team deathmatch before i
get started keep in mind the game is
currently in beta if you're watching
this after the beta has been out and the
full game is coming all of this will
have changed because there will be
entirely new loadout options so based on
what we know so far this this video kind
of shows a couple of key strategic
elements of last night and standing and
I've written a highly detailed three
thousand words strategy guide linked
below that goes way more in-depth so hit
that immediate let's start with basic
load out information beginning with
primary weapons and then move into team
tactics and advanced tactics each weapon
has different implementations we've got
a 40 millimeter cannon a chain gun and a
quad rocket launcher that can be
equipped with rapid single fire rockets
at range the 40 millimeter cannon is the
absolute undisputed best I don't even
use the rocket launcher or the Chengguan
when fighting long-range battles a good
example of this is when taking to Angel
cities fields or fractures canyons more
so angel city though you'll want the 40
millimeter cannon and both of these
positions in order to properly hold
against enemy advances the cannon deals
high damage at a slow rate of fire but
it's incredibly accurate when compared
against the other two options and it has
a slight arc so you can volley it just a
little bit over the low walls that you
can hide behind in the field quad
Rockets won't even hit by the time it
reaches your target at long range so
just don't bother and try to try to
change your tight
based on where you're going on the map
if you're covering the field or another
long-range location like down street
towards the bridge stick to the cannon
quad rockets and the rapid fire
attachment do incredibly well when in
close combat and they also tend to be
more reliable and and enable aggressive
pushes from you against the other
players if you can go streets in Angel
City and or flank the canyon on fracture
obviously before the enemy team you can
properly cover it if you're that quick
you'll do well with quad rockets because
of their high damage and their close
range effectiveness the chain got
intends to do really well in tight
combat scenarios with multiple targets
it's most at home when your team is
pushing really hard like when you're
doing a new crush which I'll discuss in
a minute and you can drill down the
enemy shields on their Titans and you
can use the chain gun to prevent their
shields from recharging while your
allies tear it into the hole with
rockets or cannon round so the chain gun
is awesome for keeping shields from
recharging but it does deal
significantly less damage than our other
two options you do get a better ability
to aim for the head though and close
like mid range scenarios with the chain
guns that does do quite a bit more
damage than that in that scenario next
we've got ordinances both work well here
the targeted rocket barrage is much
easier for the enemy to block with a
shield keep that in mind but also works
very well at long range and when the
enemy is retreating the Rockets salvo
works extremely well if you're pushing
and getting into another Titans face
like in melee combat as it can unleash
several rockets and do high damage
before the enemy can even respond with
the shield especially when at such close
range really either choice works well
just take targeted rockets for longer
range in salvo for more aggressive
builds then we have kits first off just
drop Auto eject all together get rid of
it it has absolutely no purpose here
last Titans standing is about knowing
when you should push the limits of your
dooms Titan and when you should deject
early auto eject only messes with
flow so you're better off taking
survivor instead it'll give far more
staying power remember that every shot
count in this game mode so an extra few
seconds to assist your team could be
enough to fire off one final ordnance
barrage or round of ammo before ejecting
and that's that's really the key thing
here is to stick around as long as
possible next we've got a choice between
regen and nuclear ejection at first
glance regen appears best because of its
ability again to further enhance stay in
power but nuclear ejection combos
extremely well with a new crush strategy
we've discovered and I'll talk about in
a second you should create at least one
kit with nuclear ejection keep in mind
that nukes are generally very easy to
dodge unless you rush properly so regen
does tend to work better if you're
playing at a longer range or are less
aggressive finally we have a choice
between electric smoke and vortex shield
for the tactical ability the shield sees
heavy use in last Titans standing for a
few reasons and it can do a few cool
things in combat first off because
pilots are scarce electric smokes
primary use is actually going to be for
concealed escape rather than for killing
pilots at most only one team member
should be using electric smoke it does
have its uses but shield will generally
perform much better it's not a bad idea
for one team member to hang on to it
though the best way to use shield is to
wait until your opponent has their own
up for instance if you've just fired an
entire volley of ordinances and primary
rounds into the enemy and they've popped
their shield you can approach to gain
ground on them then throw your own
shield online and absorb the return of
your volley so this is your own mo
coming back at you now you're grabbing
it so you're following me this means
that you're now holding onto your own
ammo in a vortex shield that has been
returned to you and now you're going to
release the shield to fire it straight
back at them that hopefully you've gains
ground and advanced on them in this time
which if you're safe to advanced is
important because it makes it much
harder to dodge when you return the
return so your enemy won't be able to
shield against it because they've
already exhausted their shield and
basically you you just you always want
to be the second person to trigger your
shield when possible let's say this
tactic is used against you though here's
the scenario that
me just fired a barrage of warheads into
your shield and then proceeds to put
their own shield online so you know
what's going to happen they're going to
return your volley straight back at you
if you firing so the best thing to do
here is to look away and fire the round
elsewhere like a wall and if you've got
a close team having another allied
dighton step in front of you with their
own shield will keep the chain going so
you can basically what happens is they
fire their rounds into your shield and
then you release the shield fire them
back at them they pop their shield fire
them back at you and then a teammate
steps in front of you grabs it and does
the final return volley so that's kind
of cool it has happened a few times and
it works best with a highly
communicative team now on to new
crushing the importance of rodeoing up
as a pilot shows up in the strategy and
again in a moment the new crush is very
powerful when deployed properly and as
with any type of rush the idea is to
catch them unawares while clustered in a
vulnerable position you need teammates
who will follow closely as we do in this
footage and clean up the remains of what
you've left behind the best way to pull
this off is to rush the field on Angel
City or Canon on fracture more so angel
city than fracture and on Angel City
sprint and boost down the field as
quickly as possible and try to cut into
their sidelines you want to take lots of
damage but you also need to position
yourself in between multiple Titans to
reduce their chance of escape they
should think that you're just an easy
kill the first time this is done so it
should be possible to tag enemies with
the blast getting your teammates to
engage from afar will also help distract
enemies and will force engagement while
your nuke goes off cloak immediately
upon ejection and attempt to rodeo any
remaining enemies the nuke should kill
adjacent Titans and will bring others as
low as 1 bar of whole strength in our
experience so that's enough for you to
finish them off while rodeoing or for
your allies to
them and this brings us to the next
topic the role of pilots and last Titans
standing is I mean that's that your job
is to rodeo that's your job as a pilot
you have absolutely no business using
stem in this game mode so drop it in
favor of cloak which works better
against titans on pilots anyway and
you'll also want to drop frag grenades
in favor of art grenades which display
of titans and open them up to attacks
from above again like rodeo in it is
also generally advisable to use the
archer heavy rocket instead of the
Sidewinder the Sidewinder is great at
keeping their shields down because of
its high rate of fire but the archer
allows more fire and Hyde type gameplay
which is important here a single shot
from a Titan will take you out of the
round as a pilot so try try to get a
shot off hide and then hit them from
another corner if they spent time try
and do it to track your movement they're
going to be slammed from your allied
Titans anyway so it works better for
everyone if they're if they're worrying
about that use the time reloading to
relocate also keep in mind that electric
smoke is very rare in this game mode
because of its substandard use the smoke
is best used as a smoke grenade rather
than a pilot killing device since pilots
are rarer so everyone runs shields right
now anyway this means it's pretty
difficult for Titans to get rid of rodeo
in pilots part of your job as a pilot is
to call out where enemy Titans are when
you're when you're on foot so try to
position yourself above the streets on
Angel City and on the big fracking
object will call it on fracture and you
can see almost everything on the map
from the position i'm showing right now
these are like cell phone towers or
something on Angel City you can hit them
at the peak of your ejection arch so try
to do that generally they won't find you
except in this instance where I was shot
in the face with the 40 millimeter round
and I mean what kind of helmet doesn't
protect you from a cannon shot anyway
that's just I mean obviously I had
defective equipment so anyway it's
extremely dangerous to disembark and
last Titan standing that tends to be a
poor method of dealing with rodeoing
pilots your best bet if rodeoed would be
to recruit fellow Titans to shoot the
pilot but that may be hard a secondary
option is to boost around the corner
disembark and position yourself
to take out the pilot or intentionally
put yourself in front of allied shots
friendly fire does not exist so it'll
kill the pilot on you generally it's
best not to beep rodeoed in the first
place though keep eyes on pilots and on
your radar to avoid going through parts
of the city that would allow them to
easily jump on you and remember it's
your job to kill Titans not pilots so
you can ignore them and move elsewhere
on the map so the last thing I want to
say is remember to use your burn cards
hit the link below for more on that and

tactics you employ share them in the
