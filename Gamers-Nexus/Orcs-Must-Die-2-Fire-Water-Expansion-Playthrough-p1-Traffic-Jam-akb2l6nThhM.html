to stata net and I am joined here by dr.
gone what's up dr. God God if you guys
could actually hear Steve clap every
time the video starts is so awesome
don't tell them our secrets man that is
top secret he'd be so happy we are
playing orcs must die 2 again and this
is the fire and water expansion there
are three new levels and three new traps
i believe so let's go ahead and jump
into the first level which is called
what dr. gone graphic jind indii edited
15 that is the noise that a traffic jam
makes no that is that is my copyright
little song for every level oh oh well I
better make sure I better make sure I
get the rights to that before we publish
this video um if it ever has rights I
mean it's in a human it's in a person or
an animal I don't know why it would have
rights I I'll be sure and tell YouTube's
lawyers that okay so let's see I'm the
spitter thing we got dirt spitter yes I
suppose I should also choose traps
that's probably a good idea so here are
the new traps for those of you watching
we have dart spitters which spit darts
they are ceiling mounted traps the darts
are filled with acid which is a pretty
nice prize for the works we have floor
portals that teleport them back to the
beginning of the level i believe and
then web spinners which spray webs from
the walls so i have actually not used
any of these as our first time playing
with it i'm going to grab the portal and
web spinner dr. gone you took the
devastators supposedly yes needed it
they look pretty cool I don't think you
do a lot of damage I'm not sure what
will combo the best with these I know
that the fire burns webs off fire burns
webs of yep well get fire on me oh my
god on fire elementals and
I think that's the it yeah good idea
haha we need help on the other one I'm
leaving let's take go for it I'll get I
got this fire Lords oh jeez haha turn it
into a chicken you're dying everywhere
am i dying I know I'm dying good time

want daddy a chicken oh god no no that's
done on a chicken um no I didn't know
what to do it yes there we go Karenni
chickens oh we got this yeah chicken
just relax delicious chickens lalalala
coming and going and coming coming
coming oh it's like all the way across
nice firewall killstreak nice morals
chicken
chickens are clearly the best additions
they're here Leo P whoa that web spider
is kind of cool actually that's a troll
this thing is not like us I missed oh my
god I missed
oh I died hey your corpses in the
ceiling yeah that was not good well it
happens those fire lanes actually look
like the looks like something from mario
64 their references I thought I thought
it would come is there no one agreed Oh
Nona I'm so I apologize apologize i
meant the super mario RPG uh super mario
super mario RPG man you're right uh-huh
let's see this Dartz better work oh that
is cool what it shoots in this huge like
radio lark meillard sound sure ya madda
potion whoa oh these guys do damage
these guys doing a lot of damage oh I
made it worse hello I've endeavors
why why does it never work out right I
need to come check out this dart spitter
it's always amusing wait what I have
their speeders yeah yeah put one thing
yeah f Cena I actually saw the exteriors
before they're really cool they throw
darts flow well yeah that was a little
bit of a bloody big Angry their fire
trap on the wall more fire it works are
you gonna go ahead you okay yep just
turn everything it's a chick holy thing
big was it now you're not right Fire
Lord God these sensors oh no okay no no
go away oh uh we just backed into each
other and I'll act to back fighting dead
burned a lot yeah don't let those
filings touch you yeah I touched me very
inappropriately oh sure show me on the
doll where the fire lane touch I do for
not doing it seems very naughty oh yeah
well hay mana potion yeah coin I'm gonna
survive it and I know this bitter you
get
yes bitter seemed really good okay I'm
staying here okay I'll go to the uh
another guy's another one of those right
you fight them off I'd these guys wow
those wall blades seem good what ways
are really good yeah it do those darling
better things aren't saying they don't
like each other ah firelands any help
now we're good okay they killed each
other nice what is this and why do I not
like it fire wings oh oh no darling ah
the fire Lords are the ones I'm worried
about I did those are obnoxious
definitely obnoxious but that's what the
polymorph rain is for no troll oh oh oh
now I'm Patrol slow Charles close no I
do not want to go against him there we
go yeah let's switch sides switch so I
can't see where it ok ladies I was
walking we do this he's gonna happen
sometimes it's okay magic there's a
support group for walking too fast I
mean this is it the tube it's called
QWOP I don't I don't want to play clock
the game is evil
I can makes me want to cry every day
that's a that's a pretty challenging day
it's pretty sad yeah it is a really
challenging him I devoted countless
hours of my life in that game campus
probably yes there they are uncountable
not a must be countable but it might not
be ours oh ho taken boom fried you know
dark know best pretty good whenever
you're on your side yeah you get very
angry though ah you know what the best
part of this expansion is tell me the
chickens can now turn into fried chicken
when they interact with fire lord what
fact fact what asterisk may not actually
be fact okay so you lied to me that's it
I believe he wasn't lying it was just an
educated guess of not really no yeah I
wondered do the floor portals trigger
for Cobalts no idea these coba I don't
know but the whole ceiling trap known to
hold our spinners I really good against
Cole blogs oh the floor portals do work
for it they cost a boatload of money
though yeah spinners are very useful by
the way yeah definitely I need better
trap selection for the next level I'm
gonna make into something big how what's
the range of the spitters can you put it
on the tall ceilings ah you believe so
yes nice i'm going to assume I get a say
just an assumption I'm not it's not
actual fact justify oh no oh no night
and this polymorph rain feels almost too
powerful yeah it is very very very very
powerful I mean I guess you lose points
because uh
oh you're not killing right chillin it
or something I don't know maybe but I
think it's way better like the end
results much better
oh I'm night though um okay Oh God ogre
is not a very good thank you use right
now faq yeah especially on the ice ogre
against a bunch of fire fire only yeah
well we learn these lessons and the hard
way at least I learned him the hard way
you pro uranium I've died many far too
many timing then the episode we did with
space actually featured many many hours
of a tempest dead that never got
published because they were so
despicable wow that is actually amazing
that's it space be good at this being a
physicist and everything you would you
would think so yeah he is pretty good
with the physics traps though I mean
even eat those oh yeah are you doing
here Eddie ah yeah that's that's don't
work it always turns into something
worse doesn't seem very very very fun
but I still killing you please respond
I'm please it's fun Oh

I apologize in advance I had to pick the
further I was oh oh well I think we're
both in trouble

anybody got through wait now we'll lose
points cause of death yeah oh yeah we've
lost six but well write your plumber
fring does not like you does it no oh my
god it does not like me either oh that's
much better success success I was
successful a little bit asus add a
little bit successful final never hurt
anyone we're in our final wave already
nice i'm gonna put this down and just
walk away I don't even know what to put
down traps I suppose I did those
firewalls are so good yeah they seem
like it
I just prefer my name is Yuri written
degrade I need to get traps that don't
involve fire this gives everything my
daughter yeah yeah haha we're further
Lords let's put fire traps it made sense
of the time you fight fire with fire hey
uh polymorph rain bad
that is one nasty looking Fire Lord I
sends anger in these fire Lords yes they
should really work on that yeah um yeah
we might have a problem here convert it
yeah okay huh I just need here is just
need to train fire Lords I'm almost not
exaggerating ha ha hey busier with 10
you have more than one okay this is not
very nice yes okay check we got this oh
true north oh oh oh no I dad again dad

the heck me it just it just turned into
a mountain troll three times what
YouTube as my witness it just turned
into a mountain troll three times in a
row we just start getting wow we failed
hard no man that was clearly a flawless
victory okay little bit is not a
flawless victory because if it is ok I
know I know what I must do I wish I was
not die well okay okay face I JP ok
purchase yes I can freeze people with my
dad's now oh cool that seems like a good
trap seems like a good trip yet I get
something on this guy somebody's talking
