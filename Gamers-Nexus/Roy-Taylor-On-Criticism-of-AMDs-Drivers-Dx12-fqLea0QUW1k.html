dotnet and i'm joined by Roy Taylor who
is the corporate vice president of
content alliances on Villar at AMD Roy
how's it going fantastic before we get
into that though all this coverage from
GDC 2016 is brought to you by raw
furious platformer game goner which you
see on screen now so why why is it going
so well tonight whoa we were here for
capsaicin this sort of secret event that
people were talking about online what's
the deal you know what were you on stage
talking about well the deal is we wanted
to host the GDC s largest ever event and
we wanted to surprise people you know if
I think for people are starting to get a
sense the AMD isn't coming back they
were doing some new and original stuff
and so we wanted a package all of that
up in one go and share with people just
how much we're doing we had so many
people want to come today you know we
could have had a much larger venue but
it was hard to do so we're really
excited that energy here is just amazing
there's so many people here we had so
many guest speakers and there's just so
much really cool stuff going on so man
yeah I'm just probably fantastic so some
of the guest speakers talked about dx12
it's obviously big yet a lot of ER and
then we've got a new there's the Radeon
pro duo go home that we can talk about
as well let's start with dx12 yeah so
one of the big things here was dx12 some
of the developers on stage we're talking
about that and what sort of the the
thing for AMD in terms of you've seen
all this asynchronous compute stuff
going on and some of our viewers asked
why are we being so successful well I
your words not mine some of our viewers
have asked why the numbers look the way
they do in the gaming benchmarks with
ashes and other game well it's not my
words is data means facts I mean you
can't argue with facts and the facts are
that's so far you know we're showing a
very clear lead so it's not your word of
my word its data guys and the reason is
is that we were very fortunate one of
our GPU architects are asking one of the
most important GPU architects it's a
very nice man called Mike mentor and
Mike had the very farsighted using to
see that at some point in the future we
will want to use the GPU
two different things at the same time
and unless you do something different
than what happens is as those different
things get queued up then you end up
with kind of traffic jam just to keep it
simple and so if you could effectively
put a traffic cop onto the chip then you
would find a way to do different things
at the same time without collisions and
that's a synchronous compute and so we
have on a chip real gates hardware is
it's not something you can fix with
drivers and so those gates the hardware
that we have on our chip gives us a
massive advantage in intuitive 12 and
also Vulcan so you're going to see
similar things similar results in Vulcan
as well right and one of the things
sorted to mention we talked to chris
Roberts from the star citizen team of
course and something he brought up was
with DirectX 12 it's still sort of
somewhat a waiting game because the
developers have to actually do some work
at the ground level to get it working
can you give any kind of overview what
is it that developers have to keep in
mind when building for these new AP is
well direct a stroke is very very
powerful I mean you can use a little
part of it but for best effect you got
to use all of it and it does require a
little bit of a fresh fresh approach and
it does require some work that's kind of
the bad news the good news is when you
put the work in the the jump in
performance is so dramatic and it's such
a great API you can do things you maybe
you couldn't have done otherwise of
course if you are far along in your
direct x 11 development and then you're
going to kind of swap over that's going
to create some challenges the exciting
thing the thing that has me as a gamer
and I game at war I mean I've done over
700 hours in battlefield 4 the exciting
thing is is what's going to happen when
people are taking advantage Direct X 12
from the ground up then we're and then
we're really going to see some cool
stuff do you have any sort of visibility
or perception of the timeline for dx12
as these games start fully integrating
obviously this has been a really big
year for DX 12 so far and we've just
gotten started but what's sort of the
how far should people be looking forward
to for proper full dx12 integration what
I think is here I'm gonna do I mean you
know you just saw ashes you just all hit
man we announced here at the event at
capes a sin that Creative Assembly
again a long show warhammer total war in
directx 12 you don't have to wait I mean
make your make your purchasing decision
now based on or your upgrade based on
droid says 12 right now because it's
here let's move on to VR so like we were
saying VR is a big topic here what was
the the main thing you were talking out
on stage with VR today yeah you know a
couple of things had to deliver the
first is that VR is real for some image
your yarn I guess I see audience is
young but for some of some of us oldies
we remember the VR came out in the 1980s
and it came in the 1990s so there may be
some degree of cynicism and so that my
first message was don't be cynical
there's so much energy going into V are
so many startup so much companies
billions of dollars and really talented
people working on it but they're not
going to just stop working the other
thing I talked about was something
really really interest him which is this
is the games developer conference we're
here at GDC but actually some people
here that are not from the games
industry they're from Hollywood and what
we've seen is is Hollywood has embraced
we are incredibly we saw the paranormal
activity VR experience from VR works for
working together with our parent primary
on pictures we've seen Jurassic Park
we've seen the interstellar VR
experience and actually one of the
greatest VR experiences so far is the
Martian from 20th century fox which was
put together by the VR company what's
really fantastic about this is it's an
entire new community previously these
companies were doing things like
pre-visualization project production
work and now the working on we are so
our community just got bigger and these
are your experiences of like popular
great movies so we've got games and now
we got movies one of the cool things we
saw was the stool on had said yeah with
the had an AMD was an APU Chris APU yes
so what's what's in there exactly an IP
you like I can't say exactly
FX 81 of 8000 series ap is for his oh
but yeah the idea was there's a fall
system contained in the actual head so
yeah right you know what one of the
things that people forget or we don't
say enough is we're powering all of the
consoles you know we're going to power
eighty-three percent of all tethered VR
this year so that's a pretty big number
and we don't I think we don't say enough
about the fact that we are in the
consoles and it is a big deal so soon on
look to what we did together we went
with Xbox and with sunny and said well
if they can do that then they can help
us so we work together with them with
the apu to put into their headset then
finally I want to talk a bit about the
Radeon the new radeon pro duo or do a
pro what's correct me on the radio ready
on pro duo pro duo thank you so what's
the deal with that we've seen the main
gearbox what's what's inside it's a has
a radeon pro duo which is two of our
high-end fury GPUs together on a single
card so when you look at it and i don't
if you filmed of you should go film it
it looks like in a more graphics card
and we can do that because of hpm
because the hpm we can put those two
together and a rip and a regular form
factor so it's not like a really really
big card and we can deliver 16 teraflops
of performance now liquid vr supports
multi-gpu in the valve out aperture test
you can use multi-gpu from AMD with
radeon and that's important because what
we want to be able to do is want to be
the load into a scene everything a
storyteller what's to put into it so we
created this product for two purposes
one for the VR content creation industry
so people who want to make either
experiences using a combination of 360
video and game engines or just game
engines and two for power users it just
want the very very best like you get
their hands on so this card liquid cord
like the previous fury chips are the
Fiji chips the one that's in the main
gear is liquid called very cool so any
any final thoughts closing thoughts here
that you'd like to say to people get
them excited about what you're working
on yeah you know drivers for a long time
people get saying why AMD is great
hardware what about our drivers
I don't want to hear that anymore all
right look we're well class drivers
fantastic drivers drivers are power the
mac drivers of power aeroplanes
industrial applications we are really
really good drivers and ours were the
ones that like try to burn peoples of
machines down recently so we have great
drivers today and I'm proud of our
driver team and if you think this new
AMD is cool you ain't seen nothing
coming very cool Thank You Roy if you

next time we could he said next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
