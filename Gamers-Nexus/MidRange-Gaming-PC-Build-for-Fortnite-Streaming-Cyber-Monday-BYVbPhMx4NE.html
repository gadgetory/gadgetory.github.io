is one of the most popular games right
now and so we decided we would put
together a machine for a relatively low
budget seven hundred seven hundred fifty
dollars have been on the sales of the
day and see if we could make something
both capable of streaming and playing
fortnight simultaneously so to add some
value to our benchmarks we've got some
additional testing on stream throughput
so we're looking at viewer side
performance what's the experience the
viewer gets and then streamer side
performance what is their frame rate as
they are playing and streaming
simultaneously and this is our machine
we threw together for it using solve the
current Black Friday or Cyber Monday
sales and most of those should be
ongoing will link the parts below if you
want to follow along with this build
before that this video is brought to you
by us and the just buy it code unlike
real time ray tracing our merch actually
exists to commemorate the most memorable
quote of the year and also Black Friday
but mostly the first thing everything in
the GM store is 10% off with a discount
code just buy it at checkout that
includes our most popular item the
critically acclaimed GN mod mats our
shirts ceramic coffee mugs and GPU
component posters and everything else as
a bonus this is also a great way to
support jion's work the code last
through November 26th go to store doc
gamers access dotnet or click the link
below so the problem with PC builds is
everybody always post their list that
they know is absolutely superior and
it's something that happens a lot
because everyone in the audience for the
most part has built a computer and so
you get this general feeling of
superiority because you can put together
a system of similar respect for cheaper
but the point here today is that we had
all these parts we validated them all
we've worked with them all and we trust
them to be not garbage so the build then
comes out with the gtx 1066 gigabyte SC
cards about the cheapest 1060 you can
get yeah that's the name of it 1060 too
much 20 series lately
it is a 1060 it's not a 2060 it's a 1066
gigabyte card so it's about 200 bucks
after the rebate sometimes a little
cheaper or sometimes a little more it
kind of fluctuates and then the CPU is
an r5 2600 which we awarded our best
overall value award for this year out of
all the CPUs 160 bucks makes it a very
good buy and at 6 cores and 12
threads it's actually a pretty capable
CPU for lower quality streaming not low
quality but lower you can stream with
h.264 very fast which is acceptable very
fast as the name of the encoding preset
it's fine it's a good one for someone
who's really just starting out not
really making any money on streaming
just kind of interested in it and then
you've got options of course with AM for
to go with Rison seven instead if you
did want that extra Headroom for
streaming but we would recommend a
better motherboard for that than what
we've chosen we've chosen a gigabyte or
aspro motherboard technically or as pro
Wi-Fi it's what we had it's about a
hundred bucks right now speaking with
build Zoid we've decided that this board
has a good enough erm for six core to be
usable in this configuration now it's a
bit limited you can't really overclock
too much with this board it's $100 what
do you expect but it does a good enough
job you can set an all core frequency a
bit higher than stock and then depending
on how the voltage and the CPU bin work
out it might go a bit higher on some
CPUs than others so for what you get
it's a pretty good board the vrm is fine
it's not exciting it's not bad it's just
okay if you wanted to upgrade a bit we
have an m4 video coming out by builds
I'd with narration of the best boards
and different price brackets if you're
curious for memory we have two sticks of
Corsair Vengeance lpx 3000 megahertz
it's two by four gigabytes so eight
total CL 15 it's pretty good times
actually and the board and the memory
work well together that's important you
don't want to play with tertiary
secondary timings all day these work
fine has an XMPP profile built-in pre
pre tuned for you and the power supply
is an EVGA 450 watt power supply which
actually works out really well because
as you'll see in our testing total
system power consumptions about 200 230
watts depend on what you're doing so
let's go through the parts choices and
more depth some of our benchmarks and
then we'll talk conclusions about what
to make of all of this data on about us
700 $750 PC build for the CPU we're
using the r5 2600 we recently gave the
CPU our annual award for best overall
value which it receives for a new price
point of $160 or thereabouts and
versatility in gaming streaming and some
lightweight production applications
Intel
does compete with AMD and fiercely so
but simply not at this price point this
generation if you wanted a last gen
product the r7 1700 X can be had for
around 170 to 180 dollars although we'd
recommend a better motherboard with a
stronger vrm to support those extra two
cores it will matter on those CPUs
Fortnight could be played on a cheaper
cpu but the idea here is that you get a
mid-range PC capable of a few other
things in addition to just fortnight for
example lower quality streaming still
viewable enough and decent for a starter
is possible on the r5 2600 with some
tuning as is it gaming a while streaming
on the same system for fortnight
performance without any active streaming
we found the r5 2600 stock CPU and GTX
1066 a gigabyte GPU combination to
output a framerate average in 126 fps
once at the 1080p high this ties our
1440p high results with the same
components and indicates that we're
starting to bottleneck on the cpu at
1080p epoch we could sustain 88 FPS
average was just completely playable
it's just bound to 1080p at this point
at 1440p and epic were just below 60 fps
a mix of high and epic settings could be
used to sustain in the 60s and 70s for
frame rate if desired although the game
is more about fluid frame throughput
than it is about graphics quality to be
honest with an active stream we found
that faster h.264 encoding settings at
10 megabits per second were just too
abusive leading to our YouTube stream
output suffering as you can see on the
screen we're dropping frames here the
viewer site experience resulted in those
dropped frames which is a poor
experience for the viewer that means
you're never gonna get any traction as a
streamer streamer side experience and
playback is perfectly acceptable but
it's more important to have consistently
good viewer side playback with minimal
drops frames
reducing our quality settings to 1080p
and high for the game setting a 120 FPS
cap for the game which is about the max
anyway and configuring OBS to encode
with the still acceptable very fast
h.264 preset we found that we had a
decent stream going that was perfectly
viewable by the viewer on the other end
of youtube we use twitch style settings
here the very fast encoding preset and
megabit per second bitrate yielded a
100% encode frame throughput on the cpu
we did end up dropping some frames about
10% of them from rendering stalls
unfortunately this leads to an average
FPS of 54 instead of 64 the viewer but
that can still be resolved with a mild
overclock or some more settings tweaking
this is completely acceptable as a
streaming machine for fortnight if using
these settings and we'd strongly
encourage overclock in the CPU the 3.9
gigahertz are higher as that resolve any
dropped frames at higher settings while
a mild GPU overclock would resolve those
rendering stalls none of this is
difficult to do and we have plenty of
guides on how to do it if you do want to
overclock the CPU we did encourage
getting an aftermarket cooler the stock
cooler is perfectly fine for stock
settings it works well enough especially
the H 500 case which is decent overall
for cooling stock it's just that once
you start overclocking and pushing more
volts you will need some additional
cooling power we have a few cooler
alternatives linked in the article below
and in the description below if you'd
like to check one of those out while
you're buying the rest of the parts for
this PC just to give you some
overclocking the Headroom thermally the
GPU is next the EVGA SC gtx 1066
gigabyte was selected for the GPU as
it's available between 200 and 220
dollars depending on the sales that are
live when you check this video list
price is closer to 240 or 250 but it's
regularly marked down right now and
there's a pretty good deal you can check
again the links below to find the most
up-to-date price to go through the same
benchmarks or a couple of additional
benchmarks actually here's how the gtx
1060 and r5 2600 combination perform in
our standard cpu review test suite at
1080p and high settings our system runs
f1 2018 at 120 FPS average was 1% lows
at 59 fps across multiple passes 0.1%
lows always drag in this specific game
but it's not dismal it's just what it
normally does this isn't bad for an r5
2600 and gtx 1066 gigabyte combination
with both devices fully stock no
overclocking here far cry 5 at normal
settings and 1080p operates at 82 FPS
average with it lows tightly behind at
62 FPS and 55 FPS this 1% low frame rate
performance for frame time performance
is indicative of an overall consistent
framed
every time and we don't see any stutters
during gameplay that's really what we're
going for here especially for a
mid-range build GTA 5 under very high
and ultra settings effectively max
except we're using FXAA and no advanced
graphics options runs at 98 FPS average
and 63 FPS for the 1% lows this is
strong performance for GTA 5 putting us
just near 100 FPS average that is and
perfectly acceptable for our build
finally total war at war hammers a CPU
intensive title and under high settings
it's again pretty abusive on the CPU but
we still manage over 100 FPS in this RTS
and grand strategy game which is
completely acceptable once again 1440p
is also fairly playable if you wanted to
capitalize on the recent price
reductions in 1440p monitors and will
link one of those below as well
we're at 80 FPS average for the f1 2018
55 FPS average for far cry 5 with normal
settings and 72 FPS average for GTA 5
under nearly maxed settings this is
completely playable at 1440p and 1080p
alike although 1080p allows for more
Headroom for graphics setting increases
and we showed fortnight earlier that one
does struggle a bit at epic settings
you'd want to go down too high for 1440p
with fortnight memory has finally come
down a bit in price and is fortunately
unimpacted by the impending tariff hike
on January 1st for memory we chose the
$75 kit of Corsair 3000 Deckard's lpx
Vengeance Ram CL 15 and elected to just
run it at XMP the CL 15 timings are good
overall and don't require any manual
tweaking on the gigabyte pro motherboard
that we're using you can find other 3000
megahertz kits for around 70 bucks or
even a bit cheaper but we've previously
validated that this kit works well with
the gigabyte p450 ARS pro and that's
what we're using so we chose to stick
with what we know works because we know
it works and why fight with memory if
you don't have to it's an extra five to
ten dollars over some team memory for
example but that's not going to break
the bank and it works again so it's easy
to put in and just use you'll want to
avoid the 20 400 megahertz kits that may
tempt you at $60 because the speed
difference is actually tangible in many
use cases with Rison and we've
previously demonstrated that and I rise
in 2000 series release content if your
cure
to see why and how much it can affect
performance we gave NZXT an award for
its age 500 this year which manages to
reform surprisingly well with its
completely negative pressure
configuration NZXT sh 500 has the
biggest contributions in quality of life
and ease of installation features which
make it trivial to work with and easy to
make a good looking system and a
relatively small ATX tower case kill
management has predefined paths laid out
making it easy for a new builder to make
sure the backside of the system is also
tidy and the pre-installed fans are
actually pretty good dust filters are
also pre-installed where they'd make
sense for a negative pressure system so
just make sure you maintain them and it
should be good to go at roughly $70 this
one is a good buy for a mid-range gaming
PC like what we're building today if you
wanted to spend less though and allocate
some money elsewhere although it's
getting old and stale the Corsair 270 R
is still a good deal it's just again
it's a bit old but it's a case so they
don't really change that much over the
years it's about $40 with rebates these
days and we've been recommending it
going on three years now in november
content actually almost almost like an
annual trend at this point it's one of
the better ones at the price we do
prefer the aged 500 but that price
difference it may matter for some of you
and if it does the 270 R is a good
alternative cooling is acceptable in
this one and can be easily expanded on
and that's also true for the 270 R for
the power supply will use the EVGA 450
watt BT 80 plus bronze PSU this isn't
non-modular but its power rating is
perfect for our system if you're
concerned that 450 Watts doesn't sound
like enough we ran some total system
power consumption tests and found the
following under a heavy workload for
this system of fortnight with live
encoding via OBS we measured a power
consumption at an average peak of 230
watts with non streams fortnight
gameplay at 200 watts blender on the CPU
only ran 140 watts and GTA 5 ran 200
watts with total war at 205 watts a 450
watt power supply then is just about
perfect as it puts us right at the peak
efficiency point in the efficiency curve
this one is currently about $40 after
discounts making it good for our lower
tier two mid-range system if you wanted
to step it up to something a bit higher
quality
the supernova also an EVGA power supply
at 750 watts and modeled g1 plus is
currently on sale for 60 dogs it's about
20 more but that discount ends in a few
days so keep that in mind it's an 80
plus gold unit it is better but it's
also completely overkill just for the
record for the system and for the
motherboard we chose the gigabyte be 450
Pro Wi-Fi this choice was entirely
dictated by what we had available and
what we've tested as you'll see in our
upcoming best I am for roundup buy
builds I'd we'd actually prefer
something similar to the B 450 tomahawk
for an affordable low-end board with an
8 core CPU but the B 450 Pro saves us
some money as vrm is still completely
sufficient for six core CPU that's also
with build Zoids validation on that fact
if you do jump on one of the r7 instead
of the r5 we would recommend upgrading
the motherboard for something with a
stronger vrm to better handle the
thermal requirements of an 8 core
especially with overclocking the B 450
Pro is about $100 right now making it a
good financial fit for the build and
plenty capable for what we're working
with ok then so now that we've tested
things we would improve or consider
improving if you're building something
like this Thor 5 2600 is still a great
deal it does become a bit limited and it
will become more limited in games that
are more CPU intensive so things you can
do you can either upgrade to an r7 if
you are genuinely trying to stream
because this build remember it's
possible to play fortnight for way
cheaper you don't need to go this you
barely need really much of anything to
play fortnight at reasonable settings so
you can go away cheaper than this but
that's not the point the point is that
this can also stream the game while
playing it so there's some versatility
there you get it's a mid-range build
depending your definition of that and as
a mid-range build it also has
capabilities to do things like
lightweight production tasks maybe you
want to cut some clips together of
playing the game with your friends this
is completely capable of doing that
without slowing things down you've got
CUDA acceleration for premiere you have
a decent CPU so it's good all around her
but our seven would be a decent
consideration if you did that you would
want to go with a better motherboard
check our best am 4 motherboards video
for suggestions on those you could
further tune the software side of things
to get stuff working a bit better if you
want the stream to be improved quality
so options would be overclocking the GPU
it's trivial you can do it in a couple
minutes and stress tested over an hour
to dial the settings you'll be good to
go that would help with some of those
dropped render some of the the render
stalls that we saw in our stream viewer
side testing where we were at 92%
delivery instead of a hundred so that
would help their CPU it's worth
considering a bit of an overclock you
can't get a ton out of this motherboard
but you can get a little bit so 3.9 4.0
gigahertz should be achievable on most
CPUs and then if you run into some
thermal issues there which is definitely
possible depending on the volt frequency
table you might end up wanting to
upgrade the cooler you can get a better
cooler for about let's call it $30 for a
pretty good one maybe 25 depending
something like the thermal take contact
12 contact silent 12 which is
effectively a hyper 212 also a decent
option although we don't really like it
these days because it's age is showing a
lot but those are both better than this
for the most part so options there if
you did want to do some overclocking you
run into thermal issues to ban your
voltage motherboards a limiter as well
but for what you get it's really not a
bad system it's just not something that
you can do a whole lot of tuning with
now in the OS you can do a lot you could
do you could do a process lasso you
could do process prioritization for OBS
you could artificially limit the
framerate this is a big one for
fortnight so if you're ok with going
down to 60fps in your game maybe you're
only outputting 60 anyway so to some
extent who cares and you're not old
you're competitive if you can limit to
60 and you don't feel terrible about it
or you can use external software and
limits to something like eighty or a
hundred that would be pretty reasonable
that gives your CPU some additional
processing Headroom to handle the stream
and that would be a good setup so you
can definitely get pretty far with this
in a start up streaming career with just
some manual tweaking and the OS and I'll
teach you a bit too and it's perfectly
capable it's not the absolute best
streaming setup to use because something
like an r7 I 709 would be easier
out-of-the-box to work with but this is
fully capable and the I sevens I should
mention if they're just eight core eight
thread like the 9700 K will also limit
you in some way
so keep that in mind too so overall the
builds fine you can pick up Vanessa
steeper I should and mechanical drive
for archival storage maybe about one or
two terabytes something like that for
relatively cheap right now as the see
prices are through the floor at the
moment and will continue to go down so
don't feel a mad rush to buy one because
they'll keep going down into 2019
especially quarter one yeah overall
we're pretty happy with the build with
its performance with its price you can
get stuff that's a bit cheaper depending
on when you check the prices and what
your priorities are but ours were a
motherboard we knew was in complete
garbage it's got a good enough erm for
some basic overclocks we wanted a video
card that had CUDA acceleration for any
sort of premiere tasks or if you did
want to push some streaming lightweight
streaming workload off to envy encoder
for example and you get both of those
with this plus the memory is a good spec
for frequency and timings and it's all
pretty configured in the board so you
don't have to do any work there and
that's it for this one so feel free to
leave your need for validation below if
you'd like to say how much better you
are than us at doing anything relating
to pcs that's what people always do with
these types of content pieces I've seen
you do it to Paul and I will continue to
do what I want so thanks for watching
