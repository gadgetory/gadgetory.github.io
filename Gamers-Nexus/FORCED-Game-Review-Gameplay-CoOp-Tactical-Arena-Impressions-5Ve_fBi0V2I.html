Nexus dotnet and today we're looking at
forced the new co-op tactical arena
combat game by beta dwarf I previously
voiced a video tutorial showcasing the
basic combat mechanics about a year ago
and that was when the game was in beta
its massively improved since then and is
officially released in full capacity as
of today and you'll find the fold
written review linked in the description
below click on that if you want some
more detailed analysis to see if the
game is really worth it for you as a
player and this supplemental video
component aims to highlight the gameplay
mechanics in more depth and give you a
bit of a visual look at how it actually
works
with the words I've written so to catch
everyone up forced is a freshly released
arena brawler style game with a couple
of unique mechanical inflections that
improve the longevity and kind of
differentiate it from all the other hack
and slash errs out on the market so to
give you a quick idea if you've played
the gauntlet series if anyone can
remember our kids from 1985 or if you're
like me and played them after it was
released the gauntlet series and
specifically gauntlet Dark Legacy kind
of give you a good idea for the top
level play of force but it's a lot
deeper than hitting things with metal
sticks right so there are abilities
involved just like most action-adventure
games these days but force is really
pretty heavily catered toward a co-op
audience just like the gauntlet games
and so the players will still have fun
just fine you'll get through the game it
is scaled for the number of players so
it won't be overly difficult you'll just
get the most out of the experience if
you're joined by a couple friends it
supports up to four simultaneous players
in campaign and survival co-op modes
there are four character classes in the
game so that does kind of fit with the
coop for player support and each class
builds off the others is abilities so
playing with at least one other gamer
will really help build the level of
tactical interaction within the arena so
here's why that is the game mechanically
boils down into a couple of key elements
first you have hitting stuff with sharp
things that's always a pretty big
element in any a brawler hack-and-slash
game
second is using abilities tactfully to
efficiently dispatch each of the unique
enemies in the game there are different
types of enemies that require or are
catered to different abilities of the
character classes and then third is
deploying the games of spirit mentor to
activate on map objects and that's the
biggest difference with forest and the
one you're probably least familiar with
if you haven't seen my previous video
but before we go off the deep end on
mechanics discussion which I will do in
a future video for force specifically
let's step back and look at a more
zoomed out view of forest the game and
who it's for so after playing it for
several hours and before giving you more
analysis I would like to say that I
think the game is most for players who
would like to sit down I'm quoting my
own review here linked below you'd like
to sit down with friends locally or
online because it does support local
cooperative play and and just basically
enjoy a simple yet tactical
hack-and-slash combat game without a
whole lot of competition it is a bit
more casual if you play it that way and
basically spend a night screwing around
with new strategies and having a good
time in some pretty challenging combat
scenarios so if if that sounds like
something you'd like or you and your
friends would like then definitely check
out forest look more into it I also
thank players who enjoy time trials and
competing on ladders online especially
solo players who like a challenge and
kind of like to pit themselves against
other players and ladders they would
probably like forests as well especially
if you favor ability based combat and
all that said there is actually an
underlying story basically I'm not going
to get too into it here but you are a
captive fighter from a tribe and you're
just being put through a series of arena
trials to prove your worth kind of like
the the slaves of the Roman Empire would
be in the Claddagh toriel arenas and the
original Colosseum so that's kind of
where they draw their inspiration it is
a pretty cool story for an indie game I
was actually impressed with it and I
thought the voice acting was very
impressive as well and in several scenes
anyway so it's not like that
cringe-worthy voice acting that a lot of
indie and
started games have it is legitimately
good and does kind of propel the game
forward and keep you interested
soundtrack is very good and the art as
you can see on the screen isn't exactly
technically advanced in terms of it
doesn't have high poly models and crazy
stuff like that so it is pretty
accessible to different pcs you'll
probably be able to play it on intel HD
4000 IGP is absolutely no problem you
play it on AP users absolutely no
problem and the aesthetic though that's
the important part the aesthetic the
overall cohesiveness of the visuals is
very good I think it's pretty pleasing
to the eyes it's not too stylized and
it's it's not like borderline cartoony
but it isn't taking itself too seriously
either let's jump back to gameplay for a
second now that we've covered the basics
and who the game is targeted for so
gameplay it specifically with multiple
players in co-op mode is centered around
calling ball fits around the map and
activating different objects these
cannot be activated by the players so
you have to actually physically fly the
spirit mentor through these objects thus
activating deactivating or destroying
them and this is really where game
played deviates from the standard hack
and slash arena brawlers
so other than ball fits flying through
things as you can see on the screen
constantly through this video you also
can mark enemies and this is done simply
by hitting them just like in D&amp;amp;D fourth
edition you can mark them as you apply
marks your abilities and your friends
abilities will do extra damage or have
additional side effects to the enemies
so this creates a new layer of dev with
strategy so it suddenly becomes very
important which enemy you're hitting you
don't just like spam all your abilities
like in a lot of these other games
because that won't work
so just spam clicking and spam slamming
the ability buttons it's not advisable
it actually does take a bit of thought
and tactics to effectively dispatch
these opponents before they swarm you
and that is why
happen to this game if you don't take
them out efficiently then you will get
outnumbered and taken down and and
ultimately the boss battles are actually
very challenging the game itself is
pretty challenging even the puzzles
which for the most part we're not to
mentally straining did get a bit more
difficult as the game progresses in in
level here so I think it's pretty solid
overall his game the mechanics are very
fluid it's mechanically intuitive so
it's very pick up and play but a lot of
extra depth there as well it's a good
game for having a couple friends over I
do have trouble with a couple of things
though so for example I think the
information conveyance could be a bit
better there there is a bit of an issue
with new players when I was observing
people play where they have trouble
locating their own character in the mess
of chaos and all the combat in the arena
so that can be pretty pretty difficult
to keep playing when you can't even find
your own character and other than that
there were a couple camera angle issues
and boss battles where right when we
were getting cornered and really needed
the camera to work properly it would get
thrown through a cliff or something and
obstruct our view so that is an issue I
think the developers can work on that
though these are not things that would
stop me from buying the game but it is
something I wanted to warn you all about
so keep that in mind and all be all I
think it's a great game I do think it
has a very specific audience of players
who want to kind of play with their
friends or are very competitive in a
solo environment against other people on
leaderboards kind of like trying if you
like try and you might like this if you
like gauntlet you might like this and
that's pretty much all there is to
forced so I will be giving out some keys
on Twitter and Facebook in the future
check those out go to the links in the
description below check out the full
review and let me know if you have
questions I will see you all next time
