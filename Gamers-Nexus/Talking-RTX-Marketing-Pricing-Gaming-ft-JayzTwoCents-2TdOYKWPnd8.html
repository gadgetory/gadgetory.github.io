joined by Jay from Jay's two sons how's
it going Jay good my first pax it's
everything I expected it to be Ames lots
of people and yeah what else what I mean
what did you think getting into this
what did you just come out here for fun
or what was the impetus I came out here
complete on my own dime
my own time just to kind of experience
it and do any appointments I just wanted
to come and see I've been to e3 before
we have never been to a pack so I wanted
to compare very cool so today we're
gonna be talking over the crowd about
some of the nvidia RTX stuff i think is
the plan before that this video is
brought to you by thermal grizzlies
high-end thermal paste and liquid metal
thermal grizzlies cryo knot is an
affordable high quality thermal compound
that doesn't face some of the aging
limitations of other pastes on the
market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted test by a tube at the link
in the description below there's there
was a lot of controversy at launch
especially around like well a lot of
things pricing the the rate racing demos
in general the secretive performance
figures yeah so let's start there I
guess what are your what are your
thoughts on the performance presentation
and you saw their lives team I guess
right yeah so I wasn't able to go to
Germany for Gamescom so I got to
experience it from the same consumer
perspective as everyone else which was a
unique because typically you know you go
to these events you get kind of a
different treatment than the people that
are going to be getting the information
you know through whatever media venue
they're they're doing I spent the whole
two hours waiting to see some sort of
figures they always compare it towards
the previous 80 series which we expected
but they only talked about rate racing
which to be fair they're very proud of
right they've invested 10 years worth of
time and money into the into the touring
court but at the same time it was kind
of like if you want the audience to get
hyped and you want the audience to
pre-purchase it especially if you're
talking to the gamer audience
you gonna give them some sort of a
carrot right you've got to dangle
something other than the new tech which
is exciting but in terms of just if you
are on Pascal or you let's say you're an
older architecture than Pascal and you
want to justify skipping Pascal and
going right to touring then you got to
show them something and I was really
disappointed that there was absolutely
nothing and then the charts that did
come out within the days that followed
again had no access model they had no
reference as to what the performance
gains were so it's still this this veil
of secrecy and no one knows exactly what
to expect yeah we heard a lot about ray
tracing performance specifically but I
mean as you said the ten series it's not
pretty
we all know it's not particularly
impressive outrage amazing because I
wasn't built for that
exactly so yes it's a pretty it's it's a
comparison where clearly the ten shades
will lose every time by a lot right of
course where people care about is you
know rasterization performance which is
games as we know it today so how is it
compared there and my fear is that maybe
the performance metrics and the gaps
borne as wide as we would expect which
is why they didn't really talk about
that
but on the flip side I mean maybe if
they were wider than we were we were
expecting maybe the fear is that because
they've got so much inventory to dump
you did a good piece on that maybe they
don't want people to necessarily skip
Pascal otherwise going to be sitting on
hundreds of thousands of these units not
really moving or they have to discount
them too much or there's no profit
that's so that's an interesting theory I
haven't heard yet about this and that
not showing performance could be a
potential way of encouraging more Pascal
sales to people have you seen in your
own comments to your videos mine online
saying screw it I'm just gonna go buy a
1080 a lot right which almost seems like
strategic so I mean it's it's it's a
little bit of a tin tin foil hat theory
but I think it holds water yeah yeah and
I mean on the 10 G's we know they over
ordered they had too many it's that's
out they that's known so they've got a
support partners herbs they're absorbing
that yeah so one thing I wondering is
for like the 2016 2050 are we gonna see
pascal stock that's
that's converted in name only like are
we gonna see a 1070 polled and made into
a 2050 or 2060
so Mike so think about this from a from
a buyer's perspective in terms of
confusion let's say Pascal coexists with
touring so you're gonna have a 1050 1050
ti2 1060 s possibly a 2050 a 2060 a 1070
1070 TI 1080 1080 TI 2080 20 80 TI Titan
V that is a very crowded product stack
so I mean I wouldn't be surprised if
they didn't just take let's say six gig
2060s or 10 60s and maybe 10 70s and
somehow rebrand those I would be
surprised yeah we've seen that before I
think we've seen AMD it's done a lot and
videos on it a lot so it's dead like
that been done in the past and I think I
don't know we were talking before this
about how the RT X branding my Theory's
been that it's gonna be on the high end
and then like the 10th of 2060 is gonna
be GTX and what are your thoughts on
that I can't remember where I saw it but
so if you watch the live stream then you
know that it was kind of a it was kind
of a circus it started late like 22
minutes late the the show usually it's
very choreographed where the website is
various things go live various tweets go
live in in conjunction with as Jensen is
talking about something those all went
live 20 minutes early because Jensen was
at a sink and I don't remember where I
saw it I I want to say it was actually
Ryan trout was was showing these these
web sites as they were going live I saw
one that showed the product model and it
said Archie X and GTX and I saw
specifically a 20 50 and 20 60 there but
as fast as I saw that website go online
it was taken down so I don't think they
can possibly bring r-tx
to that price point I really don't see
how they could do that yeah great Tracy
and specifically this is one of my
points and this isn't like to say
anything it's hot I'm not saying
anything bad here we're not saying
anything bad about the branding but just
to be clear but I think from a a
perverse perspective the 2060 probably
won't have the power really to drive ray
tracing the way it's 2080 but obviously
so sticking with GTX makes sense to me
that
right and I mean it's it's it's very
unlikely obviously that it will be even
a cut down version of touring I mean I
mean who knows it could be but you know
what I think is interesting that no one
has really talked about in this
discussion is everyone was expecting
some sort of HBM out of nvidia but i
feel like they kind of went the other
way where they've shown the the
conventional you know g ddr4 layout or
GD d our layout GD v r6 obviously this
time around they kind of went more with
like a stacked core design in a way
rather than stacked ram maybe maybe the
you know the the fiji and the core and
AMD's devolvement of that just kind of
showed that the gains weren't there
based on the investment and I think it's
funny that both brands kind of went two
completely different ways on how they
were gonna handle the new core
architecture but I also feel like if you
go and look at the history of the video
launching the first rasterization card
you know same discussions taking place
no one cares about rasterization pixel
shading that's a fad who cares no one
cares what the shaded shape or what
shadows look like shaders and suddenly
that's the only way we know how to game
today and it's the same discussion
taking place now but I feel like anyone
that's adopting the 2080 or 2080 TI for
the ray-tracing performance obviously is
bleeding edge early adopter very
expensive but who knows what the next
family of cards could bring in terms of
performance gains but I mean this is how
you get new technology to emerge is
somebody has to launch it and that's
exactly what we have right now and I
think people are very scared of the
price point to the performance
definitely definitely scared of the
price and on HBM and stuff like that and
the it was sort of is interesting they
were sort of forced into HBM because of
power consumption concerns and power
budget so i gay am d really benefited
from a power standpoint you save a lot
of wattage by going to HP M and they
needed that to have the budget and Vidia
really only drove it with the Titan B
and they need and the problem with Fiji
and Vega was our Fury and Vega was the
just a cost of maybe battery yeah it's
very expensive to do HBM like it's its
last I checked from a source at SK Hynix
it was about 150 bucks for 8 gigabytes
of HP m2 which is that's cost that's
like that's before the consumer base
well you know at the end of the day
though nobody needs r-tx heck nobody
even needs Pascal to be honest these are
luxury items these really are nice to
haves not need two halves and of course
we all want it and if you can't afford
it then of course it kind of kicks you
in the teeth and you and it makes you
feel mad but at the end of the day if
you have a Pascal card and it's it's
meeting your needs and you're not
planning on trying to do ray-tracing
there's really no reason to upgrade same
thing I've seen people I've seen a lot
of comments of like well I guess I'm
hanging on to my ten atti for a while
it's like yeah that's a five year card
that card is gonna last you a while
there's no reason to exchange that card
so I mean I guess if my piece of advice
to anyone watching is if your card is
doing the job now it's not gonna
suddenly not do it overnight when these
launched yeah if generally when people
ask us you probably got the same
question all the time should I upgrade
or should I wait right and my answer is
always well I are you happy with what it
does now today and if you are then who
cares and if you're not happy with it
it's holding you back you're
professional you need the rendering
power whatever then yeah upgrade like as
of right today depending on when you're
watching this but as of today it might
be worth to wait one more month because
pricing for Pascal if you're just gonna
go with the older generation and not go
r-tx can only really go down from here
it's not gonna go up so that's usually
the only time I would recommend someone
wait is if we're right on the edge of a
launch because you're gonna also see a
lot of really good use deals out there
if you buy from somebody that's
trustworthy right and we should we
should balance us out before we close
out talk about some of the good things
that we think can be coming with r-tx so
on the up side I mean from what we know
today whether it's the board partner
designs or the technology or ray-tracing
whatever what are the things that you
are the most interested in you think
have the most positive up size because
we've been talking about like the
criticism side too what's the upside
Nvidia's involvement with vulcan and
optimization for vulcan that's how
they're getting the ray-tracing
performance is doing of the Vulcan API
which is a very it's very good on
overhead I'm also really interested in
seeing how all of these different types
of AI cores and and and the other types
of architecture and the GPU is able to
handle a more very Hardware level
asynchronous compute type of workload
so I feel like the future is here in
terms of you know instead of having coup
de coeur sitting idle or whatever are
having to trade-off workload you're
gonna have so many parallel workflows
happening at the GPU level now
yeah and that's something we talked
about with the Titan V as well where
with the Titan V we saw huge
improvements in the async compute so
like Vulcan on sniper 4 did really well
dx12 titles like ash is doing really
well and I talked to anybody about that
we publicly said that the focus those
other places they typically lack behind
AMD yes definitely and Nvidia said it
when we tested it that part of their
focus for the next-gen which was named
at the time was going to be async
compute so yeah I would agree with you
that's definitely one of the biggest
upsides here and as we see drivers
mature and developers you know I I don't
know from a developer's standpoint in
terms of game development how hard it is
for them to implement this new hardware
but I mean at least we know moving
forward a hopefully the car the cards
that are not able to do this level of a
synchronous compute or parallel
workflows hopefully they won't be
hindered in some way as game development
moves on otherwise n you are talking
about the necessity to upgrade but I
still think we're gonna be at least two
or three years from it being every
triple-a title is coming out with this
card optimization in mind right and then
there's also just like hair works and
everything else over probably a toggle
just turn it off right oh yeah yeah I
would hope so
for sure could you imagine if there
wasn't we have a whole different
discussion today very different yeah any
other upside sperm on top I mean a lot
of it we won't really know until
performance testing yeah it's really
hard to say considering we're still so
in the dark so I mean obviously we'll
have this conversation again in a month
yeah it sounds good so Jay if you don't
know us from Jay's two cents on YouTube
you can check them out we'll link it
below just in case you don't know who he
is
there's a lot of really cool water
cooling content but I think everyone
knows that at this point so Jay thank
you for joining me all right thank you
appreciate it and we'll see you all next
