Emma sighs new Trident enters our bench
for the first product review of the week
the Trident is a small form-factor
gaming PC that ships in four different
SKUs one of which is bare-bones and they
range from 600 to $1,100 our review
looks at thermals power noise and gaming
performance of the $1100 unit before
getting to that this content is brought
to you by AMD and their rx 470 GPUs
which we've generally found to be the
best price to performance for their
class a video card now at the sub $200
price point you can find a link in the
description below for more information
on those MSI's trident claims to be the
smallest VR ready PC currently available
it stands on this stance so there's
obviously two modes of presenting it one
is flat kind of like the average Lenovo
office PC just like that or in the stand
that it is sort of chiseled out at the
bottom so you can't just stand it up
without the stand or it'll be bad so
that is the Trident but it's about the
size of a DVR the dimensions are 346 by
72 by 232 millimeters we'll put the
inches equivalent somewhere on the
screen if you prefer that system and the
stand makes it a little bit awkward
where it's not as comfortable for me to
have it this way if you've got pets or
maybe you have other small creatures
that might knock things over it's not
the most stable setup in the world
because there's no clamping system on
the bottom to hold it in place but it's
basically meant to be used in an HD PC
environment so you put it like that or
you put it flat and use it with your TV
is kind of the idea looking at the
ventilation of the Trident first we've
got a pretty straightforward layout the
right side panel has a large mesh intake
that covers the video card fan and that
video card is a GTX 10 63 gigabyte in
MSI model of course and uses an axial
cooler the CPU uses a small form-factor
blower fan and that exhaust hot air out
the back of the case which also helps
take care of some of the warmed GPU air
air exits the back of the case through
the GPU expansion slot and the CP blower
fan and that's supported further by some
ventilation on the opposing side panel
of the enclosure our unit uses an i7
6780 gigabytes of
ddr4 memory a GTX 1063 gigabyte card and
hosts two storage solutions a 128
gigabyte SSD
and a one terabyte hard drive of Mass
Storage Windows 10 is pre-installed
alongside a bunch of bloatware that we
instantly removed and this isn't the
first time we've had to rail against
MSI's use and reliance on bloatware
either last time it was with one of the
laptops the ge62 VR we're in testing we
showed a performance degradation of 10
to 20 percent depending on which game in
which bloatware was installed so it's
not great for performance you should
probably get rid of it immediately if
you are going to buy one of these things
and thankfully it's easy to remove just
through sort of control panel normal
functions but hopefully MSI gets the
hint eventually and does kind of move
away from Norton and all the various
control panels and things like that
regardless that's what we've got perspex
the biggest marketing point here is the
unit's portability and sort of DVR form
factor allowing for out of mind
deployment in a living room for HT BC
use or enabling land gaming portability
the unit we're running this one is the
$1100 unit if you go look at systems
priced in this range even if it's from
an SI versus a DIY approach you end up
with something like an I buy power or
CyberPower machine or whatever that's
obviously much larger than this but
probably about the same price and would
have a 1070 and maybe a 6700 K and if
you go the DIY route of course that's
also possible so the price on this at
$1100 with a 10 63 gigabyte card is
entirely because of the form factor you
are paying for the fact that this is
small it does not have a power supply
inside of it which allows it to be this
small and you basically plug in an AC
drop to the wall just like you would
with the laptop because it's always
going to be less than 300 watts power
drawn we'll test that in a moment so
you're paying for the form factor as
always our testing methodology and full
written review are located in the link
of the description below if you're
curious about how we tested anything
what drivers were used or software
methods used then check that article
starting with thermals thermals are the
most interesting a point for this system
and using our thermal testing
methodology with calibrated k-type
thermocouple for ambient and internal
diodes for the silicon we can determine
temperatures as a delta T over ambient
value and then you just add in your own
ambient temperature for Ralph
proximation our thermal testing for
systems is a little ridiculously load
intensive but the idea is to generate
maximum heat and see how the enclosure
copes with a worst-case scenario with
prime95 large FFTs and fir mark blasting
the components simultaneously the CPU is
hitting a delta T of about 60 6.5
Celsius or about 90 C if you add ambient
back in idle temperatures about twelve
point six the GPU meanwhile operates at
a completely reasonable forty nine point
four Celsius delta T or about seventy
two seventy three if your ambient is in
the 20s and the hard drive is getting a
little warm @ 32.5 celsius delta T but
remains acceptable overall as this
scenario is taxing both primary
components at 100 percent load we're
dumping heat into the case that will
then be recirculated by the CPUs blower
fan that's creating this higher CPU
temperature and under normal gaming
workloads the CPU remains closer to
about 84 Celsius still warm but not as
bad and intense workloads push it pretty
close to the limit granted 90 C isn't
really anywhere as bad as what we saw
with origins s FF Kronos PC a few months
back which was throttling before hitting
t.j.maxx
considering the tightness of the
enclosure it's not the world's worst
small form-factor performer when it
comes to thermals but it's not great
either msi could certainly improve on
the thermals by opting for a more
aggressive fan profile particularly with
the cpu even the GPU for that matter but
mostly the cpu and unfortunately most of
that intake is coming from the wider GPU
mesh right here so all your air is being
intercepted at this point and kind of
relying on the GPU to bring it into the
system and disperse it and that grille
just sort of for the record here this
one doesn't have a separate mesh or dust
filter to deal with dust in an HD PC
environment that's obviously concerned
especially with a small form-factor
system but we'll talk about that more in
a moment
thermal discussion is always best
accompanied by power discussion
measuring total system power drive from
the wall connected via the tridents AC
adapter we're seeing a power load of
approximately 235 watts when the system
is under complete maxed out load idle
sits in the range of 47 watts to 51
watts and that's not bad leaving this
thing sitting on for example without any
sleep states you wouldn't draw much more
power than a laptop load power
consumption and heat generation
shouldn't generally be
enough to heat up the living room
leaving noise to be the next obvious
question from desktop and with no
software running the tridents fans
generate a noise output of approximately
30 1.2 DBA after calculating out the
noise level of the room that's why the
noise of most laptops when idle assuming
fan uptime with the CPU and GPU fans
pushing to higher rpms when both are
under 100% load our noise increases to
thirty eight point six decibels and
that's borderline acceptable for most
living room gaming setups in my opinion
if you've got the TV next to this thing
the tridents and the couch is about 10
feet away then you're probably okay but
that's really a subjective point so up
to you to decide that overall the noise
levels aren't really that bad 38.6 DBA
for a completely Mac system is pretty
damn good overall for a small box
considering both gaming workloads will
generate a DBA output between our idle
and load metrics anyway time to talk
gaming performance this section is a
little less interesting since the
performance will largely be identical to
what you'd already expect from a 10 60
and an i7 6700 started with 1080p
benchmarks and ultra settings across the
board our lowest fps throughput is with
battlefield one at Ultra and a 96 degree
horizontal fov the game averages 59 FPS
with lows around 37 and 30s was
reasonable but does begin to choke a bit
in some more intense battles so you want
to slight settings reduction one step
down to compensate for that GTA 5 is the
next on the chart outputting an average
of 79 with low as 42 and 35 the 0.1% low
metrics Doom is next and that performs
adequately as well despite struggling at
times with 0.1% low values and our
average here is 67 and 1% lows are 39
dirt rally which we figure is more of a
couch friendly game average is a frame
rate of about 82 FPS with its options
nearly maxed and sustains high low
values through the benchmark course and
dota 2 unsurprisingly has no problems at
all
moving on to 1440p battlefield 1 starts
to struggle a bit but GTA 5 remains
relatively playable aside from a few
hiccups doom sits at 50 FPS now and dirt
rally drops of 61 average and just for
one 4k tests and some folks probably
will be connecting this to 4k TVs we did
see dirt rally at Ultra at around 33 fps
average for 4k so it's really not a box
you'd want for 4k gaming high settings
or otherwise as far as vr gaming running
the a three gigabyte gtx 960 is sort of
pushing the limits for what an HTC vive
or an oculus rift would demand raw data
exhibits a few app and warp misses with
low to medium settings but anything
higher than that is just venturing into
unpleasant territory isn't really
something you should consider
technically MSI is correct and that this
is a VR already system and that you can
play VR games and that's a big marketing
point it's kind of driving me crazy how
many components are going with v already
as their main selling point right now
but just sort of looking at that one
aspect they are technically correct it's
just that you would really be playing at
kind of low settings maybe a mix of
medium and low with the more intensive
games like raw data which we've tested
and Everest definitely trending towards
low to medium on that one so don't
expect great things out of this video
card with VR but it'll work
now value for this unit basically hinges
entirely on its small form factors so
again $1,000 $1,100 would get you
probably a gtx 1070 and an equivalent or
slightly better i7 in a larger form
factor machine so this markup is because
it's small and it's the same idea as
with laptops where you're paying more
because it's basically portable this is
not quite as portable as a laptop of
course we can throw it in a bag and it
would fit fine it's also small enough to
operate as a home theater PC while
remaining pretty quiet and hidden to
stay out of sight in the living room the
chassis is well-constructed
overall and survives our torture testing
for thermals though the CPU starts
getting hot when both components are
under high load its surviving though and
passing minimum requirements I guess for
thermals and an SFF build there's no
throttling going on which would further
be aided by slightly increased fan
speeds and some manual efforts and samus
eye has not that aggressive fan profile
gaming performance is what you'd expect
it's a GTX 960 3 gigabyte with an i7
6700 both well charted components that
leaves us primarily to look at overall
value of the box at $1,100 there's not
much that competes for SFF machines you
could take the DIY route and build
something like silverstone raven our
vizio 2 for a bit
p-per but it would also be a bit larger
and if DIY is completely unappealing to
you then the options are basically
origins Cronos which we found a pretty
questionable value given the price or
the Alienware alpha which is not really
a direct competitor a bare-bones variant
of the Trident can be had for $600 it's
basically a half-baked bare-bones
version if you want to take a semi DIY
approach to a machine this size you get
the power adapter obviously the
enclosure and then some basics like the
board and a GPU I believe but you are
left your own devices for storage and
from memory you could probably cut down
cost a little bit by going that route
but it's still getting pretty close to
the $1,100 price point that we saw for
this thing now there's also another SKU
there's an i-5 SKU for 950 dollars which
really shouldn't exist at that price
point I think this should come down a
little bit from the 1100 price point but
the 950 for an i-5 the value does kind
of get a bit muddied the Trident has a
few places it could improve for one a
detachable dust filter on the primary
intake would allow for way easier
cleaning given the oft dusty nature of
an HD PC environment and that caused
next to nothing
also nitpick that MSI is still sticking
the warmth avoid if removed stickers on
their panel screws which is sort of a
stupid thing to do on a box like this
it's not a laptop it's not tricky to get
apart and put back together something
like five screws and you have to dig
through that warranty sticker just to
clean the dust out of the GPU intake so
this is one of those things where either
you include a dust filter or you don't
you let people open it and I'm not
saying that this machine is worse than
any other machine with regard to dust
but in the real world the dust is a
problem and it's a much bigger problem
when the Box is small and when you have
low thermal Headroom like this one does
before heading throttle points thermals
are acceptable like I said they get by
but when you've got only ten or so
degrees to move when you're under a
maximum load scenario there's not a lot
of room so to MSI is just sort of the
quick suggestions for this thing for
improving it I would suggest one a
detachable cheap dust filter right there
to get rid of the warranty void if
removed threats on this particular box
it's just on a laptop I can kind of
understand it I know it's questionable
whether those are really enforceable but
on a small unit like this where it's
basically a desktop
and it's going to die if that's
backwards if they don't open it up and
clean it out I'd probably say get rid of
those stickers other than that you can
add probably some sort of latching
mechanism down here to keep it better
mounted in place because again not super
stable fine I guess but if you've got
people moving around or pets I would
feel very unhappy with it that way
probably leave it like that next
suggestion VR branding as always have to
be careful about it so yes it can play
VR games no users should reasonably
expect more than low medium low settings
and then finally the bloatware please
MSI get rid of it it's killing the
performance the labs house were the best
example because they were worse than
this thing that a lot more utilities
installed and performance it was pretty
nasty so this is an area where it's
really best I think to let the user
decide what's installed and the
bare-bones route would let you do that
so they do have a solution if you don't
want to go through the uninstall process
what you should do but still it's I
don't know that the the b2b partnerships
with people like Norton and all the
other software utilities all the control
panels all the audio panels all this
stuff I don't know that it's worth it
because it makes performance out of box
look worse than competitors and that's
not what you ever want so those would be
the main suggestions and the nitpicks
for this machine all this said with the
grievances aside the chassis is
well-constructed I like the form factor
despite this being sort of not the most
stable base it is artistically
interesting because of the way they've
angled it although not obviously really
only got one other option which is flat
like that so it's well built for $1000
it would be a much easier buy at 1,100
it is kind of makes me feel a little a
little weird about it but $1,000 you're
in better shape it's just again you're
sacrificing for size basically so that
is the Trident considering the density
of the unit the thermals under gaming
loads are fine noise is fine FPS is fine
but that's really all it is it's just
kind of everything is acceptable or fine
there's nothing revolutionary the price
reduction would help a bit in that
regard so as always pay channeling the
post roll video help us out directly
screamo for more information the full
review leave a comment because if you
don't you too but will punish our video
apparently that's what's going on this
week I'll see you all next time
