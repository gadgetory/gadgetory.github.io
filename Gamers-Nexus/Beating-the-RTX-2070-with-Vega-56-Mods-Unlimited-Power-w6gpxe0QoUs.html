mod the 242 percent power offset this
card doesn't have any stand of ability
that we had previously if you remember
the power offset it blasts the card with
way more power than any stock or
aftermarket configuration will allow for
and in doing so allowed the vagin 56
card to surpass Vega 64 when we tested
it originally the test today is whether
or not it can beat the r-tx 2070 with
the power mod because it's 370 to $400
for this thing as 500 to 600 for the
2070 so can we mod this to a point that
it surpasses the r-tx 2070 before that
this video is brought to you by US and
the limited-edition foil Graf logo shirt
this four color foil shirt is the iconic
GN Graf logo with average one percent
and point one percent bar colors it's
printed on a soft high-quality and
custom made 100% cotton shirt and is
available on stored on Karen's Nexus net
until stock runs out once it's gone we
will not be making more of these shirts
we sold out within two weeks of our
previous limited-edition shirts so click
on the link below to preorder now here's
what we're doing if you missed it
originally there is a mod you can do not
even a difficult one for the Vega cards
and that mod is to change the registry
and you can do a registry entry change
for power-play tables on these cards
that allows for the power target offset
to exceed the initial 50 percent stock
up to whatever you want we set 242
percent we work to build Zoid on this
probably about a year ago and they came
out and doing so a year ago allowed us
to fairly easily match Vegas 64 and even
beat it when it was overclocked in some
scenarios you could do the same thing to
Vegas 64 so it's not head-to-head but
you get the idea and then there are
other mods like just straight BIOS mods
be BIOS mods where on the card you could
more or less unlock some of the
frequency voltage targets that you get
on Vegas 64 though we didn't apply that
here because we weren't a hundred
percent positive if the BIOS options we
found online we're going to be
trustworthy and also we have to send
this card back
anyway so what we did instead is just
use the powerplay target and that
allowed us to get so much power into
Vega 56 that it can be the RT X 2070 in
some scenarios the only trouble is the
power consumption is massive so we have
some charge for you today that are going
to be gained for forints and then after
the gaming performance you can see what
the power cost is and I will note this
as well if you want to do this mod on
your own technically you know if it
works then it does it does save a bit of
money for the same performance level
ignoring the power aspect what we don't
know is does pushing an extra couple
hundred watts into the core kill it over
time and if it does how quickly so we
wouldn't really recommend doing this
necessarily because we don't know the
long-term impact for your hardware but
it's still a really cool experiment to
see if you can force Vega 56 in the beam
of the r-tx 2070 which is significantly
more locked down you would have to do
hard mods to get a similar over power
target that we did on this with just a
registry entry so let's get into it will
do the charts as always there will be a
link in the description below for the
full testing methods and the article if
you prefer that but let's start with
Sniper Elite Force Sniper Elite 4 is one
of the best modern API implementations
and leverages asynchronous compute
command queuing to use Hardware more
efficiently without getting stuck
waiting for as many synchronous
instructions at 4k high we found that
the stock Vegas 56 red dragon card
performed around 55 FPS average with the
stock our TX 2070 at 64 FPS average
that's a market lead but one which we
can take away by allowing an uncapped
power target of 242 percent on the Vega
56 card and by pulling down
significantly more power we have
performed the r-tx 2070 by well it's
within margin of error they're about the
same really at sixty three point eight
FPS versus sixty three point six FPS
average that is well within our error
margins but we can still call it a
victory
we've minimally managed to match the our
TX 2070 with Vega 56 the latter of which
costs about 370 to 400
while the our TX 2070 cos 500 to 600 for
reference Vega 64 ended up at around 62
FPS average one stock and so we're able
to perform around that level or
passed it with 56 as well everyone 2018
is next our 4k ultrahigh this one places
the reference Vega 56 at 49 FPS average
when stock compared to the stock our TX
2070 at 60 FPS average that's a lead of
about 22% the power color red dragon
model operated faster though at 52 FPS
average closing the gap marginally
already
and when overclocked in power colors of
Vega 56 card with a massive power offset
of 242 percent maximum power with about
a 1710 megahertz plus or minus 10 on the
core we surpassed the r-tx 2070 card by
about 5.2 percent
reaching sixty two point seven FPS
average that's a tremendous jump of 28.5
percent over the stock Vega 56 card
that's the reference model or 20% over
the red dragon stock card possible only
through this mod for perspective the
Vega 64 card performs head around 59 FPS
average and left the stock settings are
DX 2070 does outperform 56 when both are
overclocked to be fair reaching a new
height of 60 FPS average but this gap is
significantly smaller than the stock the
stock tab of the RTX 2070 and making
fifty six cards originally even though
the RTR 2070 is able to outperform Vegas
d6 with an overclock we still have to
commend the performance of the Vega 56
part further mods like Tobias might gain
us an additional overhead on the memory
primarily and again equalize the score
but at this point the power is way over
27 usage but we'll look at that after
the game benchmarks at 1440p the stock
power color of a given t6 red dragon
landed at 88.5 fgs average a market gain
over the stock vacant 56 reference card
it's still significantly behind the
stock r-tx 2070 which performs at 102
FPS average leaving the vacant 56 red
dragon to be outperformed by about 15%
stock to stock for reference new vegas
64 Strix ran out 96 FPS average
pushing Vega 56 with our power play
tables mod resulted in a frame rate that
again surpass the r-tx 2070 card the
modded Vega 56 push is 104 FPS average
with significantly tighter frames I'm
consistency than the r-tx 2070 a result
of never running zap our perf cap and it
pulled the head by about 2% that's a
remarkable feat for a card that cost so
much alas considering the r-tx 2070 cost
500 to 600 dollars again still
overclocked in the RT X 2070 allows us
again on
by another 10 FPS to be fair but that's
becoming difficult to notice for the
end-user as frame rate is already so
high but also power is more noticeable
and again we'll talk about that soon
we're not saying this is the best
approach given the insane power draw and
the mod we're doing but we are saying
that it's pretty damn cool to be able to
push a cheaper card this far ahead with
some tuning for a perspective here's a
look at frame time consistency at 1440p
remember lower is better but more
consistent is better than lower this
kind of plot is far more valuable than
frame rate as it gives you a true
representation of what you're seeing
we're looking at frame to frame interval
or how long it takes each frame to be
drawn after the previous frame Thank You
misty six is significantly better in
this particular title than the Nvidia
devices which may just come down to game
level optimization it's not always true
this is true for both these stock and
overclocked 2070 cards where you see
that the increased frame time
consistency on Vega 56 is represented by
its lack of spiky lines that you're
seeing on the 2070 and that's something
that can be seen in gameplay to some
extent as well finally at 1080p the Vega
56 card measures at 104 F he has average
on reference or 115 FPS average for the
power color model this allows a power
color card to reach 1070 TI levels of
performance although it's low frame time
performance is measurably better the
stock r-tx 27 he ends up at 136 FPS
average and the massively overpowered rx
fifty-six red dragon ends up at 134 FPS
average it's not bad but does show that
we're running into other limitations at
1080p a 4 Vega 56 frames I'm consistency
it remains superior for the Vega cards
here and somewhat noticeably so GTA 5 is
less exciting at 4k the red dragon 56
card ran at 35 FPS average with the RDX
2070 at 48 fps average that's a lot of
ground to gain and it just couldn't do
it even with the power mod the Vega 56
card ended up at 40 FPS average still
behind the 20 70s 48 FPS average over a
clock in the 2070 out of fairness the
gap widens to 53 FPS average looking
instead at 1440p the Vega 56 card pushes
80 FPS when modded improved over the
stock Vega 56 red dragon score of 70 FPS
Ori TX 2070 still holds a lead at 89 fps
though with the overclocked 2070 at 98
FPS average no hope for Vega 56 to pass
the 2017 this older dx11 title let's
move on to the next game Far Cry 5 is up
next and at 4k high settings we measured
the AR
Fagen 56 red dragon stock card at 41 FPS
average right around the 1070 TI and
behind the 1080 FP TW modern with the
power offset vacant 56 surpasses the AC
Vega 64-46 FPS average by a couple of
frames per second landing at 49 FPS
average on the red dragon this allows
power colors Vega 56 to beat the RT X
2070 by marginal gains at 49 fps verses
46 fps
while still maintaining tight frame time
consistency to be fair though the arc TX
2070 is equally smooth and its frame
throughput in this game overclocking the
2070 does allow it to surpass making 56
once again but by similar margins to
making 56 is passing of the stock 2070
it's at 51 FPS average vs. 49 again this
is pretty damn impressive for the Vega
56 card although it is definitely way
out of spec at 1440p the vega 56 red
dragon measured at 74 FPS average
immeasurable improvement over the 69 FPS
average of the reference card the RT x
2070 ends up at 84 FPS average and is
just barely beaten by our modern vega 56
again we have to be happy with the
results of this mod power is another
story one that's pending momentarily but
the performance is impressive at 86 FPS
average the vagin 56 mod we're looking
at a significant uplift over the stock
performance as expected the 2070 s
overclocked allows it to retake the lead
at 93 FPS average at 1080p far cry 5
becomes a CPU bound at the absolute high
end of a dodge is this convocation with
the parts we're testing today the Vega
vent e6 reference card is decently
behind the power color model 1492 FPS
average instead of 104 power mod in
bacon with d6 gets us to 120 FPS average
a remarkable climb of just over 20% the
our TX 2070 is within margin of error
plotting 118 FPS average once again
we've managed to minimally tie or
marginally outpaced the our TX 2070 with
modern Vega 56 and also once again if
you're willing to mod the Vega 56 card
you're probably willing to do so at
least a simple overclocking area on the
2070 this overclock on the 27 he gets it
to 128 FPS average but the gap has gone
much smaller than previously shadow of
the Tomb Raider is last it's a
significantly newer title that is
awaiting full RDX support still at 4k on
high settings we measured the Vega 56
cards at 35 FPS average and 38 FPS
average for the stock and overclocked
variants respectively this is a letdown
it allows even Vegas
de forage remain in the lead changing to
1440p we see the same performance stack
Vega 56 ties with 64 which is good for
other reasons but it does not meet the
2070 we've got a mixed bag for
performance overall so here we go then
we're getting into the power
measurements here and for power we
logged power during the entirety of our
benchmark passes and this is important
we're doing total system power here
instead of current clamping the cables
because there's power through the socket
as well and AMD and NVIDIA have
different policies for how much power
they draw through the PCIe slot and that
is why we're doing total system draw
because we don't have a better way to
clamp the PCIe slot so we're going to a
total system draw here but it's logged
and we synchronized the runs so that you
can compare run to run the different
SKUs of cards and see how they do and
that should be pretty useful here so
also all voltages on the board the
motherboard are completely controlled so
there's basically zero variance there
it's it's all in the video card at this
point for ashes of the singularity you
can see our power consumption across
multiple passes including the peak total
system draw at the most intensive parts
of the pass the Vega 56 mod pushes up to
about 600 watts total system draw during
this stressing part of the benchmark
while the stock making 56 card peaks at
around 400 watts we're pushing about 200
watts more with the power offset in the
mod that's a huge amount of extra power
going to the core as long as the vrm is
well cooled and assuming the vrm is a
decent one on the Vegas d6 PCB in
question the vrm should be fine what we
are unsure of is how much the Vega GPU
can take for how long a period of time
for this reason we don't necessarily
recommend this mod it could kill vrm
components if not done carefully and on
good PCBs with these in cooling and we
don't know what will happen with the GPU
after a long period of time with this
much power for the RT X 2070 that's
around 300 to 350 noit's total system
draw during the heaviest load of the
tests because the card is so peril
emitted at all times thanks to Nvidia
including only a 14% power
offset on the $500 model were testing
the maximum power draw on the OC test
never exceeds 357 watts on average it is
closer to a 330 watt peak draw the rest
of the games follow a similar pattern so
we'll leave that here
the r-tx 2070 clearly has a power
consumption advantage when stock or
overclocked with the overclocked version
drawing
slightly less power than Vega 56
although it is largely insignificant
here at 397 peak versus 357 peak it's
the modern 56 that clearly loses an all
power consumption needs a period unless
your goal to outperform the r-tx 2070
also includes heating the house and
again while this isn't something we'd
really recommend you do it's kind of
impractical because we don't know the
long-term impact of pushing an extra 200
watts into the core the V RMS can pretty
much handle it if you don't buy a
garbage card so that makes it partly
impractical it's still really fun though
the cost-benefit is convincing on 56 and
mostly it's just fun it's a lot of
overclocking so you get way more
Headroom we're pushing over seventeen
hundred megahertz on the core and it can
go higher we in the past we've pushed it
higher with liquid so in the past we did
in excess of 1720 approaching seventeen
fifty megahertz if I remember correctly
for a liquid-cooled vacant fifty-six
card so if you get a really well cooled
56 you have nothing to worry about on
the vrm it's just that core and will
perhaps leave build Zoid to speak to
that if he has any thoughts on it but
other than that vague 56 is capable of
beating the r-tx 2070 stock and it can
get pretty close to the overclocked 2070
when you blast it with over 200 watts
more power than the 2070 and 200 watts
more than the original Vega 56 which was
already drawing more than the 2070 so
whether or not that matters to you is
part of the equation but it's more of
the longevity either way though it's a
lot of fun to do and it's cool to see
Vega can perform so well right now is
actually this goes back to our review of
the 2070 where suddenly now that Vega is
available again with the death of mining
basically Vega is looking like a good
option 64 is not a card we've ever
really liked because you can do this 256
and get up to 64 levels of performance
but it's still it's it's about the same
price as the 2070 s on the low end
sometimes it's cheaper so it's worth
looking at the numbers and figuring out
if you want to consider an D at this
point we've been talking about
exclusively Nvidia for months now
because everything's come out at the
high end
and AMD gets no reference at the high
end 2080 28 ETA 1080i doesn't matter and
he does not compete there whatsoever for
performance so Nvidia dominates that
market and because they dominate that
market
you kind of start forgetting that AMD
exists in all markets so anyway the 2070
did decently at $500 we have a review on
it if you're curious but this is just to
say you know maybe remember that Vega
exists we did like 56 we never liked 64
though the price proposition was not
there but if the 1070 TI start going
away and were left with just the 27 he's
done suddenly it might be worth
considering so that's it for this one
thank you for watching as always go to
