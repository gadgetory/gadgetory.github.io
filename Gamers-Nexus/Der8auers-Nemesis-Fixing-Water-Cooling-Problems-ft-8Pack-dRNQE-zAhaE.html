the show floor
this is eight-pack he is actually dare
Bauer's nemesis
so a pack came over to me and said I've
seen you doing a lot of videos with
Roman and if you don't do a video with
me you're not gonna like what happens
that's actually quite scary so this is
pretty interesting Roman has his own
water cooling thing we talked about
monoblocks set up without tubes you've
got your own water clean thing you're at
overclockers UK yeah Thrones at caseking
yeah and you're kind of the same company
ultimately yeah ultimately for the same
company
right am i working together with with
slightly different focuses but the same
common goal right ultimate performance
no compromise there's something
different to the industry yeah so for
the water clean solution we were talking
about this I've seen so many open-loop
everything at the show a lot of it is
very similar right yeah but you're
talking about performance focus yeah
everyone else talking about RGB LEDs
before that this video is brought to you
by the be quiet dark rock slim keeping a
high performance focus but reducing the
footprints to accommodate full memory
slot compatibility the dark rock slim
comes with one of be quiet silent wins
three 120 millimeter fans built for low
noise operation the dark rocks limit
vert eyes is cooling capability up to
180 watts EDP but mixes in a matte black
out color design to combine performance
and looks
learn more at the link in the
description below yeah so on the
performance side what what is the
problem you're trying to solve and why
is it a problem I care about well for a
long time I'm trying to you know do
something different in water cooling
like you say everyone is doing the same
thing and for for that for a long time
we've been researching how we can do
something different and do something
better and I was lucky enough to be
approached by a company called
mix-a-lot's they were a research driven
cooling company based in Ireland
okay how Wonderwall said there was
something different okay I'm to go about
the project we first looked at what are
the limitations of the current particle
in solution and by doing that obviously
we selected a range of products and we
noticed that every single one is doing
the the straight impingement plate to
design onto a symmetrical fin yeah if
you like that's parallel
parallel microphone yeah hello micro
friends where the fluid is flowing down
right and we noticed with this
arrangement the temperature of the fluid
essentially was not equal across the
surface of the cool employee okay and
that the essentially that the
temperature performance was not scared
that what performance was not scaling
correctly with the power of the pomp or
the pressure of the pump and also that
there was no directed calling so the
cause at the end of the day in fact were
much warmer than the ones where the
liquid directed in the place so one of
the folks is then there are different
hot spots on the dies yeah exactly
depend on like every type of diary every
family's yet yeah so that's a nightmare
to design for but you were telling me so
you guys did some x-rays I guess yeah we
did some extra find out where the the
heats coming from on the day itself and
then we're tested for each block many
many in impingement plates so we got the
direct flow over the the dies it's a hot
spots yeah I mean of course any scale a
hex die is a certain force a 12-car 18
core whatever they they just cut off
features on the CPU itself so so we've
optimized the impingement plate for the
day in question okay so I guess coming
down to the performance side of things I
think one of the questions or comments
you'll get in the comment section is
okay but water cooling is already good
enough so who cares about the difference
yeah well I mean this is a no compromise
right its they've been the best of the
best and and not being a me too it's
yeah what what school in is spirit now
but you can still do something better
right right you know and of the design
that we've come up with is is also one
which will lower maintenance for the
end-user you know and every single CPU
that the end user buys they can change
the impingement plate so they know
they're getting the absolute optimum
cooling so for that then isn't like you
just pull a couple screws out and you
swap the plates so yeah you just you can
just undo the before Allen bolts on the
bottom
take up in the blog put in the near wimp
internment play we put together the ball
okay let's let's talk about this you
were telling me that there's a couple
things I wanna touch on but one of them
is direct to IHS or direct eye contact
option so direct eye everyone I think
knows you deal it to die an equal
directly I know it's a bit more involved
water cool and got let's do direct IHS
first because that's a bit different so
direct IHS you remove the copper cold
plate is that accurate yeah where they
move the the cold plate we tell a cup of
cold plate ask some really unique
features okay
but yeah you'll remove the copper cold
plate and you have a seal which is
sealing effectively the water block
directly to the IHS okay and obviously
by doing this you remove the copper
plate itself which can be an efficient
and you remove the layer of tin we know
is always inefficient even with the best
teams possible you know even with liquid
landfill you move up and you make that
much more efficient fewer fewer
interfaces is better yeah of course
always yeah yeah yeah so so the seal
then to make sure it doesn't leak into
the socket is it like it gaskets or what
yeah it's to gaskets that we've tested
to temperatures a you know really high
temperatures of 1/3 and we've tested
over long duration I mean that won't be
a skill that everyone will be able to
buy you know there'll be an SI stroke
service skill for like high frequency
trading all people who need the absolute
because obviously as you can probably
gather from the type of the skill that
it is it would be easy for someone to
make a mistake in mount oh yeah the best
instructions possible and I won't want
to damage anyone's hardware but it will
be available in si across the casting
group okay yeah
what about direct dye is that that's a
very similar similar configure it's just
an optimal play it now for the smaller
area of the of the direct secure just
from mounting for us from the screws
yeah okay exactly that yeah and we'll
have our own in time our own talk screws
so they click when it's mounted
correctly so you cannot over tighten or
under tight yeah I mean that's obviously
important with the megamagnifier seal
and also not damaging the da yes
other thing I wanted to mention so we
were talking about the the pressure of
the water coming into the block yeah so
one of the issues with water cooling is
people are well aware is stuff getting
gunked up over time yeah right inspector
and yeah and this it's partly a user
error issue if they're not if you're not
maintaining your loops that's kind of I
mean if you don't change the fluid in
your car it's kind of your fault to some
degree but there's definitely
manufacturers to do things poorly to
different types of coolant scan gunk up
as well of course yeah so we were
talking about how on the block side of
things you do a few things
and one of them has increased the
pressure going into the block itself and
the pressure flush out yeah it's pushing
everything out so then how are you
increasing the pressure well what we've
got with the the impingement plaintiff
resident the way it was obviously we
using jet impingement so the Jets are
you know according to weather with a
cause are a bunch of small holes right
yeah okay yeah of different damage is
actually depending on the the scipio a
ton of cool okay you know so we've
investigated all that kind of thing very
thoroughly but it's also obviously where
this higher pressure yes there's
slightly more impingement
however it's making sure that the the
data block itself is completely cleaned
out all right
you know normal gauntlets gunking up the
microf in style blocks is not going on
power blocks at all and it obviously
it's designed for maintenance-free the
only tenant should have to take a block
of pies if you want to change the
impingement wait till were to change the
queue and then you also and will
hopefully have one of these to show but
he also showed me a photo of the inside
of the coal plate yeah before we saw
like a thread ripper one i think yeah
one of the other ones and there were
bins of varying heights
yes is that accurate yes correct yeah so
then the simple question why well
essentially the the symmetrical parallel
fin arrangement is not efficient you
know the best way of cooling is is to
create like a vortex or create some real
speed and if you like turbulence you
know water so we have what we call an
offset strip fin arrangement okay which
is varying height heights of fins in a
pattern but very much randomized British
turbulence and again it's it's
focuses around performance okay you know
just keep it keeping pressure on
improving performance exactly that and
obviously there are studies whatever
ever will align to a new pump mm coming
later of course the way we want to beat
the competition by several degrees with
the current solution on the current
water cooling pumps but our solutions is
designed to also scale great with
compression okay so you know I mean
something like the direct dye we're
talking like over 10 degree way with the
right pump and and going in the other
and going into higher direction right so
it's a big I mean that's a hundred
megahertz on the CPL right you know and
for that customer that idea within and
indeed your viewers that's more frame
rate or it's more CFD or real
realistically not even frame rate just
just more points on the leaderboard yeah
of course if you're a benchmark this is
everything right yeah
okay so injection molding you mentioned
yeah what is it you want to you want to
tell me about that well I mean injection
molding is you know a very precise
manufacturing technique it's you're
making a water cooling market but it's
very popular in the automotive industry
and our manufacturing is done by a
company that is specialized in
manufacturing parts for very high-end ok
motive which is Tesla for example all
right yeah so I mean it's a very durable
technique a very consistent technique
and every single block you know they can
trace back when it was my new furniture
you know really for the highest level
quality control possible so sir Owen
puts the words German engineering
perfected on all of his products yeah
sounds like you might have even higher
standards yeah of course I like to think
so
I mean the Germans are very famous for
this and I have to say our and our
manufacturing is actually in Ireland oh
no they're manufacturing for around the
world
yeah and they're really the highest
grade possible so that the plexi finish
which you see here on the block this is
machine but it will be like glass in the
final product and obviously will I'd RGB
another features that the gamer of today
really not to my test with the game Adam
oh yeah
so x2 and x3 are the CPU
blocks yeah and then let's talk about
GPU briefly so what's a lot of the
concept is the same I guess
yeah the the GPU were on launch will
have 28 - 28 ETA right
the concept is totally the same the GPU
box name is vortex the idea is that they
get sucked out down the middle okay and
the GPU block also has the offset strip
fins
and as the shower head that is designed
to calm Emily the CUDA section and also
some section of it are targeting
individual parts of the dye yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah of course but it's Gannon
is between 8 and 10 see all competitors
in the GPU and we're also cooling VRMs
in other parts of the of the GPU board
that need okay that's pretty cool yeah I
mean the the CPU block code names are
like X 2 and X 3 a little bit player
which is the basic block Pro which is
the midline and then extreme which is
the direct that those are the three
ranges okay and obviously the pro will
be the lower end of the market but still
a very affordable price but still as
good as the top end blocks of the
current gen of everywhere else okay and
then the middle block is is better
and then the final block is better there
and like I said this scaling with pop
pressing big claims yeah but good very
good good to enter into it with a gal
actually like do something right I mean
eight pack is no compromise right so I'm
working with no compromise company who a
research-based and they want to do
everything the best and this projects
been ongoing for like nine to twelve
months now it's not something so we want
to make sure that we are the best that
row substantiate our clients right it's
the last thing then release dates and
prices any of that well pricing will
obviously be competitive the entry-level
blocked I say it's very close to if not
the same performances that the top-level
blocks and that'll be that be you know
much lower price than their top box CBD
though on a hard price yeah yeah yeah
yeah exactly because the
injection-molded manufacturing it is not
nailed down yet because we're going to
saw out the lock right right and that's
what we find you in a minute the
performance is nailed down is too
that were fine right but that hopefully
we're lucky to bring the product to
market within hike eight to ten weeks
okay so we've got a heavier if you like
development schedule on the look and
also the I guess the marketing materials
but how you fit the block you know the
Tim to you was at blah blah you know
that your stuff and all the
paraphernalia that goes around making it
a professional project right okay got no
compromise what I call it right well I
look forward to testing it yeah you can
check out more of this stuff I guess Oh
see you came yeah okay and obviously
Casey will be distributing all sir right
yeah okay explosively a bit available
from the kissing group as soon as it's
available
okay oh well thank you for joining me
yep thanks Steve you've got to run down
to that go watch there Bowers video now
so show him some love too and we'll see
you all next time subscribe for more
thank you for watching thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
