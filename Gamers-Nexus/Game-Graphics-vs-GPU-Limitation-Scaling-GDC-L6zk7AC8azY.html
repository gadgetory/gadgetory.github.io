dotnet and we're here at GDC 2016 i'm
joined by Wes McDermott and he is
working at algorithmic who makes
substance which is an asset authoring
tool basically for game companies before
getting to this discussion all this
content is brought to you by raw Furies
goner platformer game which you can see
on the screen now so Wes with the
audience we have it's all gamers but
they're interested in how this stuff is
made behind the scenes what sort of
tools obviously you may can work with
substance what sort of tools do
developers have to use on the art side
to create the assets for their games
well it could be a wide range of tools
as an artist myself I use pretty much
everything I can think of used Maya for
probably model creation also use the
foundries moto software a great deal
also you're going to use like maybe a
sculpting app so some of our customers
will use ZBrush mainly or you might see
some use 3d coat but basically it's kind
of hard to find like a one-stop shop for
you know all the asset creation like not
one program is going to do everything
perfectly so it's kind of as an artist
you got to have like a tool bag or a
toolbox full of stuff so for me it's you
know I got Maya ZBrush moto and then of
course substance for texturing right so
with tax trained specifically this is
one everyone talks about even on the
consumer side obviously you can see
textures and everything that's modeled
so in games you know you look at a
character like these guys behind us
they're all textured what goes into
making a good texture and how do you
balance that versus the load leveling on
system resources well yeah it's kind of
it's tough to really get in you know a
high level of that but I think that
we're really seeing kind of you know a
change in the way textures are authored
especially with the you know with gr you
know physically based materials and
that's what at algorithmic that's what
we really specialize in and so you know
the question of what goes into it I
would say you know understanding you
know the physical material that you're
trying to simulate you know all the
surface attributes and typically how I
say that like would all the one of the
service attributes that make up wood and
when you think about that in terms of
physically based rendering you're
thinking well
what's base color roughness normal ayo
those kind of things and so when you
look at it from that standpoint you are
going through the process of you know
having to know a bit about the material
but you're also having to know how that
material needs to be authored in a
physically based environment so yeah a
lot goes into it I think you also asked
about the low time and things like that
with a lot of the games that you see
that are starting to come out that are
going to be physically based that that
has attacks on the GPU much greater than
what we've seen before but you know as
GPUs are increasing physically based
games are going to be more you know the
norm of what we see so yeah there is
that that trade-off of that you know you
do have to have you know more shader
compute things like that but at the same
time you know you can get a much
physically accurate looking texture with
with very little effort and one thing we
were talking about the other day with
one of your other team members here was
just all the maps so we hear the words
normal map specular map diffuse all
these relief what are these words mean
at a top level what you know what goes
into the creation of assets yeah on a
top-level the way I like to refer to
that is I usually say when you have all
these map types they're basically going
to be inputs into the you know channel
inputs into the shader so I say
basically when you look at these maps
think of the they're just describing the
surface attributes of a material so if
you look at say like again an example of
wood again there's going to be a base
color which is like representing diffuse
reflected color then you're going to
have normal map which is going to be
kind of like the rough surface you know
it's going to describe surface detail
you're going to have like a roughness
map which is going to describe the micro
surface of how you know light is going
to get scattered and things like that
and you know things like that like the
roughness map those are utilized by
shader to simulate what we see in the
real world because obviously we can't
you know simulate something like that in
real time the technology we have now but
yeah in the process of what goes into
that it really depends on the tool set
and I and I i think you know not only as
a an employee of algorithmic but as an
artist myself that's where the substance
toolset really excels because you know
we think in terms of creating
extras as a full material so in
traditional workflows you would think
like you mentioned okay i'm working on
diffuse i'm working on specular i'm
worried and you would think of these as
separate entities and you would try to
pull them in and render and just guess
it looks right i'm kind of guessing
these values and so on but with PBR and
with our substance toolset you're not
only thinking about these separate
textures anymore you're thinking about i
want a material like wood or metal or
something and so you're viewing this in
real time as you work and you and the
guess work has been removed because with
physically based rendering you know the
the concepts of what the material is is
based on scientific measure data it's
not something that you know as an artist
I don't have to go look up these guy I
don't have to know like well this is you
know I just know that these values are
going to be what I need them to be
because you know they're they're
calibrated values and I can use those
and metals going to look like metal and
woods going to look like metal in all
lighting conditions so is there we were
looking at some new nvidia technology
coming out soon and we were talking with
them specifically about shadow maps
versus doing something else like maybe
put using voxels to generate some kind
of shaders or something in the game
shadows in the game are there instances
where technology from plugins or other
sources can be used rather than doing
sort of the mapping manually or are you
able to automate any process of the art
creation oh yeah you're definitely able
to automate processes of the art
creation a lot of a lot of that can be
done through you know substance as well
where you know some of the items that
you're going to have like you have a
mesh you're going to bake some
information about it like you might make
normal curvature a mean occlusion all
these things and you can feed those into
a material and for instance you can say
well in the occluded areas you know I
don't want dirt to fall and things like
that so when you're thinking of it in
terms of a procedural texture you can
have maps that were baked using GPU
Baker's that are going to feed that into
control how the procedural effects are
going to work so those type of processes
can be fully automated and one of our
tool sets is that we allow command line
batch processing of all these matt
baking's so we've had several studios
that use our tools in really awesome
ways where
they've had tech guards with setup a
material they would basically run it
through it just a system in-house
program they made that's gonna you know
they feed in the mesh bakes all of the
maps takes the substance material it
feeds in the maps the sets of material
regenerates the textures based on the
mesh data which is the baked maps and
then outputs texture straight to the
engine so the artist would sit down he
hits a button it generates everything he
switches his chair over to his other
monitor he's inside his engine and
testing the material so is a similar
process used for LOD scallion where if
we if we change mesh quality or
something in a game in the game settings
obviously you see a pretty real
difference in some games is that
manually created these different
qualities or is that part of the
automation process they can be part of
the automation process and with that to
you there's there's instances where you
kind of have to rebate certain things
depending on how much that changes but
in that case you know you're going to be
looking at it in terms of overall like
silhouette of the object you know so
like the normal map you know it's still
going to be able to be utilized from the
high res Bay and the curvature so you're
not going to have to like rebate those
things very cool and we'll close out
here but why don't you provide everyone
and understanding what substance does
for for the developers and maybe some
examples of developers who use it okay
yes well here at GDC we've got a lot of
presentations that are that are going on
right now and so the presentations
getting ready to start here in a few
minutes we've got the team from Rainbow
six who utilized that on siege we've got
several amazing artists from Naughty Dog
who are presenting you know how
substance was used on uncharted 4 so a
lot of Triple A studios black ops 3 was
recently used with substance painter so
we have a lot of these triple-a studios
that are you know really embracing our
tool set because it has it has the
ability to be automated and be able to
generate these textures in a very quick
way well thank you for joining me west
