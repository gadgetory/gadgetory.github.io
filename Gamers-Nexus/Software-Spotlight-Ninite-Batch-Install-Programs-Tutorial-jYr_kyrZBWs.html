to style night and today we were looking
at night for our first installation of
our software spotlight series which is a
brand new series that will help system
builders with different software that I
think it's pretty cool and very
utilitarian so as we look at night here
we see that as the title of the page
says it will help you install or update
multiple applications at one time it is
perfect for configuring brand new
windows installations and it's even good
if you have an existing system it can
help you find programs you don't already
have and it will batch download and
install them so pretty cool and saves a
lot of time as we see here we have all
of the core browsers the three good
browsers and then the devil browser and
I highly recommend an opera by the way
but you basically checkmark what you
want so let me give you a demo here I'll
download paint.net and why not we'll get
LibreOffice as well Google Drive is
pretty new so I will grab that and
everything else I pretty much have or
don't want by the way notepad plus plus
highly recommend along with opera above
and when we're just pretty cool too so
let's once you click all the programs
you want you grab the installer here it
will download a custom installer with
those exe zin them and then or actually
it will fetch the exe s so we download
it click show details and we see that it
is now downloading google drive it is
installing it downloading libreoffice
and that's pretty much it it just grabs
all these things for you as you see it
has already installed google drive i'll
drag it into the view here and it's
grabbing the other ones as well right
now so that's all there is to 9i it
should make your progress of installing
and configuring windows increase
significantly because all you have to do
now is launch windows for the first time
check all the boxes and then hit go so
that's it for nigh night please check
back for the next software spotlight
video and definitely subscribe if you
want more of these and like the video it
helps us a lot and i will see you guys
next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
