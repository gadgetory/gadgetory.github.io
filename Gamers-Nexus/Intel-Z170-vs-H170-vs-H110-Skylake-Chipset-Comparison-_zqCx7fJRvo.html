Nexus Donette and today we're talking
about chipset differences looking at the
new Intel lineup so that would be the
100 series chipsets and we're primarily
looking at z170a CH 170 and H 110 there
are three other main chipsets that are
out and that would be Q 170 q 150 MB 150
these are all classified as business
chipsets but as seen here by this MSI be
150 motherboard they can be outfitted
for gaming so it is a possibility we're
not going to talk about those as much in
this video but they have been discussed
in the article linked in the description
below if you want to read more about the
business series chipsets now that we've
got things like the z170 EVGA board over
here so two representations of what the
motherboard market looks like in the
immediate future and before we dive into
the individual differences of each
chipset out there we need to talk about
what a chipset is an established sort of
a base knowledge pool of how it all
works so a chipset can effectively be
thought of as the brain stem of your
computer this is something we've written
about in the past couple years ago
actually and the chipset handles all the
i/o all of the transfer and exchange of
information in your computer your PCIe
devices can communicate through the
chipset and will the storage devices can
go through the chips at USB Gigabit
Ethernet all that stuff at some point
can feed through the chipset in order to
access and communicate with other
devices that need to be met in the chain
of command so the CPU of course can sort
of overseen everything the CPU has its
own lanes and integrations now with
modern devices as well so modern CPUs
have their own PCIe lanes on the die
itself that means the CPU can and does
allocate some of its own PCIe lanes to
your attached devices like video cards
so the chipset doesn't do as much as it
used to when the days of Northbridge and
Southbridge it still existed but it is
an important part in that you can't have
a computer without one so that's the
baseline the next thing is to establish
what Intel's branding means so these
chipsets use two different
prefixes and there are many other
chipsets out there as well
the ones we're talking about and the
only ones that exists really in the
consumer market and business market our
X chipsets Z there used to be P H Q and
B and we're going to talk about each of
those means very briefly X is the
extreme series chipset this is the one
associated with the LGA 2011 socket type
which means that there are 2011 contacts
on the CPU 2011 pins on the motherboard
more or less you can activate some pins
or deactivate them as needed by the
motherboard manufacturer but that's the
X series and then there's the Z series
which is performance Z used to be called
the P series you may remember things
like the P 50 X whatever was P 57 maybe
motherboards and that was superseded by
the Z series
it means performance that is going to be
sort of the mainstay for gaming
enthusiasts for people who are
interested in overclocking and things
like that the H series is more
mainstream so it's still an important
chipset but it disables some things like
overclocking which generally makes it
more affordable than its a Z series
counterpart the B and Q series are both
business class chipsets and as such they
enable some features that are totally
uninteresting to a lot of gamers out
there but very useful for business
applications as an example one of those
would be protection against lower level
attacks on the system where an attacker
a hacker might be attempting to gain
access or inject something at a low
level before the operating system is
loaded so there are protections against
that in some of the business class
chipsets and then things like B 150
which is what this board is right here
clearly you can outfit be 150 to be a
gaming motherboard as MSI has done but
it is still equipped with business class
features it has Intel small business
advantage and items like that and you
can check the full charts on that if the
video is too quick for you in the
article below let's get into the 100
series differences for the 100 series we
have things like HS i/o high speed i/o
lines
we have PCIe lanes and all sorts of
other items that go into the
differentiation of chips has the main
item for the 100 series is the inclusion
of HS io lanes a high-speed eye Elaine
is allocatable by the motherboard
manufacturer to some extent for
different devices in the system so this
means that companies that make them
other words actually have some control
and customization over the board which
allows for further differentiation in
the motherboard market and that helps in
a time when a lot of the controllers
have been moved to the CPU itself like
the memory controller several years ago
and things of that nature HS i/o lanes
are consistent of the gigabit ethernet
options the SATA options PCI Express and
other i/o devices m2 would be included
in there as it is a PCIe interface
device and with z170 you get 26 of those
lanes the HSI o lanes with the H 170
board you get 22 or fewer the H 110 you
get 14 so that's the difference at a top
level what that translates into is a
difference of how many ports are
available on the devices now just
because there are 26 H s io lanes
available doesn't mean that the
motherboard manufacturer has to fill
their board with PCIe or SATA or USB
devices this is a good example this is a
mini ITX motherboards about six and a
half by six and a half inches it
physically cannot fit any more than it's
already on that board more or less so to
that extent
just being z170 doesn't mean you're
going to use all of those HS io lanes
for some crazy config the next big
difference is PCIe devices with z170 you
get 20 PCIe lanes available on the
chipset but those are offered in chunks
of four so you can't take eight of them
and give them to a video card for
example it sits in chunks of four so
it's very important with H 170 there are
16 PCIe lanes on the chipset with h1 10
there are six and do keep in mind as I
said
the CPU itself has some lanes as well
and those will generally be given to
your video card so these lanes can be
used for things like m dot 2 devices and
m dot 2 SSD will generally want by 4 or
X 4 that means it wants about 4 lanes
for peak efficiency and that includes
the new Samsung 950 and these are part
of the HS IO system so they're
allocatable 2 different interfaces on
the board as the manufacturer deems
necessary other than this it's generally
going to be for capture cards things
like that so if you want more PCIe
devices on your board including more
video cards you should be going z17 you
kind of have to actually with video
cards because the maximum PCIe
configuration for video devices is 1 by
16 device on this is e1 71 by 16 device
2 by 8 devices or 1 by 8 and 2 by 4
devices for a total of 3 with h1 70 you
get 1 by 16 or x16 device and the same
is true with h1 10 you get 1 x16 device
and that's generally going to be your
video card if you are any kind of gamer
with a higher-end card so one thing to
note here is that with SLI it is
actually required by Nvidia to have a
buy eight minimum Lane allocation to
video cards in the in SLI setup so if
you want to do SLI you're basically
stuck with two cards right now and that
may change as manufacturers Institute
things like multiplexing and PEX chips
plx chips things like that you will see
things change a bit in terms of these
specs offering on websites the lane
allocation will look different but in
reality it's just being multiplexed and
then on h1 70 you're basically given 1
by 16 device and you might get a couple
other devices through the chipset not
through the CPU where you are able to do
things like m dot 2 or whatever
two more major differences here and one
of them is pretty critical the memory
support and the overclocking support
z170 is the only of
chipsets that is capable of overclocking
through UEFI BIOS so if you buy a case
cue CPU and you have intent to overclock
that CPU z170 is the only board that is
in consideration for skylake processors
right now the other option here or the
other item of note is the memory
configuration z 172 h 170 are the same
they have two dimms per channel and they
have two channels h 110 which is much
more affordable has one dimple channel
and it has two channels that means your
capacity is going to be limited your
memory configuration is going to be
limited so do keep that in mind with the
H 110 chipset in terms of overclocking
and multi-gpu configurations and other
devices and generally the question of
which chipset is right for me the way we
determine this for our own builds is to
start with a couple simple questions the
first one you need to ask yourself am i
interested in overclocking if the answer
to that is no you can still buy a z
series chipset for other reasons but you
don't need it for the overclocking
function it's not going to serve you any
good so at that point you can start
looking at h 170 the next question am i
interested in multiple GPUs and am i
interested in multiple PCIe devices
which means GPUs PCIe SSD s and M 2 SSDs
in this specific case if the answer to
that is no meaning you want a CPU you
don't necessarily care about
overclocking and you want a GPU you
don't necessarily care about having more
of them then h 170 is pretty much where
it's at h 110 is still an option but
we'll talk about that momentarily and
where it becomes limited in some areas
so those are the main questions other
things to ask yourself are about raid h
110 does not support raid but Z 172 H
170 do and the Q and B chipsets have
their own raid support as well listed in
the specs table but for the mainstream
chipsets that's what we're looking at
and then other items multi-monitor
support using the IGP
for the IDP multi-monitor support is
limited
two three monitors on Z and H 170 and
two monitors on H 110 so that is another
limitation that should be noted for
those who are building more of an office
suited PC where you're not going to have
a video card there was a user recently
who commented on the article asking a
pretty good question they asked is there
a reason I would want a Z series chipset
if I'm not overclocking and I am NOT
doing multiple video cards the answer is
yes but kind of so the reasons for yes
are a few one of them is fairly specific
it's that you want high-end components
that are associated with the Z series
chipset but you don't necessarily need
the actual features provided by the
chipset so what I mean by this is higher
quality capacitors chokes vrm things
like that now if you're not overclocking
you're not using the features you don't
necessarily need those higher quality
components but this is a use case that
I've heard from some people who have who
have had me build systems for them
excuse me and another reason for buying
z3 is without wanting to use multiple
video cards or overclocking would simply
be because you need more HS i/o devices
so you're doing some crazy internal Nass
or capture card setup or anything we're
using a lot of i/o or you want a lot of
us be available or anything like that
then yes z170 is still on the table for
consideration for most users if you're
not overclock you're not doing multi-gpu
you're basically looking at H 170
immediately then H 110 as an alternative
the reason I am NOT a massive fan of
suggesting the H 110 to at least us
builders is because generally the price
of the H 110 motherboard is going to hit
a ceiling so this this is true of the
previous HDS as well so with the HT vs
motherboards and the lower and chipsets
there is sort of a an associative price
where the motherboard eventually hits a
ceiling and it stops increasing the
quality of components even though the
chipset doesn't necessarily dictate the
quality of those components and in the
US market you'll see H 170 boards that
are very good
and comparable to some of the h1 ten
boards in price but you get the extra
feature support a braid and some
expansion if you want to grow or
generally just potentially higher
quality components and if you're in Asia
markets if you're in non-us markets h1
10 starts making a lot more sense for
pricing reasons I'm not super familiar
with those but that is one of the
reasons that the ultra low end ships
that exists for users who are on a very
tight and restrictive budget h1 10 is
where you want to start looking for a
cheap motherboard if you're doing
something like a low-end maybe Pentium
set up and you have no plans to
overclock or do anything like that so
that's sort of the roundup of the
existing Intel chipsets that came out
with the skylake processors the
architecture and the 100 series q and B
are definitely worth looking at hit the
