their Bower we are in an extremely
awkward position for this video because
there is no better solution however
there's a a reunion of the bromance I
believe as you all have called it so
Roman niihama nee ho ho ma vie gates
it's a good idea yeah good
go support me I don't know let's talk
about the product in English before that
this video is brought to you by the open
bench table a lightweight and ultra
portable test bench built with high
quality anodized aluminium and with a
modular approach to design the open
bench table is easy to collapse store
and assemble to test different parts and
is one of the test benches that we use
in the GN labs the open bench table
contains everything you need to test PC
builds and configurations and it's
available in silver black red and a mini
ITX version learn more at the link in
the description below so Roman has
something new here from thermal grizzly
what's what is this microfiber cloth
what yeah it's our new product and it's
called carbon out it's something you
would assume is very similar to one of
those graphite sheets but smaller
perspective it's like a optimized
version so it's targeting the same
principle performance-wise
I can straight say that it's like a very
average terminal pace or like a lower
performing thermal paste but the big
advantage is that it has like endless
life time so you can apply it you can
use it for 10-15 years it will never get
worse over time and the big disadvantage
of graphite sheets is that I mean
they're extremely hard the very thin so
they cannot compensate any height
difference right so if you have your 7 9
8 exe or whatever IHS is always uneven
and the graphite sheet cannot compensate
that no matter how hard you're supposed
to conform better exactly because this
is 0.2 millimeter thick and it's quite a
lot softer I mean you you see that yes
it's like a cloth does it how does it do
with well what's the intended use case
under the HS over the IHS or over die
jasmaine logo yes so over the H
if you have a cold plate that is not
direct contact right you have heat pipes
that are contacting with no connecting
layer between each a pipe how does it
how does it do with that situation it
can form into the dancer well yes yes if
in that use case I would recommend that
you really use a lot of pressure like
this this product really benefits a lot
from pressure because it's 0.2
millimeter thick we tried to have 0.15
and 0.1 millimeter thick sheets but it's
very difficult to cut them so thin if
you cut them thinner the performance
will be quite a lot better so also if
you compress them if you use higher
pressure the performance will be better
first sizing this is a threader precise
container I think exactly so what's the
plan you're gonna have a intell size
that are precise exactly we will have
small intel size so roughly 3.3 times 3
centimeters then we will have for the
bigger CPUs so X 299 thread per the
small AMD CPUs and we will have GTX r-tx
20 ATI re X 20 area yeah so like six or
seven sizes for launch okay in terms of
performance numbers how do you expect
well I'm sure you know but how does this
compare to the the graphite sheet that
was popular maybe like a year year and a
half ago it's better for sure gets
better in terms of thermals yeah okay
it's it's better than thermal just
because it's conforming better to the
surface or yes okay so is it better
because of the conductivity is a lot
higher so this is sixty sixty two point
five watt per meter Kelvin graphite
sheets are typically something like 25
or 30 so this is like double but then
it's also thicker so and it's like a
linear equation so if you'd stop with
double the thickness you have like half
the performance so if you compress this
more if you use higher mounting pressure
this will perform better than graphite
okay and then I would assume the bigger
advantage is just more Universal
application
different surfaces because like exactly
we've talked at your videos in the past
you've shown the the dye height
differences across the dye where I
adjust like can cavity as they sort
you're right so so is that the the main
use case I know you mentioned RTX or GTX
support RT X I guess yes days what is
the what is the primary goal in that use
case are you talking like just for
someone who wants to never open their
card again I guess so there are
different approaches for me personally I
think the aspect that you can use it for
10 years without having any kind of
degradation it's a very important aspect
especially if you would use it for
example in a laptop right
that's what I personally use it in my x1
carbon is currently using this because I
would used it for long term testing in
there and no matter what kind of
telepaths you use how good it is even if
it's cryo knots they all lose a certain
degree performance over time you always
have to reapply them if you want to keep
up with the max performance and you
never have this year no matter what kind
of condition if you use it at minus 20
degree Celsius if you use it at plus 100
it will always stay the same and what's
also from eyes of my perspective very
important if you're a first-time builder
I heard it several times I don't know
why people are afraid of applying to a
place I know why we for the editors who
are watching this and we can leave this
clip in to you please get a clip of the
verge on the screen anyway continue oh
yeah good people are afraid of a client
their own waste yeah it's a good point
some reason and so you're you're saying
this just cuts that out I guess yeah I
mean yeah you get you just get it cut
into the perfect size you put it on your
CPU you mount your cool in you're done
right and then obviously install it
horizontally so doesn't slide around but
yeah yeah yeah okay so let's let's set
expectations I guess or actually
material side first to mention a bit of
this but what exactly is the like what
is the material carbon ops the name so
yeah it's it's carbon yeah its carbon
with carbon fibers and carbon nanotubes
that's why it has this very high
performance I mean 62.5 it's really it's
very close to liquid metal yeah it's
very high it's pretty much the highest
you can get
a lot hiring graphite also for graphite
cheese for example you have different
thermal conductivities in different
directions so like let's say in liquid
malleable you start driving below zero
it loses thermal conductivity I guess
right yeah it's actually it becomes
worse yeah yeah yeah and also like
direct reminds Direction wise I also
mean for example if you have the X and y
direction is the direction yeah there's
also different transfers and this is
optimized for in Z directions so towards
the cooler but also x and Y is almost
the same and right those that come down
to the orientation like the fibers yes
yeah because they're directed from the
CPU to the cooling okay
yeah certain expectations then so this
isn't something you buy to replace
conductor now or cry or not in terms of
performance exactly right or any other
high-end pace on the market as as you're
describing it sounds like more of just
long-term use right exactly consistent
you yeah consistent use very easy to
apply well you don't apply you just put
it on right and especially for notebooks
I can absolutely recommend it because
it's quite low heat or quite low power
density so the performance difference is
not that much compared to a normal pace
right but you never have to replace it
again
hmm cool availability any idea in two to
three weeks okay and I'm just gonna come
in this I guess with a vengeance each
sheet or something yeah we will have the
typical zip yeah we will always use and
then this is inside depending which size
you order it's two to three weeks and
then pricing depends on the size as well
so of obviously if you going for a 32
per sheet it's the most expensive one
but like the small intro sheet or small
GPU sheet is something like $8 probably
we're aiming for that price calculation
it's all runner percent done but okay in
this direction yeah okay cool so yeah I
guess stay tuned for a couple weeks from
now well I think we're taking this one
home right now you can pick this
soon as we're cleared for publishing day
that we'll go ahead and do that I guess
I'll finally buy something the graphite
sheets or something a lot of you have
been emailing me about that for about 18
months
so we'll get to it this time any
anything else you want to share about
this or any other products coming up I
mean you've got existing cryo not
conducting out all that stuff Tomo paste
wise we're working on an improved
version of cryo notes and we distributed
that already over the last half year to
extreme overclockers so it's an
optimized version for especially liquid
nitrogen it's a version where we grind
the thermal paste for almost six times
longer okay so in the process of
creating or manufacturing a thermal
paste so you have your different
compounds or like aluminium powder and
whatever zinc oxide and you mix it all
together you mix it with the typically
silicon right matrix material and then
you grind it so you put it between those
justice liners yeah you sit there with a
mortar and pestle and pretty much I also
feel all the syringes myself right so is
it I guess augers through machines
yeah right yeah and actually what makes
it really expensive is this the time it
takes to grind it because I believe if
you would leave it in there for two
hours but if you leave it there for
almost a full day it makes it so much
yeah more expensive right
because you also limit 12 times the time
capacity yeah it's only the time cause
it's also that you're limited in
production capability because you're
blocking this machine for such a long
time period right so that makes it quite
a bit more expensive but performance
especially under lm-2 is quite a lot
better okay so working on that first of
all we were not sure if we would bring
this to the market we will bring it to
the market probably try not extreme
something this direction maybe in like
two or three months okay cool
yeah so do bars also got a channel you
probably know of it but we'll link it
below in case you don't and otherwise we
have to go through adult cookies so
there Barrow thank you for joining me
like the we'll see you all next time
okay thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
