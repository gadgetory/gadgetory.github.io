gigabyte gaming 7 motherboard that we
reviewed recently the board was good
overall but had a major V core issue
where Auto V core was causing
temperatures in nearing 100 Celsius with
160 dollar liquid cooler that has been
fixed we're gonna go over the new
results here in this video before we get
into that this coverage is brought to
you by Corsair and their new 570 X
crystal series case which has tempered
glass on all sides RGB LEDs in the front
fans and we've reviewed that case if
you're curious you can hit the link in
the description below for more
information
so to recap everything with this board
first of all builds oi - term I initial
review we had him post another video
that talked about the PCB so as a
motherboard analysis talking about the
vrm components overall higher quality
than some of the competitors like MSI's
boards where they use the cheapest best
in China
gigabyte does a lot better in that
regard build Zoid overall likes the
motherboard unfortunately auto v core
was a big issue and again we're seeing
easily a hundred Celsius temperatures
with air coolers in the 90s with the
kraken X 62 at max rpm max pump rpm
luckily this is easily bypassed if
you're ok with doing manual v core it
could have been resolved on day one by
manually setting it to something like
one point two eight or something like
that which we did and saw a massive
immediate improvement as one would
expect we were in contact with gigabyte
about the auto v core thing since before
the board was launched and kb lake was
even officially out of nd8 so they know
about it they've got a new BIOS version
number f4q
which is available publicly on the
website if you have this board or are
planning on getting it it resolves the
issue completely so we've got some new
results for you to show the temperature
and voltage and power draw difference we
can go through those now the new BIOS
update has driven the auto v core
setting down to a completely reasonable
one point two to one point to four volts
when under the AVX stress testing that
we were putting the CPU through
maximally we saw one point to eight but
that was once averaging one point two
volts means a reduction of about two
hundred millivolts so that means a power
consumption and temperature reduction
both of which are significantly improved
with this BIOS update
and we're seeing that without any
performance loss on the CPU so you're
not losing performance before this fix
in fact we're seeing a performance
improvement over all the temperatures
now drop about 30 Celsius there is no
more risk of throttling on the CPU 7700
K in this case liquid temperatures only
report slightly higher in this testing
because the ambient does you'll notice
was a couple degrees higher so that
makes sense see be a package is what XTU
reports for the 7700 K so we can use
that for a main unit of measurement and
that's at sixty-four Celsius which is
the previous 94 cells use low
temperature under identical conditions
identical coolers all that stuff again
these numbers correspond to a frequency
that outputs identical performance
between each week or setting but with a
much more efficient voltage on the
updated test run
as for package power we're down to 105
to 106 watts average where we were
previously at 133 to 135 watts and
that's just because more volts means
more power consumption so overall major
improvement the board is now well within
acceptable purchasing territory for
anyone who was not planning to play with
the V course setting if you want to use
Auto it's good now I'm not sure if
they'll leave shipping with that update
for future boards there's a very strong
likelihood that they will be because
that's normally what these companies do
but regardless if you buy the board and
it doesn't have the update or you've
already bought it then grab the update
apply it through their easy flash
utility it takes less than two minutes
and you'll be good to go the board is
now pretty good Buy in all aspects from
our review because that only glaring
issue is it has now been resolved so
stay in price all that stuff I'd still
like to see a slight price reduction but
P core looks good now just a note on how
gigabyte acted during all of this the
way gigabyte responded and then
addressed the issue and then worked with
us to further test the issue was perfect
that is how a company should work with
media on trying to troubleshoot fix and
release updates and news for an issue
with the product they didn't try to hide
the issue and bury it and they didn't
try to discredit our work so thank you
all for watching you can go to
patreon.com/scishow and access if you'd
like to help us directly
of course gamers Nexus dawn that for
more info
we have some further information coming
up and testing on one of the competitors
to this board pretty soon and many of
you have already seen part one of that
so thank you for watching I'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
