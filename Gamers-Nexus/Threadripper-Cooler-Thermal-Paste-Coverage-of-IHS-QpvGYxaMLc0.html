thermal paste spread and coverage on a
thread Ripper IHS we have a cooler on
here already so the plan is to walk
through that this one's from the factory
and so it has the factory installed
thermal paste on it we also have silk
screens to show you how the spread will
be for different taste attack generation
coolers which will cover most coolers on
the market and then at the end of the
video we'll be walking through
installation of the cooler and the
installation of the CP and the socket
but first thing to go through is the
compound spread and then we're also
going to using our new prop that we've
put together specifically for the
purpose of scene where the dyes are
covered and where the thermal mass
covers versus something like a
traditional die before we get into that
this content is brought to you by the
thermal take flow RGB closed-loop liquid
cooler which is a three hundred sixty
millimeter radiator plus three 120 fans
that are RGB illuminated ether and we'll
take it rain fans at that this is a 4.5
done a detect pump which is one of the
faster pumps you can learn more at the
link in the description below so the
first thing we're going to do is
dismount this cooler these install in a
particular order they are numbered on
the mounting bracket the mounting
bracket comes from ASA packet is
supplied with the thread Ripper CPUs and
you can see that these two screws are
closer together than these two and they
are numbered one through four so two
three one four and that order and
orientation oh you know what before we
just mount this let me show you
something else I'm going to show you
memory clearance because we have to go
ahead to show all this stuff today and
we can't can't show performance numbers
I don't like unboxings I think they're
useless so instead we're going to try
and show you some useful things so
here's a memory module I'm going to
socket this over here in the closest
possible spot there's a keep out zone on
every motherboard and that means that
the manufacturers need to make sure
their products clear things so if you
mount really any ace of that cooler of
this size and form factor you'll clear
even if we have the tubes more this way
we would still clear I actually
specifically change the bracket
orientation on the cooler to make sure
that the clearance was not an issue you
have something like a kraken series or
an EVGA CLC cooler they are a bit larger
and they will start bumping into the
larger heat spreaders
on memory modules so be careful what
you're using what motherboard you use
how close it is between the memory
socket and the CPU socket so that shows
that it gets that out of the way so
we're good on this particular unit but
not everything will clear depending on
the board and the CPU cooler they should
they're supposed to it doesn't mean they
will because some of this stuff is
obviously maybe for thread Ripper let's
let's remove this in reverse order so
one two three four so that's the order
we're going to go for removal I like to
loosen these about 1/2 to 3/4 away and
then I loosen them the rest of the way
after that 2 1 and you are technically
supposed to tighten them in the same
order that you can probably do a bit
better I'm just going to go opposite
corners until it's loose alright so
there we go
let's go make sure I'm not going to
impact what we see oh man that is this
is my first time actually seeing that so
you're seeing it with me ok so here's
what we have this was installed from the
factory this their own pace you can't
get too much better than that normally
for something like thread Ripper I'm
thinking you might be able to get a bit
better than that
but we'll talk about that more in the
review and we can I actually saw some
data so here's our coverage now the
question is and this is something we
talked about a lot in the or at the
event the question is how much does it
matter that you're not covering the
whole IHS clearly the cooler the thermal
paste part is contacting there the rest
the cooler we've got a little bit more
space so let's see how much how much
more we have exactly so out the edges
we've got another just a rough quick
measurement here got like another 10
millimeters you go so how much would
that help us out here and I not get you
most away cover that I'd get you like
3/4 covered if this whole thing had
compound on it now it doesn't matter so
here's what the inside of one of these
looks like we've taken all of these
apart
that's important is to have the thermal
paste contact and directly under your
highest density of copper or your
highest thermal mass and for this unit
that's going to be right here this is
the same coal plate you'll find in the
EVG vga c LC coolers you'll find this in
the NZXT cracking coolers in Corsairs h
100 IV 2 of course there's h 115 i and
about 60% of the coolers on the market
that are CL CS so this is what you'll
find in all of those same thing it comes
from the same supplier this is an older
cold plate this one is from a much older
cooler master sidon cooler and even with
these although the copper circle of the
bottom the cold plate is larger the
actual density of microphones is about
the same on that so these are good
standings for what you can expect for
where your thermal mass will be on a
cooler you can look at it here we've got
the again this is the exact same as the
thermal take one for the most part that
we've got so you kind of line them up
this is what your contact area looks
like depending on orientation of the
cooler and either the fins are vertical
or they're horizontal and there's
actually an ideal way to do it
ideally you have it this way now
unfortunately there's not a great way to
know if you're oriented that way or not
without opening the thing although I
guess actually for future reference
let's see now they are actually they are
a bit different on these on today okay
well anyway theoretically this would be
better than the inverse than that but
yes that's our contact area not
fantastic but what actually matters is
as we'll see what this thing here and
here's here's your unboxing a and B yes
here is your media gift we actually put
it to real work so this thing
theoretically is a non-functional Rison
cpu an engineering sample it's a little
bit different for than the production
samples we drew on it so this thing
thanks to some measurements we found
online
hours video thanks to known information
about Rison which is the same dyes just
this is more of them we're able to trace
things out and figure out where the dyes
are through the IHS without deleting it
and each dye is eight point eight seven
millimeters by 22 point oh one
millimeters as I understand it today
something like 195 squared I think so
each of these is eight point eight seven
by twenty two point oh one roughly and
they are offset
thanks to their bowers video we were
able to figure this out we actually just
superimposed the image on the computer
with the CPU and we were able to trace
things out so the offset is something
like twelve point five millimeters
inward this way for the dye so from the
the long way it's twelve point five
inward and then it's about 16 to sixteen
point one five up or down in this case
and that's where your four dyes are so
what we care about is what's the
coverage over these does it cover the
dyes and this is what we've been saying
the theory of but we haven't known in
practice and we won't be able to show
you the data until launch day but the
theory is that as long as this cold
plate covers where the dyes are you
should be okay you don't need to contact
the whole IHS to cool now will it be
better probably you'll probably have a
bit more efficient thermal transfer if
you contact all this surface area that's
spreading the heat hence the name IHS
and conduct it through your cold plate
but you don't have to what you really
care about is the hot spots let's just
take a look at that right now that is
awfully close so there's your hot spots
they are in fact covered so yeah if the
theory is correct the theory being that
all you need to do is cover the dyes
then you are transferring heat into the
cold plate and therefore into the cooler
the part where it gets a little tricky
is these outer edges and only two of
these are active mind you these outer
edges are not covered by the micro fins
they're just covered by the cold blade
so you're not going to be the most
efficient transfer that means there's
room for potential improvement if cooler
manufacturers want to come in here and
make a better cold plate and it looks
like
a few of them have but not all of them
so two of these are active I have been
informed by Andy and this is public
information that we've already published
that the same two dyes will be active on
every thread Ripper CPU so let's just
say it's these two those two will be the
same it will always be those two on
every CPU from what we've been told
and these two are silicon substrate more
or less spacers we'll call them that
just help with mechanical mounting
pressure so it does kind of start
looking like epic at that point so two
of them are contacted but yeah that's
what it looks like next thing we can do
is start showing different we've got
over here actually a whole stack of silk
screens so let's kind of bring that over
here this is what we use to make sure
our testing is consistent from one
cooler cold plate to another so this is
an EVGA c LC but it's the same
it's a Gen 4.5 cold plate and then we've
also got for example bag of EVGA s 4.5
cold plates these are silk screens by
the way if that wasn't clear so to apply
these video on it we lock this to the
bottom of the cold plate do a syringe of
thermal paste there and then use like a
spudger to spread it and then you can
you can get perfect contact just like
it's out of the factory so four point
five is there we have Gen 5 which is the
current newest the Gen 6 is on the way
and we have gen for Gen 4 bit older now
Gen fives and stuff like the Kraken xxq
stories execute to 40 to 50 to 60 to and
the coolers where the pumps protrude
straight out of the pump block as
opposed to hanging off the side like
these so when you see them the tubes
rather not pumps the tube sticking
straight out of the block like some of
the coarser units the age 100 IV to I
believe does it that's a Gen 5 so let's
just go ahead and take a John 5 cold
plate since we know that there's the
most common and if you were to apply
it's probably gonna be about the same
spread
is it yeah it's about the same spread so
gen-5 will cover the same area as what
we're seeing with thermal takes which is
a gen four point five flow so let's look
at this over here give you an idea of
coverage without hopefully ruining our
masterpiece I trying to get a cleaner
one
okay here's not useful we've not doing
this so your coverage it's really not
fantastic the Z is the Z dead center Z
is dead center looking at our grid so
let's just go ahead and orient with the
Z somewhere around there you know work
with me obviously actually this is a dry
erase marker so I can't but somewhere
around there so one thing to point out
here is that the center of the thermal
mass of the cold plate is actually
situated over nothing so the normally
hottest spot of the CPU is going to
probably be around the middle of the
cold plate but because this is for dyes
that are segmented with nothing and dead
center the coolers actually sitting over
that dead center area and that's not
even a hot spot so your most efficient
point of thermal transfer and
dissipation is not really going to be
leveraged with these coolers on these
CPUs it is not necessarily a fault of
the cooler design or of the CPU design
it's just a byproduct of the to not
necessarily being ideal for each other
so no one's really at fault here you
could just do bit better though so the
hotspots will be on the dies so top left
bottom right or bottom left top right
depending on the which ones are active
those will be your two hotspots and
those are at the perimeter or the
periphery of the cooler the cold plate
so they're actually going to be less
efficiently cooled than if your cooling
is on the dead center like a traditional
single die CPU for desktop so that's
something to point out how much it
matters again we'll test it I keep
saying that but it's important to say
not to jump to any conclusions right now
until we can test it and publish the
data I mean again you're looking at the
cold plate making contact and covering
the dyes just barely just like a
millimeter barely covering them the
thermal compound won't make full contact
you might want to go in there and add
some more if you if you feel so inclined
I might improve your thermal contact so
get a Gen 4 is Gen 4 not a big
difference between these in terms of the
contact area so I'm thinking it's going
to be about the same yeah got the same
so if we can kind of get this on camera
the silkscreen is imperfect but the
circle for the dome place is pretty
close to it it's roughly around there so
what you're seeing is is this as a
pointer you're seeing as the dye right
here
feeds out to this area so this is the
border horizontally and vertically so
we're not covering with the thermal
compound but we'll cover it with the
cold bleed once again how much that
matters we'll find out soon but we don't
know today or can't tell you today so as
you can see the only point of concern
here well aside from not having full IHS
contacts which may or may not be
irrelevant as we'll learn in the review
hopefully the main point of concern is
where these screw holes are you're going
to have some hot spots because contact
is not perfect these are indented a bit
so you're not getting copper contact
you'll get a screw contact and if you go
through it and add more thermal paste
you'll at least have a thermal interface
there otherwise this is actually
indented and there will be a small
pocket of air and a hot spot on the
particular part of the dye that
corresponds to the hole so we can kind
of lift this up a bit and you'll see we
can see down to part of the dye so it is
imperfect there will be some slight hot
spots we would encourage at least adding
some thermal paste where the screw holes
are so that you can get transfer up
somewhat to the cold plate but just be
aware of that and we can't really
comment on how performances
is until Waze tested it properly so all
that in mind may be an issue may not be
an issue and then Jen 4.5 we've kind of
ready showdown will take cooler so
that's what we're looking at for
coverage let's um let's take the
threader for CPU out of the motherboard
and walk you through that process
without dropping the media sample off
the table so for this again let me just
kind of wrap this up we'll talk more
about this coverage in the future it's
coming but not today in the very least
you have an idea of what to expect for a
Sutekh cooler coverage on these they
will clearly not cover the entire area
and actually let's just go ahead and
kind of line this up to show you good
enough it's not being tested right now
okay good enough so yeah let's let's
like just go ahead and do this one more
time there you go there's your coverage
plain and simple within spare ly
centered more or less so there's a lot
of room here for cooler manufacturers to
do something interesting with thread
Ripper in all theory this should be fine
oh do the air quotes there it should be
acceptable that doesn't mean it'll be
the best doesn't mean it'll be optimal
but it should work because you are in
fact covering the dyes so we should be
good in that regard but it doesn't mean
it's optimal so to release this thing I
said we'd show how this works there are
three Torx screws I think they are TR 22
one point 5 Newton meter torque Torx
wrench included torque wrench that is
torques to be clear to remove the thing
you go three to one to add it there to
close it rather you go one two three and
these are they've won two three vrm
oriented up one two three and because
it's a torque wrench that means when you
close it how this demo it for you when
we completely bottomed out the
Tork will get it click it comes as I'll
fight you so once you hit that you can't
go any further this is actually really
good on AMD's part I am appreciative
that they have made it plain and simple
exactly how much force you can apply to
these things so if you do lose this
wrench that comes with it it's 1 point 5
Newton meters or if you prefer that's
13.3 inch pounds and I think a TR 20
double-check me but I think that's what
it is so we remove that you get blue
latches under here make some room it's a
blue latches apply light upward force
same process we're adding the thin
Springs forward pull the orange tab
comes out there's your socket this
orange housing is meant to stay on the
CPU do not remove it do not throw it
away you'll need it so that exposes the
pins and more or less gives us an idea
of how everything goes together now if
you want to install it to you basically
would well where's our socket cover I
can show you exactly how it goes so
here's how its ships ships with one of
these covering the LGA socket something
like that
just make sure alot pinching pins ok you
should keep that in case you ever need
to close it up again to protect it and
for RMA purposes you will need it and
then this slides in or out through there
so when you get the thin it will look
like this and then you loosen them
three-two-one Springs forward it'll be
like that you release this and then this
do not push on the back you'll break
something pull this tab up here slide it
out and then at that point you can
insert and socket the thread Ripper CPU
like this it just it slides right in
orange tabs should meet the black at the
bottom and then you remove your socket
cover very last to protect it till the
last moment
push down if your socket correctly which
we are and it sockets and then you go
one two three and close
it so that's what it looks like that's
the thread Ripper CPU rapid installation
but more focus again was on this aspect
of things and if we were to mount a
bunch of coolers to this all the attack
ones will look the same so what you're
interested in this is what does it look
like when you get some special like
knock to a cooler they've got those new
air coolers coming and you mount one of
those two here with the larger coldplay
well it should look like the whole thing
is covered and theoretically that's
better in practice we'll try to find out
a be testing with coolers like that you
need two different cold blades we'll try
to get something arranged but the very
least we know that a stack coolers will
cover that die area you will not get
full IHS contact you don't necessarily
need it but it's probably nice to have
stay tuned for our review that will show
you how much if at all it actually
matters compared to something with
fuller contact and I think we have some
plans on how to simulate that in a way
that is realistic enough to give you an
idea of what one of these would look
like if it had full contact because
we've worked with these enough tone them
down enough to have the resource to do
so so that is the CPU installation and
walkthrough of the cold plate cooler
installation all that stuff if you want
to install a cooler it's got the four
screws just like I said a moment ago you
just socket it down one two three four
and you're done make sure the closer
ones are at the top near the prm's and
for today this is all we can show you
so Andy has approved that we can show
you the CPU installation and we can show
you cooler installation and as an
addendum of cooler installation we
showed you cooler coverage and contact
area so thank you for watching as always
