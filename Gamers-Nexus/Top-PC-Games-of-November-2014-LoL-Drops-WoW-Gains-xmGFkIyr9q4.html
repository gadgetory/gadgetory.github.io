nexus net and i'm here to talk about
raptors most played pc games for
november 2014 so raptor if you didn't
know is a digital gaming platform that
basically takes your achievements and
tracks your progress from multiple
platforms like Steam PSN xbox live etc
and yeah they're actually walking
distance from where I live so it's cool
to hear from these guys monthly about
you know what games are being played the
most and kind of track the trends from
that no big surprise League of Legends
has been the monthly number one getter
and it's still at number one despite
some of the plate i'm dropping between
this month and last really it went down
about sixteen percent there wasn't any
any major release there was an update of
the game but there were some long queues
when that update was happening as we get
through december here perhaps plate i
might go up as a result of the Intel
Extreme Masters Tournament that was here
in San Jose not too long ago coming up
close to League of Legends are closer
than it's been recently was World of
Warcraft it's amazing to see what this
game has done after ten years warlords
of Draenor has just continued to up the
playtime in that game and actually since
it's been released play time for World
of Warcraft has doubled so that's pretty
impressive especially for a game that
that's that old on the contrary the play
time for blizzards other games were
talking about hearth stone and diablo 3
has actually dropped blizzards been
pretty busy as a result of blizzcon last
month and yeah there's been a lot of
hype around those games and heroes of
the storm even and i think that's that's
an alpha right now a lot of other
competitive games also dropped in their
play during november competitive games
and mmos like minecraft and our cage
those dropped a lot counter-strike
dropped smite dropped dota2 dropped so
yeah there aren't that many changes in
the list in terms of the rankings versus
last month but the play time overall for
those games has gone down for a lot of
them Final Fantasy 14 is an exception it
went up twenty one percent over the
month that's because there was a 60 day
free trial in the game of the year
edition that was recently released and
so that's one of the reasons why it's
still going strong it didn't change
positions but again game time was up
November was a weird month I would
definitely say that because you have
spite
solitaire cracking the top 20 for the
first time in 11 months it's not number
19 and guess what the the place i'm
actually peaked on thanksgiving so
people i guess we're playing with their
families so yeah they're yeah new to the
list are two games that released in
november one of them is call of duty
advanced warfare which although coming
in at number 17 and perhaps speaking
further in december or january it's kind
of more of a console game in terms of
the popularity of competitive FPS is the
other game that debuted on the list at
number 10 is dragon age inquisition from
bioware that only released November
eighteenth so that had a strong turnout
for a couple of weeks they're dropping
off the top 20 were two games that we've
actually reviewed as well as a couple
others like fifa so yeah the first of
which is was shadow of mordor the
open-world action title that we enjoyed
very much and kind of surprising to see
that given that had a pretty good sale
around black friday the other game that
was dropping off the list there was
Borderlands the pre-sequel a game that
Steve reviewed and benchmark he wasn't
too crazy about that alright so that's
pretty much a rundown from what Raptor
has we'll be sure to keep you guys
posted when we find out the next results
for December do you know any of the
games that we could possibly see make it
back to this list how far will call of
duty go how far will dragon age
inquisition go go ahead and let us know
in the comments I think that from these
results here we haven't seen the effects
of the games that were purchased during
black friday actually you know pan out
here in the last few days of November so
perhaps we'll see some some games that
were on stale with steam or black friday
actually make this list as well remember
there aren't really any big releases
among pc games in december so perhaps
it'll be kind of rehash of what we've
seen in October or September where it
just comes in a second wave but anyway
we're curious to hear what you say be
sure to stay tuned to gamers nexus for
more pc gaming trends and coverage stay
classy
