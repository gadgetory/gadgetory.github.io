nexus net and today we're looking at a
star citizen benchmark if you follow the
channel you already saw my benchmark
course which was effectively the marie
racing cup where I flew around the
circuit and sort of looked at various
buildings and things like that to try
and stress the GPU and this is the
actual benchmark results which have been
published on the website for a few days
now but I wanted to get it on the
YouTube channel as well so first of all
this is benchmarking the point 9 22
alpha star citizens arena commander 10
just came out the other day I briefly
tested it I haven't done a full test and
it performs pretty similarly to the
point 9 tattoo tattoo alpha so there
haven't really been any major
optimization changes yet there have been
a lot of changes don't get me wrong they
just they're not on the hardware level
just yet so star citizen will be a
fairly complex game graphically once it
ships it is presently in such early
alpha that you cannot apply this
information to the game as it develops
so if you're looking at this six monster
when the video was published you need to
look at one of our more recent
benchmarks because this will no longer
be relevant as for the Alpha in its
current state it performs really sort of
okay on medium and low settings but it
doesn't do to great on very high because
it has not been optimized for hardware
yet and Nvidia and AMD don't have
drivers yet and all these sorts of
variables that come into effect and
aren't are unaccounted for in an alpha
of a game the GTX 980 performs at almost
60 FPS average on very high settings so
it struggles a little bit and the 780 Ti
is 46 780 is 42 290x is 37 so really you
if you're trying to play on very high in
the Alpha you need a pretty high end
card I would not buy based on this data
because it will change when the game is
optimized and you'll be able to buy a
cheaper card most likely all these
things noted the game it performs much
better in the arena commander
dogfighting module and in the hangar
module so it's it's doing the worst the
worst case scenario is the Murray racing
Cup which is what you're looking at here
and that's why I tested it
and that's just because it has more
models and objects and things to load
and crazy stuff like that a lot of the
graphics options haven't been integrated
yet like PBR is sort of still being
developed and things like that so that
is not accounted for in these tests on
medium the GTX 980 does better it's at
71 FPS so it's very playable and the GTX
780 Ti is performing well also and so is
the the 780 the 290x doesn't do so hot
as for the low benchmark it's basically
playable on everything except 750ti 270x
but I do think it will get there at some
point all this information provided it's
fairly playable right now on a medium
and low settings you will probably not
be able to play it on very high unless
you've got high-end hardware one point I
would make some changes but nothing
major for optimization and I'll be
testing this game as it iterates every
time there's a major optimization patch
I will publish a benchmark that way you
can check it out and see if it's doing
what you needed to do for for the
hardware that you have so that is all
for this benchmark and I will see you
all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
