product on the op tain platform the DC
or datacenter P 4800 X this is a data
center drive it's not a consumer device
you should not buy it as a consumer but
it will be using the opt-in platform and
3d crosspoint architecture these are
things which will not change as they
move toward consumer products probably
later this year or maybe sometime next
year sometime soon it will happen that's
just how these technologies work so we
be talking about that today just to get
everyone hooked in the device announced
today the P 4800 x cost 1520 dollars
it's an nvme SSD it is 375 gigabytes and
then the software bundle is 1951 dollars
that's quite expensive but we're going
to go over why in a moment before
getting to that this coverage is brought
to you by EVGA and their new 1080 TI FTW
3 icx card which will launch within the
next few weeks the card uses the new icx
NTC thermistors for measurements of
temperature across the board learn more
in the link below
so some housekeeping stuff first obtain
the 3d crosspoint and quantex these are
all words that we need to kind of define
before getting into things obtained is
Intel's platform leveraging 3d
crosspoint architecture quant X is the
micron version of this and Intel and
micron worked together to create 3d
crosspoint so they are both working on
this they both have hands-on they just
have different implementations to some
extent with Intel's being called obtain
that is the platform that's the
collection of everything 3d crosspoint
is the actual architecture underlying
this this was built as a means to solve
some trouble in the memory and storage
spaces particularly as it pertains to
enterprise and data center that's why
they're starting here so the basic
example the easiest would be to look at
something like the New York Stock
Exchange you look at a Stock Exchange
all they care about is being first just
like a lot of YouTube commenters and so
they want to be first to make that trade
they want to be first to get in the door
with whatever transaction they're doing
unfortunately storage is not that fast
it's gotten a whole lot better with SSDs
but memory is still the absolute fastest
type of access you can make outside of
the CP
use cash memory though is not that big
and when you get those bigger capacities
like the 1 terabyte servers that you
could build it's expensive as hell what
do you do well you probably throw a ton
of SSDs in there and maybe put them in a
raid or something like that that's still
not great SSDs have a higher latency
than memory they're not quite as fast as
memory and the upside is they have more
storage the cost per gigabyte is far
better its non-volatile that has some
other advantages potentially what Intel
and micron are trying to do is create a
middleman device between memory and
storage this means that we're looking at
something that is going to be faster
than SSDs in terms of access times not
necessarily the sequential speeds or the
random speeds though some exceptions
apply but access times and Layton sees
will be better but slower than memory
overall though you get some of the
benefit of extra capacity now that said
at 375 gigabytes for 1520 dollars
doesn't sounds are great but that's
again a data center drive so things are
a bit different in that space now
another thing the clearway here the
interface to talk to opt in is not some
new special obtain interface
this is not like envy link or anything
like that it is using standard
interfaces so it can function octane can
be deployed in MDOT to devices in DRAM
ddr4 sized devices and in a ICS or
add-in cards that would be your PCIe
gen3 four-lane type of add-on this is
going to be interesting going forward
because right now all we have today the
P 4800 X is a data center drive it's a
PCIe drive it plugs into a PCIe slot it
functions on nvme at the interface
what's different is as things move into
memory and until may Sims with obtain or
you might have an MDOT to stick using
non-volatile effectively memory so
that's something that we're interested
in in the future but we don't have
information on that too much today other
than what's already been exposed in the
past few months before getting into the
technical details just the standard note
there's a bigger article in the
description below that
stone wrote it he focused on all of the
detail collection during the press event
so you should check that out if you want
more of the detail
I'll give you most of it as far as
starters he's got the rest another note
here unfortunately we have a lot of
slides and we don't have any b-roll I
don't like doing voiceover over a
slideshow but we'll be doing some of
that because Intel didn't allow any
video capture or b-roll of the devices
at the press event or the demos even
though they already have photos of the
same devices online I don't know why
they decided to do that but I'll have
some slides for you for things where I'm
not on camera the data center P 4800 X
is the first obtained device announced
and is meant for use in servers with
Xeon processors and compatible
motherboards that would be an e5 V 2 or
e 7 v 2 or better the P 4800 X will be
broadly available by second half with
initial availability starting today
again this is a data center drive it's
not really meant for anyone in our core
audience but we'll talk about it as the
same exact technology will be coming to
the consumer drives at some point in the
future don't have full details on that
yet but there will not be an
architectural change in a substantial
way from data center to consumer it's
more or less going to be disabling
features that you don't need to drive
price down so that means this stuff
applies going forward as a consumer the
P 4800 X can be used as a supplement to
system memory or as storage configurable
through Intel memory drive there are
limitations to the expansion of the
technology most notably system memory
expansion is not recommended to exceed
eight times the amount of DRAM installed
and each 375 gigabyte obtain SSD is only
good for 320 gigabytes of a system
memory expansion it also appears that
only the AIC is usable as system memory
not the YouTube version that were still
waiting on more information from that
obtained is a combination of 3d
crosspoint memory media Intel memory and
storage controllers Intel interconnect
IP and Intel software the 3d crosspoint
storage media is a solid-state
architecture which is defined in our
articles below the memory and storage
controllers we're told anyway works
similarly to flash and then Daz as the
controllers with some notable
exceptions that will likely be discussed
in detail when we actually have one of
these things to review the interconnect
IP and Intel software appear to be a
combination of in-house developed code
and licensed software from a company
called scale MP which specializes in
virtualization and symmetric
multiprocessing allowing for a single
piece of software to take advantage of
large numbers of aggregate CPUs and
massive amounts of shared memory the
controllers main job is to interface
between nvme and 3d crosspoint media and
storage is architected at the byte level
so this gives Intel some flexibility
with regard to making dims or storage
devices in the future when making
storage devices they are adapting to a
block level so that allows Intel's 3d
crosspoint media and opt-in platform to
communicate via nvm ease for kilobyte
block schema that's important we're not
really sure how this is happening just
yet those details haven't been disclosed
but if we ever find out but in theory we
will we'll update you in an article or a
video what we were told is that one four
kilobyte read is spread across multiple
channels per die using the intel's
proprietary controller programming we
now know that there are a total of 28
thighs spread across a seven channel
controller and that controller works
best with an even die to channel loading
one major difference at the chip level
between NAND and 3d crosspoint is the
way rights are done in flash nand a cell
has to be erased before it can be
written again and that means that the
controller has to clean up a block at a
time for every write this cleaning
process is non-existant 3d crosspoint as
it has a right in-place design rather
than a PE cycle in the way that we are
used to with SSDs and that means when I
write is requested the cell's properties
are just altered not cleared and then
altered or rewritten in that case as
discussed in the article linked below
the read behavior of the cells is
electrically similar creating a uniform
readwrite behavior that means that both
operations should be efficient a final
interesting point is that we were told
that there is somewhat wear leveling
handled by the controller so that
specific cells don't die out
than others this indicates that there
must be some sort of table lookup which
means that there could be time added to
Layton sees that was about as much
detail as Intel was giving us the ho at
the chip level these are data center
drives you could actually buy one if you
wanted to they're not meant for you but
you could pick one up they are supposed
to deliver on lower latency as stated
previously that's more comparable to RAM
then to an SSD Layton sees a lot lower
here doesn't matter in enthusiast or
consumer use cases I don't know we'll
see
I'm helpfully skeptical about it but for
now we know that the enterprise P 4800 X
is meant to be better with Layton sees
than SSDs and better with endurance than
a SSD is capable of sustaining something
like 30 total Drive writes per day for
three plus years that's that's a lot of
read and write cycles so those drives
will last a lot longer in theory based
on what Intel tells us then the SSD is
currently out due so that's an
interesting point the latencies are
lower
reportedly they should average something
like 10 microsecond latency on typical
reads and writes and Intel has also
shared with us information that the
drive performs steadily under two
gigabyte per second workloads what an
opt-in SSD can do that flash and SSDs
can't do is increase load and allow the
latency to remain the same across that
load until saturation of the data bus
that's new
that said octane is really not built for
sequential workloads so if all you do
data center user or not is pushed
massive sequential files back and forth
all day this might not be for you so you
might be better off with SSDs for that
but in terms of randoms this is where
obtained is targeted right now for the
drive that we were shown today and then
latency is being the bigger item of note
so this is just the beginning of octane
we don't have a whole lot of information
outside of the data center stuff today
crosspoint octane have a lot more
information out there that we have to
dig through you can find the article
below if you want more of it as for how
much you should be interested in this
I'll say the things that we always say
which is don't preorder this
if you see the P 4800 X and you think
that you want it one where did you get
your money and to wait for actual
reviews of the product it probably won't
come from us but look for it from
someone else it's not really the place
that I specialized in so P 4800 X I'm
sure there will be reviews out there
look for those before you buy the thing
because it's a big expense and it's
questionable how much you'll see as a
consumer as an everyday user enthusiast
or otherwise data center it looks good
it looks promising but I am I have
reservations about getting too hyped
about octane for consumers right now we
will see as things progressed and as
Intel gives us more information if that
changes once we can actually test the
thing that would be nice and see how it
performs and see if it's actually
worthwhile but for today
just hold on wait and we'll let you know
how it progresses otherwise keep an eye
out for P 4100 2x reviews I'm sure
someone will do them I don't know that
the typical sites you follow will if
they're related to us so as always thank
