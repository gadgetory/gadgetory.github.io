it's a pseudo small form-factor case but
it fits micro ATX and mini ITX
this was launched during Computex and we
originally shot our review before
leaving for the show but held
publication to revise for accuracy upon
seeing launch marketing materials the
case is a micro ATX tower that
accommodates a mini ITX and an m-80 ax
in a sort of small box like a mini tower
but doesn't promote itself heavily on
the small form factor or ITX front for
this case we use our I TX test bench for
imperfect testing of something that
wouldn't accommodate our ATX bench
obviously although we are considering
adding a micro ATX test bench for the
onslaught of cases throughout later this
year in the meantime consider this a
study on air flow using an ITX test
bench useful for basic concepts with the
280x although you should ultimately use
it for micro ATX if you're going that
route before that this video is brought
to you by us and the gamers Nexus
anti-static mod map the GN anti-static
Mada is a four foot by two foot surface
two millimeters thick of high-quality
industrial grade anti-static material
and it includes a common ground point
for earth a grounding wrist strap
and it has on its electrical wiring
diagrams that may prove useful a GPU
silhouette and grid for your teardown
efforts and other useful items go to
stored on cameras nexus dotnet to pick
up a GN mod mat today so for this case
basically even though it's kind of
billed as an MIT X case you could also
kind of Co the micro ATX route it is a
larger case so mini ITX maybe not the
most appropriate branding for this type
of build it's a large box if you measure
in terms of litres which is the most
appropriate measurement for mini ITX or
small form-factor systems this is one of
the largest ones we've reviewed thus far
if not the largest by quite a bit it's
significantly larger than the
Thermaltake core v1 which is already in
debatable territory at 20-plus litres
for its size it's way way larger than
the SG series silverstone case is the
Raven series Silverstone cases so it's
quite big and that poses
for tests and it means that
unfortunately the testing that we plan
for with many ITX cases is not as
representative of most real-world cases
as we would like in this instance we're
still going to do the tests I'll walk
you through the results just keep in
mind that because this is a larger case
you can actually fit a small tower
cooler on here you're not forced to use
a downdraft cooler like we are using for
our standardized test and have to use
for standard eye test testing so you can
use a smaller a small tower cooler you
could use a CLC mounts at the front it's
got to front fan options it has top fan
options as tempered glass covering all
of those unfortunately it also has a
couple of mesh filters some of which
make more sense than others the one on
the top for instance doesn't make a
whole lot of sense because it's already
set up as exhaust so it really should be
an optional filter it's not gonna be
filtering much dust there's a glass
sheet on top of it and it's blowing air
out but it's there nonetheless it does
restrict air flow a bit it'd be nice to
just put it as an option but either way
you can take it out yourself and we
would recommend you do so if you leave
this in the stock configuration the top
exhaust fan other than that the side
panel the other side panel does have
filtered well you can put a fan there if
you wanted to otherwise the other side
is for the power supply and this is a
carbon part metallized case so the left
side compartment my left you are right
is where the power supply the SSD is the
hard drive and the cables are housed
it's very large actually you don't need
a mess of X PSU we're using the N arm
access of X PSU for a standardized
testing you can use a more normal sized
ATX power supply if you wanted to the
right side is also pretty large for the
type of case that it is and houses the
rest of the component stock it comes
with two fans one on the front one at
the top and we're gonna go through
Patrick's build notes for the rest and
then get into thermals and noise and
some concluding thoughts the - ATX is a
bit similar to eleven dynamic and
appearance and layout just less so in
terms of fitting ATX motherboards the
larger section of the case houses the
motherboard and GPU CPU of course and
the smaller chamber to the right holds
the power supply the drives and the
cables jogger support is as good as many
mid towers with a hard drive cage that
can hold two three and a half inch
drives and another cage that can hold
three two and a half inch drives both of
these cages are removable and held in by
a thumb screw which is nice but there
was
plenty of room even with the cages
installed for cable management and other
endeavors the PSU and hard drive cage
are stacked on top of each other and are
accessible from the rear of the case
which makes adding and removing hard
drives extremely easy repeatedly opening
the case during testing got old very
quickly the top and side glass panels
are held on with four thumb screws
apiece but we've seen better designs
from coarser before
and we'd like to see manufacturers move
towards more convenient ways to fasten
glass panels some have others are
lagging behind a bit the rubber washers
that pad the glass are held somewhat
captive in the panel which is also nice
and they hold the panels away from the
case so that there's a little bit of
airflow much like the view 71 except not
that much the front glass panel isn't
intended to be removable and is
unfortunately held captive by plastic
pegs and sticky tape in order to remove
the front filter either remove the front
fan or the whole front panel assembly
must be removed removing the glass would
be much quicker and we suspect that it
may have originally been intended to be
removable but they end up putting sticky
tape on there for some reason instead
making it much harder to take out and of
course limited in the amount of times
you could take it out cable management
is excellent since there's so much room
behind the motherboard there a cable tie
point scattered around but there was so
much room for loose cables that we
didn't need to use any of them cutouts
are huge well placed and more plentiful
than they are in most full-sized cases
even but micro ATX boards will cover two
of the largest cutouts towards the front
of the case there are two 120 or 140
millimeter fans each on the top front
and bottom of the case and one more on
the non glass side the side mount isn't
particularly useful but it's better to
have too many family occasions than too
few
neither of the bottom mounts are filled
in the stock configuration but a bottom
intake configuration would be a good fit
if this case had actual legs of any
length
unfortunately because there aren't any
included that are longer you really
shouldn't be using the bottom for any
kind of fans because there just isn't
enough clearance we'd like to see at
least an inch there and optional feet
would be a good way to achieve that as
it is airflow is just as restricted from
the bottom as it is from the front but
for different reasons
moving on to thermals noise for
additional testing for this one we
limited ourselves to a noise normalize
test
and we also had one test of the top
filter removed the top filter is
completely unnecessary in the stock top
exhaust configuration as the glass panel
prevents any or most dust from passively
settling into the case anyway and I
recommend moving it for anything but a
top intake configuration for the noise
normalize test we generally turn the CPU
fan down to 80% and then adjust the case
fans down
but the 280x was quiet enough that we
were able to run the case fans at 100%
and the cpu fan at 90% and again I want
to be really clear here if you missed
our mini ITX mini roundup a bit ago you
should watch it but basically mini ITX
is the least scientific type of testing
possible for the most part and that goes
for micro ATX testing as well
particularly because we don't presently
have an M ATX test bench but we can
still look at build quality airflow
patterns and overall value today in
terms of case reviews especially mini
ITX this is particularly difficult
because you're dealing with things like
this and it looks pretty good but it's
large and the thing is when is this
large it can fit way different types of
coolers and other components different
types of video cards even and then we
have things that we more prepared for
like the Raven series or SG series or
really anything actually small and small
form-factor and those require much more
condensed componentry you're working
with downdraft coolers you're
potentially working with half length
video cards although a lot of them
support full-length and so the problem
again is that as you change cases your
options change and we can only do so
much to try and standardize for ITX case
testing before at the end of the day you
just switch to a better cooler like in
this instance where with this case you
could probably stick a decently sized
mini tower cooler on there or just some
kind of CLC although it would be quite
suffocated with the glass position the
way it is on this case so keep all of
that in mind we're not saying that the
thermal data here is necessarily
representative of the way you're going
to build but in any case where we can
compare like with the core v1 for
example which can fit basically all the
same hardware to this case those are
pretty much linear comparisons we may
end up looking into some other options
for ITX cases though maybe do something
like downdraft cool or really small
build for SFF proper k
and then have a slightly large build for
oddities like this course or 280x
anyway for the torture test and we'll
start there and go through the rest of
the numbers average CPU temperature was
71 degrees over ambient celcius for the
torture test and looking at thermal so
d1 degrees is the highest CPU Delta on
our chart but we've only tested three
small form-factor cases previously the
stock intake fan has pointed directly
towards the CPU cooler but hot GPU
exhaust must travel upwards directly
past the CPU in order to escape and the
top exhaust fan drags GPU exhaust
through the cooler above it the CPU
cooler that is and because we're using a
standardized downdraft cooler we also
see significantly warmer CPU results
than in cases with less aggressive top
exhaust the glass front panel also
doesn't do the intake any favors
removing the top filter which we
recommend put CPU temperatures on par
with the Cryobank Taku and a couple
degrees below the stock thermal take v1
moving on to tortured temperatures for
GPU testing average GPA DT under torture
workloads was fifty five point eight
degrees Celsius in the stock
configuration and wasn't significantly
affected by the adjustment of the CPU
fan or the noise normalize testing which
we'll look at later
comparatively fifty five point eight
degrees is nowhere near as bad as the
GPU temperatures were in the Taku but 51
point six degrees with the top filter
removed is the lowest GPU temperature
among the four cases now on our chart
the size of the case means that the GPU
has plenty of room to breathe and the
conventional airflow pattern means that
exhaust freely flows both out of the
back and out of the top of the case an
additional intake fan under the stock
one at the front of the case could help
even more but an intake fan directly
under the GPU would be better but again
you probably want to elevate the case a
little bit for that we do strongly
suggest removing that top filter though
as it's unnecessary when considering the
exhaust nature of the stock fan 3dmark
as a gaming stand and presents the two
ATX at fifty three point three degrees
celsius gb delta temperature and puts it
close to the thermal take v one better
than the cryo rec taku and worse than
the silverstone SG 13 it's possible that
with the top filter removed the two ATX
could beat them all CPU temperature was
twenty seven point four degrees Celsius
a few degrees higher than the other
cases despite the CPU not really being
loaded during this test more evidence of
GPU exhaust heating the CPU cooler also
we have some information on the
frequencies of the GPU during this test
and fortunately the 280x did pretty well
it held steady and didn't really drop a
lot of clocks average CPU temperature
during the blender CPU render was forty
five point seven degrees actually cooler
than the other cases on the chart with
the airflow pattern in the two ATX GPU
temperature appears to have a strong
effect on CPU temperature since much
from the GPU exhaust must travel up and
pass the cooler again when the GPU isn't
under load CPU cooling is decent average
GPU temperature doing the GPU render for
blender was thirty four point seven
degrees Celsius again close to the v1
and a couple degrees off from what it
should be because of the top filter see
the temperature during this test was
twenty five degrees warmer than the
other three cases and again that's
because of the exhaust noise normalized
coursers to ATX
naturally reduced noise emissions versus
our other tested cases granted by it
glass everywhere at a fifty five point
six degrees ET result or seventy two
degrees c p results this is unimpressive
overall as the reduced noise output
meant we could run the fans faster but
the choke the nature of the case
prohibited improved results for vrm
results under a tortured test we
observed the 280x placing vram at low
temperatures at fifty five point eight
degrees the warmest of all thus tested
and vs RC at 57 degrees remember both of
these numbers are well within spec way
below spec but the point is to build a
comparative data against other cases
open air testing is represented by the
Taku with the drawer open and shows our
baseline floor at about 40 degrees
the 280x was quieter than other cases on
our chart at 44 DBA despite to stock 120
fans 44 is still objectively loud but
this is a result of the CPU cooler we're
using for testing and is why we might
make changes to this bench later but
it's a learning process
that's why adding ITX took so long the
glass panels do an effective job of
damping the noise directly in front of
the case and course if fans are fairly
quiet to begin with the 280x is smaller
than a mid Tower and larger than most
ITX cases so its market it's somewhat
limited it's an interesting case though
the compartmentalized nature of it is
something that coarser
as well and has done for a long time
it's actually a layout that we're a fan
I've overall but this case is a bit
large it's got glass that's really
choking the fans so completely
regardless of how you test ITX cases
there's absolute truth that the filter
placement is a bit unnecessary in some
instances and probably should be default
off with an option to add it for the
user the glass is way too close to the
steel of the chassis so this top glass
panel could be elevated a bit the side
panel here should probably boost it away
from the steel a bit like in the view 71
for instance which cools abnormally well
and as because of the gap between the
glass and the steel the bottom should
have optional feet to elevate it for
better air flow and the front also while
I mean the front glass panels just kind
of bad in general in terms of how its
installed and looks like it was a
last-minute decision to secure it maybe
they had a shipping issue or something
like that we don't know but it's using
adhesive to secure the panel to the
front which seems insane so there are a
lot of things that could be improved at
this case overall though just to be
clear we do like the overall look of it
we like the build quality of it Kayle
management is trivial because it's so
large and it gives you a lot of options
which cases of a small ish form factor
don't necessarily do and also cases of a
small ish form factor don't exist in
many of the higher quality tiers of
cases you generally either get forced
over to a mid tower or forced over to
SFF properly and not everyone wants that
so this serves the mid step between them
it's just that's about the only audience
it serves if you are in that audience
excellent it's $110 case not a bad price
for what it is quality overall is good
you can make a couple improvements
manually if you want but be careful in
choosing your coolant even with better
cooling than we have it is still
restrictive and that's because of the
way the glass is mounted however they
give you the options to improve it and
that's a good thing we would however
like to see added optional feet to boost
it off the table a bit or wherever it's
sitting so that you can get some extra
airflow through down from just
underneath to drafted a sort of stack
effect style anyway overall it's not a
bad case at all it's just sort of oddly
sized and whether or not that works for
you is up to you as a
case in terms of build quality we like
it in terms of kala management we like
it in terms of thermals it has a ton of
places to improve and then it's got one
oddity that really stands out and that's
this front glass panel otherwise if you
can deal with the downsides that were
mentioned here it's okay and just make
sure it fits otherwise buy something
smaller if you want a terse just get a
mid tower otherwise because it's it's a
really strange market but they didn't
okay job at trying to create one so
