okay a bearded hard where he is
basically a pro overclockers the best
one we could get well that sums it up
we're doing a couple live streams this
weekend so mostly Joe will be
overclocking Rison so we've got 2,700 X
and that'll be on Saturday at 1:00 p.m.
and then on Eastern Standard Time then
on Sunday at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Standard
Time we're doing a kingpin 20 atti
overclocked no that should be fun that
should be pretty sweet so you want to
see both because the 2700 X we had
non-stop requests from you all to do
rising overclocking so we're finally
coming back to do it don't let me down
make sure you're there to watch the
stream because if you better be there if
you let me down we're never listening to
the comments again so help me the stream
dates today we're setting up the systems
and like I said Joe's gonna do most to
work on this one so I'm not even gonna
pretend like usual before that this
video is brought to you by Corsairs iron
claw RGB wireless gaming mouse the
corsair iron claw focuses first on
comfort with its palm grip approach and
also uses a sub 1 millisecond wireless
connection for the pc you can toggle
between wireless and Bluetooth
connectivity making it easy to control
multiple pcs with one mouse like a
stream PC and a gaming PC the mouse has
10 programmable buttons the pmw 30 391
18,000 DPI sensor 3 zone RGB LEDs and
50-million click lifespan for left and
right mouse buttons learn more at the
link in the description below so where
do we start
for the kingpin card I'll take the
kingpin card apart and prep it for needs
Basile and I guess yeah
nope oopsie and everything as usual and
and Joe's got a motherboard actually I
bought that for it that's the crosshair
7 I think
yeah Corsair 7 ok it's been the newer
version yeah so we we've got stuff on it
right now we will we'll start here and
then we'll walk back later and walk
through some of these initial steps so
right now there's an Allen tea pot on it
already this will have to come off a
little bit later to do some testing
can see - I think we have three we have
three yeah we have the Lisa sue signed
2700 X and this one I'm excited for
because if we do test it I think I want
to lap it so anyway we've got that one
Joe's got to where are you on air with
this thing when you overclock with air
this one's probably about four point
three three something around there then
it just dies off after that okay yeah
four point three three gigahertz you
know what wall did you rat ah it depends
on the LLC I said so the load line is I
think it's that three and then it's
about I think four point or one point
four three I think
okay I think that's what the nay I uh
with closed loop liquid cooler
yeah souped-up by a KO if you look up my
channel the AI for the stream we will
have Allen's here so this time this time
I got two tanks there's this one the
inner inner tank we think might be I
don't know it's kind of shaking yes a
little bit more than usual what Steve
doesn't want to tell you is actually I
got mad at him earlier because I do
everything and I I broke the tank yeah
he threw it disclaimer I didn't really
throw this one's a fat I think they call
it a fat 180 or something or fat eighty
so it's the same amount to in each one
but we'll be using those during the
stream and today for prep then we've got
the Dewar back here means your name so
fatty we've got the fatty so this is a
don't hurt yourself thirty Peters Dewar
that I think you've already filled yeah
come on pick it up Steve yep already
well
yeah what's that Alan teapot t-rex okay
kingpin kingpin pot yeah it's an early
version before the new public version
but it's a nice pot I like it
and that's hooked up to your
thermocouple reader at my fluke yeah we
can show more of this as it get to use
too but the point of that I guess is to
show where's that is that jammed under
the between the IHS and the Alan teapot
it's in the Alan Taylor new pot but it's
pretty much though the wage drill then
is is pretty close so it gives a really
good reading so cool well let's get
started I guess I'll go grab the kingpin
card and start taking that apart right
here and then you do whatever you need
to do is you need to do something cuz
yeah
should we do a liquid nitrogen safety
notes again I guess let's let's talk
about it a little bit again so people
understand the the risks and the lack of
risks where they apply sake what's like
wearing sandals yeah so let's see the
first when you get on your hands it's
not so bad no I'm sure hits and and I've
done this - it's this soaking effect so
it's like kind of water if you get
soaked it's gonna hurt but if you do it
like graze it's not gonna do anything
yeah it'll stain a little bit but it's
not like painful though no it's just
like a little tingle like I mean they
didn't pay maybe sometimes a pinch but
alright I've had people like close their
hands and stuff and that's when they
don't actually hurt right
I had a lady do that at Computex one
time I'm like no no don't do it and
actually complained about it I was like
yeah never it's we talked about this
last time too but it's worth going over
again though the soaking is the concern
right so like it was get it if you like
get it in your socks or something yeah
socks are usually about there
but beyond that it's not so bad when you
pour and then also with the ellentube
canister has to be a little careful with
the transfer hose on there so yeah when
your figure filling up the tank you want
to make sure you hold the hose because
it builds up pressure eventually and if
you just unruly or release the valve it
could just go up and smack you in the
face or it'll hit somebody shattered
glass or shatter a glass door that I can
take a good bite we won't talk about
that so this let me go through some of
the cost to you for those of you who
didn't catch the last one this transfer
hose I can't remember exactly I want to
say was like $300 or 280 or is between
like hi 200 and 400 bucks which i think
is about what you paid for yours isn't
it yeah but that was like 10 years ago
yeah well the prices haven't changed
yeah still expensive
so yeah that's transfer hose I guess
they're expensive because they're rated
for well they are heavy-duty yeah I mean
I can pretty much beat you over the head
with it that's encouraging yeah and then
Alan to itself off top I had I think
it's minus 196 degrees Celsius so the
tanks are there pressurize is a 22 psi
tank that I ordered you can get higher
psi you have medical grade if you needed
if you ever get it it's called concern I
don't know you could basically say low
pressure tank because then they have a
high pressure I forget what it runs at
but you don't want a high pressure one
that's what you really got to be careful
yeah Aaron is that a swing
yeah yeah I was like $440 both just to
give you an idea and cost cheaper than
last time not bad actually
so that's the tanks 180 liters in each
one and this should last us the whole
weekend
leek depends I'm gonna how much fun we
have yeah I guess I'll note that too so
do you want to explain the the
pressure-release I'm like when you hear
the hiss noises when you shouldn't hear
the hiss well any time you're moving a
tank it builds up pressure so if you
hear this there's a valve that goes I
think if it
yeah it's that one so if you're moving
the tank yeah so usually when that when
that's blowing off that's not good so a
lot of times we'll just hit it tap it
with a hammer a little bit just kind of
cuz they can freeze after a while so if
they're shooting out for a while get a
figure it's really cold so it will kind
of get stuck so sometimes if you had a
hammer oh basically it's not like freeze
that valve oh yeah and it would just
keep on shooting now and you'll lose all
your liquid nitrogen yeah like we did
last time yeah and the delivery guys did
that too first thing he did when he got
off the truck was just bash it with a
wrench
yeah yeah sometimes you just got to be
something is that gonna be on your next
shirt
Joseph Anzhi the samurais you just got a
beat something yeah what are you gonna
do first we're gonna play with the a.m.
do stuff should I fill this
yeah I guess we should clarify that too
so set up here what we're really doing
is just seeing kind of where we're gonna
stand for the stream and in the stream
we'll push it yeah this is more to just
see how the tip runs and to make sure
everything's working yeah there's some
KP paste on here and there's it's like
he's a frickin fairy you just like
sprinkles it that's how you know if
Vince was somewhere well if you do if
you use that blue paste enough it ends
up everywhere
so this card was pre-tested then which
means if we don't hit the clocks that
Vince knows it can hit yea then he's
gonna yellow he's gonna yeah
so we're gonna have to heat up the pot
so what is it what is it specifically
that told you it's an issue it's being
too cold and not something else because
when I got cold it just stopped
yeah what was it like - 190 or something
I think it was like 180 something okay
this wasn't the one this was a profile I
did before I came up with the last one
but I don't think they're that much
different there we go so - 130 we're
gonna have to go a little bit slower
this time cuz memory is not having fun I
think let's see if we can get rid of
these cold shake your dragon Eamon here
oh yeah that's right yeah my fingers are
too big once you choose the the CRC
spray much easier than doing that save
it you save it there you go see you
didn't get enough did you and it's been
marked that mean anything to you Jeff
2190 Phil that's kind of how I was
reading it so without that the BIOS all
three BIOS has run the same power limits
knocked all 360 watts and then there's
an X OC BIOS you can apply that's
unlimited there's no power line so under
the stock bios is without any voltage
changes because you run into the power
law wall once you start changing the
voltage the clock seems to sit at about
like 20 160 2190 which is what that says
and 2205 it can't sustain it so I'm
thinking that's this is good till about
20 190 I'm here anyway there's the
kingpin PCB before and after if you
wanted to comparison that's what does
that come in the box for today no that
would be cool if it did that was really
cool we did it with the dart boards they
do yeah but this is a Vincent in gave
this to me when we visited their lab I'm
mad at bit I didn't get one so all the
thermal paste on there
so I'm just doing this because this was
sitting on a spot on a table where there
was a bit of liquid metal and I'm just
trying to make sure there's no liquid
metal on the card that could cause
something to short and kill it but we
are good to go now if you waste at all
no there's a lot in there so you know a
hairdryer something no how can I have
all that hair how do you not have a
hairdryer nice it it makes poofy makes
it perfect we have too much of voltage
yeah I think I just didn't have a good
mount yesterday so I'm actually in
what's called a retry button so
basically it's gonna try the same
settings this is for like to get past in
memory training so like if it doesn't
boot up once let's try it again
let's try it again let's try it again
cuz actually if you do it a bunch of
times it actually might go through
that's what builds ride was telling me
once he had me doing some testing for
him and I was like how many times should
I try these settings and he said how
long do you want to stand there and push
the retry button yeah it worked it did
take like 15 retries but it did work it
still runs but it just acts crazy like
you were like are you be like I don't
know what to troubleshoot and you pull
it apart and there's a ton of water
right so much condensation port is
soaked
yeah cuz I don't you gotta be careful
you can't really if you try to take the
pot off when it's cold it's frozen to
solid
you'll break stuff right I've seen
people where like they try to take it
like see the memory is so frozen you try
to take that out and sometimes I've seen
people actually rip out the whole like P
Pocket with it yeah okay that's the last
thing you want to do especially on
really good memory so all the water is
gonna end up in the socket do you do
anything about that you're like oh I'm
good I'm gonna basically heat up the
whole board I just want to get the
memory out yeah you said you have a sake
hitter you want me to pull mine out no I
have one I'm just trying to help Joe oh
now he's trying out what about all those
other times Steve well I knew you would
say you wouldn't need any help so figure
that off yeah like he was still in a
socket nice oh yeah this is what I call
the hotbox
usually I you I put a hairdryer on it
and let it let it go and then come back
in like ten minutes and it's completely
dry okay yeah I think we need more
Vaseline and I think that's probably
also killing us so for the vast you're
just going to spread it over everything
except it does not go in any of the
sockets right yeah the sunblock the pen
come back well I don't have to worry
about it too much in like pcie I mean
when it comes to memory that's like the
big no-no because with for some reason
what memory it basically messes up the
contact I guess another questions here
is uh so the VRMs don't really have much
active cooling other than whatever
allons you kind of steams over the side
well these VR M's like that's the
actually the big thing about this board
of the new crosshair versus the old one
is the VR M is a way more it's much more
beef here and it runs cooler still when
you're doing liquid nitrogen stuff
especially since it's it's higher
wattage then say like old for quarries
and stuff you still want to have some
type of cooling but with liquid nitrogen
and these VR rims it's good enough to
pretty much cool with just this and
here's a good rule oh yeah good torch
when your torch doesn't light means
there's no oxygen so nitrogen will if
there's too much other nitrogen you
won't have oxygen so if you can't light
your torch then you know you need to get
out right get out of the room that's the
best way to tell because you're always
using that have you ever actually
encountered that problem like are you so
okay so in the Gigabyte OC lab we had
about like I think eight or nine of
these things now and it's a fairly small
room I mean it was probably I'd say from
that side to here knows that it's like
20 feet or so Oh 20 feet and it wasn't
that big of a room but all of a sudden
like all of us started feeling kind of
weird and we started and none of us
could light a torch so I was gonna you
got to be very careful so what did you
guys just leave after that no we ended
up no we don't you don't stop we got to
do we do this for days but we basically
ended up just like opening up the door
and then just getting ventilate okay
basically dependent oxygen I mean that
should work just as well yeah it works
what happened it the way it happens I
was build to it described it to me is
you feel dizzy and then you die like
there's no in-between so just see this
this this is a perfect example of why
when I give Patrick a job and I say will
you do this you're better at it than I
am this is why he's superior at things
like cleaning up I gave him this board I
would do it $1,800 board right yeah and
I was like make sure those pins don't
get bad we don't have a socket cover and
so he just made his own side
I would have just left it open and then
your genius not in half later I'd be
unbending 4010 you know how you could
clean that really well what give to me
that's everything he gave me I think
that's the first one some of us have
evolved and are capable of using tools
you see how awesome this is now I can
just wheel it over there oh yeah fuck
you
uh-uh hold the tube oh yeah actually you
can just hold it over here okay right
there obviously don't just wait till
that initial pressure comes off you see
that like tendrils coming down
Joe do you want this be kind of funny
okay we're gonna chicken clucking that's
tinkles it's just chicken clock ticking
clock yeah I mean we're just gonna step
it up a little bit oh you're just kind
of like baby steps like you're you're
being scared well no I just wanna be
good I just want to make sure it's yeah
I think was better than Italy so while
Joe was doing more that I'm going to
just start seeing if this is going to
line up for the Helen to pot for the
kingpin card and working on the medium
odd mass you can find on store the
cameras Texas done that but um so yeah
we've got four screws to mount that
plate the pot and then the next question
is does it fit the card so this is gonna
be raised so whatever you do see how
it's uh huh that piece of stick
so you're still have yeah okay good a
certain amount of distance in there so
when you're putting it on like this it
should be good okay so this will when
it's done it'll be like through here yes
okay and then on the other side of this
uh-huh because you gotta figure the
cards are gonna go on like that
yeah and then you connect it in it okay
yeah but I don't like those little small
ones I usually have I I do you have
Romans did Roman ever son you want no he
didn't send me anything I always use his
I have his so I do a combination the
same same thickness no well the problem
is is trying to get a mouse with four
points you because you have to have that
perfect flat again and trying to do it
if you have eight points it gives you
more room to like make sure it's more
accurate okay because I was talking to
him about it the other day like only if
you looked at my other pots like my old
KP ones I have all eight point mounts
and I actually modified it I use a
special plate to keep it close to eat
and I would actually give better mounts
that way okay so that way I wouldn't
have to keep on taking it off putting it
on taking it off
like that when we got here this morning
in the parking lot first thing joe said
was I have my pot in my backpack
that's like I've got this my own two pot
there it is now it really looks like a
gun it's not like a magazine hops in the
top or something okay so we're all set
up for the most part this needs Vaseline
still but we've got the pot on there and
Joe's been working on getting the system
back to life but we do did you have
multiple chips and we will get it back
we're just trying to burn off the L&amp;amp;T
right now right yes sir and then get it
booted so this is the prep process it's
gonna be all day so much fun all day of
this and by the time we get to the
stream we'll have it pretty dialed and
you'll just get to see the fun part so
check back it will be at 1 p.m. est
we'll put up some other times on the
screen for other time zones
alternatively because some people forget
that you can do this you can check
Google so if you go to goog le comm you
can type in 1 p.m. est to the time zone
you are in that would also work but is
it daylight savings time that's here
soon check back Saturday that's gonna be
well at the time this video goes up
it'll be less less than 24 hours from
the time this video goes live so and
then the cane pin card will be doing on
Sunday so there'd be nothing separately
that is going to be rising 2,700 X with
just like a 1050 and it's because we're
only doing CPUs probably Cinebench and
then this will be maybe portroyal or
something out we're not fully decided on
it yet but two separate streams both at
1:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time Saturday
on Sunday so thanks for watching check
back soon and subscribe for more as
always you get a store like Aaron's
Nexus dotnet support directly and we'll
link bearded Hardware down below as well
I have my side to 30 hardware calm
bearded hardware calm and we'll see you
in the livestream</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
