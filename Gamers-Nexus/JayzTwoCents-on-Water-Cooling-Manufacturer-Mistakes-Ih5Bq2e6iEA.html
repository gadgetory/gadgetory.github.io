hey everyone I'm here at LTX with Jay
from Jay's two cents and we're going to
be talking about water cooling
specifically common or major mistakes
that the manufacturers make rather than
common mistakes the consumers make right
because you said before we started
filming I thought a good thing which was
the manufacturer sort of set the
consumers up for failure in some
instances it's true before that this
video is brought to you by Dollar Shave
club's daily essentials starter set this
full grooming kit ships at $5 and
includes a trial sized versions of the
companies that popular shave butter body
wash and wipes and also includes a solid
high-quality razor and a full set of
cartridges go to dollarshaveclub.com
slash gamers Nexus to get the daily
essentials starter kit for just $5 and
with free shipping or click the link
below so I've got about 18 years of
water cooling experience in the rear and
to back up that claim of mine we were
using parts at work meant to be used in
computers way back when we were taking
heater cores that of junkyards turning
them into heat exchangers we were just
taking regular 120-millimeter even 200
millimeter fans from like the old you
know cooler master cases and stuff
aquarium water pumps vinyl tubing from
Lowe's like everything was wrong right
and just using straight distilled water
and I remember thinking we didn't deal
with clogs and failures and stuff back
then even with mixed metals right
because I think what's happened over
time is I realized over the last let's
say two and a half three years I've seen
more water cooling failures in terms of
gunking up and clogging than I have in
the last you know 15 prior to that and
it really gets me to thinking that a lot
of the companies that are kind of trying
to push themselves in the market into
this new it's not even new but water
cooling is much more mainstream than it
used to be and I think they all want a
piece of that that pie and what they're
doing is unfortunately cutting a lot of
corners lacking a lot of long-term
testing and so what happens is as a
consumer you think you're getting a
product that's ready for primetime that
may not have been like specifically like
the Primo chill view thing yeah so I
thought that's the basis of my claim is
we didn't see these types of failures in
the day yeah and I could already see
comments arguing that
well but it's more mainstream now but
the point is as it's gotten more
mainstream right manufacturers I think
some of them have gotten sloppier in
creating the product because people are
gonna buy it anyway its yields right yes
you sell more units make more units at
the lesser cost make more profit and the
problem is you'll start to see people
cutting corners and using lower grade
copper higher oxidization levels and and
and what happens is you start there's
dirty copper this coppers with all sorts
of inks and alloys and other things in
there that are content potentially
contaminants if the fluid that you're
using is not meant to be able to inhibit
those types of corrosion and so what
happens is you get these these products
that are not necessarily compatible and
the reason why we don't have these
problems in the past was just because of
plain distilled water yeah and most
people have moved away from that because
I remember the early days I can remember
than the product name now it's been too
long but there was the first like
non-conductive fluid and it was actually
the very first water cooling test I ever
conducted I'd actually did it on hard
for him it was long to remember there
and I had a loop that I used for six
years that I'd never been serviced I had
never flushed it never drained it never
replaced it it the tubing turned from
clear to like a peach color was really
good it was a green coolant but it
turned peach but what I wanted to see
was how conductive did this turn turn
over times as it's running over metals
it's picking up ions and contaminants
and becoming conductive so I took my
multimeter and I tested it various
distances like in the bowl obviously
it's you know same captioned
surprisingly it was fairly conductive up
to six inches away which is at that
point any lick any leak you're screwed
yeah so that really started the
discussion of even the non conductive
fluids are only a temporary solution
yeah and so my question for you then as
a genuine question not just pitching it
for camera but if there is a a concern
of how long the fluids are in the loop
how much of that do we put on the
consumers so like like a car right at
some point it's your fault for not
taking care of it right so at what point
do we pass into it is the consumers
fault for not taking care of it versus
the manufacturer just didn't think it
well I mean there's general
rule-of-thumb and then there's
manufacturer recommendations which it's
funny because the manufacturer
recommendation usually is a much longer
term than my rule of thumb and we got
another floatplane coming in no pun
intended and that is because of the fact
that I tend to annually change my fluids
spoiler though I haven't changed
skunkworks in two years because I'm
still long-term testing the green fluid
because I was dealing with the color
change on yellow and orange after two
years the Green has not changed color on
me so two years it hasn't changed color
two years it hasn't changed color but
the funny part is like and that's a
man's pastel and the thing is they'll
they'll say it's it's got a five year
shelf-life I think it is and recommended
two plus years to be able to run in your
system so that's falling within that
recommendation but any systems I built
for friends or family I live and die by
the the one year rule six months on
distilled water if it's just got a PT
nuke or a kill coil or a one year if
it's some sort of like a premix and I'm
not adding any additives to it but but
then you have like silver kill coil
something I want to talk about okay
the kill coil the silver is an anti
corrosive right and the problem is
though the silver becomes an issue in
responds and reacts to various types of
metals that you may not be our wearer in
your radiator or your block and stuff
because you start to get these lower end
companies like from China and a lot of
these these no-name brands that are
cutting corners using lesser quality
alloys that then the silver actually
becomes the problem in the loop so you
think you're doing the typical this is
the right way and you're setting
yourself up for failure yeah
because again confusion in the market
because now everyone wants to be a water
cooling supplier and all you've done is
create this just mass confusion of parts
compatibility yeah yeah absolutely I
think another thing also that's worth
going over is just as vendors like
incoming as vendors have tried to expand
their market reach you've got companies
like ek doing aluminum for loops now and
stuff like that and that's but they're
doing it the right way yeah guys all
aluminum because it's all aluminum all
the way down to the fittings right what
a lot of people don't realize is they're
concerned about mixed metals all AI OS
are mixed metal yeah I mean all of them
are pretty much running either a Sutekh
aluminum rads or
some other aluminum radiator with that
they also have biocides in them too now
and somebody asked me that earlier that
I met here at LTX it was the one
question they had they're like you say
mixed metals is bad but we're about a
iOS I say that pump is probably gonna
die long before then you know you'll
come across galvanic corrosion because
they the fluid is sealed and formulated
for that set up it's done right anyway
yeah
but the the problem is a lot of people
don't realize like fittings and stuff
those are brass those are brass fittings
with nickel plating on them the nickel
usually will eat away on the inside of
the fitting or it may not be plated at
all it might just be on the outside so
you already have fluid touching brass
and then nickel bare copper I mean you
are in a mixed metal situation almost no
matter what I was always aluminum's the
the one people freaked out about right
because I thought about it for a lot of
reasons I'm like one of them is thermal
conductivity too and we've we've
actually tested a like one to one
comparison of copper versus alumina the
chalasis just I just did straight just
straight thermal benchmarking with an
identical system and it's it's pretty
hard to find a difference in a lot of
instances right it's like you get
there's definitely a thermal difference
in terms of heat capacity and stuff like
that because it the thermal conductivity
of copper is two times of what it is on
aluminum yeah but to actually gain
anything out of that you need to have a
hell of a lot of the thing is that but
that's at max thermal capacity and
thermal transfer rate there are pcs and
the temperatures at which we're
conducting you know the actual transfer
of heat is far below that that Headroom
so you're not gonna usually find you
have other bottlenecks to it because
people people look at that data and they
say well that means an aluminum loops
gonna be twice as hot as a copper loop
and that's just not true
but I think people freak out about
luminol unnecessarily and let's see the
thing about the the 240g kit and stuff
from UK is the fact that it's the same
grade of aluminum being used because
just like anything else there's so many
different grades and alloys of aluminium
and you start mixing those you can have
a problem but every single car on the
planet has mixed metal loops running all
day long and the reason why they don't
fail is because they have a regular
service schedule and they have a fluid
that is designed for that that
automotive application which is why
you'll see GM recommend one thing
Chrysler recommend another you know
Nissan recommend and
there and the important thing is you
have to at least know the
recommendations for the part you write
on the manufacturer side other than
fluids is there anything that has caused
you concern lately or that you've
disliked from vendors who make these
components okay we've got a couple
components right we have pumps we have
cold plates fittings are a big one for
me fittings if everyone wants to have a
rotary fitting now of some sort and bits
power is still my go-to because they and
they've fun fact they have never
sponsored a single fitting for me I
actually get most of those from
performance PCs and and because there
they are the most expensive fittings on
the market but they have the tightest
fitting the best tolerances in terms of
having oring so any o-ring you add to
your system is another point of failure
which is a potential concern you start
dealing with double rotary 90s or just a
single rotary 90 or 45 and you start
adding those each one of those junctions
becomes a place that can leak so because
they have the best failure rate
everything fails everything's got a
failure rate guys but because there's
there spec is so tighten and the
tolerances are so good sometimes it's
hard to turn them I use them
specifically for that reason because you
have a lot of people that copy the best
and you have a lot of the the the
knockoff brands and the China brands and
you know Shenzhen and all that stuff
making these these components that are
look-alike for the main the main real
deal they're a lot looser they don't fit
as tight and I've seen so many of these
fittings fail in a system that's not
moving just it's together it's not
moving you're not touching it and just
over time they use all the way down to
they cheap out on the quality of the
o-ring material you've seen the brute
the red o-rings in the brown o-rings
right each of those are a different type
of material and the reason why you you
see fittings be expensive is because
they're not cutting the corners and that
falls on the manufacturer you could do
everything right for your system
together a hundred percent correct but
it failed because of a substandard
material that was used exactly yeah
which is a problem in a lot of places
too so I guess if if anyone's had second
guesses about overpaying for fittings or
any component that loop there's a reason
you pay so much another thing too is
just their low volume parts rightly
liquid cooling is grown a lot
certainly your channel is proof of that
and the it's still though a much lower
volume than anything else we work with
in terms of light you know
hyper 212 yeah like millions of those
days yeah and it's a it's unfortunate
though that a lot of people are afraid
to do their custom loops because of the
idea of these failures yeah
okay so then closing this one out to
that point of people being afraid of
doing custom loops because of failures
even with like CLC as you see this -
yeah I guess I should first know anytime
there's a failure you're way more likely
to hear about it than if it's the
success right like Paul talked about a
loop failure I've talked about loop
failures and you hear about those
because it's like catastrophic I know
and I've been fortunate enough to not
have a catastrophic like explosion of a
thing like and that's that's why I say
fittings is the other frustrating thing
is in both of those instances see Paul's
failure was was fluid related and one we
already talked about right with the view
Kyle's failure was with specifically
with a fitting that just randomly popped
off and that again comes down to
material of the o-rings
how tight are they one of the reasons I
use prima chills so much on my revolver
fittings for hardline is because they
have the tightest seal they have two
o-rings and when when they seal you have
one that's responsible just for the seal
you have another what's responsible for
the bite on the collar so that it can't
slip out so that should should people
actually be afraid of building an open
loop it's the same thing I tell anyone
that asked me that question is if you're
willing to assume the risk there's
always some level of risk you know it's
for me it's an enthusiast thing I feel
like the efficiency of the hardware the
temperatures that have reduced and how
good vapor chambers have become and how
good air coolers have become it's not
necessary for 99% of the people out
there I still do it because it's just an
enthusiast thing for me but if you are
willing to assume the highly unlikely
event of a catastrophic leak then yeah I
highly recommend it should you be
nervous I'm always nervous I mean most
all my loop every system I have is water
cool and even our business systems which
is probably not the smartest move
because in terms of maintenance and
stuff but yeah I don't think you should
be afraid
honestly so if you want to see more of
this check out Jays channel Jay's two
cents will link him below thank you okay
thank you very much thank you Steve
good good yeah yeah absolutely we'll see
you all next time
