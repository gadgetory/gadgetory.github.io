with a hardware tip today we're going to
look at DVI dual link cables and what we
want to focus on today is if you buy a
dual link cable for three five six
dollars you might not be getting the
dual link that you think you're getting
let's say that you buy a DVI dual link
cable and it looks something like this
notice the thickness of this cable
versus this cable over here when you
plug your DVI dual link cable in if
you're only using say 1920 by 1080
resolution you may not notice it but
when you push to higher resolutions
you're probably not going to be able to
get that picture we want to make sure it
gamers Nexus here that you don't get
ripped off so we're going to show you a
little tip on how to test this out if
you look at these two things you got DVI
dual link on my left hand and DVI single
link on my right hand the connectors are
clearly different and what's happening
is we're missing some pins right here in
the middle these missing pins are
actually missing in the wire section as
well so if we look at this DVI dual link
cable you may get a dual link cable that
is a thin cable instead of a thick one
and may have the right connector on it
but then no wires for that connector to
connect to so what you can do is you can
take a digital multimeter like this guy
right here
I got a fluke you can take a you know
twelve dollar version from advanced
autoparts or whatever other place you
want to go to and they'll do the same
thing just need to use the resistance
setting here we have a continuity test
which creates a nice little audible beep
for us when we complete a circuit like
that so what we're going to do is we're
going to line these two DVI connectors
up side-by-side with a little help and
then we're going to actually try and do
some connectivity so you take both ends
of your multimeter and just tap one end
like this
tap the other end like this and you get
that nice audible beep that means that
you've got connection so the places that
you're really really interested in are
columns for and columns v because that's
your dual link and so what we're going
to do here is we're going to just simply
take our probe touch it to the first pin
on column 4 and then touch it to the
first pin over here on column 4 and we
got a nice audible beep that means
we got connectivity therefore there's
definitely a wire going from this column
for pin one over to this column for pin
one you do that same same goal test
action from column for pin two three
column five pin one two three and then
you can guarantee that you have what you
paid for and again you're probably going
to pay a little more for an actual DVI
dual link cable so while you're testing
if you see something like this I'm going
to just go over here and touch column
one pin one over here and column one pin
one over here notice that I get no
audible beat well that's the kind of
thing that would warn you that you know
what there's no actual wiring between
these two pins on this particular cable
that's not a big deal because it's a DVI
dash D type cable meaning digital only
then this particular guy on that pin
doesn't even need a wire there because
that is an analog signal wire this one's
also missing four other pins inside
around the slotted part of the connector
but those again are also for the analog
signal so don't be too weary if you get
a DVI - D dual link and that column one
pin one doesn't work for your continuity
test because it shouldn't again a have
to download this is again Patrick stone
with gamers Nexus we'll see you guys
