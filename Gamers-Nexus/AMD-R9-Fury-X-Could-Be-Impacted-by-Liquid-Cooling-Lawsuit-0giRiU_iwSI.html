donna and today we're talking about
liquid cooler lawsuits this is an update
on what we've written about previously
on the website so bring everyone up to
speed there's been a number of lawsuits
involving primarily a Sutekh a supplier
of clcs or closed loop liquid coolers
and other companies like cooler master
Swift tech and cool IT in particular so
these companies have all been involved
in some way or another legally with asa
tech and just catching I've rona up what
they all do is they all supply liquid
coolers so the corsair coolers the NZXT
coolers silverstone all of them are
supplied by one of these companies or
another one like a politic and those use
very similar designs for the most part
which ace attack holds a patent over so
the design in question primarily
pertains to the presence of the pump
located on the cold blade so your CPU
cooler for a liquid cooler you have a
few items you have the cold plate at the
bottom that's the piece of copper that
connects to the CPU it has micro fins
that go up into a basically mini
reservoir where the pump resides the
pump swirls of course has pumps do and
propels liquid through those micro fins
to dissipate heat the heated liquid then
goes up a tube into the radiator gets
cooled off by fans dissipated by the
aluminum fins fed back down another tube
and then it repeats the process so
that's how it works and ASA tech holds a
patent specifically over the cold plate
mounted CPU or GPU pump design and
that's where things start to get a bit
out of control so in 2013 swiftech was
issued ACN the cease-and-desist by asa
tech and that was for the sale of their
h220 liquid cooler in US markets in
response to this swiftech ceased sales
of their HT 20 cooler in the US markets
but continued sales in other markets
outside of the US following this more
recently there was a cooler master
lawsuit and cooler master law
that lawsuit in 2014 at which point asa
tech was awarded four hundred thousand
dollars in damages and a 14.5 percent
royalty on the sale of all relevant
liquid coolers which would include the
side on series the glacier series the
Neptune series and similar liquid
coolers following this there was a cool
IT settlement so it did not go all the
way through the channel like the cooler
master one did cool IT reached a
settlement with asa tech where they
awarded a's attack some amount of cash
for this cessation of their lawsuit and
these lawsuits were both for the same
reason they were both because ace tech
was accusing coolermaster and cool IT of
patent infringement on their design that
we've gone over already and
interestingly cooler master demanded a
judgment on their ruling from 2014 which
was ruled on by a jury and that was
denied just recently as in yesterday or
two days ago at this point and that was
followed up by a hit to cooler master to
the tune of a royalties increased to
twenty-five percent or a bit over that
25 and some change for the continued
sale of cooler master liquid coolers
through the current date so basically
bringing everyone up to speed on the
relevant part coolermaster lost a
lawsuit in 2014 and awarded a Sutekh
damages for the infringement of their
patent on liquid cooling and then
demanded judgment was not awarded that
and has been hit with an additional
penalty for their continued sale of
coolers at this point coolermaster now
is twenty-five percent royalties on
coolers sold from january first this
year onward and they also are no longer
allowed to sell their liquid coolers in
US markets so that's where things get a
bit interesting and that's because of
the recent and the r9 fury x which uses
a cooler master liquid cooler this
cooler master liquid cooler in the r9
puri x is also a cold plate mounted pump
and if you tear it all down it's pretty
similar to a site on 120 liquid cool
or other than the fact that it's square
instead of a circle for the most part so
that's where we're yet unsure if the
lawsuit will impact the sale and
production of AMD r9 fury X video cards
but it is certainly a possibility there
is no reason to be alarmist about it yet
it's not all going down in flames or
anything like that but it is a
possibility for which we should all be
at least paying attention if nothing
else so that's where things stand with
liquid coolers if you're curious about
how this impact the greater liquid
cooling market companies like a politic
have not yet been roped into these legal
battles and that company in particular
supplies the silverstone Tundra the
enermax lick max cooler which I actually
have sitting right here and some lipa
coolers and then there are other
companies of course who also do the cold
plate mounted pump design which could be
called into question so that's sort of
how things are working right now whether
or not this patent is is something that
is good for the industry is not
something we're discussing in the video
here today you are certainly free to
debate that in the comments below but I
will not be commenting on that at this
time because I really need to inform
myself a lot more from all the parties
involved before I can comment on that in
a manner that I determine adequate for a
discussion but in terms of things that
are interesting current and up for
discussion on my end the AMD r9 px
deserve some attention right now because
the potential impact of the lawsuit
coolermaster is getting hit with
additional fines and already owes a lot
of money the sale of their side on and
similar cpu coolers will cease so if you
want one you should get one soon if
you're in the US and then finally and
interestingly ASA Tech has expanded
their patent acquisition they now hold
patents in European and China markets as
well previously was just the US so the
inclusion of these markets could impact
companies like Swift tech who have
gotten away with selling their h220 in
other regions outside of the US and may
now have to reconsider that given the
new patents acquired by isa tech so
that's all for this content if you like
this type of reporting as always check
that patreon link in the post roll video
and leave comments below let us know if
you think we've got some other cool
videos coming up very soon so subscribe
to the channel if you're not already
including some cooling stuff relevant to
this but I'm not talking about the
potentially boring industry legal side
of things more talking on the
performance so that's all for this time
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
