battlefield one we did a couple of
different tests in battlefield one as
you'll see in our benchmark content
which will go live momentarily stay
subscribed for that and we'll be on the
website of course skimmers exits not net
but the idea was to tackle the two main
aspects of battlefield one single player
and multiplayer of course multiplayer is
much harder to benchmark for all the
obvious reasons there's a lot of
variants there are a lot of things we
can't control for other players network
latency to create things like that but
we did our best and put together a
pretty cool benchmark that I think you
will appreciate for its accuracy
consistency while still being able to
compare single-player and multiplayer
performance results so what you're
looking at here we've got a couple of
different gameplay video files from the
multiplayer session or from our
single-player bench course which takes
the first level of the Italian campaign
in the game we walk a straight path for
the normal bench interval repeated three
times for each device for each setting
for each resolutions a lot of tests for
card by the way and for each API to
api's talk about that more in the video
though for the benchmark but walk
through the course there's a lot of
geometric complexity but not too much
there's muscular rays coming down from
the Sun to the trees lots of smoke and
particle effects lots of post-processing
all that stuff pretty intensive
benchmarking scenario without being too
crazy so it's not the worst case
scenario in the game but it's heavy
enough we get a good idea for the
overall rounded performance through
battlefield 1 so this was just the
benchmarking course it was captured this
one particularly at 4k I believe with
higher ultra settings you'll see it in
the video though and then we ran that
with a GTX 1080 FTW hybrid but we ran
another
guard 11 cards total tested the bench
were to check back to that thank you for
watching as always pay challange and
post your video subscribe for more
content leave comments below I'll see
you all next time
