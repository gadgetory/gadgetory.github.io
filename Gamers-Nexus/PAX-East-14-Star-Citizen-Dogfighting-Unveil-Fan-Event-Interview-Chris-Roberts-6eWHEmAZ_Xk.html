thoughts on the presentation today how
are you feeling after everything okay
crash the budget he should have done so
we actually fairly stable back in LA
when I left out I don't know we we used
a different system to bring all the data
that is so so much data in our patching
system and the patching system didn't
bring it down so then we had a big
scramble fade away but it looks great so
if you look around like you looked on
the monitors look at this stuff paying
is the best-looking speech thing you've
ever seen and like the fidelity and the
resolution is crazy so I'm trying to get
when these monitors up so people can
actually see it in 4k because they can
get really up close to see all this
stuff yeah I mean look at that it's like
they're shipping all its glory so yeah
is it all idea is to make it like a
completely like a most of your the
cockpit or all this is like property for
simulation so that's like stuff like
your buddy when you're moving around so
but I wish the multiplayer test went
better and any any closing ball through
your fans here today yeah all I would
say is thank you very much for
supporting and backing because we get to
make this game I'm going to make it like
the best possible game that though like
compromises and you're all very patient
even when it crashes which is nice I
hope your patient when it crushes then
if that's the problems like show you
stuff so early development
of course well thanks again for your
time I know you're busy we will c UI UI
