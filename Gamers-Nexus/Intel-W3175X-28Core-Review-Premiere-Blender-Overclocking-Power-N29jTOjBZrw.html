one of the most scrutinized parts at
copy tax 2018 after being unveiled as a
5 gigahertz 28 core part with a chiller
behind the scenes but it has since
evolved into a real product that has a
lower price point than expected and it's
still overclockable so it's actually an
unlocked Xeon this isn't the rumoured
$4,000 and certainly not the rumored
$8,000 that we saw online but instead a
$3,000 Xeon CPU with twenty eight cores
it's about a grand more than the 18 core
99 ATX II and then the AMD 2990 WX today
we're benchmarking the 31 75 X in
premiere blender Photoshop gaming
workloads and of course we're
overclocking it before that this video
is brought to you by thermal grizzly and
their high-end thermal compounds thermal
grizzly makes cryo not paste for high
thermal performance and conductivity
without being electrically conductive so
you don't have to worry about shorting
components Crona is particularly good
for replacing stock GPU pastes as cryo
not is a non curing compound learn more
at the link in the description below the
31 35 X is sort of difficult part to
review because it's one really expensive
there are two motherboards that go with
it a gigabyte board and the Asus dominus
which is what we used and the dominus
isn't even supposed to be available via
retail it's going to be an SI board a
system integrator board for my pc
building companies CyberPower at all and
those companies from what we understand
spend about $1,700 on the board but we
don't have an actual price from Asus
because it's not a consumer part it's
not a retail part so that leaves us with
this thing which is a very impressive
piece of hardware by all accounts the
motherboard is impressive the CPU is
impressive despite what you may think
based on its price or otherwise as a
part stand-alone ignoring all other
factors they are impressive it's just
that it's going to be difficult to to
purchase for a number of reasons like
price or availability of the CPU or the
board so it does make it a bit difficult
but we're going to be focusing on some
of the production tests in case you
really care about those
and then we're also pushing some of the
overclocking angle a bit because that's
really where we think this one's going
to be the most fun and for that reason
we have a live stream which you should
have already seen and announcement in
the bottom for that that'll be the day
this video goes up which is Wednesday
that whatever date that is we'll put it
on the screen and we're gonna probably
stream at about 6 p.m. Eastern Time in
the US for that so check back for the
live stream we're gonna be putting it
under a chilled water and seeing how far
the CPU can overclock but we did there's
some overclocking on these solutions on
the table so this is an ace attack
solution it is a sort of hacked together
cooler that ASA tech did we we learned
about this years ago but did not know
the processor it would be used for at
the time and the reason attacked
together is because if you know other
ACE attack coolers it's got the same
sort of pump block and the same size
cold plate as previously except it's
going on a CPU that's almost exactly the
size of a thread Ripper CPU that's the
size of the 3175 X so this is not the
best solution but it's supposed to be
more affordable I don't know the price
of it because I think this is also an SI
part so I don't know what more
affordable means but it's mostly more
affordable than an ek solution and ours
unfortunately one of them got damaged in
shipping but this would be an ek
solution as an example and we saw these
at CES just recently so the asa tech
cooler then in order to overclock on
this thing the affordable one whatever
that may mean we had to push noise
levels to 70 decibels and as you can
tell it's excruciatingly Li loud and
then we also had to use a few tricks so
in BIOS there's a setting that allows
you to increase t.j.maxx to the maximum
temperature per core we increased that
to at least 90 degrees we might push it
higher during the stream high up to 100
and it gets a bit dangerous but t.j.maxx
stock is 85 degrees Celsius which is
extremely limiting for overclocking but
you can get away with pushing and
another 5 degrees for sure and might be
able to do more though we we hesitate to
recommend more than that with an extra 5
degrees that we were able to achieve a
4.5 gigahertz clock and and our
definition of achieve means it passes
all tests so this includes blender with
a V
workloads not just games if we just did
games we'd probably get up much higher
but passing all tests 4.5 gigahertz 30x
mass just for a quick and easy one
didn't really try too hard on that we'll
do that in the stream and we ran all the
memory at 3200 megahertz standard for
our benchmarks it is six channels so he
populated six slots and ran 3200
megahertz for our Corsair Vengeance
memory for voltages we found that we
were able to basically be stable at 1.15
volts it gets extremely hot at these
temperatures so easily 85 degrees easily
throttling at 1.15 volts 4.5 so it's not
really 4.5 increasing t.j.maxx by five
degrees allows you to get away with it
but you're within two degrees to the
point where we ran AC just to make sure
it didn't throttle during testing so
this is a very hot CPU and it's because
it's 28 cores so of course it's going to
be hot it's just like thread Ripper
these the 2990 WX is also a very hot CPU
once you start overclocking it and
that's just from the density of the
parts in the silicon underneath the IHS
another note the 31 75 X is not soldered
so it is using thermal paste we didn't
feel adventurous enough to delete it
before the stream we would like to
hopefully get some value out of it
before risking that type of damage but
you could theoretically delete it and
throw something liquid metal on it we'll
see if there Bauer makes a tool for it
although the volume seems low and this
cooler we'll talk about more later we'll
talk about the cooler in the stream so
the processor itself is what's
interesting by overclocking was pretty
straightforward it's it's skylake X it
is skylake X overclocking all steps are
the same as sky X everything to do with
the 99 80 X C so 90 DX e 7900 X so 960 X
any of those it's the same process for
the 31 35 X for overclocking so let's
get into the benchmarks will talk
premier blender Photoshop here v-ray
games and the power consumption as well
then try and come to some sort of
conclusion our first test uses Adobe
Premiere to encode a real GN clip the
video is an 11 minute truncated GPU
review using only a roll and b-roll
clips at
k60 and rendered at 45 megabits per
second well place some of that file back
now so you can get an idea for what's
being rendered the render is cuda
accelerated it has some limit reese
copes effects applied to it and some
basics but the majority of the work is
still bottlenecking on the cpu we firmly
believe that this is a real-world
scenario knowing most of the tech
youtubers you all watch and what they
use to render and we find this is
representative as a workload piece for
content creators h.264 is used as
YouTube isn't really ready for primetime
on h.265 our experience has also taught
us that premiere really pushes things
like our charts to the GPU but a roll
and b-roll sections are very heavy on
the CPU at least with the clips and the
settings we use here's our results chart
Adobe software in general including
Photoshop really seems to like frequency
premiere like scores more than Photoshop
does but it's still heavily frequency
dependent the Intel I nine ninety nine
hundred K stock CPU completed our render
in 24 minutes or 21 minutes when using
quick sync which isn't available on the
h EDT CPUs that have no I know what that
IGP acceleration helps primarily with
our charted reviews which this is not
but they don't do as much for a heavy a
roll and b-roll video like this one the
Intel I $9.99 ad XE stock CPU completed
the same rendered in 22 percent less
time than the 9900 k with IGP
acceleration with the $3,000 Intel Xeon
31 35 X completing its render in 12
minutes reducing the time required from
the $2,000 980 XE by about 27% how
meaningful that improvement is will
depend upon your use case for
professionals where every single minute
counts like we'll talk about with
blender and thread repair momentarily
that 27 percent reduction could be worth
it in exchange for $1000 that might be
value that gets money back when
considering employee time and all of the
other costs factored in with time for
most of our sort of normal viewing
audience it's pretty rough value when
considering the already reasonable
performance of the 9900 K so it's just
going to depend on how much that time is
worth to the individual or the
organization
for us a 27% reduction would add up to
several hours of render time per week
but for a hobbyist
it's better value to buy something else
like $2.99 hundred K or 8700 K ask for a
thread Ripper it doesn't handle our 4 K
60 clip as competitively as it handles
our blender rendering which we'll look
at next this is an artifact of how
applications are built premieres built
at least with this standard YouTube
ready encoding configuration
it's a favored frequency heavily and
threader fur does fall behind on that
front load balancing isn't as even
across the cores in Premiere as it is
for blender you'll see spikes on
individual cores a lot more frequently
in Premiere and in this scenario Intel
is more consistent as a good bet for our
premiere benchmarking note that Premiere
is hugely complex as a program so it's
possible that there are some filters or
effects were rising does better than
Intel but we have not yet encountered
those in our workloads that we use at GM
for this workload Intel is firmly in the
lead
blender got a lot of mentions in the
premiere section blender is one of the
world's most heavily used 3d modeling
and animation programs and is another
one that we use in the house for our own
3d work Andrew the editor for this video
made our GN intro logo and blender shown
on the screen now which has proven to be
one of the most intensive render scenes
we've ever tested the scene trace is
raised for lighting effects and has high
sample counts for cinema ready quality
Andrew also made our upcoming Ram timing
explanation animations in blender but
will only show a short teaser clip of
those for this review we found that a.m.
these threaded for CPUs tend to do well
with the GM logo animation for which
we'll show some data now the performance
between CVS changes depending on the
type of animation so we have multiple
tests to get a full picture of the
lineup the $3000 31 75 X toxemia
completes the GN logo render in 9.3
minutes functionally equivalent to the
$1,800 2009 TW X and that's not counting
the high board costs for the X 599
platforms where Intel looks very
compelling in the premiere bench and he
looks compelling in the blender tests a
zero point two minute difference or
about 12 seconds is well within error
margins we didn't get a chance to
overclock our loaner 2990 WX
unfortunately
but Intel's 3175 X demonstrates that
there is limited scaling at this level
of performance
even with an OC blender is hugely threat
dependent and cares about threads more
than anything else even a hyper
threading offers great value in blender
as illustrated by the difference between
the 8700 kala 9600 K when both are at
about 5 gigahertz overclocking a 31 75 X
does get a time reduction of 8.6 percent
but the power consumption and noise
increases counter much of that gain
finally for reference the $2,000 990 X
II CPU completes the scene in 13.8
minutes when stock with a 7 idatx II at
4.6 gigahertz completing the scene in 10
minutes if you need to save $1,000 the
2990 WX or 7 idatx you might both be
considerations somebody on the type of
workload although thread Ripper does
have generally good value or better
value in this scenario switching to our
chart for the GN monkey had render the
scene you see on the screen now in the
video anyway we see the performance for
multiple types of rendering effects and
techniques this includes material type
changes transparencies and changes to
roughness and other visual effects to
create realistic stress testing and the
intent I'll deviate more on this
workload than an hour heavily ray-traced
GN logo render with AMD completing the
render in ten point nine minutes on the
2990 WX and intel's 31 75 X completed in
seven point eight minutes for 28% render
time reduction when both are stock the
1980 XE completes the same scene in 11.6
minutes
demonstrating about the 2990 WX
maintains a general lead with thread
count but starts to exchange some of its
lead with Intel at the high end
depending on frequency finally for the
splash render the 31 35 X completes in
about nine point seven minutes with the
2990 WX at eleven point six minutes and
the ninety nine ATX ECB you stock at
eleven point eight minutes that rough
sixteen percent time reduction against
either of the $2000 options is hard to
justify in a lot of instances it's
especially difficult since overclocking
the ninety nine eighty XD gets it to
nearly tie the 31 35 X when its stock
though you could obviously no see that
as well and yet another one minute
reduction it's just a question of if the
business considering this option would
get benefit daily in which instance the
cost may be worth it but it really does
have to be a business to start making
sense and it does have to be something
you're doing it regularly enough with
intensity that these differences make an
impact to the bottom line gaining back
that thousand dollars quickly Photoshop
tends to be more frequency dependent
than anything else as evidenced by this
chart the 99 hundred K is the best value
here by a long shot
- and the 3125 acts only begins to
compete once it's been over clocks to
four point five gigahertz and is
screaming at 70 decibels on the ASA tech
cooler using the puget system Photoshop
benchmark we simply cannot justify the
3175 acts for this use case a much lower
and higher frequency intel part makes
far more sense than these h EDT
platforms there may be photoshop use
cases where it really makes sense like
maybe accompanying photo management
tasks but we could not find them just
with the comprehensive puget benchmark
that we use POV is our last production
test in this benchmark this one position
is the 3175 ex stock cpu at 25 seconds
for multi-threaded elapsed time to
complete the render with the 2990 WX
stock cpu at 27 seconds to complete the
difference is outside of error margins
but generally insignificant the 70 idatx
EE at 4.6 gigahertz completes in twenty
nine point six seconds demonstrating
that the extra threads in the 31 75 X
are put to work overall though the 1000
dollar difference is tough to accept for
these leads overclocking pushes the 31
75 X further up the chart of course
though at the cost of power and
significant noise on the asus net cooler
and then to be fair you can overclock
the others as well like the 29 to WX the
31 75 X holds a bigger lead in single
threaded performance with pov-ray
but then again so does a 9900 case so
we'll just look at multi-threaded here
power consumption is expected ly rather
high with this CPU with blender and
stock settings the 31 75 X ends up
following the turbo duration limitations
set by Intel and followed by Asus with
MCE disabled after the loading period
the power consumption down the EPS
12-volt cables is 312 watts remember
this is a total system power draw so we
are looking at numbers much closer to
actual power consumption of the CPU here
the 2990 WX ran at about 191 watts
during this test or roughly 16 amps this
is the same logo render that completed
in equal times on the 2990 WX and the
3175 x in the previous charts and so
Andy is significantly advantaged
power consumption for this test despite
Intel being significantly ahead and
premier testing since they're tied here
Andy gains the advantage with the lower
power consumption overclocking the 31 25
X gets it up to a staggering 672 watts
which is the highest power consumption
we've yet measured without using an
exotic cooling like chilled water or
liquid nitrogen for perspective a
previous high was the 79 80 XC at one
point to 5 volts at about 548 watts and
then the 2990 WX at one point three
seven volts for 432 watts although
stability was sort of troublesome with
that setting games aren't really the
targeted use case of the $3000 31 75 X
clearly much like they aren't the
intended use case of the 2990 WX but we
always benchmark games it is after all
gamers and axis in f1 2018 at 1080p the
Intel 31 35 X ended up at 290 FPS
average with lows mostly reasonably
timed sans these 0.1% values will look
at frame times in a moment to illustrate
this behavior the average frame rate
positioning ranks the CPU as
functionally equivalent to a 9900 K
stock CPU no human could meaningfully
tell the difference between the average
of 290 and 284 fps though the 0.1% lows
may be a bit more meaningfully
noticeable f1 20:18 like scores more
than most games do evidenced by the
overclocked 3175 managing to land
freshly at the top of the charge with
its 308 FPS average and that's with an
error of the GPU limitations of the 798
exe at 4.6 gigahertz the 9900 K at 5.2
gigahertz further illustrates the thread
favored in f1 as its performance tops
out at 291 FPS average in spite of its
higher frequency frame times are
important here remember that we want to
see a lower number for frame time but
also one which is consistent frame to
frame from one frame to the next we
don't want to see a delta greater than 8
to 12 milliseconds as this becomes
noticeable to the user as a stutter this
is the data that gets smoothed out in
average charts and has even smoothed out
by 1% metrics illustrated in the
previous chart for
frame times we see the 31:35 spike to 20
milliseconds once not too different from
the 9900 K but then again spiking to 35
milliseconds drawing at 8 milliseconds
for a bit and then 34 milliseconds then
it goes back down to 5 milliseconds that
hits 35 milliseconds and so forth
this sporadic behavior is jarring to the
user and although not unplayable the
9900 K is a better experience despite
its overall lower average FPS thread
Ripper also has issues with a lot of the
games if left in creator mode which is
when all of its cores are enabled so
this seems to be a pattern with how
games perceive the massive amounts of
cores of some of these h EDT processors
it may be best like with thread Ripper
to disable some cores or use process
lasso to set the used cores for an
application to ensure that the game is
not getting confused so to speak by the
high core count resolution is the great
equalizer for gaming performance among
CPUs as the task instead becomes GPU
bound at 1440 PF 1 2018 positions the 31
75 acts at 237 FPS average which is
about where the overclocked variants the
9700 K at 5.1 gigahertz and the 9900 K
all also get stuck this is a GPU
limitation Assassin's Creed origins is
up next at 1080p the 3175 x ends up at
133 FPS average stock which is between
the 99 80 XC at 4.4 gigahertz and 9700 K
at 5.1 gigahertz this is another
instance where it is clearly more
sensible to buy a gaming centric CPU for
gaming just like thread Ripper or other
xeon parts before you really shouldn't
buy the 3175 ax for a gaming pc it's
fine for use in a workstation PC that
also plays games but it's really not
suitable for use as a gaming only or
gaming primarily CPU being the most
expensive doesn't make the CPU the best
at gaming though it may help in being
good at its specialized workstation
tasks with some gaming on the side the
31 35 X is capable in this test though
clearly not a distinctive leader when
compared to Intel's cheaper gaming
centric CPUs like the 9900 or 9700 case
cues 1440p shows mostly the same thing
despite being up against the GPU
bottleneck the 3175 ax falls slightly
behind the 900
a likely resultant of lower
single-threaded performance when
considering the night I had a case
higher frequencies civilization 6 will
be our last one for today we have more
gaming benchmarks but as this isn't
really gaming targeted will cap it here
for time
besides the conclusion remains the same
across all the titles civilization 6
looks instead at AI turn time processing
versus fps
which is a more useful metric for grant
campaign or turn-based strategy games
also one of the more interesting unique
and useful metrics for CPU benchmarking
from a gaming standpoint rather than FPS
for this one the 3175 acts technically
chart tops within error margins anyway
at eleven point two seconds when
overclocked to four point five gigahertz
calculated across hundreds of turns and
maybe five AI players this would
certainly add up when compared to for
instance an i3 or an r3 CPU or something
lower down on the chart realistically
though the difference between an eleven
point two second turn completion time
per player at an eleven point four
second time of the 9700 K for instance
isn't going to be noticeable and the
31:35 x stock performance is more
realistically comparable to a ninety
nine hundred K stock again the 31 75 X
does well it's there's nothing wrong
here but it's not like the performance
scales linearly with the money spent at
least not in gaming scenarios like these
so as noted coming to a conclusion on
this is difficult the first they need to
know if you're buying one is that yes it
is hot a few overclock and to the point
that this thing with I don't know if
those are Delta fans I haven't taken
them off yet but with these massive fans
that's been all three together at 70
decibels which is very loud it struggles
to keep it cool at 4.5 1.15 volts and we
had to go up to 1.17 for premiere with
that t.j.maxx offset so it is is
difficult to cool which you need to know
if you're overclocking if you're not
overclocking it's really not so bad
auto fan speeds keep it within spec and
it's not terribly loud but overclocking
is of course one of the major features
and I mean it's it's an enthusiast
overclocking part it's something you do
if you don't care too much about noise
because you're gonna get a lot of it but
as for the the part practically speaking
and premiere does very well it does well
enough where if we had an extra one we'd
probably use it in our own render
machine or maybe when this gets if it
ever does get retired from overclock you
might keep it around just as a backup or
a primary render system because the the
speed uplift and our type of rendering
is significant it's it's less than half
of the time requirement versus a ninety
nine hundred K and it's significantly
reduced versus even on ninety nine
eighty XE so we see scaling and premiere
with cores in a way that doesn't surface
in Photoshop but it still clearly
prefers frequency or some other
architectural edge that intel has
because AMD doesn't do quite as well in
our premiere benchmarks as intel does
especially if you're looking for decor
so very impressive for premiere again
though it's three thousand dollars and
the board is TBD we don't even know if
you're gonna be able to buy either of
these things retail the cpu you probably
should be able to buy retail but asus
tells us that their board is an SI part
and retail might be later so that leaves
you with gigabyte and gigabyte isn't a
hundred percent sure what's happening
what there's either so it makes it sort
of difficult to gauge the value because
we don't know what the combined price is
if the boards are truly going to be over
a thousand dollars your functional price
of the CP is is obviously much higher
than otherwise but it's good at premiere
it's just we don't know if the value is
good because we don't know what the
motherboards will cost but assuming they
aren't over $1000 then a business that
runs premier all day every day would get
value out of the part they the bottom
line would be affected by the speed
increase if you're not a business then
don't buy it
is what it comes down to unless you're
an enthusiast overclocker because the
value just isn't there but i think
everyone probably knows that this is a
business class part the 99 ad XE is
clearly competitive the 2990 WX is
clearly competitive in blender if you're
doing something that's tile based
rendering then and these
for 2990 WX pulls ahead and well in
value anyway and in performance it's
just behind it's functionally tied and
some of our renders and it's it's a bit
behind in some of the others just
depends on which render it is so value
eyes though a thousand dollars less you
might be better off with that I mean you
could buy a couple of them you probably
buy two of the 29 at 90 W X's and 2 4 or
$500 X 399 boards and be very close to
the total cost of one board plus the 31
35 X assuming the board prices are very
high and that's certainly something to
consider because if you can once you're
stacking two CPUs versus one CPU and a
board value goes up tremendously for the
two which would be AMD of this instance
so it's a bit of a trade depend on what
type of workload you're running this CPU
is is good it's just that the price is
really difficult to work with especially
because we don't know what the total
price is going to be so as a product
performance wise the 3175 X is
objectively good it is a leader value is
where we can't say that so in premiere
if you're making money on it then it's
potentially worth it but then again a
ninety nine eighty XE is good and I mean
the ninety nine hundred K with an IG p
and QuickSync is extremely good value so
we can't make that decision for you
you're gonna have to gauge is your
business doing enough videos we're
cutting the render time to the extent
that the 3175 X does is really worth it
and it has to be the right type of video
to because some of them like our charts
are GPU accelerated primarily not really
CPU and you'd have to do some in-house
testing to figure that out
for a consumer versus the twenty nine
ninety and pov-ray and blender the
twenty nine ninety is better value in
Premiere Photoshop well Photoshop beach
by ninety nine hundred k if that's the
only thing you ever do and then or
eighty seven hundred K and then premiere
the 3175 axe again is is in a lead
gaming well I mean kind of who cares
it's fine but it's not a gaming CPU so
you shouldn't buy
for only gaming because there's no value
there but I think everyone knows that
just making sure we're on the same page
so that's the CPU that's that's our
review of it it is very difficult to
come to a conclusion without knowing the
rest of the ecosystem this is an odd
part but a very interesting one it's
just that the value I first of all it is
yeah it's skylake X it didn't get it
didn't get the changes that you might
have thought it would get last year at
Computex it will require chilled water
for us to run it at 5 gigahertz almost
certainly and that's in line with what
we learned at Computex as well so this
is not a part for everybody and it's
it's for a very strict enthusiasts who
are competing and overclocking as you'll
see in our stream that's a small
audience and maybe businesses and in
that instance will defer to you to make
the decision because we don't really
speak with businesses we speak with
consumers so if you're interested in the
part that's how it performs thank you
for watching as always subscribe for
more we don't know what the boards will
cost but maybe once this video goes up
you will so let us know what you think
and you can get a store dock game as
exit sign at the elbows out directly
check back for the stream I'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
