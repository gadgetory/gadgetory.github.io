dotnet we were at cyberpowerpc suite at
CES 2016 with the pro stream or two and
one gaming PC before we get to that all
of our CES coverage is brought to you by
I by powers revolt to small form-factor
gaming PC so the system we have here is
a bit different it's using the fan tax
many XL case that we've looked at
previously and this case is really
noteworthy only for one reason and that
it's it's that it has two mounts for the
motherboards so there's a mini ITX board
at the top and then another board at the
bottom where you can see there's a more
substantial system setup so the top
system in this pro streamer build that
cyberpower is doing is running an aver
media card streaming card in the back
that's a capture card is only one pcie
slot so that's what's being utilized
there and then the bottom the current
setup here for really demo purposes has
29 ATT is but more realistically what
will be sold are the eighteen hundred
dollar skews and up so there's four
total skews eighteen hundred dollars is
the lowest and that one comes with a 970
for the GPU so the price not only a bit
steep but you're paying for two systems
so that's sort of the trade-off and the
CPU on that one at the bottom with the
970 is an i5 6600 k the top is an I 360
360 to twenty one of those and we
already talked about memory with
CyberPower so they have taken into
account the fact that multi-channel
platforms do actually benefit in render
or streaming applications even though
they don't do a whole lot for gaming as
we've tested previously and in the even
the lowest skew it's all multi-channel
and that should assist with rendering if
anyone's doing YouTube content creation
for example as we do so the pro stream
or target market here is really for
users who are trying to use OBS or
xsplit to strength twitch and they
encounter issues with stutter or
shuddering effects in the video as an
artifact of the cpu load so heavy cpu
load from xsplit to do all of that media
processing live and export it to the
internet and because this is running two
systems effectively the same as running
an external system as you would do for
fcat or
xsplit OBS and pre buffering your render
to twitch in this case it's it's that
except in one box so that's really
what's going on with the pro streamer
builds as far as the efficacy how useful
it is in real world it really depends on
how serious of a streamer you are I
suppose if you're trying to make a
living off of it then you would want to
peep out for your stream to ensure that
there is a constant expected quality
you're hitting the bitrate demanded
because you're not going to be falling
behind with the processing from heavy
cpu load where games may demand it in
the instance of sort of more casual or
just having fun streamers something like
this is definitely a bit overkill you
can just stream fine on a single system
but in the the higher tier class it's
worth looking at a multi system
configuration whether or not it's this
particular pro streamer set up so that
is the cyberpower pro streamer set up
we'll be talking about this more in the
future you can check out the article
linked in the description below for more
analysis talked about how all the
streaming tech works how the capture
card works out pre buffers and that'll
all be in the article so check that out
and if you like this coverage as always
hit the patreon link in the postural
video thanks for watching we'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
