Donette and i am joined by david chain
from msi and david is mostly going to
model the card here for us I would say
well we're short here today is our new
gtx 980 TI lightning is a beast of a
card just been released actually
yesterday here at PAX Prime yeah it's
it's a huge card that's why i need a
separate person to hang on to it for me
and the 980 I lightning is targeted at
overclocking so it ships with a pre
overclock it's a 1200 and three
megahertz pre overclock and then the
boost is 1304 or something like that and
it does have overclocking Headroom for
you to actually play around and do some
of your own overclocking of course so
this is I believe the reference 980 TI
is a thousand megahertz that puts us at
200 megahertz overclock which is in
competition with the EVGA hybrid which
is a 12 28 or something in its liquid
cools so this one in terms of cooling
uses air it's got the Tri frozer
solution here it's got three torques
fans which is an MSI fan and you can
read more about that on the website so
three fans sitting on top of course the
giant aluminum heatsink super vibes
actually these are sewer pipes
underneath actually are eight millimeter
pipe to help expensively well the heat
dissipation and those contact with the
GPU itself and then we've got a it looks
like there's a suspension plate here to
help reduce sag of the card and then the
normal backplate that you've all seen
before so this helps reduce the sag of
the video card that's something that we
saw on the MSI 3 90 x as well that I
just reviewed and then there's your
normal back plate with the Lightning
branding in terms of branding it's also
got an LED RGB LED setup that you can
configure through windows through
software this is actually called mystic
light so we actually you could go in and
control the lice yourself out of the way
we totally want full RGB yeah so that's
called mystic lights lights yeah it's
actually available on all of our new
gaming products go all possible
motherboards as well
so that is the msi 90 I lightning I was
told yesterday that one of the more
professional overclockers has achieved
upwards of 1900 megahertz which is
really truly absurd so we're going to
try to look at this do some of our own
overclocking and for more information
hit the link in the description below
for the article and I will see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
