into this build a lack of magnetism a
lack of lighting on the show floor of a
convention center and some surprises in
between Coolermaster allowed us to build
in the brand new cosmos see 700p case a
modular chassis with an invertible or
rotatable motherboard tray live at PAX
West after being faced with some
challenges along the way we recruited
cooler masters way to turn it into a
collaborative a-team build and honestly
it was one of the most fun builds I've
done in a while and the pressure of time
meant that we were both taking turns
dropping screws and reworking our
aspects of the build to get it together
the quickest and the cleanest this was a
real PC build there were unplanned
changes parts that I wasn't familiar
with and sacrifices made along the way
before I get into that this is coverage

to pick up a shirt all said and done the
enclosure is exceptionally easy to work
with in every single panel can be
removed with relative ease so we were
able to strip down the case to
bare-bones to the build our biggest time
sink was asking to invert the
motherboard tray to face the other side
since we thought that adds some flair to
the build this process isn't
intrinsically difficult it's not like
it's challenging mentally but it does
require removal of a lot of screws after
all the entire case can be flipped and
there are a lot of structural elements
there the motherboard tray detached is
by removing four to six screws on the
backside followed by six screws in the
rear of the case followed by a few more
screws around the shrouds we got some
help for this process as the case is one
of the first working samples of the C
700p there's not yet a manual for which
screws have to be removed or in what
order once the trade pulls out the back
adventurous users could pre install the
motherboard tray before reinserting it
though we did the old fashioned way and
built in the case after all it's large
enough that you're not going to be
constrained for space here's the next
bit the entire drive shroud the power
supply shroud the drive rails even can
flip to face the other side this allows
the
two nearly perfectly a mirror its stock
configuration or left side window the
big downside here is that it does take
time even with help inverting the
enclosure took about 45 minutes it'll be
faster and in environments when you have
some time to read the process and you've
got more light than a camera light but
ultimately the bottleneck will be
finding and removing all those screws
you're only building on a PC once
generally so this downside can be at
least somewhat reconciled by the fact
that you're only going to have to do it
one time it's just worth noting that
it's easy but it's not fast we
ultimately left the power supply shroud
out of the case it would have made kale
management a hell of a lot cleaner but
Coolermaster let us use their mij 1200
watt power supply which if you look it
up on Amazon there's a $1,000 80 plus
titanium power supply being that this is
definitively the best power supply we've
ever laid hands on it seemed wrong to
hide it so this psu shroud was left off
power supply would be powering the
thread Ripper build that clear master in
handy provided jointly it's a 1950 X
build there is a Zenith asu's
motherboard in it that we've recently
praised highly to our x5 ease which
admittedly don't quite fit with that
power supply but it's an AMD and
threader for styled build and once
completed looked decent for a showroom
floor we would have liked to run two
standalone PCIe connectors to the 580 is
just as a side note but neither is going
to be drawing enough power under stock
configuration to cause problems on a
single connector that's daisy-chained
for a show system we cared more about
the cable cleanliness and about what was
technically the better option for
routing the cables we had to fight some
tube length issues given the sheer size
of the C 700 P you'll want something
with longer tubes normally but the
upshot is that we did get to try both
the top and front mounting orientations
for the top cooler master uses a
removable cage for mounting fans and
radiators which we ultimately used for a
3-1 40 millimeter fans this cage mounts
by just two screws in the top of the
case and then it hinges outward for
removal and is situated underneath the
dust filter directly which can also be
pulled by hand to remove and
the fact that it's so easily accessible
means that the cage actually serves its
purpose of making the process faster and
ultimately cleaner to execute my
teammate mounted the radiator front side
while I handled the fans and video cards
front side the front panel and dust
filtration panel are both removed by
late pol and grant immediate access to
the radiator mounting cage in the front
as for video cards those were oriented
with the shroud upward part of our
decision to invert the layout the
downside is that the layout was an
upside down CLC logo but upward facing
GPUs gave us something different to look
at so it's a fair trade we've worked
with inverted cases in the Raven 0/2
from Silverstone and Corsair 600c in the
past and both of those cases have one
thing critically in common that is that
they both received high acclaim on
gamers Nexus and in our reviews as we
got further into this build if we
decided that it was worth inverting the
tray after all it looked interesting and
unique and should perform interesting
from a thermal perspective but we'll get
into that more when we have the case
review ultimately having fought with a
third of her socket that didn't quite
want to thread to blank that was nearly
too short but did ultimately make it and
cable link that was potentially a
challenge for a show build where we were
trying to manage things cleanly but
quickly we realized that we now had a
mess of cables that we had to try and
conceal this was the nature of a
time-pressured build where we were
cutting corners and trying to get done
in time for our shadow of war meeting
side note sorry we didn't make it
fortunately cable management was easy we
salvaged velcro ties from the $1,000
power supply and tidied it all up and
then way came in and stuck the cable
shroud on the shroud meant that the
backside was nearly spotless of cables
as you can see in our completed mural
footage the power supply shroud
definitely could have helped on the
front of the case and we did have five
RGB fan headers going into the board so
if that doesn't really help either but
again it's a pretty unique power supply
we wanted to show it off so for such a
quick build and for how large the case
is which means more direct and visible
cable runs the result really wasn't too
bad
case managers cables easily the cable
management bar in the rear is
particularly useful and as where we
bound the cable bundles before hiding
them with the shroud as for the
challenges well most of them it revolved
around the environment the case specific
challenges though included short cable
runs with the rear panel RGB hub they
didn't quite reach where we wanted them
when inverting the motherboard tray we
probably could have made it work
eventually given enough time and
finagling but we'd like to see
coolermaster add another engine to that
cable run we aren't sure if Coolermaster
is planning to do this already but it
might also be wise to include a couple
of eight pin eps 12-volt extenders
ideally two given thread Ripper and X to
99
for normal orientations the cable length
will be longer for those normal
orientations on my converted NZXT to
this previously with their phantom 820
which was one of the last major huge
cases that we reviewed and we've since
been fans of the idea for full towers
the last major challenge was just the
motherboard inversion process it's a
good chunk of time to get it right and
there's some effort that'll happen along
the way but the result is worth it
just budget an extra 30 to 40 minutes to
get it perfect tube length should be a
consideration for closed loop coolers
this isn't a fault of the case
inherently it's just the reality of a
full tower the aware of tube length
check the specs before you order and you
should be fine we'll try to measure out
small lengths once we have one in for
review and can actually take the time to
measure it all out the case came
together nicely and being primarily full
tower users @dn looking forward to
reviewing it properly thermals will be
particularly interesting the front
intake is technically largely blocked
off but the case is also massive and
there's plenty of breathing room in the
bottom the sheer size of the case will
also benefit thermals just by way of
getting thermal mass farther away from
components and having options to draft
the air in through the bottom of the
case so we'll check all that out in the
full review but for now this was your
first look of the case we're more or
less at review status already just
missing on the thermals and the noise
element noise should be pretty low it's
large pieces of metal and glass and
there's help eliminate issues with high
frequency wavelengths and the front even
has some
damping material in it so we'll check
all that out once we have it as always
