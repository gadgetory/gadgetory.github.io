and this is going in a corner that's
basically unused we have a table and two
chairs it's never used for anything and
we had all the foam paneling on the wall
that took a really long time to put up
but we've torn it down and now this
thing which is like a I guess a vinyl
wall mural is gonna go up here and
hopefully the resolution is high enough
on it that we're going to be able to get
kind of a fake brick wall and then the
plan is for the b-roll set you roll
being the filler video we use a product
the hope is to put some shelves up put
some plants up and get a different theme
than the normal electronics and workshop
look that we have on the other side of
the room so we're gonna start with this
thing and it looks like it really sucks
to do before that this video is brought
to you by coarser and it's void Pro
headset the void Pro headset is
available on wired or Wireless versions
with the wireless option supporting a
boosted range upwards of 30 to 40 feet
the headset has full RGB LEDs on the ear
cops has 50 millimeter headphone drivers
and lasts up to 16 hours on battery it
can also be plugged in for Wired at use
and is now lower in price than when it
first launched a noise cancelling
microphone is also included along with
an easy mute indicated by an LED and you
can learn more at the link in the
description below so the goal of this
project is to create a dedicated video
filming area for products b-roll and
that's got two advantages one it gives
us a new look so it's something
different to work with it keeps things
more varied and less stagnant for the
b-roll on the channel and 2 it's never
going to use probably for a roll or very
rarely anyway which means that there's a
low chance of me filling the table with
stuff that gets in the video team's way
so to benefits there the downside is
this mural is in 8 pieces and it is 12
feet by 9 feet so it's gonna take a
while to put up and it's gonna go here
and and then we're gonna drill through
it later with shelves and stuff like
that so this looks awful
here you go Josh Josh and Andrew we'll
take it from here
so we made a lot of progress so far and
Andrew and I are now working on potting
a bunch of plants we have these
succulents that it can I get go into the
hexagons up there should be pretty sweet
we were just doing some test shots here
of some headphones and it's looking good
so far but we added this one and didn't
film this process anyway it's tall and
it gets in the shot and we'll be able to
take care of it so we're going with real
plants unlike some people in the tech
space which I mean basically all of them
with real plants yeah I don't know it's
I guess the theme is going to be like
wood tones and plants and right now we
just threw a blackout curtain on top of
the table not sure if we're gonna do
something else with this the plan is to
get these and to those we're gonna put
because they don't they don't have
drainage on the bottom but that should
still be fine because these are
succulent plants they don't need a lot
of water and I'm just gonna put some
foil in to protect the cheap wood that's
underneath put some rocks on top of that
soil plant them and then we have we've
started decorating this shelf it's not
final this is just this little change of
it the wallpaper actually came out
really well so if you're looking at it
like like if you're like this you can
start to see the pixels it's pretty damn
good from a distance and once you
account for things like potential bokeh
and depth of field on the camera
distance of the camera from the wall and
focus on a different subject it's pretty
convincing so we're happy with this
this went on relatively easily it's just
anchored into the drywall and yeah let's
I guess well we'll get the plants in and
see how it looks after that so what
we're doing right now is we're adding
some foil into the bottom just protects
against the water but there's not going
to much water in there hopefully this
will work out with tape and then we're
gonna put these two plants in there
first
so there is a mimicry plant and then a
the sedum back backfilm I don't know
so these say they are this one's a split
rocks native to Africa it has an egg
shape it basically looks like Bulbasaur
we also have this one which is from
Mexico so the hope is that these two
together shouldn't be too big they don't
grow that big past this point so they
they should have enough space in this
hexagon and I guess if I can find where
we got these I'll link in the
description or somebody's gonna do a
home improvement project or whatever
so this one came out looking pretty good
the ball the star one definitely seems
like it took a while the one on the
right is incredibly fragile and it was a
bit damaged from the store so we tried
pretty hard to prop it up and you did a
good job getting it straight with the
rocks and hopefully the one on the right
also survives but we'll see so this is
our new b-roll set we've done it we've I
think we're mostly gonna use this for
b-roll so pretty rare that you'll see me
over here when we do a video maybe I
don't know it's it's much more
interesting now like this corner
actually does something so yeah we've
got one of the these plants are like
some of the oldest ones we've had in the
office and then the new ones this one
planted really well pretty happy with
this one I am skeptical about the
survival rate of the succulents and
there's the hexagons but we we shall see
we did our best we did pretty good job
planting them it's just some were pretty
fragile so I think they'll be okay for
now at least and these things ended up
sucking so I thought thought it was a
lot bigger and maybe put something
useful in there but I don't know we'll
either get rid of them or fill them with
sand or something like that colored sand
maybe the last thing for us to do in the
space is figure out we're gonna fill in
a little bit more of the wall space with
some stuff so the plan is to finally get
some of the CPU are up here from the old
CPUs that you all sent to us we've
actually tested a lot of that old stuff
in content so it's been more functional
than we had planned but now it's time to
get some kind of I think maybe like a
logo made out of
views up there or something like that so
keep an eye out for that one so yeah
that's that's the b-roll set and I guess
we'll just do a montage reel of fancy
shots now because because that's why we
built it so enjoy some random product
shots from the new b-roll set
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
