binary either it's better to buy a D GPU
and a dirt-cheap CPU or it's actually a
decent deal there's zero room for middle
ground in a market that's targeting 150
to 180 dollar purchases
there's no wishy-washy Anna's here it's
just either it's good or you skip it
preceding our Raven Ridge at 2400 G
benchmarks we decided to test the G 45
60 and our 3 1200 with the best GPU
money can buy because it's it's it's
literally the only GP that money can buy
all the other ones are gone before
getting to that this video is sponsored

$5 shower shave starter set the kit
includes the Dollar Shave Club executive
razor bearing the haps of any
high-quality tool and also includes
reloadable cartridges the $5 kit
includes everything you see on the
screen now like the body wash and shave
butter and can be refilled for a few
dollars a month this deal is available

Nexus so we're using a GT 1030 with
those and a couple of the G 4560 that
lands at about a hundred and sixty
dollars which just so happens to be
about what the new risin ApS are priced
at and then with the r3 1200 we landed
$180 for both together which is about
$10 more than the 2400 G so it's a good
price point and lands between the two so
today we're only talking in gaming
performance this is not like power
analysis thermal analysis because
frankly at this price point the amount
of people who care in that is very low
when you're fighting over a couple of
watts difference trying to get a part
that's like combined under $200 it's
fair to say that the real thing here we
care about is the frame rate performance
and in our ap reviews we will do power
and thermals as always but for today
we're just going to set a baseline so
that 2400 G is coming in for testing
we'll have it within a couple of days of
this video going live and we're pre
testing this stuff to get you an idea of
where it falls because historically with
AMD APU is with the previous FX ones a
lot of them really ended up in a place
where you kind of get through the end of
testing and you look at it sit back
you're like
why wouldn't I just buy a cheap $80
graphics card and the lowest end but
still reasonable CPU I can get and
generally that was the better solution
now however and these gone to Rison and
Vega architectures these are two
gigantic differences and that philosophy
might not apply anymore so we'll have to
test the Raven Ridge ap use as they're
called and see what it boils down to
once those come in now another big thing
here to consider is the memory
compatibility and the needs of an APU
an APU is one of the few instances in
gaming computers where you will almost
always notice a difference from the
memory speed so almost always there's an
impact because what you're looking at is
a shared memory pool for the GPU and the
CPU which both exist on the same chip
and there's no dedicated memory for the
GPU except for what's sort of
dynamically assigned to it during
processing so you're also dealing with
DDR which has much different latency and
speed properties to GDD are or video
memory and that means that as we scale
down the frequency or loosen up the
timings the impact can be compounded
from what you would see with just a
straight CPU so we'll have more on all
that soon capacity comes into play as
well but for today what we're doing is
we're testing the G 45 60 with a kit of
memory at 2400 megahertz so we could run
it at 32 hundred megahertz with a
zseries board however if you're buying
the gene 45 to 60 you're probably not
buying a z-series board it kind of kills
the whole argument of it so we're
running with its maximum supported speed
on most low-end boards that's 2,400 and
then for the AMD r3 1200 we're
overclocking that because we can to 3.9
gigahertz pretty easy to achieve it
effectively becomes a 1300 X plus or
minus a bit at that point and it's not a
hard overclock to do we're also running
it with 29 33 megahertz memory again I
could put I could put a much higher
frequency Kida memory in there but we're
running it with a lower one because with
both these CPUs you're in a budget
market it doesn't make sense to buy 3200
megahertz
that's insane because Mary prices are
also insane so those are memory speeds
for all the details on testing as always
check the article link to the
description below if you have questions
about other parts or methods that were
used in testing and we'll talk about
more of this once the aps get in but for
today let's get started with a couple of
the eSports titles rocket League
overwatch so forth and then we'll get a
couple baseline titles in there with all
of our other CPU and GPU numbers in the
past just to establish where this thing
can land when coupled with either an r3
at about $100 or a G 4560 at about $80
starting with rocket League our goal was
60 FPS in the game as we figure these
eSports titles would do best with
lowered settings in exchange for higher
FPS seems like a good sacrifice we
configured the game the high settings
with world detail dropped down to
quality as they call it and the results
was a tie it's clear that we can achieve
60 FPS average and reasonable lows on
both configurations for $160 the G 45 60
and GT 1030 do exceptionally well here
we're holding 60 FPS somewhat easily
even with the cheaper memory and the our
three alternative fare is just as well
we're bottlenecks by the GPU more than
anything as made evident by the tied
numbers and the real test will be to see
how Andy's Raven Ridge 2,400 G performs
we have one of those again coming in
pretty soon so that's really what we're
setting up for for now we've set the
stage for what the apu has to beat and
these parts both CPUs and the GT 1030
are all readily available which means
you're not contending with the GPU
availability issues higher up in the
chain this is direct competition to the
apu with no real out available dota 2 is
next for this one we tested using high
quality settings and 1080p at 100%
resolution scaling which is what we
always use we saw more of the same here
performance was bad at 63 FPS average
but the GPU likely contributing to some
limitations here 0.1% low performance it
looks a bit better on the r3 1200 but we
are also within margin of error for all
intents and purposes these results are
functionally the same what is noteworthy
is that the GT 1030 and its low-end cpu
partners are fully capable of
relatively high quality dota 2 gaming at
160 dollars to $180 combined which is
not bad the Raven Ridge APU is the price
point challenger of this and again we'll
see how that does soon so subscribe to
make sure you catch that when we do
follow up counter-strike go is next for
csgo we tested with a mix of high medium
and very high details pursuant to
previous optimization tests we've done
for graphics versus performance in this
game configuration is in the article for
this one the G 45 60 and GC 1030 ranked
at about 111 fps to 120 FPS average with
it low is functionally equivalent
between the two configurations as
expected csgo is almost laughably easy
to run on any modern hardware
configuration even a 300 dollar gaming
box
overwatch provides another low load FPS
eSports title with medium settings we
appear to be bound again by the GPU both
CPU configurations ranked at roughly 60
1 to 64 FPS average with invariance for
this title and those are functionally
equivalent we're able to sustain about
medium settings on this PC build and not
bad overall for a non eSports title with
the higher quality graphics we can look
at Ghost Recon wildlands at 1080p and
low settings this puts into perspective
how much a GT 1030 will struggle with a
higher fidelity games we're at 38 FPS
average when running low quality
settings which subsequently looked
pretty bad actually you really wouldn't
want to play at this quality Ghost Recon
it very high is obviously going to be
completely unplayable on this
configuration but let's get a chart on
the screen anyway the point of this is
to demonstrate relative performance
scaling versus our standardized GP
review bench which does use a 7700 K
mind you and the GPUs listed the G 45 60
doesn't matter much here as the GT 1030
is choking the entire pipeline for
perspective of scaling we get about 68%
perforins uplift by stepping up to the
next worst configuration
total war Warhammer is one of the games
where we leverage to our existing data
pool just for some perspective although
not really that playable or enjoyable on
the low-end platforms we're testing
today benchmarking at 1080p high still
allows us to establish some relative
scaling versus
CPUs with our standardized 1080 TI test
GPU again all the other CPUs were tested
in our CPU reviews so we had a 1080i
with those with these low end platforms
we end up at about 21 FPS average for
the G 45 60 and the GT 1030 or about 30
FPS average for the R 3 1200 overclocked
the variant also using the GT 1030 this
establishes just how much vertical
Headroom there is four components if we
were to upgrade things but let's move on
to 1080p medium for a bit more realism
where we observe a GPU bottleneck at
about 36 FPS average with both CPUs
roughly equally constrained by the
$80.00 GPU there's not a lot of room for
growth here until we upgrade really both
the components although the GPU needs it
the most for one final relative
performance identifier times pi it shows
us that the overclocked are three 1200
performs significantly better in its
physics processing for this test leading
the G 45 60 by about 50% GPU scaling
shows us has roughly equal in both
configurations as you'd expect with the
rx for a 64 gigabyte card leading by
about 60% so this is where we get into
the smaller details ignoring the AP use
the reviews should be live when this
video goes live but we'll have ours soon
ignoring the AP is what you're looking
at is a situation where for a couple
extra dollars you can significantly
improve your performance by going to
something like well if they existed in
rx 560 or a GTX 1050 or something like
that but they're hard to find right now
and frankly not everyone can scrounge up
another twenty to forty dollars to
improve their PC build so the question
then can you actually play games
reasonably and be happy with something
like this and an 80 to 100 dollar CPU
and the answer is depend on the types of
games you want to play yes you can play
eSports titles you can play rocket
League
overwatch counter-strike dota anything
that's similar to those games you could
play just fine even to a lesser extent
Total War it'd be a bit of a push
through some of the battles but if you
lower the settings enough you can play
it it's not quite as enjoyable with
those lower settings but the eSports
titles optimized really well they're
naturally not that intensive and so yes
get away with playing those anything
higher end than that once you start
looking at GTA Ghost Recon things of
that nature anything with the high
fidelity graphics it is going to be a
problem and it is probably a waste of
money to buy something like this for one
of those games because you're gonna end
up in a year or less replacing it
because it'll just not be able to take
it anymore so it's gonna come down to
what kind of games you play and if the
answer is I play basically things that
look like counter-strike overwatch and
dota and not much more intense stuff
than that then yeah you're gonna get
shaped with these the next question of
course is should you buy an APU and for
that I'll tell you to subscribe and
check back within a couple days because
we'll have an answer for you very soon
hopefully on I think the 2400 G that we
have coming in that's the interesting
one from Andy to look at so that's it
for this one subscribe for more as
always you go to patreon.com/scishow
upset directly and of course that review
should have more thermal and power data
as well so you'll want to check back for
that go to store that gamers nice net to
pick up one of our shirts like this one
and I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
