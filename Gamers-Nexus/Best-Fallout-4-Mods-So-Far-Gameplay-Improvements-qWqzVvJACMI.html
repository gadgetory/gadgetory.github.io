love and hate that the industry had to
offer and for good reason it spent years
in development allowing all manner of
hype and hysteria to build up around its
November release and Bethesda's games
are never good enough for modders anyway
modders are almost like some sort of
arcane Council of ancient Guardians ever
present and the resolve to fix that
which is broken and to add to what is
missing and to do whatever this thing on
the screen is right now speeches aside
though fallouts already got some
impressive there I say essential mods
available and that's without the
official deck toolkit from Bethesda
today we've got to fly through of the
must-have mods for fallout 4 let's get
started on that first off armorsmith
extended vastly expands upon fallout 4s
armor system this mod adds new craftable
outfits allowing more armor and clothing
to be worn simultaneously and optimizes
slot usage for vanilla clothing every
outfit can now be worn under armor
pieces and for new clothing mods allow
for the creation of linings outfit
add-ons headgear add-ons gloves and
eyewear even
dogmeat gets a new assortment of armor
because an indestructible dog needed a
more armor for the player hats with hair
headgear gloves and even a functional
jetpack have been added to the game note
that you'll need another mod to make
this work though and that one's called
armor and weapon keywords community
resource and as with all the mods in
this video you can find download links
in the article links in the description
below Skyrim is 5 year tenure has
allowed a serious pool of modding talent
to accumulate and some of that is
pouring over into fallout 4 true storms
has been around since the Elder Scrolls
games making its triumphant return to
fallout 4 about rejuvenating Bethesda is
intentionally bland atmosphere and this
mod adds at weather with lightning
improved textures a new rain rendering
technique through ambient lighting rain
sounds with thunder and several night
brightness levels as an extra bonus
there are new interior sounds for all
weather types substantially improving
the
atmospheric immersion as for the types
of weather added you can expect fog rain
dust storms and misty rain each
featuring heavy and light variance true
storms wasteland edition is a major
overhaul on the game's realism and
variety and we strongly recommend it
fallout 4 settlements remind us of more
ones a Blood Moon expansion and its
Raven Rock quest one of the best
role-playing experiences I've ever
played through and city building is big
and limitless in creative options but
functionality is limited in so many ways
especially in Fallout 4 with its
settlements luckily however home maker
expanded settlements fixes this
especially for PC users and homemaker
ads more than 800 placeable objects for
player made settlements including cars
new door types working street lamps and
lights even and refrigerators
greenhouses and so much more for players
who don't feel like micromanaging a
built project prefab buildings have also
been integrated including lighthouses
radio towers and can now even be popped
down with a few clicks and it wouldn't
be a good settlement without a strong
defensive battery that's where new
fences barriers and gunner barricades
have been added by the home maker mod
with special categorization for easier
build management this next mod probably
has the longest and most functional name
but it's synergy with home maker is too
perfect to pass up increased settler
population with infinite settlement
budget yes that is the name does exactly
what the name says it removes the object
limitation for settlements meaning you
can fully utilize as 800 new objects for
true city construction granted a city
can't exist without settlers and that's
also fixed by this mod which effectively
removes the settler population limit we
all need more robots in our lives this
year's CES was all about smart homes but
we think fallouts got a better version
of the robot they're snarky a little
clumsy and terrifyingly hostile at times
but they're also limited and that's why
we need more mods robot home defense
feeds the automation addiction by
allowing all protection variants to be
crafted by the player then deployed on
settlement patrols or as personal
companions sentry BOTS assault Ron's
mister
dusties and since can be created ordered
around and assembled into an unstoppable
robot army just don't turn your back for
too long dialogue in Fallout 4 was a bit
of a shocker for the first time in the
game's history the player character got
an actual voice but the dialogue options
are often paraphrased and ambiguous to
fully expand those options and remove
the ambiguity of interactions the full
dialogue interface mod replaces
paraphrased responses with the full
lines spoken by the player game pads and
number keys can also be used to rapidly
select responses something that honestly
Bethesda should have done to begin with
that's a pretty big oversight but this
adds it in foreign language speakers
will also be relieved to know that the
mod also adds multiple translations for
that dialogue so if your foreign to the
native English in fallout this will help
resolve that we finally arrived at our
last mod vivid fallout landscapes which
improves fallout for somewhat
questionable launch graphics
significantly optimizing performance and
bolstering overall image fidelity the
mod allows for a lower resolution and
Ultra HD resolution textures ensuring
that pcs of nearly all hardware
configurations have some form of
recourse to play the game at its fullest
potential
we'd strongly recommend this mod as a
means to instantly improve graphics or
if you're on a potato computer improve
performance without too severe of a drop
in quality for mod install order and
