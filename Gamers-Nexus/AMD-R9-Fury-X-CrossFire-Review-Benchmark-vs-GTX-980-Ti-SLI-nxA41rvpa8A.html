Donna and today we're reviewing the r9
fury x the new AMD card they just
launched the fury non X version which is
an air cooled version of this card and
that's priced at about five hundred
sixty dollars and it's rumored to have
spurred and Vidya to drop the 980ti
price by 20 bucks to six hundred and
thirty dollars I haven't seen that take
hold yet and retail outlets but it is
supposed to be forthcoming so for the
fury X this is $650 it's a liquid-cooled
VG card so it uses the new fiji
architecture and perhaps more
importantly it's got HP m memory or
rather redundant high bandwidth memory
so it uses HP m rather than gddr5 and
this is a big step in the new direction
for GPUs this is something that Nvidia
will be doing in the future as well as
it drastically improves the memory
bandwidth available for the card to work
with so for this benchmark we look at
the frame rate performance as usual we
look at frame times and the average FPS
look at the thermals and also at power
in terms of what the power isn't looked
into as in-depth in this video as it is
in the full review so for full
information on the power draw the
thermals frame rate all of that hit the
link in the description below for the
feejee architecture drill down and the
fury x review but let's get started with
a overview of the new feature our
Kotetsu by AMD and see if this promised
return to form is actually able to
compete in today's modern market it's
been several years since a and these
released a new architecture they've been
on 28 nanometers since 2011 so this is
potentially a big deal for them and it's
important to really address all the
architectural and new memory bandwidth
increases and and all that sort of stuff
in the depth that it deserves
so andy's fiji architecture is brand-new
for the fury x it's featured on the fury
also and this is something that wasn't
shown on the new 300 series video cards
that we also reviewed those in fact were
refreshes of the previous architecture
they were more similar to Tonga in many
ways than Fiji
and they weren't true rebadged but their
refresh is in that
discussed in a previous video today
we're talking about Fiji it's still 28
nanometers and it's probably one of the
last 28 nanometer chips that will be
produced by AMD and II really can't go
any bigger than they already have the
GPU dye size is 596 millimeters squared
which is pretty darn big for a GPU and
to put that in perspective
Nvidia as a GM 200 max while chip is 601
millimeters squared so there's really
not a lot of room for growth here and
that limitation is imposed because of
lithography issues where the stepper
scanner systems that are used to create
and fabricate these dyes these silicon
wafers and dyes that are cut from them
are limited by the reticle which is
called the reticle limit we won't see
larger GPUs if at all we definitely
won't see them until after we move to a
smaller fab process for PG&amp;amp;E is sticking
with its GCN architecture that's
graphics core next it's been around for
quite a while now but they're using GCN
at one point to effectively it's not
really officially called that but that's
what it is
so fiji has a new version of GCN and
there are a few improvements to GCN 1.2
some of them come from the 300 series
that we already talked about those are
not on a new architecture but they did
make some improvements to GCN that were
carried over here and one of the main
ones that you'll hear about is called
delta color compression this is similar
to what we talked about with Maxwell
where the GTX 980 introduced what Nvidia
calls third-generation Delta color
compression and these doing something
similar here so the idea is that Delta
color compression looks at the frames
temporally meaning over time so you have
frame N and frame n plus 1 and in this
example on screen frame n is the one
you're seen now where you've got the
grid car and you see all the color is
just fine frame n plus 1 is the next one
because we're looking at a tempura Lee
and you see all of the pink sort of
pixels shaded in this helps indicate
where colors have changed and what this
is doing is telling the GPU hey these
colors have only changed so much within
the value we can just take the Delta of
the change rather than fetching and
redrawing based on an absolute value so
this process reduces the bandwidth
consumption of the memory by about 40
percent and the compression ratio here
is about 8 to 1 so you can see that the
tiles are compressed 8 to 1 similar to
the 300 series Fiji improves the power
efficiency of the fury X card so Andy
has made great efforts to reduce the
thermal and power envelope of their GPU
they've done this in a few ways for Fiji
the first main one is that APU
technologies have been sort of lifted
from a pea use and imported into Fiji
more or less so a couple of those would
include dynamic voltage which just means
that the voltage modulates itself and
regulates itself based upon load that
helps reduce thermals and it helps
reduce power drawn another item moved
from ApS to the GPU is the clock rate
and its ability to sort of fluctuate
dynamically as well so it modulates the
clock rate based upon load but of course
the most immediate thing on everyone's
mind is the CLC the closed-loop liquid
cooler this is manufactured by Cooler
Master I've got a great big whole page I
located to this thing and the articles
so sort of click on that and just read
that if you want to learn more but the
very short most important items of the
CLC are primarily that it helps in
reducing thermals which does a couple of
things for power as well
the main item here is that sticking of
CLC on the card will help reduce the
power leakage from transistors so as you
heat components up on a device like a
video card as you heat up the
transistors there's a much greater
chance of power leakage meaning energy
wasted a couple of other changes to the
thermal envelope include the way that
the shader array is handled so the
shader array will throttle when it's not
in demand and basically it's similar to
the core clock if the GPU detects that
the shader units are unloaded
it will modulate how much power is
assigned to those shader units and
effectively gate the power provided to
them the shift to HBM further grants
inherent power efficiency gains it's
definitely a noteworthy amount but we'll
have a full article and video on that in
the future that's too long to go into
here but HBM is the biggest
architectural shift in GPU computing in
quite some time
it is clear that this is the way the
industry is going in the future
including Nvidia the question of course
is does this actually matter right now
is it enough to achieve parity to match
the performance of the 980ti which is
the most immediate competitor some other
important architecture points before we
dive into the framerate performance here
Fiji's sim D uses a 64 asset wide
wavefront which provides really a
massive amount of plane potential for
pixel and vertex shaders so this is
something where Nvidia's warps which is
basically their name for a collection of
threads their warp is 32 assets wide
right now and this is part of why we see
Nvidia performing so well with gaming
they've really fine-tuned their
architecture to optimize for gaming
tasks and AMD does really very
impressively well with computes their
compute is higher than the competing
Nvidia device but they are a little more
versatile so they're not as specialized
in gaming and that's where we get this
performance disparity where Andy will
perform very well for OpenCL where
you've got complex data structures and
for Nvidia
it's just really driven for gaming so
that's that's where we see that
disparity so more on all of this in the
article we talked about whether the
feejee is Rob's pound or triangle bound
at different resolutions and things like
that
HBM is a future topic let's dive
straight into some of the benchmarks
here next we will talk about thermals
and gaming performance for discussion on
the power draw please see the article
link in the description below we have
two different thermal charts the thermal
chart here shows average thermals and
you can see that the 980ti hybrids at
about 20
2.91 Celsius the reference 980ti
on air from Nvidia's 61 Celsius and then
sapphires fairly impressive cooler for
the 300 series at 45 with a fury acts at
41 not very impressive for the the fury
x4 thermals it is much better than Andy
has been in the past so I will certainly
grant them that but for a liquid cooler
I think they could do a little bit
better even with the cooling of RAM and
VRM this next chart shows the thermals
over time and we only have the 980ti and
the fury acts on here so what you're
looking at in the light blue is the r9
fury X you can see that it takes longer
to sort of reach equilibrium and when it
does reach equilibrium which is about 16
minutes or so into the the chart here
you see that it's still warmer than the
980ti hybrid but much cooler than the
980ti reference so AMD is in a zone
where we don't feel like we're thermally
compromising our system by sticking
their GPU into it whereas the 290x which
was running at 95 Celsius in many cases
began to be a bit of a concern because
that warms up everything around it so
this is a it is a step in the right
direction and that is a good thing so
this is where things get a little bit
interesting we did much more statistical
analysis on our game benchmarks than we
normally do and that's all in the
article if you're curious for this video
we're only going to recap a few of the
games will very briefly recap The
Witcher 3
far cry 4 grid Autosport and shadow of
Mordor and if you want the rest it's in
the article The Witcher 3 illustrates
the fury X is pretty confusing results
very well what you're looking at right
now is the 4k result and we're sitting
at 56 for the average FPS with really a
quite dismal 1% low and 0.1% low and as
we move down into lower resolutions you
will see that the performance gap the
Delta between the 980ti
and the fury X actually widens so for
the fury accident crossfire the 4k
performance is 56 fps worth pretty bad
1% 11.1
percent these single Fury axes at 31 FPS
average with the 980ti 35 FPS average so
980 is in the lead we go down to 1440
and the gap widens now we go from 50 FPS
on the fury X to 58 on the 980ti
so our performance disparity has has
grown quite a bit in fact it has nearly
doubled it's gone from a 12% gap at 4k
to a 24% gap at 1080p so why is that
happening well this becomes a question
of whether the fury X is limited by its
ROPS its raster operation units or if it
is limited because of geometry and from
some analysis it is my understanding
that the fury X is limited by its
geometry performance this is something
we know Andy is not particularly good at
tessellation they're not really
particularly good at complex geometric
elements and games they're great at
shaders and that's sort of anything else
they fall short so that's what's
happening here and we're getting
throttled by geometry performance this
is shown further in grid Autosport in
grid you'll see that interestingly the
performance actually becomes somewhat
capped so at 4k the highest performing
AMD device is the crossfire fury X
configuration at 108 fps I should first
note that grid often exhibits some sort
of abnormal framerate performance versus
other games so this is one thing to note
when you're looking at the chart at 1440
notice how the whole chart has shifted
in favor of Nvidia and where does the
fury X crossfire sits it sits at almost
exactly the same fps as in the 4k chart
so what's going on here look at 1080 now
we're hitting CPU limitations or
something else in the system because the
my ATI is heightened X 90 I hybrid all
of them are effectively the same fps
across the board so we're hitting some
other bottleneck in the system why then
is the fury X not also at the
limitation at the 128th range it's still
Cydia now 109 this is really quite
confusing we saw this in some other
games as well in the article you'll see
those but at the end of the day it's
some sort of limitation in the pipeline
that is not present on the Nvidia cards
far cry 4 exhibits similar behavior to
The Witcher 3 where we see the 980ti
reference performing marginally behind
the fury acts at 4k and the sli and
crossfire configurations sort of tying
in their average performance that I need
T is Li winds out barely and 1% low
performance but it's basically tied with
if he reacts in crossfire when we drop
to 1440 you see that the 980ti reference
card jumps ahead by 15%
so again we see a limitation in the
pipeline probably some sort of geometry
or something like that now we're looking
at shadow of mordor at 4k and as with
many of the other games in the charts we
see the 980ti hybrid which is a non
reference card meaning it's more similar
to what you would buy in the market from
one of the manufacturers because it's
overclocked to 11 140 mega Hertz from
the thousand megahertz base and that's
basically every card on the market will
be about that so that's our performing
the fury acts by quite a bit really it's
50 verses 42 fps and moving to 1440 and
1080 you will once again see that the
fury X loses its gap in terms of Delta
between performance with the Nvidia
devices GTA was interesting because we
were able to exceed the 4 gigabyte hpm
limitation on the fury X but check the
article for information on that for
their analysis let's very briefly look
at overclocking here you're looking at
the overclocking results table for the
fury X and the next two will be the
980ti hybrid and 980ti respectively for
the fury X we were only able to increase
the clock rate by 60 megahertz to a
maximum clock of 1110 megahertz it's a
pretty small jump and the memory offset
was 60 megahertz for a total of 560
megahertz and this was validated with
GPU Z with a 264 and as bench
so it was so it was applied to the cards
this is about a 5% overclock the r9 300
series we were able to get about an 8%
overclock neither of these are
particularly impressive the 980ti we got
in excess of a 20 to 30% overclock on
average and that's that's pretty massive
it has actually a very big impact on
performance as you'll see in these
overclock benchmark charts meanwhile the
fury X C is almost zero gain it's really
in my opinion not even worth
overclocking I don't know if I am the
plans to release voltage tuning
utilities for the pure ax but as it
stands now there's really no point to
overclocking the feejee card
it just doesn't produce any noteworthy
FPS gains so concluding for the fury X
this has been a pretty difficult card to
review because it's all new architecture
it's dot HBM which is brand new to any
video card really that's in the consumer
world and Andy has made the right steps
for improving their performance and
achieving hopefully parity with NVIDIA
they've got a very powerful architecture
that has huge compute performance it's
got a massive shader array and those are
good things for Andy it's certainly much
better in terms of power efficiency over
the 290x so the the fury X for power
efficiency is only about 26 watts more
than the 980ti and yeah it's still more
but at this point it's not forcing you
to buy a higher wattage power supply so
that is a step in the right direction
for sure and the thermal performance
could use tuning I think that the tubing
on the CLC is probably a bit of a
concern for installation but overall
thermal performance is greatly improved
over the 290 X as well and other
previous flagship so Andy is moving the
right way they hear the criticism and
they're responding to it unfortunately
there are a few problems here in terms
of performance for gamers so the main
one is Andy still suffers from poor
frame times in a lot of games
shadow of Mordor is a very good example
if you look at those charts the 18 FPS
1% and 0.1% lows are pretty bad and
those are the numbers that impact
fluidity of the experience so when
you're playing a game and you see a
sudden spike
is from the 1% and 0.1% metrics where
average FPS really is sort of irrelevant
to that point because your gameplay has
been interrupted
so Andy still falls short there this
could theoretically be resolved with
drivers because PG and HB m are both
very powerful items and the 4 gigabyte
limitation of memory isn't really
prevalent in any games we've tested
except for GTA 5 at maximum settings and
at that point it's producing unplayable
frame rates anyway on all the cards and
these drivers support has been pretty
disappointing they've only released one
wickel certified driver since December
and that was the one for the launch of
this video card so they've had a couple
of beta is the GTA beta driver and
witcher 3 beta driver come to mind but
they're certainly behind on the driver
and software optimization front and
that's a big problem for andy especially
they want to compete with and video
which is really pretty prolific in terms
of game industry support and
optimization so andy struggling with the
framerate output on games where it
should in theory from raw hardware be
able to produce a much better framerate
and given their track record for drivers
i'm not sure whether we're gonna see the
steps taken that andy needs to do and
until that point in time the 980ti is
just it's a better buy right now in
terms of performance in terms of frame
times and if the rumored price drop is
true then that's certainly a factor as
well at overclocks much better so you
get even more performance and if the
price or performance disparity closes
between the 980ti and the fury x then
it's possible though the fury x will
become a good buy because it is a
promising card but it needs to be lower
in price or higher in performance so
that's not where it is right now I would
be buying the 9d DTI at the $650 price
point range I haven't looked at the fury
non axe the air-cooled one that's much
cheaper I from initial benchmarks would
believe that that's actually a pretty
competitive card with a 980 not
necessarily the 980 TI so that's where
we stand on this check the article for
the full analysis it's 5,000 words or
something and has a lot of charts that
you don't see here in this video and I
will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
