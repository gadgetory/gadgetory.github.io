nexus dotnet and this is your weekly
game news recap fallout 4 came out on
tuesday and just before that black ops 3
released on friday which was after our
previous news recap was filmed so these
two games effectively dominated the news
and media cycle for the last week or so
and to bring everyone up to speed on
sales figures and other interesting
financial metrics fallout 4 shipped 12
million units in its first day which
Bethesda called a tremendous success and
it broke records on steam for concurrent
players that's players simultaneously
online and playing fallout 4 with a new
record of four hundred and seventy
thousand active players simultaneously
for Fallout 4 the game also generated
750 million dollars in revenue
physically and digitally in its first 24
hours and for comparison black ops 3
which just released on friday was a 550
million dollar revenue generator in its
first 72 hours that's the full weekend
effectively and black ops 3 based on a
previous title success is expected to
surpass 1 billion dollars in revenue by
the end of the year which is another
massive financial success for Activision
if that were to happen looking towards
other shooters battlefield 4 which is a
bit dated these days got an update from
an even more dated game but one of my
favorite FPS games of all time
battlefield 2 so battlefield 4 will be
getting the dragon Valley map in its
legacy operations dlc this is slated for
release later this year and dragon
Valley will be available for free
download to owners of battlefield 4 and
this I best remember the music loading
into dragon Valley but there are a lot
of things to remember it's sort of a
narrow map with a lot of vertical space
for aerobatics and fighting and jets and
things like that expanding on this the
dice developers are looking toward
battlefield 4 to expand that vertical
element and hope to add
more distance between the bounding box
and the cloud layer in the game so that
pilots can battle it out in a sort of
more private setting where they won't
really be seen as well by the players
and that creates kind of a bigger feel a
more volume as voluminous feel to the
map this is free to PC later this year
alongside the legacy operations DLC
moving into a completely different genre
we look to roller coaster tycoon world
which has been delayed into early 2016
that's a quote from Atari early 2016 we
don't know exactly when if it's quarter
one or two and that was announced
following its first beta weekend there's
one more beta weekend planned for our
ctw but following the first one the
primary issues of concern that came up
to Atari and the developers were
primarily pertaining to the poor
information convenience regarding
coaster simulation the track layout and
track editor was a little bit hard to
use and players by and large requested
that individual track components which
are prefabs be added to the track editor
so that they can more easily build and
edit tracks and then even more over that
understand why they fail where they fail
things of that nature this is now I
think they're on maybe the third set of
developers it's it's been a couple
developers now on rollercoaster tycoon
world and Ataris been pushing it for a
while but overall things are moving
forward with the current group in a
visio and the only really major issues
that I've read about that we've looked
into over the beta weekend would be
memory leaks and optimization problems
that were present in the first beta but
this is all supposed to be resolved
according to Atari by the 2016 launch
legacy of the void also came out and
starcraft 2 is sort of old news at this
point i know everyone jokes dead game in
the face of the MOBA blitz that has
taken over the what's left of the
strategy space in terms of gaming but
blizzard plans to launch a new series
following legacy of the void so this is
not
end of the starcraft series and
certainly not the end of the starcraft 2
build in its current iteration Blizzard
plans to release the series called Nova
covert ops which are missions that
expand the game's single-player and
maybe more we're not sure yet but
definitely single player as first
release is planned for spring 2016 this
was announced at blizzcon which just
happened so that is all for this game
