announced its new Radeon Pro SSG
solution which is a solid-state graphics
solution they're calling it and this
host memory starting at one terabyte in
capacity it's not the typical on card
vram though it's a little bit different
SSG as we understand it right now is
effectively an extra pool it's an
extended frame buffer where the card
when it taps out of its onboard memory
it can tap into via PCIe bus this SSG
memory which basically allows AMD to
bypass the process of talking to the cpu
to request information from system ram
and if it's not there you go to the
storage device hard drive solid-state
drive or other so instead of going
through that path and these able to take
all this extra data in data storage data
sets that might need for production
applications put it onto an SSG they're
calling it and a pull from the PCIe bus
which is much faster and physically
closer than system RAM that matters to
so this is not a gaming device this is
the production devices for workstations
and as such the price starts at a ten
thousand dollar fee for the development
kit and that kit will begin availability
in 2017 you can buy it now I don't know
that anyone in our audience does that
sort of thing but it's certainly worth
talking about because interesting
technology other than sort of the basic
specs that we have right now we do know
from a presentation that Andy held
tonight at SIGGRAPH that the live
scrubbing time of a video improved from
17 fps to about 90 plus fps so that's
somewhere around a 5x
increase in performance just under 5 X
and that for anyone who does video
production or other workload tasks is
pretty significant because you're moving
from 17 frames per second which is below
what the user will see even if you're
outputting a 24 FPS movie which isn't
that common anymore you're moving from
17 fps
to something that's pretty similar or
exceeds what the user will be seen so
that's certainly useful for quickly
editing applying effects
manipulating the models things like that
Radeon SSG is also being targeted for VR
content creation and they said oil and
gas exploration that's certainly not an
industry we pay attention to CFD or
computational fluid dynamics and other
computer and or computational
engineering applications and then
there's some scientific applications in
the world of medicine and medical
research which we also don't follow so
that's how it basically works from what
we know right now I don't have a lot of
other hard specs we have the price again
10 grand available 2017
in the mean time and that's for the dev
kit by the way in the mean time and the
also announced its new Radeon Pro WX
series so these would be the effective
competitors to Quadro if you're not
familiar with the WX line but you know
the Quadra line they compete in the same
market space the three new cards
announced today include the WX 7100 the
WX with u-100 the WX 4100 GPUs all three
are on Polaris architecture I'm not sure
right now if that's Polaris 10 or if
there's a new version of the GPU but
they are on Polaris we know that much so
it is the 14 nanometer FinFET process
node that we saw with the RX 480 and
these cards are built to drive the new
GPU open standard or the expanding GPU
open standard I should say which
includes some of and these new ish
technologies like fire rays and things
like that for real-time ray tracing and
getting more out of the light tracing
and renders the WX 7100 the high-end
card is targeted at media production and
VR content creation the WX 5100 is sort
of mid-range as the name might suggest
and that goes for product development
and in this world product development
means things like designing your car a
BMW I believe uses game engines or at
least some of the companies use game
engines now I think BMW is one of them
to do their automotive rendering and you
would use a card like a WX or a Quadro
card to do that with some level of of
speed and then the WX 4100 is an HHH L
format or have
height half length so that's built for
small form-factor pcs so you can put
your HHH L video card in your SFF box if
you like acronyms that's the way to do
it and that card is targeted at
supporting pro CAD applications or
computer aided design or drafting and is
targeted again at small workstations so
that's those three W X cards I don't
have phone numbers respects on any of
these I don't know the architecture
beyond it's Polaris and that's all we
have for today for those who are out of
loop on the workstation world I would
the once I do know that covers it with a
more consumer slant which certainly our
site is would be Rob Williams site tech
gage he has some decent reviews of
Quadra cards and fire pro and things
like that you can go check his reviews
out we don't look into that stuff but
that is the technology that's the
interesting stuff the SSS the SSG rather
solution the Radeon Pro one terabyte
memory array or whatever you want to
call it is pretty interesting I'll be
looking into that more I've asked AMD a
few questions about it hopefully we can
learn at it about it just from a
technology standpoint and see how it
works if we can ever expect something
maybe lower end to come to consumer but
for now it's all workstation so as
always patrons emotional video gonna
help us out directly thank you for
watching subscribe for more content I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
