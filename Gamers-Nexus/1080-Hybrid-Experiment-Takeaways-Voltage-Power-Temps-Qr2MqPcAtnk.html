GN hybrid project well first of all to
recap there's a three-part series it was
really fun to do and we want to do more
of these in the future so before we get
into the details if you have ideas for
the next one post them below we'll look
at it and see what we can do after we
get back from computex and Asia so this
three-part series first I took apart the
1080 second I built up the hybrid
version of the 1080i ripping the hybrid
cooler EVGA ASA tag liquid cooler off of
a 980 I hybrid put it on the 1080 third
part we tested it and showed performance
results and described sort of what the
advantage and loss were in different
areas of the card so what we learned
primarily about the 1080 that's
important is one thermals were in fact a
throttle point and we're an issue that
needed to be result so these thermal
issues basically whenever hit 80 to see
the car would clock down hard and then
jump back up pretty immediately once it
hit 81 see again of course then it hits
80 to see again drops down jumps up
drops down jumps up repeats this process
and so you end up with a chart that's
all crazy like that for the frequency
which you don't want and that reflects
very poorly in the games that we tested
with for example in dirt rally you end
up with insane judder or artifacting or
something and eventually the screen will
just go black now here's the thing any
folks who tested this card and
overclocked it but did not do the
endurance test that we did would not
have seen that their overclocked what
was in fact unstable so this instability
only appears in endurance tests from our
card we obviously have one sample so
sample size a small but from our card
the instability only appears when
working over a somewhat dragged out
period of time like 10 minutes plus and
and in this those cases the thermals
will throttle the frequency and do it
pretty severely so these overclocks you
see online depending on what they're
doing in their bench depending on their
thermal settings maybe they have there
been to one hundred percent speed and
I'll talk about that in a moment but
either way you do end up with some
instability if the thermals are a
problem now with the fan of the hundred
percent speed this is where it's
different if you set the vrm
to 100% speed yes it does mitigate a lot
of these issues so for benchmarking
purposes reviewers almost certainly have
had their fans one hundred percent I
would trust most of them to do that and
we certainly did it in our initial tests
but as a user that's useless because the
noise is about 57 to 60 decibels at one
hundred percent that is as loud as
conversational speech I'm probably
talking about about 65 decibels right
now but the that's just it's not
tolerable for a normal use case scenario
in a room even with headphones on you
would be able to hear that down the hall
and down the stairs basically so that's
not a good scenario you need some better
way to cool it we decided liquid made a
whole lot of sense if you want to keep
this thing running at a high overclock
without the voltage throttling or with i
should say without the thermal
throttling but to that Miss speak that I
just did voltage throttling is the next
big problem so thermals were a small
issue they contributed a little bit and
resolving those thermals gave us an
extra 100 megahertz or so overclock
stable so it was a good overclock it was
a good game and it was a worthwhile
project for many reasons the second
issue I really wish we could have
overclocked more but we could not and
that is because after looking at it
further the V bios or the video card
vios is limited in such a way that it's
trying of course to protect the user
from applying too much voltage this is a
thing that Nvidia AMD you have both done
in the past and both presently do and so
they limit the voltage control in such a
fashion that you cannot destroy your own
car they were cover ibly so that is the
next limitation but it is controlled
very strictly and I think there's room
for play there but i'm not positive the
vrm looks like a 5 plus 1 phase design
not particularly powerful for extreme
overclocks kind of middle of the road
for the next one hundred dollars
certainly but that's what we got for the
vrm i still think the voltage can be
pushed a little higher but it can't be
done without hacking v bio somehow or
without doing power mods on the card
which speaking frankly i have not done
i'm not sure not sure how that would
work out so that would certainly be
another test we could try and sacrifice
our card to the video card gods or
something
the voltage power mods from what I've
seen and read and talked to with
manufacturers some of the manufacturers
have been speaking to us about this and
basically said they think it might be
possible to get more voltage out of this
thing v bios as a limiter but also the
vrm if you just for example power modded
and added an extra six pen or eight pin
header to that card from what
manufacturers have told us it looks like
the reference board would not handle
that and the vrm would blow so i'm going
to trust their judgment on that and not
do it myself but i would expect the AIB
partners to release their own custom
boards that are capable of handling that
extra power header which would allow
more overclocking Headroom if they
unlock v bios and i don't know sometimes
the AIB partners aren't allowed to do
that so it may be a case where folks
like us who want to push this harder
turn to forums and look for hacks from
the more serious overclockers people
like kingpin certainly would be doing
this almost immediately so that's that's
what we learned with the limits first
it's thermals for stability after you
get past stability from thermals either
because you found a ib card and you've
got a better cooler or because you put
liquid on it you're running a hundred
percent vrm fan whatever once you get
that past that point the next limit is
the voltage control it cannot go that
high i think we're capping at 1062
millivolts and maybe i've seen it go up
to the one point oh eight or ten eighty
millivolts but that was very short-lived
and didn't seem to last so that's pretty
hard limit there on the voltage and
that's with using EVGA precision the
sanctioned tool to do the over voltage
that's the next limit third limit will
of course be the power connectors
themselves but that's pretty good ways
out i think voltage is the biggest limit
we were not hitting a hundred percent
TDP or i should say one hundred twenty
percent TDP since we increased it by
twenty percent through the power percent
target in EVGA precision we were not
hitting that power draw with the
overclock i think with the overclock we
were drawing about three i didn't record
this officially but between 299 and 31
8 watts for the overclocked version and
that was total system load that's not
individual video card power draw total
system load was 300 ish and then the
stock card without liquid without over
clock was running about 270 watts and
that's in our power draw chart so it
increased an extra 30 watts certainly
drawing more power that would put us at
about 200 to 10 watts there's some more
power left in that header because the
PCIe slot also provides 75 watts on its
own and depending on what kind of power
supply and what kind of Hetar you have
there might be more power in there to be
had some people will say sort of a hard
number they'll provide a hard number in
comments or on forums for what power
headers are capable of providing that is
not always true it depends on your power
supply on the header on the particular
cable for that power supply and of
course on what's going on on the video
card side where it may be limiting
powered intake for its own safety
reasons so those are all factors to
consider it's not always just a hard
limit based on the cable basically eight
pen is not always the same power draw it
depends on a couple of things the
fluctuation is not that great the range
is pretty tight so the range for power
draw out of an 8-pin from a power supply
is certainly limited but it's not fixed
to the same value for every single
device that's all I'm trying to convey
here so that would cap the limits of the
1080 that's what we've learned from our
liquid cooling mod thermals certainly an
issue not the big issue v bios is the
big issue and then you're next if you
resolve the bios your next thing to look
at would be the actual wattage provided
to the card and some of these things
like cooling and the wattage provision
are coverable under the aib partners
that's something they can do with custom
PCBs those custom PCBs I can tell you
now will not be signed for six hundred
dollars at the low end of this MSRP
that's not something I've been told by
them that's something that I know will
be fact at least immediately just
because it's expensive to make so I
would expect to 650 to 700 dollar price
range for something that's reasonably
overclockable the founders edition again
as I said in the review it is a good
card it
warm as well I would not buy it I would
buy an a IV partner version because the
thermals will be better the noise levels
will be better and your stability for
overclocks with a lower fan speed will
be better even if it's not liquid just
having to push fans on there I e twin
frozr acx wind for source tricks any one
of those would probably do a better
almost certainly do a better job than
the blower fan there are configurations
you want a blower fan we're not going to
go into those here but it's mostly SLI
so that's the whole project if you have
ideas for the next project post them in
the comments below we will start
exploring these multi-part series
because they're pretty fun to do and you
can all tell me how I need to get an i
fix it sponsorship again so thank you
for watching patreon like a postural
video I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
