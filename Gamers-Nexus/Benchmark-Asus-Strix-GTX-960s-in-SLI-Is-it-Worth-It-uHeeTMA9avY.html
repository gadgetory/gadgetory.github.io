Nexus dotnet and today we are talking
about SLI GTX 960 s I tested two of asus
strix gtx 960 cards in sli to see if the
performance gain was actually noticeable
and if it is is the value good when
compared against Nvidia's other
offerings the GTX 970 or 980 or AMD's r9
290x and similar cards so a few things
out of the way we are using the asus
strix gtx 960 which is the very same
card that we reviewed in our gtx 960
review but we've got two of them as a
quick recap the Strix has a bolstered
core clock and boost clock it's got a
bit faster memory clocked by 190
megahertz and all the stats are
published in the article linked in the
description below if you are curious
about the specifications so it is a bit
faster than the reference gtx 960 it's
also quieter and it spins down the fans
when less than 30 watt load is is placed
on the card so if you're playing League
of Legends or dota it will spin down the
fan so that is the card we are using
this video card is 210 dollars so if you
buy two of them that puts you at just
over $420 and then you've got other
options nearby like the GTX 970 which
has 4 gigabytes of video RAM a bit
larger than this frame buffer probably
set around 350 so it's cheaper got a
larger frame buffer and a wider bus and
then you've got obviously the GTX 980 if
you were to spend about $100 more than
the SLI configuration significantly more
powerful you're buying an AMD there's a
292 90 X price range of about 300 to 400
dollars these days and then things like
the 285 are nearby as well so those are
the configurations we're looking at when
it comes to the value of SLI GTX 960 s
and to sort of recap some of the
concerns with SLI that we've had in the
past years generally there is a lack of
support in video games for SLI
configurations that has been trending
for the better in the last 2 years or so
and this does include crossfire at this
point when I say SLI I do mean both
crossfire and SLI games have not
supported multi-gpu configurations very
well they're finally starting to do that
and as Nvidia and Andy both push for
this support we are seeing games
increase their frame rates and actually
playability with SLI configurations part
of the incompatibility has triggered
what's known as micro stuttering there's
also tearing and framedrops and all
sorts of issues that can stem from
incompatibility with SLI or crossfire
and those things mean that you have to
disable one of your cards immediately
cutting your investment down to half of
the original investment so you're not
even using one of your cards at this
point which makes it very difficult to
justify SLI so we're testing in this
benchmark to see if that is still the
case with modern games and triple-a
titles other than these concerns we have
concerns on the Department of the GTX
960 s memory bandwidth and memory
interface it is not quite as wide in
terms of bit as its GTX 970 counterpart
which is cheaper than two 960 s in SLI
all cards were tested using the latest
Nvidia drivers as of the posting of this
video and the latest and the Omega
catalyst driver as you can see the GTX
980 is king of the Metro last light
bench with the 290x following shortly
behind by AMD the 970 is a bit behind
both of those but above the 960 SLI
configuration so already we're seeing
the 400 plus dollar SLI configuration
falling short to a $350 single card
option and then the 780 is behind that
the 780 these days if you're not aware
can be obtained for about $300 making a
very high value but it under performs
compared to even SLI 960 so we start to
see the the cards age
moving on to grid Autosports benchmark
the GTX 960 s in SLI pushed about a
hundred FPS which is within margin of
error of the GTX 970 s performance so
these are effectively identical and the
780 and 980 both have performed these
cards some of these discrepancies will
be due to the games software side
optimization and what the developers
have worked with when optimizing the
game so do keep that in mind but even
still the 960 s in SLI are not great
value when compared to even end videos
other offerings and the value is still
sort of questionable when compared to a
and
is 290 X or 290 offerings moving to Far
Cry 4 we can see the GTX 980 tears away
from everyone else with the 960 is
following behind an sli so here's an
instance where we don't have the GTX 970
on the bench because it was not
available unfortunately for our Far Cry
4 testing so we don't really have a
great idea of where that falls it's
somewhere between the 780 and 980 but
even still the GTX 960 is in sli
performed pretty well in Far Cry and
begin to be more justifiable in this
instance unfortunately this is the only
instance thus far where they have been
more easily justified so it's not that
versatile of a configuration as you can
see by this test now we did other tests
using battlefield 4 where we saw
substantial improvement between the
single 960 and sli 960 s but still not
great value we also tested with
firestrike which is a 3d mark tool
synthetic benchmark showing a massive
lead for the GTX 980 against pretty much
everything else and the SLI 960 s were
very close to the 290x the only place
were the GTX 960 s and sli really broke
away from everyone else was in the 3d
mark firestrike graphics and physics
framerate testing these are independent
tests of physics versus graphics
rendering and the 960 s in sli in this
instance outperformed even the 980 this
is sort of where we see issues with
synthetic testing and as soon as we did
a combined test of both the physics and
the graphics for the 960 s they fell
short massively from everyone else so
this is an issue stemming from the
memory bandwidth and memory interface
limits that are imposed on the GTX 960
it does it great with 1080p gaming that
isn't very intensive from both the
physics and graphics side simultaneously
but as soon as you introduce both of
those elements we see this shortcoming
in the 960 finally I decided to do a
higher resolution test than 1080 because
I was curious to see if the memory
bandwidth an interface would bottleneck
the 960 to the point where it is not
worth buying a second one in our high
resolution tests almost every game was
very playable
the 28 96 by 1629 resolution and this
remains true even at the 1% low dips
where they stayed above 30fps so the
dips were less noticeable the only break
to this rule is far cry 4 which had a
lot of frame drop issues in SLI at a
higher resolution which is probably
again pointing toward limitations of the
bus the memory bus on this GPU now we
also tested using an assassin's creed
unity and there's no chart for this
because there were no results for this
Assassin's Creed unity is so poorly
optimized for SLI and this is a really
more of a fault of Ubisoft although
Nvidia worked closely with them so it's
it's on both parties ac you had severe
stuttering issues the textures were
flickering and tearing as we played the
game turning black things like that
there were massive frame drops and lags
where we would have upwards of a second
of frozen screen time in Assassin's
Creed unity so that showcases the
general concern with SLI and crossfire
and that these concerns are still alive
and well even with the extra push from
all the GPU manufacturers and game
companies to improve SLI and crossfire
compatibility so the ultimate question
is an SLI configuration with GTX 960 is
worth it really the answer is no with
one contingency the value is poor when
compared against even Nvidia's other
offerings and especially a.m. these
offerings and nearby price points and
this is largely due to memory interface
limitations it's largely due to the fact
that the 960 is meant to be a single
card solution for 1080p gaming to begin
with so it wasn't really built for SLI
even though it is compatible with SLI
but the one contingency is a very
specific use case if you were to buy a
single 960 today and you wanted to buy a
second one in about a year to improve
your performance then I could see it
being justifiable at this point if
you're looking to spend $400 you are
much better off buying a single card
solution from either AMD or Nvidia and
if you're thinking well I'll buy a 960
today and then maybe in two or three
years I'll buy a second one don't get
your hopes
up on that because every time we've ever
looked into that option it stops
existing because the cards cease
production limiting you to use devices
and very expensive devices because the
demand is higher and the supply is
almost non-existent so that makes it a
wiser choice to buy a single card to
replace your single 960 and a couple
years than it does to do SLI and a
couple years of that 960 so that is all
