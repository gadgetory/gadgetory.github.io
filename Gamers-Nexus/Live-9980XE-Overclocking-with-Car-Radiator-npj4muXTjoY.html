live now
I think we're live now never quite sure
let me know if you can see and hear
everything okay and we are we're pretty
fun stream I'm not gonna reveal the
system just yet but it's it's
interesting it's it's cool okay chat
chats there okay so can everyone hear
this I'm getting some yeses cool what
cpu it's the I $9.99 ATX II gonna change
them to that it's not the 70d XE
actually it is except that has solder
this time so yeah that's what we're
working on today getting people saying
that that you can hear so what we're
doing is we have how I'm gonna let some
people join chat but we have a 99 ATX e
and someone's asking car radiator or
what a cool Maura I'll talk about that
in a moment once I show it so 90 90 DXE
if you don't know is a 79 80 XE except
it's soldered and otherwise completely
the same so it's it might you bend a bit
better I don't know it's more mature
silicon in theory so my clock a bit
higher but the difference here is that
it's a different CPU insofar as not
being literally the exact same unit as
our 79 t ed Exe which is good because
maybe the silicon quality is higher on
our 1990 DX e the problem I ran into
previously was that the when we did the
review was that the 99th EDX II was just
getting too hot for me to overclock at a
size or 792 d XE so if we fix that
problem then how high does it
overclocked at that point that's the
question we're looking at today and I
would like to try and beat our 79 t DX
ee times by extreme physics core that's
my goal today and if it beats it without
I don't know if we'll beat it with
without
water I think so what I even get see
3dmark Hall of Fame so last time I did
this was before dual GPU we got to get
back in there and do that again but the
cpu score previously 12,000 428 I don't
know maybe a lot of that wasn't memory
last time a lot of we're not gonna be
playing on with GPUs today so that makes
a lot easier I can just focus on the CPU
I would like to be 12,000 for 28 that
was our previous high score for the 70d
XE at mixed o'clock so it was like 5.0
or 5.1 on a couple cores and then 4.8 or
4.9 on the rafts something like that
maybe 50 on the rest that was with
chilled water though and if if the
silicon quality is higher maybe we can
beat that with not chilled water and
then that would make things easier if I
want to put it under dry ice later and
BJ's current score so that's that's kind
of we're doing some quality testing
today on the 1980 XE so it looks like
chats filling it a bit see if there's a
couple super chats and things like that
you may need a bus radiator who's a big
radiator
okay so we got Eric s $2 funds for
flying builds to the office thank you
Eric
we've talked about it not this year as a
not before end of year but we have
talked about the option Paula Knox two
dollars Australian what cpu are you
using
collapsing emojis or something I don't
know what that is in between each each
word it's a 99 8 exe which is a 70 90
DXE I've not deleted it and when I was
talking to Rome and their bauer about
the thermal issues we had on the night 8
exe we kind of discussed steal it and I
just told them I'm not gonna bother like
I just it wasn't interesting enough and
I knew the risk would be alright I have
like I said to them in Skype I'm worried
I'm gonna rip the SMDs off the substrate
because it's not like a 9900 k where
there's no SMD is there no surface mount
devices it's just a flat substrate and
the only thing on there's a die so
worst-case scenario is you might damage
the die but if you're confident that
won't happen you're fine and the 1980 XE
surrounded by a bunch of small
components so I told him I'm not
deleting because our 9900 K had some
like solder overflow around the edge of
the die that was just enough where if it
had been a ninety nine eighty xee
there'd be zero clearance between a cap
and and he deleted his and we all know
how that worked so he's gonna repair it
at some point though so I am not deleted
here it's just solder and the bonus of
intel solder on the ninety nine eight
exe is that once I bring it to something
like dry ice it will be easier to work
with I mean it's it should perform
better than probably then 790 dxu a
thermal place because once you're
sub-zero you really can't use liquid
metal anymore liquid metal is the hotter
it gets the better its thermal
conductivity so as you drag it below
zero Celsius you need to switch to paste
at some point and solder should
theoretically be better than most pastes
so we'll see but I'm not doing sub
animate today or sub-zero today anyway
John keep up the great work five
daughters thank you are you going to
test the Z 390 Maximus 11 extreme no
current plans I think I've seen some
interest for that one so we might talk
to Asus about it but no current plans
okay so I just checked a normal chat and
I saw infinity XTX Haig please give me a
shout out all the way from the UK I'll
give you a shout out but I'm not gonna
go to the UK to do it so infinity X DX
well welcome to chat let's um we're at
about 1500 viewers now it's starting to
build so let's let's show off the system
here's the thing when I reviewed the 99
ad XE we said their statement was that
as long as the concern was can you get
it to a high overclock without the
lighting without needing an unreasonable
cooling solution so our stance was yeah
you could probably get it to a really
high overclock like kingpins been doing
with dry ice or liquid nitrogen as he's
been doing with Alan - and it might be
higher than 790 DX e but can you get it
higher than 270 DX e without liquid
nitrogen can you get the 980 XE to a
pretty high overclock with a reasonable
cooling solution that any user
could fit in their case for example and
so what we've done today is we are
trying to answer that question we have a
reasonable cooling solution that anybody
could fit in their case assuming you
remove all other components from the
case and that is the more of three 420
millimeter radiator it's got four 200
millimeter fans on the front it is
basically the car radiator and I don't
know if water cool sources any other
parts from from car radiator
manufacturers but I would be kind of
surprised if they haven't done it in the
past if not currently so hi this is this
is this is the Mora 3 with a whole lot
of fans on it well large fans on it
anyway a technically chat but yes yeah
yeah it is reasonable it is reasonable
what he's talking about so this is from
water cool I've met them a few times
ransom in Germany and they've been
trying to expand their us market
presence and I asked them well I don't
know anything about your product but
please send some along and we'll will
try and work with it and see if we can
start understanding what you all sell
and this was one of the first things
they sent um so yeah it is a it's got
for 200 fans on it the thing with those
fans though is that it is technically we
get higher pressure through the radiator
with 140 s or 120 s but these are
different and interesting and they're
quieter so that's pretty cool and then
the someone's asking about new case door
and asking if you could get this into a
it's a it's a computer radiator he
clickbait at us I mean if you think this
is only ever used in computers then yes
I guess so but I guarantee you this is
used in things like the radiator core is
used in things other than computers for
sure there's no way there's not volume
on this to only be computers are these
similar things out of the factory would
be but anyway yeah so we have four knock
to 140 s on the back they're not special
I didn't have I don't have another
bracket for 200 millimeter fans in the
front so
Patrick installed four knock to one 40s
in the back one of them is the 3000rpm
industrial fan but I've brought down the
speed to about 1,400 to match the others
so not actually that fast which would be
cool because if we can get these
temperatures down without blast in 2500
rpm fans that means everyone will have a
better stream experience what else
should I appreciate your lack of RGB in
those fans we appreciated it too and
that's why we gave nacht whit an award
at Computex for the least amount of RGB
stuff at a booth the phrasing was a
little different but so yeah I don't
know what else to walk through with this
I guess we'll do the basics so I have
the full system components list in the
description below
if you're interested in any of them and
we're using four of the 200 millimeter
fans we've tested these before versus
other 200 bands these are pretty good
but then I wouldn't describe them as
overclocking fans I mean this is not
this is not an optimal setup it's it's
this is what we would call a reasonable
setup that anybody could have in their
case so it's not the highest
overclocking performer but for those for
the other Noctua fans the the radiators
on a stands it's a more of 420 it's on a
stand which is kind of cool
very heavy especially one filled with
water and also has quite the slicing
potential as I learned when I was
assembling it the pump is a dual DDC
pump this from ek we still have our wood
block over here so dual DDC ek pump with
a tall reservoir on it and then that is
hooked into I've actually changed the
CPU block so it's no longer the ek
supremacy we've changed it to the heat
killer or what they call is it for heat
killer for from water cool and
unfortunately we're not gonna have an
easy way to show you the system itself
because there's a gigantic wall of
radiator in front of it so that's not
going to have the effect I want
I'll just be careful when I walk near
this yeah it's a really really fun
system to set up and we're gonna see if
at overclocks okay the biggest biggest
challenge is just thermals on the cpu
and this should solve a lot of those I
think we'll just leave this there that's
I honest I don't know if that's more or
less secure but I'll just not touch it
about that so yeah reservoir pump
radiator CPU that's the loop the GPU is
just an FCW 3 RT X 28 see I f TW 3 I say
just because I don't have it under
liquid I don't have it under ice
anything like that so we're not gonna
get as high as total score but we should
get a higher maybe CPU score than
previously I hope like I said the but I
don't know the really high goal would be
twelve thousand four hundred points but
I don't know if we're gonna hit that
without without ice okay so is the
stream stream quality stream playback
quality okay that's the question I think
I think it is based on comments just
checking that before we really get going
and I need to pause the playback here
okay so a couple super chats before I
dive into this we have Derek $2 hash tag
shirtless stream no John five Tyler's
keep up the great work
are you going to test the I got yours
the Maximus extreme not sure Brian
Johnson five dollars went from 6:00 to
midnight when the stream started you get
it thank you and you're welcome
went from 6:00 to midnight when the
stream started okay okay Kevin began ski
five dollars what shampoo do you use to
get your lawn locks and is your hair
naturally wavy I use their own paste
we've gone over this everyone should
know this by now so typically you know a
bit of cryo knot and then he followed up
with some arctic silver
yes the other answer Martin Berta's
which hi Joel hi Steve stay warm this
winter vscp is I think we can accomplish
that I think I think this will warm up
quite nicely with the CPU going calm or
Derek Derek Jackson five dollars no
message thank you evil bread two dollars
you checked your power company before
overclocking I think they'll they have
nothing to complain about they're
getting money for it Sean Devine $5 rip
Jays four radiators is this thing
superior than Jays at :
I don't know I mean it's not superior to
dry ice that's for damn sure but we'll
see I've never used this radiator before
it should be a lot of fun though okay so
what do we what size fan does that
radiator take we've got four to hundreds
on the front of it so if you want to
find a box fan the size of those I guess
you could do it and then we have four
140 s on the back so we haven't even
fully populated the back but anyway yeah
I think we can start overclocking this
it's a quick note as our way it's one of
the best ways to support our streams is
through the GN merge story and go to
store that gains access net it's a big
stuff up there I say it one of the best
ways because other than super chats of
course we have we have a lot of stuff
and we would like we would like to keep
that stuff moving so if you want to get
something in exchange for helping us you
can go to the store and pick something
up the mod mats will be in first half of
December so if you're in the US there's
a very strong chance you'll get yours
barring any shipping issues before
Christmas and then international is kind
of hit and miss email us if you really
concerned about it but the mod mats are
going to be in very soon they're almost
out of production we actually got we
have a video to share of how the mats
are produced I haven't even showed
Andrew yet so we have a cool video on
that but you can pick one up very high
popular item keeps selling out and we
order them in waves the next way will be
here soon otherwise the GN cobalt-blue
beer glasses are in and
you can pick those up on the store as
well with discounts for multiple units
okay so let's just save that these are
all the old profiles from the previous
stream so let's save that as test and
then let's blast this profile away and
start over so restore defaults except
for fans we need those going fans num
lock please 100 100 and let's do a tea
on the vrm fan that's the one that's on
top of the BRM heat sink that evj
includes on there dark mother EVGA x-29
a dark motherboard we've got a link to
that below if you're interested let's
turn to XMP on and then I think I might
just leave it there and see what happens
so let's turn XMP off for that I guess
just do complete stock except for the
fans so let's see what that does just to
get us a baseline so that we can really
appreciate the the progression of
overclocking tonight okay so a quick
note advertiser for the stream is
Corsair and they have the SF 600 which
is genuinely one of these smallest power
supplies we've had here in the office
might be might be the smallest solar
stones a close competitor but the
Corsair SF 600 let me point that over
that way one of the smallest if not the
smallest modular really small power
supply we have a link below if you're
interested good for things like small
form-factor pcs mini ITX build we have
extremely limited space and it is
modular so if you want to get rid of the
cables for mini ITX build so that they
don't unnecessarily clutter the very
limited space you already have then
that's a good option for you and they
also have these in 400 or 450 watt units
so they've got lower wattage just two
that are a bit cheaper if you don't need
quite as much juice for like an APU
build or something
of course there's work pretty hard on
the small form-factor power supplies
this year okay so 3dmark we're gonna do
a time spa extreme run dry run only only
a fan speeds blasted I'm also using the
amusing Corsair link not because they're
an advertiser or even because I like it
because it's it's not the best soft
but because it is working alongside
their commander pro many I think it's
called
which we are using because there are so
many fans on that thing and it's so far
away from the bench that they just
genuinely can't reach the motherboard
and they still have trouble reaching the
controller because it's it's really tall
the radiator that is so that it's I
think we've got five we have five fans
connected to that and then we have two
fans connected to the motherboard it
looks like and the Nok to a black pete
3000rpm fan is set to a lower pwm signal
of Silas something like 80% something
like that okay
what's Chad saying should have gotten an
f-150 radiator I think well we'll cut it
here this one seems pretty good and we
might play around with like I said I
would love to dunk this radiator in ice
like we did with the the previous the
540 milliliter ek1 before going to dry
ice just because this seems like a lot
of fun to put in the ice bucket so we
might try that we might do another
stream with dry ice or wet ice
overclocking designed by Johnny guru yes
John guru works that works at coarser
these days he doesn't run the site
anymore that is I think the guys
username is Oklahoma wolf runs the site
now okay well we see Christmas rate
raise him this time no the Christmas
rate race well I don't know I haven't
used this card before maybe the the red
and green ray tracing by what you mean
artifacting that we saw was in the
stream with all the dye in 28 ET eyes
and we just filmed the first the core
segment of that video I have to finish
once we get off the stream here so that
will go out very soon we finally
finished working on all the dead 2082
eyes and died on 28 ET eyes and have an
update for you you can check out the
video later for that probably tomorrow
something like that so make sure you
subscribed if you're not so you can
catch that one because that's where I
walk through a lot of thermal data and
firmware updates
I tested with Linux a lot of you
requested Linux testing last time so we
did that just to see if it artifacts it
in Linux and I guess I won't spoil that
result
because that would eliminate Windows as
the potential point of concern which
would absolve Nvidia but it's I mean
yeah that's unlikely 8080 not eight
thousand eight hundred nine that's our
baseline score here so let me just kind
of drag this over there so eight
thousand eight hundred nine CPU score
for a very baseline so complete Auto now
our goal tonight is about twelve
thousand four hundred I don't think
we're gonna hit it but I'm gonna try
really hard without ice so Otto is 809
without XMP II and that's it
okay so that's our first run what I want
to see is what kind of temperatures do
we have during a baseline run so that we
can compare this later to see how much
we're heating up during the throughout
the night testing with higher
frequencies and voltages okay cool so
voltages properly set down to low like
one right now one point one something
like that or under actually where's our
temperatures okay that's just open up
core core five is typically very hot on
this specific CPU open that up and we're
just gonna get a baseline for everything
here x y is a really short test
fortunately so that does benefit us
because it doesn't need to get quite as
doesn't need quite as much assistance
between runs to cool down okay some
super chats we got APN films $2.00 thank
you my 20 atti FCW 3 it has some pretty
loud coil wine yes I mean that's every
20 atti has a lot of coil wine well not
everyone but a lot of them its want to
say every I don't mean every single 28
yeah I mean every single like revision
of the 20 atti they all have some kind
of coil line doesn't matter which one it
is it's a matter of his Fe so that is
just a commonality with this this
product yes $2 our I don't know I wish
YouTube would tell us the exact currency
my CPU is still faster dagi
- I I don't know okay well that's not
who that's in response to you but cool
Michael Hudson 499 evj Z 390 FTW a
motherboard opinion would you pair that
with an 87 hundred K overclocked an EVGA
XE ultra gaming 2080 TI you really like
EVGA sub i my opinion is I kind of want
to wait and see what the Z 390 dark does
because the Z 390 dark is actually will
catch this temperature before panning
back c3 90s are should be the flagship I
don't know what it's gonna cost that
might already be out there so my opinion
is I want to see what happens to that
one okay so just for our baseline here
the score doesn't matter just windowed
we're at let's the maximum temperature
this is not by the way how you should
ever measure temperatures by looking at
Matt yishun you should log it an average
it but anyway we care about Max's for
purposes of overclocking competitively
so our max is like 40-ish and I think I
think that is a bit higher than I would
like it to be so we'll see how far that
allows us to go we're already at 40
ambiences maybe like 20 something okay
we got a couple more super chats Sam
commands I roll it to dollars hey is
that a 79 80 XE yes and no it is is
Schroedinger CPU until you pull the
cooler off you don't know which one it
is is both the 99 a d XC and 79 ad XE
simultaneously the mage $5 Steve I
purchased - two - mod Matt's could I run
them in SLI and if so how well do they
scale up they scale linearly they will
take they'll take two times the amount
of space if you have two of them and
will you'll have to buy a AGN mod my SLI
bridge with it you don't have those yet
I'm sure they'll be sure they'll be
difficult to get and very expensive and
just like Nvidia's okay so well what's
going on I was just hitting delete or
something plus that's what I was hitting
plus okay so let's do XMP already where
we want for the fans per core I'll
message the memory last let's just put
40 come on man no mock please
46 that's C 45 let's see a 45
so 4.5 gigahertz is actually know what
what was I have numbers for 44 and I
have numbers for 44 at 1.15 so we can do
a pretty good comparison there no other
change is not going to mess with then
wow we should we should do that let's
put that 1.95 for VIN not gonna mess
with anything else here so let's let's
do that see what happens okay
do they support J tracing nothing chase
to sense version of ray tracing so like
I said picking stuff up from the store
tonight is one of the best ways to
support our streams the mod mats will be
in very shortly if you want one before
end of year you should place an order
soon because the next round will
probably be in January maybe end of
January something like that and then we
also have the beer glasses and the mugs
if you're a glass or a person we've got
15 ounce mugs for coffee drinkers out
there with the same teardown logo as you
see on this GN pint glass with the gold
rim and all that stuff so you can pick
those up on the store and we got an
order in already from Nate and Rock
Rapids picked up a mod Matt Thank You
Nate for picking that up
much appreciated okay so let's let's
launch this again and then wash off the
we'll have to show off the system again
for people who just joined a bit ago
maybe once this is running
okay so CPU only I click out back in
otherwise it'll break and yep there it
goes that's what times pi does okay
so our original baseline score our goal
is about twelve thousand four hundred
not sure it's achievable our baseline is
eighty eight hundred and nine and we
pushed up to a very smaller overclocked
4.4 gigahertz one point did I type in
1.15 remember what I typed in and on a
second
just before we commit that I don't
remember exactly what I typed in 3d mark
kill okay this was talking through
everything but not actually thinking
about what I was saying 1.15 okay cool
and that's before any loading but good
enough should be pretty flat LLC on this
okay
just do it quick let's do a thermal and
frequency a thermal and voltage check
first it's gonna run this windowed CPU
test and then I'm just gonna check on
Hardware in for a while that's going
hard wooden photo 64 by the way some of
the best software you can get for your
PC it's free I've never talked to the
developers but I would like to because
their software is extremely good ok
someone said the Gallo has asked about
the motherboard not an EVGA fanboy it
looks like good motherboard
yeah the z3 90 FTW is fine if you're not
running at stock it's even better it's
when its stock it doesn't really follow
the Intel spec that closely because the
turbo durations are extended if you
don't care about that and I don't really
have any major problems with it we might
be looking at that board I don't know we
might do a PCB analysis on that one okay
so voltage is one point one four nine
this by the way is an EVGA board so else
he's pretty flat on the X 299 dark which
is what we want for this application and
we are at 4.4 gigahertz so we're at
where the frequency was set and max
temperatures are getting in the 50 is
now so it's it's starting to climb we
should do a current clamp test too so
I'll set that up while I show off the
test bench please say a free software
hardware info is free software to use
anyway not to me but okay so we're okay
for thermals definitely you're in the
50s let's let's look at this bench again
I'm gonna hook up that current clamp if
I can get in there without knocking
anything over and
it's very close call at the radiator or
theof erm fan forty millimeter fan would
not survive contact with anything very
well okay alright good there I need
somewhere to put this without it falling
over that's gonna be a challenge you
know one second I got a got a maneuver
without breaking the vrm fan don't know
if it's possible I can just hold it
while we to her run for the whole stream
kind of Oh got it okay if it falls it's
gonna kill that vrm fan all right I'll
walk you through the system one one
second
we just need to start another one of
these first so I can look at the power
consumption while this is going to zero
it I don't think it'll be off by about
0.4 amps so they forgot to zero it okay
why don't you have the original car fan
on it you probably couldn't fit a car
radiator fan there almost certainly so
we got a store purchased from Tim in
Tracy in California thank you Tim for
buying the signed mod mat I'll be
driving over to sign those as soon as
they come in the ones that that were
picked up during the stream and
otherwise so if you go on the store
there are two skis for the mod mat one
is the signed one I have to drive out to
the distributor and go through all that
as soon as they come in but thank you
for picking that up Tim helps
significantly during the stream let's
check out the current draw here I can't
quite see it 23 amps so 23 amps plus or
minus about 0.4 because I did not zero
it before I connected it
it's about 276 watts give or take a
couple watts and has that changed at all
and it's part of the bench no 22.6 so
there's your power consumption with a
4.4 gigahertz one point one five volts
overclock if you can call that one then
here's the test bench just to walk you
through it people just joining
it's a Mora for 20 millimeter radiator
with four 200 fans 200 meter fans on it
on the front and then on the back we
have this is good placement because it's
stopping me from walking too close then
on the back we have four 140 millimeter
fans Noctua also and one of them is the
3000 rpm fan I just spun it down a bit
and I don't think there's a reasonable
way for us to show the rest of the bench
but it has an r/t x1 atti FTW three it's
got a 99 ATX e for the CPU we have a
heat killer 4 block
water cool on the on the cpu VRMs are
just cooled by air and a heatsink
nothing special and i think that about
covers it Corsair a X 1600 I for the
power supply and Andrews going handheld
so if the stream drops we'll be back
momentarily but let's make sure that
doesn't happen
okay I think you're good so that's the
rest of the bench and you know it would
be a good shot as if you dropped it
right on the middle and then it could be
it could be replayed for each right we
can do it Kyle didn't make a shirt out
of it so yeah extra night and dark the
heat color blocks pretty nice I haven't
used one of those before
RTX card I haven't tested it or anything
extensively but it's doing just fine for
this so that's what we're working with
all right
so what we need is no hardware info
running what was our our temperature
ranges in the 50s low 50s for that run
let's just run a full CPU pass what CPU
block it is heat killer for water cool
is the brand what's up with SFX PSU that
was the advertisement for this tree and
went through it already but if you're
interested in it there's a link in the
description below ok got a store pick up
from Joseph in Florida Thank You Joseph
picked up a mod mat as well very like I
said that's that's uh we're really proud
of that product of the mod mat because
it's completely custom like it was our
design
it's our spec we had to go find the the
way to get it made and we've had to do
all of the troubleshooting we had to
even figuring out how to ship it because
we have a video where we tested the $400
like pneumatic stapler versus tape
because shipping a six pound total
shipping container in a tube yes is kind
of a challenge so it was very fun to
work on the product it really gave me
some insight as to what manufacturers
deal with when we're criticizing their
products now I understand better like
shipping delays manufacturing
limitations working with factory is
stuff like there's really good
perspective for us so what we are
running right now is just four point
four gigahertz and 1.15 volts and you
take a note for that of that for later
four point four G 1.15 and I'm running
this because I knew we had a baseline
number for it in our review for
performance and for thermal data and all
that stuff so if you wanted to compare
you can check the review for some of
that we're in about the 50s right now
it's only maybe a 1-minute benchmark
something like that so it doesn't really
have time to soak into a radiator the
size of this one it's that there's a lot
of mass there and it would take a while
to reach steady state so being a shorter
benchmark is beneficial to us and for
this score we ended up at ten thousand
one forty two so our goal tonight
about twelve thousand four hundred and
with Auto with complete auto no changes
we had eighty eight oh nine so where
that number is right there we're at
eighty eight oh nine and then four four
point four G we are at ten 142
so we're approaching the goal but it
gets it gets increasingly more difficult
as we continue to climb and we are going
to have to for sure do some mesh
overclocking today as well that's gonna
be a big jump for us so let's let's go
ahead and get that into BIOS and then
I'm going to read some of the super
chats okay so quite a few of these to
check out right now Kevin why is five
dollars I take it Intel will not release
a new chipset for the new nine series X
processors my understanding is no I
think they're gonna stick on X 299 I
know some motherboard makers are working
on a new X 299 board for these CPUs and
the same CPU is for the most part but
there will be new boards so if you want
something that's maybe a bit more tunes
than perhaps they'd be worth looking at
but we don't have any yet so I'm not
sure I've seen one seen one of the new X
299 boards and it was an improvement
over the the vendors previous board but
we can't talk about it yet I had a V X
offset on that needs to be turned off
that's bad so we were actually not not
legitimately at 4.4 because I think
there is some AVX going on in time spy
let's try that with a B X offset off
because that is a bad thing that we
don't want
okay what video card is it it is in 2080
TI FTW 3 but we're not really using it
right now and the output display it's a
bit of an insult to it so okay this may
take a while this right no not as long
as you think to get at least to 11 okay
we've got a store order from Samuel in
Australia and he picked up a a mug and
the oh the shirt I've got on this design
the teal logo anniversary shirt Thank
You Samuel for picking that up it's got
a long journey but we will get it
shipped immediately okay so we just need
to see if that offset affected anything
this for at all in any meaningful way
and it is certainly possible
okay run that okay super chats we had a
message from Mitchell rule five dollars
do you think you'll be able to push the
980 XC up to the Pentium 4 extreme
edition temperatures I think I think we
can do it but maybe not under this
cooler I don't know we've got a lot of
thermal Headroom here tonight speaking
seriously to that one for a second so
we're good up until the 90s really you
start having some some D rating and some
fall-off of stability as you increase
the temperature voltage can't go as high
as we increase the temperature which is
what in turn increases temperature so
yeah I mean we're gonna push up until
I'm out of thermal Headroom and then
that'll be it that'll be the end of the
overclock because I guarantee the CPU
can go higher than what we're gonna get
tonight it's just we'll need more and
potentially dry ice or something like
that so just if you're curious the
current is still at dead of a 1 amp
higher it's like twenty four twenty four
point five so that could be variants but
potentially there's some impact from a
VX there okay we got a message from evil
bread there's one of the best names two
dollars what merged you need to sell the
most right now I honestly just look
through it and see if there's anything
that you genuinely like because anything
we have in stock where
obviously happy to fulfill the orders
immediately and then anything else
that's on backorder we get those out as
soon as they come in the the Raglan
hoodies I'll note we just restocked
those so if you've been waiting I know
some people were emailing me asking when
we get them back in the 2-tone
lightweight hoodies are back in stock so
if you're dealing with some kind of
cooler fall weather or something like
that then those are on the store and
they are a great item for not too cold
and not too hot
kind of like the Seabees current stance
but that's not gonna last very long so
previous with this exact setup except
AVX offset was on I'm just kind of
making sure that wasn't a factor here
and that was 142 yeah oh yeah so 10,000
for 12 so let's just update that note
this was with a vx-3 offset and we're at
10 for 12 outside of error a bit so now
we can let's just keep pushing frequency
incrementally until we get to a point
where it kind of gets stuck and
everything crease the voltage and then
mesh mesh will matter a lot tonight so
I'll start pushing mesh 2 also helps a
bit in the graphics so the graphics
benchmarking is interesting because if
you're a GPU bound which we're not here
but in the other two parts of x y
extreme it would be the faster if you
get like 2 threads to be a bit faster
than the rest if that's kind of your
maximum Headroom on the CPU it is
beneficial because the GPU is waiting on
the CPU a lot of the time keep up like
in dual and env length benchmarks or
something
so getting the sleep the the two main
threads a bit faster is always very
helpful for some more graphics core
actually not even just CPU score but it
helps with graphics work
extreme voltage mode enabled sure
whatever
so then 1.95 we're just gonna leave this
isn't gonna be stable I'm pretty sure
one point one five four target voltage
Emma was certain that's not stable auto
for the rest for now and you know four
point five is not really enough let's
just go to four point six maybe and see
I think we're gonna need like one point
two five for this but I'm gonna try one
point two four and see even get away
with it but I'm almost positive we need
one point two five yeah it's five
dollars can you please say it's
extremely important yaps CPU is still
faster dagi okay now I understand more
you're responding to someone and you're
you're having a proxy war with them via
me which I'm okay with because he gave
me five hours for if I don't know what
that I don't know if that's Russian I
don't know what currency that is they
just put the letter R next to it thank
you though and congratulations on your
CPU being faster than Aggies it's how to
light of discontent five dollars
Australian in fire suppression systems
they have dry water be cool to use that
and leave the fans on and see what the
performance is like for cooling please
test no immediate plans that is an
interesting point
this doesn't otherwise what I don't even
I don't know anything about what what
you're talking about I don't know
anything about fire suppression systems
is that used for like someone in check
let me know what is that used for like
electrical fires or something that would
make sense to me I guess
grease fires
okay let's launch that see how that does
let's chat saying
waiting on way down the stream to catch
up to where we are five-hour pogchamp 5
roblox one point forty volts no it
shouldn't be one point four two should
be one point two four
did I say one point four two or did I
type it
let's see see what it is
it's 1.24 it's not 1.42 if I said 1.42
that I meant to say 1.24 okay just
checking before we committed to that run
because that would have been not good
all right this time is gonna do the
trick it does yep run custom okay what's
mesh overclocked so you're familiar with
encore overclocking it's like that
speeds up a bit of everything I think
that what is the stock setting like 24 X
or something I think it might be a 2.4
gigahertz stock for mesh but we are at
we're at 24 right now I think I pushed
the 33 or 34 X ratio on the southern ID
xee when it was under ice I want to say
33 was pretty stable maybe 34 and you'll
see everything boost a bit so mesh is
one of the most overlooked things you
can overclock but it's on the x9 so like
X 299 CPUs you don't need to look for it
in like an ad 86 kaor anything like that
on core overclocking
doesn't it to make more sense to monitor
thermals on an external machine well no
it doesn't matter because we're not
we're not in a scenario where it's
really relevant you could put a
thermocouple in there and sandwich it
between the die and the the seat the IHS
and the cooler or something but there's
really just no point I mean we can we're
just we're just checking every now and
then I don't unless we're doing the we
were doing like the ice overclocking
then it becomes more important to do
external monitoring which we did we had
thermocouples going into the reservoirs
on the tank and all that stuff if you're
doing Alan to you for sure want one in
the L onto pot to make sure you know
what what temperature that's at because
that's really important for booting it
snow cold bug or stuff like that okay so
what does that pass
we are at four point six ten thousand
eight sixteen I said I thought this
would crash but it did not so that's
good four point six one point two four
and that is at ten thousand eight
sixteen in our goal tonight is about
twelve thousand four hundred so take a
note of that score and let's go ahead
and look at some of the to get a quick
thermal read so I understand where we're
sitting for a head room so we're just
gonna set this up so I can take a look
at a head room after just one pass which
is not gonna be that hot but important
to know okay and we got some super chats
in some store order stuff like that so
we got C store order from Nikolas in
North Carolina I picked up a an
autographed Maud mat that you nuclear
stores will get to get to you a bit
faster than the others given the proxxon
the distance we have Jason in Texas
picked up ATO logo shirt as well that's
this one the teal logo anniversary shirt
and then one more to read off Caleb in
Arizona I picked up a mod mat as well
thank you Caleb
and everyone else who's picking stuff up
during the stream so far always helpful
I'm trying to keep an eye on both the
like normal chat and super chat so if
I'm behind on superjet just give me a
bit of time I always get to all of them
sometimes we run a little behind because
I try to interact with with everyone
with normal chat too we don't want to
pay wallet if I can avoid it but it
doesn't mean we run a bit behind
sometimes okay what questions we have we
know salducci five dollars is that
radiator for the 99 over to go is that
radiator for the 99 a DXE or for the new
in quotes RX 590 uh-huh it's for its
it's for whatever you want it to be for
I haven't test the test of the five 90s
thermals in a serious way yet so we need
to get around to doing that but I pushed
that one off for review because we got
it like 24 hours before we would have
had to film a review and I'd rather put
higher quality content that has had time
in the lab
we can test it properly then just rush
it out especially cuz we already we're
dealing with a ninety nine eighty XE
launch this week but we'll review it
soon and look at the thermals so where
was our temperatures we're in like the
our worst was 58 61 60s so it's fair to
say we're about sixty now I'll leave
that up for a second
and we've got plenty of headroom here
though okay so let's get into BIOS and
if you haven't seen the machine we're on
a gigantic radiator with four 200
millimeter fans on the front out of
interest I see a silicon wafer in the
background what CB dyes are they we're
actually not sure and neither was the
person who sold it to me I bought it on
eBay and postal carrier unfortunately
Wow I don't know it's not really their
fault
the person who shipped it put it in an
envelope the postal carrier bent the
envelope like there was a crease down
the middle of it and so it's all
shattered up in the top but we decided
to frame it anyway not sure what what it
came from honestly don't know it looks
cool though
so that was at 46 let's just see can we
get 47 with this voltage that's that
would be nice
47 X on 1.24 let's just go ahead and put
mesh up a bit oh no I want to not change
mesh stand alone so we can see what kind
of impact there is do that separately
zbg says andrew is d - man your I think
it means your demand
well PS you are using the power of this
rig it is a corsair ii x 1600 i it's an
expensive power supply so it has an
option to go multi rail or single rail
we disabled we went to single rail
because otherwise you just constantly
trip all over the overcurrent protection
so we disabled that because we will be
going over we go in over 40 amps at some
point most likely so this is just 47
might crash here but I want to get a
current clamp read during this run so
I'll take a look at that if it's still
on
no carefully extract this actually I'll
just turn it on where it is which means
it's gonna be about 0.4 amps off for
accuracy would be a little inaccurate
but close enough and we we needed real
numbers I can zero it out okay so it's
back on I'll get that number in a second
what cpu is that it's the 99 ATX II we
got a I don't know what currency this is
sorry
we got a 1000 are you be super chat from
Lala hahaha thank you for the super chat
here's a handful of money buy some gas
for your car vais fais set up it needs
energy for stable overclocking PSA from
russia there you go you have a good the
great content well thank you
wah-wah-wah-wah for the 1000
Russian rubles thank you donation and we
buy some gas for the car radiator setup
it's probably about what we'll need
because we were approaching 30 amps now
so it's not that much and we do like 40
I think I was doing about 40 43 and some
of the blender benchmarks with a heavy
AVX loads but 30 is nothing - yeah it's
it's not a small amount of power I think
we're at 28
specifically 27 28 something in there so
roughly 330 watts in that range plus or
minus 0.4 amps rupees or rubles thank
you okay couple super chats juice drove
my screen went black
give me a second they'll come back
screen noise does this or it's a cable I
don't know so this is at 4.7 1.24 I
thought it would crash but it has not
just Rove stop Steve 15 Norwegian thank
you just as you can see this is what is
up right now anyway I think we are
previously at 10000 where we 10000 still
816 and now we are at 10,000 990 that's
a reasonable improvement so there's some
variance in this benchmark and it is I
mean sometimes it's a lot of variance
let's do another run same settings I
want to get two or three of these in and
then just change mesh only I don't know
if that'll really impact much until we
push higher start changing memory and
stuff but let's do that anyway they
talked $4.99 thanks for all the long
hours you folks put in to benefit us all
what is your favorite CBO temperature
track in Salzburg so I really card we're
in 564 that's on there right now we're
using that earlier
it reads pretty much everything it reads
even the special sensor is on some of
the Asus boards so really good software
you don't have to pay for it and I don't
know if they even have a paid version
I'm sure they have some kind of
enterprise services but we like that one
I bought and still use 8o 64 bought that
years ago first one I ever used it does
a lot of cool things but
for thermals it's not it's not my
favorite anymore it used to be I just I
find hardware info 64 to be more
accurate now because every now and then
over the past years I know there'd be a
new CPU and it just wouldn't see it or
it would read the temperature as
obviously wrong like every now I need
see a CPU at negative 30 degrees when
it's on air so we moved away from that
but I think they've gotten better I just
haven't revisited it
Axios to GBP what do you think of the
low r-tx fps in battlefield 5 no current
thoughts we're looking at it right now
haven't done enough with it to have any
opinion at this time although I'm not
surprised I guess Trevor Giuliani $5
please start a downhill mountain bike
channel on the side can we rely on GM to
have early reviews of his e 390 dark
motherboard for the sauce waiting on our
ninth gen I hope we have the Z 390 dark
early Jacob if you're watching get on
that I guess because I want to look at
that board we ate we technically I do
have a side channel the GN Steve side
channel and we I do have I keep saying
we but that one is just it's just me
this and who doesn't follow me with a
camera down the mountain that one is a
it's GM Steve I have a couple videos up
there for mountain biking some downhill
runs I have a night ride I need to put
up from Bryce bike park ok CB score 11
thousand six so as you can see some
variants demonstrated here Brett ten
thousand nine ninety before nothing has
changed I eleven thousand six second run
is often a little bit faster but we just
average those later if I wish maybe do
one more for averaging purposes and then
just change a mesh a little bit after
that Martin two dollars Steve GN
coasters or shot glasses question mark
we talked about doing coasters I have
some some ideas that I think would be
pretty cool for those but have not
explored the manufacturing options yet
stuff I want to do and I will see I have
a few ideas but
it is definitely something we've
discussed just need to put together a
design and figure out like if we want to
do anything special with materials
because that would require probably a
different factory contact than might be
typical shot glass has no current plans
but we I mean we have these the pint
glasses are up on the store on store
deck here and exits net if you wanna
pick them up it is the blue cobalt glass
with the teardown logo that's the same
one that I've got on the shirt today and
that has the the gold rim as well so
running our third test pass for a 4.7
gigahertz one point two four volts and
it hasn't died and one point two four is
surprisingly stable actually because
this was not stable
well blenders a Navy X load it was not
stable in blender for more than about
six minutes although this is only
running for one minute so whatever I
will see we'll see how long our holds
keep start temperatures down a bit
wishbone
two dollars beetle Adventure Racing with
car radiator it makes sense I need to
look up beetle Adventure Racing because
it keeps popping up every stream McFly
the old Volkswagen Beetle was air cold
so this must be more powerful I don't
know anything about the old Volkswagen
Beetle but I will say that there are
there there are plenty of cars that
would do well with this radiator setup
if you had adapted it I think just not
very good ones okay so what's our third
score looking like for averaging
purposes
that's what we need to do - talks about
wanting to do more car reviews he should
he should do the opposite instead of we
used a car radiator for a PC we used a
PC radiator for his Lambo ten thousand
nine ninety four okay so let's just
change a Bosch I don't know what stable
on this let's try start with thirty two
and go from there especially if I can do
it without changing any of the mesh
voltage okay we got some store orders
thank you as I said one of the best ways
to support us during the stream is
through the Gianna merch store so Jordan
from I believe that's Alberta yes
Alberta picked up the 15 ounce ceramic
mug Thank You Jordan been to Alberta a
few times at Calgary and Banff so we're
leaving 47 alone it's just my mocks not
on let's just see 32 on mesh might crash
without changing anything else will see
the see if that has any meaningful
impact - has a Lambo no Linus has a car
he calls a Lambo which is I think now
dead I'm not sure I don't know if they
they got rid of it or not I think he
still has it so when I went to LTX Linus
is like fanmeet and retain they had his
car there which i think is maybe a Honda
Accord or something like that feel free
to correct me in chats like a civic or
an accord and it was previously painted
pink I believe by Nikki V and who worked
for him and at LTX his fans did things
like poured paint all over the radiators
and pour pour paint all over the seats
stick glitter all over everything I mean
it was it was bad enough that driving
home he probably could have been pulled
over for littering cuz there was
definitely stuff coming off that car
so no he does not have a Lambo he has a
car they call lambda because it was
painted pink and I had racing stripes
which which obviously makes it a
Lamborghini okay so physics run times by
extreme Civic thank you it is still pink
I'm being told by chat 2003 seven Civic
is what a line of strives for his
Lamborghini okay it doesn't have a new
net car now to probably her probably I
would hope so given how beat up that
they know ice oh that's right rod
Rosenberg's in chat hey rod sir rod
works works with Bob Stewart PS mods he
is a large part of the vs mods team they
do some of the best case mods I've ever
seen and Rob does a lot of the I guess
rod is it correct to say machine work I
think I think that's correct to say a
lot of machine work for those case mods
and he said in chat I made a spoiler for
the Lambo that's true he didn't make a
spoiler for lionesses car I don't know
if he has it on the car though Chevy
Volt now no frozen
okay so froze we eat some it did just
fine with the core where it is I have
passed three times so we can assume it's
fine so probably need some V mesh on
there probably just some B mesh to help
out a bit
okay just reading chat hybrid car not
electric surprisingly ugly it's
surprisingly not ugly - okay I wasn't
say that's mean then say about lionesses
new car then again he deals with
comments all day V course fine be mashed
let's just bump that let's just tell it
I'm like it's just hot one point one and
let's do an encore offset of 500
millivolts and I'll do I owe at one
point one where you leave si alone for
now let's see how that goes
see if it's stable this time those are
some really good really good things you
can change Forex 299 specifically so X
299 it's really hard to talk while
reading chat X 299 you have a lot of
options for tweaking uncor and IO is
actually one of the most important
things just for the platform as a whole
for any big overclocks
you have to be careful with it if you
start pushing too high could definitely
degrade the chip kind of like SOC
voltage can on IMD CPUs so you push it
too hard you'll have degradation you
might even not know about it until
couple months down the line when you
can't hold the same clock at a given
voltage anymore so be really careful if
you start tweaking things like IO and I
say voltages on different platforms si
is a little bit more brutal on a system
agent as I say things like the desktop
DT platforms s3 CPUs and then SRC is
it's obviously important but you have to
be careful with it on AMD CPUs and rise
and rise in 2000 have different
tolerances for that too so be careful
what you're looking up
okay current clamp still going so uh
just trying to see if rod and posted
anything in chat I don't see it if he
did someone's so on says read the title
that says the name of the processor
think they're playing into the meme of
Steve what CPU is that because they like
to make me say it
but joke's on you I don't only answer
that if you pay me be a super chat okay
so no load right now I was like 11 apps
cuz not doing anything oh that is very
high for a loading screen but that's
because it's at a high voltage there we
go might crash on out now there we go
now we're at thirty twenty nine point
six thirty point seven plus or minus 0.4
because I have still haven't zeroed it
damn that radiator is huge yes I should
fly show off the system again in a
second so some super chats David Allen
of hunt $5.00 thank you that's 240
Miller CLC if you don't like or care
about things like RGB LEDs
well first I'll note that I if you can
do it if you can fit in your case I do
prefer to 80s because the cost
difference is often really small and the
performance is is noteworthy especially
the acoustic performance so if you can
fit a 280 I would recommend you stretch
the budget there but the good news about
240 and 280 CLC is most companies make
both and it's the same thing except the
bigger fan and radiator so
recommendation applies both places but
for 240s if you don't care at all about
RGB your LEDs or anything like that the
EVGA CLC 240 is cheap and it's like
really cheap and they're always attacked
pumps except for that new course r1
which I have on the way that's cool it
but they're all pretty much a Sutekh
pause so survive 11003 no real score
movement just from that I think we have
to do more with the CPU first it's four
point seven one point two for one point
one for IO and mash 32x for the mesh
ratio eleven thousand three other than
EVGA is CLC 240 if you do like LEDs
Corsairs
what do they call it h100 I Pro and I
haven't tested the new ones so keep that
in mind
they each fight the h1 type row I've
tested that's an 8 section 6 pump it's
not hugely different
honestly the impellers bit better it's a
metal impetus of the plastic one the
tolerances for permeation permeation is
less of a concern on that one over a
longer period of time so you see more
six year warranties on some of those and
then other than that it's a bit
expensive so not really my first choice
unless you really like RGB or the look
of it
fractals I am NOT a huge fan of but if I
don't know they they stuff all the
cables into the tubes leaving so if
you're kind of a cable management not
that might be worth looking at as well
okay so yeah no real score movement here
let's restart it and push the the core
xes $2 hey tie your hair back near the
fans yes they are they're quite
dangerous we'll walk over there again
soon and take a look at everything
I guess roll up pup Shepard $5 thank you
hi Steve a longtime listener first-time
caller I love the show we got so much
snow in New York what's it like there
there in your neck of the woods we're
good right now although I would very
much appreciate some snow so I can put
this radiator in it and not need any
fans although we'd probably melt through
it pretty quickly so I think we're up in
the 60s now Celsius although we are
still rising and we will continue to do
so very rainy here otherwise though so
we're gonna go 48 1.24 V course though
I'm not gonna touch that I'm I'm
tiptoeing up because I think we're gonna
blow through this voltage at some point
and start crashing let me walk through
the rest of the bench while we get this
one up and running and then I'll go
through more I keep almost tripping on
that super chats and store orders and
stuff and normal chat so if you missed
it this is the radiator effectively a
car radiator and it's got four 200
millimeter fans on the front we didn't
have a mounting plate unfortunately this
takes a special adapter didn't have the
plate for the back
otherwise we'd have eight of them on
there or at least six then we have four
140 fans on the back that are actually
pretty low rpm they're about 1,400 these
are about 800 I think so not to know
it's actually one of the quietest
overclocking setups we've done while
still being very effective and that's
because gigantic and we also have a dual
DBC pump from ek we have some tall UK
reservoir that I'm always nervous about
because it's kind of precariously
mounted the tubing is all it's it's
pretty insulated tubing so it's great
for sub ambient or even slightly
sub-zero overclocking like with salt ice
or something because it'll take longer
to start forming condensation and you
can just wrap it with shop towel if you
need to but it does take longer to form
condensation typically rest of the bench
we showed previously so x29 dark
motherboard
RTX 20 80 TI FTW 3g skill Trident II
black memory at currently XMP which is
3600 and we can push 4000 on this pretty
easily typically and that's about it
a X 1600 I for the power supply if you
missed all that earlier okay so 3d mark
and you see if it crashes this time
because it's 4.8 gigahertz now we're
just for perspective on air by which I
mean not not exotic cooling on air our
39 edx ii was was capping out at about
4.8 4.9 before i put in a nice bucket
and we're already getting close to that
target with the 9090 DX e that said i
never put the 790 XE under this radiator
so not a linear comparison but my theory
is that the 90 90 DX e will have more
overclocking Headroom once we solve the
thermal issue and there is a big one
because the dee-lighted 790 DX e was
significantly cooler in some of our
testing we have that in the review it's
really interesting if you haven't see it
you should check it out because because
the the test results we show it's
quartic or deltas were a big problem for
standard application workloads like
blender this is not
blender is like a really short test so
it's not comparable to what we're
talking about in the review where it has
more time to reach study state like a
real user would do so quarter Cordell
it's a big problem but fortunately for a
one-minute test not an issue today for
us and the solder is also potentially
beneficial once we move to something
like dice whereas it's actually not
helpful for what we're doing today it's
it's worse than liquid metal and
removing the silicone adhesive that's
big part of it okay a couple of store
orders thank you for sending those
picking those things up so we got
Garrett from Michigan picked up a an
anniversary edition teal logo shirt this
one right here thank you for picking
that up Garrett we also have the the
Raglan hoodies we just restocked today
those have this design on the back
except it's in white the the anniversary
there's not the teardown logos on the
back of that one and then we've got the
GN logo on the heart location for that
Raglan hoodie Thank You Garrett we have
clay from Los Angeles it looks like I
know sorry I saw LA and I just assumed
Los Angeles was that Louisiana and an
autographed mod man thank you for
picking that up like I said those are
coming in soon first half of December
we'll get them out in time for Christmas
for people in the u.s. almost certainly
unless there's some shipping issue
international you can email support at
gamers Nexus not not if you're concerned
or you have any questions he can help
you out
11200 force that's at 4.8 and it was
stable I do not believe this is stable
on anything else but it's stable four
times by extreme so I went out on two or
four pretty damn good our goal tonight
is twelve thousand four hundred and
twelve I believe was the the score to
beat and if we can beat that that would
be impressive because that score was on
on ice water what the semi I need a oxy
that was our previous high
okay let's just let this run again and
this also means we can keep our current
draw our current a lot lower because the
voltage hasn't needed to be pushed
nearly as high as I thought it would
tonight which is really great news for
our overclocking potential star star
star star in chats as I actually love
this glad to hear ya la equals lower
Alabama apparently okay I am Bob is
probably the simplest message we've seen
tonight hello Bob Henry any reason you
didn't use a car radiator fan well we
had these and they work pretty well and
we had a mounting kit for them and all
that stuff so made sense to use these
okay store order from Philip and Arizona
Thank You Philip
picked up a oh I thought it was the oh
you did pick up the cobalt blue
it's her down pint glasses so thank you
picks up one of those a blue print shirt
so our I think it's our only non black
shirt other than the Raglan hoodie is
the blue print shirt and then also the
tear down crystal and medium size that
is actually we gave one of those to our
friend Sasha in Taiwan earlier this year
for being the best tour guide because
the products at the show were lackluster
and so we had to give one to someone and
it was Sasha for me to get to our guide
and the Guan ha Digital Plaza
I'm trying to try to keep them with all
the chats call your local HVAC
specialists I think we're good okay so
that's were significantly different no
not really
okay that's within variance so eleven
thousand one eighty we're at like eleven
thousand to four for the first run the
only reason I reran this was it got a
quick eye on the thermistor for one pass
no serious like endurance testing here
or Max is about 66 I'm like I said this
is a terrible way don't ever look at
your your thermals this way if you're
trying to gauge actual performance by
looking at just like the max column a
really bad way to do things we don't we
don't do our thermal testing that way
the reason I'm looking at it though is
because purpose of overclocking like
this we are going to be limited in
frequency by our hottest core and so if
any cores are ever throttling then
that's a problem and I should dial it
back so we're just gonna reboot and see
what we can we can get any chance of
I've got a couple of questions here
super Chad's give me a second I'll get
through those think we want to do four
point nine and see if this crashes on on
one point two four volts it probably
will four point nine okay I keep saying
that though I said that at four point
seven as well not a gaming CPU what CPU
is it it's a 99 ATX II which is a 79 80
X II have you ever it's hey steve-o you
ever tried at liquid nitrogen
overclocking from a tuna user in chat
yes not in our own studio but I I did a
video with Roman with their Bower I
think two or three years ago at Computex
where we got some hands-on with L&amp;amp;T
overclocking it was fun I mean it's it's
you know it's like a 30-minute setup so
can't really get to hands-on he did a
lot of the work for all the media who
came by but and of course they already
knew about how the CPU would perform so
that was my concern but I did get to
learn
L&amp;amp;T pouring I learned kind of management
of the liquid nitrogen oh yeah this is
instant instant crash like it's windows
is non-responsive so that's no good
I learned a bit about managing the setup
though which is important and something
that would have been harder to learn on
my own so now I just need to actually do
some of that here okay some super chats
to read so we have a tough biker $5.00
Steve can you build and try a bond
cooler on a modern system old-school
style I and you link something which I
can't click I mean I'm gonna go with
probably no on that question 1.25
okay so we've got we're pushing for 4.9
gigahertz here and just being at 4.8
that 1.24 is already better than the 798
exe was problem is again well somehow
eight exe got there but not without a
lot of help from sub ambient cooling so
if this can get there without sub
ambient cooling that would be great
it's just a question of can we get to
where the sudden IAD XE was with sub
ambient Coulee and I think that answer
is probably no but our goal is twelve
thousand four hundred points or so and
red eleven I think eleven thousand two
hundred or something right now let's see
if that's stable let's check the current
draw to Kevin bagging ski five dollars
hey Steve if you want to cool that
radiator maybe try a fish tank with a
roll of r22 insulation should be fairly
cheap and better than an open-top cooler
that's an interesting point I actually
bought some insulation from kingpin I'll
pull it out one second so I bought
bought some of this from kingpin and he
shifted out of it from Taiwan so that's
where he lives so I don't think this is
what this is what you mean for the fish
tank idea but bought some of this for
the board
so just insulating the board from
condensation drip off of tubes and
things like that or off the L&amp;amp;T pot in
the case of going dry ice that is what
we would use so I bought some of that
from him a lot of some other things like
more of the kingpin thermal paste and he
wrote on that piece of paper over there
because he he saw my name on the order
knew who I was I didn't tell him I was
ordering it and just throw it to my best
fan KP and I think that's a reference to
like Street Fighter or Tekken someone in
check and helped me out there's a
character in one of those fighting games
that when he got a KO he would have a
note that said to my best man
signed by that character someone help me
out in chat tell me who that was or what
game that was do you turn out to court
since you're doing 3d mark actually turn
it off Coors does not help with times by
extreme we've tried it looks like the
stream is catching up to where we are
right now so I'm just waiting to see
what Chad says oh nice that Corsair RGB
starter set was in the shot with it
crayons okay it's waiting for Chad to
catch up to see if anyone can help me
out with the name
that's not launching let's try again
Johnny Cage Thank You Johnny Cage I
don't know if he is so I don't know if
he's a Johnny Cage fan like if that was
his his main when he played it or if
human played fighting games or if that's
just he was just being a dick not sure
yeah so not stable
we need more voltage we're at 1.25
Mortal Kombat's Johnny Cage it's Danilo
your cameraman is great on point he says
he says okay Kevin from New York ordered
a lightweight Raglan zipper hoodie thank
you Kevin
picking one of those up you just got
them in they were all at zero except for
like small and 2x I think they're all
gone I missed the BIOS screen on that
sorry okay so this is a 99 80 X see if
you missed that I'll walk you through
the rest of it later chad is still
talking about Mortal Kombat someone else
is saying ken power street fighter input
an output radiator temperatures would be
epic yeah we had those for the for the
ice setup we had that but I have not set
it up here and that would have been cool
it wouldn't be too hard just didn't
think to do it
it was numb walk around by default one
point at one point two six give that
stable four point nine any plans for G
on shoes nope
so that one quickly use a fishtank
chiller we will do some kind of sob
ambient at some point
okay see that holds super chats still
catching up perpetually H Marc Bouwer
$10 Canadian thank you any chance of
more 6x anniversary teal logo shirts
crazy sizing that means that it's just
slightly smaller than a 3x where I am
the teal logo shirts are so those are
made of the u.s. they're pretty standard
US size in the I think I don't know if
we have any 6x in stock we had some I
try to order like one or two with every
run so keep an ear out for when I say
because we try to accommodate all the
sizes we can and I think we still have
like some extra smalls and some other
sizes just because just in case but I do
try to order a couple just to
accommodate everyone each run so keep an
ear out for next time I say we we
restock the t-shirts because I'll
probably try and get another one or two
in with that run
okay win racer 16 $5.00 any tail logo
shirt sin 3x coming in it's great
looking shirt we got a lot of size
questions today
are we out are we out of a lot of those
teal shirts I didn't know we were that
low so I'm sorry guys
let me see teal tri-blend I think
tri-blend only goes up to 4x I don't
think we get bigger than that we have 4x
and tri-blend we don't have any 3x and
then we have we have one 5x in the
cotton zero six and then we have zero
three so exactly the sizes everyone will
hots for gone not stable but it got it
got further this time last time it
crashed more or less instantly crashed
on the desktop it black screen and this
time we at least got the application
booted so need more voltage right well
4.9 gigahertz right now at 32x match
that needs to go up we are at one point
1v match 500 mega 500 millivolts encore
offset and one point one IO voltage just
to give you a run through all the
settings 249 just push this let's just
do one point - nope one point two eight
I'm just trying to find stability
without torturing the thermals too much
on this thing I know I can do four point
nine I just don't know where the voltage
needs to be what's chat saying
still still catching up on chat nice tip
on the shutdown switch wasn't aware of
that shut down switch is great if you're
working in a bench setup not so helpful
if you are obviously if you have it in a
computer but so there's some really good
just on that point probably my favorite
button on any motherboard I think is
about the same as builds Ords which is
the safe boot button and typically read
a C's for sure has it MSI has it on some
and EVGA I think has it where you push
it and it retains all your settings but
it doesn't apply them which is extremely
useful if you know you just need to
change the voltage or you just need to
change the frequency and not blow away
all the settings work you did yes
there's one on here red button it's also
a retry switch on some boards that's
really useful for memory training you
just keep slamming and retry over and
over until it finally boots does some of
the tertiary timings and and non-exposed
timings will keep training as you
continue to try and do and so if you
keep hitting retry there's a chance that
eventually it will train and the timings
will hold they'll be stable not a great
idea for constant use because if
anything ever happens to the settings
you don't have to retrain again and
booting sucks but it's fine for
something like this and it looks like it
might nope okay so it crashed right here
last time let's see how much much
further it gets I don't know I bought
this right I think 1.28 right now sam
says safe boot has saved me it a ton of
times yes it's very good grimmy 12 no
crash five dollars Canadian yo fam I
know you probably mentioned it before
but status on the dark mouse pads
actually I haven't mentioned it for a
while so they are if you mean like the
the black and blue like the one I'm
using over there they're getting made so
we have them in production and we're
just waiting on them to exit production
under ship so probably a couple weeks
something like that maybe two to three
I'm not positive not guaranteeing it but
that would be my
based on my experience with with the
same people who made this one I think
about 2 to 3 weeks maybe before they
come in to us and then they can go out -
you haven't listed them on the store yet
though that's nice so a more voltage
need to continue raising vcore what do
you use for inventory Cole $5
what's he use for inventory management
software well for the store it's just
it's just all baked in and then I saw a
QR codes and was interested in it for my
company we don't use anything for like
right now we don't have a system for
scanning those codes I looked into it
briefly and we got a XI 1.3 volts we had
a scanner and I had some software and it
worked
but I wasn't too happy with it so for
now we're just thinking the codes on
there because I know there's good soft
right I don't
I can't Road it's called - use one
that's pretty good but I don't know if
they're too happy with it I'm not sure
but there's software out there you can
just scan it when you want to check it
out or in or something so it's more
preparation for the future we're not
actually using the codes yet
okay but you can use a visual databases
for good inventory tracking all right so
1.30 volts is our news setting and we'll
see if this one holds at 4.9 gigahertz
and if it does I'm gonna have to check
on the temperatures because we're really
climbing pretty fast and voltage and
that's gonna make the temperatures climb
as well let's show system again spend a
little while so if you missed it and
sorry if this is repeat but it's a Mora
for 20 radiator Fort Knox with 200
millimeter fans kind of fun to look at
anyway and it has a special mounting
bracket for those not really meant for
them I think you can mount nine 120 s on
it or something to that effect
and oh no eight nine 140 s nine three
six nine nine eleven forty s can go on
there so the backside has four 140 s on
it we kind of just stopped short it
could do more but it's in a push-pull at
the top like I don't know 30% 35% has
four 140 s on it and those are on there
because they're helping guide the air
over the vrm where i want more
specifically because the cold air coming
out that's cool
and then DBC dual D DC pump from ek
biggie K reservoir and this is all
hooked up by zmt tubing which will be
helpful so I've got QD season at this
times quick disconnect like right here
and I have two of those in there three
of those in there where you can just
disconnect the radiator and dunk it in a
nice bucket and that obviously was
intentional so we can do that in a
future stream if we want to and then the
bench is an X 299 dark motherboard which
we've used for all of these X 299
overclocking streams card is an RT x 28
T IFC I'll be doing absolutely nothing
right now
it's like no graphics panting the fans
don't even spend during these g.skill
transy black from memory okay what's our
current
amperage
where I know I missed the test so I
can't see what it is that means a past
hey it past eleven thousand three to the
eighth so one point three was was stable
four point nine gigahertz finally one
point three zero volts stable at five
and thousand three fifty eight
huh we got a long way to go to twelve
thousand four hundred but maybe with
some memory overclocking I can get us to
to get some gains a bit faster it's a
quick test here before I reboot and push
things further we need to see what kind
of temperatures we're sitting at right
now and I would also like to see the
power consumption so we'll check
hardware info after this run and just
see what the the maxes are check power
consumption during the run
Adam Schumann senior $5 when do the new
mouse pads go up on the store blue and
black also still waiting for snowflake
and midnight plush figures yes we are
we're aware of the demand for that and
have discussed it new mouse pads like I
said probably a couple like maybe three
weeks let's call it but hopefully a bit
sooner maybe two I guess with potential
holidays and shipping delays might be
more like three Bruno a Cabral $10 in
the the letter R for the currency cuz
that's all
YouTube tells me about it after Delia
and liquid metal my 7700 K I need to
check the power
thirty-four amps 35 amps occasionally so
if you're wondering about the power but
it's plus or minus 0.4 right now it's
about 400 watts a little more actually
it's like 420 watts
do something with that deal it in liquid
metal 7700 K runs at 5.30 yards that's
really high no one point 5 to 5 volts
that's also really high or 5.2 1 point 4
or 5 volts both AVX stable prime 27.9
load max times around 75 to 65
respectively package and hot core we're
running this 24/7 degrade my CPU I can't
answer that with certainty but things
like Si and an SOC on and the OL for
sure degrade stuff if you push them too
high 1.5 I feel pretty uncomfortable
with though I will say that 1.53 is what
you're at for voltage which just I don't
know I would be curious how oh yes I
forgot I cut my finger open on that
radiator so touching anything oh that
hurts I would be curious if it's
actually at one point five three volts
or if there's a lot of V Group what you
should do is check your load line
calibration setting you might already
know this if you're that high with
frequency check load line calibration
and see see what you're at for the LLC
because if you're typing in 1.5 3 but
it's actually putting out like 1.4 and
that's a obviously huge difference that
should be accounted for but it's genuine
1.53 I would say I'd I'd prefer to step
it down personally okay so our hottest
temperatures here are in the 70s I think
I'm seeing 80s yet we're actually doing
pretty well this is really shockingly
good so a giant radiator running test
for only a minute of course and soldered
so better than thermal paste but where's
them liquid metal working out pretty
well for us today
what's chat saying are you selling this
cool Ian for the 9900 K you bled for
this thing someone says you remember you
remember the motherboard rants video yes
yes he the author of that article did
say I bled for this thing when talking
about how awful it is to build your own
computer so water cools answer the
question I'll sign it water cool sells
these radiators and as for the 9-yard k
we have some ideas but not ready yet
with them 50 try 50 let's try 5
gigahertz all cores that would be we're
already doing better than our 79 80 XE
except for the ice part but I also need
to really push memory that's getting
kind of old that XMP this is not really
good how are you measuring power
consumption so when I gave the number a
minute ago it's not total system it is
at the EPS 12-volt cables so that is
like CB u plus V RM efficiency losses
power consumption super chats we got
Quebec clover maple 5 dollars Canadian
approximately 15 Americans hence for
Easter I love the show I love you well
thank you clover maple much appreciated
Linus Linus was also throwing pennies at
me in a previous stream although I think
his this was a little less kind of
course all all in getting fun I threw
pennies at him later
except my pennies were worth more so he
got more money out of the deal and I
said okay
well or stop 1.3 balls I not gonna trick
me that time I'm pretty sure it's not
stable so I might just start pushing
that voltage up a bit more Sam will you
test SLI scaling and your r-tx
testing we are certainly looking into it
actually right now the other room
I mean oku 94 99 thank you
here's a few bucks for office snacks
much appreciated we go through them
quickly also update on the blue black
mouse pads these are really popular I
know you all like submitted the
questions obviously before I answered it
so but yeah just just in case like maybe
calling it about three weeks I'm hoping
for two but I think realistically like
three it's not listed on the story yet
so okay got a store order mod Mac
autographs thank you very much so mark
from Texas picked up an autographed mod
Matt crashed immediately thank you for
picking that up like I said the mod mat
is is my favorite product we sell
because it's completely custom it's
really high build quality we think and
also I use it every day
so we I'm always excited to see the sell
because people seem to like them and
that that's good that's that's what I
want that's what I would like in the
products that we make so those are
shipping we'll be getting them the first
half of December if you're in the US
there's a very good chance we'll get it
before Christmas
barring any weird shipping issues and
international of course we will try our
best but international it can be tricky
sometimes man how far it's going alright
let's push this so 5.0 let's turn on
lock on first apparently let's do one
point three two and just see if we can
get that clock stable and then I want to
push XMP or turn off execute after that
and push the the memory frequency and
timings that picking up on the mic
some loud noises near us okay
Steve Strazza in chat and serpent xsf
hello serpent than and Strazza good to
see you guys
no one is getting five gigahertz before
one point 4 volts I did it on the Saudi
90 DC actually although one point four
made it a lot easier but I mean that's
part of what we're doing here is I
haven't had a chance to really test how
this one scales with the it's it's
supposed to be a bit more mature as a
chip than the first one we had so we'll
see if it scales any better it might be
a better bin I don't know J's 7090 DXE
was crazy he's like the most golden
sampled CP I've ever seen and I do not
think we got one of those here but it
would be nice one one can dream to have
CPUs as good as the ones Jay ends up
with
right chess Bruce I'm in the pub
watching you pretty pretty cool that you
actually definitely are not watching it
on the TVs there but on your phone still
counts I miss when when Starcraft was
big enough that people were starting to
play it in in bars like where they call
it a bar craft they called it never want
to want to watched it but I liked
watching the eSports events at around
the same time GSL gstl are good and I
think they've all been revived I haven't
watched though
do you play star citizen no but we do
have like 50 interviews with chris
Roberts and the rest of his team from
years ago 0.36 why not
we will see if this one dies
what CPU is it's the 99 80 XE okay let
me catch up on super chats a bit about
40 minutes behind them now but if I do
like 10 I can be only 20 minutes behind
on them
stridor early on $1.00 no message thank
you
next one is $2 and it's regular regular
super chat can you t pose for 10 seconds
I'm being told by being told by legal
counsel
the camera operator Andrew not to do it
I do appreciate that it's the same exact
message every time though all lowercase
no - between TN pose no punctuation
jeepers
I don't I don't trust why you would need
that mr. wobbles $5.00 hello computer
would you recommend for a streamer
editor musician youtuber between the 999
40x with no real budget cap between them
40 X is the 14 core the question I guess
is how much does your software leverage
the course because there's some
production software we've seen like
Photoshop that really likes frequency to
a point where 9900 K is is most the time
better than a seven nine eighty eight or
nine nine eight exe or testing we showed
that the what was it premiere tests we
did definitely our favorite on the 980
XC if you do video production I wouldn't
recommend buying that one just because
the price and you're talking about wow
that was that sounded like over current
or something over current or over over
temperature not sure which it was a
shutdown there I guess probably over
temperature we should not be going over
current anyway I like to the 79 60 X a
lot now I guess the 99 60 X is basically
the same thing
I like thoughts TV a lot because there's
a good balance then I have 40 X is fine
to build Zoid uses the saudi 940
actually used to anyway but
it just depends on the software because
like for premiere I would be tempted to
go 9900 K to save a whole lot of money I
know you say it's no object but I save a
whole lot of money you can always put it
towards like another camera or maybe new
lights or something like that to and
enable IG IG P and D software encoding
and you get pretty damn good performance
it's not quite as good as the high court
count CPUs but it's pretty damn good
let's go back down to 49 we maybe try 50
on a few cores a little bit later but
first I am curious to see how high this
mesh goes
I'm curious let's get the memory back up
first 4000 I need to push that voltage
more later and we push those bit more
later - Wow let's just do it all now
let's see see what profiles I have left
over to make this faster rip stable 3600
black edition okay and then we're gonna
have to step down some things so
previously here's this very convenient
here are our settings for the 79 ad xee
with liquid metal and an ice bucket we
were at 51 on 4 cores and then 50 on the
rest and then 30 for mesh this was a
good overclock but it was on a much
cooler setup sub ambient and then we had
1.46 faults for 51 acts on 4 cores so
we're obviously changing that we're
obviously gonna change this to down to
49 and we'll try to step up maybe for
course 250 later and then we had
previously 1.38 for V mesh that is so
high I was not only like 1.1 here second
ago so let's step that down to 32
because I know that's stable 1.1 or I
think it is si doesn't really need to be
increased right now
and then I oh it doesn't really need an
increase we're at 1.1 previously for
that although we might have to push it
with some of the memory clocks 500 is
good okay I think we're good to go let's
try that actually I need to double-check
the memory yeah okay let's try that and
the memory gets some cooling this time
doesn't really need it but it's got
those giant fans pushing air onto it
they talked $1.99 what CBO is that 980
XC he damn it Alex Meyers five dollars
here's some NC monies don't drown and
Hollis rain there's quite a bit of it we
could we could harvest it for liquid
cooling today Exxon five dollars what
are your thoughts on NOK toes Redux
lineup as compared to their standard
offerings honestly no real thoughts
other than the gray I guess so
like you've got you go brown or you go
gray and then later they realize that
like oh we're adding colors we should
add something standard like a black crow
max version or whatever no real thoughts
though on the patreon behind-the-scenes
thing I stream I have a fantastic update
there and we're not there yet but once I
can actually do it once I am unburied
from all these product launches one
after another then we can start looking
into actual thoughts on on that question
so we've done a memory overclock here
see if that holds and like I said
picking stuff up from the store tonight
is one of the best ways to support our
streams if you enjoy watching them we
have big and small line so you can get a
keychain for 10 bucks we've got stickers
on there basically like almost a bumper
sticker style decals and then we have
the mod mats of course coming in soon we
have the Raglan hoodies we're just
restocked for two-tone lightweight
hoodie and then we've got things like
the beer glasses and the ceramic mugs as
well have a lot of things on there we
have some good variety so check it out
on stored I Kara's excess night I'll
shout out your first name and where
you're from if you pick something up
during the stream
is alive I don't think it's alive but
we'll leave it alone for a second
Tim Reddington $5 do you or your team
drinking craft beer I live in western
mass so I have treehouse trillium Hetty
topper etc in my backyard I don't think
any of us do but I know some guys who do
drink you drink craft beer and beer in
general and they also do streams and
sometimes occasionally get blasted in
the face by the bottles that they open
talking of course about Pauling tile I
think they would have been live a couple
days ago I don't know if they skip this
week or not please be ok so that was no
good that's uh let's bump io a bit and
see if that helps didn't really push
mash any crazy amount I swear it was
about pushed pushed memory it's probably
needs about bio a bit the rest should be
stable okay io oh no 1.2 let's do that
one the mash can stay as it is okay try
that
grimmy 12 $10 thank you hey hello here's
more money for my guy mr. Jesus man are
all radiators with decent pumps
effectively equal when you're replacing
the fans anyway I like fractal but oh I
think you were asking about the CLC's
earlier but if bad
besides fans I can avoid it's not bad
beside the fan I mean like the the the
fractal CL CS are just a Sutekh CLC's
like all the other agent XEL CS so if
you're replacing the fans anyway and you
can find a good deal on it maybe you
like how are the pump and the radiator
look or something I already like the
sleeve in or whatever then it's gonna be
the same as everything else once you
equalize the fans they're very small
differences so the difference is between
actually I'm gonna just let it be the
difference is between cool it a Sutekh
dinah tron a politic those are different
suppliers for the CLC's but this is rip
J for the username but if you're all
within the same supplier like all A's
attack and I'll same radiator size and
you equalize the fans and they're going
to be more or less the same they will be
within manufacturing variance where the
performance at that point is dictated
more by the pump speed which is just
variable it's it is it's about plus or
minus 10% speed from unit to unit okay
well at least we got a blue screen this
time set up a freeze that restart
mm-hmm so maybe a bit more voltage or
something Adam says I run only Maglev
fans they're fine fans they do pretty
well the one of our maglev is recently
won in a battle against a gentle typhoon
fan not benchmarking but because the
gentle typhoon fan blade fell into the
Maglev blade and then the maglev wand so
kudos to Corsairs engineering department
I guess don't know just everyone is
still 1.15 should be plenty I don't know
maybe the timings aren't stable anymore
might have to train into it
okay so we got some of these comments
talking about fans mr. doctor cheese and
chat says smiley face the only fan I
have is my Mahama and then Thai food and
fans are brittle grandma says yes that
much was apparent when it shattered not
really an intended to use case to be
fair I do like the Typhoon's a lot there
they were probably my favorite fan for a
long time but they're not meant to go
into battle with other fans still not
not stable so might need to step back on
the memory a bit which is sad because
these settings were stable previously
but it always gets a bit fidgety when
you're going between overclocking setups
I actually have a something pretty cool
we can show off while this is figuring
out its life so this is pretty neat that
is
that's from MSI really cool so this is
an old Lightning board obviously does
anybody know which Lightning it is it's
it's bit customized I'll walk you
through why in a second as I dial back
some of the stuff in BIOS
okay bit customers anyone know what
lightning that is
so this is an msi lightning and the it
does not have a GPU on it that's why
it's kind of interesting 770 getting
close I got a message from my
distributor I adjusted your mug stock he
says they are back in stock for the one
mug quantity okay cool
780 Ti is correct so this is the 780 Ti
lightning and the reason it's cool is
because it's actually not genuinely a
780ti lightning that is a modified 780ti
lightning so they only had a few of
these I think they made like 50 of them
or something and this is pre-attachment
of all the service mount devices so you
don't have any memory on there I don't
have the GPU on there I can actually
bring the GPU over to me one second so
this GPU is from Nvidia where I toured
their offices in 2012 and it's not it's
not the same one I don't know I mean
it's definitely not the same one I don't
think it's the same much definitely not
the same one but that's where it would
go so that's kind of what they look like
attach it like that with solder but
anyway I'm pre attachment for this stuff
and then the vrm is custom that's why
this is a bit different so these fats up
here this goes to the memory they
relocated it for this card it was made
for overclocking events and that's the
memory PRM on this one and then they
expanded the vcore vrm significantly
it's actually really cool pretty cool
custom board ms I'd dropped off for us
and it has three power headers it was
doing genuinely extreme overclocking
though it needed them or at least could
make use of them anyway
a truce areas strix vegas 64 OC song
says i don't know what the context is
but i read their comment i guess it's
what even happen there i just shut down
or something
where's our instability teeth ah should
be fine maybe 260 I'd be a bit
aggressive on refresh cycle oops
let's try 300 here just trying to get to
boot with the set of memory timings that
are a bit better
should I do lead my GPU no because if
you try to do that you see the only
thing there has to die so there's
nothing there's no lids take haha don't
do that like rip the the actual silicon
off yeah so that's that's what your GPU
looks like underneath for the person who
asks I don't know if you're serious or
not but if you were don't try and
delayed your GPU because he can't you
can take the cooler off and it looks
about like this and you can replace the
thermal paste I wouldn't recommend
liquid metal for GPU it's not really
worth it
they already have direct eye contact to
the the heatsink so kind of becomes
pointless at some point okay will it
survive
we got couple super chat actually a lot
to catch up on so like I said I'll get
through all these super chats and I just
yeah
keep in mind I run a bit behind because
the the volume of everything we're doing
all at once
and also the store orders like I got to
read off three new store orders for the
people who are supporting the livestream
thank you so super chat's slowed
thoughts on phoenix $4.99 thank you
thoughts on knock doors industrial fans
for custom loop they rated over three
three times the static pressure of the
non industrial fans looking to get a 45
millimeter plus raider if it's a fat
radiator more pressure will help they're
good I mean like I have one on here and
it's really loud we should actually if I
get this to boot again I should show you
the the volume difference but they're
loud so if you're okay with loud and
maybe it's like a server setup or
something like that
Enterprise setup production setup where
you don't care about the noise maybe
yeah they're good but it's kind of
brutal it's a nice if you have a head
room to run a fan curve and just keep
them at fifty percent of most the time
and then burst for high load Leviathan
Prem five dollars hello GN how goes the
overclocking so far as 8:42 p.m. it was
going very well at 8:43 p.m. right now
we're stuck because I tried to change
too much at once so I'm probably
reverted a lot of that but I think our
most recent score our goal is about
twelve thousand four hundred points
which is probably not achievable without
ice and we are currently at eleven
thousand 358 so or thousand points away
it was pretty damn good if I get the
memory working we might be okay
I just don't know blew away the settings
nice
is that gonna work yeah a nice load last
save settings is a great button so let's
do this let's kill the memory profile
and then apply XMP and what I'm gonna do
is see if that's stable now that stable
that means that we are unstable because
of the memory and if it's not stable
then that means I need to look at
probably mesh or core
so I'll just narrow down the point of
failure
okay just
ex-mp this time one-one sure maybe mesh
might need some more voltage will see
there's a lot of points of failure once
you start changing everything the grave
Accent $2 desolder delete it make it
even more pointless well I
considering the chances of it dying yes
Kravitz Erard 469 thank you can you say
Eric CBA you got vrm we cocked okay
Matthias to the hush did you turn off
two cores this is your 3d mark answer
that one earlier no we're doing times by
extreme which actually does benefit from
the extra cores I've tested that one it
does benefit from them actually pretty
noticeably it's like a couple thousand
points if you start turning off a bunch
of cores
maybe not for two but it's a lot okay so
if it's alive and it doesn't die this
time then we can assume it was the
memory overclock we can start fixing
things
okay
trying to keep up with what smash is it
only 4x4 use processors mash yes is 4x
series basically uncor is the idea for
that one store orders thank you for
purchasing stuff so we got Robert from
Thurmont picked up two of the mugs thank
you Robert mugs do we we have one out
somewhere yes it's a glass glassware
drink where is really popular with our
audience for some reason in particular
and got the mug and we've got the beer
glass we got a couple purchases of those
things today so thank you for picking
that up Robert and we had this by the
way it's been one of our longest selling
items and it always does really well I
guess cuz the high contrast looks pretty
cool we had a Karen from Baltimore
picked up and signed Maude Matt thank
you picking up one of those those will
be in the US in the first half of
December we'll be shipping them out
immediately when we get them after I
sign that one apparently and then we had
David from Georgia pick up a mod mat as
well so thank you for all those orders
Maude Matt's coming in soon this looks
like it is finishing this time so it
looked looked frozen for a second there
but it's going so this will be in soon
and this front we we have some cool
footage we need to show of how those are
made to some extent it's pretty
interesting takes a very long time to
make one of them which is this it's good
because I mean the quality is high
eleven thousand three seventy one is
that it's just hire from variants I
guess no no not that much higher okay so
we're at 11:35 84 that's 11 371 within
variance okay so it worked
memory was not happy which is a solvable
problem because this memory has worked
before with with the settings that were
in there
and we just need to maybe dial it back a
bit or something I had it under ice last
time so voltages I was pushing on IO and
si and mash and everything we're a bit
abusive for where we are today for
cooling
although the cooler is it's very
impressive it's not quite ice okay so
this does four thousand for sure no
problem
I fifteen really should be fine but
let's 15 was fine last time so I want it
to be 15 again this should be able to do
28 but let's see 30 because I think 28
is sometimes difficult on this one
38 should be stable for it
don't remember what I had TRC to Ithaca
look actually let's just do this let's
load that profile again and then step
everything back that should be the
easiest so 1.3 get back to the rest of
those in a second we go 49 for
everything mesh we haven't pushed past
32 yet on this board but let's kind of
limit what we're changing then one point
nine five one point three four the core
let's do one point two from yeah let's
do one point two four mesh well bump
that up more than we had before right
one point one eight five previously if
for SI one point three to four IO let's
try one point two five on IO 500 uncor
so let's let's do that that's just
higher voltages on mesh if that's no
good I'll step some stuff back on the
time inside
okay
it's reading chat people talking about
mercury and its evaporative properties
and how poisonous it is well I've seen
the random things chat is talking about
okay so we got some super chat send to
go through previously we had Medeiros $2
so it doesn't give you any extra OC
header and relating to turning off
course it probably does but the core is
help more in time spy extreme it really
likes frequency and threads what it
likes threads a lot so I think this is
still no-go on that let's give it
another shot see we can just train its
way onto booting what is the serpent xsf
what's the current clamp reading from 12
volts once you get it stable I think we
were pushing 548 watts in blender with
with 4.6 gigahertz at one point two five
which is what was required to remain
stable for a half an hour so it's a lot
there's a lot of wattage this may have
mmm maybe not almost trained into
booting or kind of borderline stable
yeah no that's not sure we're borderline
booting here let's try changing a few
things I really just want this these
timings because I think it'll get us
really close to the the 12,000 mark that
I want
firstly okay all right
dan Carlson you can reboot to UEFI
running shutdown / r / fw yes
or i can push the safe boot button but
that will also work the martin see 1 2 3
5 GBP thank you can we have an ice key
in the radiator and please tell me and
please and please tell me cameraman that
he is doing a great job got a pirate in
the audience yeah that's right I gotta
tell him please tell me cameraman that
is okay Kara man that he is doing a
great job okay
have I've completed my end of the
agreement
1.3 that's no good I gotta step back the
timings cuz we're gonna start running
too hot an ice cube in the radiator we
do an ice cube in the reservoir enough
people chant for an ice cube before that
no the stream I'll put one in the
reservoir can we get ok I had to scroll
ahead to find your message can we ice
cube
all right there this Casey Hancock one
dollar no message thank you FDM wo p
$13.99 thank you Steve what CPU is this
not keep up the great work
thanks for all the info you supply the
community what CPU is this not is is
quite a lot of CPUs ah
you're clever I'll give you that that's
very clever but I'm not I'm not gonna
I'm not gonna do it I'm not gonna fall
for it we have a whole box of CPUs that
it is not from our fan mail live stream
mostly old ones are pretty cool though
all right
so memory timings need to stop stop
being as good as they were the last time
I just have to have to accept that's not
gonna happen Alex Meyers $2 thank you
shut down switch was a command switch
not the mother word oh he's talking
about earlier when someone was saying
something about shut down switch data
file $10 Steve why are you
overcompensating with that big old car
radiator are you trying to send a
message is the ekw be you saying that
hardware isn't big enough yeah so it's
actually not the 45 40 would do well but
this seems like more fun I don't want
that OC robot we shouldn't do that
before the end of the stream or
something it has chat chanted about an
ice cube yet yep they're doing it ice
cube himself is going to trying to show
up all right so this comes back down
first of all and this probably can come
back down and then memory needs to get
worse in this category let's try and
leave forward is trying TC WL at 16
one command rate let's go up to 300 on
RFC I'm just gonna increase like
everything I tell it works
okay chat really wants an ice cube ice
tray it hasn't been filled don't want to
open this for one ice cube I get one I
think I also need to take the cap off
and the reservoir one ice cube is all
you get
we win so what's the temps well they're
about to be zero degrees Celsius when I
put this ice cube in there
you just wait some water will be close
to zero okay
how much how much does chat want this
this will stabilize our system so that
we can actually boot
let's chat saying right now I'll throw
read it in a second
are you ready for this
we have to be really careful this could
cause a reaction okay
do like the Star Trek Red Alert shake
chat so hyped on this ice cube like how
its somersault in yes that will change
everything it'll cause just enough
condensation on something the killer
component gasp yes that was a it's what
everyone wanted I think with Hades
Canyon and we were overclocking the Huck
now you got your ice cube I need to save
the rest of these for actual use
two ice cubes hype they say the camera
shake was rad
andrew says not rad apparently sorry
haha Vani
why are you doing this to me okay bet it
doesn't take long to melt well yeah
correct
so you can see a little dip in the
surface tension at the top from where it
was
two batters and got sucked through the
through the pump cog everything leave us
now the Ice Cube will take it from here
just put your system in the fridge yeah
I mean that would do something so booted
this time see if we can hold it got past
the windows loading screen nope
it really doesn't like that memory
overclock that's unfortunate so I want
it to work next time we look at the
reservoir its wine evocati productions
$10 I have a PBL OC 2,700 X with an SRC
of 1.0 for for that just now started
logging whe a machine check bus
interconnect error is always on core 5
no crashing though is it reasonable to
assume it's the soc voltage I don't know
one at 1.04 is pretty low so you could
try bumping it a bit you have room I
don't know if that's what it is but it's
easy enough to check it's booted this is
I don't know is it I hope it's not the
4000 that's unstable that would be kind
of weird since it has always worked for
huts do auto auto auto auto that's
really be able to do 16 that's really 20
but I have a feeling I'm IP RFC
see if that works start narrowing it
down maybe it's frequency or something
okay Nathan Tipton $5.00 thank you watch
your favorite quality of life feature
and enthusiast hardware since you've
been working in the industry that's a
hard question
safe safe beats a good one what is a
good quality of life feature I think
well since I started cable management I
guess because the owner the Antec 900
specifically was like the most popular
case that year antic still sells it and
it did not have any cable management it
just wasn't the thing yet no one no one
did that so kale management's gotten big
and I would say that's probably the one
of the biggest improvements over the
last decade or so that's a good question
though
toggle is to switch from multi and
single rail that's pretty nice he's a
Hancock two dollars nine gigahertz at
nine volts for the wind
nope not for the win
DJ Oreo $10 question what are calling
two GPUs an SLI and a custom loop have
you ever seen or have any date have you
seen or have any data as to if both cars
receive equal flow and in parallel
config I am Not sure I would record high
ly recommend thermal bench he still
gives its own bench not top nez calm yes
throne bench calm VSG he works for a
tech power up I think
occasionally or something but throne
bench comm was a sight that he
definitely maintained if not still
maintains and that has a lot of really
good flow tests he has flow meters and
everything it's pretty high-end stuff
okay so I'm thinking frequency here
which is awful
what if I change something else
let's try a few things that should be
fine
okay let's try a few things I really
want that the whole night I feel like if
it's just trash and without any of the
timings tighten then it's got to be like
frequency I know that those 4000 or
voltage
Paul's hardware had issues to marry
frequency everyone has issues it's never
a frequency it's talking to builds right
about this how memory over call he's
like the absolute most boring possible
thing you could Xiao okay you got a
couple store orders fortunately chat
keeps it really interesting otherwise
otherwise not interesting to just change
the numbers till they work for memory
Robert from Oklahoma picked up a
keychain thank you Robert and one of the
anniversary mugs as well
much appreciated its booting sort of you
got Christian in Sunnyvale you're out
near on your AMD picks up a cobalt blue
a tear down pint glass Thank You Kristen
for picking that up ok it's in set is
that the best it's gonna do is sit can I
actually load stuff the mouse kind of
froze for half a second so that's not a
good sign but there is the remnant of an
ice cube in the reservoir now in the
form of water that's okay well I got got
further than previously
hmm
Oh
the CPU that was 26 degrees well it's
it's doing nothing and an ambient of
probably like 23 or something so that's
pretty good all right I just want this
to run again our last score was 11 371
and we need like over 1.4 volts 5 to
push the CPU higher at this point so
that's not really going anywhere without
ice
but 49 is very good nothing to be upset
about especially because we're not on
any crazy cooling right now oh wait
we're not on any crazy any sub ambient
cooling right now don't know what I
really have room for
please work
okay
I don't know kind of a room on Io 1.35
is not where I want to be with that so
I'm gonna step that back in a second
super chats Christian caldron $10 needs
18 Noctua nfa 14 industrial fans at 3000
RPM make the hair flow its I mean 3000
rpms an awful lot for those fans and 818
would populate the whole thing you can
fit 9 on each side so you could do it
probably have to wear hearing protection
though ok well that is not gonna work
for us so that's everything
step step back the frequency I guess on
like memory just try and get a run in
there
that memory can definitely hold the
frequency it's just not doing it for me
today which we've seen before
and it could be IMC quality on the cpu I
don't know maybe bad bad IMC or
something and I'm trying my hardest to
make it worse okay
so we got Matt Brewer $4.99 can we see
the effect of 2080 TI s ion ray tracing
performance it is something we are
looking into Griffon $5 hey Steve was
wondering if you know anything about
chrome ax AF a 12 by 25 no actually I
don't I talked to him about that at
Computex in June and I don't think they
had any current plans but no we we for
sure talked with them about it but
unfortunately I don't think they had an
immediate launch window at that time
be mesh doing point to all of that
should be fine
memories got a step back it's just
really unfortunate because all of this
has held in the past so we'll see what
happens
as in the chat for Andrew the best
cameraman and 3d modeler I don't know
what this is in reference to there's
something I missed earlier it's the room
getting warmer it's a bit bit warmer
than it was originally but now with a
one degree Fahrenheit temperature
reduction now we will be unbeatable
everyone's saying eh are they saying eh
to make it work is that like the
opposite of f
it's trying
so all I've done is step back to
frequency I even dropped the voltages
back to more reasonable levels for all
the auxiliary stuff chat has been saying
a lot of A's which will make it work
apparently we got a super chat from
Dalton fare $5.00 thank you my strict
1080i OC runs in PCIe 8x only mode for
whatever reason on a Maximus 10 hero no
performance loss notice you probably
won't see any performance loss so that's
the good thing it's not really enough
going on there
it doesn't need the throughput of 16x so
you good there my guess would be it
there's a BIOS setting where you can
change the PCIe generation in the
Maximus 10 hero and so if you go look
for that setting I think it's under the
I think there's like a PCI subsystem or
like a PCH tab or something like that
but go dig through the tab it's not
under the main frequency or extreme
tweak Tweaker tab it's a different one
and you can change the PCIe generation
just change that to 3.0 and then you
should be good if that's the problem
I don't know I guess also make sure that
the slot is physically wired for 16 but
if it was already running that way then
also this is kind of going now I'm
saying kind of cuz I'm afraid of it but
it's kind of going the stream is rated a
for Andrew that's what the a is for nice
if I gave you five dollars would you say
meow nope
Sam says keep the memory below 3,100 the
board freaks out at 4,000 plus no it's
worked
this one has worked several times at
4,000 like in multiple streams it's just
not doing it this time but 3,800 is
working so that's good maybe we can try
some tighter timings so our previous
score finally getting scores again after
all that time maybe his score 11 371 and
that's 11 698 so that is quite a climb
four point nine one point three I have
to look at all of our other settings and
write them down 11 six nine eight okay
let's write down all the other settings
and then pull the timings back in for
the memory so I reset everything from
the instability apparently was the
frequency after all faint I least
expected we got a comment from 99 from
Center negative thank you why I has
aluminum as a case material dwindled so
much in popularity even Lee Anne Lee has
moved almost entirely to SEC seeing
glass here's money to stop mentioning
ltte those maples that's I'm not sure if
I should say the rest of it haha
so aluminum is really expensive it's
expensive make takes a lot of machine
time the material itself is expensive
and I would assume that it's entirely
cost driven solely emily has been known
for aluminum for a long time now lien
Lee also wants to make things that
actually sell in any kind of volume
greater than a couple hundred units so I
think they're starting to do more steel
and and some plastic too which is fair
aluminum is very expensive I I think
that's probably why I mean you can you
don't get quite the quite the build
quality with steel but it's still pretty
good so I guess as long as they're
targeting good enough then it's cheaper
okay co Garin $5 hey Steve I'm trying to
upgrade from an i-5 600k four point five
gigahertz horizon - which would you
recommend a 2,700 2,700 X 2700 and then
overclock it that is my firm
recommendation for that you don't have
to go through what I'm going through
tonight it's it's easy you need to type
in 4.0 or 40 or 3.9 would actually go
higher and rise until you do like 42
maybe 41 42 let's go for like 42 and
increment the voltage a bit and see how
that works for you no not one I'm not
doing 140 RCD see that's stable 3,800
must stay we'll see we got CL 15
Medeiros $2.00 we just want to crucify
you on a 20 ATT hi
well it's hot enough Daniel Giorgio
Wanda no message thank you
data file $5 Steve it's for the meme
tipo is to assert your dominance it
would probably be funny since the whole
principle the technology is thin do you
know what that what that is
it's a teen technology I don't know
whatever to eat pose
okay well I'm so much happier now that
this has worked once in the last 30
minutes not working at all was
sub-optimal but it worked once we'll see
if it works again see how 15 now
so other than this MSI board which was
pretty cool I mean if you missed it
earlier it's just it's a neat board
because it's customized for it was for
an overclocking event 780ti lightning
they added more phases to the core of
erm and they moved the memory of erm
phases over here and it doesn't have any
of the parts soldered to it so it's just
kind of neat but other than that they
also gave us and this has has been the
set background actually it was in one
video so far I also give us this which
is a a blank complete blank PCB for
actually all is it labeled on here yes
it is labeled on here you know
I don't think the labels on this side
did anyone know what that is
what motherboard that is you might have
already seen it that's an MSI board it
doesn't have any parts on it yet and it
is a pretty recent board I'll say that
so do you know which one that is
you might have already seen it in the
video playback and video still catching
up to where we are in reality so also
the test is in the process of is passing
so that's good test passed so what is
the motherboard for this PCB it's here
for creation there you go that is what
it is
so yes it's pretty cool that's what it
looks like before they put any other
parts on it and then they use
pick-and-place machines to drop like a
BIOS chips and MOSFETs and capacitors
all go through SMT lines and
pick-and-place lines and they're pretty
neat actually they have we have a video
of I think it's called how video cards
are made or how other words are made
it's in the gigabyte factory same idea
in Taiwan and the one they used there is
like that motherboard is missing its
motherboard so the pick-and-place
machine they had there they fill it with
components like a Gatling gun and it
just goes through and like punches them
down one after another it's a really
cool process to see we have some videos
of it on the channel but uh yeah that's
there's a blank board just kind of cool
okay so 11,000 751 that is an
improvement that's great we wanted
12,400 we're getting kind of close
actually 4.9 1.3 3800 CL 15 is our
settings and I look at the voltages too
so that was 11751 let's see if we can
get this a little bit a little bit
further now we're actually having some
success in the house that's great it's
time to push it back to a point where it
fails
okay
this is bad that you have to use a car
radiator because Intel CPS are that high
well I mean it is a hot CPU yes but to
be fair it's at almost 5 gigahertz and
it's at one point 3/4 so it's 18 cores
so it's hot yes definitely but I'm not
helping it any ok so let me write down
these numbers before I forget them and
we'll save a profile later - so these
specs or these settings I had 1.2 VSA
been out 1.18 5 VSA probably unnecessary
1.3 I also probably unnecessary boost
them all one before we drop the
frequency and then 1.2 v mash ok
okay that's tuned some other stuff
starting with all of these
let's try 20 let's try 260 there that's
kind of aggressive but kisi ke start
there see how that does
can anyone see my comment nope no one
can see it a couple of super chats and
store orders actually did I get yours
already we had one from Leif in
Washington who picked up an autographed
mod mat thank you leaf we will be
getting those in soon I'll be signing a
lot of them as soon as they come in so
thank you for picking that up big
support for us to do these streams next
one is from did you ever get that
working yes okay okay did you find a
task path yet or no yeah okay did you
record it with OBS
can you beam they're recording that way
I can copy it later that would be
helpful
and then I can follow up with you on
after I guess as we had Michael in
Pasadena picked up one of the mugs and
one of the beer glasses thank you
Michael let's get a run going here I
should check on the temperatures at some
point maybe after if this one passes
I'll check the temperatures
okay okay so we got one from Paul Robert
in Scotland got a good journey to go
picked up two of the cobalt blue beer
glasses
thank you Paul Robert Derek in Texas
grabs on the Mod bats Thank You Derek
it's launching hopefully it works Kyle
and in Virginia picked up two of the
ceramic mugs Thank You Kyle
like I said these have been really
popular item for us ever since we got
him in like a year ago at this point and
then we have another one from Martin and
Illinois who picked up a beer glass
Thank You Martin okay over locked the
router
add another Ice Cube my computer is
getting full how can you add more laughs
why chat doesn't change I like to I like
knowing that YouTube is storing
thousands of messages from the stream
and perpetuity most of which say things
like tipos F a and Ice Cube Anna Hart
Davis tweeting who's done that keep it
up we gotta earn their they got to earn
their keep of the super chat donations
Sean Collins five dollars Australian
thank you about 15 minutes behind a
super chats not as bad as it has been
I've brought you a beer enjoy - thank
you
would you comment on my build I don't
know where this link goes and it's URL
shortened so I'm not going to click on
it sorry
it may be completely legitimate but I
don't want it like crash anything 11,000
922 ok nice really going up now but not
far from from the ideal goal CL 15 and
then we change so 11 922 and we changed
to what was it t RFC - 260 and a couple
others let's let's get a thermal
measurement in here - I'm gonna do
another pass okay bench
all right let's go to some thermal
numbers in
Zeta moderator in chat is tiny earlier I
asked them to do with the a messages for
Andrew the best cameraman and 3d modeler
okay Sean slurries $2 lovely vid save
and are three twelve hundred wait
love the vids Oh have there's no space
that are sorry have a an are three
twelve hundred what would you recommend
for up for upgrades if you want to stick
with your platform if it's good enough
you could do like an r5 2600 or
something that's pretty good upgrade
that's a big one and it's somewhat
generational just makes your motherboard
is is good enough for it in the VR I'm
Department Mustangs bi mát $5 Western
Digital Forte right blue fared far
better against the against the Glock at
nineteen then the one terabyte did
bullet-resistant case in the works still
waiting for my 9900 K&amp;amp;R I made Asus
eleven code yes the the hard drive back
there the blue label one if it's visible
is a from Mustangs by Matt sent it into
our P o box and I'm not super visible
because the radiator and it has a bullet
wound it it's it's very very sharp but
it's got a good bullet wound in it score
eleven thousand nine seventeen so it's
about what should be and then the
thermals this time is what we cared
about Wow we're not breaching seventy
seventy-five I want core that's really
good actually this cooler setup is
pretty impressive
hey question mark
I am typing in an email address I have
the letter A on the keyboard but how do
I get the circle around it okay
fire on a wire or $2 what cpu are you
using here's $2 for cat treats it's more
like snowflake will be more like here's
30 cents for human treats she actually
handles all of the finances for the
channel it is a 99 8 exe to answer the
question okay so we're looking pretty
good finally but I'm also out of room on
things I can do so I don't know I don't
have much else like to do here you try
for 14 see how 14 but I'm not sure
that's gonna work can pull back some of
the timings a little bit yeah I don't
know I think at this point I'm not gonna
get like another 500 points out of
memory so it would have to be core or
something and I don't know that we're
really gonna get it there either
Oh
5850 okay let's do like 1.35 let's see
if that trips
OCP or something
mm okay
dan negara 279 Canadian thank you didn't
realize this is live until tipo hos
Joshua Bell $2 and she needs a computer
parts store like micro Center yeah I
mean it'd be nice if a lot of states on
a computer parts store but we had a Tom
POS a and Tiger Direct tigerdirect was
awful compusa was purchased by Tiger
Direct if I remember correctly and
therefore became an awful hideki's
Setsuko $5.00 thank you I know it
scrolled up always appreciate something
not always your vids and how you keep it
real with the community question though
I have a 79 80 XE that's convenient four
point six and three thirty six hundred
megahertz ram with two sli 20 ATT eyes
bottleneck it depends on the graphics
settings in the resolution if you're at
like 4 K we have testing actually we've
got a test for SLI 28 et eyes and on a
980 86 K so a lot of games are frequency
dependent so in 8086 K is gonna be
faster than a semi 980 XE e or as fast
as one depending on the game it's just
because they like frequency more than
cores most the time so you can look up
those numbers and more or less
extrapolate at what point you'll be
limited if you're pushing high enough
resolution high enough settings
especially with the way SLI doesn't
scale sometimes then I don't think
you're like me bottleneck too hard if
you are at all I just depends on the
game but look up the sli benchmarks we
did and almost
that's actually really good for five
gigahertz on four cores that's pretty
damn good
Mustangs bi mát $5 nuclear bombs dropped
were called fat man and little boy I
guess this is in response to the fat boy
wasn't the new can fall out fat boy
though Dan Nagar
279 will you ever OC a Mac nope I don't
even know how to use one I get I get
stressed every time I try I have to use
an Apple product can't figure out how to
click on things particularly the
right-click
that's a terrible experience I wouldn't
recommend it hahaha tech works $2.00 x4
99 more em ATX motherboards for thread
refer don't know I'm not sure what the
current road map is for thread river
Bradley from Anchorage wow that's that's
pretty cool that's going a long way
picked up two of the beer glasses Thank
You Bradley and then we got one from
Kyle and Florida picked up some extra
parts got a grounding cable and a wrist
wrist strap yes dearest strap not to be
confused with the verge to Live Strong
written LIVESTRONG strap one point three
six five volts now so kind of pushing it
but we had a lot of thermal room a
little bit ago
I'd like to try and cap this in the next
20 minutes is possible with the
overclocked dialing and now about as
tight as it can go other than that last
few cores Mustaine's why Matt plans to
assemble the card the guy from strange
parts could help that would blend both
sides of the audience I don't which card
oh the MSI card no no current plans I
sourcing a GPO to be pretty hard for
that we'd have like desolder one or
something Dixon software solutions do
you have any info you can share about
Arctic sound no I do not tough biker
favorite craft beer do not have one
sorry ask Paul Joe zebra $2 y'all
looking for a French writer on your team
not presently not presently expanding
who is in France chips and bits maybe
chips and bits and there's some other
publication over there I forget what
they're called there come on
publications in France there for sure in
there French language
Kelly Gaynor $5 which she had the
stickers with no stick just vinyl
looking for a nice vinyl logo to stick
on the back of my Nintendo switch it has
a clear case I guess you could mmm
that'd be kind of a pain I was gonna say
I guess you could like stick it onto a
piece of paper but then you'd have to
mask it and cut everything out so yes
unfortunately we don't have that sorry
Danny Garrett tell cameraman to zoom on
your hands when you clickety click UEFI
I think we did that once already
all right temperatures are actually fine
81 83 80 88 it's a bit high on that one
but there otherwise five oh wow okay
maybe we'll actually get it twelve
thousand hundred ten damn close this is
without ice mind you it's pretty damn
good so now we're at 5.0 on four cores
and everything else is the same
have to get another 300 points which we
just got like 200 so I would need to get
like 5.1 out of a couple of these I
don't know if it's possible to do twelve
thousand four hundred it's so close
though it's very very close to where I
want it to be
nope okay
yes there we go so I wonder if I can
just boost it to fine on more cores
maybe maybe that is feasible try two
more course so that see what that does
to more ice to more ice cubes
what's one suggested two more cores 5.0
is there you go that's what we're doing
see over watch highlights 20 SEK thank
you what is your take on payload GPUs I
don't really have an opinion on them
they don't they don't sell in the US as
far as I'm aware so I've never worked
with one Mustangs bi mát $2.00 fan
meetup medium mod back maybe someday and
then medium mod matte we actually
finally got a sample and that we're
really happy with so now showing it off
yet but we do have a sample in it's good
we just need to to finalize details go
into production so really happy about
that we are finally going to have one
it's not being made yet so you know give
us a little bit more time but it's it's
looking like we're gonna get those made
by end of year or like start the
production run by end of year that is
which means they'll probably be up on
the store around CES or at probably bit
after CES something like that really
matte is two dollars what's your honest
opinion of the 2080 you're truly honest
opinion I gave that in the review my
opinion was buy a 1080i and now there's
mercy gone so if you want to needs he is
class performance he can't get a 1080i
for cheaper then I guess you have to get
a twenty eighty if you're not gonna play
anything with arty acts or you're not
gonna play anything with the arty cores
leveraged then it feels kind of wasteful
but I don't know I I wish we got more
what from r-tx than we did and didn't
use all the dice based on other stuff
that's in one game presently
by the way 42 amps for the current so if
you're wondering about power that puts
us at about 500 watts 504 watts thermal
file $5 off topic any guess if Zen to
tiara will fit in Gen 1 TR boards I
don't know I'm thinking X 499 for those
probably that's pretty pretty close to
work in more voltage so I'm not sure I
really don't know I think yeah I don't
know no no conclusion on that right now
ty Greeson $10 my most recent CPU is

Lightroom catalog 2.5 million photos
that is a lot of photos
I don't know how Lightroom does I have
to look up the performance check Puget
systems see what they say about the
performance for Lightroom we have some
Photoshop tested that's helpful to you
but uh by if you have that many photos
and you're that serious about
photography look in the benchmarks for
it because that sounds like that's the
only thing that's gonna matter is how
well they perform in that puget should
have some some benchmarks we have some
Photoshop though astral flow $2.00
behold Tech Jesus turning ice into
stable oh yes and so was so it was told
Kristen Keller on $2 memory OC will work
just set to 2 volts not going to happen
on this board unfortunately Sean Collins
$2 ice cream tubs and freezing at large
blocks of ice we we will just we'll do a
chest device at some point with this set
up not sure one pow
so as 1.38 going to be enough to
stabilize I really want the last few
points here my stains why I'm at five
guys do you like Star Trek props I have
a mark 10 tricorder model with working
lights and screens I'd like to Senshi
live long and prosper that's pretty cool
I do I have some I have some old
tricorder and phaser model from I think
modeled after the original series that
are pretty cool they do also work in
lights and screens I don't know if it's
the same one we see no it is not the
same one I mean hey if you don't have
any personal attachment to it I'll
gladly find somewhere to put it in the
set we've got the P o box listed on the
last fan mail stream target very $5 for
the next electrical fire that you have
Thanks
really appreciate it bazinga $5.00 they
now have RGB chopsticks will the madness
ever stop have you seen this I'm afraid
you're serious they exist John Donne two
dollars buy a used a $200 car and tap
into the radiator probably be cheaper
than some of the liquid cooling parts
that we are using on this thing got a
store order from Gopal apologies for the
pronunciation and the United Kingdom
picked up an autographed mod Matt thank
you an anniversary mug and then two of
the beer glasses thank you very much for
your tremendous support we appreciate it
of course and this is passing so it did
it the one point three eight volts it
did it it's really good 5.0 now I'm sick
scores one point three eight volts up
from like one point three five I think
12,000 138 it's not even an improvement
it's not really okay I think that's
gonna be about the limit then maybe with
CL 14 or something I process lasso it I
don't know three other points kind of
lots to try and claw back and I think we
got to save something for ice but this
is getting extremely far fruit first
thing we're using for just the radiator
without any exotic cooling so the fact
that it's getting this far with that
setup that you're looking at right now
tells me that we have a lot more
Headroom in this thing if we put it
under just normal ice okay so let's do
this I'm gonna save this profile and c99
ATX eastream mora and then what I'm
gonna do is while I well I go through
last few super chats you can check out
OCC robot see how that works
got it well thanks so this is called OC
robot I've never used it before and it's
an EVGA Otto overclocking tool we're
gonna see what it lands at versus what I
landed at and I'm gonna do super chats
while that's going so we had Doug Alyssa
m-files I just don't really have
anything to ask just want to support the
channel well thank you
if it is is of great support and I'm
hungry so I'll use your $5 on some food
this is this is some name but it was a
donation and I guess it's not bad enough
to not read five dollars from grease
nipples
you didn't hand she'll after that one
opinion on the course sir 600 qks
Coursera 600 Q I don't all right I
remember this one I have to look up a
600 see and see what was that unlike I
mean it it looks awfully worn I don't
know I haven't tested it personally
I've worked with the the chassis before
I'm a different case and the build
quality is high but you might need some
help with the the thermals when we see a
28 CI Strix review probably soon I guess
when I'm done with all the 28 ET i
failure testing so that's good I wasn't
done is that it so it so we just spent a
couple hours getting to four point four
sorry
getting to 5.0 gigahertz on six cores
four point nine on the rest at one point
three eight volts and this thing that
four point four gigahertz at one point
two eight volts
it's basically running like a prime work
thought I guess maybe like FFT is or
something four point four holds on this
thing though at like 1.15 maybe one
point one eight so that's that's awfully
aggressive that is is extremely
aggressive well our our overclock I will
say is better so you're wondering man
versus machine I think I think we win
this time let's let's give it one more
go while I do a few more so that's just
if you're just turning in I already did
the manual overclock we're just kind of
seeing what the auto overclock will
achieve if I let it do its own thing
Danna Goethe OC the UEFI please t-zone I
thank you no way to do that
unfortunately clinseq earn $5 following
along in my following along on my semi
truck at a rest area in the middle of
nowhere have my 8700 K at 5.4 gigahertz
all core won't hook four volts and 47
degrees Celsius you don't have to show
off that you can overclock that well
while you're driving
I mean it's impressive but you can only
go so far
I found four is really good though
jus bottom two dollars lower build
quality for steel I would expect higher
is that in reference 956 what is that in
reference to I was probably talking
about cases at that point maybe if I was
talking about cases at that point then
the that I don't think I was talking
about yeah
aluminum cases are typically accompanied
by a higher build quality just because
the tremendous expense the material to
begin with and then you have a bit
better engineering going into it so that
is not a great let's just let's just do
it let's so we've got our score recorded
let's do EVGA version of the overclocked
and run it and we do it we just do man
vs. machine right now I clearly don't
really lost but I'm curious by how how
much it loses in times by extreme day to
file two dollars Google tipos Miam site
called Know Your Meme no thanks I don't
know your meme is thank you very much
great and visit for two dollars graphics
card silhouette magnetic screw tray baby
bent or win $20 Canadian thank you Steve
can you give up the software used to
change Seaview multiplier on epic Super
Micro board I don't have it ok 8 there
Barry yeah I don't have it sorry that's
a that's a Roman thing you'll have to
beg him for it I doubt he's gonna
distribute it I think I know what he did
if I remember correctly I know how he
did it but I do not have the ability to
distribute that for you
all right let's see how does how does
the auto us you do first is ours Dan
Magura 39 thank you
thoughts on building sleeper pcs with
90s beige case and a diskette I've
always thought that's kind of cool
Talia sleeper car I guess you can do you
can do some cool case mods on the old
beige cases I took a few and painted
them cut some holes in them and I was
really happy with how they turned out
after going through a couple days of
modding so it's a fun project and
there's zero risk because you're only
expense is gonna be the paint the tools
cases beige cases don't cost anything
super 20 is second second second twenty
second one dollar Australian Thank You
Phoenix 1861 499 I didn't say it earlier
so thanks for the amazing content can
you tell me where I can download more
ram i think you will have to first
download the internet and then you can
download some ram next question is from
great tube and oh yes i I knew what your
I think I've seen your name before and
I'm trying to remember you corrected me
once on how to say it I think it's great
to be an a you tiger
is that it otherwise it looks like gr 82
but now Tiger $5.00 I think that's how I
said the first time been the crap out of
my ACS prime Z 370 soccer pins any
chance you guys would want to try to fix
it to for content unfortunately no I've
I've unbent enough CPU pins in the last
couple weeks do not want to do it any
further my best suggestion to you two
things you can do a razor blade and get
it like parallel to all the pins and
just like carefully flex it back and
then another option is a fish hook is
probably the best possible tool for
unbending pins outside of a straight
really small razor
Wow impressive
can we get an F for the robot please so
if you wanted a man risk machine battle
our score was 12,000 138 and the robot
auto oh so you got 10,000 488 at a much
higher voltage than it should have
now if you don't know I mean if those
numbers don't mean much to you and
that's fair it doesn't look like a big
difference percentage-wise it's like 20
percent or something but the difference
is like a couple hours of work manually
and the increase in difficulty is
nonlinear so getting to that 12 K is
pretty difficult
comparatively so there's there's that
okay I'm gonna read the rest of super
chats do me a favor don't send any more
because I got to catch up so I'm gonna
cut it off at 10:00 10:30 p.m. Eastern I
am cutting off super Jets that's now by
the way we got and I'm go got it all
user two dollars Christian caldron two
dollars can you stream 720p 24 FPS 60 is
too hard kill CPU no but I guess you'd
step it down to 30 I guess you have to
go maybe before to eat I'm sorry Erin
tabby two-sevenths five dollars between
20 atfer MSI gaming extra 20 80 which is
better came in extra oh for sure I don't
even need to finish testing them to know
that it burns that when Internet
Protocol not going to miss an
opportunity to send in a super chat to
make me say his name it burns when I pee
$2 try Jensen's mentality believe it
just works well that's what we did and
it got us pretty far but not quite to
12,400 very good though for not ice I
will say that a couple more Cousteau
when I want to stop there couse to win
$10 thank you so I just want to say
thank you build Zoid and you for the
power play table information it helped
me tune my gigabyte Vegas 64 card with
for TCU Navi I may need to make it
enough I Nate I may need another to make
it to 2022
Oh GB Zilla it's tech a Seuss City I
don't know the last part means but glad
to hear power plate tables health you
it's really fun to do those models I
like working with the Vega cards for
that reason even though it's kind of
impractical but it's fun and I'm got it
a user again two dollars you want to two
x WD wrapped ten thousand thirty five
gigabytes use used to raid them we're
good on those we have arrived at 10k rpm
Drive in the background over there so we
are good thank you though Danna Guerra
what kind of performance would an RT
excise chip with all the CUDA V I guess
is the question
well you oh you mean without like RT
cores and stuff I don't know I'm not
positive how that would scale but I
would think instead maybe keep the same
FP use and then just make the chip
smaller and that would reduce cost
significantly and improve yields Sean
sois do dollars getting away be 350
gaming would are five 2600 work I don't
remember that motherboard it would work
I don't think it would be good you could
run it on that just don't be careful of
the overclocking okay look at you two
dollars Australian thank you my our
fight we have a lot of Australian
viewers but I guess it's the right time
for that my r5 1600 only hits four
gigahertz at one point four seven volts
did I lose that's pretty high voltage
I'm gonna say I'm to say you we're not
one of the winners of the silicon
lottery sorry Scuba Steve TX st dollars
for someone who streams and games on a
single rig at 1080p what are your
thoughts on a ninety nine hundred K
versus one of the new X YZ on X 299 then
I not heard K we did stream testing
actually and it does really well so as
soon as like rise in seven chip either
one perfectly fine 1080p gaming and
streaming no problem at all on a nine I
heard K especially 8700 Oz okay you'll
be fine xx he's completely unnecessary
for that techno creeper $10 thank you
I'm debating on a vague a 56 card for
144 Hertz
freesync or a 10
ETI for the same price what to do well
thank you for these sixes it's
competitive but 1070 tat is gonna out
class it in a lot of cases so I don't
know how much do you want free sink and
also if you're willing to play around
with a vacant 56 card and you don't care
as much about power without going to
power play the tables you can still
overclocker pretty well I get
competitive performance I don't know I
it depends on the price I guess if
they're like if they're the same price
I'm inclined to say 1070 ti for the
performance but if you really care about
non tearing and games
I guess that decides it for you without
budget and 4g zinc or something
we don't sell do chi $2 more Super chats
and yours is the last one at 10:31 p.m.
we a couple three more store orders I'll
read and then we'll close out here so I
got Nick from New York thank you picked
up the T logo shirt that's the
anniversary design I'm wearing tonight
things one of those Thank You Nick now
in order from Colburn from Illinois
picked up the tear down crystal statue
with the RGB base the only product we
make with the RGB thank you and then
ever gonna in Israel picked up two of
the cobalt glasses one of the tear down
crystals as well this is popular tonight
thank you for picking those out there we
think they're really cool and then one
of the key chains as well so that is it
we ended up at 12,000 138 which is
pretty pretty damn good I was that's
like really good for basically a 70 90
DXE without ice that's that's great I'm
pretty happy with that
it is not twelve thousand four hundred
so we fell short of where our original
CPU did a 70 90 DXE but though someone's
great to be an Auburn Tiger thank you I
thought it was Australian but that works
same thing so yeah I'm pretty happy with
Lawrence here 5.0 on six cores if you're
wandering and 5.06 core is what else
memory of 3800 we've stuck there can do
4000 tonight CL 15 might try 14 some
other day
- 6040 RFC 38 for foie and the most I
remember on top of my head but yeah I'm
pretty damn good for settings overall
it's just I mean it let's take one last
look at this they required this to do it
but it was only in the 80s for
temperature so I mean I probably could
have pushed a lot more voltage we had
the room to get a 1.4 but uh we'll save
that for another time does I think we're
just talking about like hundred point
increases at this point so yeah that's
it that's setup that's the more uh three
with four to hundreds on it and for one
40s on it and thank you all for watching
lotsa fun as always you go to store
documents access net to pick up some of
our products that you saw during the
stream patreon.com slash gamer xanaxes
if you want to see the to behind the
scenes videos we did in the last couple
of weeks and yes subscribe for more
we'll have another stream soon with the
cpu I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
