major ten ATT is for us to review and
we're introducing brand new charts that
normalize noise levels so to speak the
strength is another of the three fan
design cards supported by two large
aluminum fin stacks that are split by
six heat pipes the cooler doesn't go as
crazy with engineering as EVGA ACX
design but as we learn in this review it
does just fine with what asus has laid
out on the table before that this
content is brought to you by custom
backplate makers at v1 tech comm v1 Tech
builds GP back plates to order with
their online customization tool making
it easy to theme upcoming PC builds that
plates cost $25 and up and are installed
via magnets and can be seen in some
shots of the cards reviewing that lately
used code gamers Nexus 5 for five
dollars off your order or click the link
below the asus strix ROG card the 1080i
right here is one of the last ones we're
looking at anytime soon from the 1080i
family this is among the highest end
1080p eyes we've looked at alongside the
FTW three from EVGA both of those are
$780 so they compete directly with each
other and they're also both three fan
coolers with the exception being really
just the expansion slot requirement asus
is card is clocked at 1708 megahertz
boost when OC mode is used or 1683
megahertz boost when game mode is used
but because of how boost 3.0 works that
doesn't really mean a whole lot it'll
just kind of do whatever it feels like
based on thermal and power budget so
ultimately what we've learned with all
these cards as we've known for a while
now with Pascal is that they perform
pretty much identically ultimately it's
still a gtx 1080i under the hood
regardless of what's going on with the
PCB in the cooler that means that we
really care about thermals and about
noise so we've introduced a new chart
that sort of normalizes for a 40 DBA
output that'll be pretty fun to look at
and there will be no gaming results in
this one you can check the article below
if you really want the hose but they're
basically the same as every other 1080
TI that we've reviewed aside from maybe
the EFI version where
it gets a bit hot because of the cooler
design so this one is a tricks card it's
got a backplate it's got three pen
cooler will go over in a second one
final thing to point out before getting
to the cooler the GeForce GTX branding
on this one is the smallest out of all
the ones we've seen so far and there's a
reason for that and videos requiring the
words GeForce GTX to appear on the 1080p
eyes as far as we know for this round of
cards and Asus has dealt with that in a
clever way they put a sticker on it that
says 1080i you can peel it off if you
want to
so we're chatting that out I guess
because they're the only ones who
figured it out they you too strict
cooler is fairly straightforward the
base plate covers only key areas like
the vram with the right half of the
cooler taking care of the vrm components
directly base plate is secured by
several screws on the top side of the
PCB rather than using screws only in the
back half of the card like most vendors
do six total heat pipes are in the
cooler each six millimeters in diameter
and route through both halves of the
heat sink straight fins are used in the
heatsink with no fancy l-shaped fins
like in my eye CX design and those fins
make contact me if they're all bad to
the core component town misconception is
that this doesn't provide enough surface
area for contact but we've proven before
that given a straight fin contact is a
significant improvement over no contact
as for the PCB Asus uses the same
voltage controller as Nvidia's founders
Edition cars is driving a double v phase
BRM for an effective 10 videos design
using international rectifier 3 5 v 60
amp power stages and for other small
notes on the board it's got two fan
headers on the far right side along with
an RGB header naturally I will allow you
to sync with other RGB ACS type devices
so diving straight into this one the
testing methodology as always will be
linked in the description below we
define how we use or how we obtain
measurements of the power components of
the vram components because this doesn't
have sensors like the IC X cards do so
we do it with our own hardware our own
measurement devices that's all down
there Gaming results will be in the
article overclocking although unexcited
across all these cards so far will also
be in the article but really just I want
to drive home the focus is on thermals
and no
waise once you get to this level of card
there's not a whole lot of difference in
gaming we're talking a couple percentage
points and a lot of the time even that
is kind of mixed we can't really
confidently state ones better than the
other
unless it's a large enough gap because
the difference in just chip to chip
quality from the fact from Nvidia
directly to these board partners is
enough where I could test 10 of these
cards and they would have a spread of a
couple of percent so not really too much
exciting in the gaming Department they
all perform like a 1080p high is the
basics of it our first chart is a simple
one we're plotting temperature and
frequency under a power virus scenario
here which helps better understand
thermal performance fan performance and
frequency performance under vrm torture
scenario this means that we're also not
maximizing the clock so it's been
enumerated in a different way and gaming
scenarios you get a higher clock with
lower power draw as the GPU approaches
55 to 60 Celsius the stock profile
dictates that the fan kicks in at that
point and starts ramping up to match
temperature GPU frequency fluctuates
more heavily with this card done with
the FT w3 and we can kind of slide that
chart onto the screen as well we saw a
frequency range of approximately 62 mega
Hertz on the FT w3 and range about 152
mega Hertz on the Strix range meaning
the actual definition as in top to
bottom range of fluctuation some of this
can be credited to chip to chip
manufacturing tolerances and variants
you don't have a large enough sample
size of these Strix to be sure but both
FTW three is performed the same way
regardless the cards temperature target
seems to be 65 Celsius at which point
the fans are spending at 1,400 rpm on
our bench well I get fixed noise
temperature performance in a bit moving
on our next chart shows individual
component temperatures just for the
1080i Strix card when under Auto cooling
conditions we measure the power
components around the center of the vrm
as that's the hottest location the
MOSFET temperature readings spits out at
around 68 to 69 Celsius which is well
within any reasonable mosfet spec most
pets can take 125 C and beyond so this
one's really no problem at all so far
we're cooler than the gigabyte extreme
power components vram is a somewhat warm
on the asus strix comparatively but
still well within spec looking at 85 to
87
Salty's for the hottest fear and module
sandwiched between the GPU and the
capacitor bank for the BRM let's move on
to some comparative benchmarks this
first chart shows GPU diode and the
power component temperatures with Auto
settings we'll look at fixed 40 DB a
test next
the ACS 1080i ROG Strix card targets of
65 Celsius GP diode temperature putting
it nearly equal with the EVGA FTW 366
Celsius targets and cooler than the SC 2
cooler than the gigabyte extreme by a
considerable 7 C and cooler than the
gaming X by a few degrees as well we can
have power component temperatures the
EVGA FTW 3 still reigns can in this
department entirely thanks with
overbuilt heatsink CRM and asynchronous
fans with asus landing in middle of the
pack
the only real takeaway here is that
gigabytes card is the least impressive
when looking at out of box thermals and
the cooler happens to be the biggest so
here's the new 40 DB a test coming up in
a moment quick disclaimer though a lot
of people requested this thank you for
the suggestion it was a great idea there
are some challenges with this testing
though which is why it takes a while to
implement one of those is specific to
EVGA because the other board partners
aren't doing this asynchronous fan thing
yet at least not in any serious capacity
so we have to figure out with Eva J's
cards how do we achieve 40 decibels of
output because we can control all three
fans the card will sort of auto control
to a point of offsetting the power and
the memory fans by maybe 1 to 200 rpm
meaning that they are 1 to 200 rpm
different from the GPU fan rpm we ended
up sticking with that sort of proportion
where we offset the GPU power and memory
fans by an equivalent amount to what
EVGA was doing stock out of the box that
doesn't mean it's the best configuration
though EVGA is out of box config is
pretty aggressive it's a bit louder when
it's left alone and it doesn't need to
be so you could really play around with
the same for a long time and find the
exact perfect mixture of fan speed on
all three fans to get 40 DBA and good
cooling it's not that easy to do
unfortunately so keep that in mind
EVGA is performance will depend
very heavily on how you configure the
three fans I think we did what we did we
did a 54% on the GPU and 40 on the power
in the memory but if you go up more on
the memory lower on the power meet in
the middle on the GPU then you might end
up with better performance than we're
seeing in terms of temperatures just
there's a whole lot of stuff to play
with but the other cards are pretty easy
find the decibel output set the fans of
that percentage and let it go gigabytes
still being added to this one we only
have the GPU temperatures right now but
the other three have all been run
through with fan speeds configured to a
fixed 40 DBA output we finally start to
see some distinction between these a IV
partner cards we configured EVGA again
to run at 54 40 and 40 percent for the
three fan speeds as GPM in order the
other cards are all or nothing for their
fan speeds making them easier asus is
impressive here rog Strix runs cooler on
the GPU producing a 31.4 selfies delta T
over ambient value which means we've
adjusted it for ambient and that's a
full 6 LT is cooler than the next
closest card to the gaming X which has
generally been one of the quietest cards
on our bench that card has now been
dethroned by asus and next the gigabyte
extreme horas which doesn't look all
that great when tested at stock speeds
is running 40.7 salvias delta T with the
FTW three last but again the most
difficult to configure so you can get
these temperatures lower and sacrifice
other component temperatures if so
desired just a matter of how many hours
you want to put into it
power temperature isn't measured on the
middle MOSFET off set up from the middle
and the Strix again at the lead with a
35.4 Celsius Delta team measurement EVGA
FTW three is the number one coolest for
VR on components when all cards are
configured Auto but loses ground to aces
here when we configured a 40 DBA output
that's a 40.4 sells these delta T value
with Amazigh trailing at 40 2.1 celsius
delta t finally the vram module between
the GPU and the vrm which tends to be
the hottest
measures at fifty two point seven sells
is delta T on the Strix card where EVGA
runs 50 6.6 temperature on the vram
module trailed by msi at 57.9 Celsius
with these noise equalized tests ACS is
the clear winner here they have
best temperatures all around the board
the only MSI we know where they're
performing pretty easy to test gigabyte
we know their GP temperature need to run
the fat's in the VM EVGA is hard because
again any one of those three
temperatures you could bring way down at
the cost of pushing some of the other
ones up a little bit so just depends on
how much you're willing to trade power
could go up GPU can go down and vice
versa but that's a start to our new
charts it's pretty cool stuff I'm
excited to add more to it these are the
kind of charts that really only work
when we have a whole bunch of one type
of GPU like GP 102 or what-have-you
because of the kind of chart it is I
mean ultimately you're comparing cooler
is not GPUs we might try and play around
with it for other things but this was
the debut so let us know what you think
let's look at our older noise chart
under idle conditions the strict makes
no noise and we see our noise floor of
the test environment the strict cards
fans spin down one under no-load as do
the fans of the SCT FTW 3s by OS 2 game
and X and extreme horas one left to
their own devices Auto the Strix is the
second quietest card with the gaming X
holding on to the quietest rank as it
has done the entire time of well
actually all of our recent ZP is has the
Strix pushes about 38.6 DBA went under
auto fan curves it so it's spinning
slower than in the aforementioned at 40
DB a test to this plant at roughly tied
with the extreme horas and perceptibly
quieter than the FTW three-card with
Auto fan speeds so you carry the EVGA
though the FTW three is a dual slot card
not many others can say that at this
time at 50% fan speeds at 1080 I extreme
and gaming X cards are roughly tied as
are these Trix FTW 3 and F ecards of the
gap between all three of the ladder are
noticeably louder than the extreme and
gaming X that c2 is more than 2 times
louder than the gaming X and perceived
noise output as this is a logarithmic
scale this number isn't all that useful
though since you're either running cool
is under Auto conditions or under fixed
fan curves which are new for DBA test
sort of accounts for we also have a
chart with noise at 100% just a pride
perspective your fans will never
realistically reach a 100% fan speed as
the cards would rather sacrifice
frequency then push decibel levels as
high that's true for all of these at
100% speed zone on the less the strakes
is among the
as three cards on the bench including
sc2 and heightened XP all this really
means that Asus allows its fans to go
faster than others that combined with
acoustics of the cooling solution let's
flashback to that auto test for noise if
you're using the card out of box with no
changes whatsoever this is the test that
you should pay attention to and the
acoustics you should expect it has one
of the most efficient coolers we tested
thus far showing by thermal performance
overall and by the 40 DB a normalized
charts but it does have quite a bit of
competition particularly from MSI and
the gaming X which is a tall cooler with
big fans again like the FT w3 it's hard
to justify a 780 dollar purchase for one
of these types of cards if it doesn't
offer anything you care about and
ultimately gaming performance for all of
them pretty much the same so if that's
all you care about as long as it's not a
thermally limited card like an Effie
card or similar design then you can
really buy any of the ones we've
reviewed so far when it comes to thermal
the noise that's where there's
distinction between the devices so not
too much to be fair they're all fairly
close when Auto once we start
controlling for 40 DBA this one's
looking pretty damn good but it's also
again $780 and you could tune the FTW
three to your heart's content if you
wanted to spend all day on it
it's got all those sensors on it it's
definitely an enthusiast toy also 782
colours so we look to the won the $50
bracket 750 points and the SC to the
gaming acts the extremists are all
around that point the extreme Horace as
we review more of these cards looks like
the less favorable purchase to be nice
to it the gaming acts and the sc2
however are much more competitive
directly with each other and with the
other devices there's 750 otters on 780
and they will make the majority of users
perfectly happy as would to be fair at
720 dollar version of the 1080i once you
get the 700 you have to be careful what
you buy there is some pretty bad card to
that price point we might have content
on them I'm not really sure the FE card
has a great PCB but it's not beat cooler
so unless you're going to mod it it's
really not ideal for their own
performance which restricts your
frequency performance
restricts your frame rate something like
6 to 11
send the pan down the game so really
what you're looking at from our tests is
if you do not care specifically about
something this offers by a $750 card 720
to 750 and call it a day and be happy
with it if you like the noise
performance we're seeing out of this
particularly at the 40 DB a point it's a
pretty damn competitive by the FT w3 is
less easy to justify at this point than
it was even before and the sc2 still is
a strong contender at $750 and as one of
our co2 is just because it's got all
those icx sensors on it which frankly
are a lot of fun to play with even
though they might not provide a whole
lot of functional value to you so it's
kind of a neat thing to look at which I
spending that much money that's half the
battle anyway so that's the Strix it's a
good card just again 30 bucks more do
you want to spend it not everyone needs
to most people in fact don't need to so
it keep that in mind thank you for
watching as always you can go to
patreon.com/scishow to be like to get a
preview of the new types of charts I
posted the teaser of this one before we
went live with the review and you can go
to store that gamers Nexus about not to
grab shirts we have some try blends that
are almost out of stock thanks to all of
you reviews that gaming sexist on net
