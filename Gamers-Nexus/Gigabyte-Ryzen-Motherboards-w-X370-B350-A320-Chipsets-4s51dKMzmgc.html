CES 2017 looking at some of the
motherboards for the rise in CPUs that
are forthcoming right now we're looking
at gigabyte we already talked about the
MSI motherboards and have a video on
that if you're curious for more what are
you walking through some of these some
of the PCI configurations on each of
these boards and get a better idea of
the lane available availability and
things like that before getting to that
this coverage is brought to you by cyber
power and there's cyber XL gaming PC
will have a link in the description
below if you're curious and want to
learn more about their invertible
motherboard layout let's start with this
one this is the gaming the k5 this is an
X 370 board as many of you likely know
at this point the AMD chip sets for
Rison are comprised of a x37 yet sort of
the high end and then you go down to be
350 more mid-range and a 320 at the
bottom end which is probably going to be
the least popular among our type of
audience there's sort of a side chipset
called X 300 and this one is it's a
little bit different we might talk about
it more later but that's targeted more
specifically for mini ITX motherboard so
if you were an FX user or wanted to be
an FX user and couldn't find a mini ITX
motherboard this is supposed to solve
that problem where the X 300 chipset is
basically the size of a pinky net it's
very small and all of the i/o is
transacted through the CPU using the CPU
lanes rather than relying on any chipset
lanes with that said the first board the
gaming k5 I don't have the official
specs with me but it looks to be
something like a seven or eight phase
layout it might be a six plus one or
something like that will talk to
gigabyte more about this the memory and
the PCIe slots have what most boards
seem to be doing now which is the sort
of metal plate reinforcements and that
doesn't have four there's different
reasons to use it on the memory verses
on the PCIe on memory normally it's for
something like additional ground points
on PCIe it's for additional strength for
people who rip it out of the socket or
something but get into the board the
x-37 a chip site will have a chart we
put on the screen with some of the base
i/o that you
expect out of each chipset that covers
USB 3 SATA Express things like that and
before getting kind of cynical about
SATA Express there's actually a reason
to have it you can peel off those lands
and use them for something else
just because SATA Express is driven on
PCIe and that bus so for the rest of the
board pretty straightforward it's got a
by 16 a by 8 and a by 4 slot so these
three PCIe slots even though they're
full-length they are wired electrically
for 16 8 &amp;amp; 4 and then if you look really
closely above the first PCIe slot
there's a set of 4 chips which we also
showed on the back the X power titanium
from MSI those can MUX the signal for
additional video cards let's move on to
the next board this is the gigabyte X
370 gaming of 5 so no K on this one it's
basically just got the white or s
badging instead of the black or s
badging and it is otherwise functionally
mostly the same thing I suppose there's
the difference actually we look closely
at the at the choke so this might
actually be 10 total phase board so it's
got a bit a bit more going on there but
we'll have to talk down there's also a
killer Ethernet chip on there the rest
of it is gonna be elf LED RGB
differentiated as we saw with the
gigabyte board we reviewed recently
though this does have some of that as
well because the or is branding as far
as the heatsink and cooler support this
is something probably important to note
even though it's a different socket
there's more pins and am4 it's something
like 1331 pins off top my head whereas
am3+ was 900 something so the sockets
physically larger and that does mean
that there are some changes to coolers
but they're supposed to be support for
that so the cooling manufacturers are in
communication with AMD about this
they're supposed to be making at least
adapters or mounting brackets for future
CPUs have not current ones that mostly
covers that moving on to this board this
is a micro ATX port it's not many I TX
so we don't have the x300 chipset that I
mentioned it is on the a320 chipset
which is the lowest M SKU very basic
board not really worth talking about a
whole lot of it other than there's just
PCIe x16 wired for x16 it looks like and
to DIMM slots now the last board is
another it's a V 350 board this is the
game
three from gigabyte and it's more simple
looks like it's got something like seven
total phases for the vrm maybe there's
something like that and then none of the
LEDs it's gonna be your more mid-range
board probably in the 100 ish 100 130
range somewhere they're just kind of
speculating but that covers it so that's
the basics if you have if you are
curious about the previous boards we
looked at the MSI ones the link of the
description below or in the post roll
video we'll have one of those and as far
as information CPU socket should be
mostly compatible going forward the big
important thing to note is that this
will launch before March 31st have been
given that information directly I don't
know how long before but that's what we
have for a window thank you for watching
as always page on link the post all
video to help us out directly link to
the description below for more
information I'll see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
