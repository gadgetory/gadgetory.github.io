hardcore overclocking and today we're
gonna be taking a look at the Radeon
seven refunds PCB from AMD it is it's
it's very interesting it's one of the
first times I've seen a PCB and gone
like I mean there's a few other cases
where this has happened but this is like
one of the more recent ones where I've
gone like I have no idea where anything
is because of how complicated this thing
is well how many different voltage rails
are on this thing well different
regulators and rails you know you you
need different regulators for your
different rails so before that this
video is brought to you by Thermaltake
score p3 case the core p3 is one of the
most unique cases on the market it can
serve as an open-air standing chassis a
test bench in vertical or horizontal
orientation or as a wall-mounted
showcase pc the core p3 now comes with a
5 millimeter thick tempered glass panel
for its slide but keeps the front top
and back open for air the core p3 is
versatility as a display piece test
bench or standard desktop is reinforced
by its price of roughly 110 dollars on
amazon you can learn more at the link in
the description below anyway let's get
right into it and so starting off with
the largest and most important - erm on
the card the V Corps which in typical
AMD file not really so you know and in
the past with like the Vega 64 AMD set a
you know AMD had like the most powerful
consumer the are like consumer GPU vrm
right it was like on par with extreme
overclocking cards and this vrm could
have been that like in fact this vrm
could have been more powerful than what
you get on a 20 80 TI but you know that
and that basically means it isn't so
this is the the lovely V coral in this
and it is still very very powerful and
still very very efficient it's just not
as ridiculous like I'm sad that it's not
as ridiculous as it could have been okay
I'll be honest with you I really wish
that this was still this was still full
populated and also we can kind of see up
here you know in the PCV normally
there'd be a little switch thing with a
nub that sticks out in that little slot
that they have cut so yeah that is where
the bios which would have been if AMD
had bothered to include it but anyway
back to the vrm which the reasoning why
these phases are missing is actually
really really simple in typical AMD
fashion AMD has opted for some very nice
and very expensive power power company
well they're not MOSFETs their power
stages there's MOSFETs in them but you
know that goes it's significant enough
difference that I wouldn't call these
MOSFETs so they've opted for some very
very nice power stages which
historically they've really just gone
for like really nice MOSFETs and then
well actually no they did use a lot of
well yeah power stages as well so anyway
AMD likes their high-end well like you
know high-end power components so
they've gone for TDA International
rectifier or Infineon at this point TD a
two one four seven two's these are 70 M
smart power stages so at this point you
might be like oh so it's like the same
thing as the FD MF 31 70s that you find
on like in video reference cards
actually most of the r-tx 20 series well
no these are about twice as expensive as
an FD MF 31 70 these are about $4 apiece
and that's even if you're buying 50
thousand of them so basically by not
including these two phase like these
four phases right here AMD is probably
saving around $20 on the vrv core vrm
which makes sense because I mean this
card is supposed to hit a price point of
750 dollars retail and that right there
is really really expensive too so you
know it's just like well you got to
start saving cost somewhere right and
and this isn't gonna get cheaper that
that has a relatively fixed
manufacturing cost and I'm not even sure
if it's possible to manufacture HBM GP
without all of the HBM populated because
if you look at like the Titan me right
the Titan V only has three active HBM
stacks but there's four of them on the
chip so yeah that's that's one of the
reasons why I'm wondering if AMD even
has a choice about you know going for
Less HBM with this thing because it's
just like well it might cost more to
assemble than it costs to buy the actual
stacks and so the issue is that you can
only assemble it as a four stack
configuration not as a three or two
anyway and a two would probably have
bandwidth issues but anyway so you know
trying to save some money on the vrm and
then getting the really really high in
power stages now what makes these kind
of special compared to say the FDM f31
70 is that because these are you know 70
amps more power stages so that means
they have all of the usual features like
over current protection over temperature
protection built-in current monitoring
built-in temperature monitoring you know
all kinds of cool features like that
which makes them a smart power stage but
because these are also made by
international rectifier and extremely
expensive they also come with features
like a tolerant like they can run at
switching frequencies as high as one
point 5 mega Hertz whereas the FD MF 31
70s which and video likes to use those
go only up to one mega Hertz
not that that's a particularly useful
difference because most of the time you
will never run your voltage regulator at
that kind of frequency it ruins your
efficiency but these also include
something called body braking mode which
is a standard feature for international
rectifier power stages which essentially
is used for load transients on load
release which basically minimizes your
voltage overshoot on load release which
is a really really cool feature but yeah
so that's something the FT MF 31
seventies just straight up don't have so
essentially what that allows these the
the body braking what that does with
these power stages is essentially if you
go from a high current draw to a low
current draw condition you can stop
using the low side MOSFET on these and
that forces all of the currents to give
flow through the body diode and the body
diode has a bunch of voltage drop so you
can very quick
we burn off the energy stored in your
inductor without getting the usual
without getting as high of a voltage
spike as you normally get when when you
go from a high current draw scenario to
a low current draw scenario so that's a
pretty cool feature that the these have
and that also adds to their cost and
they're also ever so slightly more
efficient than the FDM f31 70s for a
comparison because both are expect for
like Intel CPUs at 1.8 volts the TDA 1.8
volts output the TDA to 147 - pushing 40
amps only dissipates about 5 watts with
600 kilohertz switching frequency
whereas the FDM f31 70 would dissipate
about 5.6 watts with 500 kilohertz
switching frequency and then if you go
all the way up to 60 amps output on
these on a single one of these these
would produce only about 10 watts of
heat whereas the FDM f31 70s produce
about 12 watts of heat so these are
slightly more efficient they have
slightly higher switching frequency
capabilities and they have body braking
mode and that's why they're twice the
price so yeah that that's kind of you
know am V for you they really like their
high end power components unfortunately
they can't actually have that many of
them on this card I'm like they should
do like a special extreme overclocking
edition of this card with with a bios
switch and voltage controls and no power
limit and and no boost algorithm that
would be great and fully populate the VR
I'm in charge a thousand bucks and I'll
buy it I'd actually probably buy that
anyway so you know that's our power
stage here the the phase count for the
vcore PRM is one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten phases and this is
an actual 10 phase configuration it's
not a true 10 phase because AMD is still
going with their ever-so-popular well
with their favorite voltage regulator
I'm pretty sure that is built just for
the them the IR three five two one seven
which we've already seen on like Vega 64
and Vega frontier Edition this thing
goes up to eight phases there's no
datasheet on for this thing at all but
one would assume that this being a 3 5 2
200 series chip it'll go up to 2
megahertz switching frequency if you so
desire you know you wouldn't actually do
that because it'll ruin your vrm
efficiency but you can and yeah it goes
up to 8 phases and here it's actually
running in a 5 plus 1 phase
configuration if the if the vrm was
fully populated it would have been
running in a 7 plus 1 but as it is it's
only configured for a 5 plus 1 and then
it is doubled into the 10 phase by these
chips right around here so and those are
of course because this is an
international rectifier the RM design
these are of course ir35 99s which are
like the their main feature is that they
can go quadruple or they can run as a
quadruple ER so you can go from like 5
phases to 20 with these but here they
are only used in doubling mode and the
downsides of them being quadruple errs
is that they do the most basic of
doubling possible where they essentially
take the PWM signal and just put it a
split it between the 2 phases which
basically means there's no current
balancing and as far as the voltage
controllers can concern this is a five
phase but the 3599 does have the
advantage that like you still get the
reduced output ripple because your
phases are all interleaving right so you
do have 10 different PWM signals on the
actual power stages themselves so you
get the reduced output ripple you get
the reduced input Ripple but you just
don't get any like this since you like
current balancing your vrm efficiency
isn't quite as high as it could be if it
was perfectly current balanced and all
that kind of thing but uh you know that
because as it is the the like the ir35
to 1/7 is doing all of the current
balancing and it does it in groups of
two so it'll like take this block right
here which is two phases and it'll
current block balance that against this
against this and against this it will
not actually current balance the two
phases in each of the like the this
individual phases within those blocks
will not be current balanced at all but
uh yeah still like as far as well like
VRMs go that this is definitely not a
design it's just like it's the
limitations of going with international
rectifier and the only company doing
like fully current balanced voltage
current balanced doublers are inter cell
and they well they're really expensive
to run so they're they're like even more
expensive than than the than
international rectifier parts because
you'd be like Intersil I'm not sure
interests I'll even makes a 70 amps
smart power well they do make a 60 but
I'm not sure they make a 70 amps more
power stage yeah and the the doublers
that they like the current balanced
doublers from intersil i think are like
1.5 dollars a piece in bulk at least
last time I checked them so you know
yeah not really a great option in terms
of maintaining low you know keeping your
costs low know that International
rectifier is much better but it's it's
not quite as bad because at least the
doublers are like half a dollar each
instead of one and a half anyway so that
that's a recurve erm another interesting
thing to note is that we almost have a
full you you know AMD was the first to
come out with the l-shaped erm and video
kinda in my opinion one-up them with the
double I configuration where you have
one row of phases on one side of the via
via of the core and then the other row
of phases on the other side of the core
and essentially what that means is when
you are pushing power to the GPU core
what happens with a standard sort of erm
layout where you just have one row of
phases on one side of the core as you
push current into the core you get a
voltage drop across the power plane and
so essentially this side of the core has
less core voltage than this side and you
can actually check that on GPUs while
they're running if you measure the
bypass capacitors on the back of the GPU
core 4v core the ones furthest away from
the vrm will tend to have a couple
millivolts less voltage than the ones
nearer sometimes as much as like tens of
millions so yeah and on like a Vega with
the l-shaped vrm you could actually
measure like in this corner you'd be
measuring like 1.2
and if you measure it in this corner
you'd measure 1.17 right so you'd have a
difference like that so this vrm I mean
it's normal full you if they went for
the full you then you'd have like this
point right here that would be your
lowest voltage but with this
configuration that point will very
likely be actually we should go like
that that point will very likely be
right here again but it's um it'll be
interesting to see how much of a
difference it would be from like here
right like across there and what what
kind of voltage difference you'd have it
should be very low because this is
getting very close to almost like a full
surround I wonder if we'll ever see an O
but anyway so that's kind of interesting
that Amity has the vrm laid out like
that and that does mean that you get a
bit more uniform voltage on the GPU core
which in theory means you'd have a bit
better clock margin for any given
voltage because ultimately your lowest
voltage is also gonna affect like your
lowest voltage going into the core is
gonna obviously limit your maximum
frequency so anyway and it does mean you
also have a bit better efficiency
because there's a lot less voltage drop
across the power plane but that's really
a minor thing anyway so that's the the
vcore vrm sort of you know not mention
not taking a look at the power
efficiency so let's take a look at the
power efficiency the TDA 200 472 s make
this VRM ridiculously power efficient
and for my convenience they're also
SPECT at 1.2 volts so 1.2 volts out
output 400 kilohertz switching frequency
and a drive voltage of 5 volts which is
standard which also means we have a 5
volts regulator somewhere on the card
I'm not sure where there's because we
have like regulators up there up here up
here this thing that thing and we'll get
to those eventually but those like then
we have another regulator down here
these are like the minor ones there's
also like I assume this is a regulator
but I'm that might be 5 volts
fortunately like there's rails
everywhere on this card so and I'm not
sure which one specifically as 5 volts
but there is a 5 volts RL somewhere on
the rail because these I mean some
on the card because these run off the
five volts being a smart power stage
that's pretty standard for them now then
they are expected at 1.2 volts 400
kilohertz from my convenience and for
the card does not run on 1.2 volts right
it's seven nanometer it runs on a lot
less voltage than that anyway so 200
amps output at 1.2 volts you're gonna be
looking at about 15 watts of heat
dissipation on this vrm which is crazy
efficient like that is really really
really great efficiency right there it's
just about 94% efficiency actually it's
not exactly 15 okay because if you
actually go you know if you go without
15 watts figure at 1.2 volts 200 amps
you're gonna get like 94.1 percent
efficiency yeah that doesn't work out
it's like fifteen point five or
something because it's just barely under
94% efficient this vrm is at 1.2 volts
output 200 amps so yeah but about 15
watts so you know like you don't you
shouldn't need a heatsink wholeness you
really shouldn't
if you're only pushing 200 amps now
going up to 300 amps output this vrm is
gonna still only produce about 20 watts
of heat which is again like there's a
crazy efficiency like these td8 to one
for actually most of these 70 amps more
power stages are really good in terms of
their efficiency but the TDA 2 1 4 7 2's
are a bit better than most and then
going up actually wait now I misread my
notes
that's only 250 Watts 258 and still 20
Watts well yeah that's still a really
great efficiency right there going up
further to 300 amps output you're gonna
be looking at about 25 watts of
efficient like heat dissipation which
again like I mean I don't need to tell I
like the efficiency is just out like up
there and I'm really sad that they
didn't go for a 14 face like the
seriously it would have been insane how
efficient this vrm would have ended up
being but anyway going from 300 amps to
400 amps so I think ultimately like
stock the card runs in that 200 to 250
amp range 300 amps up you're gonna be
looking at overclocking and the higher
the current you're going
you know looking at like extreme cooling
methods to hit the higher currency if
the card even scales to that kind of
current level anyway about 400 amps
you're gonna be looking at about only 40
watts of heat and 500 amps you're gonna
be looking at about 60 watts of heat so
at this point the the vrm starts
actually you know like we got a pretty
major increase in heat dissipation going
from 400 amps to 500 amps and then 600
actually my notes don't have 600 amps
which is also like unfortunately the
datasheet ends at 60 amps anyway so we
couldn't really go past that and I doubt
anybody's gonna run these on ln2 anyway
so yeah and if they do I'm not sure if
they'll even scale to 500 amps all right
we still like well like we still have to
see about that but still for normal
usage this vrm is really really
efficient so that's great
for extreme overclocking who knows like
it really depends if the card even needs
that much current win on ln2 and I don't
know that we'll find out because I'm not
buying one of these I don't plan to and
I it's not competitive with a twenty
atti so I really doubt anybody's gonna
seriously bench one of these so yeah
that kind of sucks because this is a
really nice VRM and it would be even
nicer if it had all fourteen phases but
anyway moving on to the other main prm's
we're not gonna talk about the other
like circled regulators because quite
frankly I don't know which one of them
is which and there's a bunch of them
that have to be on the card so we have
like 1.8 volts for the HBM there's gonna
be a pecs rail so well there's a PCIe
rail there's a display drive rail PCIe
which usually those two are combined so
PCI in display but uh yeah oh yeah
there's also the 5 volts rail and
unfortunately there's like more
regulators on this card then I know like
common AMD voltage rails for so
evidently AMD has added a couple new
ones but I don't know what they are so
anyway moving on to the ones that I do
know what they are we have down here
HBM power which is a two-phase so that's
our HBM vrm right there one and two and
then down here we have VDD CI and VDD CI
is normally on like AMD's gddr5 based
cards is normally huge okay like if you
look at like 7-9 70s or 7-9 50s there
are multiple 7-9 70s and 7-9 50s with
like two phase VD DCI because the VD DCI
rail used to be so power-hungry and
that's the the memory controller in fact
VD DC I used to normally pull more
current than the memory itself did so
yeah that's kind of an interesting like
difference between the older cards and
the HBM cards where now with the VD DCI
rail is this cute little adorable thing
right here which is a single phase and
that is a eye are three five four zero
one power stage and that's a 20 amp part
so like that this thing you know this is
a really low current rail where
previously this thing went like that
like oh no seven nine seventy this wood
straight up blow up because if I
remember correctly seven nine 70s I had
stock average like 15 amps on that rail
so yeah interesting out of the HBM
memory controller needs so much less
power
now that the card has four HBM chips the
the HBM vrm itself has gotten a quite an
upgrade right but so the HBM erm is on
the again on the TDA two one four seven
twos and that's going to be controlled
by this chip right here which is another
three five two one seven and then we get
this VR i'm over here which is the SOC
regulator so yeah Vega has a system on a
chip portion and that's another two
phase and that's also hanging off of
this three five to one seven down here
the VDD CI I'm assuming is running off
of the three five to one seven on the
back because this one is
like that one's maxed out at seven plus
one right and so this one straight up
couldn't run a set like it can't do a
seven plus two right which you need that
plus two for the HBM and the sock rails
so this three five two one seven here is
running in two plus two configuration
for HB m and SOC both of those are again
on more TDA to on for seven to s which
is probably ridiculous overkill for both
of them because the HBM generally
doesn't pull that much power
I mean HB m the HBM power on a vega 64
was like a vega 64 has two HB m stacks
or HB m two stacks and that one like
quite frankly that vrm was a
single-phase and it wasn't good enough
for more than maybe if i remember
correctly i was a good for like 30 amps
max or something so the new HB m vr m is
actually kind of overkill and kind of an
odd decision in my opinion i do wonder
why i'm d didn't opt for like a week or
HB m vr m and then you know spend more
money on the vcore like i'd prefer that
but uh anyway here they decided that you
know they're gonna go for two like a
really really powerful HB m erm i guess
it might be for the 32 gig of re into
the card because logically the 32 gig HB
m it has more like there's more memory
chips in those stacks so they would pull
more power so i guess that's what why we
have the the two-phase HB m now whereas
previously it was like an anemic
single-phase so that's that's that's an
interesting difference but uh and
finally we have the SOC rail which is
the same as the HP m so yeah that there
is the Radeon 7 PC B it's uh you know
like it is actually more efficient than
a reference vegas 64 like even though it
has less phases the individual phases
are much better than what you got on a
Radeon Vegas it like on the Vega 64's
just because the TDA 2 1 4 7 s are
absolutely stupid in terms of their
efficiency I think these are awesome and
super expensive as a side effect but uh
the yeah so this is ultimately like even
though it's a ten phase it's actually
more efficient than the twelve phase you
got on a Vega sixty-four also because I
think thermally this vrm works out to be
less dense it should actually be less
hard to cool without a heatsink
so that's kind of fun and then for HB m
we've gotten a huge upgrade on the HB m
vr m VD d c-- eyes got a bit of an
upgrade as well previously it was a just
a minor like it was basically that that
used to be VDD CI on a Leica Vega and
then SOC has like well I don't remember
Vega I'm not sure Vega had an SOC rail I
don't think it did so that one's new and
I'm not sure how much current it needs
so that's kind of that yeah but that's
the Radeon seven mic it is very
complicated right and the layouts rather
unique and overall I'm a fan of it but
then then again it's like when have I
not been a fan of an AMD reference
design so yeah that's it so thanks for
watching like share subscribe leave any
comments questions suggestions down in
the comment section below and if you'd
like to support gamers Nexus there's a
store gamers Nexus net where you can
pick up things like the mod mat you can
see in the background shirts I think
glasses mugs and that kind of thing
and there's also the gamers Nexus
patreon and also if you'd like to check
out more content from me there's a I
have a channel called actually hardcore
overclocking where I do more PCB
breakdowns and other overclocking
related content so yeah if you'd like to
check that out that would be cool thanks
for watching and good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
