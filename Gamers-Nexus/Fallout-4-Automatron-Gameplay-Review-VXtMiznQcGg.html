week under Bethesda's newly raised
season pass pricing but is also
available individually of course the
first expansion kit is named automat Ron
and is available independently at ten
dollars or as part of that season buyin
and as with most games it's effectively
a glorified professionally crafted mod
that expands base play modestly but
doesn't go too crazy auto motor on a
dance or tubby be eg to the Commonwealth
and he's known only as the mechanist
equal parts ambiguous evil sounding and
very corny if we're honest and he is
crafting custom robots to terrorize the
countryside as would be the case it's of
course our job to destroy him it's a
wholly original storyline for the elder
or rather fallout games and by wholly
original I mean not that at all because
really it's the same stuff we see in the
Elder Scrolls same stuff we saw in
fallout 4 3 new Vegas and all the other
games that are of this ilk the DLC it
makes for more of the same side quests
and ottoman sean sets up a few new
dungeon environment and buildings robots
Raiders as always and puts a new BB EG
behind them but just because it's more
of the same doesn't mean it's bad the
story is reasonably compelling if short
and serves as a vessel for the
introduction of new robot building
mechanics for the post DLC game world
after we save a caravan from robot
onslaught and overthrow the mechanist
this is by the way a process that takes
just under three hours if reasonably
paced and if you're reading all of the
lower that's in the terminals we're then
granted access to robot schematics for
all the favorites using appropriate
perks and supplies were able to craft
robots who can function as settlers or
as companions with varying abilities and
deadliness and weapons and face lasers
and all that good stuff bugs are of
course present throughout this DLC is
Bethesda after all and they really
shouldn't be given a pass for these
especially at this point they're not too
bad this time thankfully we ran mostly
into pathfinding issues with robot
companions and issues where robots would
blow their own arms off by using weapons
too close to solid objects other than
this the new features function fairly
well and generally without bugs that
break things be
repair that said it seems very likely
that modders will recreate this
functionality in the future and make it
available through free mods so if you're
really sort of cheap and you'd rather
wait and maybe see if modders do it
differently or perhaps better you of
course support fit some stuff like that
storyline but you might get some of the
same functionality so you're looking
around at nexus mods and seeing what
pops up other than this though
everything is reasonably put together
auto mitrani is the first DLC for
Fallout 4 and it's a solid addition to
the game the storyline accompanying
atmosphere and the new functions add
some variety and offer an enjoyable I'll
be it a bit short playthrough for a new
type of dungeon the larger addition is
robot crafting which provides a lot of
options and further specialization for
how to spec out a character since now
companions are also customizable and
outside of a few minor bugs like the
pathfinding the robot crafting works
surprisingly well ultimate Ron is
certainly fun and at ten dollars it's
worth getting for die-hard fans who want
to see the extra elements and maybe the
accompanying side quests for fallout 4
but for casual players and people who'd
rather wait around a bit we would
definitely suggest considering waiting
until a sale and for the time being just
install robot home defense which is a
mod available on Nexus mod and check our
channel for a fallout for modding
overhaul video where we talk about some
other robot mods and other types of mods
that will expand the experience of
course for free so that is all for this
quick review of fallout 4 is that new
automatron dlc our sincere thanks of
