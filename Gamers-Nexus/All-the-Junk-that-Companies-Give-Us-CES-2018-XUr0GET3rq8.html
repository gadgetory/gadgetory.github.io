 at trade shows which is probably
fair because we do the same for them of
their products throughout the whole year
but what we're going to do here is go
through a bunch of the things that we
received coal some of them and see what
it is we ended up with that we didn't
necessarily want before heading home
with limited suitcase space so let's get
through it these are the media gifts
that were provided by each manufacturer
we of course appreciate the gestures but
there's nothing wrong with poking a
little fun at them either before that
this video is brought to you by EVGA and
the X 299 dark motherboard for the Intel
high-end desktop CPUs the X 299 dark is
one of the only motherboards on the
market with proper vrm cooling we've
tested this and found a significant
performance increase over those without
active cooling on the prm's this board
was used in our recent attempt to set a
top 10 record in fire strike and you can
learn more about the x-29 dark at the
link in the description below let's
start with MSI MSI sent this box of
lucky as it says here some RPC we are
gaming set nutrition facts now so let's
take a look at this I just need to get
the bloatware out of here quickly one
second it's gonna take me a while some
more bloatware I think that's most of
there some quite pop up later so three
dragons its lucky the dragon they showed
them off at Computex last year they're
very proud of lucky the dragon it's
their super hero dragon that they now
have little figurines of so good job MSI
thank you it looks looks pretty good for
a mascot product I will admit it
actually actually this is this is kind
of genuinely cool so this is a twin
frozer USB key and video did this not
long ago with their reference design and
that was pretty cool as well
so this one oh there you go see ya the
u.s. tiny USB 3 key that sockets into
the Twin Frozr cooler I actually can't
see if they have their own pads on the
VRMs on this one so that's the that's we
got some of those from our
I don't know how big those are for
storage but they're pretty cool so thank
you a Maasai we appreciate that at least
one of them we got this red hat from
pixie oh I'm just gonna that over there
iPhone iPhone exerci it's not I phone 10
I think it's iPhone X or is life on 10
tell us how you feel about patch works
okay done my phone case hey what's next
oh here you go this came from pixie oh I
don't know what this is Islands of 9 and
YN e it's a game so what I'm gonna do is
just read the game code and whoever
wants to redeem it can redeem it x g j x
j3 v eb i see a 2x6
and i don't know where you put that so
start with steam I guess so that's from
pixie Oh some kind of game and a couple
of other things this is an ro G spot
light kind of cheating because it's a
real product this is from Asus story
behind this one is it's not final so
this is 50% of the brightness the final
version supposed to be from what they
tell us but it just says Republic of
gamers I almost said the sneeze I think
to Asus this is the NZXT grid plus
version 3 NZXT also kind of cheating
here by giving us a real product but no
no we told me I can't do that again on
camera so we will cherish this and bring
it home and use it in one of our systems
this one this one will be fun to get
through airport security this is a to
say one pound tub of thermal paste that
we'll be using for a standard testing
over the next probably several years I
think we go through these actually about
we go through them pretty quickly we
went through one to two in the last year
so this is a Sutekh thermal compound and
we use it to standardize our tests
because I get a lot of it and I know it
comes from the same batch so the testing
is pretty pretty much controlled for
thermal paste so that actually it comes
out of a
a factory in China and so getting it to
the US is something of a story as well
which will say for another time
speaking of airport security this is a
bare PCB and set of colorful wires happy
saved from an overclocking company this
is overlay live I think the company is
epeak and they have some loose
affiliation indirectly with hardware
bought as well they saw us working on
our Titan V live overclocking that we
did in the live stream and I said hey
instead of showing the multimeter and
the thermocouples on camera you could
actually use our device connected to
your asus rog motherboard that's what it
supports right now and then you'd have
an overlay for OBS that shows the DMM or
the thermocouple reader readouts so they
drop that off for me I need to buy a
Raspberry Pi to make it work but this is
actually genuinely really cool and I do
hope to make use of it in a stream of
some kind it would allow us to do an
overlay like in the bottom left corner
or something so that you can see our
voltages and things like that live while
we're working on the product and it has
two k-type thermocouple readouts right
here or mounts right there so I can
connect two thermocouples to it to V RMS
or whatever they may be connected to
under the CPU socket stuff like that so
that's pretty cool
overlay live I have not used it yet but
looks pretty good this next one is from
coolermaster and ok next one is from C
sonic so see Sonic of course known for
making Camelback bottles gave us one of
those this is actually kind of useful at
Show so we'll be hanging out to that
also a stress ball in the shape of a
heart if you've ever been concerned
about companies buying reviewers well I
know I think we all know who's not doing
that headshot on the light holder what
is that what what is this heart-shaped
keyring oh wait no it has a diode in it
okay so see sonic has sent us
third light we can use for these hotel
room shoots they also sent two pens this
this caused a bit of a fight between the
gamers Nexus staff one staff member
received this pen labeled C Sonic Prime
one of the power supply brands and you
can actually see and I'm what we're
gonna have to ruin the lights for a
second that it's a reasonable pen maybe
you'd find it in the $2 drawer instead
of the 99-cent drawer and then there's
this big pen actually sorry zebra I
don't know who they are and that's what
it is
so clearly one editor is liked more than
the other one and then finally they did
give us a mouse pad which has been in
use because the hotel room table that
we're using the mouse on has some kind
of sticky hopefully food substance on it
so we needed that to help us with
mousing surface this box Grand Lux Cafe
is provided by Thermaltake and it's full
of cookies 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 there'll be a
tats one of the more functional gifts
deep cool actually has some of the
cooler products that they've given as
media gifts so this is a a counter to
their showing of products at the show
this year it's got a calendar of deep
cool stuff Baron case liquid for January
and then ends with gamax and assassin 2
and genome ROG wait well they have an
ROG product now okay well I guess their
median gift works because I was not
aware of that this is I think this is
tea they gave us this last year as well
so that's kind of cool I'm not sure
what's in here this year but it's a it's
a tea packets oh thank you deep cool for
that it is actually all all Chinese
characters so I'm not sure if they
brought it over for the show or what
enter max gave us a couple of things as
well
let's check those out I don't know what
to do with it well I don't know if they
have liability insurance but I hope they
do there's a viewsonic post-it note
thing in the bag I was not aware they
were still I guess I kind of knew they
were still in business I haven't had one
of their monitors in 20 years though so
viewsonic post-it notes Oh a viewsonic
pen this so now now we know who's truly
the favorite because this pen is
objectively superior to the others I
don't I don't know what what that is on
the end Corsair stuff of course sir he
gave us a power bank these used to be
pretty common media gifts and are still
somewhat useful so it does 1 amp output
or 2.1 amps output and 2 USB type a and
then a charger and an on/off switch oh
with a tiny flashlight so we have more
lighting options out for our set between
this and the other one oh they also sent
a they also provided a raincoat because
it was raining outside so for CES Vegas
tends to rain like one day when we're
here every year this is actually a
pretty nice coat it's making a lot of
jingling noises right now I'm not sure
where that's coming from
let's locate that oh oh that's
unfortunate we'll have to cut those off
but this is a pretty cool coat otherwise
no this is actually genuine this is a
one of the better like kind of swag
products that companies make and the
fact that they bothered to bring it to
CES when they knew it was gonna rain and
no one would have raincoats that's
appreciated I think we have one more
thing and it's probably that I think
that's the last thing this one's from
one mr. dare Bauer and we'll have
another video about this soon but this
is a so he's got it labeled dare Bauer
and it says german-engineered perfection
there's there's some teasing about that
when we saw it earlier it is a product
we'll talk more about soon
this goes with the deal editing tools
and it should be pretty cool we'll be
testing it once we get back but it's
fairly functional was fairly functional
before I drop stuff and I think that
about sums it up so that gives you some
insight to what happens in terms of you
know people say you guys are all shills
for Intel and the Nvidia simultaneously
clearly it's these companies that are
buying media coverage because well I
guess we just gave them a ten minute
video or whatever this turned out to be
so it worked to some extent but you have
some good stuff some some some ok stuff
and I'll see you all next time subscribe
