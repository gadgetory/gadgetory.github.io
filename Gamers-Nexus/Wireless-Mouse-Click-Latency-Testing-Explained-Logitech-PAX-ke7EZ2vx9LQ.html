at PAX West 2016 we've already talked
about the new mouse keyboard and headset
shown a few days ago today we're looking
at some click the latency testing so
this is Omni more testing methodology
side pretty cool stuff before getting to
how this works the content is brought to
you by iBUYPOWER and their new elements
gaming PC with a full tempered glass
side window and front window so what
we're showing here Logitech's got two
mice on display they have their new g4
o3 wireless mouse it's got a wire coming
out of it I'll explain that in a moment
and then there is a Razer mouse as well
which is a DeathAdder chroma so the
point here as Logitech has explained to
us is not the show necessarily that one
Mouse is better than the other
objectively or anything like that but
that Wireless is not just in transit
inherently slower necessarily than a
wired a mouse so this is something we
talked on Archie 900 review if you
remember that and this is the same
components as in the G 900 Mouse just in
the G 403 in terms
specifically of the the wireless
configuration so what happens here I'll
show you how it works first then we'll
talk about the more specifics if we go
here in their custom-made software we
can click and
got to start at first you can click and
this will start tracking the inputs the
latency from the clicks that I've sent
to the system so you see here we're
between about 10 and 12 milliseconds on
the razer mouse click in that we go to
the Logitech mouse and click and again
keep in mind this isn't to say ones
necessarily better than the other though
the data will show a lot of techs have
been faster Logitech is sitting between
three and a half and five and a quarter
inch milliseconds so the point there
being that with a wireless transmission
to a receiver which is what this is
going into the setup over here that I'll
explain momentarily the Logitech mouse
is actually competitive with the razer
mouse it is not inherently slower
because of the wireless transmission
which is again to the point that of
course many people i've seen speaking
about online if i use a wireless mouse
it's gonna get me killed in game because
it's lower so we talked about the g 900
review i won't go into it too much here
but that's the data the way it works is
pretty cool so they've got a custom
setup and couple tools you can buy
off-the-shelf but there is a custom
breadboard involved this razer mouse has
two cables coming out of it ones USB and
one is the cable that's used to track
the latency
this one's just got the latest the the
tracking cable off of it it's still
transmitting to the USB receiver the
receiver goes into one of these which is
a USB analyzer so that feeds in there
and then that analyzer out the other
side feeds into a USB hub the same is
same for the same is true for the razer
one which goes to the analyzer then to
the hub so the electrical signal for the
click is sent first and that goes
through this stuff it's fed into the
via this wire right here the signal is
fed into this red and black dongles that
go into the custom breadboard breadboard
does some processing a timer is involved
to do the actual time in millisecond
timing and so what comes out is as the
signal we see here so that's the idea
pretty cool set up something that if it
becomes feasible one day I would love to
do for our own test and just because it
does add an objective element to Mouse
reviews outside of the usual subjective
stuff but for the time being that's
that's kind of the concept on the whole
but as always links in the description
below if you want to learn more about
this patreon link the postural video
helps out directly I'll see you all next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
