thought net and I'm joined by Warren
Spector who previously worked at origin
now you're working on System Shock three
is that right yeah I just signed on with
other side entertainment who was working
on underworld ascendant a spiritual
successor to that game and they got the
rights to System Shock and so I signed
on there's no way I'd pass up an
opportunity to work on a new a new
system shot game for crying out loud
absolutely not and what's what's sort of
the state of progress on that where
should people go looking to find out
more the state of progress is its me
alone in a room writing concept Docs so
don't go looking just yet but keep your
ear to the ground and we'll have steps
talk about soon very cool with origin
systems this was obviously one of at
least from our perspective and media was
one of the driving companies in the
early day of games
Wing Commander came out of origin Ultima
you've worked with Chris Roberts Richard
Garriott what was that time like working
with that you know the the original team
origin was an amazing place I signed on
there and and thought I was going to
teach all those guys what interactivity
was all about cuz I came from tabletop
role-playing and it took me about two
weeks to realize I knew nothing you know
but the most amazing thing about it was
you know we we actually thought we were
gonna change the world that we were
doing things that that no one else was
doing I mean games that had an ethical
dimension or cinematic qualities or you
know the the first real-time 3d
first-person fully texture mapped world
anyone had ever seen I mean it's it's
crazy what we were doing and you know I
don't want to say that origin changed
the world but if you look around games
certainly have and I think we were a
little part of that oh it's I think you
were saying earlier in your talk here at
ECG see one analyst was saying a hundred
billion dollar industry now yeah it's
insane
I mean if if you had told me that that
we would be that big I would have said
you were nuts
and you know it's it's received wisdom
who knows if that that particular
analyst is right but if it's true we
really are bigger than movies and music
put together which is kind of incredible
yeah it's crazy and looking back at sort
of the the roots of origin as we know
with Altimas one of the titles you
worked on right I think I worked on more
Altimas than Richard Garriott did I'm
not sure so what what were some of the
stories back then what are some things
you picked up along the way working on
Ultima
well the the biggest thing I learned was
that games don't have to be about
killing stuff when I played Ultima 4 it
was it was kind of mind-blowing
it was about virtue and and what's right
and wrong and that was one of the
reasons I really wanted to work at
origin to work with Richard Garriott who
was kind of the pioneer of that sort of
game that's that's probably the most
important thing I learned and then the
other thing was we really did try and do
things that other people weren't doing
you know I've got a kind of a philosophy
that we're still a medium in progress
and every game should have something
that no one in the world has ever seen
or done before and that was never really
expressed at origin but it was
definitely part of our ethos so it was a
pretty amazing path I thought I was
gonna retire from the place and get get
the gold watch and everything but that's
not the way the game business works
unfortunately right yeah well it was
acquired by EA were you there during the
acquisition yeah I was I was there at
origin when EA acquired us so you were
employed 26 yeah I was I was the 26th
employee of the company which you know
sounds sounds like well that's not so
early but we we got up till I think it
was 350 people so I was I was one of the
old-timers back then what are some of
the game mechanics or story elements
that you feel were
new when you guys were working on it
well I'll tell you a story I was working
on a game called well it was Ultima 6 it
was called Ultima 6 and I was watching
one of the testers play one day and he
was in a place in the game where you
needed a magic spell to succeed to keep
going and it was a place where there was
a portcullis between you and a lever
that would open the portcullis so he
came up on one side and he didn't have
the spell necessary the telekinesis
spell to flip the lever so I was sitting
there going yeah you're you're screwed
buddy you're not making any progress now
and what he did was he had a character
in his party named sherry the mouse and
the portcullis was simulated and I used
the term very lightly it was simulated
just deeply enough that there was a gap
at the bottom and he had sherry the
mouse go under the portcullis go to the
lever and flipped the lever raising the
portcullis and that was a solution to a
problem that Richard and I didn't plan
and he came up with he was the only
person in the world who ever did that
and I fell on the floor and at that
moment I said I'm gonna do that on
purpose for the rest of my life it was
remarkable but that kind of thing
happened all the time there because you
know nobody knew what they were doing we
were making stuff up as we went along
creating genres and and advancing the
state of the art and role-playing and
all that I mean it was it was just an
amazing amazing time yeah I think when
we were talking with Richard Garriott he
was talking about how he started working
with the punch cards when he was first
programming and tile graphics were like
a new thing and
sort of spawned out of ultima yeah so
it's very innovative company I think
well we were all about that you know we
why make a game you already know how to
make or why make something that's just
like what other people are making that's
that's pretty boring you know I the one
of the questions I always ask myself is
do I know how to do this and if the
answer is yes I don't do it I do
something different you know and that
was very much
you know what origin was all about let's
do stuff that other people don't do that
let's try the the hard stuff that we
don't know how to do it was like I said
it was just amazing I have to throw this
one in for the audience have you did you
ever work on Wing Commander or any of
those games yeah I was rich chris
roberts producer on Wing Commander and
I've always been this kind of crazy
combination of creative and management
and I I tried to exercise my creativity
on Wing Commander but Chris had such a
clear vision we we argued a bunch but he
he won most the arguments I I said if I
win three out of ten arguments with
chris Roberts that's a good day and so I
kind of stayed out of it and managed the
project but let him handle the creative
sure so System Shock three keep an eye
out for that in the future and otherwise
