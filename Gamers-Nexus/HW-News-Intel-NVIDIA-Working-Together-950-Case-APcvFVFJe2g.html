news recap we have some pretty
interesting ones for this week one of
which is a an enclosure named the
inferno always a promising name for
something and then we've also got a 950
dollar case we'll be talking about and
the headlining item Intel and NVIDIA
working together before that this video
is brought to you by the new cable mod
Pro Series cable mods new Pro cables
come with pre-installed closed combs for
clean builds accompanied by a revamp to
color style and vibrance the cables are
now using thicker wires and they've also
added right-angled internal USB 3
extension and right angled SATA data
cables by the pro series cable kits at
the link below or customize it your
cable set with the configurator also
linked below so very briefly before
starting we have our new lightweight
hoody pretty cool it's a two-tone hoody
it has the GM logo on the front chest
and then the teardown logo on the back
and we're pretty happy about it you can
check it out on the store at store dock
gamers Nexus net but let's get to the
first main item so the headline story is
interesting primarily because it
involves the silicon giants Intel and
NVIDIA sort of working together it's not
like they're making a product like the
doorbuster news that Intel and AMD were
doing but they were working together
communicating with the US House of
Representatives
IT Subcommittee on AI deep learning
machine learning and the future of AI
the US House of Representatives IT
subcommittee launched a hearing to
increase government understanding of
artificial intelligence and quote to
discuss uses barriers to adoption and
potential challenges and advantages of
government use of artificial
intelligence the end goal was to begin
developing awareness of AI citing that
AI is quote increasingly cited as the
great fear or hope for future
generations this is the US government
and Vidya and Intel both expressed
interest in the u.s. granting public
access to taxpayer-funded datasets
arguing that these would be useful for
improving machine learning models and
expanding deep learning Technology
Development transparency and
accountability were also
urged with relation to AI development
and that's about all we know right now
so there's actually a full hour and a
half long discussion it's all videoed
you can watch the whole thing start to
end if it really interests you there are
a lot of other companies involved too
not just Intel in Nvidia but they are
obviously two of the biggest in the
space the next one is Compu labs at new
desktop which looks a little crazy and
that's because it's a passive cooling
solution that leverages the entire
chassis to radiate heat out of the box
the machine is called the air top to
inferno perhaps not the best name for a
cooling mechanism it's outfitted with
a/c 236 motherboard and i7 7700 K and a
GTX 1080 the most interesting aspect is
the enclosure itself which exists only
in renders right now but will come out
later for what we understand the CPU can
actually a cooling block to the side of
the case of the left side panel and then
that conducts heat and spreads away the
heat load across the entire side panel
surface area a triple walled side panel
has three sets of aluminum fins exposed
to air with the right panel supposedly
responsible for syncing the GPU or some
other components our understanding is
that each side panel has a set of flat
copper heat pipes along the panels and
the air top to Inferno reportedly can
sink 300 watts of heat by using these
side panels as heat exchangers they are
top to inferno is targeted for a June
launch likely at Computex we don't have
pricing yet but it looks interesting in
the least in similar news of unique
cooling systems you may have seen this
one when Jay did his video with post
Malone
it's a 950 dollar case by singularity
computers and this is a new division of
singularity that's focusing on case
manufacturing singularity computers is
best known for its exorbitant high-end
custom PC builds and they've been
steadily expanding their brand into the
landscape of PC hardware under new
subsidiary singularity cases singularity
is set to release their inaugural case
the specter specter is a mid tower
chassis not named after the exploit and
it's constructed from aluminum and glass
and supports up to e ATX motherboards
the focal point of Spector is the custom
ENC machined acrylic block that serves
both a distribution manifold and as a
motherboard tray this custom block is
replete with channels for routing fluid
it has a fill port and a drain port
additionally Spectre comes with an
integrated reservoir so prospective
buyers need not worry about space or
mounting options for cylindrical
reservoirs also the Spector case
includes a space to integrate a pump
with a pump top and cover included users
just need to procure the pump motor all
d5 pumps are listed as compatible this
vector also has mounting points for a
second pump should tandem loops become
interesting and lastly on the rear of
the distribution block singularity
incorporated unique channels and cable
combs for routing and hiding cables
Spector offers three hundred sixty
millimeter radiator support in the front
and top panels and it supports radiators
up to 60 millimeters thick so quite
large
currently there are three two and a half
drive inch bays supported officially but
there's a separate accessory for a three
and a half inch drive if you like your
hard drives and in addition to this
accessories can also be obtained to
mount GPUs vertically and you can also
mount them to the case or to a wall
Spector's front IO consists of USB 3.1
connectivity and audio as a standard and
again nine hundred and fifty dollars
that is for shipping and availability
information the first 100 cases will be
shipping within four to six weeks
and afterwards orders that will take 8
to 10 weeks to ship as it seems like
they're going to be somewhat built to
order if the price seems steep keep in
mind that this is a low volume premium
product that's designed obviously for
one type of buyer water cooling
enthusiasts the case also includes
several components for a custom loop
that would otherwise have to be
purchased separately although it's cold
products the Titan V this week received
one of the only accessories that'll ever
be made for it and that's the ek water
blocks full coverage block which makes
direct contact to the HBM and vrm
alongside the expected GPU coverage the
card can be made to fit a single slot
configuration with the water block
reducing size significantly by half
which is
particularly interesting for anyone who
wants to cram more of these into one
case EJ is selling the blocks at $130
with an extra optional back plate at $40
for the nickel version and some of our
Raven Ridge coverage we talked about
blue screens of death that were
resultant of gpu-z and 3d mark
interacting and funny ways gpu-z now has
an update version two point eight point
zero and that should resolve the BSOD
issues on Raven Ridge processors in
addition to this it's got improvements
for stability and Driver crashes across
just overall and it also has more
support for additional components and
it's got a new tab dxva 2.0 Hardware
decoder information that's been added to
the advanced tab and as a bit of a bonus
it's got now better vram utilization
logging and perf caps at sensing it for
NVIDIA and and the hardware Andy has
also released new updates to its
software including the Radeon software
and drivers a new 18 point 2 point 3
beta driver pack includes performance
uplift for sea of thieves upwards of 30
to 40 percent on some AMD graphics
devices at some resolutions brass
tactics also got updates as did Final
Fantasy 12 not to be confused with Final
Fantasy 15 which is the new one that's
coming out soon on PC
as for resolved issues Andy has fixed
free sync issues in Chrome
fullscreen games and multi display
setups they've also resolved some
flickering when enhanced sync is enabled
lighting corruption and fortnight has
been resolved and they resolved some
audio distortion bugs in relive some
crash to desktop issues were also solved
in for honor and shadow of war which
really just helps us all appreciate how
hard driver development is because you
basically have to support every single
game good luck
so that driver is probably worth
grabbing if you have any of those
specific issues quick update there's a
lot of Intel news we've had non-stop AMD
news for the last year or so but we have
some Intel stuff coming out now so the
quick update first Intel's d GPU story
so Intel put out a statement after the
stories that came out around their chip
that was shown
at the I Triple E conference and the D
GPU that was being discussed is
basically as we stated a prototype I
think we said that several times may
never come to market
it's more of a circuit design test as we
sort of said however they more
specifically said that the words circuit
design test not just a prototype so this
is actually using an integrated graphics
component of Intel's existing lineup
which would explain some of the
frequencies and voltages that we saw
however from what Intel says it doesn't
necessarily have anything directly to do
with DGP is despite the reporting
everywhere for the last week including
our own story but they have reinforced
that they are working on d GPU products
it's just that they don't want anyone to
think that this is reflective of those
so whether or not that circuit design
research ends up in the d GPU stuff in
the future remains to be seen
certainly Intel doesn't want to talk
about any of that now so even if it were
being used there they wouldn't tell us
but hopefully that adds some additional
information on the previous story and
then another Intel story they've got a 5
billion dollar investment going into a
10 nanometer production retrofit on
their Israel facilities they have a
facility in Israel for fabrication of
silicon components this is now being
adapted to fit for 10 nanometer
production it'll be a 5 billion dollar
investment with support from the local
government and it's expected to be done
by 2020 there are hopes that spending
the cash infusion on retrofitting the
facility will help aid with 10 nanometer
production because that's been
problematic for a while now for Intel
and then also interestingly we talked
about the g-49 xx series last week G
4920 and G 4900 those were Celeron Intel
CPUs and now we're talking about the G
5000 series this would be the successors
to the popular G 45 60 and long ago the
g3 to 5h so the 50 550 600 are the main
two processors are talking about today
we have some pretty much final I expect
at this point they are part of the
Pentium Gold Line which is more or less
the new branding for the Intel pseudo
high low end products basically
everything up until an i3
G 5400 is included in this and this new
series of Intel Pentium CPUs should
theoretically be using coffee lake
architecture and will be running to core
for thread configurations ranging from
3.7 gigahertz to 3.9 gigahertz with no
turbo availability as they are locked
from overclocking these will likely be
available with the new 300 series B and
H motherboards and I believe there are
some rumors out there already as to the
launch dates of those as speculated by
the internet so that's all the news for
this week as always subscribe to make
sure you catch next week's recap and we
have some major featured pieces coming
up through the next couple days as well
