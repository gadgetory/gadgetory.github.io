hardware news recap lots of news this
week
sunny Cove of course dominated the news
cycle but also some interesting
discussion from MIT on a new 2.5
nanometer transistor 3d transistor
approach using fin FET design but the
interesting thing is that it's a new
manufacturing technique involving
basically an ion cannon so we're talking
about that for this week very
interesting stuff and the future of
manufacturing process for transistors
and silicon although a very distant one
at that rumors on Andy Vega 2 are in the
news as well as rumors on the RT X 2060
becoming less of a rumor every day and
then also some more brain drain going on
with AMD as more talent goes to Intel
before that this video is brought to you
by MSI's meg xiii ninety ace motherboard
which primarily offers high frequency
memory support for forty five hundred
megahertz kits and tight timings tuning
but also comes equipped with a twelve
phase V core vrm at ready for the ninety
nine hundred k a pre-installed IO shield
and an infinity mirror for RGB LEDs atop
the left heatsink the RGB LED is
synchronized with Emma's eyes mystic
light to support RGB and rainbow LED
strips using the infinity mirror to
cascade lighting learn more at the link
in the description below quick note
before diving in if you didn't see the
disappointment build that we posted you
should absolutely go check it out it's
it's the most cinematic thing we've ever
made but it also has some real content
in there after the cinematic opening
maybe the editors can put in a clip from
that build now or something so you can
check it out and with that we also have
the disappointment build t-shirt which
has effectively concert tour date
listings of all of the most
dissapointing elements of 2018 s
Hardware cycle including things like
spectra and meltdown crypto mining
depleting all the GPUs available Ram
prices the r-tx launch just by it and
the verge pc build which we've listed as
worst PC build so you can check that out
on stored I Kara's Nexus dawn that if
you want to pick one up it is a great
way to support us and to commemorate the
disappointing moments of 2018 by wearing
a constant reminder of them
so moving on engineers construct a 2.5
nanometer
transistor this is some really really
interesting stuff to talk about
researchers from MIT collaborating with
the University of Colorado which is
responsible for working on a new
fabrication technique a modified thermal
atomic level a qing working together
with MIT they have managed to build a 3d
transistor coming in at 2.5 nanometers
using a fabrication process that works
at an atomic level so this is of
particular interest because we see Intel
working towards 10 nanometer and the and
it's fabrication partners working
towards 7 quick note on that 7 versus 10
isn't as easy as 7 is 3 lower than 10
and therefore is 3 better there are
there are other issues to consider like
density you can have a 10 nanometer
process that is better than a 7 and
reprocess or a 40 nanometer process
that's better than a 10 nanometer
process depending on the architecture
the density and things like that so it's
more than just the number in nanometers
it's more than a numerical difference to
consider that said though it is
important to continue to shrink things
so that the amount of transistors in a
given area can increase as well and
density goes up and this is a topic we
discussed probably in about 2010 with a
former Intel employee who worked on the
tick-tock cadence when it was first
created and he had noted to me in that
interview that there was at the time a
clear line down to 8 nanometers he
thought and after that we would have to
use ion cannons by his description of
them to me and that turns out to be
looking pretty accurate actually so what
they've got here in order to do this new
approach the researchers use 3d
transistors they use FinFETs which many
of you are likely familiar with and they
stand vertically like fins hence the
name fin FET it's kind of got a fin on
the end helps with leakage and things
like that and we've discussed all that
in the past as well there are the fins
are thousands of times thinner than a
human strand of hair and to create these
smaller fin vets the team is using a
modified thermal al e or atomic level
atching technique and the result is
FinFETs as narrow as 2.5 nanometers this
theoretically makes them more efficient
than commercial counterparts from what
the MIT report said MIT is website does
a great job at describing the process
writing the following microfabrication
involves deposition growing film on a
substrate and etching or engraving
patterns on the surface to form
transistors the substrate surface gets
exposed to light through photo masks
with the shape and structure of the
transistor all material exposed to light
can be etched away with chemicals while
material hidden behind the photo mask
remains the state-of-the-art techniques
for micro fabrication are known as
atomic layer deposition Ald and atomic
layer edging al in Ald two chemicals are
deposited onto the substrate surface and
reacts with one another in a vacuum
reactor to form a film of desired
thickness one atomic layer at a time
traditional al II techniques use plasma
with highly energetic ions that strip
away individual atoms on the material
surface but these can cause surface
damage these methods also expose
material to air where oxidization causes
additional defects that hinder
performance and the researchers here
believe that the method could be
migrated or integrated into existing
fabrication processes and the real-world
impact would be in the form of dents or
chips higher performance and potentially
increased yields so it's a very
interesting article we would encourage
you to check out the rest of it if you
want to learn more about the future of
this technology and we'll have it linked
in the show notes in the description
below if you want to check that out from
mit.edu and it is just just kind of set
the expectations here this isn't
something you should expect in a cpu
tomorrow or next year or in two or three
years it'll be many many years away but
the research has to be done in order to
ever integrate into some kind of
commercial application so really cool
stuff to see Sonique ov we'll just recap
this if you've missed our videos on
sunny Cove the most pertinent one for
you to check out would be our discussion
with David Cantor a technical analyst in
the industry runs real-world tech and is
one of the one of the leading experts
for any kind of CPU analysis especially
third-party so you should check that out
we'll recap some of it here Intel also
silently launched the be 365 chipset
that was not discussed at the Sun eco
event and then they did discuss the Jena
Levin and XE graphics not T GPUs but IGP
stuff that's still pretty interesting
along with a hybrid x86 approach to
design Intel's architecture day was a
pretty major event they don't really do
architecture days that actually in in
years from what we can remember here but
so it's good it's good to see Intel
getting a grip back on what's going on
and acknowledging that they need to
engage to try and assure everyone that
this ten nanometer stall won't happen
again and at this event it was densely
packed with things like sunny Cove and
the new iGPS and eventually a DGP you
approach probably but D GPUs were not
explicitly discussed at the event aside
from a passing note that well they're
not here but so if you were waiting for
that and for Arctic sound sadly that
news did not come to be it's a couple
years away though
Intel themselves noted a 20/20 window
for an unveil of a d GPU when they did
their set your graphics free campaign
that they did a while ago so for the
major announcements here there's the new
suncove microarchitecture for the core
architecture this is contained within
the greater ice Lake product that you've
likely heard about in the past but is is
technically different by definition of
sunny Cove being explicitly the core
there's also the Xeon and the core
series chips that will bear sunny Cove
and later I believe they were willow
Cove and golden Cove and further Intel
made announcements for the new XE
graphics brand and also hybrid x86 CPUs
so not related to Intel's architecture
day was the be 365 silent chipset
released if you didn't already see that
one so in top hold the wraps off of
sunny Cove here this is something of a
clean slate architecture for the company
it's been stuck on skylake for years now
and stuck on 14 nanometer for years - in
tiles credit 14 manager has had
significant uplift to a point that it's
really pretty impressed
moving from 4.2 gigahertz to 5.0 plus
depend on if you count overclocking or
not but if you don't still
4.2 to 5.0 40 nanometer is pretty darn
good but it's not exciting and it has
stalled Intel's progress to a point
where Andy has been able to catch up in
a significant fashion something that up
until reisen's launched was really not
something that we would expect because
the FX series was just not competitive
in the ways that Rison is so Intel now
has to get moving on this and the new
architecture is tied to a new smaller
process node Intel has since deviated
from tick-tock for years now but they're
still pushing and Intel has a massive
roadblock with a shrink to 10 nanometers
they're stuck with 14 and the sunny Cove
is the first of three new architectures
in Intel's roadmap that are designed to
be portable between nodes and will be
Intel's first raw IPC increase since
Skylink sunny Cove will debut on the 10
nanometer node and is slated for the
first half of 2019 although it isn't
clear which chips the architecture will
accompany for our part we did speak with
representatives at the Intel event it
sounds like Mobile's getting an
immediate focus from what Raja Kaduri
was telling us and desktop will be a bit
later but this is all stuff that will be
will be coming out over the next year -
so interestingly sunny Cove chips will
be paired with Gen 11 graphics as well
and will be branded as well maybe not
publicly but will be ice Lake
functionally something that Jeff
Kampmann from tech report noted when he
took a photo of the heatsink that was
labeled icy Lu even though Intel was not
officially calling it ice like so
accompanying this launch of the jenna
levin graphics engine is an increased
count of execution units significantly
from 24 to 64 with the compute
performance seen an increase as well
pushing Intel into a higher class of
performance - about 1 teraflop now when
we saw the demo we have some b-roll of
it we'll play it on the screen Intel was
showing a Tekken demo where on the left
side you have the or at least camera
left you have the new gen 11 graphics
and then you have the old IGP graphics
versions now these demos are interesting
but the graphics settings matter a lot
to understand if they actually mean
anything when we looked at the graphic
settings
they were 1080p at 85% resolution
skelion which is odd to say the least so
it's basically 9 18 P which isn't a
thing but that would be your functional
resolution and the graphics quality
settings were high for anti-aliasing and
medium for everything else is something
we checked in the graphic settings for
each device they were set the same so it
was a fair comparison it's just an odd
choice of resolution but it's an
undeniable improvement it's just whether
or not that will compete with things
like a PS or low on D GPUs that will
matter and how much it moves the price
target for the low-end CPUs that have
those IG P's integrated Intel is also
finally moving to implement adaptive
sync something to talk about years and
years ago it won't require any external
hardware and will be compatible with
free sync monitors beyond Janna Levin is
Intel's new X II graphics brand which
will take the company into discrete gp2
territory at some point details are
scarce in town mostly teased list more
than anything else however it seems that
with X II Intel is aiming for
scalability hinting that they intend to
design GPUs ranging from integrated
solutions all the way to mid-range and
enthusiast discrete GPU is even
targeting data center these designs will
all likely be underpinned by the same
architecture and Intel also reaffirmed
its plan to bring discrete GPUs to
market by 2020
lastly Intel debuted a new hybrid x86
processor as they called it and this is
built with a new 3d chip stacking
process Favreau's which is as they told
us I believe Greek for awesome although
they haven't really looked too much into
that but fibrosis is what they're
calling it and this will allow various
dyes and silicon to be stacked something
about which we spoke with David Cantor
previously so this is used in
conjunction with
emmab or embedded multi die interconnect
bridges it'll allow chips to be built
with a mix-and-match approach combining
CPUs iGPS and different IO elements with
a high-speed interconnect Intel
demonstrated a working sample for an
unnamed customer whereby Intel combined
one Sonico of core and four atom cores
in a 10 nanometer design coupled with a
separate 22 nanometer i/o tip connected
through CVS or through silicon via Intel
announced that they're planning to roll
out an entire
product with Favreau's design two chips
coming out or entire product line as an
aside for that be 365 chipset it's a 22
nanometer variant of the 14 nanometer B
360 you can think of this as similar to
the previous news of the h3 10 C chipset
which was a specific deviation from the
14 nanometer process so that Intel could
free up stab space and have partners
produce the new extra low low end
chipset but be 365's bit news it uses
the KB Lake PCH it's no doubt another
move to free up fab space as Intel waits
to try and get to its new architectures
on the horizon because 40 nanometer is
still in short supply and it's beginning
to impact sales or at least the pricing
in a significant way to the extent that
Intel has removed about two million
units from the DIY channel and moved
them over to OEMs and sis instead so
Intel's continuing to struggle to meet
40 nanometer demand but at least there
is a target on the horizon for relief
new reports of AMD filing a trademark
for a new Vega logo suggest that the
company isn't done with Vega just yet
looking at the logo one could interpret
it two ways either Vega 2 or as the
Roman numeral 7 VII denoting a seven
nanometer shrink depending on how much
you want to read into it further fueling
the Vega refresh rumour mill is the
discovery of a new device ID and the
Linux drivers Veronica saw one new Vega
20 ID and six new they get 10 IDs while
logos and device IDs can only lead us to
speculation it's pretty clear that Andy
is planning something with Vega and that
it's not completely gone with 64 and 56
so this will presumably exist alongside
or just before na'vi and hopefully we'll
learn more at CES 2019 we already have
mediums booked for just about every
manufacturer so make sure you check back
in early January for our coverage of
that maybe they'll have something there
for us to look at also in the rumor mill
the RT x 2060 now less and less of a
rumor as more reports come out it packs
1920 cuda cores the leaks suggest that
this is launching early next year and
also asserts that the 2060 will boast in
1920 CUDA cores and the tu 106 GPU
silicon the card is also rumored
six gigabytes of gddr5 a comparatively
the current crop of gtx 960 is run 1280
CUDA cores six gigabytes of gddr5 or
gddr5 x after a recent refresh still no
word on tensor cores or real-time ray
tracing for the 2060 cards but they do
have our TX branding and along with many
others in the tech space we've
speculated that the 2060s might not
really have enough power their raw
performance to drive real time ray
tracing in any meaningful fashion unless
you're gonna play it at 720p or
something
so we'll see we'll see what happens but
we're just around the corner from when
announcements typically happen so keep
an eye on the space as we move towards
CES and first quarter 2019 the next news
item is an industry news item but it's
an important one
this is following several hirings that
Intel's done from AMD so it's kind of a
brain drain going on right now we're a
lot of AMD talent in RTG specifically or
the Radeon technologies group is moving
over to Intel the most notable of these
in recent history was Raja Kaduri who
was functionally the head of RTG at AMD
when he was there and Raja has been at
Intel for about a year now
along with Raja went Chris Hook one of
the marketing leads at AMD and also Ryan
shroud from PC perspective since this
changed though another Hardware reviewer
Damian Triola I believe it's pronounced
from hardware dot F R has headed to
Intel and Intel poaching more talented
AMD RTG members because Damian here
although used to specialize in GPU
reviews at the hardware our french
review website has was since employed by
AMD and is now being brought over to
Intel as of November 2018 it seems like
Damian's jump ship to Intel and is now
in a position of tactical marketing
again within intel's at gaming and
graphics department that's recently
grown and intel also recently snatched
up again brian shroud formerly a pc
perspective another former reviewer
moving on to the last news item and
video shares slide again to half value
now of the recent high and a major
investor Softbank
wants out so
we recently reported on Nvidia's
earnings and how they suffered what
Jensen Hahn CEO of Nvidia called
a self-induced quote crypto hangover as
it would seem the Hanover isn't
subsiding anytime soon because Nvidia
put a lot of eggs in the cryptocurrency
basket which failed to really pan out
when the bubble burst at least for
mining anyway so anybody has been left
as a result with excessive amounts of
GPS in the channel particularly gtx 1060
s and this is something we discussed
previously where 1080 s 10 DTI is
leading up to our TX launch we're
finally starting to drop in price
because it was time for those
manufacturers he's got stuck with the
bill of all the GPUs to dump their
inventory and he got affected as well so
they didn't escape the as anybody called
it crypto Hannover completely unscathed
either but as such and vinius had the
temper it's quarter for earnings
expectations with this new dose of
reality and they've lowered the
expectation by more than 1 billion
dollars subsequently the stock market
shares have started tanking in in price
taking a nosedive recently and that
nosedive seems to have not found a
bottom quite yet
NVIDIA shares recently hit roughly half
of their peak value from two hundred and
eighty nine dollars and 36 cents to $149
at least as of the time of this video
worse yet one of Nvidia's biggest
shareholders the Softbank group wants
out according to a report from bloomberg
so Softbank is considering selling
sometime next year after Nvidia is less
than stellar stock market performance
the company originally invested three
billion dollars in 2017 and has since
profited about three billion dollars
they might just be leaving any way to
get that to collect on that check of a
hundred percent profit not bad so that's
