video talking about some of the stuff
that's been going on behind the scenes
lately I'm going to be joined by a
special guest host this week though
she's a bit late showing up for the show
it seems like well there you go right
there
so snowflake joining me we upgraded our
camera obviously you need a cat to show
off camera upgrades and then we've got
some other stuff that I would like you
all to chime in on including testing
methodology for streaming so I've got
some straw polls below I'll talk about
all that in this video along with some
of thoughts on PCIe content the stuff
that just went live got some further
thoughts on that it didn't make it into
that video and our future of potentially
streaming so stay tuned for that before
getting to that this content is brought
to you by EVGA and their 1080p is c2
card which we reviewed recently the 1080
is c2 is a $750 card that's positioned
right in the middle of the pack of the
market but does have an advanced cooling
solution you can learn more about that
in our earlier review click the link
below for more information so let's
start with the camera upgrades first you
may have noticed that we've just gone to
4k video this is our previous workhorse
camera and the 4k stuff started this
week so we've got a couple up now it has
all kinds of new challenges associated
with it but the big thing is that it's
not just a 4k upgrade personally I don't
really care that much about just having
4k I wanted a better sensor first and I
wanted better low-light better noise
reduction and all those things just
happen to come along with 4k so that
means our camera upgrade will be a lot
better with things like low-light
shooting especially because at
conventions we're going to be shooting
still in 1080p for a lot of reasons
mainly size of the files and moving down
to 1080p with the 4k sensor on this
camera it's a Panasonic u X 180 means
that we'll have better noise reduction
sort of built in and some free gain more
or less some free exposure because we're
going down to 1080 so that's all great
things it means that we won't need the
$400 big light on top of the camera all
the time and it is I mean it's really
all the time for those shows this thing
is great but the sensor is one third of
the size of the sensor that's in the
taking the shot right now this is a it's
a workhorse it's 28 megabits per second
for the video 1080p 60fps Canon XA 20 is
the name it's about $2,000 we're still
going to use it for multicam shots in
the future with interviews probably with
Chris Roberts being one of them as an
option but other than that we're mostly
moving to the new UX 180 and just to
show the differences and show the camera
that's shooting right now we're going to
switch back to this one and then you can
watch the next president view on this
camera while I show you the new camera
so this is the new camera quite a bit
larger it's about two times in terms of
length it's a bit taller as well so
we'll have some travel challenges but
nothing terrible we can fit it on plane
still so not a big deal this is the
Panasonic UX 180 just bought it in the
last week or so the biggest thing here
is it's a larger camera this actually
helps us because it should sort of help
study the shots it will absorb more of
the shake and it's got a good heft to it
which really makes it easy to maneuver
the ergonomics also are very good so
this grip kind of support at the thumb
or you can hold it at the top and then
it braces really nicely against the body
if you were if someone were doing a
follow cam shot like Keegan did when we
did the type-a computer market tour so
very good upgrade overall the big thing
here I know a lot of youtubers shoot
with DSLRs I don't really like them for
what we do so you have to remember that
from my perspective we got into video
strictly for conventions so when you
live that way you're really concerned
more about like how do we set up and get
the shot quickly so it's RNG or Eng
electronic newsgathering or running gun
would be the two terms to describe the
way we use cameras in the field and
having a larger camera like this has
some downsides but in terms of
preference I like having all these
buttons right here and I'm not only the
one operating the camera but it means
that we can get to stuff like white
balance or like gain or shutter or iris
all this stuff very quickly and control
it we've got the three knobs as you
would expect on a lens so you've got
focus zoom
aperture and then for other stuff there
actually I think 10 user configurable
buttons so we go through the Medi the
menu settings and configure all the
buttons to do basically whatever we want
specific to an environment
you can also set scene files for a
specific shoot setup like a roll like
this and have it all pre-configured and
then in terms of just usability it's a
lot better but we also have cool
features like a better display that's
easier to see fold in and out like that
flips around all that stuff kind of
standard for the most part and then also
a viewfinder that's now actually usable
the Canon acts 8:22 viewfinder is the
worst thing I've ever used for
viewfinder overall it's a huge upgrade
in terms of technology this is a one
inch sensor so it's three times the size
of the previous one and you can gather
more light as a result we also can shoot
at 200 megabits per second max but we're
shooting 150 megabits per second for the
4k videos and then when we render out
where we're coming down from there as
you would expect because YouTube can't
do much with 150 anyway the file sizes
would just be stupid to give you an idea
of what that looks like shooting at 150
megabits per second means that if you've
got an average length of 40 minutes so
if we shoot a roll for 40 minutes let me
shoot a beat or a roll for 20 minutes I
wish you'd be roll for 20 minutes that's
a total of 40 minutes of footage for a
potential video like a review and
multiply that by 60 you end up with
2,400 seconds
times 150 megabits per second divide
that by 8 to get bytes and you end up
with about 45 gigabytes per shoot so we
have some challenges there we'll be
talking about at some point but we've
mostly got a solution in place already
it's just a matter when we talk more
about how it works so that's that's the
camera upgrade it's just it's better
quality for everything it's easier to
use the shots will be better the lens is
a whole lot better than the previous one
so we can do more work with it and then
there's all kinds of features on the
camera that will make things much easier
in those convention environments and
again this makes more sense for us than
DSLRs because
is it's basically a crew it's always one
other person with me so I'm not the only
operator basically unlike some of the
personality driven channels where they
might be the only person operating the
camera and the information gathering so
I could understand why you'd want DSLR
for that but that's what we've got there
so we're going to switch back to this
camera and then go through the rest of
the stuff like the streaming updates so
that was the new camera I'm really
pleased with the ergonomics on it it'll
be great for follow shots through things
like again marketplaces or just
Convention Center booths all that stuff
and we're going to be using that going
forward but let's get to some of the
streaming clubs so first of all we tried
doing some streaming tests for the first
time where we're actually benchmarking
output performance streaming to a
service through OBS and I want some of
your settings if you are a streamer so
here's what I want to know we're going
to put two links to survey sites below
it'll probably be strawpoll or something
like that and one of them will be about
what encoder you use and what encoder
setting to use if you are a streamer and
the other one is going to be about the
bit rate that you stream at I posted one
of these on Twitter but we were too
limited an options really so chief with
it so basically what I'm looking for is
what's the most common use case in our
community so that I can build that into
our testing and start testing for it in
streaming benchmarks going forward we
did the dual streaming tests I liked how
it worked but I think for for going
forward the plan is probably to focus on
single streams I'm not sure if I'm going
to focus on twitch or YouTube probably I
part of me says twitch because it's so
popular part of me says YouTube because
it's got a higher bitrate cap and I'm
more familiar with it so if you have
thoughts on that as well I guess post
them in the comments below which would
streaming service you prefer to use as a
viewer or as a streamer and we'll
consider that as well but we'll be doing
some more of those the single stream
testing will definitely take priority
because most of stuff we're testing is
going to be a single stream ready not
really dual stream through two OBS
instances ready and I've also heard
about some software to like restream or
websites like restream not familiar with
it the streaming stuff as a streamer is
still new to me for testing so if you
use restream I'm also curious if there
are any major downsides to it where you
would rather use hardware encoding twice
in other words encode the stream two
times and output it twice versus using a
restream service so again are there any
downsides to a restream service that
would be relevant to you so that's what
I want to know that will help me build
our testing methodology for stream tests
going forward and it is it's such a
community thing that so many people are
involved with I think that the approach
to building methods for testing
streaming should probably involve some
portion of the users because again it's
it's big and a lot of people have
experience with it so that's that the
next thing also in streaming news we now
have a set ups in terms of hardware that
can connect that leads to this camera if
not the new one and feed-through laptop
and these live streams from our channel
that you could watch to not not
benchmarking so I want to start doing
those I'm thinking maybe next week from
the posting of this video we'll try one
probably start with something like a
simple teardown and and just do it live
as they say do a teardown see how it
goes and maybe do some more streaming
content like that going forward now to
address some discussions I had in the
patreon discord chat that really won't
impact the quality or quantity of
content coming from us otherwise because
my idea of how to stream because of our
production cycle and because of our
habits with media content creation my
idea is I should be able to more or less
walk into a room turn a few things on
and start streaming and then just do
something I normally would be doing
anyway that day for example when I put
the crack in G 12 on the armored card
that would have been actually pretty
cool thing to stream and we weren't
making content about it anyway so it
wouldn't slow anything down
it would just be part of the normal
review process and you get an earlier
look at some of the stuff we're doing
without interrupting the content quality
or quantity normally so that's a
consideration stay around for that and
make sure you're following on Twitter so
that you can get the updates
when we do decide to try a stream and
other stuff I had some thoughts on the
PCIe content so again this is just like
a community update video which is is
really just going through a lot of the
stuff the last week or so so the PCIe
thetan with Intel the main point of that
was to discuss their marketing language
I cannot stand marketing language that
seems like just marketing
language there's got to be something
behind it so that's why we went at that
from an angle of okay we're going to use
two different CPUs because the language
says 7700 K and 1700 X or whatever so
we're gonna test two different CPUs now
normally what we've done with PGI elane
assignment testing is you use the same
CPU so you control for that and you
control to the cache and speeds and all
that stuff and we control for some of
that with cross-platform but not
everything like cache so you normally
control for that stuff and then you just
change the generation of the pci-e
socket which are reports you're using
you basically change the bandwidth going
through them based on what hardware
you're using to test that's what we've
done in the past if we were doing a
standalone dual by 16 versus dual by 8
benchmarked that's what I would do for
it but again the point was really to
just really seriously spend a lot of
time addressing that marketing language
and talking about how it actually
performs relative to what their claims
were because the way I position our
outlet is to challenge those claims and
make sure they're accurate and if
they're not then hopefully you would
hope manufacturers don't continue making
inaccurate claims in the future that's a
very idealistic thing to say but there's
some impact sometimes so that's the way
I approach these things from an
objective test stand alone ignoring
marketing perspective the PCIe Lane
assignments table is something I do want
to revisit and do more similar to what
we've done in the past with PCIe Lane
assignment where you use again a really
controlled scenario so we might do that
it's not on the immediate radar there's
plenty of other stuff going on but it is
something I'm thinking about I've got
plenty of ideas for it we've done a lot
on in the past but it needs to be
updated with SLI and with 1080p is
stuff like that and go through that x29
nine things CPS again so that's some
thoughts on PCIe Lane testing and then
finally there was some interest in power
supply reviews PSU reviews in the
discord and this is something I've
commented on a few times in chats and
Twitter and things like that but power
supply reviews are really hard you need
good equipment to do it like chroma
Riggs for example which are multiple
thousands of the colors need to get
trained to use those machines I need to
get trained to understand the output
understand the input understand what the
heck the numbers are that you're looking
at and what their implications are and
it's not something we're going to do
right now however there are things that
I do want to get more involved with in
power power supply review is not one of
them today it's frankly my skill level
with power supplies is not high enough
for me to be satisfied with testing and
reviewing them there's a whole lot of
training that would have to happen first
not to say that could have happened we
could definitely consult with people but
there's a lot of other stuff we could do
first and one of those things is improve
power testing on GPUs and CPUs and stop
pulling from the wall and test to be a
rails instead like clamp clamp it and
just test straight from the rails or
something like that so that's something
I want to do is closer to reality than a
lot of other test methods I've been
looking at lately it might start
happening sometime this year no promises
but it makes me feel a whole lot better
about power draw testing because you
eliminate a lot of questions a lot of
platform concerns and you just test it
straight from the source
so you're no longer looking at deltas
wall-to-wall you look at the actual
power draw of the component motherboards
still impact lanes but you get the idea
so that's it for this one as always
thank you for watching you can comment
below with general thoughts especially
with the streaming stuff and subscribe
for more patreon.com slash gamers and i
stopped out directly or go to store that
game as nexus net where we should have
more shirts like this one on the graph
shirt sometime soon theoretically
they're being printed so thank you for
watching I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
