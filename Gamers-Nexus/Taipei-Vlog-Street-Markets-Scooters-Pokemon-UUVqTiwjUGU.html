Computex the biggest PC hardware
tradeshow that we attend anyway there's
me a lot of cool stuff to see this week
but I'm in front of Taipei 101 right now
which is one of the tallest buildings in
the world it was the tallest building
from 2004 to 2008 cost 2 billion dollars
you have to make and is definitely a big
landmark for us we're going to walk
around parts of the area surrounding
Taipei 101 show you what it's like in
the area because we've got about a day
to kill so should be a lot of fun where
you look through one of the markets see
what they have there and maybe we'll
make it back here later in the vlog but
if you don't know this building is
pretty damn cool a couple vendors are in
here we will have interviews and things
like that from there sweet as always but
otherwise let's get started with the
walkthrough in the downtown area
presented with our comments
so this just gives you some perspective
on how tight some of the streets are
there are a lot of these smaller
alleyways that cut through there was one
that we really wanted to film but it
appeared to be a dead end and we'd get
camera equipment and we know how that
ends in the movie so I don't think it's
like that here
busy break
you
so we found some claw games I know what
these are I recognize these because in
the land of America we come from where
you're ripped off playing this stuff all
the time these however are $10 10 MTD so
10 NTD as we can see here we've got 33
cents u.s. if you're not aware of the
conversion rate we're going to give us a
shot not sure which one I'm going to go
for we got a egg creatures or something
and after the egg creatures we got a I
really honestly have no idea what that
is but we have that then we have dogs
with giant heads and the RTF player in
me says that trying to micro one of
these is a better chance so we're gonna
go for that can't quite make it over
there I haven't even haven't even
dropped the claw yet I feel like this is
rigged but we're going to go for this
guy
you can cut that all right round number
two how we're gonna let it stop spinning
hot Omaha lot can be defeated by this
game
some think I can knock it down with this
one pick it up on the next one oh we got
it there you go looking at the nutrition
label eyes as if I can read the
nutrition label right I recognize a few
numbers not about it caramel or cheddar
hey senpai this is literally going to be
killed this this is the end of here's
Nexus it's not death by move headaches
that's my stroller or moped
I found a found a cooling solution for
the Corsair spec for that we reviewed
recently actually actually feels pretty
new moreover they're one of these
vendors we saw earlier had
120-millimeter server fans with finger
guard blowing into the booth for once
one of the food vendors
it's actually a pretty sweet bike
quality license kokom end we got
squirtle
we got the holes down there if you see
the hole there's your hole what do we
learn then we learn that Hello Kitty is
actually a human girl we recently
learned at CES that Hello Kitty is in
fact a human female our shoes dress up
or what
so here now at ATT for fun which is just
kind of a shopping center plaza area
like an indoor mall the theme of this
floor for some reason is Alice in
Wonderland as you can see here it's
going to kind of walk around and show
off what's going on it's raining outside
so we had the dual wield dual wield
umbrellas and head in to get out of the
rain so interesting stuff not sure the
significance will throw to music and
show it off there
Oh
oh come on
all right so I had won one of our team
members Patrick stone asked me to play
pokemon go for him in Taiwan to which I
basically replied now I will however
play this six sixty bucks which is the
that two dollars us yeah
two dollars there we go you ready for
the unveil
Bulbasaur yeah Turner Provost or that
clips into a stand how his a back as his
diaz leaf is off and his back flips and
it all comes together
that's kind of neat neat plastic toy
okay we go with a Hello Kitty pull as
well how come I I don't know anything
about these sure everyone everyone
inside of this family mark thanks for
strange what is it no what'll do I don't
know if I don't like that is now that's
one of the plush characters in the thing
the other day yeah well so one of the
comments and tell us what that is but we
got it so that's pretty sick hi alright
