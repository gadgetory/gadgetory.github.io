m4 motherboards that's the big news here
we have some information on the mains
main stream and entry level and for
chipsets we don't have the Zen chips I
didn't vote just yet but that is of
course still coming out so we'll have
that once it's ready but for now we're
talking about the mainstream and
entry-level chipsets of am for this is a
unified chipset and will also run
through some of the new seven Jenna ap
aspects before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by iBUYPOWER
and their new elements gaming PC with a
full tempered glass side window tempered
glass in the front LEDs in the front and
bottom and it's basically a modified
s340 the new AP is announced are on the
screen now the gen7 high-end AP is the
a12 9800 which runs four of the new
excavator x86 cores at a 3.8 gigahertz
at base clock or 4.2 gigahertz a boost
all the new noteworthy apu is used on r7
graphics chip for the IGP
with the a12 9800 clocked at 11:08
megahertz for the GPU with eight GPU
ciues TDP is 65 watts for all chips
except for the e suffix two chips which
are 35 watts and significantly lower
clock rates the 810 9700 also on the
screen loses 0.3 gigahertz off the base
clock and 0.5 off the boost clock from
the a12 9800 also reducing the GPU
that's 60 years from the 8 on the a12 at
9800 the a6 9600 is comparable just with
it still lower clock rates we think the
x4 950 will be among the most
interesting options since users will be
able to use a low-end CPU with the IGP
disabled for a cheap and more affordable
CPU solution when coupled with a
dedicated GPU for max performance the a6
9500 apu is only a 2 core processor and
isn't really worth considering for most
games at this point this is a low end
consumer part note also that the new
excavator CPUs and am for low-end
platforms will support a maximum of 20
400 megahertz for ddr4 speeds as for the
chipset new is the more interesting
stuff for an for since this will be
applicable to Zen as well
the amp for shipment initially will be
with the be 350 a320 and act
B and a 300 chipsets those our
entry-level and mainstream some of them
actually aren't even something you'll
ever consider for gaming use cases but
at the low end that's what we're
starting with this is a move to unify
the FM and AM platforms so FM 2 plus
will go away as a separate apu platform
and AM 3 has effectively become am for
now obviously so F M 2 plus M 3 have
been unified into am 4 that means your
ApS and in the futures and CPUs will
both use the same platform and that
means that if you buy an APU early you
could theoretically upgrade it to Xen in
the future now obviously in that case
you'd want to check the official support
list for CPUs on the motherboard
because there is a good chance if you
buy a low-power CPU or CPU and you plant
a couple with the motherboard obviously
it'll need to support that higher TDP
from these end chips as they roll out we
don't have the Zen chipset yet but all
of the chips that's will natively
support PCIe gen3 that's of course the
biggest news here even though we're not
really fully saturating the bandwidth in
most use cases just yet also natively
supports USB 3.1 gen2 and everything
below that USB 3.1 John 1:3 point Oh
things that am3+ did not support FM 2
plus did in some cases this is a big
move for AMD because again it's unifying
those platforms so that sticks to their
sort of approach of trying to make it
easier to upgrade the CPU only and keep
the same platform a motherboard with
your system in terms of parallels the DB
350 somewhat parallels that the 970 of
the previous platform and the a 78 on
the FM to a platform B 350 has a 5.8
watt TDP as opposed to a 7.8 watt TDP of
the a 78 chipset and even higher on the
970 19.6 20 watts somewhere in that
range for the low-end chipsets the a320
coming out on a m4 that parallels the
760 G and the a 68 G which you may have
never even heard of because they are
very low and nos and then we'd really
normally
commend but those are the comparisons to
the a320 that one should probably be off
your radar for the most part SFF small
form-factor will use the XB and a 300
chipsets we don't have a lot of
information on those just yet in terms
of specs the gen7 AP is support dual
channel ddr3 point 1 gen 2 and 2 SATA 3
ports and two nvm Elaine's or
alternatively two extra SATA 3 ports and
two PCIe lanes for MDOT to usage the be
350 chipset will support two USB 3.1
gen2 2 USB 3.1 gen2 on and at 6 USB 2.0
with two state of three lanes present as
well and the SATA II support is apparent
in one single SATA II slot and that can
be peeled off for two additional state
at three ports instead if you prefer
that's done by the motherboard
manufacturer of course still on B 356
PCIe gen 2 lanes are available for m2
and general purpose devices and SATA ray
to support a 0 1 and 10 am for h20 the
chipset will lose 1 USB 3.1 gen2 channel
and 2 PCIe gen 2 lanes and the xB and a
300 chipsets will lose the raid 10
support among other features that we
might talk about in the future but not
today as for performance we've got some
charts from AMD these are claiming equal
performance in PC mark 8 home
accelerated watt 4 watt with an i5 6500
65 watt CPU on an a12 9800 at 65 watts
and these claiming 17 percent higher
performance against an i5 6500 T watt 4
watt versus an Intel i5 6500 T 35 watt
CPU again versus the H valve at 9800 a
3,500 Y APU and 3dmark 11 which is
ancient at this point and II is claiming
nearly a 2x performance gain against the
IGP of their selected Intel CPUs and
note that this isn't a 100% CPU CPU
comparison because the AMD is faster
memory for their own test systems in the
end notes show that AMD is running ddr4
2400 while intel's running ddr4 2133 but
obviously Intel can't support 2,400 so
that is one fair
point though the memory can't account
for some of these changes so performance
will be dragged down on these chips
that's a little bit partially because of
the memory speed limitation other
limitations as well in comparison to the
Zen chipset coming out later we from
what we understand anyway the memory
speed will definitely account for some
sort of a semi apparent speed loss but
they are ap use and APU chipsets
even though they're on the m4 platform
so you're really not meant to
necessarily use these with AMD Zen the
Zen chipset still forthcoming don't know
a lot about it yet officially though we
have detailed the AMD Zanta architecture
in at least some aspects on the channel
so you can hit the channel in the
description below check out those
information videos if you want to learn
more about the architecture itself or is
N and then as always patreon link is a
postural video to help us out directly
