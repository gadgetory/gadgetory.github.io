Computex
2017 looking at one of the stars of the
show is an axe 399 motherboards we've
shown a few axe 299 motherboards already
this is the first one we're looking at
for AMD's cred Ripper lineup X 399 we're
be going over some of the board details
we've looked a little bit at the power
design don't have a whole lot of detail
for you and we'll walk through some of
the other stuff we've observed on the
board before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by course
their and their t1 race chair you can
learn more in the link in the
description below q on race chair is a
bucket style gaming seat that cost $350
let's get into actually 9 on
motherboards so this is the zenith
extreme it will be an Asus flagship
board they have more boards forthcoming
but this bone they're showing today at
Computex the zenith extreme as we see it
here first of all let's talk about the
socket so the socket for thread ripper
is massive plainly it's got three screws
that are torque style screws as we
understand it now either an V or the
motherboard vendor will include a tool
for that but probably the mothers were
fender so you actually have to unscrew
these get access to the socket and then
if we were to pull this plate off the
die would be about the size of these
this kind of rectangle area here we have
a die photo from the Andy press event
earlier that we'll show in one of our
articles so that's your your actual
cooling target for cold plates
underneath there's kind of a split where
it'll look like the pin it's an LG a
socket are split between the two dies so
again we have photos of that from the
AMD event but that's what we have for
the socket it's large on the backside
there's a huge piece of metal to hold
and retain it all in place
speaking of cooling so there's an
interesting challenge here where a lot
of the coolers on the market have a much
smaller cold place or contact area than
the size of the actual IHS fortunately
it doesn't really matter if the IHS is
large because what we really care about
is going to die we'll see in testing
obviously how that actually works out
thermally but the theory is you could
actually use a standard like cold plate
on any CLC on the market as long as
you're covering the die okay but again
we're looking at in the CB review going
back to the motherboard for power design
it looks to be an eight phase-- v core
design I don't know the power components
of fire I'm thinking international
rectifier though because we're
everywhere this show every single board
we've seen so eight phase-- memories to
phase so it's eight plus two that's too
precise we've got two and two for the
phase in on the memory and then moving
down the board and looking at the PCIe
slot the PCIe setup here there are four
total full 16 length
plots on the zenith extreme and then two
of them are we can actually see
physically wired x16 right here and x16
right here if you look at the physical
wiring for this one on the backside the
board sacks 8x8 then you've got the
other smaller slots there as well
Red Rivers supports 64 PCIe lanes so you
could actually do quite a lot but for
what we're looking at here you can
definitely do two full acting setup
moving on from those and looking at some
of the other things on the board a lot
of the stuff on the bottom asus has had
for a while now on their boards there is
a 4-pin molex for extra GPU power for
GPU overclocking and remove some of the
strain from the PCIe socket itself and
then moving right we've got normal USB
USB front panel all that stuff with your
safe boot and reset switches for
overclocking
which are things that we actually use
that red button quite frequently in our
own overclocking with a m4 and the rise
in line there is standard SATA over here
and then plenty of it there's m2 support
under this plate so for i/o and storage
you can remove these two screws and
remove the glossy part of the chipset
cover that comes out and then there's an
MDOT two socket under there I don't know
the details on how they're cooling it or
what the thermal pad is there anything
like that but you could put an m2 device
in there this we've got you dot to
support and SATA
USB 3 going up the board start and reset
button things like that and then
interestingly to eight pin power
connectors in the top right as I
understand it now it's something like an
eight plus four standard but they're
going with two eight pins here being in
a flagship for that kind of makes sense
if they're try to make sure they support
overclocking towards the heat sink just
briefly
he thinks here we've got a standard
aluminum heatsink these aren't all that
critical or power component cooling
anymore well they do have a heat pipe
running out of this side and going down
the side near the memory then you have
your i/o cover
there's an OLED screen here where you
can configure for time flashing for time
customs outputs things like that so that
is the Asus zenith extreme board for
thread Ripper we'll have more
information as always a link in the
description below in the article if you
like our coverage you can go to
patreon.com/crashcourse and actually
salvage that directly and subscribe for
more we have plenty more for the show
thank you for watching I'll see you all
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
