the Fujitsu micro electronics for 371
million dollars which gives AMD a bit of
a cash injection and helps move them
toward becoming properly fabulous which
is something they've been trying to do
for a number of years now so this is in
line with their original shift to give
globalfoundries their fabrication
operations and now they're moving away
their testing packaging and basically
product assembly applications to this
Fujitsu micro electronics group which
will now own eighty-five percent of
AMD's stake in the a TMP group this
allows AMD to continue focusing its
logistical efforts entirely on
engineering and software and the asset
sale gives them a bit of cash but just
for reference other vendors like Nvidia
and Qualcomm are also effectively
fabulous so that's really not that big
of a difference at this point with Andy
versus some of its major competitors in
terms of their fabrication philosophy
Intel remains one of the few juggernauts
which still owns fabrication plants
entirely on its own alongside the likes
of Samsung this news is just kind of
interesting so we just got back from pax
east of course and the Boston Convention
Center this year was upgraded with all
aruba networks access points and routers
which the ones that use cost about a
thousand dollars each and they have more
than 500 of them deployed at the bcec
this effort was so that the pax
attendees could actually access wireless
internet while inside the convention
center for those of you who haven't been
to a convention where gamers are present
it is effectively impossible to use the
internet or Wi-Fi normally so this was a
big deal and it actually did stay up
pretty much the whole time they had more
than 36,000 total unique users
throughout the weekend pax is known to
have about 70,000 plus attendees and
there was no major down time this event
so that's effectively unprecedented for
a major gaming convention total uplink
and downlink bandwidth just for a fun
fact here the total utilization of
network traffic throughout the weekend
hits 16.1 terabytes of data which was
processing at nearly 500 megabytes per
second over the three-day event with the
more than 36,000 users on the wireless
network peak concurrent traffic broke bc
ii c records at 15,000 users all at once
of course
only twenty-five percent of total
traffic was used by wired booths like
blizzard with overwatch or cliffs to do
with lawbreakers and other games this
news item came out of pax east and we
already talked about it in depth but
it's the appearance of you two
connectors on consumer grade
motherboards so this was done with the
gigabyte boards that we just recently
looked at you dot 2 is somewhat
comparable to m dot two we've got a
whole video comparing the two of them if
you want to know more but the basics of
it are that u dot 2 and m dot to you
both use PCIe lanes for their storage
transfer their protocol and that is a
maximum of four lanes per device so you
know four lanes to you to four lanes to
m dot to the major difference here is
that you dot to more closely resembles
SATA connectors and even SAS connectors
on the drive side which means that they
take a blessed space on the motherboard
so there's less physical you space used
for the board on like m dot to which
uses a pretty large footprint and it's
also a double stacked cable so it's kind
of like if you imagine to say two
connectors stacked on top of each other
on the board that's what you to looks
like but using PCIe so you've got much
greater throughput potential in the span
of several gigabytes per second versus
the SATA sort of 500 megabytes five and
fifty megabytes per second limitation
although the lane assignment is the same
between m dot two and you to the
theoretical maximum speed of you two so
far has become more saturated than m dot
2 has offered for consumers and that's
just the nature of having 2.5 inch sized
SSDs with the you to interface which is
its primary advantage because they're
just cheaper and they have higher speed
controllers in them for the ones we've
seen so far the U dot 200 face looks a
bit like the SAS connector on the drive
side it's got extra PCIe lanes over some
of the existing options and the Z 170
and x 99 HSI Oh lane architecture means
that motherboard vendors can sort of
independently determine how many you two
ports they want on the board and the
last item is pretty quick seagate has
just begun shipping their ten terabyte
Enterprise drives these are hard drives
filled with helium by the way to their
their enterprise clients and that would
include people like super micro not
really consumer targeted at all right
now but these high-capacity drives will
eventually make it to consumers with or
with
out the helium aspect of it the drives
have seven platters and 14 heads and
they now even use smart data to tell you
when the helium starting to run out
which really shouldn't happen any time
soon but it's certainly possible that's
all for this week's hardware news recap
