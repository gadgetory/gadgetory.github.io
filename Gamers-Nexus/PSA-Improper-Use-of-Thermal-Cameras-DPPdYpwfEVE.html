demonstration of science experiments
showing improper use of thermal cameras
and how to correctly use them at least
at a very top level because this is a
common problem these things are so
common i buy these for a couple hundred
bucks for phones that they're kind of
proliferating everywhere and they're
normally used inappropriately in ways
that actually provide temperatures that
are completely useless so we're gonna
show why and how that happens
specifically using a case in tempered
glass as an example before we get into

Nexus for 5% off so this is something
that we discussed briefly in our EVGA
vrm thermals video where we were
demonstrating how does a thermal camera
respond to a backplate versus a
thermocouple or a direct probe but it's
better demonstrated on something like
this I've lately seen a few people
pointing thermal cameras at cases that
are closed with glass on them or acrylic
or something like that and it's not a
good way to get your measurement so why
is that well first to kind of note very
briefly how thermal cameras work the
very top level is that with a lower
temperature you're going to have a
longer or protracted wavelength it's
obviously this sees wavelengths that we
can't really necessarily see there is
visible spectrum thermal vision so to
speak if you heat up an iron and you
pull it out of a furnace and you look at
it it's probably going to be red or
orange or some hot color and you can
tell by looking at that as a human but
we can't always see the heat that
something produces the components in
this case I can't see with my eyes how
hot they are but they produce a they
radiate the heat and that's thermal
radiation which we can measure with a
camera like this even though this is a
cheap one it's a thermal imaging device
it looks at infrared for it's for what
it's producing when you're seeing the
red colors and the blue colors on your
screen for the temperature values but
how does it do that like I said the
lower temperature is going to be a
longer wavelength and these devices
can be customized but they often show
blue for a lower temperature or green
and then the higher temperatures are a
much more intense wavelength there the
peaks are closer together and when the
peaks are closer together you end up
it basically means there's a hotter
temperature so whatever your point into
that is going to be harder to touch and
the relationship between the radiation
intensity and temperature is the
stefan-boltzmann law which we won't get
into today that's way out of scope but
you can see the basics on the screen and
the camera sees temperature from a few
different sources so this camera here
the infrared camera is this is a Seikh
thermal one I bought myself it sees the
temperature readout that we get the sort
of human readable temperature has three
different items
there's emission so what how much heat
is being emitted
there's transmission or sort of what's
going on beneath the surface if he's
being transmitted almost in a
subterranean fashion we can call it
below the surface and then the third
item is what is reflected and that's the
point of this glass which we can
demonstrate really easily so this is an
example of an improper use case for
pointing your thermal camera and we've
got other tools for this I have for
example thermocouple readers which that
has two k-type thermocouple is coming
out of it you can figure it three k
types you calibrate them we use boiling
water and hot water I've calibrated them
a while ago so I know the the range of
the two thermocouples and it's generally
about 2.2 Celsius which I know thanks to
Bobby Kim stole from Corsair and then
there's another type of device like this
which is basically a laser pointer and
it reads the laser and the temperature
of the surface you're pointing at but
this is all kinds of flawed too we're
not really going to get into that today
what we're getting into is this so let
me do a demonstration so right now we're
looking at the case in front of me and
what it's showing is with the side panel
on we have prime95 with L F of T's
running on the system and fur mark
running so this is a very tortured
machine it's an S 340 elite pretty bad
cooling performance as we've shown but
the temperatures here it's saying well
if you point out the CPU cooler area
which by the way you'll notice this very
bad resolution which you'll see it
improves when I remove the glass
CPU cooler areas clearly there it's
somewhere around 35 degrees according to
this but there's a big flaw and that's
that there's reflection in the glass so
if we I see your legs where's my hand so
he can actually you can see and you're
the camera man's legs reflected right
here and I think part of my body is
reflected here that's not good that
means you can actually see my hand
moving around there in the background
too it's it's not quite as easy to see
but there it is over there on the far
right side you can see the hand
reflected that's useless that's not the
temperature of the inside of the case
that's the temperature of what's being
reflected so this is part of knowing the
emissivity of the object that's under
test if you don't understand the
emissivity what the sort of the emission
index is what the number is it's 0 to
1.0 is the scale and this ideally you
have let's say a painted black piece of
steel that would be what you call an
ideal blackbody for in the world of
physics for measuring temperature this
is not that so if we remove this panel
c40 see see my hand holding it up let's
remove that panel and see how things
change now we can see the computer much
different let me put this glass down so
now we can actually see the components
you can individually make out the CPU
cooler that's the msi cooler you can see
the GPU the back plate and the vrm area
is about 70 C from this distance which
is how they flow on these things and
then we can see the individual
motherboard components you kind of see
the RAM this is obviously a far
different temperature now I I would not
recommend ever taking measurements of
components with this because that's not
looking at diode temperatures we don't
know what the core temperature is by
looking at the temperature of the CPU
cooler we don't know what the GPU core
or the vrm temperatures are by looking
at the temperature of the heat pipes
which are up here or the shroud or of
the back plate and these if you have a
shinier back plate even worse if you
have a shiny like copper nickel alloy or
something for your
for whatever material you're measuring
the thermals of your reflectivity your
emissive index is probably something
like 0.03 or 0.06 something like that
for something shiny like electroplated
copper or copper nickel alloy or
something like that totally useless
measurement because all we're seeing is
the reflection of other things basically
if I took a thermocouple and stuck this
to the different parts on the system
primarily the reflective ones we would
get a much different temperature and
this will take a moment to heat up so
the larger number up here is around 50
Celsius that's the temperature of the
particular heat pipe in the specific
spot that I'm touching this thermocouple
the lower-left temperature is now the
ambient temperature of the room about 23
Celsius but we're looking at somewhere
under 50 C for this thing 45 something
like that let's look back at our thermal
camera see what it thinks it is the
resolution here is not great but I can
still get an idea where is our where's
our heat pipe that would be right about
there I can't even get an exact
measurement but it is well above 40 this
is looking like let's see let me use my
hand here to pinpoint there's my hand so
there is the heat pipe move my hand and
that's in the red white area so it's
somewhere in the 70s high 67 DC area
it's not white-hot that's up here closer
to the PCB but the point is it's several
degrees higher than what we were seeing
with with the thermocouple neither is
necessarily a perfect way to measure
that he wouldn't really need to measure
a heat pipe but that's an example of how
the
emissivity index is interfering with our
measurements you can calibrate these
devices maybe not the phone ones but a
good fluke meter or something
if you calibrate in a way that would
better account for the emissivity and an
easy way to do that would be to paint
one of these heat pipes just black and
then you take a measurement of it black
and you can use that versus the other to
get an idea of how do we calibrate this
device to read an appropriate
temperature but again not an ideal use
case what these are useful for if you
look at a system like this it gives you
an idea of where are my hot spots in the
case even you have to take in all these
things to account like the emissivity
but you can still use it as a good tool
to figure out where am I getting a
little too hot can I move my fans around
it's just not a perfect way to measure
for diodes you want to use software like
the CPU core temps and the GPU core
temps for MOSFETs you can really only
get the case temperature easily anyway
and you would want to use a thermocouple
for that and then anything else that
requires a different type of probe than
what we have on the table so I think
that gives an idea of how to use these
and how not to use them fluke has a
really good article it's a PDF on base
that some research they did explaining
emissivity and how to use their devices
and they have a really good article put
on the screen now where they do a
similar test but a bit more advanced
they bake a block of stainless steel so
they put it in an oven for three hours
of the high temperature and they paint
half of it black and they leave half of
it stainless steel and take a
measurement with one of their meters
uncalibrated for the emissivity and they
report a difference of more than a
hundred degrees Fahrenheit between the
two halves so this is a piece of steel
that's been put in an oven it's one
uniform piece it's the same core
temperature if you were to bore a hole
into it and stick a thermometer and
they're almost like you would do with a
steak or something like that it would be
the same temperature on either side
within reason but they painted one half
black and left one
reflective and the difference was
something like 100 degrees Fahrenheit so
that further demonstrates this issue
we're using a thermal camera incorrectly
with the glass on totally useless
results of course we don't get anything
close to the temperatures this is
actually experiencing have no resolution
and we're seeing more reflection of me
and whomever else is in the room then
the in turn of the case but when you
pull the glass off it's still not
perfect so it can't be reported as hard
fact what different temperatures are
without first accounting for emissivity
is the thing you're pointing at really
shiny if you've got a CPU cooler that's
something like the old Zalman ones that
were just really really shiny copper or
nickel plated copper those metrics
without calibrating for them are useless
you'd be better off with a thermocouple
that you've also calibrated or something
else like just using salt or to measure
core temps like people would normally do
because this is kind of not really a
normal way to measure your temperatures
how effective a case is but I think
that's enough for now so that's the PSA

devices hopefully you know a bit more
