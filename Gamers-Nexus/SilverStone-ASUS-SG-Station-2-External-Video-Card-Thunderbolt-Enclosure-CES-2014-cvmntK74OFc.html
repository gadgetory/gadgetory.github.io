Nexus Donna and at CES 2014 once again
we are in Silverstone suite I have right
here an external video card enclosure of
sorts it is connected via Thunderbolt
interface and right now we have an AMD
card in here it is I think it fits up to
13 inches of video card so as far as we
are concerned that's just about
everything on the market this is called
the XG station 2 it is a collaboration
between a suits and Silverstone ACS
working on the PCB electrical stuff
silverstone working on of course the
enclosure and cooling as they do best
for the most part this is a full
aluminum enclosure we have some steel
structural stuff going on the top and
the bottom and there is a single 120
millimeter intake fan down here and then
we have a 450 watt power supply toward
the top with of course its own fan for
closed loop power supply cooling as
usual currently this opens pretty easily
we have two thunderbolt outputs in the
back and then these standard video card
outputs in here as well and the point of
this if you're wondering is to connect
to the laptop or whatever other device
like that that you've got going on with
thunderbolt enabled so we can actually
run your video or your graphics from the
laptop through our dedicated video card
which is of course much better if you
have a if you want to keep a lighter
weight laptop and then turn it into a
desktop when you get home so that's the
XP station 2 we are currently unsure of
a release date or MSRP target hit the
link in the description below for full
details and yeah we'll see you all next
time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
