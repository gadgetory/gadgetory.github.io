study and benchmark on Apex legends
performance across a wide range of GPUs
for gaming PCs but now it's time to turn
our in-house software loose on the Xbox
version of apex legends the game is no
doubt popular and given its requirements
maintain consistently high frame rates
we thought it about time to see how well
the game runs on our Xbox one X went
under various load conditions throughout
the game including fov testing all the
way up to 110 degrees today we're
looking at apex legends at frame time
performance and frame rate on the Xbox
one X before that this video is brought
to you by the gigabyte ARS ad 27 QT
gaming monitor the ad 27 QT is a 27-inch
1440p gaming display with 95% of dcpip 3
color saturation for high color accuracy
accompanied by a 1 millisecond response
time 10 bit IPS panel and display HDR
visa certification
additional features include fluid
adjustment and slide RGB LEDs for
personal Flair and firmware features
like cooldown counters at reticles and
adaptive noise reduction learn more at
the link below
we can pull some information from our
earlier PC testing to inform our Xbox
testing of apex legends in some of our
tests we found that performance varied
heavily from region to region and apex
legends we can show some PC footage of
that with the initial drop into the game
exhibiting the worst example of
performance we mostly wrote this off as
inconsequential seeing as it only
happens once per game but it's still
important to be aware of your
performance floor the same is true with
the Xbox as we'll show you throughout
this video and the reason for that is
because of the tremendous draw distance
in apex legends framerate primarily
drops more as you look out toward the
horizon at a slight isometric angle
downward to observe the heavy geometric
complexity of some of the mountains as
opposed to looking straight down and
seeing a much more limited scope of that
terrain geometry some commoners have
postulated that the game is rendering
everything constantly and it's full
quality but this is extremely inaccurate
it is false plainly the game still calls
objects like nearly any game does it's
just that the draw distances are long
enough and there's a lot of complexity
in the distance
environments that you do see the heavier
impact the framerate where other games
might not show it there's clearly LOD
scaling some of our PC footage
illustrates this as does the Xbox
footage as there's it means to optimize
for performance without sacrificing too
much of a competitive edge there's also
object : and poppin and it's visible
most clearly during the drop in sequence
when you can heat some of the containers
disappearing and reappearing on the
camera depending on how close the player
is to the ground
apex legends on Xbox one X runs at the
near constant 60fps respawn has chosen
to be aggressive with dynamic resolution
scaling on consoles so although the game
doesn't run at native 4k the
responsiveness and smooth frame rate
make it preferable to our experience
with pub G on the Xbox now we can pull
some of our old footage as a reminder of
that overall poor experience before we
proceed with performance numbers here's
a quick refresher on our software this
is sort of a tutorial of the software
well you're seeing on the screen is an
example of some of our software capture
from a previous review maybe the
PlayStation classic frame times are
presented on the bottom rather than a
frame rate as frame times are the most
accurate representation for live frame
to frame playback the playhead in the
center is the current frame and ideally
the line is perfectly flat to indicate a
steady framerate incoming frames are on
the right side of the line pass frames
are on the left side of the playhead and
the axis is in seconds the current frame
time is displayed in the top left rather
than the frame rate because frame rate
is inherently an average over time
frames per second and so you sort of if
you're looking at the frame rate of one
frame that you're looking at now it
doesn't make a whole lot of sense so we
show the frame time for that and frame
time if you don't know is a way to
describe the frame to frame interval or
the period of time required to render
the next frame presented on the screen
it was present being another keyword in
frame delivery a frame time of sixteen
point six six seven milliseconds is 60
fps thirty two point three three is
30fps and fifty milliseconds is 20 fps
if you do prefer to use frame rate
because it's a bit more relatable this
is determined by just dividing a
thousand for the number of milliseconds
in a second by the frame time which
results in your frame rate the trouble
is that frame rates are inherently
misleading and DBA
from the base metric of time they're
still really useful though they're
incredibly useful we use them everyday
they're really easy to relate to but
it's not the perfect metric and so it's
important to look at something like
frame time for the fluidity of the
output let's look at Apex legends now
I'll show one of our initial combats
with relatively high system load we've
probably been showing one of them up
until now as well there are definitely
some frame time spikes to be seen in
some areas despite an overall relatively
smooth sixteen point seven millisecond
or 60fps experience the most stressful
and most repeatable these spikes is in
the initial flight or the initial fight
in high conflict areas like high tier
loot zones and in that drop where you're
flying down towards the ground even the
Xbox one X which is the high tier of the
Xbox and I think that's the plural
struggles one locate at distant areas on
the ground spiking to thirty three point
three milliseconds constantly and
occasionally even 50 milliseconds are
about 20 FPS if you wanted to convert it
looking straight down or at the sky is
of course less demanding as fewer
objects are drawn and the GPU gets a
break from the extreme draw distances as
does the CPU because it's getting hit
with fewer draw calls and the heavier
drop load reduces as the players View
approaches the ground and fewer new
objects need to be streamed in with
objects exiting view getting cold from
the render pipeline the drop is the
worst case scenario in the game or one
of them we do have one instance that's a
bit worse than this with the creeping
barrage will show that later but it's
streaming new objects and textures
rapidly into memory crunching geometric
data and filling the screen with
environmental data as you come down
towards the Earth and because the draw
distances are lawn even on the loot
crate's which are critical to game from
a gameplay standpoint everything is just
it's the render pipeline it's getting
filled with a whole lot of data that's
not really cold until you're extremely
far away from it so this is mostly
interesting as a demonstrations it's
having a low frame rate before combat
begins doesn't necessarily hurt gameplay
still during the drop sequence those
frame drops can be noticeable to players
more accustomed to higher frame rates
then say 20 to 40 FPS average in actual
gameplay the most frequent spikes we saw
weren't always tied to water or smoke as
our PC benchmarks would lead us to
expect in PC benchmarking and we can
show one of those GPU benchmark charts
now maybe 1080p or something with a lot
of cards on it we've
that the river zones had some of the
heaviest GPU load when splitting the
view frustum between the river and the
distant mountainous geometry instead of
this being the heavier loader on the
Xbox there were occasional frame time
increases while simply running around
the environment didn't require anything
special like water and part of this gets
complicated because it's dynamic
resolution scaling with a backs of
legends so the resolution of the game is
changing constantly as it tries to
account for those more intensive scenes
these often appear to be tied to loading
in objects and new areas we have some
footage of that and it continued to
happen even indoors we believe that much
of the frame timing consistency here has
to do with dumping old data and rapidly
pulling in primitives and textures for
the upcoming scenes but it's more
noticeable in this game than others due
to those extreme view distances feeding
into this there were multiple spikes
while climbing ropes which would
reinforce the hypothesis that rapidly
fetching new data for wider view is most
heavily impacting the pipeline although
water didn't inherently mean a lower
frame rate like it did in PC testing it
didn't help once the going got tough and
one of Patrick's fight scenes and I'll
credit it to him because neither one of
us is proud of our fighting abilities we
can see grenades detonating water
splashing from bullet impacts
post-process filters as we heal and
shield allies and fire from explosives
and none of these is singularly
impressive as a graphical effect but
combining all of them together and then
shoving it into an Xbox is difficult to
process all of this together made for a
fight sequence that stuttered between 33
points 3 milliseconds and the more
desirable 16 millisecond frame times it
constantly never quite finding
consistency and that inconsistency is
what's the most noticeable not just
hitting 33 constantly or hitting 16
constantly you're kind of ok neither one
of those especially 16 but inconsistency
once you deviate beyond them the mean
frame time of more than 8 to 12
milliseconds it does start to become
noticeable to the player especially
frame the frame but nothing was that bad
overall truthfully it's still playable
it was overall fine despite the
intensity for a few seconds we get hit
by another round of stutters when we're
downed by a smoke launcher we have time
stamped clip of that too for the editors
whose smoke then causes
more frame time variants as it thickens
finally ending the scene frame time
spiked erratically when we get hit by a
creeping barrage which is something you
can see coming on the frame time plot
before it even happens if we pause the
frame or maybe replay it a few times
you'll see it coming up on the timeline
ahead of the playhead and you know it's
coming at this point so if you could
actually see this in gameplay well one
you'd be able to see the future but two
would be really useful so there's a few
times where if we look at this in slower
motion you can see exactly when the
frames are dropped frame time spikes all
the way up to 67 milliseconds briefly
and holds that 50 milliseconds for about
one and a half seconds this is
noticeable in gameplay and becomes
stuttery although the stutter is
tactically brief at one point five
seconds a sixty seven millisecond frame
time roughly calculates out to 15 fps
and it's surrounded by a bunch of twenty
FPS frames over that time period so
because fps is a inherently a rate over
time it helps to know the time that
we're looking at 1.5 seconds here so
with our average FPS for that 1.5 second
sequence we're at about 28 fps and
obviously sometimes a bit worse than
others the frame the high spikes don't
mean up the biggest drop seems to be
from the heavy filters applied to the
screen as combined with the smoke and
fire effects being rendered just outside
of the view frustum or slightly coming
into it not everything is like this
though we're just highlighting the most
exciting scenarios by which of course we
mean the most intensive because honestly
when we're benchmarking consoles for the
most part what you want is a flat line
that's not exciting but we do get that
and that's a good experience in a lot of
instances with apex legends so as we can
show on random gameplay clips that
Patrick took performance overall is
generally closer to the 60 FPS average
target the game is absolutely playable
on the Xbox 1x but the previous scenes
that raised some concerns for combat on
the lower end consoles we might branch
out into testing these if it's of
interest but we need to hear it in the
comments below so please sound off if
you have specific units you want us to
look at changing fov is the only real
graphics option on the console minimum
and default is 70 and maximum is 110
increasing our fov to the max just to
stress it didn't instantly tank
performance but frame rate during the
initial drop was a bit
during gameplay there were some
sustained periods of 33 milliseconds
spikes that we didn't see in our default
fov testing resultant of the expanded
viewable terrain some of the poorer
frame times we saw were during a fight
where an incendiary grenade was
detonated for example but the game still
didn't freeze up or a spike beyond 33
milliseconds except instances like this
where I'll just spike really hard and
suddenly and you have a very visible
frame drop for a fraction of a second
and that fraction is noticeable in play
as you can see in this clip repeated
respawn has been careful enough with its
resolution scaling that increasing F of
V M Xbox one X is a better experience
without a noticeable performance hit in
most instances capturing footage while
spectating didn't work out as well as
we'd hope we have some examples of that
so none of it was used for actual
analysis nothing we've talked about thus
far has been from spectating it's been
from gameplay spectate mode seems it
laggy and that's network lag not frame
lags that video out lag so we get some
of the classic source engine glitching
out of the map with falling under the
world or the appearance of the void and
if spectating is important to you it's
buggy to a point that the frame time
analysis isn't all that relevant we very
rarely saw any frame time spikes in
gameplay exiting spectator now above 33
point 3 milliseconds even the most
graphics intensive scenarios except for
some of those extremely heavy ones that
we showed so in those like the one with
the creeping barrage they're rare enough
that we can sort of write them off but
it's still important to be aware that
the heaviest firefights will still tank
framerate
it's just that hopefully they're not too
common and as long as everyone's on the
same hardware that's sort of fair from a
competitive standpoint but it's still
undesirable from an experienced and
point and that's bad since we record at
60fps to analyze console frame times
that 33 point 3 millisecond frame time
translates to one skipped frame the
smallest hitch that we can measure
considering that many modern console
titles are locked to 30fps and deliver
every frame thirty two point three
milliseconds apart apex Legends is doing
pretty well overall on average as you
can see in some of our less targeted or
intensive footage the game sticks pretty
close to sixteen point six seven
milliseconds or 60 FPS with occasional
spikes to thirty three point three and
those occasional spikes when it's just
one on that whole time bar at the bottom
you can ignore it that is not something
you will genuinely notice or at least
not most of the time it's typically when
you start seeing more frequent
deviations or excursions from the mean
that it becomes noticeable so it appears
that the dynamic resolution scaling is
largely responsible for the frame rate
recovery and heavier scenes and that
will wrap our apex legends xbox one I
expense mark for now part of our team is
flying out to Taiwan in China this week
but we'll be running more console
benchmarks at home base it's important
that you post the console testing
requests you have below and if you'd
like us to compare to some specific PC
configuration let us know that as well
we'll look at that in the coming weeks
otherwise get subscribe to the channel
to make sure you can catch our Taiwan
and China factory tours when we're
looking at some of the PC hardware
