by were Montreal can everybody hear us
in the back cool and i'm moderating this
panel inside story player participation
within narrative so first we're going to
do introductions of the panelists then
you can imagine the slides that we will
have and we will describe them and then
we're going to dive right in but we're
going to leave plenty of room for
questions at the end so the worried this
I'll tell you who I am my name is Dan
amigo I'm the creative director for
project untold which is a series of
visual novels I'm making in
collaboration with giant space cat out
of boston and i'm here to talk to you
guys about a back story hi I'm Jessie
school I am the creative design leave
for wizard101 family-friendly a memo hi
I'm a Malayan writer if I were montr√©al
I meet girl bonding or we fill in denial
for ebony entertainment as the store
eating major is my actual title of a
sensual am kind of her charterparty
story stuff slides it
yes so so this panel when we were trying
to decide what we were going to talk
about we realized that we didn't
understand ourselves what we meant by
some of these terms we were throwing
things around like emergent gameplay
versus emerged of storytelling we
decided that it would be very helpful if
we let you know what we meant and you
say those things so essentially what
we're talking about is making room in
the game for players to have their own
experiences and tell their own stories
and there's a couple different ways they
can do that obviously when we're talking
about emergent gameplay we're talking
about things like game mods any of you
guys seen the the cat apocalypse
grinding level 4 40 0 to 14 for girls to
you guys I am Laser cat right so that's
sort of an extreme example of that you
know it's just an achievement map that
people go into to grind but someone took
that idea and ran with it and created
this just insane godlike cat that shot
these out of its mouth and like sound
picking with lasers it was basically
unkillable it was absolutely memorable
you should look at the video if you
haven't seen it and that's that's the
extreme end of the emergent gameplay but
letting players do what they want with
the game and create their own content
that's loser cat I wish you could see
that picture it's gorgeous there's also
things like the home instances and mmos
in Skyrim for example you can collect
whatever you want there and some people
would chord cheese's or you know
different armor and completely fill
their rooms with it now if they had
decided that they were the cheese board
or they made up a whole story about that
that would be emergent storytelling but
just collecting the cheese
the emergent gameplay and the same thing
in gone home someone took every single
collectible in the game and gathered
them into one room why I don't know I
don't know what the purpose of that was
but that's how they chose to play that
game and so that would be again another
example of the emergent gameplay now in
terms of storytelling MMOs and RPGs do
this really well you know you have games
like guild wars 2 that let you pick your
own storyline at the very beginning and
you choose your profession your race or
whatever and then that sort of blocks
out a certain path for you in the game
you've already you know gotten rid of a
lot of content that you're not going to
see because of those initial choices and
bioware very famously has their
conversation system which influences
your relationships and your path to the
game so again these are ways that you
can tell your own story with a new
framework of the existing games yeah oh
yeah and journey this is a pretty much
it's really funny it's the snow and the
little journeyer is during the heart and
the snow at the end of the game sorry
spoiler and that's just a way that you
really can't communicate with people at
all in the game except through peeping
through these symbols then they gave you
this blank canvas at the end where you
can write whatever you want to
communicate with the other player and it
was a really thoughtful way to to allow
players at a little bit if their own
story within the game so that's what we
mean when we're talking about these
things and this is by no means a
comprehensive list is just to give you
an idea of where we're going to go with
us so just see what are some of the ways
that you either use
typically or you as a game designer
leave room in your game or aching in
four player stories you know I think a
lot of it is trying to remember you'll
keep foremost in mind that the players
action what they bring to it is what
makes the story live right what keeps us
different from other forms more passive
entertainment you know a lot of my work
the last few years has been in MMOs from
wizard101 to city of heroes and these
are games where in a lot of ways you
don't want to put the player as the
chosen one although to be fair it was
when we kind of do that but but it's
it's a game leads you know large player
spaces are games of many one and
recognizing that giving players kind of
some of some tools whether it some
character creation or large public
spaces gives them I think the sense of
empowerment a sense where they're able
to fill in their own kind of stories and
ideas to them to other characters and
when they are put in these shared spaces
in kind of public spaces other players
they want to kind of create these
stories together they want to kind of
tell each other about their characters
and that helps beginning that process
yeah so that process as you say it's
expensive in terms of development time
source and so on and you know since we
work for bio work maybe you can sit a
little bit about why does it matter why
do we do that what what do we get out of
it what is the player get out of having
this emergent space to play it I'm
speaking specifically for working on an
RPG because it really depends on the the
jar of game you're making and what the
tools you have our are we come at this
from an emeritus environment to start
with we also offer you know quick path
narrative we offer a lot of story about
squad maze to basically give you what
you have to play to get through the game
and then we add as much as we can that
is optional and most players will go and
explore and as soon as you hit
exploration or just letting people
determine how they want to interact with
the world that's where they start making
their own stories and it doesn't matter
we just had the top echelon and she was
talking about players personal
experiences will influence how they
perceive story and it doesn't matter how
you intend for things to be perceived as
soon as you put something there every
single player will bring a different
aspect to it and a different
interpretation to it so and that's the
richness of great because then after
that you get to talk to people about it
people exchange about their experience
and they may have played all the same
choices and come away with it with a
totally different impression of what was
going on what happened or how they felt
about it and that's where the richest I
comes in cool I'm just been a good at
more questions that everybody gets one
me just jump in so Mickey when we were
doing prep for this panel you said that
you would like to talk a little bit
about how remedies specifically you know
your experience there well how does the
development process and when the writer
comes into it like influence how much
emergent storytelling gets into a game
you speak a little bit about that sure
just together it wants it back briefly
one big difference between the kind of
thing we make it remedy and the kind of
games they make it quite work for
example is that we are mostly working on
like a line a linear kind of environment
or you know you go from A to B to C and
you can't really devious run a bath too
much but one of the things we try to do
is start to still make the world as
responsive as possible so even though
you or not you don't have that come to
explore you can't really affect the
outcome that much most of time we still
try to make sure that there is enough
room for you to kind of see 13 bits of
the road that may not be directly
relevant to the actual you know mission
your own at that given moment and the
way we kind of approach the thing is
right from the story this is a little
unusual I you know the sort of like
classic game development space that we
provide receipt right from the beginning
like there is no situation or label
design has just come up with a level by
themselves of any kind of court for
Natalie it's more like we're in a large
cases writers are kind of right in the
beginning of the pipeline and that means
that we are very much in demand an hour
bottle language but which is not a great
position to be but but and it makes
everything a little slower that's one
reason why our games that would usually
come up in just a couple years but yeah
like one thing that we really try to do
is create opportunities for players to
kind of put the death together there's a
lot of stuff that that is in direct
relevant what's happening and we try to
place as much content in the environment
as we possibly can and that may be
something to discover it might be
written text or it might be an audio
clip or it might be you know I seen that
place if you're all if you do is early
you know she bunch of things or
something like that but but but or
inquiries as I said something I see what
just you know there's like a pro the
puddle of water talks on wall and you
can figure out what that means if you
just take into clues but but that's
something that we kind of try to build
as careful as we can because otherwise
it's very easy for a leaner game to be
just about the character intro playing
and everything else in the world is just
kind of a variant thing set dressing and
that's not really something that you
want to have in a game like that if you
also want to communicate this idea of a
world that exists beyond the experience
that you're hardly having so that's
something that we've really spent a lot
of time on it that also means that we
iterate a lot and we're creating things
just keep going over the same things
over and over again at that that is very
slow but also every war ii want to be
actually hurt in college anyway so that
that means very well as the first free
for all questions everybody can pop in
fill up your game show host prizes
there's always prizes when I moderate
pens so you talked about linear
narrative I does giving the player space
to make their own stories does that
detract from the story you're trying to
to sell to tell two players like is
their attention there and you know it's
a secondary when is it useful to have a
story on rails so to speak and insert
away some of that narrative space the
players that players can create well I
think for us it's I mean all of our
games are you know they're even named
after the protagonist like you get Max
Payne or you get Alan Wake and they're
very much about a specific person in a
specific situation and it's not really
the kind of thing where you're but we're
not trying to let you create your own
adventure rather trying to construct an
adventure that is as cool as we can
possibly making that kind of take you on
this very you know well crafted right
and the Guru thing about that is that
that we can control the experience and
then we can really we can time things
the way we want to time gonna make sure
that you really get the you know the
optimized version of that experience
which is very cool but but it does mean
that some things like replay value kind
of aren't necessarily require too much I
mean there are people watch movies over
and over again and then there are people
who play your games or Korean for most
people I think it's a continued play to
it once and then you had that experience
whereas something like I think we do
lose something in in the whole thing
we're in say Mass Effect you may want to
play us you know the asshole Shepherd or
the sort of you know pure-hearted
Shepherd and you get very different
experiences I mean the sort of grand
story is pretty much the same but but
the wake unfolds very different and
that's that there's a lot of value that
I think one of the downsides
of that approaches that you also need a
lot of people creating a lot of content
and in terms of macgruber remedy is a
fairly small studio oh yeah i think
around 131 employees at this point and
add that further very linked it so how
much contact we can actually creating a
game and i think that's something that
now that we are bigger to be used to be
we made em awake with run 50 60 people
and that was much more ok no we're good
want to break we actually do have more
branching country there just because we
have more people working on the content
so you do get a little bit more in the
way so above or better I know like
affecting the experience but i but i
think still for us it's something that
we we kind of want to see on the range
of the experience like we don't go that
much for your kind of thing really if
never observed like a create your own
story of anything with us natalie is not
yet although we have it but that sort of
thing to quite a bit so so for us for
wizard101 pyro one the replayability
comes from not the linear story which
had certain chapter breaks until we're
able to get more content but it's from
that shared space with the multiplayers
right and so some of that starts going
to in-game where people find their own
things to do they may hang out in the
pet shop and they don't know yet how to
patch a pet so somebody more experienced
player comes along and it kinda walks
them through it and then often
friendships that kind of formed out of
these things you know and then it
expands i think like city of heroes at
the kind of its height did a ton of
user-created content where people could
write their own missions and that kind
of build that and that's you know very
much a way of doing it but even before
that happened you know players got so
into it you know good friend of mine who
is a very experienced writer and he
would go out his way to write basically
city of heroes fiction for us to publish
you know and he did some great superhero
stuff with that and then I think you go
even beyond that instead of filling up
the downtime replayability and you these
connections become with real-life
connections with people is calm you know
hang out
their guild mates to people who you know
I've heard stories people who I guess
was in EverQuest they spent so long
doing the same kind of nitrogen raid you
know over and over camping that they
became not just good friends but they
became a romantic relationship I mean
it's it's a difference or storytelling
but it all kind of has these groups of
what do you bring to this game what do
you bring to this play space how is it
in rich in your life and nothing that
goes also to the you know it's expensive
why do we do it well you know from the
kind of bean counter perspective the
more people engage with your game and
and kind of tie into it you know the
more they're willing to spend on it
right and as game designers and
storytellers the more you know they kind
of fall in love with your world and
characters and you have this kind of
cool shared experience with them the
other downsides
aight having the emergence space to
having the emergence pacers haven't
loved rails well I are again I wouldn't
when the game is on wheels and you know
you are just following one character
through the story it's a tough sell
sometimes if the characters are likable
like we have that I've worked on a game
called Murder soul suspect and everyone
he needed appertain character I mean he
was a real jerk and he swore a lot he
was a bad person it was all about his
redemption in the afterlife and he in
hourly focus testing people just
despised him I mean he was dressed in
like a fedora and investors do not home
hella gave a douchebag and you know if
it's a really unfortunate and so we had
to do a lot more we had to change his
lines way to take out some of those
where and we had to do a lot of stuff to
make it like a fool because that
impression is what people were going to
have to live with route the game and
they weren't bringing anything to run to
and they were just following his story
and if they didn't care about his story
then you know they're does the entire
game so that would be the downside to
the rails um actually a counterpoint to
that like this is going to be Skyrim
yeah I guess Skyrim I played at one
percent of the crib and I just feared
and went right off into the wilderness
that's where i spent about 50 hours i
have to go back to the creek that i
didn't care about it but I was having
tons of fun in the game yeah but there
are there people where you get that
friction we're laughing shadows are more
which does really really cool stuff on
the kind of emergent gameplay kind of
crashes into the narrative and there's
certain points where it says no we're
going to drag you back onto this and I
can get why that is done from you know
the design perspective I know people who
that's turn them off of it wait no i
don't i don't care about that story I
want to do my oh damn I have to do that
he hit the next level up ok screw it i'm
done i'm going to choose something else
if there's a one thing we have a valid
way of course that
character is engine take it in sport I
mean listen to who he's had a lot of
personal troubles he's got substance
abuse issues and things like that and
he's trying to get better but he's not
bitter yet and that's something that
that was really interval to the story is
a guy who is this darkness inside him
and they look as many physically in the
real world around him and it's more
complicated than that but that's kind of
the core of you in some ways and that is
something that there was a lot of
concern about before we actually came up
where is this guy too much of an ass on
this is kind of before today so pretty
bad or shows like that cell so you know
the idea of a very protagonist who is
not necessarily that likable but it's
still relatable it is something that
that wasn't that well sort of
established it at that point um but I
remember there were things like you know
I think Eurogamer did this compilation
or two minute video just that that just
called out babysitting it slightly
different moments where he just goes
around just shouting at people who try
to help you more or you will get
conversation like
no impulse control and just you know
things like that but at the same time so
something that I think gave me a lot of
its character and it's something that
that our people have enjoyed about it I
mean there are people who don't
necessarily like the character that much
but they like to see what he becomes or
and they like to see how he you know I
got sort of the moments of I don't know
an alignment that he has every once in a
while not just like always strong to be
a better person and that's something
that I think changes a little bit like
when you're watching somebody do that
passively like you're on a TV show it's
a little easier to see them do horrible
things because like nobody really wants
to be Walter White I think like that
that these pretty much like the worst
person you can imagine and if you
actually have be like that changes
things for people a little bit and
that's something that is a little bit
difficult for some people to try to kind
of accept that just looking now I'm not
a good person and now I have to do with
these horrible things I'm granted like
Alan way doesn't do a fraction of the
horrible things that met Walter White
does so each other with easier but but I
think that that's kind of something I
would like to play somebody who is like
utterly morally compromised and he's
just not capable of handling I
always just gotta scramble to get by I
think that's interesting is something
that when you do that in an interactive
environment I think it's something that
that you can even if you don't really
explore the focus of that eat something
that for a player easily in their head
kind of spins into something much larger
and I got
little things that they do that don't
let the game doesn't really acknowledge
in any way kind of easily turn into like
a large narrative in the inside player
can say hey like about how much more
horrible person / I think that's
something you can do for example in
Skyrim for you can do all sorts of
horrible things if you're playing like
like character is not nice the game
doesn't really understand that you're
doing them like the idea that you're
taking I'd say shoplifting cheese from a
poor man like I'm sorry not a pig
binding cheese from poor manage is
throwing in the world just your 12
cheese but you don't want the other back
to have a tiger and the game doesn't
understand what you're doing but you do
and then it just going ok now I'm a
horrible person yay and that's something
that that a lot of games that aren't
really designed to act on anyway
laws but still have a lot of
opportunities for that like I know
people who work played like gauge where
they just want to get asshole then they
just go and shoot out the windows of
what give you some people that that's
going to cost you a thousand bucks yeah
I think that as people create
interactive experiences it is given that
no matter how much we try to put the
experience on Rails it's just not going
to stay that way when you're writing a
novel we are in charge of the whole
experience right up until the point
where you that goes up the door even at
that point it's no longer your own
because other people's interpretations
and your audience's interpretation is
going to come into the midst when we're
doing games we're trying to generate
emotional investment from people or
trying to create emotions that people
will feel and we can't control what
those reactions emotions
so while we're creating the experience
we can try to codify it and say hey this
is a story on Rails this is what we want
you to experience we just can't force
people to do that which is why the
skyrim is a great example of it's like
yeah there's a crit path somewhere over
there but everyone just goes and do what
they want when we're doing RPGs we have
these you know these these complex
narrative for crit paths but we always
make a point of adding a lot around it
till now players the room to make the
experience their own and I think as long
as we have created a space where someone
can just either go through experience
and invest in it the way we meant for
them to do or find a room to putter in
and collect cheese and be happy we've
done our job done something good there's
also headcanon like somebody can have
the exact same choices through for
example mass effect I did everything
that my friend did but we had completely
different experiences because it like
that this is what my shepherd was like
yeah it's basically you know as writers
we go this is what we meant for it to be
yeah but we can't tell people so this is
how you have to interpret it we have to
allow for them to go no this is what I
see in this character so say you wrote a
straight character and some goats going
to that characters totally in the closet
awesome that's what you're seeing like
it no my personal preferences right of
students to go as long as you're
punching up not down when you're doing
those interpretations applause but i
can't even dictate that stricter and
also you know fanfiction I was just
telling this point like so how do we
feel about fan transmedia
I've been fiction deviant art etc I mean
does that does do any of you let go out
and find that get examples from and
think like oh that's how they interpret
the character interesting I'll remember
that for the next time or do we avoid it
I'm going to be a link we jump right out
there start of a fanfiction long before
I became a professional camera I think
it's awesome I think it's absolutely
awesome i avoid everything related to
the i pan working on for legal reasons
yes you can't go in there i'll look at
fan art that's okay but all of the
writing i just have you stay away from
it and that's it i love talking with
players about their experiences in their
head canon i love seeing would they care
about and i will go and look at the
fanfiction of other IPS because yes it's
so cool and there's a lot of there's a
social you know looked down on the nose
of fanfiction under the impression that
it's bad it's not true they're really
excellent writers in the world fan
fiction and you're missing out if you're
not checking it out yeah listen go to
everything to mind the good stuff let's
just remember Jim Butcher started as a
writer and floristic there's a lot I
guess I declare do we know the Laurel as
the unint inheritance of Gant fiction
here she would tell us yeah so I mean
what about the rest of you I project
untold has its roots in the fan fiction
in our community I went and I sought out
these communities to see what they were
doing and I found them what they were
they were creating spaces for themselves
within these
that we're boring them largely so they
would play a game and there weren't any
you know clear characters or characters
of color in it so they were going off
and writing their own stories and
creating their own art sometimes
manipulating videos and stuff to make
that game world in that game story what
they wanted it to be and I found some
really interesting like some communities
that were being exploited in some ways
like you'll be talking about kpop
sometimes but that is that is a an
industry that understands how to use its
bands I mean they have them you know
watching a video 5 million times and all
the fans get out of that is you know an
extra 30 seconds of footage of their
favorite idols but the company gives
endorsements and money and awards from
YouTube and stuff like that and it's a
huge money making thing for them to
channel this power of the bands and so I
was looking at that and trying to think
how I could take that creativity and
energy that these people had is this
need to tell their own stories and what
could we do with that and that's how
untold with for more like we need to get
these people writing their own stories
and to give them the tools to do that
and so that's what it's all about so I'm
one hundred percent in favor of the in
fiction I think it's a great way to get
you know players engaged and you know
into your ear game and your space as I
said you know with city of heroes we
would solicited stories four players and
we would take the best and publish them
either in the city or s comic or on our
website with with wizard it's much less
of that again partly for the idea of one
any kind of you know for legal reasons
in it and not be too tired taken off the
path of what we're trying to do but but
it also kind of I think one way branches
out into YouTube streamers and you know
I never had a real sense of how i could
watch people play our games before and
now you know I'll watch a couple than
when we release like a big chap urn and
you know they're not being sort of a
serious into the story and yet it's
still really cool when they like hit a
moment that's cool too mechanical
and they respond to it you know whose or
prior oh my god I can't believe that guy
or whatever but it's a really
fascinating way of actually seeing
people take our stuff and how that's
being experienced people to have a
witness at almost firsthand I'm kind of
conflicted about fanfic in general I I
wrote from started fabric when I was
like 15 or 16 so I environment I have
fired at my own sort of penance for that
though but like he's like I always have
this envelope if you guys are into the
running order to write something that's
your own stuff and at the same time if
somebody were to come to me like i do
want to write like 10 issues of Batman
applause yes dot yes hurry that
differently I need something like Batman
is my character what if anything we're
even if I got that chance like nobody
would imagine that over now is like that
gets back Malik so I don't know I like I
did it a bunch of stuff said to me every
once in a while on what people said me
fanfic and stuff like that it's a little
bit different for me because you know
just feeling Jersey special education
happy so I can look at that stuff and
not but it immediately source you don't
believe you but um it's it's it's kind
of weird for me because I I'm kind of
ain't all about what consistency and
then just like you know the canon of all
things especially when something that
I'm working on so so it always just like
roads that we're cognitive dissonance in
view if I see something like that also a
lot of porn
30 forest is what effect if it's at all
so it's interesting on how far some
people like they haven't this internal
idea of what these characters where you
are for example wake has his best friend
a friend who is this like annoying dude
named Barry and and he you know but and
also I waves on this mission to kind of
like like figuring out what happened to
his wife and that's kind of what the
only thing that really motivated me is
just kind of fixing slips away Gettys
know what what marriage back together
let's god that's kind of the row of it
and saying I get these people were
absolutely no he's gay don't we do we
get thank you okay there's not a lot you
can say that's like it doesn't take
anything away from me but it kind of
feels like you're maybe ignoring like
eighty percent of the character's
motivation here so we got a question
from the hashtag and this will be our
last before we open up Q&amp;amp;A so spare
tickets so thank you to gamers Nexus how
do you facilitate a player's decision to
deviate from plot without detracting
from the quote above core experience so
how do you have you facilitate that and
still get the core the core story out to
players I don't know that you can
control that I mean it's like what they
were saying you have the critical path
in there and they can choose to take it
or not I mean I guess you could you
could strip away everything but that and
like channel them down but I think even
in that case players are still going to
play the game they want to play and get
with a one out of it things like
environmental clues like you guys were
discussing I got no a guild wars 2 there
were a lot of areas that we set up very
deliberately with just sort of a
sketched in scene
had to sort of fill in the details
yourself and we would see people
role-playing never lie like you find
like a grave with an inscription on it
as someone weeping nearby and you know
just enough to let you could form your
own conclusion and people would do that
all the time and those were just sort of
deliberate set pieces for role playing
so that's that's one thing you can do I
think it really depends on those aren't
game you're reading but speaking from
our beauties India is pretty no example
of that where there's a crit path there
are certain throttle points where you're
forced back into manera but other than
mine you can explore as long as you want
there's a reason why at the start with
ti amo well you know everyone I've ever
seen get out of the hinterlands it's be
able to brush their right and that's a
lot of port that's you just allow for
people to explore and then eventually go
back to the crib path that that's when
you take over sometimes but that's I'd a
badge do what you want and we're quite
there yet in some ways I think some
games like a crow fall which I don't
know if you guys know about it's an
upcoming Kickstarter thing out of Austin
may have something that plays in lad I'm
in there their idea is that you have a
persistent character these eternal
heroes but the worlds that will die they
will you know and you'll have to kind of
come back into a new world so they're
doing a lot of territorial stuff a lot
of you know you stake out your claims
and you're trying to make yourself the
biggest toughest guilt you know on the
world but then the world's going to blow
up and you have to start over again and
you're able to take some of your
experience you know forward and I adding
things that are more sandboxie obviously
give you that chance but any time
there's just a strong narrative sorry
there to the blood game goes on extra
cultural generations which is based on
that constant right you basically each
generation you get to take some stuff
with you to the next generation but you
basically decide where you take that to
you at and play to get I can get to be
relieved smaller here I like to say
real glad to see this for us it's kinda
different we normally do open road stuff
and the reason we don't do it was
actually supposed to be a noble title
the beginning and the reason we made it
linear was mostly just that we wanted to
do something that was like a tennis
trailer kind of thing and it's run in
order to maintain that if the player can
just wander off the path you know the
kind of things were you know picking
leprechauns you like we're going to kill
your wife you don't show up with that
you know this pot at the night midnight
and then okay but I'm going to go
fishing okay and of course lucky there
we can't actually do the thing where you
know the kidnapper falls to on that
because there is I mean damages go back
to check one or something and that's a
thought of fun for anybody so it or you
can do things like let's say that you
have like like like a secret meeting you
were supposed to be really quiet and
everything is going to be like on the
down low and then you show for a meeting
in a monster truck which is something
you can do in an open ball game and if
you know it's something you just can
roll with but what if you're really
trying to do something that is really
really tight to taste and really
atmospheric it just kind of you know
just concentrating on whatever momentum
players in at the moment then you do
lose our freedom so for us most of time
if the player doesn't want to follow
along on the story that pretty much
means that they are and just going along
the path at all I'd like there to stay
in that room or maybe going you know
backtracking to a certain point but if
they keep going to the only against
place that's really available them and
sometimes we do gotta make that wider
but it never gets so wide that that you
can kind of see the other edge of the
path so to speak it's very different for
us so but we kind of fail the player
that's what I guess sorry they know
they're getting it issued I'm afraid
we're out of time but we will stick
around
answer more questions um so thank you
