pretty unique for a few reasons one of
them is that it has 1440p benchmarks the
utility does not officially include the
1440p resolution but you can make it
work through command-line we use
scripted automation for all this testing
so it should be pretty damn consistent
and accurate run to run it's all done by
automation so no real room for error
there we studied the game completely for
the benchmark portion to understand what
we were testing I have a separate video
on that we have a graphics analysis in
this video that talks about specific
graphics techniques that the technical
artists used to help all of us
understand why this game is as taxing of
GPU hardware as it is and then final two
unique points we have a Titan V in here
just because why not it's been a month
since we saw it and also I'm gonna
occasionally refer to it as Final
Fantasy XV just to annoy you all before
that this video is brought to you by
thermal Grizzly makers of the conductor
not liquid metal that we recently used
to drop 20 degrees off of our
temperatures thermal grizzly also makes
traditional thermal compounds we use on
top of the IHS like cryo not and hydro
not pastes learn more at the link below
so let's start this out by talking about
what they're doing with the benchmark
benchmark is only three point seven
gigabytes it doesn't contain the whole
game it's not fully representative of
the entire game however it's six minutes
long and it takes huge portions of the
game in the open world environment so we
actually get a really good look
condensed at the entire game as a whole
despite it not being necessarily fully
representative everything in the game
this means we can analyze the graphics
quality because it's actually really
damn demanding and the visuals of the
game are pretty impressive so you look
at things like the metallic paint where
you can see paint specs and one of the
car paint jobs it's actually pretty cool
stuff and we'll talk about more of that
in a minute before getting to that
there's some information as well on the
benchmark specifically how Square Square
Enix is uploading the data from I don't
know if it's aggregate data from users
or how they're collecting it but
basically there is some form of
aggregate pooled data on their website
and depending on how you test your
device there could potentially be some
poisoning of data there because it's not
necessarily fully controlled those tests
could be run on various configurations
with various CPUs for example which
would skew the results so we are running
the test in a controlled fashion and we
also have 1440p benchmarks in here just
to give a bit of an extra but let's move
into some of the first major items that
we notice with performs a quick note
confirmation was received from Square
Enix on the settings we talked about
this in a previous content beast where
we were uncertain if the graphics
settings were the same between high
medium and low across all resolutions
Square Enix did confirm for us that the
graphics quality settings remain the
same across all resolutions so the very
first thing to point out is that you're
gonna see interesting significant
differences between AMD and NVIDIA and
the GPU charts and this is particularly
at high and medium settings you'll also
see differences between same brand
devices across these two settings so
this is partly because of the frame time
variance that we can pull up a chart now
that shows the frame times of an Nvidia
card at high and medium using the
settings shown in the chart we're using
an Nvidia card here because this is a
game works game and Nvidia's had the
most access to it presumably so to show
that they have frame time variants
reveals that the game doesn't run
perfectly even on nvidia hardware who
have optimized for it the most because
it is using game works options so frame
time variants here is far greater with
high settings and frame to frame
intervals become looser and more
stuttered this causes visible hitching
so to speak during gameplay and exists
even on 1080 T eyes it's particularly
bad during the first run of a benchmark
but is ever-present with high settings
moving to medium largely removes the
issue as shown in the frame time plot
despite being an Nvidia supported title
both Nvidia and AMD suffer in the frame
time Department specifically with high
settings so as we go through the
benchmark charts keep a close eye on
Vega 56 and Vega 64 positioning relative
to each other at high and medium let's
get into some of the graphics analysis
of
the six minutes of the benchmark shows
us and why those six minutes are so
taxing one of the most immediate and
important items to point out is the
tessellation in the game so between Andy
and Nvidia they both handle geometry
differently Andy has expanded its
geometry pipe in recent years but NVIDIA
maintains an advantage in dealing with
heavy tessellation something that's been
true since the crisis days at fifteen
seconds into the benchmark we noticed
that Square Enix used a heavy amount of
tessellation in the ground and terrain
rather than using a traditional normal
map for the ground
this adds perceived depth to the surface
by allowing displacement to increase
apparent detail via tessellation and
tessellation is basically a doubling of
the triangles on the graphics hardware
so four becomes eight and so on
this makes the service seem higher
resolution and it's also why we get the
added bumps a few of which we can
highlight in the video production the
card doesn't conform to the surface from
what we can tell but it's more
geometrically complex of a surface and
it makes it more interesting to look at
the actual value however is debatable
geometric complexity like this cost a
lot and if your device and the or Nvidia
is struggling with heavy tessellation
we'd assume you'd be able to separately
disable this in the final game there are
also options in the driver settings that
where you can tune this down
interestingly at three minutes 58 in the
video it appears that the ground is no
longer tessellated we think that Square
Enix has switched to a traditional
normal map here we're not sure if this
is because it's a known combat scene
with a lot of other complex elements to
render or if it's for some other reason
let's rewind to some other impactful
settings at 27 seconds into the
benchmark we noticed some high quality
reflection techniques being used by
Square Enix on the car the door and the
mirrors of the truck are dynamically
reflecting the environment we don't
think these are using screen space
reflections because you can see clouds
and other background elements
dynamically reflected in those services
at 50 seconds we notice that the trees
are using flat alpha textures instead of
particles or some sort of game works
plugin this is a bit of a primitive way
to do things but as cheap in terms of
resource cost five seconds later we pass
a truck with extremely detailed textures
as seen on the front of the vehicle
and this is a major contributor to vram
consumption that penalize is for
gigabyte GPUs as you'll see in the
charts and a bit there are high quality
textures in this game there's also some
motion blur going on and we further
noticed that the truck leaves behind
some ghosted lines that slowly fade
something we saw again at three minutes
four seconds where the fishing pole
leaves similar ghosted lines at 56
seconds just after the truck you can see
some highly noticeable limited shadow
draw distance poppin in the background
where the environment elements and the
shadows are getting drawn as we approach
them at 1 minute 54 the chocobos are
using traditional alpha textures for fur
as opposed to hair works or other game
works effects which we know are bundled
in because they used on character model
hair for the main characters the tail
feathers do use some sort of advanced
physics calculations when the chocobo
runs or moves but nothing special for
the fur as far as we can see at 2
minutes you can see soft shadows cast by
trees and it's noticeable by the way the
shadows soften as the leaves get further
from the ground as opposed to the base
of the tree that's closer to the ground
and uses a harder shadow this might be
part of Nvidia's frustum traced shadows
but it could also just be an older soft
shadow technique at 2 minutes 33 seconds
there's a great example of screen space
reflections if you don't know what that
is you will now we can demonstrate this
by looking at the tree leaf that
includes the background mountains the
game is using that screen space to
calculate reflections of the mountains
onto the lake but the occlusion results
in missing information in screen space
so the reflection is inaccurate and
incomplete and you get that weird
reflection effect on the lake the
alternative to this would be planar
reflections but the hardware cost is too
great to use in most real-time scenarios
3 minutes 53 seconds is also an
interesting scene as Noctis warps across
the screen we can see the background
bridge refracting and noctis's mesh
similar to what you'd see with a straw
in a glass of water for instance this is
another advanced rendering technique
that has some physical hardware cost to
it will cut that there but keep an eye
out for our full graphics analysis
coming soon
subscribe for that we're trying to do
more of them for now though we've
established
why the game is as graphically intensive
as it is and why it's so taxing on the
hardware let's get into the charts as
always you can check the article link in
the description below for more
information on this and for the bench
platform our 1080p high chart will start
us off as that's likely what most of you
are interested in the Titan V has some
immediate difficulty with the lows here
more than the other devices but it's
also not really something we're
expecting anyone else to use to play
games we just threw it in because we had
it moving on to actual gaming cards
everything up from the Vega cards and up
do reasonably well and averages but the
frame time hit at high settings
introduces occasional stutters or lawn
intervals between frames we showed those
frame time plots earlier this is the
real impact of that this impacts AMD and
NVIDIA alike
though AMD does take a bigger hit as
illustrated on Vega versus these 0.1%
lows of the neighboring 1070 and 1062
we're talking 9 FPS versus 15 FPS 4.1
percent lows so it's not really a major
victory for NVIDIA nothing to brag about
at this point what we really need is the
ability to custom tune settings so that
we can find out which one is tanking the
frame time performance and causing those
long frame to frame intervals until the
game launches though we won't have that
so we want to 1080p medium next this
settings configuration would be ideal
for something like a gtx 1066 gigabyte
card with the RX 500 series high-end not
doing too poorly here either you can use
either and probably be happy with it
especially once you can actually tune
the settings manually vegam 56 does
reasonably well despite its frame time
consistency and manages a 77 FPS average
the card is still outperformed by the 10
70 by about nine point seven percent but
we'll see if a.m. these future updates
do anything to help with this before
getting into 1440p we also ran a few
low-end devices at 1080p low settings
results are on the screen now the 1060
predictably leads managing 80 FPS at low
and this device can handle medium
settings fine so no surprise here the RX
574 gigabyte card is struggling in the
frame time Department once again but
manages a FPS average respectively the
1050 Ti places similarly to the AR
five seventy both at about forty nine
FPS average the RX at five sixty 16 a Cu
card the original one that was shipped
not the later ones with 14c use is about
10 FPS behind the 1050 TI OC it's not
actually overclocked MSI just calls it
that it's one of the cheapest 1050 T is
1440p benchmarks are something we're
proud to someone uniquely offer because
we scripted our tests and automated them
so we're able to force the games we run
at resolutions not included in the built
in benchmark that includes 1440p at
1440p high settings obviously without
the ability to customize the options the
gtx 1080i exceeds 60 FPS average and
manages to hit 72 FPS throughout the
lows at about 49 and 22 fps looked
better than previously but 22 is still
dismal when compared to 72 as your
average this is a problem with the high
settings primarily the 0.1% low values
here are still suffering this is
repeatable on all devices when tested
with high settings for the graphics
although the average framerate may still
be 72 FPS you'll see visible stutters
and hitches on occasion particularly
when loading a new area for the first
time at that boot or in the first time
in a while we'll need to wait for the
final game to see if this gets ironed
out the 1080i leads the 1080 by 28% with
a gtx 1080i operating at 56 FPS average
with similarly painful frame times the
GTX 1080 leads the next card
the 1070 TI by 11.8% and there's enough
of a gap here that overclocking could
more or less close it even when I also
overclocking the 1080 the GTX 1070
manages a 46 FPS average with the Vega
64 Strix card operating a 39 FPS average
pay close attention here to Vega 56 64
and the gtx 1070 right now the 1070 is
leading even vega 64 which probably
shouldn't be the case but as we move on
to 1440p medium you'll see what's going
on so here's where it gets interesting
then at 1440p high to recap the 10 does
have any leads at vega 64 by a sizable
16.5% and it leads its direct Vega 56
competitor by 30%
that's absolutely massive considering
the
are much closer together in other
benchmark titles and at Vega 56 often
even outpaces the 1070 in like-for-like
testing at 1440p medium things change
the gtx 1070 now runs at 60fps average
with the vega 64 cards surpassing it at
63 FPS average they give 56 still trails
at 55 but previously we were about 30%
ahead with the 1070 over vagin 56 and
with medium settings from high the 1070
is now just 7.3 percent ahead of Vega 56
that's a big reduction as predicted in
our pretest video the gap was closed
almost entirely by dropping a couple of
settings potentially gameworks options
for which a and he hasn't yet optimized
because medium disables all game works
options that would explain a lot here it
could also just be general tessellation
and LOD or view distance settings which
would feed a lot of geometry and
primitives to a card that has
historically compared to its competition
struggled a little bit more with both
still the 1070 TI leads both of Vega
devices and both Vega devices still
struggle on the frame time front here's
a plot of the 1070 T is at frame x for
the medium runs mapped up against Vega
64 s frame x additional spike eNOS and
the AMD card presents itself in this
testing we'll have to wait and see if
Andy's Final Fantasy XV driver is
released later closer to the game's
launch will fix any of this and he has
told us they're not planning to release
drivers for this benchmark today but
they'll address it once there's a real
game to address at 4k high settings the
gtx 1080i operates an average FPS of 46
with lows at 27 and 1212 pretty pretty
bad
again this frame time deviation is
derived specifically from the high
settings until a point at which we can
manually toggle those settings we can't
say for sure what specific options are
causing that behavior
none of these devices are particularly
well equipped for Final Fantasy 15 at 4k
high in its present state but full
graphics customization options should
help the Titan VIII for what it's worth
operates the highest average by about
21% but it also has worse frame time
consistency a lot worse and it's to a
point of being actually noticeable in
gameplay I'd rather have one of the
lower end devices with higher 0.1% lows
to play this game than the Titan v4 4k
medium settings the GT X 1080 Ti
struggled to maintain its 52 FPS average
with 1% lows dipping down to 41 FPS
frame times aren't as much of a concern
here as they are with high settings as
illustrated by the close proximity
between the 1% and point 1% lows and all
tested devices except for the r9 fury X
which has two times worse 99.9% I'll
frame time values the GT x 1080
predictably lands second but it's a
shallow victory 40 FPS average
marking the 1080i about 34% ahead of the
1080
the RX Vegas 64 Strix card puts in a
good run with its 36 FPS average
comparatively led by the 1080 by about
8% dollar-for-dollar assuming GPU prices
were a thin anyone abided by that would
be a direct comparison low-end frame
time performance is a bit worse on the
Vegas 64 card but this game isn't
particularly 4k friendly anyway the fury
X isn't too far back from Vegas 64 and
average FPS but drops the ball with 0.1%
little values this is probably at least
in part due to the frame buffer size
because you can look at the game see the
texture sizes and generally assume that
it's using a lot of memory so over the
conclusion there's a lot more that could
be said here we'll try and outline some
of it in the article below that said
those testings been going on for 13
hours at this point I think so actually
more than that so it's been a long day
of testing we have lots of content on
the website and on the channel already
if I've left something out sorry
we'll get to it eventually but it's I
mean it's it's 4:30 a.m. cut me cut me
some slack so we've been testing since
the benchmark came out we have several
articles on the site we also have CPUs
to go still and we started that testing
just need to finalize it if you feel
like there's something really specific
that you'd like us to look at for CPUs
you still have some time to get that
request in because we are still working
on getting the benchmarks going got the
methodology figured out
need to get the tests running so that's
it for now subscribe for more make sure
you catch our graphics analysis and CPU
coverage and as always good at
