now I can't be taxed 2019 and Thoreau
will take we're gonna start with this
which is district plates they seem like
they've been kind of hot last couple
months but the manufacturers have been
catching up to the interest and thermal
tanks along the leading edge with we saw
one from fan tax as well so we talked
about district plates we've got a level
twenty HT massive aquarium type case to
look at and then a secret project
they'll be looking at in here somewhere
which is going to be a combined aao or
CLC if you prefer pulling the CPU and
the memory so that'll be a bit unique
we'll look at that in this video as well
before that this video is brought to you
by Corsair as an iron claw RGB wireless
gaming mouse the corsair iron claw
focuses first on comfort with its palm
grip approach and also uses a sub 1
millisecond wireless connection for the
PC you can toggle between Wireless and
Bluetooth connectivity making it easy to
control multiple pcs with one mouse like
a stream and PC and a gaming PC the
mouse has 10 programmable buttons the
pmw 30 391 18,000 DPI sensor 3 zone RGB
LEDs and fifty million click lifespan
for left and right mouse buttons learn
more at the link in the description
below the sort of the district plate
snow since we're already here so a
distro plate or a distribution plate is
used for water cooling systems likely a
lot of you saw them for the first time
when we looked at the Lian leo Levin
dynamic but at the time it wasn't an
actual product you could buy it was just
like a for show only fancy build and it
was a plate that ek made and then ek
made that plate but only available to
people who bought a full system from
them so they've been difficult to get
but have grown in popularity over the
last year so district plates been around
a while it's not like it's a brand new
thing but they're finally becoming like
more retail mainstream options for the
year or for towards the end of the year
anyway these are looking at potentially
an August launch prices are TBD don't
know our price yet the DB 200 is the
larger one DP one hundreds of smaller
one they have a couple of hookups each
so on this one there's two quarter inch
fitting hookups under the pump the pumps
mounted to the to the acrylic block and
then on the other side of it there's
just a fill on a drain if you want those
the larger ones got the same format
right now or it's got two sort of inputs
on this side of the system
we'll have b-roll of and then on the
back there's the the fill and drain as
well so what Thermaltake needs to hear
from you is if you're interested in this
type of solution like a distro plate
what do you want to see changed on it
because it's at a point right now where
if you make a suggestion or a request
you might actually be able to to get
your feedback heard by thermal things so
there's like there's an opportunity here
to pass some feedback along and it's the
same for all these companies have this
show a lot of them are prototypes but
anyway ultimately there's a couple
things you can do with the district late
that are unique and a lot of them are
going to have to do with like do they
fit in the different cases or how many
holes do they have is it like the fans
x1 where you feed it like six different
tubes and then you kind of distribute
the the flow changes a bit the pressure
changes but it looks kind of cool but
it's got more compatibility it's a
really difficult market to get into this
what solves a lot of that by just being
literally a case sort of I mean you can
mount the motherboard a power supply and
everything else to it
it doesn't have like glass although they
were talking about the option of a glass
panel in front of it let them know if
you want something like a p5 style panel
in front but yeah it's just a big giant
basically mounting plate with water flow
through it I think that's all we know
about the DP 200 it might be called DV
200 plus but you have Front has to
poorest train and fill in the back and
then there's a PCB LED strip on the top
and the bottom and it's a PCB not not
just like flimsy strips so that might
get like a diffuser in the future
they're not sure yeah they're still
finalizing stuff one plug hookup up here
for power and I think that covers the
db2 on a DB 100 is the smaller one it's
a three sixty millimeter radiator size
so it should be standard 360 rad
compatible which is good because the
district plates do have issues with
compatibility a lot of time about 360 if
your case fits a 360 as long as you're
good on the the thickness of it then it
should fit and still no price on this
one maybe August for the launch
it's a DD C pump which is also on the
larger one and this one has
as mentioned that the same count of
holes available one thing that they're
all take is a little concerned about is
people stripping out the holes so a
solution to that is like an aluminum
plate on the flat the the backward so
you got the black plate here that does
give you more screw holes that aren't
acrylic so should be a bit more reusable
but you've got the aesthetic potential
downside so that's another area where
you can provide feedback on what you
think of it you know would you rather
just trust yourself to not strip the
holes and get rid of the plate or do you
want it to be more guaranteed future
proof for for multiple uses another PCB
strip on the top with LEDs and then that
pretty much covers it so the next thing
we're looking at is this this is a
hundred percent prototype it is not
ready for market doesn't even have a
name so let's just start there when
companies show prototypes like this that
shows it's always nice because we do get
to see some cool stuff that is either
really early in the process might not
make it to market or might make its
market like a year or something so let's
let's walk through it and see what
they've done so far what I recognize is
a flow cooler so thermal tanks got like
the flow 360 line there's a flow 360 or
a modified one anyway and flow the flow
series is made by a stack it's used to
be a gentle four point five pump for
example it's a higher rpm pump but
what's actually interesting here is that
the tubes are running from the rad into
the pump itself and as you would expect
them then cut so this one would be the
return line so it's cut it goes into the
memory so it's an AI o or a CLC for the
CPU and for the RAM which is interesting
and feeds into the water Ram thing that
Thermaltake was talking about at CES
earlier this year so anyway yeah cuts
into the ram there's a block on top of
it the heat sinks are in theory or the
plan is to sell the heat sinks with the
block and then you can mount it to your
own kit if you want right now it's the
thermaltake branded memory so it's 32
gigabytes in here thirty-two hundred
megahertz at present there was a test
running earlier we have b-roll of where
the temperatures were like in the 30s or
so degrees Celsius for the memory but
anyway water runs through it's got just
micro fins or fins sticking up into the
block into the channels those three goes
back to the reindeer pretty simple but
interesting now being honest of course
memory really doesn't need a whole lot
of cooling so this is going to be
another one of those things where it's
like it's different and maybe you want
it because it's kind of interesting
because when we run memory out like say
two vaults for example 4000 megahertz
it's typically fine on just air but I
guess it'll depend on you know how it
ends up looking at the end of the day
because I guess you can do RGB LEDs on
like a kit of memory that doesn't have a
heatsink to begin with and then you
still get the LEDs with a bit of cost
savings on the heatsink side that you
end up making up for when you buy the
cooler it's a very interesting prototype
and I'm curious to see like how this is
all cleaned up when it's done because
you could do some pretty cool stuff with
a single kit as we've kind of seen with
like the mono blocks and stuff to be a
bit different design you could do some
cool stuff with it right now that was
just complete prototype phase last thing
in this room is going to be over here I
don't have a lot of details on these
right now so we're just gonna run
through them and get back to the other
stuff but there's three sets of cases
the one all the way over is the most
interesting looking aluminum box and in
the middle we have a mesh panel with 200
millimeter RGB fan there's a mesh panel
on the front here there's open on the
top with fig dust filters actually this
is a really wide case that's kind of
nice so there's the kind of stuff that
we like to see from Thermaltake and it's
always hidden away in the side room know
why but this the CES had similar stuff
where it was like budget targeted cases
and a lot of the time the budget
targeted cases in the market are garbage
and then you get stuff like budget
targeted cases where they actually do
mash fronts which is pretty rare so I
really want to see the stuff in the main
area but yeah there's more of that we'll
have we don't even have names right now
so we'll talk about this more probably
when it comes out and we review it so
here's the level 20 HT it's a giant cube
and this is pretty interesting kind of
calls back to a few of the previous
Thermaltake designs that we've shown at
other shows but it is the level 20
design like
aesthetic or trope right now which is
what this is this is actually removable
at present it's a plastic piece so if
you wanted to do some case modding we
don't know what the final color will be
it might be white but you can take it
out and paint it yourself if you wanted
to as for the case itself though so
giant box it's compartmentalized the
main compartment for the components is a
tee actually ATX compatible there's it
looks like an ATX board in there right
now and then 360 right on the bottom
there's a 360 right on the side might be
able to go larger on this but we're not
gonna we're not gonna say just yet
because I would need to try it the case
isn't final but it's pretty close the
launch dates looking like probably
September pricing probably $190 for the
rest of the case though on the back side
there's a filter with a set of holes for
two 140 s or 120 s there might be some
changes to the bottom on the the mesh
like cutouts it just kind of depends on
where they're gonna take how much time
they have to make changes but ultimately
we're kind of talked about this at the
booth this is a water cooling case for
the most part you can brute force the
cooling with water so you do have to
look a bit at how it's marketed versus
you know how its intended to be used and
in this case it's marketed as watery
point case it's intended to be used as a
water cooling case so level twenty HT
the top can lift off the i/o for the
motherboard so keyboard/mouse all that
stuff will route out the top here where
there's a channel for the cabling and
the glass on top lifts up pretty easily
so that's separable from the top panel
and then there's another routing hole in
the back for the power supply power
sploit could also move to a different
location but right now it's route it to
the power cable coming out the back
thermal tank will probably include USB
extension cables with this because it is
a bit of a longer run but that should
cover the level twenty HT I think it's
mostly a visual case so will show a lot
of b-roll that'll be it for this one
