Bao vs. SSAO in battlefield 1 does not
have a major impact performance between
AMD or Nvidia we already benchmark the
game on our GPUs now we're back to
benchmark just the ambient occlusion
settings and before diving into the
benchmarks the plan is to go over what
ambient occlusion actually is what
horizon based is versus screen space
z-buffer and its impact on how these
work and all that stuff but before that
this content is brought to you by
Roseville and their new Cullinan case
which has a limited offer that includes
a power supply with the purchase of the
Cullinan tempered glass side panel the
case let's start with the name ambient
occlusion occlusion is the obstruction
of one object by another and ambient in
this case is a reference to the ambient
light source in-game for almost all
games ambient light comes from a single
source and for battlefield that's a
faked Sun which is really just a light
traced across a skybox ambient light
scatters more or less everywhere in game
and that's with a mostly uniform pattern
but there's also directional light which
impacts how the light meets at a single
point and that makes for uneven shadows
and lighting on certain surfaces
depending on where the lights coming
from occluded surfaces are the most
noticeable as recipients of uneven
shadowing and light objects that are
visible to the player but are not
visible to off screen light sources will
feel the most bereft of natural shading
the best earliest example of this mix of
directional and ambient light is the
movie Toy Story wherein Woody's a mouth
appears LED backlit almost like a
monitor and that's because of the mix of
ambient and directional sources of light
this can be resolved with various AO
techniques ao methods help approximate
shadowing of areas with mixed levels of
light interaction this used to be done
with shadow tracing and CGI but has
generally been far too expensive on
system resource available in crunch in
real time it's a lot different when
you're rendering it for a movie gaming
GPUs use SSAO HD a ohpa ovx AO or any
number of other real-time ambient
occlusion solutions or you could always
go off of course screen space or SSAO is
the most prevalent and assumes the
entire world is limited to the z-buffer
so that's anything that exists outside
of the z-buffer
or the cameras perspective basically
what you can see in the game actively is
not traced to calculate shading on
screen here's an example of that this is
an image of a tank with SSAO enabled and
note that the underside of the tank is
not shaded despite the fact that
naturally the underlying ground beneath
the occluding body of the tank would
actually be darker than the rest of the
ground this happens because the tanks
underside is not drawn in the z-buffer
it's not visible and not visible to the
player so it's not rendered obviously a
geometry isn't needed why would you draw
it so we instead turn to other
techniques to resolve this issue of
uneven lighting the X AO is one of the
newest methods not really the point of
this video today but it is used in Tomb
Raider and the same image of the tank
shows the change the x AO isn't alone
though other forms of AO like AMD's HD
AO not too prevalent these days and
Nvidia's HB AO plus also not that crazy
hound but it isn't some gamers titles
have both resolved issues with
attenuation out of frustum objects noise
and grain within shadows and this
continuity we've talked about this in
the past - earlier this year I wrote
about a 2000 word article plus or minus
about ambient occlusion and other game
technologies that impacts lighting and
shading hfst all that stuff but we'll
cover briefly here VX AO just kind of as
a point aside because I didn't mention
it basically converts the scene into
voxels so it takes all the geometric
data converts it into voxels and that's
so that the pixel shader can use the Z
buffer as an input and from that point
it performs all of the proportions to
basically approximate the shadowing on
the scene but battlefield 1 does not use
VX AO so today we are focusing on HBO or
horizon based ambient occlusion and SSAO
screen space ambient occlusion so the
question is does HB AO negatively impact
and these performance in a way which is
demonstrable in a way which would make
AMD look worse in benchmarks than Nvidia
the reason that question came up I
suppose is because technically HB AO is
an Nvidia made technology but it's from
2008 so the answer the short of it is no
not really at least not in this game
battlefield one can either run screen
space or horizon based a o and
again HBO is from 2008 it's well
documented at this point if you want to
learn more about it
that'll field one as far as we are aware
does not offer HBO Plus at least the
options don't call it that but maybe the
developers were just lazy
our testing methodology is all the same
as the battlefield Juan GPU benchmark
that we published earlier today so you
can view or read the previous content if
you have questions about what drivers
reuse test location multiplayer and
singleplayer scaling other curiosities
it's all defined before you post a
comment to check there the only
difference is that we ran our new tests
with battlefield version 1.01 that's
important that includes performance
optimizations overall within the game
and for that reason we reran some of our
dx11 tests on the two devices under test
here just for the specific HB AO vs.
ssao benchmark so again 1.01 and before
we get into the AO here's a look at the
scaling we're seen on battlefield
version 1.2 1.0 1 we're getting about a
1.5 percent better performance on the RX
480 and on the GTX 1080 fairly uniform
between the two though higher framerate
gameplay with lower resolutions is
posting a performance improvement of
about 3 to 4 percent but that's really
only visible when we're north of 100 FPS
already for tests where frame rate is
closer to 60 to 80 we're seeing a 1.5
percent performance gain with a
battlefield version 1.1 and we still
retested HPA OH&amp;amp;S sao with the newer
version of the game just to make sure
we're isolating the variable here's a
look at HB AO vs. SSAO on and these are
X 480 with 1440p ultra settings there's
no real impact here this is 1440p we're
seeing a performance delta of about 1.4
percent or right around one FPS is very
nearly within normal test variants
though we always test multiple times and
average the collections of results so it
is a hard 1.4 percent this isn't just
normal arjun of air or anything like
that at 1080p with ultra the difference
is about 3 FPS so it's a little bit more
from 90 to 93 average and the lowers are
basically unimpacted they're all pretty
much the same the next thing to
determine is how it plays out on Nvidia
since we can't yet reached a conclusion
with just this one settings change all
this does so far has tossed at a higher
quality ambient occlusion setting is
more
in which everyone already knows here's
Nvidia's GTX 1080 at 4k high seen a
performance win of again almost exactly
one point four percent so that is the
same as what we saw on Andy's Hardware
between Sao and HB AO with a higher
resolution which is taxing other aspects
of the GPU enough that it's just a 1.4
percent scale in between each reduce in
the GTX 1080s resolution to 1440p our
performance Delta is now about 2 FPS
average and that's pretty much the same
as what we saw in AMD so the conclusion
very briefly disabling HB AO creates a
scaling at higher resolutions between
nvidia and AMD that is effectively equal
that's because the GPU is taxed
elsewhere the resources are occupied so
we've got about a 1.4 percent change and
because it's the same on each card it
doesn't matter if you enable or disable
it the results will be pretty much
linearly comparable and the game looks
better and it's 1.4 percent so if you're
just playing and you're not benchmarking
probably have it on anyway because if
you really need one FPS you're in bad
shape and it's time to get a new GPU or
reduce the settings elsewhere as for the
lower resolutions that's where we see a
little bit more of a difference it's a
three percent difference versus 3 FPS
versus two fps obviously it depends on
the scale of the range of the data which
is different between the two cards but
the percentage difference basically is a
1% advantage for Nvidia at lower
resolutions when running frame rates
that are in the 80 Plus range 80 to 120
fps in this point so it's really not
significant in the scheme of things 1
percent only at the higher frame rate
test runs and that's generally going to
be with lower resolutions where you're
not bottlenecked just because you're
pushing so many pixels through the pipe
anyway so hopefully that answers that is
always patreon link the post roll video
if you want to learn more about ambient
occlusion all that stuff there is a link
in the description below there's two
ones the GPU benchmark for battlefield
one the other one is our description
