Plaza in Taipei so we're to check this
out it's pretty cool there are several
stores from vendors you'd recognize you
don't have any store presence at all in
the US including gigabyte asus lenovo
has got a store back here intel even so
we're going to walk around to check some
of them out and then there's a building
that we'll get to towards the end of the
strip where it's several stories of just
technology and computer some pretty cool
stuff it is a computer hardware heaven
before getting to the walkthrough this
content is brought to you by Corsair who
now make the t1 race chair priced at
$350 which includes the racing stripe
paint design adjustable arm rests and
for directions and you can learn more at
the link in the description below
monitors aces all AC stuff over here and
they are using they're using the ever
popular Bebo PC as a mouse pad to cut
the Pastis vivo PC has they used in case
anyone needs a molex to 4 pin fan got
lots of those here
I don't I don't think we're allowed in
there there's actually a pretty sweet
store so we don't have a whole lot of at
least where I am North Carolina we don't
have a whole lot of hardware stores in
general but to see a bunch of products
that are actually worthy of buying is
always exciting I know folks in
California Micro Center and things like
that but cool master master liquid
there's a where is it the core froze RL
this is the CPU cooler that we use for
our case testing bench and it's 1790 is
going to be how much 60 some somewhere
around there ETS T 40 cement Ermac tons
the most MSI video cards I've seen in
stock anywhere and insane amount of
stuff
I might have to I have to pick one of
those up
oh that's look disappointing I just like
this wall of wall of cases Wow g502
you use g502 kibble dude kind of gross
to you 502 Oh this where all the 500
series one can find any of they and the
500 stuff on retailers online recently
so there's a 570 right there the strict
how much sixty eight ninety two hundred
thirty dollars on a five seventy that's
actually a little expensive
comparatively this this if they're all
right thermal right an aerial cool are
kind of big here also big here 4-pin
molex to four pin 10 no idea why that's
like the second or third time we've seen
that
a lot bigger than all we've seen so far
I'm not sure we're technically the
digital Plaza starts an end I know
there's actually a proper building as
well but we're obviously and
hey I've never seen that switch before
that's a blue switch of some kind
obviously it's not cherry doesn't look
like kale either unless maybe they've
changed it with a switch that's a proper
cherry brown that's a real switch key
cap set man that's really cool just a
full set of key cap was different and
that's pretty sweet so it's kind of
funky - oh it's Oris giggle a keyboard
there's like a lot of stuff here that
I've never seen before this keyboard is
branded as cyber slam it says as you see
cyber slim combat CW so I mean there are
plenty of keyboard enthusiasts out there
I know in the audience I am NOT one of
them just because I don't have the time
to really dig into it like you guys do
but I haven't seen this before just like
I guess it can be a touchpad but it's
got the browser set into it with
Facebook open and then these I've seen
these before there used to be a Russian
keyboard I can't remember what it was
called I don't say Optimus you see a
Russian keyboard that would do custom
key lighting on everything so there's
the set the image for the switches or
for the key caps it's just like a mini
LCD which is what I have here okay
that's kind of neat it just looks like
membrane now but still I'll admit I
don't know how to use these but uh as I
understand it Jay from Jay's to sign
says okay so this this is the the kind
of story that I look for I see a bunch
of flu testing meters
tons of testing meters moisture meter
salt meter dissolved oxygen meter never
seen those flukes couple flukes down to
the bottom
the prices are on these I don't think
they're going to be any better than home
with thermocouples this is just
individual builds I to probably love
this shout out to build do it just
individual components so there's like
we've got resistors I think I see some
capacitors and some of these over to the
left more lots of resistors Jesus it's
like what what what RadioShack should
have been our GP LEDs can't escape them
maturely cheaper than getting your
keyboard that says Andre you see a price
to 30 to 34 one meter three feet for a
couple bucks seven dollars for three
feet for roughly seven dollars I think
and I think like NZXT and most of those
guys kind include a strip about this
lawn and then snip it about here and you
get like three of them and those $50
kits so they do include the controller's
which are expensive RGB RGB here are
gp120 here you go if anyone's ever had
trouble replacing a laptop fan I've
found your source how much 60 $60 jeez
what 2 bucks so if you need to replace
your laptop fans it's like 2 bucks to
get them in Taiwan just to give you an
idea
I know I've bought stuff like this for
laptops for closer to like 40 ok so we
made it to the digital Plaza the actual
inside building area building looks
crazy off on our side we're going to
head in and check it out we just walked
around through the perimeter it's all
the smaller shops
apparently there's a whole hell of a lot
more so let's head in there next
we're just what near here which one oh
sorry
Rison
see this
so coming out and saying it is
ridiculous
now we now looking for naka my I think I
take plenty of them
that's pretty sweet so we're still here
in the digital shopping center we've
gone up what are we on this floor maybe
think around the fifth floor I think
there might be one more above us it
looks like but easy to be in here for
hours if you want to days probably it
goes on almost literally forever every
single direction and everything from PC
components so plenty of motherboards
video card seems like class the prices
are not special here in fact they're a
little bit higher on some of the stuff
but that kind of makes sense come in the
marketplace then there's other stuff
that's not PC component like walls of
cables or one of the booths we saw that
was just wall to mouse what Walter floor
wall to floor to ceiling to wall mice
just there was absolutely no walking
space so it's pretty crazy definitely
definitely kind of overwhelming to try
and figure out where to go or what to
see but plenty of stuff to look at right
that was the Guan hast shopping mall
we're exhausted it was a long walk
through a stick twice I think
plus there was another one the one we
were in front of originally was the
higher end like complete consumer
electronics mall looks a bit new where
it's got basically full app tops and
phones and all that kind of stuff we
were interested in components that we
came here well that's everything so
thank you for watching subscribe for
more as always the this should be going
up at the end of our coffee tech
coverage which means that you've already
seen all the stuff from the show
probably if you haven't go back and
watched all of it otherwise we'll be
back at home base soon and doing normal
videos as always I'll see you all next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
