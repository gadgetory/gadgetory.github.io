and access hotnet and today we're
looking at this a very big laptop this
is eight pounds more than my nerd arms
can handle you can see it's about two
inches thick and about 17 inches wide so
we'll just put this down over here this
is a cyber power fan book 3h x7 - 300 it
is very powerful and it is built
effectively as a desktop replacement
which we'll talk more about in a moment
the fan book 3 was put through our
extensive battery testing FPS testing
and thermal testing benchmark so the
processor in this thing is an Intel i7
37 10 MQ 3.5 gigahertz processor that is
a mouthful and it's actually more
powerful in a lot of desktop CPUs it's
very good with media production like
video rendering and obviously good with
gaming as a result of that other than
the CPU it's got a gtx 980m mobile
version of Nvidia's Maxwell GPUs so the
980m very powerful for gaming and media
tasks it's got 16 gigabytes of Ripjaws
1600 megahertz RAM that is ddr3 of
course and then it's got a 128 gigabyte
SSD alongside
a 1 terabyte 7200 rpm hard drive these
are this is not an m2 SSD by the way
it's a proper SATA SSD and the hard
drive is a standard laptop hard drive at
7200 rpm so very good specs and the
performance of course you would expect
is also very good now with most laptops
you have a few concerns first of all
they sort of die over time with thermals
and that is especially because of
thermal paste losing its efficacy as the
laptop ages it sort of dries out and
needs to be replaced and other than that
the fan bearings get worn or the system
is in too cramped of a space and it's
generating lots of heat over its whole
life which is what causes the compound
to dry out so these are our concerns
with laptops and a quick disclaimer I
can only test these things for a few
weeks at a time before we have to
publish a review so I don't know what's
gonna happen in a year or two but I can
predict pretty well based on how the
laptop is designed and how it is built
and that's what we're looking at right
now so inside you can see I can just
remove the back panel here
we have instant access to the GP or the
CPD of the RAM and the hard drives or
SSDs in this case so that's basically
everything anyone who's ever opened a
laptop before notice how big this is
normally you have to remove the
backplate
you unscrew a bunch more screws under
that flip it over remove the keyboard
and then after you remove the keyboard
you move the chassis you remove a
protective plate that sits on top of the
GPU and the CPU and then you have access
to the heat sinks that we want to mess
with to redo the thermal paste this one
you just removed the back and you can
see everything so that's pretty cool now
when we look at it we can also see the
thermal design and the design of this
laptop is very good actually it uses a
single side intake vent where the fan is
so it's pulling air in from that vent
from the side and then it's got a bunch
of bottom layer exhaust vents now this
means you can't ever lay it on a blanket
or anything like that you basically got
to use it on a solid service all the
time but that's sort of expected with a
desktop replacement the laptop uses
large heat pipes and a couple of large
aluminum copper heat sinks on top of the
core components so it should stay pretty
cool and actually does stay pretty cool
in our thermal testing and as long as
you've got it on a solid surface it will
exhaust all that heat now this laptop is
two thousand dollars two thousand eighty
dollars to be exact and it is very
similar to an MSI gt70 in fact uses the
same chassis as the MSI gt70 if you're
familiar with that one what's different
though unlike the GT 70 this one ships
with a gtx 980m and the SSD and a
slightly better slightly better other
components at two thousand $80.00 you
basically have a high-end gaming
computer you could build this system in
desktop form for probably closer to
$1500 but it's it's marginally less
portable than the CyberPower notebook
we're looking at today and I say
marginally because this thing is big
enough that you're really only going to
be moving it between work and home and
maybe a land event with friends you're
not going to moving it around on an hour
to hour basis it's really not that
portable let's look at the benchmarks in
terms of gameplay you can see that the
gtx 980m is capable of pushing ninety
FPS in some titles and basically always
stays at or above say
the FPS which is very playable in fact
more powerful than a lot of desktop GPUs
that's because the 980 M is in here with
an i7 CPU in terms of battery operated
gameplay the 9 ATM throttles itself very
hard this is an Nvidia design not a
cyber powered design the GPU will
actually throttle down so that it is
only powerful enough to push a constant
30 fps which is what they sort of define
as a playable fps when you're on battery
this helps preserve battery life by
reducing the amount of power required by
the GTX 980 because it was only working
hard enough to push 30 fps when it is
functioning on battery in our tests
using pure gaming meaning you're not
doing anything else by gaming for the
entire life of the battery it lives
about an hour and 24 minutes not too bad
but also not fantastic and when you're
not gaming it's only slightly longer
than that pushes about three hours at
the very very best using an efficient
power control settings our thermal
benchmark looks more like this this
shows the thermals of desktop GPUs along
with the mobile GP we just tested and
you can see it's about four degrees
warmer than the GTX and I needed
reference video card you put in a
desktop considering the amount of power
this thing has in the cramped space it's
in that's pretty solid overall because
some of the Toshiba gaming laptops I've
looked at pushed closer to 90 Celsius
and then eventually burn out the thermal
paste and then you've got overheating
problems for the rest a little hop tops
life so this thing theoretically will
not run at that issue because of the
thermal design that we looked at earlier
and because the 980 M is a very
efficient GPU so what's the verdict here
well in terms of gaming it's very
high-end gaming performance you can push
this to a 1440p display and have no
problem whatsoever playing games at that
resolution and it's basically a desktop
it is it truly a desktop replacement
this thing is not a laptop in the sense
we normally think of them it's not ultra
portable and you probably will have to
buy a new backpack for it to be honest
because it doesn't fit a lot of
backpacks that I have for conventions
that said it is very powerful for media
production it rendered 2 minute 28
megabit per second videos in about two
minutes and that's pretty revolutionary
for people who produce a lot of media
content at 2080 dollars the value is
actually very good compared to other
laptops on the market MSI's and
and the gaming power the performance is
also very good what you lose is
portability so this isn't something I
can review for you you need to decide
how portable does my laptop need to be
and if it's not too portable and it can
effectively be a desktop do I really
want a laptop instead of a desktop in
other words is this something you're
bringing into the office orbiting into
LAN events or something like that I
probably wouldn't use this laptop for
school if you're one of those people
because it's really not portable enough
for that you're not gonna want to lug it
out of a backpack and put on desk
whatever it's not good for that you want
something skinnier and a little shorter
but if you want a 17 inch screen for
media production for high-end gaming and
you can put it where a desktop normally
goes this is very good value the frame
rates are great and CyberPower has a
pretty solid warranty program so that is
the CyberPower fame book 3 check link to
the description below for full review
and the benchmark charts and I will see
you all next time peace
