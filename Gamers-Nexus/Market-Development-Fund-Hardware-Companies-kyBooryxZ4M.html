topic for you this looks at how
companies increase their exposure of
products outside of traditional means
like advertising for instance when a
company advertises on a traditional
media outlet that's different from when
they do other forms of advertising like
through marketing development with
partner companies or affiliates in the
channel today we're talking about that
we'll be going over how these different
avenues of exposure happen how they are
generally agreed to what it means and if
it means anything for you we'll also be
talking about some of the way that the
retailers operate like new AG and Amazon
for instance without too much on it
specifics but enough to give you an idea
of how Company A versus Company B might
get more exposure on one of those retail
outlets versus another this is a topic
that's been of interest lately as we've
seen a few comments discussing the
different modes of exposure for
companies and how they get their
products marketed whether or not that's
good or bad is one thing but we can
certainly talk about how it works in the
very least before we get into that this
is brought to you by our patreon backers
who helped viewers like you get an
inside look at the industry and
generally expand our testing efforts you
can go to patreon.com/scishow and become
one of the patreon backers or you can go
to games next with Squarespace com2 pick
up a shirt like our new GN anniversary
edition logo shirt so today we're
focusing on a discussion of marketing
Development Fund or sometimes called
market Development Fund which is
abbreviated as MDF this is a term you
hear a lot working in the industry
whether on our side or on the
manufacturer side and it has different
meanings to different people to
different companies even in different
industries but within the world that we
occupy and computer hardware generally
the idea is that MDF is an allotment of
money or rebate or some contingent of a
currency whether it's a credit rebate or
just hard cash that can be spent toward
things with the companies that are in
partnership this is generally used for
the partners to push their channel
exposure so for example an SI would have
an MDF allotment with someone like Intel
with
maybe with nvidia with maybe with
corsair or really any of the
manufacturers you can think of they
generally have different agreements in
place with one another strategic
alliances are sort of in the same bucket
but a bit separate and that helps the
companies expand their brand awareness
and expand their shipment of certain
products like maybe a power supply ship
more of them in a particular quarter if
you establish an alliance with an SI and
establish some sort of MDF between the
two companies so that everyone feels
happy with the agreement at the end of
the day so this is something that's a
very interesting topic it's one that we
are able to fortunately speak with some
of the SIS on the manufacturers about
and get some insight but overall this is
actually an object with which you come
into contact on a daily basis maybe
without even knowing it so for example
when you go to new egg and you see those
banners on new eggs web sites those
generally come from a pool of MDF
whether it's rebates or otherwise and
that's because those banners aren't free
so if you see a banner advertising a
particular company's product either they
have straight paid for the banner which
from what I've been told is fairly
uncommon or more likely they have an
account with nooooow already they have
some MDF that they can spend the
manufacturer that is and then take out a
banner for something like a holiday but
let's take it back of step as stated
earlier MDF is seen as different things
of different companies and different
people generally speaking MDF is
distributed as something like a rebate
or in some cases just hard cash once a
certain agreement has been fulfilled for
example ship X of our product in your
systems and fulfill a quota for whatever
quarter and we'll give you Y amount back
for each of those systems ship in which
case the company either gets that in a
rebate that can be spent with their
partner for example on hardware that can
be used they can lower their cost for
the systems and their bill of materials
or maybe just in hard cash so they can
use for whatever they want it depends on
the agreement establish between the two
companies of course so this is different
from buying in bulk and si might for
example by 20,000 units of
particular motherboard or something like
that if they know they're shipping a lot
of SKUs of a specific build for a
specific period of time buying a lot of
units is different from MDF they might
have a lower cost on those units than
you would as a consumer this is how some
of the SIS are able to get their prices
so close to DIY prices even though
they're assembling it for you and that's
because they are well one the SI is
generally will ask for things outside of
the retail packaging so either just in a
brown box or some other low-cost
packaging so you cut a whole lot of
money off right there because the boxes
are actually expensive in some cases and
then - they're just exceeding moq or
they're really ordering high-volume
which shows always in any kind of supply
or manufacturing business means that
your cost goes down as we discussed
somewhat recently in an SDN actually but
that's different than getting something
like a rebate for fulfilling contractual
agreements where you might be placing
specific products on specific systems so
let's go through a few examples of this
in action
the main one here MDF is mostly useful
as something like a rebate pool of money
so let's take a retailer as the first
example and then we'll look at
manufacturer internal relations next if
you're looking at something like a
retailer what might happen is a company
let's just go ahead and call it company
X because it doesn't I don't think any
companies we work with start with X on t
conclusions no it's not Xigmatek it's
not that my sware company x might go to
Newegg and give them $100,000 per act
for per period of time let's say per
quarter so we give you $100,000 per
quarter for operating services what does
that include
that includes things like handling your
inventory holding the stock physically
in a warehouse at the Newegg location
supplying in analytics engine where you
can track the cel-3 rate for example the
product or generally just handling and
shipping things and giving you materials
and software to conduct business through
that retail outlet in a way that
hopefully makes you money you pay for
that service but what do you get in
addition to that no egg has to sweeten
the deal so what do they do
one thing they might offer is say okay
as part of your hundred
thousand dollars you're paying us for
this quarter what we will also do for
you is give you a pull of money MDF that
you can use for other things like
banners on our website to promote your
products during periods of time which
you find useful for driving sales higher
so that's part of it you get this pool
of money that with this specific example
that company X can happen to pull ten
thousand dollars let's say and maybe use
space at new exudes at a trade show they
exchanged this MDF that they already
have with Newegg so it's not seen as
coming from an actual account it's still
money it's still real money but it's not
coming from the same budget as the
marketing team might normally be
spending from where they're given a
certain budget for advertising with
media outlets or for trade shows or her
flights and transit for employees to go
to trade shows or for media members to
go to media events that's a different
allocation and so MDF can be pulled from
two one mentally make it feel like
you're spending money from a different
place meant to in reports you are
spending money from a different place so
it gives you the ability to be a bit
more mobile with what you decided to do
so some of that money from new eggs and
the app for company acts might go to
find space at their booth at a trade
show or and effectively look like a $0
fan because you've already spent the
money at the beginning of the quarter
just for the services of being sold on
new eggs website so that's one example
another example is you might have
manufacturers of hardware approaching
sis and saying we want you to fulfill
this quota or ship this many systems
with this particular product that we
make for the next period of time and in
exchange for that we will give you
rebates or will give you big discounts
on this item so that it you can improve
your margins or so that you can undercut
your competitors and price or whatever
it may be
basically benefit the business if you
use this product in your system until an
AMD both do this as an example that
everyone's familiar with so for a
specific example there have been times
when we've received systems from sis
that might contain specific components
that were put in there
because of an agreement with the company
making the component an example would be
a GPU for instance there was a period of
time when there were review systems
going out from sis that contained a very
specific model of GPU and that was as
part of an agreement to drive down the
cost and benefit the SI and of course
once we get it in-house we do whatever
we want with it swap the GPU if we need
to or whatever but they've fulfilled
their agreement and so the manufacturer
is happy they get their MDF share and
they can spend that however they have
agreed disbanded and the big point here
is that really everyone does this it's
just a matter of how much money do they
have and who cannot spend the other so
looking at that Andy has done this with
their Radeon 300 series GPUs where sis
would send out systems to reviewers with
only r9 302 GPUs for review units and
that was part of their agreement Intel
does it with CPUs and systems from SAS
as well as many of you know and then
even if you look at case cooler power
supply manufacturers same fan it extends
through the whole industry it's not just
the big three being the big three
silicon semiconductor manufacturers
Intel and NVIDIA this also extends
people like Corsair and folks like that
NZXT
really you name it Coolermaster they all
have different agreements with s i--'s
and with retailers where money exchanges
hands to promote a product one way or
another or to shift more of a product
and particular system for a time period
and then either they keep up those
agreements and continue shipping the
systems with those products or someone
else comes in and makes a better deal
for the SI or for the retailer whomever
it baby
and then retailer MDF is mostly based on
how much business you conduct with the
retailer like new Agra Amazon again the
banners aren't free there and so some of
that moves out of the market development
funds which is largely based on volume
moved through that particular retailer
at least in New X case this is kind of
seen as cost of doing business so it's
mentally separated from the normal funds
that the marketing department has access
to and might include funds for
purchasing ad space or buying components
for tradeshow systems or flights for
events as discussed but this one is
separate and used specifically for
or different needs like from a retailer
and this feeds into where again just to
kind of recap the earlier point
retailers charge a service fee to use
all of their shipping analytics their
product listings and SKU management and
all that stuff that's not free and just
because they make money selling the
product doesn't mean that they give it
to you for free because margins are
actually really low in the hardware
industry in most cases actually most
pretty much all of the high-end hardware
cases you're looking at below 10%
margins it's not till you look at
something like a case fan where the
margins are way better to the point
where they start making up for your
small margins in other areas so the
tools aren't free the retailer's can
make back some more money since the
margins are low for them on a lot of
products and so they sell the service of
selling the items to the manufacturers
and then to make it sound like it's
better than it is of course they do
different agreements like we've been
discussing you might see companies like
in the past be quite to this it was a
public thing so it's certainly no secret
where if you go to a new egg's website
and you see a product listed by a
company like be quiet it might be sold
by that company directly rather than
sold and shipped by Newegg this at least
for a while I'm not sure with the cases
today for a while this was a good way to
bypass the requirement of spending for
Newegg to handle the services for you so
your company is now responsible for all
the core services shipping handling all
that stuff customer communication but as
a result you're not spending the money
on the service provided by Newegg
because they're not providing it though
perhaps you have less exposure through
their banners or less exposure through
their featured items listings or less
exposure when sales go live so you could
see why these companies all kind of
fight each other financially to try and
get prioritization on different
retailers and a couple other examples of
where this type of stuff gets used in
the real world outside of a retailer if
you remember our bloatware coverage in
the past like with Emma size laptops as
we stated there a lot of that isn't it's
not because msi or any of these
companies are trying to say look at all
these great features were providing you
that's certainly what they say it is but
that's not why those software solutions
are on the computers or the laptops or
whatever it is they're on there because
there's bargaining agreements between
the companies so you can get some extra
income as the creator of the system if
you agree with Norton to install and
ship their software on a million systems
or whatever it is so that's another
example of where MDF or at least
marketing agreements if not MDF come
into play another example you may
sometimes see in system integrator
builds a high wattage power supply's
doesn't make a lot of sense or something
like that you see a component where
you're like I wouldn't choose that why
is that in there well for a lot of those
cases keep in mind that the SI is often
get that stuff a lot cheaper than you
could and it might just be an instance
where they have a lot of them on the
shelves as part of some agreement and
they can get them a lot cheaper then a
consumer could retail anyway so it's not
going to hurt them to put it in the
system if they already have a ton of
them sitting on a shelf in fact it may
actually better if they're putting a
bunch of 800 watt power supplies into
computers that don't need them just
because maybe that particular 800 watt
power supply is going al or they need to
get it off the shelves in clear space or
they just have a ton of them at discount
prices or whatever it may be or they
just have some agreement to ship a lot
of that particular power supply
Microsoft also offers them the for using
its operating systems and build so this
is something like a rebate basically
where you install the glass on your
systems you meet a whole bunch of
requirements and then if you've met
those requirements if Microsoft's happy
if you've installed their OS on the
system ship then you get a rebate
basically off of your cost that you
spent on the keys so as an SI you're
still spending money on all those
activation keys and license keys and
then at the end of the quarter or the
period that the contract plays out you
get some of that money back from
Microsoft to spend on what you want or
what they say you can spend it on it
that there's some strict - sure
requirement in their agreement it really
just depends on the company so that's
what we're looking at that is a
breakdown of the basics of how marketing
development fund gets used or the
differences between MDF it does
traditional advertising
or traditional promotional budget there
are bit different things they are
thought about in different ways within
the companies keep in mind that if
you've ever worked in a corporate
environment which I'm sure many of you
do you know that between departments
there's often vying or fighting for
budget and so this is another pool of
budget with a different label that the
companies can internally work with and
hopefully make things a bit easier for
them when they're trying to accomplish
very specific things with retailers or
with sis or generally increase
increasing brand exposure and awareness
this is a there's a lot more to know
here this is not an area where we
specialize we are not marketing experts
we are technology testers and
enthusiasts so this gives you a top
level explanation hopefully it helps
folks understand why you see the
advertisements and promotions you do and
I don't mean on like a YouTube channel
or on a website I mean on retailers
where they advertise to you or
throughout size you see all those
banners on their pages that promote a
products at the top of the page there's
a reason for that it's not just free at
least most the time it's not just free
the same goes for pretty much every part
in the system so they all pretty much do
it just wanted to point that out that
