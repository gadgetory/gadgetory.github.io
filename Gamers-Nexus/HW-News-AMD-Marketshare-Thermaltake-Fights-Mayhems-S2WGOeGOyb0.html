hardware news recap for the week in this
one we're talking about Softbank one of
Nvidia's the biggest investors selling
out its shares Thermaltake legally
posturing against Mayhem's the liquid
cooling manufacturer competing liquid
cooling manufacturer gigabyte might be
laying off some of its workforce it
looks like and NVIDIA also seems to have
not known or not shown the true impact
of cryptocurrency on its revenue because
it was looking significant based on some
new financial reports and then there's
also updates on Intel's Oregon
expansions a Zen architecture driving
market share growth or AMD and Adobe
alluding to ARM processors before that
this video is brought to you by us and
the GN store we recently added a
modified disappointment shirt that we're
calling the GPU artifact in shirt
designed with XTS and Space Invaders
you'd get in real GP artifacting we also
have our critically acclaimed PC
building mod mats GN cobalt blue beer
glasses with gold trim and black and
blue light weight hoodies for cool
weather go to store documents nexus net
to pick something up and support GN
today it's first up for this week
Softbank selling its shares back in
december we mentioned one of Nvidia's
biggest investors Softbank which had
about a three billion dollar stake 3.6
billion dollars in the company was
looking to get out and this was December
this is no longer a consideration
because the sale has gone through at
this point so in third quarter 19
earnings Softbank said that it sold its
entire 3.6 billion dollar investment
finalized On January 10th which is sort
of another blow to Nvidia in what's been
a turbulent past couple of quarters here
some of which has been due to
cryptocurrency fall off and others due
to product launches on our previous
episode we detailed Nvidia's struggle
with slow RT x sales and the continued
decline of its fourth quarter revenue
guidance so NVIDIA has been struggling
in China as have a lot of tech companies
at this point and videos also had issues
of course with its RT X launch with
Pascal still flooding the market at the
time it launched it's mostly gone now
though and the company is is dealing
with the consequences of going pretty
much all in on the crypto
currency we'll talk about that last
point more in a moment for the next news
item though thermaltake is legally
posturing against Mayhem's friend of the
site vs g one of the writers over at
tech power up just published a piece on
a brewing a legal dispute over the usage
of pastel as a name for cooling products
essentially this boils down to every
cool ins company in the industry EK
thermaltake and alpha cool included all
wanting to use the same word to describe
their coolants of pastel colors despite
Mayhem's technically being the first
that we know of and having a trademark
in the UK in two of those instances
Mayhem's granted EK and alpha kool
permission to use the pastel name and
Thermaltake situation Thermaltake is
insisting that pastel is a generic name
and should not be trademarked and so
seeks to challenge the requirement of
permission in order to use the UK
registered trademark or likely trying to
invalidate it now international legal
battles are expensive and difficult
especially for the smaller of the two
companies so we'll see where this goes
the obvious first choice for any sort of
dispute like this is to reach a
reasonable agreement between two parties
a settlement before going to any kind of
legal proceedings as we understand it
Mayhem's did reach out to Thermaltake
and did try to reach an agreement
Thermaltake has apparently not responded
in any meaningful fashion VSG and the
tech power up also reached out to third
we'll take for comments on this story
and thermaltake did not provide one at
time of filming our news recap anyway so
what happens next well Mayhem's posted a
comment on the story and did state that
the UK registered trademark relates
specifically to coolant and chemicals
for cooling responding to some comments
that were questioning whether the word
pastel which is to be fair a generic
word should really be trademarked and
their defense was well we want a
trademark it for this specific use case
and and that was sort of the defense for
that so by this reasoning that it is
inherently non-genetic generous it's
trademarked for a specific product or
use case Mayhem's reportedly made
several offers to Thermaltake to license
the name including one that asks
Thermaltake to make a 100 british pound
nation to charity in exchange for the
ability to use that name so this is
where it's it's almost like a mind games
play here because if their own take says
no or reject that offer then thermaltake
just kind of looks like it's being a
dick if we're honest it's not really
it's not really a good move ever just
say you know what we're not gonna give
money to charity take that at the same
time though it is reasonable potentially
from thermal takes positioning to say no
if they're gonna take believes that the
trademark is invalid because saying yes
to this offer although it would be good
publicity for everybody it would also
probably indicate that the trademark is
valid it would be a a legal statement
effectively from Thermaltake say and we
will give this money to charity and
license your trademark thereby echnology
in the trademark is valid so it's it's
an interesting play from Mayhem's it's
kind of a good play from a mind game
standpoint in a publicity standpoint
because it really puts thermaltake in
that awkward position of do you want to
look extremely bad to the public but
reject continue to reject the validity
of the trademark or do you want to just
accept it and have good publicity for
everybody maybe even raise them on it or
one-up them on the donation amount so
very interesting choices now we'll see
where this goes VSG says the story is
developing Theron will take does have a
troubled legal past many of you are
likely aware previously embattled with
case labs now defunct and also accused
several times of sort of lifting case
designs for its own so it's a
troublesome spot fourth on all take to
be in once again they keep finding
themselves in this position and that's
probably a bad thing because just in
terms of public perception it's not
great now the third we'll take is one of
our advertisers and it's sometimes very
unfortunate that they they're dealing
with this while trying to run ads
because well I mean they are now a
controversial company that won't take
make some genuinely good products we do
think that Corp III is good
unfortunately obviously
don't necessarily agree what their own
takes reasoning to continue to get into
legal battles when it could just for
instance pick a different name seems
like a pretty easy way to sidestep the
entire issue there are other words than
pastel to use to name your product
simple as that so I you know thermal
takes a very frustrating company in a
lot of ways despite being an advertiser
and going off-script a bit here if they
don't take does some things where it's
like been the the US team that we work
with it seems like you guys really want
to make a good product you're trying
hard but you're getting so much pushback
from everybody else in the company and
then you have the the legal team I guess
which is a completely different group
than the product team and the PR teams
that is also extremely aggressive and
not particularly good for publicity I
guess so it's whether or not Thermaltake
is in the right on this one and I have
no present opinion on this but I would
be curious to hear your thoughts below
it does seem like given the company's
current controversial status it would
have been better to avoid the issue
entirely by just at least for now using
a different name just because again from
a PR standpoint if thermal takes trying
to claw backs from ground here and some
goodwill with the community and this
does poor things against that effort so
even if titi thinks it is correct then
you know maybe just challenge it another
time when you have some more goodwill I
guess so anyway the result of all this
is that you should read vsts article
it's a great article it's great write-up
of the events thus far and I believe it
was an exclusives attack power up so
please read their article will link it
in the show notes below VSG did speak
with a number of retailers in the space
and x case labs employees and has some
additional reporting in quotes from
those vendors and retailers what they
think of this situation the short of it
is that many of the retailers are
planning to refuse to sell the
Thermaltake pastel line in a sort of
sort of show of support to Mayhem's for
having been while
first and as many of you commenters can
agree that is the most important thing
in the world and also having a trademark
on it so that's where it stands now
Rita's article for the rest we are
curious your thoughts as well please
leave them below I have no present
position until we see this develop
further but my position other than that
outs externally from this issue is that
I wish Thermaltake would be a less
frustrating company because they have
some things that are just genuinely good
and then they do these really weird
screwy things that kind of overshadow
the genuinely good efforts to the extent
that people don't even care anymore
because they're so focused on the the
legal and battlements and things like
that so anyway next news item gigabyte
could be laying off 10% of its workforce
here so in a recent report by digital
times which is typically ends up being
accurate and just about everything that
publishes that at least that we show
here so in the report gigabyte is
allegedly looking to reduce fiscal
expenses for 2019 primarily in its
motherboard segment and this is due to
weak motherboard sales so gigabyte could
be laying off five to ten percent of its
workforce depending on how it wants to
cut these expenses marketing expenses
are also on the table for discussion
allegedly anyway and gigabyte
motherboard sales have been steadily
declining since 2016 that decline is
predicted to perpetuate throughout 2019
as such gigabyte is aiming for a modest
10 million units in sales for the year
previously issues an MSI also
acknowledged their own struggles with
motherboards sales and part of this is
because of the well-documented Intel
Seabee shortage that has played really
no small part in the wider impact of the
industry see our previous week's
coverage for the look at how Microsoft
is partly blaming Intel for a lack of
Windows adoption as Intel CPUs have it
slowed down in sales due to the
shortages so back to Nvidia back that
first news item here
Nvidia by now is no stranger to the sort
of unforgiving headwinds in the market
caused by cryptocurrency in general the
company like a of the end others did
well last year and the year prior as a
result of the crypto mining boom but is
now paying a bit
that tax for having invested so much so
post crypto mining boom and Vidya has
struggled significantly with lower
revenue guidance continually adjusting
it the most recent adjustment was a
subtraction of about 500 million dollars
in expected revenue for for the quarter
and part of this was a challenge due to
excess past gala cards in the channel
that were produced to meet this demand
but the company's total exposure to the
cryptocurrency market may have been more
masks than let on presumably to avoid a
heavier stock crash or decline so Royal
Bank of Canada capital market analyst
Mitch Steves said the following we think
Nvidia generated one point nine five
billion dollars in total revenue related
to crypto and blockchain this compares
to company's statement that it generated
around six hundred and two million over
the same period
according to Steve's no not not those
Steve's according to Steve his total
revenue for cryptocurrency should have
been about two point seven five billion
from April 2017 so we're going back a
bit here to July 2018 and video
speculated to have captured about three
quarters of that mark about seventy-five
percent of that market where obviously
that would leave AMD with the remaining
twenty five percent of total revenue
from the cryptocurrency market so what
this amounts to is that the companies
had more of a stake in crypto than may
have been led on Steve's up sites am
these recent earnings report as a source
of credence to his theory where I am the
lowered its own quarter one revenue
guidance to 1.25 billion a twenty four
percent decline year-over-year this
implies that potentially am the
accounted for two hundred thirty four
million dollars of crypto revenue in
2018 which would it roughly equate to
twenty five percent of the total revenue
according to Amit Steve's there's no
real way to confirm these numbers and
this is a fact that the RBC analyst
admits that said it should be taken with
a grain of salt and not as an absolute
but either way it is probably likely or
probable at least that the companies did
make quite a bit from crypto and
blockchain so it's not unreasonable to
expect that they made more than perhaps
was accounted for in the public reports
and investor meetings part of this
challenge is because it is to be fair
difficult to differentiate
between a user purchasing six video
cards through newegg or something is
that for mining is that for a small PC
building business is it for personal use
when you're buying multiple cards and
reasonably at some point you can look at
an order and say well that's for
cryptocurrency but then again you can
buy multiple cards for lots of things it
might be for a rendering machine or for
perhaps some sort of distributing
computing model so distributed so
difficult thing to measure but probably
more than was led on Intel's Itanium
processors if anyone remembers those
will reach end-of-life in 2021 in this
next news story so Intel announced that
it's discontinuing the Itanium 9700 line
of CPUs codenamed Kitson in 2021 the
9700 series not that 9700 are the last
processors on the market to use Intel's
Itanium architecture and the chips
haven't seen a manufacturing node to
shift since 2010 they're still being
fabricated at 32 nanometers according to
an attack which has a great write-up on
this Intel's only customer using these
chips is HP Enterprise so the impact is
likely to be minimal to the market
once-upon-a-time Itanium what was
heralded as the future as the industry
was moving from 32-bit to 64-bit
computing Itanium was intended to
transform the x86 architecture but ended
up being not very x86 capable the VL IWR
very long instruction word called ia-64
was hard to optimize x86 code for around
the same time AMD's Opteron introduced
AMD 64 its own version of 64-bit
extensions to the x86 ISA or instruction
set architecture and these 64 was
completely backwards compatible with
32-bit x86 code and software so it
quickly became the de facto standard and
there's one that we still use today so
it looks like Itanium is going to die
out here and further on Intel Intel is
at this point confirmed to be pushing
its Oregon expansion that we've reported
on the previous two weeks now so this is
pretty big news Intel has confirmed its
plans it is indicating that the company
plans to build a large third phase
through their Oregon d1x
facility this is a fabrication plant
obviously based in the US the third
phase
expected to be similar in size to the
previous two phases that were added and
its construction should begin this year
2019 so Intel has been vague overall
about the details surrounding the
project although several of them have
leaked before official announcement and
were then confirmed to be accurate the
company has notified approximately 50
residents of the Ramla acres campus
about the upcoming expansion so
according to the Oregon or Oregon
according to The Oregonian Intel says
it's quote plans to remain contingent on
unspecified business and economic
factors so whatever that means it's
probably something either way though the
company is planning to expand its
fabrication facilities and that is
probably good news at this point given
the shortages recently Zen architecture
driving market share growth for Andy is
one of our last two stories here and
probably one of the more interesting and
its recent earnings call AMD CEO dr.
Lisa su highlighted key points in the
company's trajectory such as reaching
its highest profitability since 2011 now
and also seen accelerated market share
growth however she didn't elaborate on
the latter so we'll have to wait to see
more on that analysts at mercury
research have released some data that
better outlines those statements from
the earnings calls and he currently
holds 15.8% of the consumer PC market
and that includes desktops which is a
3.9 percent gain year-over-year it also
represents Andy's biggest slice held in
the desktop PC market since about 2014
when it comes to notebooks AMD's
adoption rate has been very slow but the
company is making some inroads Andy has
gained an impressive 5.3 percent market
share year-over-year thanks in part to
Intel's inability to deliver chips to
OEMs Andy has been aggressively trying
to invade the server space with epic
where Intel has been comfortably sitting
atop the food chain for some time and
will remain for some time while
enterprise and server clients are
hesitant about investing in new
platforms Andy has seen some success
with epic especially with cloud service
providers and ease at server market
share has gone from 0.8 percent to 3.2
percent according to mercury research
this growth has primarily been off the
back of AMD's a zen based products and
while Intel is still the dominant player
the numbers indicate that Andy is
clawing back a valuable market share in
the desktop PC space and across some
other segments of the market laptops to
come and working more with sis or system
integrators and OEMs also to come for
Rison 3 or the Zen 2 architecture so
this is looking like some true
competition in the CPU space finally and
a better back and forth volley of
products if you haven't really been in
the industry up until recently you
missed the massive sort of role in
development as we were stuck with the
same really the same product from Intel
year after year while I am the
continually struggled to make FX work in
a way that was good and competitive so
it's quite a bit different now than it
was a few years ago last one ant or
adobe rather different a names company
Adobe alludes to custom arm designs
coming up at a conference Adobe CTO Ave
Perez Ness saluted to a future interest
in custom silicon for Adobe software and
a story by Axios Fresnos is quoted as
saying well quote do we need to become
an arm licensee I don't have an answer
but it is something that we are going to
have to pay attention to you presence
went on to say that arm does afford a
model for a software company to package
its technology much closer to silicon
while expressing Adobe's interest in AI
machine learning AR and VR see the CTO
also stated that he believes the world
is at the cusp of requiring more
powerful hardware and he believes arm
will be the future the last point being
actually interesting in the previous
point about the world needs more
powerful hardware really not that
surprising
so now Adobe which makes the world's
most reliable software can now make the
most reliable seat well someone else to
make the CPU but they'll they'll
probably contribute and that might not
be for the best based on our experience
with Adobe so that's it for this week as
