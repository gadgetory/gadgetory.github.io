in Taiwan where motherboards and video
cards are made gigabyte makes about
200,000 motherboards here per month and
200,000 video cards here per month total
450,000 units the other 50k there are
from things like systems laptops things
like that so gigabyte has moved a
tremendous amount of its operation to
Taiwan and today we're going to walking
through some of the SMT lines we walk in
through dip one of the other line so
that's a different floor we'll be
looking at and this will give you a full
start to finish look at how motherboards
are made and the same exact process
applies to video cards so we'll be
looking at I think the be 360 aorist
gaming three is the motherboard we'll be
following through the start to finish
today but it's the same process for
everything so SMT lines are pretty cool
we'll start with a solder paste machine
it eventually goes through optical
inspection it goes to reflow it goes
through pic in place and we'll be doing
voiceover to explain all those because
there's a lot of information here to get
through so let's start with the factory
tour of gigabytes of motherboard and
video card factory nan pain Taiwan
before that this video is brought to you
by the Corsair 1i 140 compact gaming PC
the Corsair 1i 140 is a small
form-factor PC outfitted with a 9700 K
RT x 28 e 32 gigabytes of RAM and a 480
gigabyte nvme SSD all house then a 2
millimeter thick aluminum chassis the
corsair 1i 140 is a 12 liter system fit
for desktop use for the same size I 160
counterpart with higher-end parts learn
more at the link in the description
below gigabytes factory is split into a
few different areas
there's the BIOS programming station the
semi-automated packaging line and the
SMT lines where eleven different lines
prepare around 400,000 video cards and
motherboards every month this process is
identical for the video cards and the
motherboards the only thing that changes
is which components are being mounted to
which boards but otherwise for either
product the same steps apply so let's
start a tour with the SMT lines these
surface mount technology lines are
arranged in eleven identical rows
stretching halfway across the factory
floor and containing mostly identical
machines for each row as some tea lines
are fed with service mount components
like small
resistor is MOSFET so forth so that the
components can be placed on the board
these are provided in spools and reels
by third party suppliers allowing the
machines to maximize efficiency since
spools are replaced by hand but they can
still feed through thousands upon
thousands of components before being
replaced each motherboard made in this
line has between 1200 and 2400 service
mount components on it depending on the
board complexity but something like the
z3 90 godlike using more parts than most
today we're following the B 360 gaming
three at least for this floor the first
step is for the blank PCB typically
delivered from a PCB supplier in China
to be loaded into trays that the SMT
line pulls from each board is set onto a
conveyor belt via automation where the
blank PCBs first stop is to go through a
solder paste machine the solder paste
machine can process about 150 boards per
hour using a screen to apply a paste to
the correct areas of the board later in
the process solder paste will be used to
secure components and connect them to
the board but for now it's just getting
applied and one board takes about 24
seconds to go all the way through this
machine the screen is cleaned every 10
minutes to ensure it doesn't get
gunked-up it can be thought of sort of
like a silk screen for printing shirts
so that be about once every 25 boards
for cleaning the screen after the solder
paste machine an automatic optical
inspection machine or Aoi machine is
used to ensure each solder ball has
solder paste applied this is done with
either 2d or 3d Aoi machines with a
ladder being more expensive and more
detailed MSI primarily showed us it's a
3d Aoi machine called VTR 7007 s2 plus
which can check data for every single
pad on the motherboard
after the motherboard passes initial Aoi
it's fed into the next set of SMT
machines for surface mount components
these machines are called pick-and-place
machines named for their obvious tasks
in the service mount line pick-and-place
machines go through reels upon reels of
components starting first with these
smaller parts and graduating to larger
components later down the line each
section of the pick-and-place machine
takes about
seven to twenty seconds for mid-range
motherboards or video cards but cycle
time loss is reduced to about three
percent as a result of running at two
different internal conveyor systems in
parallel each station in the line is
responsible for about 100 components
with 15 stations in the SMT line total
components are loaded via reel and spat
out rapid-fire almost like a Gatling gun
with each reel of components containing
about 10,000 pieces so these also
include pre-programmed BIOS chips which
happens in another section of the
testing floor we can show that as well
the BIOS programming machine will write
BIOS to the chips and prepackaged them
into a real format and once the reel is
full a technician wheels it over to the
SMT line to be fed into the machine and
placed onto the motherboard for the
video card at this point in the process
the components are placed on the board
in the solder paste but they aren't
really secure the last item is to place
the socket which goes onto the BGA for
the CPU pin array the socket is
contained in a tray format rather than a
real format as it's the largest
component on the board so it goes at
last this order of smallest to largest
is partly done so that the machines can
work lower down with those Gatling gun
outputs sitting closer to the board so
that it can work faster and more
efficiently only having to elevate the
machinery toward the end of the line the
next machine is the reflow machine which
accepts parts via conveyor belts from
the 15 pic and Playstations the reflow
machine heats the motherboards or video
cards to about 250 to 200 67 degrees
Celsius and an oven
joining the solder pastes the pads and
the components to the PCB the oven used
here is a 1913 Mark 3 and takes about 5
minutes to heat the solder and secure
all the parts to the board the conveyor
belt trudges along next bringing the
mostly completed board down the line to
skilled technicians who hand test the
products to ensure that they function
and have some level of required quality
the motherboards are plugged into semi
custom circuit testers ensuring that
everything is connected and detecting
properly with one technician manually
overseeing the automatic optical
inspection results to check for false
positives
the entire start-to-finish process is
about 30 minutes for this part of
manufacturing but we're still missing
the PCIe slots the batteries and the
heat sinks we also still need to follow
the boards through the testing process
as the board's finished this part of the
process they are lightly packaged to be
transferred to upstairs to the dip line
or dual inline packages so now we're up
on the next floor of the building and
this section is going to be dip and
testing as well so part of this is going
to be more pic in place on machines more
Aoi opt or optical inspection and then
manual placement too so you'll see we'll
talk through some of how the PCIe slots
are actually placed manually and so are
the CMOS batteries for example the
battery container anyway and some of the
other larger components power pin outs
for example so about 30 percent of the
process is automated but then the rest
is still done by hand and after
everything goes through pick-and-place
and and through inspection and through
finalization of the board you end up
with a finished product which we'll talk
through that but that process about 10
minutes and then the process on the
floor we just saw is maybe about 30
minutes so it's actually a fairly long
start to finish process and actually the
boards up here are from the previous day
so what they do is they go through one
board at a time on the whole line then
they bring it up they go through one
board at a time on the next line and so
it's about a one-day latency between the
two and after all of this stuff is
testing so let's let's talk through the
process on this floor as well and get to
some of the new research for the
automated testing machines including
stuff that I want like automated
placement of memory modules and CP is
the station right now is a demo of an
old testing station from gigabyte so
this is how it used to be done versus
how it's done today which he just saw
probably in the previous part of this
video and all this stuff here is what
was manually tested by the people
working at the station so test every
single cable every output you have all
the ps2 cables audio cables old old old
USB cables stuff like that this was done
manually the CPU cooler is installed
manually memories installed manually I
mean it's basically you were building a
whole computer just to test it and make
sure the motherboard works which is
clearly inefficient so gigabyte improved
and moved on to
the next step which was a gigabyte
designed function box they call it and
so what this did was allow that gigabyte
to pre mount some of the hardware the
fixed hardware like video cards the
cooler to this sort of acrylic glass top
piece and then close it down and clamp
it onto the motherboard here and that
would allow several of the pieces to
remain unchanging and then the user only
has to manually change a few pieces like
CPU memory things like that and then the
fixed items up here just close down on
top of it and it reduced the workload
now this is about ten years ago now the
stuff we saw a second before that even
longer ago and obviously gigabytes
improved a lot of the last station here
is just for training purposes so this
would train the technicians which cable
goes where which device goes where and
if something was inserted incorrectly
then you'd get an LED light up to say
hey that's wrong so that they could
correct it so this is this is then and
the previous parts of the video you've
seen the upgrades we're now gigabyte is
moving towards more test automation
including placement of things like the
memory modules the next line starts with
more pick-and-place machines with
hoppers used to distribute some smaller
components down to machines that place
them into the motherboard an operator
can dump small components into the
hopper for automatic placement while the
machine uses sort of an ammo belt for
more SMD placement across the board as
for the big connectors those get placed
by hand
the assembly lines he's skilled workers
placing DVI connectors PCIe slots CMOS
batteries and power connectors by hand
as these components aren't sized in a
way that the machines can really pick
them up large ventilation systems are
used to pull solder fumes away from the
operators and safely exhaust them out
away from the assembly line and it keeps
the operation moving smoothly throughout
the day while ensuring that it's still a
safe work environment gigabyte sends the
boards through another optical
inspection line to check if the
components are present or not it's just
a 1 or 0 here with any boards detecting
as missing components being sent to
manual inspection for human oversight
sometimes there are false positives and
sometimes it just needs to be sent
through for a component that got missed
the socket is protected with a cover for
these steps as the pins in the path
are obviously fragile and now that the
sockets on the board they need to be
preserved each motherboard has serial
numbers and they can be tracked start to
finish so in the event of an RMA
gigabyte can actually backtrack to see
if something in the assembly process
specifically caused the issue and so if
there's some sort of assembly line error
or machine error it can be corrected
quickly and tracked easily finally
heatsink and wireless modules are placed
in manually and then the board is ready
for the next line this entire process
the one we just showed takes about ten
minutes counting the SMT lines from the
day prior that put the total motherboard
build time from start till now at about
forty to fifty minutes depending on how
you count the transit time from floor to
floor just counting the lines that we've
shown thus far gigabyte process is about
600 to 800 motherboards per hour for
about 5000 per eight-hour workday which
means that in the time that we were
there alone gigabyte went through
thousands of motherboards or video cards
in its factory finally after all of this
the motherboards are sent to the
packaging line the Box folding machine
was unfortunately not in operation
during our visit but we have footage of
it from our 2016 visit that shows the
machine working once the box for the day
is built by the machine it's sent down
the assembly lines of staff who
individually packed the manuals CDs USB
keys warranty cards and the motherboards
or video cards themselves into the box
and that box building machine is pretty
cool it's basically just a giant punch
and it's got a templated cardboard box
that it can work with making it fairly
easy to assemble
during our visit this year the line was
packing video cards rather than
motherboards and these video cards are
getting boxed and shipped out to various
regions we saw some boxes for Holland
some for the US and so forth each video
card box exits the line and is manually
placed into a larger cardboard box to be
palletized and shipped internationally
that box then rolls down the line it
gets automatically taped and it also has
straps applied automatically to ensure
security of the box make sure nothing
falls out loose and finally it exits the
line and that would be the end of the
motherboard or video card manufacturing
process
and that's the end of the product line
so some video cards here they didn't
have motherboards today because it
changes based on the day but that covers
gigabytes factories so thank you for
