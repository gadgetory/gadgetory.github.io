nexus dotnet and today we're talking
about EVGA gtx 980ti hybrid video card
and this video card is a hybrid card in
the sense that it uses two forms of
cooling is a liquid cooler an AC LC or
closed-loop liquid cooler and it also
uses a blower fan with the traditional
aluminum heatsink design and it cools
the vrm and vram modules that way with
the CL c being used for the GPU itself
the 980ti hybrid is the same as all
other 980ti is it's the same GM 200 chip
it's the same 28:16 CUDA cores the only
major difference here other than the
cooler is that it has a slightly boosted
core clock and boost clock when shipped
as the EVGA model so this card we have
here is shipped at 11:40 megahertz the
reference design just for frame of
reference is a 1,000 megahertz clock so
we've got a boost of 140 over reference
and then the boost clock of EVGA is unit
is 12 28 megahertz over the 1075 of the
reference design so it doesn't sound
like a huge number and in my previous
overclocking video I showed that on the
reference design you can actually
achieve a 1440 40 megahertz overclock
with the 980 TI and that's a pretty
substantial overclock with actually
substantial increases in framerate as
well but we were thermally limited there
was a thermal ceiling because the
reference cooler although it is pretty
good for what it is was not capable of
allowing an extreme overclock on the 980
TI it just it's too hot it's pushed to
its limits so that's where EVGA is 980ti
hybrid comes in and that's what we're
reviewing today looking at the thermal
is the power draw and the frame rate
performance EVGA is hybrid 980ti is a
$770 video card so that puts about 120
dollars over the reference design which
is a 650 dollar card and if you already
own the reference card you can purchase
the modding kit which is basically just
this faceplate the underlying mounting
bracket and the CLC and a stack CLC for
$100 so that's a slightly better deal
whether or not the card itself is worth
it is something we'll
momentarily but those are your two
options if you're looking into a
liquid-cooled gtx 980ti right now and
overclocking is the same as with all
other maxwell overclocking i've talked
about this for about a year now hasn't
changed so you've got your power percent
target which you can increase to 110
percent on this card and some cards
needle again or 25% that just means you
have 10 percent or 25 percent in those
two examples over the base TDP of the
card to supply more wattage to the card
for overclocking you can change the
voltage of course for increased overhead
and stability and you can change the
core clock and memory clock that's all
there is to it
pretty straightforward but the power
percent target is the one item that has
changed overclocking reasonably for the
Maxwell series this overclocking table
shows our stepping for the overclocking
and you've got the pass and fail here on
the right side the far right is the
endurance test the second to the most on
the right is the short-term test about
five minutes of burnin just to make sure
it's stable before we move to the
endurance test and on the 980ti hybrid a
final value of a 160 megahertz to offset
resulted in a 15 14 megahertz max clock
the reference card rested at 255
megahertz offset or 1444 megahertz max
clock and the reason the offset is
higher for the reference card is simply
because the base frequency for the
reference card is lower than the EVGA
hybrid which is 11 40 megahertz which is
a thousand so you've got a 140 jump
there in this thermal stable this is a
new one I'm doing it's thermals over
time so you see temperature which is
delta T over ambient over time and
ambience 21c source subtracting that
from the absolute temperature which
gives us the delta so we're subtracting
ambient here and in the thermals table
you're looking at now the orange and
green represent the hybrid and the
reference card is shown in red blue and
purple and then you've got your legend
on the right side the clock for clock
reference is in green and purple and
that's going to be the most linear for
the reference versus hybrid in terms of
thermals because we set the clock
authentically to each other that way you
look in strictly at the cooler
performance itself so we see how well
does the CLC perform how well does the
air + aluminum heatsink perform in the
clock 4 o'clock testing this test takes
place over 20 minutes it's automated so
it lines up almost perfectly to the
second and because of this we can see
that the CLC cooled unit this one is
actually slower to heat up so it's it's
not only a lower temperature overall but
it takes longer to achieve its maximum
temperature this next chart shows the
delta T over ambient average values once
equilibrium is reached so we wait until
there's equilibrium so basically when
the CPU or in this case the GPU sits at
something like 80 Celsius before
subtracting ambient and it just sort of
stays there take all those numbers
average them and produce this delta T
over ambient average chart and this
shows that the 980ti hybrid ad stock
settings 1140 megahertz runs at 20 2.91
Celsius and the overclocked version at
15 14 megahertz a pretty big jump is
that 24 Celsius reference is nearly
three times as hot in the 60s
delta T and it's not quite dangerous but
it is definitely a limiter and because
this is delta T you need to remember
that 60 something Celsius measurement is
actually 80 in the real world for a
standard 70 degree Fahrenheit home if
you're seeing that at that range ambient
your overclocked and and reference
performance will be at around 80 Celsius
pretty hot and it's approaching the 90
Celsius TJ Max limiter that Nvidia sets
power consumption is effectively
identical across all devices tested
there's no disparity that's noteworthy
here
I think the worst-case scenario is 7
watts which is pretty insubstantial this
point and is within the margin of test
error because we're manually logging the
wattage drawn over time so basically the
same which makes sense because we're all
we're doing is changing the cooler we're
not changing the GPU itself and finally
here are a couple of game benchmarks
showing the FPS performance of various
games for the most part the hybrid card
exceeds Titan X Performance pre
overclocked and where it doesn't
is very close to beating the Titan X
card grid Autosport is sort of a weird
game and that the Titan X always
performs better than the 980ti even when
that's not true in other games we test
applying overclock puts the 980ti
reference and 980ti hybrid close to each
other in performance but keep in mind
that the temperatures are 3x on the
overclocked reference cards so even
though the performance is pretty much
the same which may make it hard to
justify the cost the part that matters
here is the thermals and over time if
you're overclocking any kind of
semiconductor GPUs and CB is included
they lose some of their lifespans so
it's very aggressive on a semiconductors
life to overclock it and over volt it
especially and that's because you're
increasing the heat to the device so
that's the core issue and increasing
voltage just isn't something that they
like a whole lot of so to reduce the
heat using AC LC down to 20 Celsius
delta T is a pretty big deal and that
does mean that you have more overhead
for overclocking without the extra
concern of potentially killing your
device substantially early compared to
the reference card which is much hotter
we gave the gtx 980ti hybrid our
editor's choice and best of bench awards
for single GPU graphics card performance
the 980ti hybrid comes pretty close to
the Titan X they trade blows in a lot of
places but the 980ti even this one at
770 dollars is still a lot cheaper than
1,000 to $1,100 Titan X and that makes
it a pretty good buy it's also showing
that liquid is where the industry is
going for high on GPUs this is something
that is consistent with Andy's own
pushes Andy going with liquid for the
fury X and all the other fury cards and
even though 390 X in some cases so
liquids a big deal and the cooling
performance is absolutely noteworthy the
gaming performance is it's good it is
worth know but it's not nearly it's sort
of eclipsed by the cooling performance
and then power consumption is basically
the same so that's where we are with the
980ti hybrid check out the article in
