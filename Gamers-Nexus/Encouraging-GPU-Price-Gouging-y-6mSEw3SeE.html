rx 570 from at best buy for only $279
and get the quake champions back free
good news at Best Buy has XFX Radeon rh5
70s back in stock and at a great price
of $279.99 whose side are you on
you can't both imply that retailers are
gouging consumers to rake in cash on the
mining boom and simultaneously promote
said retailers and gouged prices and
sales of which there are often 20%
discounts on something that's overpriced
by more than a hundred dollars already
it doesn't work these two ideas they
don't mesh together and it just looks
two-faced and here's the thing these
tweets from AMD they're promoted in rx
570 it is cheaper than it was
technically but it's still encouraging a
price which is fully a hundred dollars
over amis RP and not just over MSRP but
over what the card used to be available
at before all the mining business that's
not to say it's Andy's fault that the
prices are high Andy keeps trying to say
that it's not their fault in fact they
have implied maybe not directly said on
record but there's the implication and
all of the statements that have gone out
to different publications that look this
is the retailer's gouging or someone
else in the chain ultimately you've got
AMD who work with Global Foundries and
all of them and these ships to someone
AIB partners distributors suppliers
retailers they're all in the chains
someone in there charges more but to
then go and promote those higher prices
after sort of indirectly condemning them
it doesn't sit right and the thing is
that ultimately Andy is publicly
encouraging these higher prices but
Andy's in a tough spot let's be fair to
them here AMD has to promote their
partners they can't very well say Best
Buy is gouging you don't buy from them
that that probably wouldn't be go over
to
well and Andy doesn't have the command
to do that type of thing so it's a hard
spot they can't just straight condemn
the prices and the retailer is calling
them the cause of the price but they
also have to you know they have to sell
a product and also have to look good to
consumers and part of looking good to
consumers is saying we're on your side
we we don't set these prices we don't
control the prices we are at the whim at
the command of the retailer is that the
distributor is that the AIB partners
whomever in the chain is causing this
increase and likely it's a bit
everywhere all the way down the line
there's probably slide increases that
amount to this $100 up charge on a video
card which is active at launch anyway
was actually a great value
$280 oh no way don't do not buy an Rx
574 $280 please don't do that please
MD has now become the proverbial
accessory to a crime against consumers
Best Buy might be robbing the bank
but Andy is holding the bag open as the
retailer furiously stuffs it with cash
and these tweets are openly encouraging
these inflated prices and that's just a
few months after condemnation to a
roomful of press using such phrases as
we can't hold the gun to the retailer's
heads to get the price down implied so
there are two different stories here
this is the rx 570 when we reviewed it
just to remind everyone before people
start screaming chill because we're
pointing out something which is clearly
a bad deal right now to remind everyone
the rx 570 was pretty highly received so
was the 470 in fact with our outlet and
the price then was about $180 it kind of
spiked up to 200 and sadly if you go
look at the review we thought 200 wasn't
overcharged we thought that was
retailers cashing in or bored partners
cashing in well how little we knew about
what would happen eventually but that's
not the point the point is that at the
180s $200 mark it wasn't a bad Buy you
could more or less equalize for the
missing shaders on the 570 versus the
580 by overclocking just like the 56
versus the 64 that's how these cards
tend to work so it was a good deal it
out
formed the 1050 TI somewhat
significantly at times you're looking at
with a 1050 TI you got anywhere from 58
to 75% of the performance of the 570 and
it was only about $30 cheaper at the
time so you're looking at a almost a
dollar-for-dollar performance increase
in some titles and even better in many
cases now though that card has stayed
about the same $145
but the 570 has gone up to 280
apparently on sale with quake and you're
still at the same performance difference
58 to 75% of a 574 now half the price
but even a 1050 TI we don't have to stop
there you look at a 10 63 gigabyte and
this isn't to say nvidia is the better
Buy it's this well I guess it sort of is
because when you're looking at prices of
$280 for what effectively constitutes
some performance in between a 10 to the
TI and a 10 60 that's a really bad deal
and gamers shouldn't be buying into it
and ultimately everyone says vote with
your wallet but there's more to that
than just voting with your wallet you
have to look out for yourself as a
consumer if $280 is considered a good
price when it was a lot less than that
previously even if it seems like a good
price now that doesn't mean you have to
buy it if you desperately need a GPU
consider the alternatives consider used
consider pulling one out of one of your
old systems and using it while we wait
for things to calm down either mining
calms down or it keeps taking off like a
rocket and AMD and NVIDIA combat Moore's
apply one of those two things should
happen eventually so you wait for one of
those two things or you buy an
alternative 1063 gigabyte cards are
still $210 and some are the plus or
minus 10 bucks on that and they
outperform in rx 570 in nearly all games
that we've tested 1066 gigabyte cards
are presently about $280 coincidentally
that is the cost of the rx 570 with Best
Buy's very generous discount of 20% off
of an overpriced upcharge
about 80% so thank you best buy we
appreciate that really great to know
you're looking out for consumers and
Andy it's great to see that you
encourage those up charges Andy may be
obligated to share that information they
might have an agreement with us by they
might have a social media exchange of
some kind with XFX no matter where you
look at it AMD's in a heart spot but
that doesn't excuse what amounts to
really just encouraging ripping off the
consumer that's what this is at this
point and it's sad because Andy tried to
take the stance of we're on the
consumers side things are overpriced we
can't control it look we'll try and pump
out more supply we'll try and fix this
and then they promote it so again I ask
whose side are you on
pick one so here's the other aspect of
this looking out the deal so you go to
the page that they link to first of all
there's a typo it says you get a game
code for the ps3 that's it's actually PC
it'd be kind of stupid if you bought a
video card for a PC we got a game code
for a ps3 so maybe maybe check that Best
Buy the other thing is it's a $30 value
game code that's not a it doesn't make
the deal any better but if you go look
at Newegg and how they value that code
nuoc values at it at more than you pay
on Steam to get the full game all of it
not just the character pack whatever
which basically constitutes the entire
game today but you look at the retailers
and they value these codes that am these
bundling with the stuff as higher than
the actual cost of those games to buy
and that's to make it look like a better
deal it's again comes back to the mining
situation where offsetting the price by
that much extra helps offset the value
theoretically so someone like a miner
but it also is just flat wrong that's
not the price of the product so you
can't just fudge the price until it fits
whatever narrative you're trying to sell
so that's on Newegg for that one the
best buys got their own problems Andy
clearly has their own problems they all
have problems in this chain
what I'm trying to say is you don't need
to feed into it - just because AMD and
Best Buy together are now trying to
create a new norm of the rx 570 being
$280 as the new norm and trying to make
everyone feel like that is the that's a
good price that's the right price to pay
for it don't feed into it just wait wait
for the prices to come down buy
something else
buy you rip something out of another
system using IGP whatever but feeding
into that is only going to perpetuate it
what needs to happen is these companies
need to learn if supply is so much of an
issue maybe consider that either you set
your prices higher or you make more of
the product so that's all this is about
it's about just you know look out for
yourself when buying a card right now
and it's sad it's it's disappointing I'm
disappointed that a card which was very
competitive and good the RX 570 at its
launch price is now being promoted so
much higher than it used to be and there
are a lot of people who should receive
blame for that but I mean you look at it
this way the 1063 gigabyte cards if you
need a video card today
they're 210 plus or minus 10 bucks on
average the gtx 1066 gigabyte cards are
the same price as the 570 and remember
the the 570 doesn't compete with a 1060
the 580 or 480 was the intended
competitor to the 1016 so doing a
head-to-head price match right now is
not where the competition is it you have
to look at the initial launch and who
the intended competitor was in terms of
card and it wasn't the 574 the 1060
that's not how it ever was until just
recently so anything else is just trying
to change the story and manipulate it
into a point where you feel like as a
consumer these cards are price match so
they compete so I should buy the one
that well whatever it has that you want
to buy but that's not the reality of it
the reality is 1066 a good bite is 280
bucks and so is the
17 the five 80s are still outrageously
overpriced you can blame whoever you
want for that retailers are certainly a
large part of it again look at new egg
Vega 64 just had its whole stock
refreshed it looks like ase pushed out a
lot of the cards that were stuck in
packaging and assembly
well they arrived that new egg and
they're still priced about a hundred
dollars more than they should be to be
fair they include the game pack which
has questionable value but either way
it's a hundred over MSRP and that's with
a whole new refresh of stock of Vega 64
so clearly folks like new AG are
partially to blame their distributor
might be to blame we can't just put it
on a new egg or Best Buy who knows what
their distributor is charging who knows
what the AIB partners are charging we
kind of know what the AIB partners are
paying you can see our what does HBM to
cost video for that but there's a lot of
it gets muddy in between AI B's
retailers and what we end up paying
who's taking all the extra cash but
either way it doesn't have to be taken
if you don't buy the card so I don't
know I guess it just bothered me that
personally speaking that coming from an
official Twitter account from a company
that has more or less implicitly stated
that the prices are being gouged out of
the control of said company Andy it
bothers me that they would go tweet and
promote those inflated prices there's a
disconnect there and it may come down to
legal having a contract with Best Buy
and XFX saying we got it we got to
promote this we have MDF with them we
have agreements with them we have agreed
to exchange social media exposure and as
such we get these deals or these rebates
or whatever it may be
that might be the case that doesn't make
it cool though so I don't know thank you
for watching I don't have much else to
say on this was just kind of frustrating
to me to see that after all this
back-and-forth with AMD officially with
back-and-forth with a Ivey partners
officially or unofficially you hear the
story as one thing being we're looking
out for consumers we can't control this
and then you
see the reality of it on a Twitter
account so Andy if it appears like I'm
frustrated it's because I am I'm sorry
but I'll tell you what it appears like
the Andy accounts are doing it looks
two-faced so whether or not that's the
intention perhaps consider the
perception of what's going on rather
than the intention behind the scenes now
you're all for watching you can
subscribe for more or go to
patreon.com/scishow feud like to help us
out directly these types of videos I'm
sure don't make friends at the companies
but also things have to be said
sometimes and mining is a good enough
cover for some things but not for this
I'll see you all next time
there's a bug did you see it on my
