as always leave your questions in the
comment section below for the next
episode we have three we're shooting
today so there's this one there's the
next episode that'll go live on the main
channel then we'll have a bonus episode
for patreon backers at patreon.com slash
gamers next is available to all tiers
you want access to that go over there
and support us there but today we're
gonna be talking about PCI Express 4.0
and a couple of other questions about
things like the GT 1030 that we covered
recently before that this video is
brought to you by thermal takes view 37
case the vo 37 focuses on highlighting
custom PC builds with its full panoramic
window and tinted front acrylic and our
thermal testing the view 37 performed
reasonably well when considering its
looks focused build which is partly
thanks to the airflow design and the
removal of a bottom power supply shroud
for a balance of looks and performance
check the link in the description below
for the view 37 before our first
question a quick update on the shirt the
limited edition foil shirt we've sold a
lot of them almost too many at this
point it's already closing pre-order
soon if you want it we'll probably put
about another week on it or so and then
close it and then that'll be it so if
you want the shirt and you haven't
gotten one yet place your order on store
doc gamers Nexus not Annette it's a
limited edition foil version of our 10
year anniversary shirt and we should be
in production pretty soon we were just
getting a distribution of all the sizes
so we can accommodate whatever size you
want for the most part so grab that on
the store if you want it first question
is from south-eastern 777 who says Steve
when can we expect the rollout of PCIe 4
according to your best guess so yes this
is this is going to be based on research
and on what I know obviously I don't
have an exact timeline but I can give
you some basics so PC is Eiji the group
that actually ratifies and designs the
PCI Express interface and specifications
PCI SVG ratified and released their PCIe
4.0 spec in October of 2017 so last year
and at this point all the vendors have
it when they ratify and release a spec
it means that the motherboard vendors
got it
CPU vendors get it and a lot of these
people work with PC is IG while they're
designing it as well so they've all
known for a while what was on the way
but also at the same time when PCIe 4.0
was officially released as a spec PCIe
5.0 was fast-tracked for 2019
which is really not that far away at
this point so if it's kind of the same
release period you're looking at PCIe
5.0 specs coming out and maybe end of
year 2019 fourth quarter something like
that under third quarter what we know
now is that actually it is fast-tracked
for second to third quarter 2019 but we
know now though is that AMD wants to
support PCIe 4.0 they've publicly said
this in 2020 when they refresh their a
m4 or replace their a m4 platform so as
I am for fades out with the first round
of Rison CPUs and Xen architecture a
PCIe 4.0 should start coming in for AMD
PCI you 5 not sure I mean that'll be
after it's announced but probably too
close to release date for the next
platform for Andy so I would guess PCI
you for makes the most sense we're not
really at the limit of the interface
anyway it's not a big deal
and PCI you for just to give you an idea
anyone who doesn't know it's about a
doubling or so every every generation so
3.0 was 16 Giga transfers per second or
4.0 16 Giga transfers per second three
point I was eight and then five point I
was going to be 32 geget transfers per
second so you have 8 16 32 and we're
barely even kind of hitting the pcie 3.0
bandwidth with things like heavily
overclocked Titan V's and we're really
not for the most part and that's up with
16 lanes of course so multiply the lane
count by the Giga transfer number but at
16 lanes of PCI III there's really not a
huge rush to move the PCI you for anyway
it does look like 2020s around 1a and
he's gonna support it not sure about
Intel they might be a bit sooner
depending on what they're doing with
their next h EDT platform but we haven't
heard a whole lot yet so that's kind of
the timeline and then PCIe 5 not too
long after that PCIe 4 will not live as
long as 3.0 which I think is noteworthy
3.0 has been around
a long time now two point one was around
for a long time but five is gonna come
out pretty close after four and replace
it and whatever the next platform is
after those next question Trapper John
says okay so now I'm curious and have a
question maybe for asked yen do you ever
worry that a video will make you look
like a shill even though you're not
I noticed you chastised Nvidia for the
GT 1030 that's appropriate I'll leave it
there garbage right after saying their
NDA was no big deal was that on purpose
also I would pay for a shirt that says
Steve Burke says what the hell he wants
on camera but please don't make it black
because I'll melt okay so I guess I'll
quickly note we did actually introduce a
blue shirt The Blueprint shirt is back
in stock now if you wanted it it was out
of stock but we've just restocked it on
the store so if you don't like the
darker colors because it's too hot where
you live or something that I guess we
have a blue one for you but yeah so just
some background here for everyone
basically we released the GT 1030 video
saying that the ddr4 1030 is bad don't
buy it I think the day after we release
the video about the NDA being no big
deal because it's not and also the ddr4
1030 is bad so both those things are
definitely true and the NDA I think got
way more blown out of proportion than it
ever deserved but part of that is the
culture around sort of opposing the
larger company in the space and then
part of it is just because NVIDIA has
done some shady things lately referred
to the 10:30 with ddr4 and so people are
kind of on edge and on high alert so as
far as the question though do we worry
about looking like a shell when doing
videos the main way so the thing that
the answer is we do definitely work on
the video scripts in the video coverage
in a way that we're like thinking about
okay what are potential comments so we
can try and answer questions just in the
video and not have a bunch of questions
where we have to do follow-up video to
answer them so part of that's like
benchmark coverage part of it is test
methodology that's why we have the
articles with some of the testing
detailed so that if you have
questions on what CPU was used then you
can just go to the article and and find
that information so we do tailor the
content to try and address questions
before they're posted just to help
everyone and make things a bit more
streamlined and then in that process
we're also looking at what our potential
concerns people would have so I mean
yeah with the the GT 1030 video we shot
before we film the NDA on the NDA one
was kind of last minute it was super
rushed because it was a hot topic and we
were able to get the the lawyer who
spoke with us to call in and talk to the
subject kind of on last-minute notice
that was pretty rog GT 10:30 he's
already shot but I will say that we do
definitely consider when posting
something like saying the NDA is no big
deal of course we're sitting there
thinking the comments are gonna be like
at least a few of them will say you're
supporting NDA Nvidia and their NDA
you're supporting their actions you are
on their payroll all that kind of stuff
that we see all the time for any video
so of course that is considered there's
not a lot we can do about it other than
trying to be just as neutral as possible
releasing the 1030 video certainly helps
with tempering some of the people who
might be more extreme but there's only
so much you can do to deal with those
people who are just absolutely convinced
that you were out to get the company
that they decided they want to support
for absolutely no logical or rational
reason for the most part whatsoever so
ultimately no reason to be loyal to any
of these companies but some people get
so loyal to them that Nvidia Intel or
Andy that is just kind of I think blinds
their judgment to a point of posting
those comments and we can't do anything
about that so our goal basically to
answer the question of you know do we
worry about it or what do we do to deal
with it the answer is just remain as
neutral and objective and
straightforward as possible and as long
as I do that then I'm not really
concerned about it because at the end of
the day there's always going to be a
product where we say this is a good
product it's always gonna be one where
we say this is a terrible product and
it's probably gonna come from the same
company even so I mean all I can really
do is point to
and say well look we supported them
there and we opposed them here so what
more do you want from me so hopefully
that answers it basically it's something
we consider we don't tailor content
around it because I I mean I make the
content that I think you guys want to
see and I don't think anyone wants to
see content that's like had every line
poured over to make sure that it's not
gonna offend anyone because frankly I
don't care so we just focus on covering
the truth of whether it's good or not
and then the rest of it whatever it
doesn't really matter at that point next
question Oliver Wilton says what do you
use to find out why a cpu OC crashes
attempts are easy to see but what about
power needed what setting needs to be
changed et cetera
and at what point do you just say bad
luck on the silicon lottery also any
plans for some more thick gianna hoodie
is it gets cold here in England in the
winter yes we'll be introducing them
again towards winter so good timing on
that the question what do we do to find
out why an overclock crashes typically
the easiest thing to do is just change
one thing at a time
so as long as you're doing that if it
was stable before and you change voltage
then you pretty much know why it crashed
it's because you probably lowered the
voltage too much or if you increase
frequency but you keep the same voltage
you know why it crashed so as long as
you just do one thing at a time it's
it'll be fine you'll figure it out
pretty much immediately if you really
can't though like let's say and this
happens a lot let's say with the GPU OC
or Ram in particular you might have
settings that are perfectly stable and
your stability test if it's 3dmark or
whatever but then as soon as you start
playing actual games it'll crash for
seemingly no reason typically what I'll
do first of all for Intel X to you is
really good for Andy risin Masters okay
it's certainly gotten better but it
doesn't have some of the same reporting
features that X to you has that I want
so in either situation I would still
recommend Hardware info 64 it is great
software it's free it's a really good
monitoring utility and when you open it
you click on the sensors or just check
mark the box that says sensors only open
that it'll reduce confusion and as you
scroll down through the list you'll see
a whole bunch of items that are just
listed as yes or no and there'll be
thermal throttles
power throttles current throttles
voltage limitations stuff on GPUs like
nvidia gpus where you can't change the
voltage stuff like that GPU Z's also
really good on the GPU side if you want
to see the perf cap reason it's called
so it'll be something like V R L or
something like that and then you can
look up the the code and see what that
means in there basically forums or
manual online more or less so that'll
give you troubleshooting tools for
hardware info and 4x to you the big
thing to look at for those is the
current limit and the thermal limit and
if it says yes you're hitting the
current limit at any point during the
benchmark it'll stay in the maximum
column it'll stay as yes even though it
might not be hitting that limit when you
look at it so look at the maximum column
if you see any yeses for thermal or
current limits then reboot go into the
BIOS options disable current limit stuff
like that if you think it's safe to do
so it normally is for an asus
motherboard for example you go to the
digit plus vrm section i think a lot of
people don't even know that page exists
it's really important though go to that
page and you can change the DRAM current
limit cpu current limit for the core and
any other power limits in there just
disable them all or max them out be
careful about LLC be careful about
voltage as long as you're careful on
those two things you're not gonna hurt
anything so those the tools to use
hardware info 64 for both platforms for
Intel and AMD and also it's okay for
GPUs gpu-z is better for GPUs and CPUs
ease and ok tool just to check and make
sure your numbers are what you typed in
and bios but not great at sort of
debugging or troubleshooting and then
XTU is an Intel utility that's pretty
good
also at giving you what the error is the
hardware in foot does much of the same
and Rison masters ok
not my favorite they just kind of
started working on it in the last year
or so though so that'll improve but
hardware info is very good so hopefully
that helps I think as for at what point
do you say bad luck on the silicon
lottery from the same question I would
say bad luck on the silicon lottery at
the point where I've actually did this
recently with our one of our 8700 KS
where you increase the voltage to a
point where it's
no longer you're no longer comfortable
with it for daily use so I think I had
pushed one of our 8700 K's up to
something like one point four or five
volts for V core and high LLC and it
still wasn't taking five gigahertz
stable and so at that point you're kind
of like there's really not much else I
can do because one point four or five on
the high side Kandee let it complete
liquid metal on it I can put a huge
radio radiator on it and deal with the
thermals but if it's still not doing the
frequency you want then I mean that's
kind of it so that would be the point
basically as a the point at which
voltage no longer is a comfortable
setting for daily use and you can't
achieve a frequency that you think is
standard to achieve then I would say
that's the the point where you say bad
luck next question and that was a good
question by the way if anyone has more
software monitoring or logging utility
questions let me know
next one is from Stu I think this is on
the patreon discord who says what
accounts for discrepancies in the way
CPU clocks are reported this is also a
really good question
ie if at 4.5 gigahertz task manager will
say four point four nine rivatuner will
say four point four nine five CPU Z and
hardware info display accurate info
based on oh yeah this these are my notes
so so if you sit at let's say you said I
multiply our 45 and you think you have a
base clock of a hundred so that should
be about 4.5 gigahertz the reason some
of its rounding errors so the GPU z does
this too we're in old versions of gpu-z
I think this has since been corrected
I'm not sure some video cards would show
GPU load at 99% they would never go to a
hundred and that was a rounding issue so
it actually was a hundred but whatever
was going on in the Psalter was rounding
to 99 maybe maybe it was ninety nine
point six and it just decided to round
down instead of up or something like
that
so sometimes it's rounding errors task
manager is kind of buggy in general with
reading frequencies at times I don't
know if that's rounding or what
specifically that is but I can speak to
CPU Z and actually just motherboards
let's start with motherboards so
motherboards it might say a hundred
megahertz for your base clock in BIOS
and INRI or if you left it auto it's you
would assume it's a hundred
but the thing is motherboards have
variants on the base clock and this is
actually a point of discussion for the
motherboard vendors where they've
they've been talking lately about MCE
and whether it should be on or off but
there's a new thing and heads up I guess
at this point where BC LK they are now
discussing okay if MC e is off what if
we just enable a higher BC LK what if we
push to one hundred point five instead
of a hundred or even we'll probably stop
at a hundred point five some of them are
bouncing around between 98 and 100 or
100 point five so a lot of what you're
seeing is gonna be the the ratio is
correct but the base clock is jumping
around and that's the motherboard vendor
at I guess you could say fault but it's
not necessarily a fault if it's four
point four nine out of four point five
that's pretty good
so yeah base clock changes a lot if you
open up CPU Z you'll often see that it
says a hundred point something and when
it should be a hundred or 99 point
something I think that answers most of
the question also rounding errors next
one is from on Sun who says by the way
I'm very skeptical for nail polish for
CPUs I mean so close to the actual die
the temps are going to be close to 100
degrees Celsius I believe this should be
enough to make liquid again or if it's
not completely liquid maybe they have
viscosity to run down slowly and move
away from the capacitors so some
reference material here I think this is
in response to talk about liquid metal
or something or nail polish choices last
week for CPUs to protect the SMD is like
the small capacitors and things and the
theta is as far as melting or changing
its state you have to remember first the
die is probably not gonna be 100 C but
if it is because you've deleted it so
one would hope that it's transferring
heat pretty well if it is a hundred
degrees though that is basically
strictly on the cores on the die so it's
a it's pinpoint areas on the die it'll
spread over the die surface so you might
be in the nineties or whatever across
the whole die but as soon as you get off
that die and over to the the caps and
the SMD is that like on the X to 99 CPUs
they're pretty close but they're not
close they're far enough away from the
die that I mean that the temperature
drop is huge because it's no longer the
silicon so although the die is 100 it's
transferring that heat into the IHS
hopefully via liquid metal or something
and I actually definitely be a liquid
metal because otherwise you're probably
not using something to protect the caps
unless it's conductive thermal paste and
then all the other heat going over to
the SM Dee's it's gonna be low enough to
not really matter so I wouldn't worry
about it we've we've had CPUs X 299
including included running for like a
year now with liquid metal and with nail
polish on them to protect the SMD s and
there have been no problems the liquid
metal is still fine the nail polish is
still fine so you can use conformal
coating you can use captain tape stuff
like that
it's those will work pretty well but if
you already have like nail polish around
for example then that works just fine as
long as it doesn't have toluene in it
which can be pretty bad for the SMD s so
just check the chemical composition also
careful of things like acetone if you're
getting it off but next one is from
Bateman who says a lot of tech youtubers
have your mod Matt how do you feel about
this extra publicity it's pretty cool so
we sent it out like Linus has one of
them he he's shown that one a couple
times now I think actually speaking of
liquid metal in their recent whatever
video they were doing with liquid metal
it was in there so it's cool people seem
to actually like it we sent it to
youtubers that we know and work with and
basically asked them do you have any
feedback on how to improve this thing
for our next whatever mod Matt products
we do we were working on a medium for
example that will hopefully be in
production soon so we asked them for
feedback it was great to talk to people
who are professional products reviewers
and see what they had to say and
obviously we sincerely appreciate that
they actually like and use the product
and even show it on camera it's a nice
bonus but the coolest thing is that
these people who actually like do the
stuff we do everyday build computers
every single day basically are using it
as opposed to some other service I think
hopefully speaks to the quality and
it's also nice to have professionals who
can give us feedback if they think we
can improve something because it's I
mean it just means we can make a better
products much faster that way and then
last thing this wasn't a specific
question but there are a lot of them
just in general about like about this
shirt and about other products we have
while we're on the topic of the store so
we've seen a lot of questions about
shipping costs and duties and customs
and stuff like that
shipping cost the store will auto
calculate it before you buy so you can
see what it costs if you have a question
how much it cost to ship to your country
you can do that on the store and if you
don't like it that's fine we get it just
back out and then any other questions
we'll do our best to help you
I don't know customs regulations for
every country obviously but we can try
and help you just email support at
gamer's axis net if you have a question
and we'll try and help you out there for
sure
so that's it for this one is always
patreon.com slash gamers Nexus tops out
directly or get access to the bonus
episode we'll have a second episode
that'll go live on the main channel
around the time this one does maybe plus
or minus I don't know 18 hours or so and
store dock guarantees access dot net to
pick up this shirt before it's gone
probably closing pre-orders in about a
