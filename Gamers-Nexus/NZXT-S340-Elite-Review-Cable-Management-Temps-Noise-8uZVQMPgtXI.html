have found themselves confused by sudden
influx of tempered glass orders from
computer case makers we started with a
review of Rose Wells Cullinan case which
we saw at combi Tex and is a Jones boat
design that's also solved by an ADIZ and
then we moved on to the n1 303 following
these two cases quartz saves brand new
570 X was featured in the mix we've
talked about the 460 X today we're
returning to the case world with a
review of NZXT is at latest s 340 case
the s 240 elite enclosure a refresh of
one of our long favored enclosures
before getting to that this coverage is
brought to you by AMD and it's rx 470
GPUs priced affordably only 160 to 180
dollar range of graphics cards check the
link in the description below for a
couple of holiday sales on our x4 70s
NZXT s340 elites builds upon the
existing foundation the s3 40 it
retooled a few things in the s3 40 so
we've got some changes made to the core
of the case the SD 40 elite next to me
is priced at around $100 MSRP and the s3
40 non-elite is priced at about 70 and
then just for kind of an idea of the
enclosure market with tempered glass
right now you've got things like the 570
X priced at around 170 180 dollars the
pending and the Corsair 460 acts a bit
cheaper the Roseville Cullinan in the
130 150 odd range and then this kind of
stands out mostly alone in the 100
dollar market three color options are
available for the s 340 elite flat black
black with red accents on the cable
management bar and white and black this
is a place where NZXT excels its
designers know how and where to apply
their accents and they help
differentiate the options even within
the brand so that users can feel a bit
more unique in their system builds as
for the s3 40 as a point of comparison
the biggest changes are pretty obvious
first of all glass side panel that's the
big one and then there's also new SSD
slat on the side of the power supply
shroud and in the power supply shroud
there are a couple of new cutouts for
cable pastors one obviously used for
that extra SSD sled and the others on
the top of the case there's one in the
front of the shroud so that you could
route something like a hue plus cable or
LED strip through there
if you wanted to those are the major and
obvious changes but some of the best
changes are actually a lot more subtle
and more important in our Coursera 570
extra view we said that NZXT destroys
its competition and cable management in
this case is why the s340 non-elite is
what innovated cable management bars in
mid towers and a five millimeter
expansion of that bar has been
implemented in the elite version of the
st 40 that better allows for bundling
large cables like your ATX 24 pin cables
and keeping them out of sight this is
further aided by exceptionally simple
but flawlessly executed cable management
clamps which again pretty simple it's
just a piece of plastic but it's
reusable and that's nice and it holds
cables in place well this eliminates of
course the need for zip ties and twist
ties that inevitably get cut as you make
changes to the case and it's cable
management layout one collet I have to
make here is that in our MSI Trident
review we just talked about how VR ready
is branding that's sort of thrown around
on everything now on things that even
with silicon only by technicality is VR
ready again like the Trident yeah it
works kind of but that's about the
extent of it
this is a case and although NZXT has
avoided use of the phrase v already they
still have in their marketing materials
let me get this right gets better with
VR so not that much better than VR ready
how then does this get better with VR
well let me show you a puck I can't tell
you how excited NZXT was to show us this
puck when we visited their offices
it is literally a piece of rubber with
magnets in it they're very happy about
it and it does this check this out
might have missed it but it's stuck to
the front of the case now so that is for
holding your HTC vive or oculus rift I
to NZXT is credit yet I guess a
high-quality magnet and rubber amalgam
it feels okay I guess but again magnet
and rubber this is not innovative
technology kind of a silly thing I can't
beat them up too much about it because
it's not really core to the case but I
don't know that I'd put it all over my
branding either because for NZXT it
makes far more sense to spend that
marketing air and that marketing
material on things they do well
like their cable management not things
like a puck alongside its hockey puck
NZXT furthers its VR branding by
building an an HDMI pass-through within
the case which passes your GPUs HDMI out
to the HMD through internal case wiring
theoretically this gets you an extra
foot or so of cabling but that's really
the start in the end of the feature and
considering the vast majority of users
of this case will not even own a VR
headset and further considering that
this case is not really positioned to
target non owners of VR headsets anyway
it does seem a bit superfluous and like
it's just trying to take another box
regardless just like there are better
places for ngiht to spend their time
there are better places for this review
to spend its time let's finalize the
specs and walk through the rest the case
and then cover the thermals G ends
criticisms for improving those thermals
and the conclusion the s340 elite
includes with it to fans and both are in
exhaust configuration both
120-millimeter top and rear of the case
if you're wondering why the setup was
chosen it's because the tempered glass
side panel extends all the way to the
front of the case blocking any chance
for side intake through the front panel
this is how the 570 X and the Cullinan
and most other cases breathe by the way
through side intake in front panels and
of course through the bottom and top if
there are cutouts there unfortunately
because the bottom of the case will
shoot all of its air unnecessarily to
the power supply breathing through the
bottom is sort of useless we'd have to
position a fan in the middle or the top
of the front panel to direct airflow
into components that actually matter but
again we're then relying on that cutout
in the top to breathe and that mostly
relegate sus2 awkwardly positioned
intake that will almost exclusively cool
the CPU clearly not the most important
component to cool since it's already the
most exposed to push its air outward
anyway let's look at how this performs
in benchmarking prior to further
analyzing the choice is made by NZXT as
always check the link in the description
below for our full testing methodology
and review article that contains more
depth the components used and the
approach to testing overall if you have
a question check their first starting
with CPU temperatures the s340 elite at
max rpm lens at around 50 5.8 Celsius
delta T when under load conditions this
positions the unit behind course there's
270 R a $60 case and well behind the 5
DX this is considerably worse than the
570 X's capabilities also at max rpms
but the 570 X is a far more expensive
case different market its larger and not
necessarily a direct comparison between
the two let's look at GPU temperatures
next the s 340 elite is better only than
the 570 X with its lowest fan speeds or
better than the TJ Max abusing and when
303 with 0 fans obviously want to buy
fans with that case the s340 elite with
a 1300 max rpm sits at 50 3.9 Celsius
delta T and it's complete lack of change
between fan RPMs if you look at the
numbers here you'll see they're
basically the same even with our
methodology which eliminates ambient
fluctuation demonstrate something
critical this lack of changing means
that the GPU is receiving exactly zero
benefit from the cooling solution
because changing the fan RPMs again
doesn't really impact the performance
the only reason we see any change is
because some of the hot air that
radiates off of the CPU cooler is being
drafted away from the PCB backplate and
if you live in an environment where
ambience is around 30 °c or higher any
GTX 10 series GPU will either boost its
fan speed or limit its clock speed to
handle this temperature since 81 to 83
Celsius should be pretty easy to hit
with high ambient in this case speaking
of here's a look at the case internal
ambient temperature is something we just
started measuring external ambient for
these measurements is in the range of
about 20 to 22 Celsius the SD 40 elite
is among the hottest cases on our bench
hitting about 46 Celsius internal
ambient when the thermocouple is
triangulated between the cpu GPU and the
front of the case this is not a delta
measurement by the way but rather an
actual temperature reading and ambience
in this case can easily drive GP
thermals up NZXT ends up a full 10
Celsius warmer than the 570 X and that's
again the most expensive case on the
bench but it's about 4 to 5 Celsius
warmer than B 270 R as for noise the SD
40 elite complete system runs a DBA of
about 38.1 when at its max fan rpm DBA
drops to thirty four point five when
running 810 50 rpm fan speed so it's a
bit quieter and part of this noise
output is because the fans are directly
against the top and the rear panels
which again exposes them a bit more
makes them a bit louder to the user NZXT
s340 elite has a clear disadvantage in
thermals it's not the most important
metric in the world for a case but still
you want to keep the GPU clear of any
unnecessary clock throttling and that's
going to happen if you're hitting 80 to
83 Celsius it's not for sure going to
happen with a single GPU configuration
but we're riding that line enough where
it's something that deserves some notice
at least something to talk about and
explain how this could be improved on
the s340 elite so first of all the user
is obviously going to have either a
tower cooler or a liquid cooler there's
really the only two options especially
if you're spending $100 on a case you're
just probably not going to be using a
stock cooler even still that will fall
into what I'm about to say so with the
liquid cooler you're not worried about
air intake that much think about it
we put the radiator in the back of the
case and what happens the air goes out
the back the hot air goes out where does
the cooler air come from well we've got
this hole on the top let's assume
there's no fan there anymore there's a
hole in the top there's a fan right next
to it it will naturally at least draft a
little air in from the outside and the
rest will be relatively cool enough
anyway that the CPU will remain within
fair operating range CP is not quite as
important as GPU cooling because they
run cool enough anyway so that's what
you have with a liquid cooler with a
tower cooler it's got a fan strapped to
it probably a hundred twenty millimeters
maybe more it's going to just force that
air out of the back naturally there
doesn't need to be an exhaust down there
it helps it helps primarily in keeping
the heat from that's writing off of the
CPU cooler from warming up the PCB
backplate of the GPU but that's kind of
really a minor thing to complain about
because the greater gain would be again
no fan either back here or up here and
then intake but the problem is as I
discussed there's no side mesh for this
front panel so what do we end up with
well there's no way for the front fans
to breathe you put a fan on the bottom
it pushes all the air into the PSU
shroud doesn't do anything put in the
middle it can't breathe at all it's got
a pull air from way up here it's like a
foot away it's not going to do very well
put a fan at the top okay it'll do a
little bit but now you're only forcing
it straight into the CPU or the radiator
so again
who cares it doesn't help your GPU so
what do we do well in both of these
configurations there's an obvious
missing link intake there's no intake in
the case so that's okay I guess for dust
but if you hope to run a I see SSDs in
the lower PCIe slots you're kind of
screwed and the same is true if you have
a multi GPU set up you just don't want
to run them in an s3 40 elite because
it's going to hamstring performance and
it will choke the clock rate those GPS
won't get enough air they will suffocate
and that's whether you have an AIC or a
second GPU and this doesn't have to be a
sacrifice of looks for performance
either it's something that NZXT could
learn a bit from in the market they do
great with their design with their
aesthetic they're really on point with
that stuff especially cable management
but they don't have cooling quite
figured out yet so here's how I would
improve this case instantly you take the
front panel it can stay steel doesn't
matter if this is remain steel but this
sort of one inch gap right here just put
it on something like this and now you've
got a grille side and you can take air
in through that and have a fan whatever
you want it'll be able to breathe
reasonably and you'll have a full one
inch to breathe that's plenty of space
to bring air into the system as intake
that's how you improve it and even again
stock if you had a setup like this it
would make sense to ship the case with
maybe a dual intake front setup or one
intake fan on the front maybe in the
front middle and then one exhaust fans
who are maybe in the back and it would
be miles better than this current setup
let's wrap this up the s340 elite does
some things brilliantly it's cable
management is best-in-class hands down
no one does cable management at this
price point better than NZXT right now
Corsair has a lot to learn in this
department similarly and exe has a lot
to learn and cooling as we just said so
to each their own pass throughs in the
PSU shroud are also well positioned if
beginning to look a bit like a designer
t-shirt with all the holes in it it's
still functional and the plastic clamps
are perfect to accompany those on the
back side of the case the interior is
clean the tempered glass checks a box I
guess and the ease of installation is
also in the top tier of enclosures NZXT
does well to hit the small points like
exposing expansion slot screws so that
you can actually get at them with a
perpendicular angle
unlike competitors who favor cross
threading as a means to get this
out of the case that said NZXT again has
some to learn from Corsair just like
Corsair some to learn from NZXT I only
mention those two explicitly because
they are sort of the direct competitors
in their respective markets and both
have been on our benches lately
obviously there are people like fan tax
and fractal who deserve attention but
just haven't tested any of their most
recent cases so then let's keep it to
those two competitors right now Corsair
kills NZXT and cooling performance they
destroy them and if NZXT would just make
that so the front panel could breathe a
little bit better and move their fans
they'd be fine they'd be pretty
competitive with Corsair and again
cooling not the most important metric in
a case but we're using decently cooled
components and they're still kind of
making me feel a little uneasy at least
on the GPU side with regard to thermals
if you had a high ambient environment
which 30c in some regions of the world
is not unreasonable so it could be
improved and that's not a bad thing
there's always something to improve on
for NZXT it's cooling likewise as an
enclosure the s340 elite is really
competitive at its price point it's $100
case it's unbeatable in terms of cable
management and ease of installation
maybe not unbeatable
I'm sure there's well there is stuff
that's easier to work with but for the
price it's pretty damn good you're not
going to be complaining about installing
a system in this case so the feature
list is good given the price point
there's not much nearby competition you
have stuff like the in win 303 certainly
deserves mention it's a bit cheaper but
it comes with no fans so you do have to
add to the cost at least two fans
because otherwise it's a hot box and
will incinerate your components so I had
two fans of that maybe plus 10 to $15
for cheap ones and it's pretty directly
competitive with this case in terms of
price point so that deserves mention if
you don't know about it look up the n1
303 we even have review on it the
Corsair 460 X deserves mention that's
another similarly priced case it's
tempered glass it's more expensive but
it's not too distant from this one like
the 570 X's next one the Rosewood
Cullinan if you really like tempered
glass and you kind of like this that
one's got more of it so depending on how
much you like tempered glass that's
worth a look it's $130 right now 150
sometimes so it's kind of within reach
of this case but this one is still
among the best-designed tempered glass
cases at its price point at $100 not
much comes close to right now some out
there but not a whole lot
so NZXT has done well at improving what
they're good at again table management
big steps forward especially at $100
again it's really not a bad Buy and I
would recommend it but just be aware
that you should not build in here with a
multi GPU set up with an AIC in front of
your GPU or if you're just running fat
video cards and you're going to be
cramped against the power supply shroud
anyway so those are the caveats other
than that it's an okay case and might as
well look into it so thank you for
watching as always pay channeling the
postal video for more information link
in the description below for the full
review and the test methodology I'll see
you all next time
most important metric in the world for a
case normally looks kind of trumps that
I should avoid that word right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
