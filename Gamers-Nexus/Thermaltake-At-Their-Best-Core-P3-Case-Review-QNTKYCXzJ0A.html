most unique chassis to come out of the
company in the last few years and is one
that ironically others in the industry
could stand to learn from the p3 is a
case with flexible uses including open
air test bench applications wall mounted
installation or standard upright mid
tower build formats today we're
reviewing the core p3 for build quality
assembly thermals and noise as it
compares to other cases on the market
before getting set this content is
brought to you by v1 tech comm who make
the custom back plates shown in our
b-roll on the screen of the MSI gaming X
they've also got plenty about the
backplate so you can go to their website
and use code gamers Nexus 5 for $5 off
click the link of the description below
for more information so this is the
thermal take core p3 it follows up the
core p5 which was a bigger version of
this case and following this one was the
core p1 that we saw at CES including the
core p1 T g2 letters there and the T G
means tempered glass so there is a
tempered glass add-on you can buy for
this but it technically shows with
acrylic panels and the tempered glass
out on is about $37 though the models
after this one including the core p1 T G
chip with tempered glass as a default
configuration other than that this is
one of those cases that's part of a new
up-and-coming trend of semi modular
design cooler masters a part of this
design where they have their master box
and master maker cases and other
products in that line where there's at
least some level of appearance of
modularity whether or not they ever
expect you to use it and part of that
would be the 3d printing trend for
example when cooler master offers 3d
printing capabilities and printouts for
a $50 case because anyone buying a $50
case will have a $2,000 printer but this
one is a bit different it does have the
semi modular approach but stick to a
more practical version of that for some
basic examples that there's the PCIe
riser cable here you can configure the
video card to either be mounted
vertically so that the face is outward
if you want to remove the glass you
could do that but you face it outward
and can position it in any one of the
normal PCIe expansion slots or you flip
it and do it horizontally and more of a
standard configuration without the riser
cable other than this there are options
for radiator mounting over here plenty
of drive cage support all with the SSD
logos facing outward which is just part
of the aesthetics thing and the case has
all kinds of open-loop support we test
with an air-cooled system for
standardization across all of the cases
that we review for noise and thermal
testing but this is really best
implemented as an open-loop case and
other than that it's got applications as
test benches that will go over here
because you could flip it and run it as
a standard test bench open-air on a flat
surface or run it like this the only
problem is it's a bit big if you go with
the horizontal orientation the quarter
p3 comes with a lot of loose parts and
it's not immediately obvious what to do
with all of them or what order they need
to be assembled in and for that reason
the manual is actually useful here
though it would be nice if a included
more Lego style instructions this
complexity is a direct result of the p3
adaptability the configuration that we
assembled and tested was a normal
upright mid tower but with the graphics
card it mounted sideways using the riser
cable for display purposes
alternatively PCI cards can be inserted
directly into the motherboard as usual
with a different arrangement of the
expansion slots drives can be mounted
either inside the case to hide them from
view or in the area it meant for the
radiator if it's not completely filled
and that offers that you the ability to
show off the drive power spot can be
mounted normally or sideways with an IT
exit board and there's an optional
bracket for a liquid cooling reservoir
which offers an impressive amount of
changes right out of the box but we
still have the test noise and thermals
of course room for maneuvering is never
an issue in a case with no sides but
this also means that it's very difficult
to flip the case over or mess with
cables until assembly is complete
putting the feet on after installing the
motherboard and standing the case on its
side is probably the easiest method
there are also no real cable tie points
provided although there isn't any lack
of space to hide the cables in the 5
centimeter wide enclosure it would just
be nice to be able to more easily tie
them down to hold them where you want
them cooling capacity is limited to the
radiator mount this really is a case
designed from the bottom up with the
intention of liquid cooling and although
air cooled systems will function
perfectly fine at waists on the
potential the case by leaving the one
side either empty or filled with 2.5
inch or 3.5 inch drives there's a
magnetic air filter clipped to the case
which may or may not be useless
depending on the direction of the
airflow particularly in an air-cooled
configuration and to really make use of
this as a good open air test bench one
of the features we would like to see is
optional mounting for fans right up here
in the front of the case so that they
can blow inward and get some airflow in
there we use fans like that in our open
air benches for example if you want the
ability to easily swap in and out
devices but also the ability to do some
directional airflow for when you're
testing things like back plates or
passive products or things like that
so some kind of functional mounting
bracket up here for 120 millimeter or
140 millimeter space and would be
fantastic for the next iteration so you
can get some more airflow over the
products for people who want to use this
in an open-air bench setup because open
air test benches are really expensive if
you aren't aware the benches we buy for
testing for our day-to-day component
benchmarking and analysis cost about two
hundred and fifty dollars each they're
really good but they're expensive this
competes with those in a lot of ways it
lacks some of the features like the fan
mounting but it's 93 dollars so that
makes a good competitor for folks who
are interested in an open-air bench
setup if you're an enthusiast or an
overclocker or an up-and-coming reviewer
or something like that and you don't
want to invest 250 bucks in something
the biggest concern with the case after
that is stability since half the case is
comprised of non structural beams and an
acrylic or tempered glass sheet with the
rest dedicated to the enclosure
Thermaltake has largely solved for this
by just adding more metal to the chassis
making 2 millimeter thick walls when
accounting for the paint 3 millimeters
thick steel brackets for wall mounting
and wide legs to prevent tipping the
only supporting structure that fails to
perform Foley is the PSU bracket which
holds the Corsair RM 650 up entirely at
buy one side and didn't quite make
contact with the middle this is more
likely because very in power supply
dimensions than thermal takes
manufacturing though it would be nice if
they could do some kind of
implementation that would better fit
everything moving on into the objective
testing you can check our link in the
description below for full testing
methodology click on that you can read
more about how we do the test and also
find Patrick Lathan's opinion on this
case he works with the case the most and
wrote the article that's one
below so you get two dueling opinions
there if you're interested in that kind
of content
running the Thermaltake Corp III through
the CPU bench we see that the open air
configuration performs reasonably well
overall the only reason an open-air set
up wouldn't chart top as we see here is
because of reduced directional airflow
into the components and reduced ability
to push warm air away in the case of T
three the acrylic window blocks some of
the heat from escaping in a fashion that
might occur with a truly open air bench
but not in a way which significantly
hinders air flow or performance with our
standardized case testing bench the Corp
III under a torture workload operates at
around 53 Celsius delta T over ambient
with an idle around three Celsius delta
T we lose some of the directional
airflow and heat exhaustion abilities of
something like the Silverstone R l06
which is a chart topper for us right now
but still perform well in a semi open
air configuration of the p3 the p3
places just outside test variants
margins of the courser t7 ER at 10 50
rpm which tested about one degree warmer
and within variants of the 270 R at 1300
rpm for the p3 the fractal define see
also does reasonably well here
maintaining some level of silence by
nature of being an enclosure but also
being somewhat close in temperature
readings speaking directly to the p3
though there's nothing really to
complain about provided adequate active
cooling solutions or the CPU and GPU
temperatures will remain in check moving
to the GPU temperatures during the same
torture workload as the previous test
the thermal take core p3 runs a 52.5
Celsius delta T over a man GPU value
when the fan is configured to 55% with
the idle temperatures hovering around
4.7 Celsius LT prior to test start this
position is the thermal take Corp III
open-air configuration about equivalent
with the 270 our stock configuration at
10:50 RPM similar to the previous test
and with invariance range of the
BitFenix Shogun at 1260 rpm it's not the
coolest box on the chart it's also not
really a full box be fair but for a semi
open air configuration with a side panel
and no directed airflow from case fans
it's doing pretty damn well the GPU is
that no risk of throttling in this
configuration and a 55 percent fan speed
is representative of the max that most
fan curves are willing to go before
sacrificing frequency instead of noise
moving to our 3d mark firestrike extreme
workload on loop we can now look at a
realistic thermal scenario with gay
my workloads on both the CPU and GPU
simultaneously this is less intensive
than our thermal torture test but still
fairly intensive on some components
while offering a real-world look at how
gaming would perform this is a brand-new
test and doesn't have any comparative
data yet so thermal think is the first
to go through the 3d mark test run our
next case reviews will add to this and
help provide perspective on where they
install the next test was introduced
with our silverstone our l06 test and
we'll slowly build the add more
component we're using GM's custom
blender animation to render on the CPU
here leveraging only the CPU as a worker
the GPU is running at its minimum fan
duty cycle as it is not being loaded at
all
and we have fixed the GPU fan speed to
this cycle so it doesn't fluctuate and
impact results with the CPU worker
running we're seeing the Thermaltake
core p3 semi open configuration operate
a CPU load temperature of around 30 7.3
Salty's delta T over ambient with a GPU
idling at 7 Celsius the silverstone RL
'zir 6 is the only other case on this
charge and it was the coolest case we've
recently tested so it's naturally a high
performer the directed airflow keeps the
CPUs around 34.4 SL t TT load with idle
around 3.6 celsius both cases are
performing well in the sense of overall
temperature being well within any
reasonable operating range but we need
to continue iterating on case reviews
add more data to this charge and to
quoting gns Patrick lengthen for noise
testing because he really sums it up the
best we see that noise levels were low
because of the lack of fans but also
didn't benefit from any insulation
there's a very easy way to judge how
loud a radiator with fans will be when
installed in this case plug it in and
listen to it because that's exactly how
loud it will be we want more of his take
on this case be sure to check his
written article below but you can see
the noise levels here and it's performed
where you'd expect an open-air bench
with no sound or noise damping to
perform and in that regard
noise levels are going to be entirely
dependent on what's in the case now they
always are to some extent but normally
you have things like case pans and
features of the case I would impact your
noise here you don't so the testing for
noise levels really doesn't show you a
whole lot other than what our case or
our test system noise level is when it's
in an open air configuration so you'll
have to buy based on your components in
terms of noise but otherwise looking at
the case overall eliminating half the
on the case and going with just this the
structure and an acrylic window brings
cost down it means that they can get a
93 dollar price point 90 ish and that's
not bad the price of the p3 is
competitive in this regard it is priced
right around where the Corsair 400 see
is the s3 40 elite the fractal define
sea and all manner of other cases that
we've reviewed recently including the be
quiet pure bass 600 none of these cases
are quite like this one though so it's
really a weird market where if this is
what you want it's probably exactly what
you want and that's all there is to it
there's not a whole lot of alternatives
out there other than open-air bench if
you want that or maybe some other small
wall mountable PC but it would like to
be smaller than this one if it's not
what you want there's a whole bunch of
options again 400 cs3 40 elite both good
cases pureed 600 a good case are l06 not
bad so plenty of options out there this
is an enthusiast case it has specific
use cases you probably don't want it
configured like this on a table if you
have pets for example but it would be
just fine wall-mounted so a pretty
unique in that regard
and helps out thermal takes image
certainly after the last year or so
other notes here it's a targeted market
you lose noise insulation and things
like that noise damping more
appropriately because it is an open air
setup and you lose directed cooling but
if you buy decent components it will be
fine we would like to see Thermaltake
expand on this though and maybe consider
the fact that this as an open-air bench
is very appealing because there aren't a
lot of good options out there for under
$200 so that's somewhere they could
expand more an 18 by 18 inch square
though is a bit rough to fit
horizontally but it's a start
so that's all for this one as always you
get a patreon.com slash scammers Nexus
tops out directly the articles below if
you want the full written review thank
you for watching subscribe for more I'll
see you all next time
and more of a standard configuration
without the riser cable other than this
there are options for radiator mounting
