i7 8086 k overclocking livestream this
is a recap of the results the whole
thing was four hours long so
understandably a lot of you probably
don't want to watch it after the fact if
you do wow more power - yeah
so yeah four hours long the reason it
went so long is because we had a really
good concurrent viewer base the entire
time and I really wanted to hit a
specific score and fire strike that was
twenty four thousand points for physics
and we got pretty damn close so I'll
give you the numbers in a minute so
we're just gonna recap the frequencies I
hit this is a 286 k it's especially been
to basically 8700 K same architecture
same core account same everything same
stock frequency even the difference is
it over clocks higher nearly guaranteed
because it is pre-selected by Intel to
be one of the higher clock in 8700 KS
and so we thought it would be fun to try
and do that live and see how far we can
push the thing before that this video is
brought to you by Thermal Grizzlies high
end thermal paste and liquid metal
Thermal Grizzlies cryo knot is an
affordable high quality thermal compound
that doesn't face some of the aging
limitations of other pastes on the
market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted tests by a tube at the link
in the description below so first of all
recapping all the Part C is what we did
was first off deleted the CPU we used a
rocket cooled D letter kit that I had it
works for the 8086 k just fine
technically the one I have for 7700 KS
but it still works then we removed all
of the silicone adhesive the black
adhesive around the outside we removed
all of it scraped it all off and then
put on some liquid metal we put on
thermal grizzly conductor not they were
the advertiser for the stream but we
were going to use their liquid metal
anyway so it worked out very well so
thermal grizzly conducted on something
we've used a lot we have another content
piece that's live already that talks
about our temperature reduction by using
that instead of the stock thermal paste
that
help what's on there so that was a major
help to removing our thermal limits he
really didn't have any thermal limits at
all during the stream the problem was
mostly it seems like the IMC on the CPU
which I'll get to in a moment other
parts in the build we had an asus rog
maximus x or 10 motherboard did pretty
well seem to have issues with the
command rate of one so that was annoying
we end up using 2 most the time so that
was a motherboard quark but otherwise it
was a good board and also used we spent
a lot of time in bios of course we also
used three different kits of memory so
this was part of trying to figure out if
the IMC was the problem or I don't know
or if it was the memory and what we did
was we use the G scale try and Z black
kit that we used for our repeal TT
stream semi-famous stream for us and
that kit we know does 4,000 megahertz
it's a good memory kit
it does 4000 mega Hertz it does I don't
remember CL 16 roughly is 16 16 26 I
think we're the timings on that one on X
299 not I'm not on coffee like he can't
do the same timings we were at like 16
16 28 or 30 30 or something like that
and then we also had a several other
timings tightened I'll list them in the
article below or something like that if
you're curious but ultimately even
though we know the kit does 4,000
megahertz we could not get it past 36 60
something on the 8086 K it was very
unfortunate so it wasn't it wasn't a
memory bin the memory is fine we know
it's good what it started indicating
sort of unfortunately for us was that
the 8086 K that we have probably didn't
have the best IMC in the world the
integrated memory controller and this is
a problem when you talk about memory
frequencies a lot of the other kit we
used was a Corsair forty 600 megahertz
CL nineteen kit forty six hundred
megahertz pretty freakin high so the
thing that you run into with those kids
even if the memory at some point in
testing and quality assurance did 4600
there's no guarantee you'll ever get to
that number cuz you're talking about how
good is the motherboard you're running
and how good is the IMC on the CPU
and you probably want to bin for the
course so you're bidding for the core
for the IMC you're getting good
motherboard and you've already been for
the memory by buying something that's
rated as high so there's no guarantee
it'll ever run at those speeds but we
tried it anyway and even the 4600 kit
with for it lose timings like CL 16
could not do anything over 3600 so it
seems like that's just our limit for our
8086 K pushing SSC to 1.3 and IO to 1.3
didn't really help too much so anyway
what we ended up with our goal was
24,000 points in fire strike physics
only and we got 22,000 745 so I'll be
back I'll be back to get those last
three hundred or so points 250 points
because it was damn close and the only
reason I cut it short at the end was
because we're just getting blue screen
after blue screen trying to get the last
couple hundred points and it was clear
that you know I got a got to kind of
shelve it and let it rest and figure out
what's going on so way back but pretty
damn close final clock on the CPU as
5.35 gigahertz tried for five point
three seven
tried for five point four to get it to
work so we did a one-on-one BC okay we
253 multiplier 1 point 4 or 5 volts
pretty stable we actually can do 5.2
gigahertz with a similar bc lk at i want
to say one point four two volts or even
lower sometimes depending on the that's
with prime mind you with fire strike
it's way less voltage so a vote
frequency curve was very good on the cpu
this has definitely got a good core on
it we were been pretty well for the volt
frequency curve towards the low end once
we hit 5.3 and onward though that curve
got exponentially more difficult to
climb requires exponentially more
voltage for each step after 5.2 on our
cpu and so 5.25 was our limiter today
and we might be able to do more later we
tried perk or individual overclocking to
54 onto of the course even one of the
core and just didn't do it would not
hold kept please screening we had a one
point four or five volt for most of our
test we went up to one point five in
some scenarios we went to one point five
the thermals on the cpu are still pretty
under control
because it's only 30 second test
so it's fine but having a lower
temperature would still have helps
especially power leakage so it might do
a bigger radiator next time and also we
did have to stick a fan on top of the
vrm so that was a concern too once we
start pushing 1.5 volts into the thin we
tried to 102 BC okay we tried 101.5 had
trouble stabilizing ultimately wasn't
with the memory clocks we wanted would
have liked to try 103 with a lower
multiplier and we'll do that in the
future and then we also spent two hours
trying to Tim the RAM so at Coursera we
had a coarser 32 hundred megahertz CL 16
kit that I started with honestly I
thought that was gonna be the worst one
but I guess that kit is pretty decent
for us because I thought the g.skill kit
would destroy it but as noted that
g.skill kit just wouldn't go over 3600
for this memory or for the cpu rather so
the courser 3200 kit we pushed it up to
3600 it was still going strong and that
was with the CL of 15 so really pretty
damn good for that specific kit of
memory because it's it's not meant to be
that good we also did a course at 4,600
kit pushed it to 3600 on CL 1415 area I
think we did 14 pseudo stable at one
point and ultimately again it seems like
our IMC is simply not that good on our
8086 case so that's that's a sad thing
for us but voltage is overall we tried
pushing 1.5 occasionally was not enough
454 X on the multiplier we added an H
well fans of erm when doing this we ran
a system agent at 1.3 IO at 1.3 wouldn't
recommend doing those voltages are
higher than them for any kind of
long-term use but for a benchmark who
cares same for B then we had V damnit
1.85 and some tests and 1.6 and others
now a couple things here V Tim you don't
want to go beyond 1.5 and Rison or Intel
for any kind of long-term use you'll
burn up the memory controller the SOC
and what we're doing is different we're
doing short benchmarks the goal is to
get a high score and then who cares
consequences be damned we're gonna do it
so don't don't just copy our numbers
please because those voltages are pretty
damn aggressive in some instances and
could cause some long-term degradation
but for one night of benchmarking it's
fine so yeah 1.85
demographic we did 1.6 and other tests
the RAM can absolutely take it has no
problems at all at one point eight but
the IMC's another question all current
settings were fully uncapped so current
limits on caps pushed Alcee to level six
left there for the most part because at
level seven tends to overshoot the
voltage rather than undershoot when it
dips and the big takeaway here is
learning more about memory overclocking
so a lot of the stream I spent
interacting with the last hour so
interacting with builds would be a
discord and from actually hardcore
overclocking I was able to get the
memory improved a lot and improve our
scores a lot as a result so it was a
great learning experience for me my big
takeaway is learning more about memory
timings we're working on our secondary
and tertiary timings videos Patrick's
researching those that'll help me a lot
too and that's definitely my weak spot
in overclocking so I loved the stream I
greatly enjoyed interacting with
everyone thank you for being there if
you were there and thank you for
watching the follow up if you were not
and we're going to keep doing these I'm
just bear with me I'm gonna keep working
on my memory overclocking skills so and
not just our clocking but timings tuning
so in the future hopefully that process
will be faster but even then people who
are skilled with it it can still take
hours so we're always going to pre test
some of it just to get a rough idea of
where we can fall and the goal I have
with these at the outset is to basically
say I know I can do 23,000 points I
think I can do 24 but I haven't done it
yet so my goal going into these is
always pick a number that's achievable
and then set a goal just outside of it
so that in the live stream we have some
genuine real effort pushing for it it's
not like it's pre-planned or anything
like that it's I mean you're seeing the
real blue screens as you're watching it
so narrate end result here five point
three five gigahertz on the core
thirty-six hundred megahertz was our cap
for the memory it seemed maybe we can
push more with a looser set of timings
but then you start dropping firestrike
scores so the trade-off just isn't worth
it in our instance I you could go CL 18
or 19 maybe do closer to 4,000 but I
don't know that it would have gained us
anything anyway we got we have a lot
more to try and I'm looking forward to
it so that's our stream we have thermal
power and even noise as an acoustic
