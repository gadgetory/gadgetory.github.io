let me open up chat and all that stuff
and what we're gonna be doing is looking
at this pile of cards in front of me
today so we have a lot of stuff we can
work with for this okay so I think we
are alive yes looks like real life cool
it does start streaming before you click
start streaming in YouTube but only by
like 15 seconds okay all right so yeah
what we're doing today is testing a
bunch of 20/80 tea eyes and what we are
testing is artifacting primarily so
these are from viewers and some of these
I've already tested most of them but you
can go through it again because there's
it's always something new with this and
we keep finding different modes of
crashing and things like that so I want
to wait for a chat to join in a little
bit and tweet out a link and stuff like
that and then we'll start benchmarking
I'll show you the system that we have
set up as well so we are live testing
the r-tx 2888 VI artifact gain all right
cool okay so most you probably are aware
of this issue by now what we are not
doing is is hopefully not showing BS
hoodie is how the bsod issue should be
pretty much solved I think I have maybe
one card on the stack in front of me
that wow that was that's okay but it was
just blue screening and that should be
resolved with the drivers because that
was a very monitor dependent issue yes
we're using the latest Nvidia drivers or
we will be and then the rest of it is
going to be artifacting primarily on the
FE cards but we're gonna look at some of
these other cards as well I have a
gigabyte one down there that I haven't
tested yet so we'll test that live today
and then has 4c a couple questions in
chat already too and I'll start getting
to these soon
so for first super chat was sivaiah less
a $1.99 hi Steve unlimited power yes
unlimited power might be part of the
problem on these we'll find out today
James coil $2 intel is watching you
don't know what that means but probably
accurate under stood zc $5 Steve are the
limited-edition T's fitted or looser
overall hashtag F stream posters they
are they're pretty fitted but they're
very close to our exist our other shirts
are non foil shirts so if you have one
of those they're pretty damn close the
the foil T's are marginally tighter like
they're a little more fitted so you're
kind of borderline maybe bump a size up
or down as appropriate and I'll note
that on store digame razaaq's has done
that we are in the final rounds of these
so I think these will probably be gone
during this stream today because we have
I don't know like 20 left or something
like that last I checked okay so yes we
have a pile of 28 et eyes we have let me
just go through them first I guess so
we've got which one is this this is in
I've labeled them all to for internal
tracking purposes so we know whose is
whose but this is an EVGA 20 atti XC
gaming we have a 20 atti XC ultra and
then we've got a whole bunch of these I
have more that are not on the table here
because we only have so much time today
so this one fe card obviously and we
have an fe in the bench already of a
couple Effie's in the other room we have
another fe e so we're gonna be working
on three of these alive today and then
you can watch the video for other
coverage when we do a recap video later
XC gaming and then a gigabyte card so
the ones we're really interested in are
the FES cuz I've already tested almost
all the partner cards that I got in from
you all and if you do haven't a card
with artifacting issues I guess email us
if you want to send it in on loan but
we'll figure it out dead 2080 TI @
gamers nexus tonight if you really
wanted to to check on it okay so people
are starting to file in
let me go over the testbench if we can
see any of it this is pretty
straightforward so we're not trying to
replicate the blue-screen issues today
we are going for other issues and I
guess I'll turn on my a my power log or
two because we might make use of that I
have a card in a bench next door but I
forgot to bring it over here but it
currently has about six thermocouples on
it so it's a wiry mess but we're
actually not seeing overheating issues
on that so now I've seen vram
overheating issues not seen vrm
overheating issues back side of the PCB
seems fine there are cards that do run
incredibly hot that I haven't put probes
on yet but just field test a pretty hot
that's not valid for anything though the
card I have in the test bench over there
now is actually not overheating it
doesn't have memory thermal issues which
is what people postulated a lot when
this issue first came about so that
doesn't appear to be the issue on that
specific card we'll see if it is on any
of the others not going to test thermals
live today because that involves taking
them apart and putting a bunch of
thermocouples on it so I need to do that
off stream it takes a lot of time but we
are going to just demonstrate the
problem and see if there's like I don't
know if we throttle back on power or
memory frequency will it fix the
artifacting issues so here's the the
first cover testing this is f1 and this
one is just a Nephi card as well then
for the bench we have Maximus 10 hero
so an 8080 6k bench for this one it's
deleted I mean it's 5 gigahertz doesn't
really matter but it's our standard CP
or a CPU for GPU testing and then a
corsair if we look at the power supply
down here of course here a X 1600 I and
that is sufficient I mean the reason I'm
showing it is because we're not going to
have power limitations with a 1600 watt
power supply so any of the issues are
are those of the card almost entirely
and and that's what we're looking at
today so I also have a power monitor on
there then as for before we get started
with some of the testing here the
sponsor for the stream is Thermaltake
their flow 360 cooler so if you won't
pick it up we've got a link in the
description video description down below
this is the thermal take flow rain 360
RGB cooler comes with the arena RGB fans
and they were actually some of the first
to do that approach to LED lighting and
fans and it's an ace attack branded pump
that's then modified for thermal takes
uses so if you're familiar with AC tech
performance you get the same a stack
performance here just with thermal takes
rain fans for some extra extra um okay
so first one we've got some people in
chat now and I think let's just go ahead
and did you know it down the memory each
card has okay let me address this
apparently micron has a supply issue
there's actually no confirmation of that
like no one everyone who says that
doesn't know what they're talking about
there might be issues with the micron
memory but the reason people think that
there are issues is not the correct
reason people think that micron memory
is bad on like all our TX cards because
Nvidia started using Samsung memory
that's not how it works
Nvidia and AMD always mix their memory
suppliers after the first round comes
out for new memory architectures or
designs or whatever GD dr6 is brand new
micron is first to market Samsung's
coming in so it's to alleviate a supply
issue not to alleviate necessarily a
like a little like a defect issue with
the micron chips so there could be an
issue with the micron memory there might
be a bad batch but all of the micron
memory is not bad which is what I'm
seeing hot on line where people are like
all our TX 20 guys that have micron
memory don't work because that's not
true we have I don't know like a dozen
our TX cards for review sample purposes
and not one of them had this artifacting
issue so anecdotal yes but there are
hundreds of reviewers and same thing
there and also I mean I I just I know
from talking to people it's it's supply
so this always happens the cards always
bring on new memory suppliers as they
start pushing same thing with this is
why a lot of the vendors won't specify
their capacitors their thermal pads
their thermal paste stuff like that
because the supply has changed
constantly to keep up with demand so you
open one card
the next you might see different thermal
paste or thermal pads as we saw with our
TX and that's the same thing you're seen
with memory so definitely there could be
a difference in quality between memory
but that's the reason the memory is
changing is not solely because of like
defect issues or something like that so
when is the foil shirt expected the ship
there in production and I think we have
it on the website above the Add to Cart
button there's like an estimate of when
they'll be shipping so that's handled by
distribution but if you go to store
documents access not net click on the
foil shirt you'll see the estimate for
when we were planning to ship it okay so
yeah let's let's just run I don't know
like time spy or something we have a lot
of testing we're doing separately that
won't be on the stream for Diagnostics
but you can use different applications
like different gt2 for example is great
for testing memory if we think there's a
memory issue specifically if it's memory
artifact and it does look like that here
on gt2 and try and validate that your
own firm Ark if you think it's a power
delivery issue and we've been doing that
as well so there's different
applications to stress different parts
of the card I have the monitor scaled so
this is gonna I might have to scale it
back up to 4k we're not looking at
performance or anything today we're just
looking at is it gonna start artifacting
so let me let this launch and then I
might might scale it back to 4k just to
get it to get a full screen because we
get artifacts we want to enjoy them in
their full resolution so like I said we
are working with a number of cards today
and the time at which they fail may be
different the applications that cause
them to fail may be different some might
even be completely fine depending on if
they were sent in on bsod issues or sent
in on on artifacting issues so let's
kill this and get it open fullscreen
okay it's just gonna make it harder for
me to see but it'll be easier for you to
see alright so stress test so we're just
gonna tell it to run fire strike extreme
it might not very extra time spike
extreme might not artifacts we'll see in
a second
if it does not will launch a different
one okay so let me check on chat for a
second so we got I'm not convinced that
this is real Steve I don't know what
what that means like it it happens so I
see it what we don't know is is this a
widespread issue or not like the
artifact in specifically DSR these were
widespread issue artifacting its kind of
nebulous because speaking with partners
they're still seeing RMA rates that are
completely within the norm so you know
what how that how that kind of is
represented as these cards age we don't
know but certainly Nvidia says it's not
a broad issue and the partners seem to
say that they have low RMA rates but
Nvidia is not going to tell us if they
have high RMA s and I don't know the
retailers seem to say that there's our
normal as well which is typically under
4% super chats while this is going till
we it sometimes it takes a couple
minutes artifact sometimes it doesn't at
all depends on which card is in there so
we'll find out soon super chat from Sam
command so $2 thank you for that thanks
for doing this for the community Steve I
think Sam might be sending in one of his
cards as well so we may have one coming
in from you what do I need to check my
notes on this one and see if I already
test this this is card f1 so f1 I saw
issues with artifacting originally and
issues with being unable to install
drivers at all with the previous driver
version so that might be a different
issue than some of the other ones but
let me we'll let it go a little longer
and I'm going to read some more super
chats before we try and stress at
different ways it caused it to crash so
next one is from Draco night Walker
$5.00 great way to spend a Saturday
morning in Washington kiesza swell thank
you for viewing from Australia Axius $5
was the thumbnail with the Lightning a
subtle advert for the mod match ie
anti-static properties nope I think we
were just going for destructive
references $2 message retracted okay
easier $2
Australian can we get some GN themed
pajamas now sorry no current plans
wishbone $5 does the 28th et I suffer
from artifacts from beetle Adventure
Racing where did this this reference to
this game start because I've seen this
one a lot the beetle Adventure Racing
reference do you know where that came
from
is that a Linus thing or is that just
like a general gaming thing let's see
let's see what's going on with the card
so I'm just gonna launch precision and I
just double-check on its frequency while
it's running extreme okay good enough
and we'll just kind of start swapping
cards looking for ones that artifact
we've got a big pile of them and andreas
sheriff $2 Steve it tell Jay to hashtag
pimp my pc isn't that Kyle saying I
think that's Kyle Finn isn't it pimp my
rig I meant to launch that in windowed
mode we got one from Sean Devine $5.00
have you considered doing a more joint
videos with the Canadian ruble my sir
Linus yeah I mean he's not that close to
us so we try to just meet up with him
whenever we're at events at the same
time and it's always fun working with
Linus of course let me launch that in
windowed probably work with mats maybe
CES we might run into each other and in
Las Vegas in January next one Chris in
do 6 $5.00 it's got home just in time to
crack a beer and take a DAB hey Steve
fiddle with my card thanks for doing
this I don't know which one yours is but
it is if you sent it in it's probably on
the table we might have another one it
might be in one of the benches next door
okay so let's check on the just see if
the frequencies doing what it should be
it should be going to like 1900
megahertz so just part of basic
troubleshooting here it's kind of within
reason I guess
okay so not seeing artifacting yet on
this one this is one that had
specifically had issues with installing
drivers and it was the previous version
so that might be a driver related defect
although it was pretty severe
artifacting if it was just a driver
thing whereas some of the others might
be hardware level we'll find out though
let me just boost the power target just
to see what happens if we do a basic
overclock that shouldn't be a problem so
I just did a hundred offset in max power
target now most of these are artifact if
they artifact with the baseline specs so
you shouldn't need to overclock them to
cause it but we're just gonna let it run
like this for a bit and maybe go to a
couple minutes or something see if it
exhibits any issues and I also I need to
figure out which card I was testing
earlier not that one I think
let me check the other room and see
which card I had that for sure was
having issues this one should be pretty
good alright so I'm just grabbing a card
out of a test bench right now you should
still be able to hear me and it's got a
lot of wires hooked up to it so it's
gonna take me a second okay I'm caught
my okay there we go
so here's one that's really under test
right now lots of wires coming out of it
lots of thermocouples logging different
parts of the card to see if there's a
thermal issue so there were no thermal
issues with this one that we've measured
we don't have every component logged of
course but we've got a lot of them
logged and we're not seeing high
thermals or out of spec thermals on
honey so I've got one of the MOSFETs two
memory modules back side PCB where it's
the hottest on the backside anyway and
none of those are showing thermal issues
so but it's just killing benchmarks as
they run so one of the things we're
trying to figure out is is is that
because of a power issue or is it
because the monitor that took it up to
it but we've tested in a couple of
different test benches now and sometimes
the issues are sporadic but for
artifacting they they seem pretty
Universal let's see which one of these
everything's so small at 4k from this
distance so we're gonna do just do
OpenGL stress test that's not what I
wanted but close enough I guess they've
updated this application alright I'm
just gonna run this for a minute as well
stress a different part of the card this
is gonna be power and we should reset to
defaults here to default
okay now overclock so frequency here I
should note is it's gonna be lower so if
you're seeing numbers that you think are
low it's because fur marks specifically
does not enumerate the clock the same
way it's more of a V RMS raster so you
don't boost as high so that's actually
normal that's not a defect that it's at
1600 megahertz and we've got 99% GPU
load I don't like this version of fur
mark FC and
thermals are within reason on the core
so far I typically we let this run for
at least half an hour for trying to do
thermal tests but this one on the card
I'm going to plug in next was failing
within a couple minutes typically I
don't know that we've seen that on the
card that's in there now so we have f1
and there now we're gonna go with E one
next which is one of the other cards and
feeling kind of impatient so I'm not
gonna let this go too long before I plug
in the other one just to start showing
off some of the issues that we're seeing
but doesn't hurt to start with one that
has sporadic people are saying bad
doughnut and now I want doughnuts don't
have death and Homer no all right let me
check
super chats and stuff so Oh actually let
me take a couple store orders too
because we got some of those and so if
you order from the store tonight on
store doc gamers X it's not net we're
down to the last probably 20 or so
actually we got an order in let's see
maybe 19 at this point of the the foil
graph logo shirts this one I'm wearing
now the limited-edition one so we're
planning probably probably going to run
out of this one if you remember the last
one in the middle back there the foil
anniversary teardown logo shirt that one
we had some left over after we we sold
through we had a couple left over that
we held for shipping purposes in case
any got lost and shipping just to make
sure everyone got one this one's been
popular enough we're not gonna do that
this time so I mean they'll be they'll
be gone when they're gone and that's
gonna be it there won't be a second
listing for any period of time so we got
an order from Jonathan from New York
thank you for placing that picked up a
video card components poster and one of
the shirts okay so I'm feeling impatient
I want to show issues let's let's switch
over to a card that typically has been
showing issues but never know it should
probably persist to this bench from the
other one this is so hot but it's not
not outside a spec or anything it's just
too hot to touch
so the backplate on these it seems like
on all of them gets to be about 70
degrees or so Celsius and for
perspective 60 is about where you don't
want to touch it for more than a couple
seconds but that doesn't mean it's
malfunctioning though it just means you
know be careful if you are swapping
cards out a lot and that's also why we
hooked up so many thermocouples to this
one which will go ahead and monitor some
of those while this is running assuming
I can do it without them getting too
crazy tangled so this one's going to
memory it's going to this this
thermocouple
it's going to a memory module where's
slots right there so it's right around
here on the board and then this
thermocouple back here is going to the
back side of the PCB on the one of the
hotspots on the backside of a GD dr6
module and then this one is going to a
MOSFET so it's the hottest MOSFET in the
middle of all of the vrm and actually
that's going to memory next to the
MOSFETs it's the hottest memory die next
to the vrm and then this one is going to
the MOSFET in the middle I think that's
all of them on this car so it's it's a
lot of lot of thermocouples which gets
really annoying to setup and very
expensive very fast okay so this is e1
which like I said does not appear to
have thermal issues but does appear to
have issues with stability and we're
going to have to probably reinstall the
drivers for each car the thermocouples
in my way there we go
okay cool sorry annoyingly gonna have to
probably should reinstall drivers for
each one because it's a different device
different device ID despite being the
same model of device so we're gonna just
reinstall and clean those drivers
pcie and okay this one should be kind of
fun because we can look at the thermal
data while it's going go okay no
thermocouples near the fans okay those
are all on we're booting and those are
away from the fans so we should be good
to go on this one
if little boot there we go it's a good
start so yeah this one after a driver
install it's been crashing and uh I
don't know it's so sporadic so it
crashed twice and fire strike extreme
and then after that it survives fire
strike extreme but it kept crashing in
fur mark but different version of fur
mark than I have on here so we'll see
how much that matters and I need a quick
DD you yeah okay
after we do to you we're gonna install
the driver part of this is also testing
the new driver versus the old but I was
using this one on the new driver today
when I was having those issues okay
super chats while this is clean on
Ensign hidden shades five dollars
Canadian thank you there bear mentioned
that the twenty eight ETI cards are
running at less than five percent RMS
currently I believe his number was
actually around two percent so and I
think your message got cut out are the
loud few making and it ends there
yes that's about what we're here we're
hearing less than that actually
so typically numbers for basically for
like all of the cards is under four
percent for our mas and then the some
manufacturers have told us there are
point one percent for our TX and some
are even lower than that you have to
remember a few things here there's some
sample bias because manufacturers like
ace use gigabyte all the board partners
those people they are selling different
cards technically so it's the same
reference PCB same GPU same memory even
but there could be something else going
on with batch like if Nvidia got the
first batch of everything maybe that one
had defects or something to that extent
but then you have to ask why isn't that
happening with the press samples so yeah
it's definitely this issue is not quite
as widespread I don't think as you might
believe it's not like literally every
twenty eighty or twenty atti is doing
this artifact in the the BSOD has got
mixed in there with the artifacting
which made it look a whole lot worse
than it was but most of those related to
multi-monitor to gsync high refresh
anything to do with monitors so bsod is
are being solved through drivers whereas
the artefact and we don't really speak
in with various people in the industry
don't really have a known solution for
those yet
so that's what we're dealing with in
terms of unpredictable behavior but to
answer your your comments it is a low
RMA overall from what partners have told
us for what you can trust of that number
and it sounds like it's more affecting
Effie and we don't have any numbers from
Nvidia for Effie RMA is it's really
riveting installation of the driver
version for 16.8 1 ok so and then we've
already killed the drivers and I just
need to do an install and then we can
start messing around with this one
currently if you're curious the
temperatures are where's this going this
one is going to the middle memory module
36 degrees on one of the GDD are six
modules where's this one going MOSFET I
think 38 degrees which is completely
reasonable and then ambient is about 23
and our last component backside are
actually two more components back side
PCB 36 degrees that's opposite the one
of the hotter memory modules it's not
doing anything of course right now okay
so that's installing it's got a comment
from Mitch Jeffrey two dollars
Australian hi from Australia the left
Hardware unboxed apparently he's staked
claim of it zeg five dollars are you
going to test the RMA tracing
performance
just kidding love the content Jian crew
good to see you is EDG thanks for
sending in the five bucks and we'll test
our m8 racing performance I guess when
RMA tracing host where a day 54 no r-tx
but that's partly contingent on the
Windows 10 patch that's supposed to come
out to enable a lot of the r-tx features
because Nvidia and Microsoft are linked
into each other
Norwegian 55 from veggie I have an i5
4690k on a gtx 1060 i get 2 to 5 second
lawn lag spikes a lot
what can the problem be without knowing
more about your configuration that's I
don't know check check thermals on the
CPU and the GPU you could check if
you're hitting any kind of like thermal
threshold t.j.maxx or something like
that without knowing it that would cause
that you could be experiencing issues
with I don't know didi you and Driver
reinstalled probably worthwhile as well
that can happen for a lot of reasons
graphics quality settings being one of
them okay so I don't know what version
of combustor I have on here but where
you gonna try and use it and then I'll
probably change the resolution if I
can't see it well enough all right so
let's do a test with fur mark donut
OpenGL J run stress test so what we're
gonna do is look at the thermocouple
readouts I have here for power for total
system power just for reference total
system is that 370 which is actually 30
watts lower than than it was with the
other version of fur mark so I have to
grab that and then the component
temperatures are heating up so we're in
the 40s and 50s I'll update you as soon
as they get a bit higher and GP loads at
99% so it is working properly GP power
is at about ninety eight ninety nine
hundred percent so we're good there as
well so everything's doing what it what
it should be so far just in terms of
numbers and running properly I need to
see if I can grab the proper version of
fur mark as well for mark
so this is primarily a power virus
workload it's gonna stress the power
components more than anything which is
what we're most interested in right now
and we have other tests for memory if we
need to go that route so fur mark let's
download this just to have it in case we
need that as well oh there's some
artifact there you go so we got some
artifacts so now you can you can see
what it looks like Hetland the very
least so this is I can you see that okay
on the camera this is what the artifact
in looks like it's it's like little X DS
we kind of realized the oh hey and we're
not sure if there's a pattern to these
but if you're wondering is this a
thorough I mean it could be but for all
the parts we've probed here it really
does not there's not an indication that
it's a thermal problem so we hit 60
degrees max on the vrm and 60 degrees on
one of the memory modules just looking
at my thermocouple readers here I don't
want to move them because I'm worried
it'll suck one of the cables into the
fan and then power max what was our
maximum power to be spike was 445 watts
total system power draw which is
reasonable we've seen that for
known-good cards as well so anyway
there's your there's your artifact and
it crashed too to add to that so that
was combustor let's see if we can get
that to happen one more time in combust
in a fur mark before I move on to
something like you know realistic like
3d mark run this one run stress test I
really don't like this version of fur
mark but it seems to be working so I'll
just let it keep going everyone's
posting XD's and in chat instead of F's
so we got our first artifact in for the
night let me just post a tweet first
artifact in for the night on the live
stream watch here and now what we're
gonna look for is if we can reproduce it
on this card and if we can reproduce it
on other cards and then what
applications
cause that issue and also if we drop the
power and memory does it survive so this
isn't really a memory
Steve could it say okay it could I don't
know what I don't know if it's supposed
to say anything might be an old
character might be a debug code but uh
so we're at 65 degrees right now on what
is this component let me see where does
this thermocouple going this one is the
MOSFET sixty looks like artifact yep we
hit about 65 on the MOSFET before
artifacting and about sixty on the
memory that's the topside measurement so
the die inside of the module will
measure higher than what we can measure
outside of it but 60 is really pretty
low even if there's a 10 degree Delta
that's still within spec which is about
95 C and just for reference I've run
cards without any like only a CLC on the
GPU no cooling on the memory no cooling
on the VRM and I've had memory on 1080
28 et eyes excuse me up to 105 degrees
Celsius the external temperature case
temperature without any crashing it's
not a not like in mass movements very
strange right now probably needs to be
restarted after the artifacting so we've
run it pretty damn hot on known good
cards you shouldn't do that but
traverses of troubleshooting it did not
appear to be just a strict thermal issue
okay so I'm just trying to launch fire
strike and it does not appear to be
happy with that decision I think we're
gonna have to reboot that's okay we
can't give a start menu to open up
that's that's good
unfortunately oh now it's freezing okay
really unhappy after that come on
Shirley really the whole system is very
unhappy with the artifact and that just
happened you get a couple more questions
here
a name that I can't read it's in a
different language but it from
looks like your avatar is a penguin and
it says buy towels or vitals are you
b203 am just went through all the fun of
artifact scene r93 haiti luckily it was
a software issue i know you're paying
r-tx guys may the force be with you well
if you sent one of your cards and then
you've got brethren and chat who are
familiar with your pain okay this is
like this is really annoying like you
see how much I'm moving the mouse and
it's not moving off the screen so we're
frozen clearly and I was saying just
before the stream it's kind of weird
because typically we don't want this to
happen
during a stream because overclocking
streams are normally what we do but for
this one that's basically what you're
watching for okay so kevin schafer $10
gamer that loves overclocking have each
of the past four gems of maximus formula
boards after watching the breakdown of
the 11 hero what would you suggest is
best seen at 390 motherboard for
overclocking
and gaming yeah I mean the Maximus 11
hero it was not it was not super
impressive it's been surprisingly okay
but for the money it's really not worth
it I think it's like 300 bucks or
something builds or adjusted a breakdown
of the gigabyte one of the high-end
gigabyte boards on his channel and that
one looks pretty good
it's the gaming 7 or the gaming 9
equivalent they've rebranded their
entire lineup but that one looks good
and we have one in as well the extreme
we just got in to work with and I
haven't done anything with it yet so
that board looks pretty good right now
as rock tight cheese okay it's it's a
little lackluster it's average I guess
max with 11 heroes not great
haven't worked with the high-end Maximus
11 Series boards yet and then the EVGA
dark is also interesting to me but we
haven't tested that yet either so the
gigabytes the only the gigabyte extreme
board is the only high-end one that I've
actually got here so far other than the
Maximus 11 and build Zoids worked with
that one so we're getting some
flickering on the screen
and that's running let's see how long it
runs the other one ran for a couple
minutes let's just check on these so 40
degrees for the backside 42 ggr 648 for
the other module 48 for the vrm so we're
not in terrible shape for thermals right
now okay so we got another chat from
five dollars from Henry due for hanging
around if you have any questions with my
card yes thank you for sending yours in
yours is definitely in this pile
I used C I used the DP by itself and not
in line with the others super happy to
see how this ends up yes we are we have
I mean I'm interested to see how it ends
as well because the artifacting issues
definitely exist we also know that they
aren't supposed to be super widespread
but they are pretty bad when they happen
so we're curious to see what's causing
it 61 degrees is the highest temperature
on my thermocouples right now and that
is for the vrm which is completely
within spec spec is probably 125 okay so
we got five dollars tech deals hey there
if all else fails try turning it off and
back on again I'm pretty sure it'll do
that itself when it fails so we're
covered on that troubleshooting
technique the card seems to be pretty
good at oh wow that's spectacular that
was a good one I hope it looked like it
was on screen enough let me let me catch
up with I'm just checking the check the
stream playback now to see when you all
see the really colorful artifact we just
saw okay so what driver are using we're
using the newest one this also happens
on the previous two drivers and it looks
like we're still catching up I'm just
watching the stream back to see what
chat says when that artifact pops up I
know I should screenshot it too because
that was a different one that I've seen
yeah yeah so there's there's what we've
been dealing with but the answer the
driver question it's the newest driver
and also happened with the version
before this one the driver did fix blue
screen issues so to Nvidia's credit that
is largely resolved I think there's
still some blue screens from what those
of you email me emailing me have said
but the the main multi display issues
have been partly or largely resolved got
it
just getting a screenshot of Thea the
art of the great artifact
okay let's tweet that one out it's
that's up top
beautiful okay and I'm gonna link to the
live stream alright so there's a good
artifact for ya what did chat say about
this that artifact was something r-tx on
someone says trippin rainbow tracing
what the f f press f4 fireworks that's
ray tracing
neide I don't think that's supposed to
be ray tracing lots lots of apps though
alright so yeah there's there's your
example someone said she's done ski
referencing kingpin perfect
is there any info from Nvidia on what is
causing this no we do not have anything
at present and some people are saying
they're getting blue screens
occasionally but not artifacting yeah so
it looks a lot like memory artifacting
which is why some of the theories have
pointed that direction
why don't you now same card we're just
gonna launch that again except with some
kind of monitoring applications in the
background so we can take a look at if
the core clock is behaving as expected I
need to change this resolution so I can
see it what I'm working with so oh yeah
we're gonna run frequency monitoring
applications and we can also I haven't
actually done this yet on this card we
can try down clock in the memory and
stuff like that and see if it if the
crashing subsides because I know that's
been that's been something a lot of
people have done
to resolve some of their issues although
it's not really a good resolution it's
more of a workaround all right time spy
extreme yes go okay and our temperatures
are completely within reason once again
so does not appear to be thermals on
this card but of course could be
something I don't have probes
okay so we have tayo katsu ninja two
dollars-three dislikes question mark I
guess I don't know I guess they're
people who are who are sad about the
artifact in wishbone $2.00 Xbox is
having a special event tomorrow Mexico
City I was not aware of that I'll look
into it and see what it is we don't
really do too much with Xbox but it is
hardware and the games often are
interesting to test anyway rotten man
five at Euro there's a rumor about the
issue being the GPU chip itself too big
tolerances may lead to a chip being too
high and ending up crushed by the colors
yes so I am also suspicious of the
silicon because that's got memory
controllers in it Wow clocks not great
that's got memory controllers in it and
those could also be faulty I think the
big die has a total of 12 memory
controllers they're 11 for for the 28
ETI so those could be defective it could
be view it could be memory modules
there'd be something completely
unrelated but I would suspect things
relating to memory in the die or the
memory itself as the the primary suspect
just based on what we're seeing so
clocks are bit low but but not crazy
like that 13 50 megahertz card we saw
thermals are within reason more or less
71 degrees so that's okay so let's let's
give this a chance to fail and I'm gonna
keep an eye on the thermocouples this
time hopefully while it fails which
means it's gonna be hard for me to read
chat while doing this so okay Andrew I
guess try and get my attention if it
flashes so I can check the thermals
okay so we got $5.00 can you t pose for
10 seconds please you keep trying and
and I respect your persistence but I'm
not sure for what reason you need 80
powers and the 3d scan me or something
just got a FedEx notification that they
are picking up another one of these
artifact in 2080 t is so we've got more
coming in I don't know how long this one
took it up to blow up last time but
we're at 68 on I should they believe 68
on whatever this is this is the VR and
the MOSFET 68 degrees completely within
reason memory 63 memory number 260 and
then backside of the GPU backside of the
memory module how does memory module 64
Celsius completely within reason Celsius
23 Celsius 23 ambient 23 Celsius there
you go ambient 22 degrees so I will let
it go let it let it flicker and freak
out again did that a second ago
hopefully this time we can kind of catch
some of the behavior I can look back at
the stream at it later
people saying too many rays and r-tx on
and festive artifacts yes it was all all
a big Christmas gifts by Nvidia by 30 X
20 atti and you get green and red
flickering k3 k4 $2 32 cents very
specific what's your favorite
motherboard I don't really have a
favorite motherboard I enjoy working
with the X 299 dark a lot for
overclocking I find it very easy to work
with and it's probably not great for us
as we've been learning tonight might not
be great for stock usage because it is a
bit harder to get everything running
stock but I do enjoy it for overclocking
usage because it's it's easy to work
with also it's got four dims
so that four dimm slots so makes a bit
easier to overclock memory but you do
lose half of your total capacity
potential if you wanted to use it as an
actual workstation motherboard so I
think it for different reasons than you
might in a production machine and then
the maximum is 10 over here for the 8086
K that we're using has been pretty
reliable for for our GPU benchmark so
that's also been decent to work with ok
it's not a not freaking out at this time
so far I think it took a couple minutes
last time so we'll let it keep going for
a little bit also it's full screen last
time I wonder if that might have
something to do with it
oh there it is thank you 70 degrees on
the VRM
68 backside 68 GP or memory and 60
memory so even if they're plus 10 all
those are within spec then we got a
freeze not a not a an artefact this time
oh did it so it artifact it for a couple
frames Andrew says he cut out an
artifact right there and okay
yep so this is actually this is our TX
on if you've been wondering what it
looks like it's actually this is a
review status only right now only
reviewers have this mode so this is ray
tracing if you close your eyes and think
really hard you might you might see it
you might live some of your life with
ray tracing and when your life flashes
before your eyes you can say that you've
seen it so there you go there's an
example of the problem again why is the
RGB lighting on the efi card is disabled
by nvidia because nvidia demands
everything be green it did i talked
about that when we reviewed it it's not
green
therefore it's bad and that's all there
is to it they have an RGB LED in there
they have an RGB controller they have
RGB cabling but there's no RGB there's
just G and that's because that's the
company color I guess you see some cards
ship out of the factory with red which
is kind of amusing I don't know if we we
can try this again
so it seems to take about maybe three to
five minutes to really mess up on this
particular model this card well it's
just
let's drop the memory by like 100
megahertz and I don't know what kind of
memory straps or Delta clocks we have
for that because I only go up and
frequency not down but we can give it a
shot and let's run it fullscreen it
seems like I don't know if there's any
correlation there causation but it
seemed to happen a bit more readily
fullscreen so let's go ahead and run
that that I do - won't know I did plus
100 that's the opposite of what I want I
want - 100 not used to go in that
direction for memory ok theoretically it
is minus 100 so let's see if that has if
that survives for longer than maybe 5
minutes will give it I'm not gonna sit
here and let it run all night stability
testing but we can at least see if
there's any any ad hoc result there's a
couple super chats and store orders
things like that so for oh yes right
I've rescaled the monitor okay let me
let me go back up to 4k here
so like I was saying earlier if you go
to store documents access net you can
pick up things like our mod mats if you
want to get one before the holidays you
should place an order now because this
next trip we sell out of them pretty
quickly the rounds we order these and
rounds and this next round will be here
in the first half of December so you've
got some time but if you if you wait on
it they might go out of stock again
because we can only order so many at a
time and this is going to be the last
round we do and get in before end of
year so if you want one of the mod mats
soon you should place an order for this
round you get a store that game as exits
dotnet for that and now that we're at 4k
let's run this again with a -100 memory
under clock and then also just to note
the foil shirt is on the store so the
graph logo foil shirt squad foil it's
got for foil colors on it and it's the
one I'm wearing tonight
so that shirt is up for a little bit
longer store gamers Nexus dotnet if you
wanna pick that up and then once this
one's gone
it'll probably be gone because it was
pretty popular so we do not expect to
have any leftovers on this one okay
well let's see we're running - 100
megahertz now so we're probably not
gonna see artifacting as soon if at all
assuming the posts online are accurate
in any way
let's bring the camera zoom out a bit
and I'll take some super chats - let me
just keep that in the corner of the shot
or something let me know if you see it
freak out or something okay so we got a
question from Draco night Walker $5
Australian what if it's heat in a case
that's killing these cards well I mean
we're seeing the same issues everyone
else is seeing an open air test bench
and thermals don't seem to be an issue
and I don't have any direct airflow on
the card when I'm testing these so I
mean the Delta is like 10 degrees if you
put it in a case and that's why I've
been saying even with the 10 degree
increase we're still within spec on this
specific card I don't know if that's
true for all of them I could be Heat
that could be thermals but not on this
one it doesn't seem like got one from
Abe risks see bricks see one 99 review
of the MSI Seahawk ekx 28 ET I ever no
current plans we've worked with the
Seahawks in the past the CLC models with
the Corsair MSI combination and those
have always been interesting so we'll
probably try and look at one of those I
don't have any plans to look at the ek
model right now Jose pina $10 I got a
free 2080 strix wow that's a very large
amount of free I want 4k gaming should I
sell this one at paya 20 atti or buy
another 20 80 and go SSL I wouldn't
recommend SLI we've tested it we have
video on the channel if you want to see
how a cell I did with multiple 2080
TI's I don't know if we did multiple 20
eighties but I mean it's it's the same
idea we're in some games there's zero
scallion some games it's 30 40 % so you
feel kind of bad about your purchase at
that point some of them at scale is
incredibly well like snipe really for
but I wouldn't recommend us lie so 2084
4k gaming is completely doable and so is
the 1080 TI by the way it just kind of
depends on your graphic settings on the
type of game you're playing but you
still definitely do 4k gaming with the
2080 trying to save you some money here
the 2080 eye is gonna be a bit better
yeah maybe 30% faster so but I don't
know is the I don't know if that's
really worth another couple hundred
dollars
JW Dickason $10 Steve antium I've sent a
few Twitter messages in hopes of getting
a beanie made because that lasts at
least half of the year I can wear it so
yeah we actually I came up with a
mock-up design for those and we haven't
started working on making them yet but
we do have a design that I like and we
just need to figure out how to finalize
it and who's gonna make it so we've
heard you I replied to you one of your
messages or at least someone who wanted
a beanie and we definitely heard the the
request hidden shades $5.00 I'm sure
it's the very loud for you kind of like
the coverage hey this is this mess you
don't need to make your message
political when you're talking about
video card failures so making the issue
up here much worse than it is here's the
thing issues very bad for the people who
have it so for them it is a big deal
because they spent $1,200 and a video
card doesn't work so as far as does it
affect the entire market of course the
answer is no and the RMA rate is
reportedly pretty low from what the
retailers and manufacturers have said
but it doesn't mean the issue doesn't
exist and it doesn't mean the people who
are affected will you know just roll
over about it so we haven't had
artifacting yet with the 100 megahertz
memory down clock takes couple minutes
typically so we're gonna give it a
little longer and see maybe at the 8 9
10 minute mark something like that it is
hotter now though so it's been running
longer than previously
which means our sustained temperatures
are a bit higher we're at 72 degrees on
the vrm let me see if I can rotate this
safely
okay it don't go into the fan all right
it is rotated okay so which ones which
here top number is going to this one and
this one is going to the vrm okay big
numbers the vrm r at 68 69 and the
little number in the bottom left 72
degrees is the second one and that's
going to the lowest memory module so
this is what I've learned on these cards
is that the memory module is closer to
the PCIe slot seems to be the hottest
that's not Sony to you but even if
you're in a case you're in the eighties
at that point maybe plus 10 see if it's
a hot case and I mean after that but
you're still within spec but this is 100
megahertz down clock it's just that it's
been typically failing before it gets
this hot which to me might indicate a
power delivery issue as well so it could
be memory stability it could be power
delivery not really clear on that but it
is not artifacting right now so we'll
let it run a couple more minutes I'll
take some more Super chats and then
we'll we'll try and bring the memory
clock back up and see if it artifacts
yet again okay so take some super chats
and then we can just leave that in the
corner of the video so you got one from
butthurt Beluga that's it's an
interesting name you have there that
face when watching GN at work also hi
Steve hi don't get in trouble over
watching our stream the hunters $5.00
there is an Nvidia forum thread calling
out that the first batch of gdg are six
memory was micron versus RMA's that
works which came with a second batch
from Samsung so hard R and phone I don't
need hard you can open the cards and see
it to address this again the memory
supply normally comes from multiple
vendors Nvidia added another vendor so
this isn't it's like correlation is not
equal to causation here they've added
another supplier we have a dozen r-tx
cards that are micron they don't have
issue
lots of people have micron memory RTX
cards don't have issues so micron chips
could have a problem but NVIDIA hasn't
just cut the faucet for micron they're
still using micron g gde are six
it's just that samsung has been added
because their memory came online so all
that really does has increased the
supply available to make more r-tx video
cards and that's what they're doing here
AMD did similar with HBM nvidia has done
the same for gddr5 in the past so
correlation is not equal to causation is
what I would say to that one but it is
possible that there could be an issue
with some of the micron memory
especially from the first batch we just
don't know Kevin why is $5 thanks for
the great content thank you for watching
Brian show back $5 fellow iymp question
mark did you ever see john's killer CS
pcs do the first live stream outdoor
overclock tomorrow with the 31 degree
Fahrenheit temperatures tomorrow I am
NOT I don't think I know who that is
sounds like they have a lives from going
on though okay
so I mean yeah it hasn't crashed or
anything it has an artifact at this time
thermals are about 70 on the backside 73
for one of the memory modules 74 the VRM
and we really have to let this run about
30 minutes to let it reach steady state
but it's gonna be pretty close at this
point we're not gonna hit a runaway
thermal scenario right now so I would
say it's plausible that and I'll need to
do more testing an off stream for this
but it's possible that down clock in the
memory has helped here now one thing
I've heard from those would be like
commands oh and chat who are sending in
cards is that you've had to continually
down clock memory into oblivion because
over time it seems to it seems that the
artifacting follows you so I'm not gonna
be able to test that on stream of course
but for power consumption they crash
just crash right when I was about to end
the test this is gonna EV for that crash
I guess power consumption is was not
crazy it was under 400 watts for total
system
which the total system is drying a lot
so well right when I was saying it might
make it it made it farther made it
further in the task for sure that
doesn't mean anything it could have been
a one-off incident but it appears that
this is still unstable so not a perfect
solution effing chat for that one I
guess so it's a VRAM issue I mean it
could be a vrm issue but again we can't
really jump to conclusions like that it
could be a VRAM power delivery for two
for all I know it could be that the
memory is running too fast for what it
was built for or something all right
current clamp we could but I've got I'm
using a pretty high-end monitor for
total system power right now so we've
got a feed going in and out of it I
didn't want to use a current clamp
because I know I'm gonna be swapping
cards so anyway this one clearly is is
defective how this is a one you want in
our batch will mark that as definitely
defective and I'll do further testing on
it what we should do is swap cards now
and see if anything happens with let me
see what the user reported for the
gigabyte card because I have not tested
that one yet gigabyte artifact Sina and
down clocking helps according to the
user who bought the gigabyte card we
have here so let's try that one next is
that would be the first non efi card
i've seen with artifacting and that
would be an important data point the
rest are all efi that i've worked with
that's so so high yes you know it's over
60 degrees if you can't touch it for
more than like three seconds that's
that's how you read the temperatures
okay so we've got our thermocouples here
these are going away with the card I'm
not going to transplant them right now
and we're gonna switch to gigabyte it
next where is it here's our pile of
cards or at least some of them anyway
we have couple more out there
do a driver clean and reinstall and
it'll be ready to run this one I'll take
some super chats while going through
this okay display all right there we go
so that's booting up okay so we got
Brian Shevek got you angel flew to New
Zealand five dollars thank you
thanks to those that pre-ordered against
the advice of GN and did the beta test
now we can buy the revised ones have you
visited New Zealand Steve yeah
pre-ordering is definitely a beta test
we generally for things like a $1,200
video card generally recommend not doing
it but I have not visited New Zealand
I've been the closest I've been which is
still quite far as Taipei and I did at
one year I looked to see how long is the
flight from Taipei to New Zealand
because I was like oh well it's I mean
they're both on the other side of the
world and turns out it's really long so
I have not been but I do want to Cairo
for some mountain biking Axios $2 thank
you the 0 and X sounded like a hex
prefix in C debug question mark yeah I
don't know it might be it could be if
it's like a 0 X for those artifacts it
looks like an XD sometimes that is a
good point though it could be a debug
and might mean something a lookup table
or something for the person who built it
okay so I'm doing is cleaning and
reinstalling drivers just for safety
hearing it's wise to do different device
IDs despite being the same model should
always install clean drivers and we
install them for every card swap even if
it's the same model card next one
Norwegian 50 from newbie this
artifacting is kind of common in the
mining community on 10 VT is at eleven
thousand nine ninety-two to eleven
thousand 999 effective ma'am o'clock low
temperatures 60 C well I mean it's I
don't know I don't know anything about
that kind of workload I guess it's
memory intensive but the question I
would have is is that happening on the
twenty series I guess that's what I
would want to know clean and restart
okay
so vo sa 199 I own the 11 Hero 5.2 all
of it
erm gate fake news it's pretty objective
the quality of the VR I'm on it I ran
the if we're talking clocks
I ran the 11 hero at 5.4 briefly on the
9900 K on 5.3 all so yes it does sustain
the clocks pretty well this the the
problem with it is more the pricing and
the marketing because it was marketed as
an eight phase-- which it is not and the
price is very high but the board itself
seems we pretty okay it's just that at
the price we wouldn't necessarily
recommend it it's it's a bit of a bit of
a hike for what you're getting vrm wise
all right so that's rebooting do driver
install there got a store order so if
you pick something up on the store
tonight as always with our streams I'll
try and chat you out no guarantees but
I'll definitely try to shout out the
things you buy where you're from stuff
like that first name so we got one from
Sam who actually sent us one of these
video Chris Sam you know I am sending
you something for free because he loaned
us a card right you don't have to buy
things but we appreciate it so Sam
purchased one of the limited
and oil graph logo shirts like this one
here the cotton shirt so this is a
completely custom made sure we we
designed it ourselves it's got our
fitment it has our foil request we had
to get a different supplier for that and
really well fitted shirt so I'm pretty
happy with the the cotton is super
comfortable for the material we chose so
you can pick that up on the store until
it runs out and then it's gone forever
all right install driver so thank you
Sam for picking one of those up much
appreciated and I don't know let me see
I don't have your card yet I do see that
you emailed me earlier so I'll check
that out to see see if you're sending
your card in as well so we got John from
the US Connecticut John picked up the
anniversary edition mug thank you for
picking that up the anniversary mug has
been a pretty pretty steady one for
popularity so that oh it's a it's a lazy
susan Andrew I found something we can
use for your product b-roll shots so
rich pretty well actually
so yeah anniversary 15-ounce ceramic mug
on the store if you wanna pick that up
on Stuart I gave his ex tonight and I'll
try and shout you out from picking it up
there in the stream thank you John for
your order we appreciate it
the purchase has always helped us with
doing live streams because there are a
lot of extra work that we don't
typically do because I still have to
upload videos for the day in addition to
live streaming in addition to filmy but
yes so it absolutely helps to buy stuff
on the store when we're streaming to
help us keep going alright so we're
gonna do another install driver install
and this one's a gigabyte card I haven't
tested this one I haven't confirmed if
it artifacts but the user says it does
and in their system they were able to
improve the artifacting whereas my g1 as
this one they were able to improve the
artifacting by down clock in the memory
and I believe by offsetting the power I
don't know if one of the users offset
their power negative as well in that
health which is a workaround not effects
but interesting to know
okay so inside iris let me check on a
chat now it's not even super chat just
what someone says he found it used for
the bricked twenty atti yes that is that
is what we definitely did that's an
expensive coffee cup heater yes
$1,200 $1,200 heater for your coffee cup
runs up to about 70 degrees Celsius not
available on our store
we're not reselling these that's why we
wanted off them all on loan from you all
so you can turn them into heaters winter
is coming after all okay
feels like the r-tx series for now is
like a hardware loot box no softer to
test no real temperature is due to not
fully used and now randomly breaks the
temperature things interesting because
once RDX is implemented I am curious to
see what is the power and thermal impact
from we're gonna disable g-sync just in
case that's let's say cause I can't see
anything on this resolution
so yeah I'm curious to see with the RT
cords in use how will that impact power
and thermals against the standard card
as it is tested today okay
drivers installed you're gonna restart
one more time just make sure they stick
at least it works as a coaster how will
the foil hold with washes so we've got
notes we also ship it with a card with
notes on how it holds as it washes so
we've got that one the previous foil
shirt came out a couple months ago sold
out really fast and it was highly
popular hence making the new one so that
one I've got several of them that I've
worn I don't know there's one I've
probably worn like 30 times it's holding
up just fine so what we do is we
recommend low spin cold wash hand wash
is best if you feel like it I definitely
recommend hand washing but if you want
to throw it into just a laundry bag and
run it cold at low spin and then ideally
hang to dry it's the heat that hurts
foil so if you hang the dry it's fine if
you have to use a dryer
low tombola low heat is the best way to
do it but definitely by hand is it's the
best if you don't feel like it we
understand there are notes on the store
on how to best take care of the the foil
and this one is interesting because it's
got the it's like way bigger sections of
foil instead of the smaller ones of the
anniv design shirt so it holds up holds
up even better to wash and dry and just
make sure you do follow the instructions
as closely as you can pretty easy though
and that's generally you should flip
inside out for any shirt with a design
on it anyway foil or not that's those
are just the best instructions for
taking care of shirts with designs on
them
ok so we're going to start with let's
start with fur mark just keep the same
order as we did last time for the card
that was failing a second ago and I just
said to the furry donut test and we're
just gonna keep an eye on this so we've
got the gigabyte card in there now and I
have not tested this one as I said so I
don't know when or if it will artifact
for us so this will allow you to see if
he the genuine spurious behavior of the
r-tx series in that some of them seem
the artifact and some seem to just have
really unpredictable behavior so we're
gonna let that go for a little bit the
last time it took maybe two or three
minutes something like that to blow up
that was a different card though just
for note Christopher
Wyatt's would you a limited edition foil
shirt thank you very much for purchasing
one of those I need to go back to super
chats to super chats so we're gonna
where I keep an eye on that get one from
Doctor Who 8 6 7-5 3 or 9 I remembered
it this time $2 GN teddy bear and GN
pajamas when why why is that so popular
PS great work thank you no current plans
d TR CS $2 RT x DX
on and then blank off and I think that
was in response for the X DS we saw with
the artifact teen name I can't read as
it is typed in another language $4.99
the coil wines of 2080 tion fur mark
it's crazy there's a bit of coil wine on
some of these cards but I don't hear any
on this one right now but I haven't
heard anything completely insane yet
I've also not used them for prolonged
periods at times other than when when
doing thermal testing so kind of limited
limited endurance testing of these cards
Axios had one where'd it go
xes get a stack trace when you crash
that it's software I can work with you
on that later perhaps James's case $100
Wow thank you James
keep up the great work we will
definitely keep testing
David Joshy $5.00 have the EVGA cards
exhibited artefacts - actually I have -
EVGA cards I've worked on one of them
had a modem failure we're not going to
talk about yet because we need to
validate a few things but one had a
unique mode of failure we haven't seen
anywhere else and one of them and EVGA
is taking care of the customer with that
card and the other one was was it oh
there were three actually one was locked
to 1350 megahertz and we did a video on
that and then one was BSO DS BS hoodies
are solved I think that might be yours
actually
BSO DS were solved by by the driver for
the most part and then 1350 we might
have a solution for that one now I've
been talking with EVGA so we might have
a solution on that one and the other one
that the third mode of failure that
we're not talking about yet there is no
solution forever but we'll talk about
that perhaps later after it's been
diagnosed further so no the answer is no
no artifacting yet on the EGA cards the
clock froze freeze was was the worst one
we've shown thus far and that's not
artifact it's a different different
issue
okay $5 it's a lazy meme now what you do
is appreciated by the community thanks
for the information and content you
provide us all thanks thanks for the
interest it looks like we froze thank
you Andrew
so what was our maximum power for this
one for 45 watt total system power which
is about where they tend to sit so
that's actually not unreasonable
application crash and it's trying to
recover mouse is frozen now so that's a
gigabyte card black screens just killing
the application in the background
probably and see if it recovers I'm not
gonna I'm gonna leave it alone see if it
comes back on its own so that is the
wind force this is a reference PCB as
well this is basically for all intents
and purposes all of these cars are
Nvidia cards these cards PGA s reference
PCBs and video GPU obviously Nvidia
cells in the memory its micron reference
PCB obviously reference PCB the gigabyte
card in there now that just crash
reference PCB that can be software
though there's no guarantee that the one
we just saw is a hardware level defect
didn't see any visual artifacting just a
crash which does not occur I'll note on
our 12 or so our TX cards that we have
for review samples none of those do that
they all made it through 30 minute long
fur mark torture tests so it's unique
behavior to the ones that were sent in
by users who have Hooper just
unfortunately defective cards although
that again that could be software but or
drivers any driver may be so if fire
strikes not wanting to launch last time
this happened I had to restart somebody
have to restart again just put that that
back there
okay we're gonna have to restart it is
not and I don't have a start menu again
that's nice okay and I can't right-click
exact same behavior as last time
right-click it and it dies okay restart
all right we got a couple store orders
to read off thank you as I said if you
go to store documents access dotnet
during the stream I'll try to shout your
purchase out where you're from and we
very much appreciate it helps us do
these streams because they are different
types of setup involved anthony from
washington purchased a Ragland hoodie
thank you good timing on that with the
the cooler weather coming up if you want
a lightweight hoodie for when to
actually we've got thicker ones for
winter coming out or already out on the
store too if you want either of those
there on the store though and then we
got one from Chris in Oregon who
purchased a limited edition foil graph
logo shirts thank you Chris okay it's
our back up
crashed on fur mark let's do x by now so
we validated one card was not producing
immediate issues we might switch back to
that one later one card was had very
severe artifact in and then this one
we're still it's TBD what's going on
let's run that and I'm gonna do more
diagnostics off stream but I just wanted
to walk through the basics of validating
the failures on all of them with you all
so you can see what's going on
super chats neo snake gaming two dollars
the artifact reminds me of a bad DDR
overclock yes it's it's very similar to
a bad GG dr overclock as well like too
high or you miss the memory strap Irish
giant two dollars what cpu are using it
is not the 1780 xee that one is is in
the other room hopefully we can rerun it
through tests because we need to get a
machine back up and running for a rip J
revisit soon probably work on that next
week maybe all right so it's running god
this is an eighty eighty sixty K though
to answer the question zdg five dollars
or r-tx rainbow texture FX on yeah
it was very very rainbowed earlier a
tweet of that one out if you want to if
you missed it if you join the stream and
you missed it you can go to twitter.com
slash gamers Nexus you don't need an
account I don't think and you can see
the image I tweeted earlier of some
artifacting on I think was this card
back here where this one is still warm
by the way this one was was rainbow in a
bit so had some visual artifacts looked
like memory artifacting tweeted out an
example of that if you want to see it
and it's festive artifacts people are
saying about that one it just works yes
yes it does
hey Steve it's Bobby have you gotten to
my card yet let me see which one yours
is not sure I will have to look I'll
have to look through my list of people
who've sent them in assuming you are
also named if you're Robert then I might
have let's see which one is that f1
where's the f1
f1 is out here somewhere oh there it is
f1 might be the first if you are Robert
and you purchased a founders edition
card then we worked on this one earlier
so on stream at the beginning of the
stream I was having difficulty
reproducing artifacting in any quick
capacity got impatient switched it in
the lab we have reproduced artifacting
issues and actually the biggest issue
was artifacting during a driver install
an inability to install drivers so that
was the bigger issue with this one-offs
revisited but it was not not spitting
out horrible errors today and if you're
not Robert then I have a lot of other
cards so I need to look through the list
okay so that's still running a crap it
froze with fur mark earlier we're just
gonna see if it survives a bit longer
and times by it seems to seems to die
right when I want to give up on it but
this is a gigabyte card so it's it's a
bit out of the norm for what we're
seeing since most of our founders
Edition got a super chat from open $92
windows flash is a few times before
booting I'm not sure I didn't if it does
I didn't catch it or you asked or are
you saying yours does that message
unclear it could be a display port cable
issue if it's yours or if it's ours for
that matter I roll ones $5 hey hey Steve
I love the work what's your dream PC
current gen or what would you like to
come out sometime in the future I mean I
I'm looking forward to benchmarks in the
99 80 XE because I I guess at this point
my idea of a dream PC is a system on
like on this bench platform over here
with a 540 millimeter radiator on it and
the crazy liquid setup and then putting
the radiators in a nice bucket that's
kind of my version of a dream PC right
now
so 99 80 actually once that comes out
will be a lot of fun for that
okay so we're still waiting for a
failure on this particular card and we
got a couple super chats actually let me
check on normal chat for a bit - so
what's what's chat say Indiana Jones
artifact found four point five gigahertz
on 2700 X is easy but don't put any
workload on it close up okay yeah I mean
four point five isn't easy if you put it
under work workloads of any kind you are
still out of three is Adam Schumann five
dollars still out of three XT logo
shirts and try one if we don't we might
have some in cotton and we definitely
have actually we have a lot of 3x left
most of our stock left on this shirt is
3x so if you really want 3x we
definitely have 3x of this one and some
4x of this one and then if we don't have
3x on the tri-blend t logo I'll take a
look and see if we can place them for
our next order we do try to get most the
sizes so this one is extra small to 4x
sometimes we'd go up to 5x on some of
the other ones is this Linus tech tips
no it's over there I think they're
probably streaming right now to build a
ghetto Linus chiller we actually so we
did our own version of a chiller and it
was an ice bucket like an 80 quart
cooler filled with ice water and
radiators so that was our version of it
how's he gone he done cool thanks
yeah all right so we have a this one
seems to be working better than the
previous one so this particular card is
is not exhibiting the same type of
artifacting failure as the others in the
sort of few minutes we're testing them
here today now once I put it under an
overnight workload or an hour long
workload that might change but it is
looking better than the previous cards
power draw is reasonable as well it's it
has not passed the previous peak of 445
watts so it looks okay it frozen fur
mark but no artifact needs to be found
yet
let's switch cards this is the gigabyte
one and like I said there could
definitely be problems with this the
user certainly had problems with it but
we'll have to test it further offline
let's do we tested this one do you want
I don't know if I've tested that one can
you give it a shot though that backplate
again very hot but that means it's doing
its job you want the backplate to be hot
because if it's not then that means
there's no contact between the backplate
and the the components on the back of
the PCB so let's try one I can't see
from this side all right
actually we don't even need that I just
need some PCIe cables this one I'm like
I said I'm not sure if I've tested this
one but I probably have notes on what
the error was for the owner okay and
we're just gonna see if we can produce a
similar artifacting on these so if
nothing else you get to see a
representation of what your peers in the
gaming community are running into with
their various cards
that's all connected good to go
okay I need to catch up
ahaha I see she's someone correcting
people and minuses name saying it's
Canadian ruin Weiser Linus a couple
store orders thank you so we got one
from Kevin in South Carolina actually
not too far who purchased one of the
blue and whites mouse pads that we have
which I don't have one next to me here
but we have so we do have some how we
got that black and blue ones made and
coming in or actually in the process of
being made I should say
but thank you Kevin for picking up one
of those on the store we appreciate it
of course and that cards booted so I
need to do ad D you again
and install drivers and see if this one
produces artifacts like the e one you
want is the worst one we've had so far
so and I've been in contact with all the
owners about their cards so if you have
one sent in to me and I'm working out
tonight you probably don't know which
which letter like what I've labeled it
but I'll let you know what we find as we
find stuff on the cards and then you'll
probably be RMA and some of these I
would imagine what I'm curious about is
how the RMA process is going for people
okay
now twenty atti cards won't have
problems with multi-monitor setups what
about the dead cards and those stuck at
1300 so the one stuck at 1350 dead cards
we don't know you probably saw RMA those
at least that's what I'm hearing so it's
artifact you know if it's genuinely dead
then probably have the army I know Sam
who might be in chat still had an issue
where his was just continually degrading
at the heap down clock in the memory to
a point where it's just not useful and
usable anymore so that's one where it'll
have to be are made probably and we'll
see if we can reproduce that issue as
for the 39 or megahertz card from
everyone I've spoken to who works at
these companies no one else has been
able to reproduce that issue and not
solve it with the BIOS flash I think we
might have a fix for that one I got a
new v bios in I need to validate a bit
more but it does look like it's been
solved with a new especially I like it
not special but just a new release B
BIOS I'm not sure if anything changed in
there or if just rewriting it with a
different BIOS than the previous version
may be helped I don't know unscrew the
power I think it was a power delivery
like measurement issue like the hardware
monitor on the power circuitry might be
miss reading how much power is going
into its with down clocking don't know
that's our hypothesis on it but we'll
see I card might be fixed I don't know
okay who did I stop on previously oh
yeah we got Kevin's order I've got
another order in from Adam Thank You
Adam from Alabama purchased a foil logo
shirt as well thank you for grabbing one
of those like I said we're very happy
with these shirts they are super
comfortable
a couple other super chats I'm trying to
figure out where I left off so we got
one problem I'm just gonna go with fit
towels for your name because that's what
your avatar says are you be 400 thank
you did you try to pull V BIOS from
problematic cards and compare md5 with
known good images from archives like
techpowerup unlikely but possible that
is something that I'm doing and
collecting v bios from all the cards I
haven't looked at them yet but we have
them we have serial numbers we have V
BIOS I'm starting to collect serial
numbers on the memory modules and some
of the ICS so between all that stuff
we've definitely got it stored it's just
a matter of figuring out what to do with
it that's always the hard part with a
lot of data it burns when Internet
Protocol it burns when IVs $10 thank you
says I have noticed that my 20 atti has
to have under clocks on the core or it
crashes of various errors usually bad
pool collar in most games and dry rough
they didn't work but memory clock
doesn't change it very interesting so I
haven't messed with underclocking the
core yet but I will keep that in mind if
memory under clocks don't fix or work
around issues on some of these cards
that we have but good to know thank you
also unfortunate that you're dealing
with it probably go through the RMA
process if it persists synergize are $5
are there's our TX cards powered by 8080
XE no powered by an 80 86 K so you've
been hoisted on your own petard for that
one haha we will be working with Sony 90
DX e again soon enough installing gyros
on d1 one of the EFI version 28 et eyes
JW Dickason $10 you did respond to one
of my tweets about a beanie but in
modern day internet I don't know if you
were trolling me
to hear from you directly reassures me
that one might be permissible soon yes
generally if we're talking about
potentially making a product we're
serious about it so now I don't think
it'll be soon but it like it takes a
while to design get samples and then
make the product but we will make them
okay Trevor install for another efi card
see how this one does let me check the
normal chat for a little bit still
rocking a 6700 K and I can upgrade for a
while yet yes 6700 K is perfectly fine
we still have it in one of our test
benches not for GPUs but we have it how
do we know G n did not break these video
cards I don't know what I go like spend
$10,000 on cards and then intentionally
break them does that seem like a
realistic realistic scenario to you I
got emails from all the people who sent
them in their addresses their serial
numbers their own photos and screenshots
of all the problems they've experienced
their total debug history of working on
it so I don't know I don't want to tell
you I can certainly tell you I didn't
spend like multiple thousands of dollars
on cards that I then intentionally broke
at while also posting all over the
internet under different aliases for a
month straight in different languages
that's that's how good I am set a big
ruse first I learned how to speak 10
different languages then I spent twenty
thousand dollars on video cards broke
them and then I did the impossible and
endured reddit long enough to make
multiple accounts with upvote histories
and then post all my dead card that's
what I did
All Right see ya thank you
okay so wonderful plant hatton Steve yes
I can't with it just now thank you
okay so drivers been reinstalled
and my screen and blanked out here for a
second okay so driver for this is good
to go
hashtag ripped their Bower their Bower
is not going to be ripped by our
overclock you nine times ahead
okay uh fur mark I guess do it in the
same order so you got a couple cards
left here but we've tested most of them
we read donut test for K run stress test
alright see if it artefacts give it a
bit of a couple minutes Steve can you
walk on liquid metal surface tensions
pretty high on liquid metal
let's see John's two pens 505 GBP thank
you my MSI 2080 trio appears to be
voltage at limited power hits 85% I set
curve to Rana 1.09 three volts to get
max 2,000 megahertz stable
is it bad silicon oh nice
thank you okay I need to make a note d1
is very bad okay I can note on d1 now I
already had a note and it's a very bad
artifacts even with new driver which is
what I was about to type so this is a
card that came in from a user in
Kentucky and there's only one of those
so if you're watching you know who you
are I'll follow up with you as we look
at this one further but if you're
watching we did manage to reproduce the
issue you described an email I like the
no it's gone it's gonna say I like the
lightning strike just like in the
thumbnail for this live stream and it's
gone give it a minute see if it comes
back it's trying couple tweets from
people saying they're seeing this
happened on their 2080s now just to just
as a reminder no guarantee this is a
widespread issue but it is an issue and
it does exist so if you're your skeptic
all that high score GN xdxdxdxd in chat
yes I suppose instead of F so you can
now submit X DS because that's what we
got lots of X DS that card is bad I
would I would say so
Steve are all these at stock speed or
are they power target increases these
are stock I installed the drivers after
I put the card in and I
and a test and we've been doing that
with time spy as well which is a gaming
des this is gone so this is not coming
back and the cards not even hot so I
unless there's poor contact between a
component that we can't measure without
putting thermocouples on it I question
whether it's a thermal issue just if you
missed it earlier we had this card in a
bit ago it's got thermocouples
everywhere it has some memory modules
got them on vrm components has on the
back the PCB that's what all those wires
are and nothing indicated a thermal
issue on this card now I didn't probe
every single component so I could have
missed one that is getting hot but we
presently have no data to support that
it is an overheating issue on these
cards which is what it was largely
postulated earlier in the week time spy
I guess see if we can reproduce the
issue in a realistic workload is it a
normal bios yes we have not made any
changes to V bios and we've verified
that they're on the stock v bios except
for one that we flashed with an update
that was shown in a previous video
okay time to spy extreme let it go looks
more like a skull with bones under yeah
I was thinking skull crossbones XD okay
something like that an old character
dunno that one's gonna need five or six
remakes yes we will down clock as people
are asking about that we'll do that this
is a good candidate to down clock on cuz
it failed so fast okay a couple store
orders thank you as I said those help us
do the live streams because these are a
lot of extra setup that we don't
normally do and I still have to film two
videos today and stuff to do more after
this so very helpful for the store
documents access not net purchases
during the stream Joseph from Florida
picked up a limited edition grass oil
shirt Thank You Joseph and Gustavo
Gustavo from Florida also picked up a
limited oil shirt so if you see each
other then you know you bought it during
the same stream so no failures yet
enticed by extreme it's only been going
for like 30 seconds we'll give it a bit
longer artifact thing should be pretty
apparent in this one if it happens
another store order just came in I'll
read out Andre from Michigan picked up a
limited oil shirt as well thank you
Andre so let me see how is the stock on
those doing and then I need to also read
some super chats a normal chat all that
stuff Dan that's like 10k and video
cards on the table yes but most of them
don't work they they have no inherent
value that they need to be are made by
the owners once we're done working with
them and we very much appreciate those
of you who have sent them in on loan so
we can I just seen that this is a
problem that exists helps a lot because
up until I could see it personally you
see a lot of reddit posts and kind of
question like okay did that user do
something wrong is it their fault and
it's not so that was helpful to get the
cards to just kind of validate that
point you never know with internet
internet posts and issues so what's
stock looking like we have zero large
left on this shirt so large is gone
we've got a couple medium we have a
couple small couple X extra small we
those are extra small is very unpopular
but they do sell through it's a couple
extra small small medium we have one XL
left of the foil graph logo shirt so
there's one excel on stored I gave Miss
Texas dot net 0 to X and then we've got
the most three X and actually couple
four X as well so those sizes are still
in stock we actually we have a little a
lot more 3x no artifacts yet artifacts
are pretty bad and infirm arc which
might indicate power delivery but we
really don't know without looking more
closely at it was our power consumption
at we are at total system draw 340 watts
which is not that high but not abnormal
4 times by extreme that's total system
draw that's not just the GPU and then
we've got a couple super chats I'll take
oh yes the question about the twenty
eighty trio being voltage limited in
power hits eighty five percent so if
you're saying that you have it set to
stock a hundred percent and it's stuck
at eighty five percent that sounds like
there's a problem with the card try ddu
the driver and reinstall four is just in
case something simple like that and if
you're setting a curve to run it
ho a nice I think this happened last
time I was reading your question man
that's a really good one I need to go to
the stream and try and screenshot it
when it comes through
okay so no there's we get some XD's in
chat maybe are those X DS again yes same
symbol is the G on discord patreon only
yes it is what sizes do you have for
Dragons unfortunately don't have any
dragon shirts right now it's as if it's
in high demand we can look into it
I'm just getting a screenshot from the
livestream so I can tweet that one out
so what card is this this is card d1
card d1 very bad artifact in time spy
extreme and firm art okay and I'll tweet
out the link to the live stream too and
then get back to the chats so if you
have a comment about what just happened
there posted in chat and by the time I
look at it it should be scrolling
through a live stream for artifact in
here let's look at chat screen still
black by the way this card seems to do
that after it after it artifacts it
seems to go black so I think what I need
to do is probably put thermocouples on
that one just to validate that one I
still say it's it's the original Space
Invader it does look like space invaders
you are right
two different apps same artifacting
symptom isn't that Wheeling itself not
necessarily not if it's the same problem
GN is discriminating against dragons hey
man
send your dragon measurements in and
we'll look into making clothes for it or
for you if you are a dragon sorry
arty XD on press d for artifact in
pirate skulls maybe yes that is one of
the things we're discussing as a
possibility came here for artifact was
not disappointed unless you were looking
for literal artifacts in which case
you'd be very disappointed looks like
space invaders are these not just a
small percentage of models that are bad
in every launch so yes that is a point
I've been trying to make over and over
tonight
and I saw another question about the
1350 card I'll try and remember but to
the point of is a small percentage of
models the answer is yes as far as we
are aware this isn't like a widespread
issue I have I'll say it again about a
dozen r-tx cards between twenty seven
twenty eight to twenty eighty I none of
them have done this so we have no
present in-house models that did this
all of them are on loan and I had to
solicit them and ask online for people
to send them in so I would say we still
have a lot of them here I'm impressed by
the amount we were able to get is it a
widespread issue the answer is probably
no but we don't have a way to confirm
that and as for what's causing the issue
or does it happen on every launch the
answer is we don't know what's causing
it yet we're looking at them
does it happen on every launch every
launch has bad cards but this specific
failure is either not something that's
happened typically or at this I want to
say large of a scale but it might not
even be a scale thing in terms of
numbers sold it might just be that it's
a scale thing in terms of money spent
twelve hundred dollars you're probably
more likely to complain if it doesn't
work so especially if the RMA is is
somehow not satisfactory for you so it
could be a bit of sample bias here and
that's why we're not saying this is like
the widespread issue was fixed that was
the BSO DS multi monitor g-sync high
refresh those are all BSOD issues all
cards effect
this it does not appear to be a
widespread issue so just try and temper
your expectations there but you know I
think people would be rightfully upset
if it's $1,200 doesn't work and they
can't get a return quickly but from what
I've heard the returns are going fairly
well if that's not true for you let me
know and I'll look into it so still
black screen power draw is that 170
watts right now a total system which is
actually very high that would indicate
that it's still doing things so just
reset it
that's card d1 that one seems very
unhappy Oh the 13 50 megahertz cards
don't asked if I looked at the shunts
and the 1350 card appears to be I mean I
I can't see any physical hardware
defects on it but we do have a potential
fix for it it's probably be bios related
so I'll talk more about that later once
I confirm it okay let's do this let's
let this run one more time at least with
a an under clock of some kind just to
see if that helps do you know how long
it took to freak out a couple minutes
maybe fer mark was faster so let's do
fir mark just cuz it freaks out faster
than x pi
and I'm gonna run in 8:40 2160 okay
mm-hmm so let's do minus 100 on the
memory this one died almost instantly
last time and then I'll try a down clock
on the core as well so we'll just watch
that for a second and see if it freaks
out just like last time with down clock
the memory
which is what some people have said
helps and the owner of this card also
said artifacting so it looks like our
findings are aligning with theirs so
yeah this one doesn't take too long if
it is gonna if it is gonna freak out
did he answer my question about why a
failing GPS shows XD X Oh and xD we
actually don't know I I don't know if
it's like a hex debug go don't know if
it's skull and crossbones I don't know
what it means no character but it
happens on all of them so it's it's cool
I guess at least you can recognize it
okay
so they're hiss okay so once again
freaking out with this time fir mark and
uh 100 megahertz memory under clock so I
we can try a bigger under clock or a
core under clock next that would
probably be the next thing to look at
yeah that's down clock in the memory
we'll also down clock the IMC yes that
is well I mean it down clocks the memory
controller on the GPS not quality it's
quantity okay what exactly are you doing
right now we have a stack of video cards
that our viewers sent in on loan and
they noted that they are defective in
some way and so the the concern was
largely either bsod is which have been
mostly fixed with a driver update or it
is related to artifact in which you just
saw and the artifact in zone one we're
looking into is we're trying to figure
out how many of these do the artifact
see and I've already looked at a bunch
of others we have a bunch of that I'm we
got more coming in from viewers and
readers and so we're in the the
reproduction process of trying to figure
out if these issues are something we can
find on the cards that others have seen
and once we validate that the issue
exists on the card on our hardware we've
tried on multiple platforms now the next
step is to try and figure out if there's
a common thread between them so without
like a 3d x-ray scanner we can't root
cause down to silicon but we can at
least see I don't know is there a common
thermal problem and what's realistically
going to happen is we're more likely to
rule out things that aren't the case
then find the exact case so thermals
were largely stated as the problem
online and it seems that that may not be
true because we've run cards with no
heatsink except for on the GPU then the
memory goes out a hundred degrees and it
didn't artifact so that's a one-off but
the point is that anecdotal one officer
is that it's not
some switch that flips and that card was
never exceeding with the cooler on it I
think 80 or something like that so
that's what we're looking at though now
the next step is to do another under
clock on the core or the memory or
something like that
this artifacting typically software
hardware so typically if you're
overclocking is the best example because
if you're overclock and you might push
the memory too high and you'll see
artifacting so that would be kind of
hardware that's been driven too hard now
we want fir mark just cuz it fails
faster fails enticed by extreme too but
takes a little longer okay so let's go
with that
and we're gonna let's just stick with
the memory theme for now how far down
can I drag this slider - a thousand okay
let's maybe not go that hard see - 400
next thing will be the core and then
power it's kind of amusing we don't
normally do tests of can we get the
hardware stable we do how unstable can
we make it while still getting a score I
need to tweet this this image out it's
pretty good - Nick Nick light from Linus
tech tips tweeted activate windows got
them referring to with their own
comments if you are wondering why we're
running not activated on their system I
would refer you to their video because
the answer is these test systems get
blown away all the time so they don't
live very long
someone said referring to refer to the
XD artifact and they said that looks
like some hotel wallpaper it actually
kind of does couple store orders thank
you I need two super chats next well we
get the store orders first so Gary from
Washington purchased one of the shirts
up we got a failure okay
that's minus 400 on the memory seems to
be about the same time for failure power
draw
still quite high so it's still
processing did not exceed our previous
peak so power draw is not crazy here and
their artifacts follow the mouse if you
care when you move it around
did you never do the dry-ice
overclocking stream no but we have a
plan for that we're just kind of waiting
on something so way down some hardware
maybe next week ok no it's not wallpaper
it's space invaders yes it's actually an
easter egg are we there yet we are we
just just got there again so I don't
know I guess - thousand see if it does
it again and if not we enjoy - on the
core that's the same test
it's a same exact test just drag that
all the way down if it'll even run like
that run tests okay so the cat was - hey
we had Gary from Washington but just
something from the store thank you Gary
that helps sustain our live streams as I
said extra effort to do these so we very
much appreciate the direct support
darshan or darshan from Ontario picked
up one of our anniversary mugs thank you
for picking that up oh and also a cobalt
blue tear down logo the pint glass so
we've got those beer glasses as well and
they have been consistently popular a
couple more store orders to read before
super chats and I'll keep an eye on that
fur mark run where - that's - a thousand
offset on the memory right now we're
just trying to see that improved
stability - 500 did not - 100 not marks
on from Texas picked up a GM keychain
thank you much appreciated
Erin from Washington also purchased one
of the foil logo shirts the graph shirt
the remaining few we have Matthew from
Portland picked up a shirt as well oh
not a not a faux one though because it's
large and we're out of large it was the
anniversary edition teal logo the non
foil the the tried and true teal logo
shirt okay so we're still waiting on a
failure for this one we got interrupted
twice on this super child we try it one
more time maybe it'll trigger a failure
the MSI trio I think all I have to do is
read John tu penses super chat and it'll
cause these fail so invalid testing same
super chat killing all cards it's all
your fault
I keep trying to answer your question
about the twenty eighty I'll get it
eventually
I mean I don't know how clearly is just
gonna black screen again I'm gonna
leave it alone for a minute and see if
it comes back it seems to be gone once
it artifacts though this particular card
so that one's pretty bad that was a
minus thousand on the memory so not
conclusive not like extremely hard to
test in but kind of ad hoc testing for
tonight on stream I need to look into is
it overclocked no it's massively under
clock it's probably worse than a 1080i
right now maybe not that bad but it's
getting there I need time to clock the
core next and maybe drop power okay
while that's black screen let me answer
a couple Super chats because the Super
chats apparently trigger failures you
ought to make it fail you send one in
apparently so John's two pence once and
for all five toddlers Thank You Miami
side twenty eighty trio appears to be
voltage limited power hits eighty-five
percent set the curve drawn 1.0 a 93
2000 megahertz stable is it bad silicon
if you have to set a curve specifically
to run over 85% there's a problem
maybe drivers if it runs out a hundred
percent under normal testing make sure
not CPU limited it could be that your
CPU bottlenecked in which case your GPU
might not be pulling full power because
it might be limited elsewhere so look
into that potential variable and then
drive a refresh 2000 megahertz is
basically an overclock so is it bad at
2000 megahertz not particularly some
we've pushed cards higher we've had
cards that don't do as well it just
depends but I would say it check for a
CPU limitation if you're running at 85%
because that's not normal of a suit of a
$5 no message thank you Michael
Michael Morris $5 went from water to air
on an EVGA 980 but don't have the middle
plates that had the throne pads will
this kill my GPU ban find the last two
months
water to air water to air oh because I
guess you converted it and you can read
it back and you're missing parts on a
980 don't have the middle plates that
have the thermal pads if by middle plate
you mean the the base plate the one that
sits between the PCB and the cooler you
should have that
will it kill the card I guess I'd have
to see the card the problem is that if
there's no you just have to run your
fans at a higher speed because like the
memory and the VR I'm can run within
spec without direct contact : with just
air but it's got to be a lot of air and
you're pushing it through a fin stack
that's hot from the GPU and pass a bunch
of heat pipes so you need a high CFM to
push through all that stuff in the way
and get to the parts so ideally you have
the plate the base plate let's restart
this J $10
I just got an RMA 28 e TI FTW 3 as soon
as I installed x1 it killed it 3 power
lights old card is back in it now fun
stuff yeah I don't know I don't even
know I I kind of doubt that it was the
software that killed hardware but I
don't know there's a lot of different
problems with these cards as is normal
and that means that there's not a
consistent problem that's probably a
good thing these are the consistent
problem it's artifacting ok so we did a
- thousand offset on the memory let's
try not touching the memory this time
and let's do a core under clock and then
maybe after that a power under under
power configuration and - 250 core
I'm gonna leave this open this time just
to confirm if it's working and after all
of this we might be able to kind of get
some ideas if it's a power delivery
issue if the if under powering it fixes
some of the artifacts in but we're not
under power right now it is down clocked
so typically in Farmer Mark does not
enumerate the clock the same way so it
runs lower frequencies and that's
because it's a burn on the prm's this
typically runs at about 1500 1600
megahertz infer mark we're off minus 250
so it is applying correctly the under
clock is working we're gonna let it run
it tends to fail within a couple minutes
if it is going to fail and we're just
trying to diagnose why these cards are
or well maybe not why exactly they're
failing but figure out what can bypass
the failing and and then think from
there if that if there's any obvious
solution from that point new be 50 and
okay I can test my 28 ET i if it if it
only arrives pre-ordered the EVGA in
September still not arrived but that's a
revision 2 to 5 it's on oh you're
talking about mining maybe it's on ETH
and the memory intensive this is
referencing the previous question or
note from Newby so yeah let us know what
you find on your 28 ET i so one earlier
was asking about how mining might be
might produce artifact and if it does or
if it produces other memory errors and i
don't know but if you do that kind of
thing let us know the official ash 88
$10 thank you hi Steve I've been over
talking my 20 atti but I've encountered
a blue screen of death this happened
after going over an 800 offset of the
memory
have you encountered BSO DS do to
overclock memory yes definitely I've
encountered bsod is due to any kind of
overclock if you push too high it'll
potentially BSOD me solvent stream
previously need to find Delta clocks so
try try this even though 800 is failing
you try 980 see if that's stable because
980 seems to be like a memory strap or
something and there
should be consistent on all cars it
doesn't mean it will work but you might
find that sometimes a higher clock is
more stable than a lower clock or a
lower clock might produce better
performance than a higher clock depend
where it is on a sliding scale ich
Winstar beats two dollars ten cents
retrospective content bit on the viewer
sensitive views yes we definitely want
to do it we have a video coming up
that's already filmed talking out all
those parts so a great idea we've
already we're already on it and right
now if you're just tuning in or trying
to see if this card has been failing
consistently with artifacting flickering
black screens so we're trying to see if
we underclock the core will it happen
again
under clock in the memory did not seem
to have an effect but maybe the core
will able Lincoln good to have you here
since $7 they adjusted the $5 note for
inflation I guess send Linus money soon
on the LAN show and keep 2 for tacos I
see now
now I understand I really have lineups
alone this week i harassed him two weeks
ago and threw him off his game when
you're eating the super chats sir man
wants everyone $10 thank you could you
do an OSI tutorial on the 2700 X to get
the same OSI leichter Bauer when he got
4.5 boost I asked you to me to get the
same overclocked Esther Bowers asking a
lot but on some cores and 4.25 all core
somehow I'm not able to get it working
I'm not alone yeah he's Silicon lottery
matters a lot
motherboard vrm quality matters a lot
cooler matters a lot so the colder you
can get the core the more you can push
the voltage and then you might use some
fans on the vrm to depend on how good
that heatsink is so I would say push for
a better cooler on the core make sure
the VR arms aren't overheating and and
try from there be be cautious with how
high you push voltage though okay 4.25
I'm just doing a control I have to find
where wise because super chat scroll
that 425 okay hasn't failed yet so maybe
there's something to this core under
clock on this particular model how long
does it take to crash the time spy this
card crashed and maybe three minutes and
time spy something like that somewhere
between two and five it's a little
faster than four marks reason for mark
just for purposes of being in a stream
but time spiked extreme does cause a
failure and times by is a very good
gaming benchmarks Tandon same type of
workload CPU barely doesn't anything GP
does a lot people ask how is this count
problem the answer is we are not clear
but I mean I can't validate this but
everything I've been told and would
trust thus far is that there is no
failure rate above what is normally seen
it's just that this type of failure
seems to be like they're all the same
type of failure and it's it's a very
loud failure because it's a $1,200 card
so failure rate is something like under
0.1% for some board partners under 0.01%
for others and part of that a sample of
bias because if you're under point out
1% you might look at the cards they
haven't go oh they actually they haven't
sold many and all of them are custom
PCBs or something like that so that can
affect the data we're looking at we
don't know Nvidia's RMA rate they've
told us it's not a broad issue they
haven't seen a lot of them we really
have to just take them at their word for
that because I have no way to cross
validate it and I don't I haven't had
any sources inside telling me otherwise
and then Roman dev our works that case
can he did a video talking about how
there was like 1.5% RMA it was pretty
normal as well so this is a common
problem probably not but it's common
enough that you're hearing about it
online and it's an expensive card it
sucks to be left out in the cold with
one of these especially because it is so
hot so we wanted to test it and see if
we could reproduce the issue and see it
for ourselves and just on cue there it
is well look at that it's like a that
making cool tattoo is like a skyline so
nice so that's what's happening on song
that's at - 250 core I don't know if it
lasted longer than previously or not I'd
have to go back and look but and by the
way this is a bug so if you're worried
that the fans aren't spending they
actually are but it's misreporting and
this software
so that did not survive just to prove a
quick point though so sensors fan speed
41% currently so I mean yeah it's I'm
looking at it it's spinning but just in
case you don't believe me
there's gpu-z tiny 41% idle which is
where it should be that's the that's the
floor okay see if it could be power
fluctuation with a flat curve we can
look at that there's some testing I'm
going to be doing offline for for time
reasons okay we got a store order thank
you and now you need to go through some
more super chats I'm behind on them I'm
gonna try and get through as many as I
can I mean I'll get through all of them
it's just give me some time to catch up
I'll get through all of them before I
end up stream though Sarah from Michigan
it looks like purchased a key chain in
one of the limited foil shirts thank you
very much
and what is super chat and chat saying
so guys how's our $35 thank you you and
your team are amazing keep up the great
work well thank you for watching
supporting us it's extremely helpful and
much appreciated
Adam Schumann senior $5 you are still
out of the 3x so I got that one t logo
shirt yes and we still have 3x of these
we might have 3x with some others I need
to look but we'll try and order some
more of those we do have 3 X's of these
though 9 tal x5 a GBP hey from the UK
thanks for keeping me sane on the night
shift glad to give you something to
listen to
Gangji films $2 worth upgrading to a 20
atti from a 1080 TI probably not I don't
know depends on what you need right so
like you're pretty happy with your
performance now then the answer is no
and if you're not happy with your
performance now and an extra 30% will
get it for you the answer is yes if you
have the money to spend on that so
Maeve's do you like a lot of multi high
res multi-monitor gaming I would say VR
but it's not that intensive so not I
don't think it necessarily it is but if
you're not getting what you need
out of a 1080i then you really don't
have many other options Sean Collins did
our Steve can you explain that chips on
Intel six SSD I don't think so because
I'm not familiar with why this is a
question
six hundred series maybe let me let me
tell you this check alan mal ventanas
reviews from pc / i always like to send
people his way for SSD questions he's an
expert in the space i think he's the
best as the reviewer so check out his
content and he should probably have far
better explanations than I give I'm not
not afraid to tap out on questions I
don't know the answer to crack on PC
Hong Kong $25 thank you is a CPU 28 core
is five gigahertz no no no it's not it's
lady 86 K so this wasn't let's let me
get this running while I read super
chats because it does take a few minutes
to fail I don't know - 500 I will try a
like a curve up later they vote
frequency curve later Austrian that did
not set what's the lowest that even goes
here - a thousand okay well let's try
again - 450 please apply okay so this
one fails n times by an FIR mark
and from that okay that that's not what
it's supposed to look like so that's
probably because last time I guess I
need to restart between the last failure
and this one so let's go ahead and give
that a restart ha ha ha instant fail
okay so in uh maaske Saudi $1 99 thank
you Steve I'm the owner of c1 thanks for
the help our ma arrives Wednesday oh
yeah I've got yours right here too just
go back to EVGA so we worked with EVGA
who were actually our media rep stepped
in and handled our mas for a couple of
people who sent cards to us that needed
to be replaced and he said his job isn't
even the army department and he replaced
them for the people so it got to give
them credit for fast response and
getting the the viewers sorted out who
loaned us their cards then their cards
are gonna be going I think this might be
the other one that failed I think their
cards are gonna be going back to EVGA
this weekend though so evj will diagnose
them further and send them to us as
necessary or send their information to
us rather so glad you got your your RMA
shipping out to you that quickly though
glad we could provide some assistance
while doing all the troubleshooting ok
so let's try this again it's so this is
so weird I feel like normally I get a
crash and I'm saying ok let's try this
again
except it's to increase voltage and
increase the clocks this time we're
trying to decrease everything let's
improve stability the other direction
from a stock ok well that's gonna
eventually pop up
try - 450 - 250 didn't helps out under
power might be the next thing to do and
I run gpu-z this time just so we can
keep an eye on things that precision
doesn't report ok launch see if it dies
and I know that's not really gonna be
legible for camera but I will be able to
check it and read it out to you in the
event of a failure for this one
alright so super chats Sean Devine $5 so
yeah I get it right people it's Canadian
rule miser at Linus I'm about 50 minutes
behind on super Chad's but I can catch
up let's see if I read about ten of them
I can get almost the current time luke w
$10 why does Geekbench always crash my
8086 K when stable on everything else
unit 5 gigahertz and 1.4 volt B core
also when will mod Matz be in stock the
large mod mat that I have on the table
here so this is the 4 foot by 2 foot
model the large mod map I say model
because there's a medium one that we're
working on making but it won't be ready
till probably January so a large one we
have another round of these coming in
early December so especially if here in
the US if you place a backorder on it
now because they've been selling out
constantly so they're back ordered
placed a backorder we still have
inventory for this round so you'll get
one in the US definitely before
Christmas international match or you can
email us at support gamers Lexus not net
and our distributor will help you figure
that out for timing after that our next
round is probably gonna be January end
of January maybe February it's kind of
depends on Chinese New Year and stuff
like that for manufacturing that is some
of the most spectacular failure we've
seen tonight
hahaha and then to answer your question
about why does Geekbench crash when
everything else is stable it's probably
the type of workload I don't know what
Geekbench does I never use it but AVX
would be a good example if it's a DX if
games are stable but it's doing some AVX
load I don't know what Keith's crunch
does then that would explain it you do
an AV x offset negative offset on the
multiplier if you want to hold by point
on everything but but a V X for example
so underclocking the core did not help
but I didn't offset I didn't do like a
vote frequency curves we'll try that
later let's do one more thing I want to
under power it now I'm gonna restart so
people keep sending hugs and kisses
every time they die because the I guess
the X DS will also look like XO hoes I
just now caught on to that I saw people
saying it
it's the gpu-z strobe light
okay so I guess I don't know I guess -
power this time and just to be clear for
anyone tuning in now times by does the
same thing and that's a gaming workload
so it's not just cuz we're torturing the
power components with fairmark times by
is doing the same thing I'm just using
this because it launches faster and it
fails faster so same mode of failure
just faster window to create the failure
okay that's annoying literally didn't do
anything
figured I'd at least be able to get that
application open before it crashed so
this card is getting decreasingly happy
at this point
it's not crazy hot that backplates like
under 50 C so that doesn't mean there
isn't a hot component but again based on
the one that's wired up with a bunch of
thermocouples it's probably fine let's
restart it see if it keeps doing that
might have killed the killed the drivers
with it that last time okay so we got a
question from Michael Thompson for 99 -
tech tips is good okay you figure out
what the last word is am I gonna say the
rest of because I don't want to be taken
out of context we like working with - he
addresses a different audience may not
be the same people it's a very important
audience we're getting newcomers into
the space and then they eventually come
over to us we've seen that a lot by the
way with people who started out - and
they discovered us later so he he plays
an important role I told him once that
he is like the anchor store in a
shopping center he's he's the reason
people come to the space and hopefully
they find our store next to it and this
is what you would call bad this is a
this is undesirable behavior carted this
card's really unhappy now so I think
this one might be done I also take it
apart and look at it later because it
was kind of holding for money not really
it was holding for like three minutes
but I would say this one it was clear
this one was already going through RMA
channels but now it's we'll do some
further testing on it it's definitely
going through our army channels so
that's card d1 we had e one was also
failing artifacting either catastrophic
ly it's not like they blew up so do you
want not doing so well look at that more
later I think I think we're done with
that one maybe do one more while I catch
up on super chats this one perhaps I won
okay
I think there's one card here than one
of those EVGA cards that definitely
works now after the driver update don't
need power cables so this is I won I
have I don't unless I did at the start
of the stream I don't think I did I
don't think I've tested this one yet
okay
off to the races for that one so you
check on chat while that's booting out
where you have to do drivers again she's
done ski Steve here
Wow so that cards someone saying do the
smell test I've actually used that this
week and it does not smell like smoke
so no pops components it would be it's
really obvious when a component pops
I'll tell you why I know later have to
investigate further yeah so we'll see
well retest that once more might need
some time to chill out for a bit
whose d1 is that what that was
d1 d1 is for the gentlemen and Kentucky
and I'll be in contact with you later
we'll do some more Diagnostics on it and
then you can go through your RMA windows
not happy after that failure okay I need
to read some super chats or we're still
behind all I have to do is read like 10
and we're almost to present time so
Frederick's du Quai $20.00 Canadian
thank you hi Dale
not my name but okay we'll go with it
hi Dale I upgraded horizons
1700 X to a Pentium g46 20 and saw no
framedrops gtx 980ti I'm so confused by
this message that's not an upgrade so I
think it's a joke
well we're gonna go with that Michael
Thompson 199 it's a conspiracy he
admitted it this is back to when I was
saying that I I of course am behind all
of this Ian Powell $2 well done I will
stick with my 70 now just to be clear
yeah probably wait a little bit so let's
clear it up but it's not supposed to be
a widespread issue we'll see screens
black
I don't think windows liked that last
like what the card did to it last time
let's give it a bit and I'll read some
more Robert Velasquez 5.4 an 8700 K with
nati is the real world in game
difference between enabling Emma sighs
enhanced turbo and manual aid
overclocking the five gigahertz
noticeable 8700 K what does that boost
tears at 4.7 I can't remember where that
boost here any more things I want to say
it's a 4.7 or something is it different
between enhanced turbo so enhanced turbo
will go to the highest single thread
speed and I don't have that memorized
I've a TA just 6k memorized but if five
gigahertz all core is higher than the
fastest single thread then yes because
the fastest single thread with et will
remove the power limit duration
limitations if there are any and it will
also boost to the all course the fastest
single thread you can test it really
easily those Cinebench is great for that
minnow cout 94 99 how does that ugh
keyboard it's actually okay so as a
keyboard it's fine the switches are
standard I don't know if they're red or
brown I think they're brown it's fine I
have a few things I don't like with it
like I've talked to EVGA already but I
want the the Windows key needs to be on
the other side where it always is and if
they're gonna leave it split like this
at least have the FN the function and
the windows can be the same cap because
in software you can switch these two
functions so you can make this one over
there and vice versa but the keys are
different sight the caps different size
so you can't switch how much it's really
unfortunate so that's that's just a
gripe I have with it
the volume slider is kind of funny
because if you are adjusting volume
through software then obviously that
doesn't move with it so if you adjust
your software to 80% and your dials down
to 20
next time you move it it's gonna jump so
a wheel would be better but that's it's
okay as a keyword there I really don't
mind it other than that oh it also why
are you laughing
it also does this pretty nice and I'm
not gonna do it this time
but last time we did that during a
stream Jacob from EVGA said he does he
is the spring load to launch things so I
put a screw on it I launched it in the
air and then realize that's a bad idea
and near an open air test bench it was
fine though it didn't landed it
mechanical flaw five dollars came in
late has this been narrowed down to a
particular lock code is artifacting
reproducible in linux good question not
sure the answer is no and not sure I'm
working on collecting all the serial
numbers and all that stuff still and a
sensor memory and ICS Arthur Zhou let me
I'm just gonna get through a bunch of
super chats give me a few minutes here
actually we don't have too many to go
through so wait where'd it go there it
is oh yeah we don't have many let me get
through these all right there's out $5
thank you for doing this great testing
by the way do you know how long does it
take for these cards to break first day
or a couple of days a weeks
depends a couple of people who sent them
in said if failure was about 70 hours
for artifacting some of them said it was
basically instantly the BSOD s have been
resolved by drivers for the most part
and those were all the time it depending
on your monitor and then I think there
was one that took like a week of just
progressive or degenerative failure
basically Nicolas my oh five dollars
just buy it I wonder if it's because you
forgot to turn off ray tracing no
Kevin's already two dollars thank you no
message
hoorah chess plays TV two dollars that
artifacting symbol is Steve's Jesus fish
XD Cory bears we should make that four
cars Cory bears $4.99 Steve you heard
about us about the beanies now hear us
about the done ski one ski with included
dragon sizes and
Steve pattern hashtag one ski I like the
I like the product name of done ski one
ski how's the license it from kingpin
though because done ski is his word
seventh-day Savior five thighs I just
lost my job
ouch but you've raytrace to my heart
Steve go buy yourself a race race coffee
of this keep your body man yeah good
luck with the job hunt sorry to hear
that definitely best of luck Peter ll
PHP 2500 is that Phillip Philippines
dollars I don't know thank you so much
though whatever amount it is doesn't
matter we we always appreciate it
thanks for showing us how crappy the new
r-tx cards and then I think that's a
peace sign emoji I mean definitely these
ones are problematic absolutely I just
yeah jaw line between I solicited these
so they are bad and then I've got a
dozen others in the storage room that
works just fine so Anna I it's a bit of
a lottery I guess bit dragon or a Brit
dragon two dollars should I upgrade from
a 1070
probably not I don't know depends on on
what kind of money are trying to spend
if you're like ten seventy twenty
seventy know if you're going from ten
seventy two like twenty eighty which is
a 1080 TI or a twenty eighty I and you
have that much money to spend I guess so
but only if you are at a point in your
your performance where you're really
disappointed by it and you need more if
not then just wait there's no reason to
constantly upgrade cycle if you're happy
with performance Auto easy and Elliott's
in SEK twenty what cpu are you using ATM
6k it's not a 79 80 XE but thank you for
keeping them alive
Guido Sarducci $5 just drop 769 on EVGA
I see two black Black Edition 1080 TI I
feel like this will hold me over til the
next generation of cards 2100 or even
Navi yeah a 1080i is a perfectly good
card in fact we have video coming up on
this of all the purchases that our
viewers made at RT X launched 64 percent
of them were 1080 TI's all the video
card purchases you'll see that in our
video coming out 64 percent so that's
all GTX 410 series and and all our TX
and then if you count AMD in there I
think
about 56% so 1080i is really popular
with the r-tx launch r27 is having the
same issue or just 20 ATT I not clear
I have heard mixed stories I have a
couple more to get through keeping ttan
249 $5 did you get my email about
DisplayPort 1.1 cable issue with the
2070 I need to catch up on a lot of
issues about RTX cars we got like a
hundred of them after the last day's
video so probably not I mean I'm sure I
have it but I haven't read them all so I
apologize trying to work through them
while also doing normal work I will read
them although for that inbox Leviathan
priam six dollars hello GN when will the
lightweight Raglan zip hoodie and medium
and small be back and saw great question
I just got a shipping notice for those
today so they are on the way to us now
they're already with with UPS I think so
we'll have those next couple of days
keep an eye out I'll probably tweet when
they're back in Andreas Sheriff two
dollars do a power shut mod and see if
it crashes
I would clear that with the owner first
because that's that's got into
modifications so no plans do that right
now we have other ways to test we can
decrease the power we can increase power
offset stuff like that your software let
me read the last few while we try and
get this thing alive again I'm just
gonna completely shut it down give it a
minute and turn it back on and see if it
wakes back up Windows is very unhappy I
think after the last crash hopefully
it's windows hopefully it's not a
motherboard issue but I doubt it
been barely $7.99 Australian thank you
hey Steve I'm looking to build a new PC
what would you build now on a 99 out of
K platform specifically I guess if I'm
building on an IRA platform I really
want to see how this e3 90 dark is so I
would probably hope personally you ask
me how what I would do so I would
probably hold out another month and see
what does the dark look like is it any
good just because I the X 299 dark I
like to working with a lot and for
boards that are out now the gigabyte
extreme is good it's very expensive to
go that route but I don't know if you're
gonna like push overclocks kind of hard
then I would I would go for the higher
end boards if not there plenty of other
boards to fit your needs
honestly for a GPU if I could find one
like 700 bucks I would still buy a 1080i
though today maaske oh I got yours
earlier Paul hunter five dollars 2600 K
up 4.8 that's very good
r9 290x can I upgrade to a 1080i or do I
need a new motherboard CPU etc so you're
gonna be on I don't know what I don't
know you have to check what PCI
generation you're on but you should be
kind of okay with a single card even
with PCIe two-eckstein you're gonna be
at the limits though so if you are my
son whines about FPS yeah now you're
talking about looking for the best bang
for the for the euro and do you need a
new motherboard TV etc Mikey 2600 acts
2600 K is pretty old if he's just gaming
I don't know yeah I'd I would say a
1080i is a reasonable upgrade if you
have the money to then get a CPU and
motherboard later perhaps in a couple
months because that 1080i will be good
for a while same it the other way if you
want a 2600 X I just I don't think a CPU
upgrades gonna improve your your son's
FPS in an immediate fashion I think it
will help allow the higher end GPUs to
fully leverage the core but I would
start with the GPU if you might have
budget a bit later or you could always
always wait a little longer if he can
wait and try and just go all at once but
let's answer your question very directly
my inclination is that at 4.8 on 2600 K
which is still pretty good we tested it
recently and it was keeping up well
within 1080 TI that to the point where
was actually bottlenecking it a bit so
I'd have to see how it does with the
290x I'm not sure but yeah I would say
my inclination is GPU upgrade and then
CPU maybe a couple months down the line
Alex Forrester if I also my reasoning
for that is because the CPU upgrade will
force a ram upgrade and that's getting
expensive so we read like four more of
these Alex Forrester five dollars thanks
for running these tests my 20 atti has
been running well lately but initially
had quirks and I'm keeping a close eye
on your testing are you good to hear
it's running well if the quirks were
driver related the driver patch update
might have might have helped you out
try Leonard $2.00 when show's over swim
back welcome back the pound when you
left we are now down we were done
through four cards and I think two of
those had severe artifacting issues to
the point where it might have taken out
windows with it this one's trying to get
going I don't think I've even installed
drivers yet the gigabyte card failed in
fur mark but not in times by so mixbag
scarlett tech $9.99 do you think the
archaic scores and tensor cars will
generate more heat and thermally limit
cards once ray-tracing is available I
figure vapor chambers may get saturated
possibly well it's already getting kind
of overloaded by by the heat load it's
dealing with I would assume that
activating more of the GPU would
increase the heat load on the cooler but
seriously hmm but they might be doing
some power gating on the rest of the
cores I'm just changing I'm unplugging
the SSD booting it with that one and
then then we'll see what it does if I
boot it with one again
oh yeah I don't know they might be doing
some clock gating on on the core once
the RT cores are active so we don't know
what the behavior will be just yet new
to this channel 50 and okay hi I'm new
to this channel I've been watching for a
long time keep up the great work
well welcome thank you for watching and
thank you very much for the donation
always helps out thomas Lukens $5 Steve
please do a feature a future piece on
where gallium based CPUs are and why
silicon isn't dead yet
gallium based CPUs I am not familiar
with graphene maybe not qualified to
answer that today but maybe I could do
some research and talk to david cantor
or something like that we could always
always look into that stuff no current
plans but I will look into your question
with David Cantor he's a good source for
that
okay let's see if it actually killed
Windows or not everything is as it
should be
Scott and these five dollars if I am
upgrading from an i5 6,600 K is better
to go and I 787 hurt K or a 99 K for
gaming again how many frames do you
really need 8700 from an i-5 6600 K
first of all if you're only gaming and
you're trying to be like 144 Hertz or
200 Hertz or something crazy like that
yeah 99 K will better get you into that
position but we also really high
favorite 8700 K so I have a hard time
recommending the nine hundred K just
because of the price it's done we the
objectively better chip for gaming but
it's also objectively a lot more money
so again my inclination is 8700 K
because I tend to be more cost conscious
because if the performance if sort of
the the value starts falling off a cliff
you hit diminishing returns as you're
approaching 1900 K I am less inclined to
personally go that route but if you got
lots of money and you want the best I
guess you can go that route my
inclination again there was 8700 K it's
not as big of an upgrade but still a
massive upgrade from an i5 6600 K and
what boot cut are we getting it doesn't
like the OS I think it might have nukes
the OS I might have to reimage that
later or something we'll try it one more
time see a couple more tureen not too
many sebastian crude is 10 euro maybe a
bit off topic on RT extreme but what's
your opinion on liquid metal instead of
normal paste between they see being
cooler i used it on my latest latest
build and i'm afraid about the copper
core it'll be fine don't worry about it
it will color it so it's we have a video
on liquid metal corrosion look that up
look up corrosion on the gamers nexus
channel click the search button type
that in and we have video on it i
explain why you'll get some coloration
on that copper heatsink and it's it's be
kind plated basically almost like
electroplating so take a look at that
content it'll be fine it just means you
have to use more liquid metal than
otherwise so blue screen again it's not
even blue screen it's just like windows
is gone or something let's just do some
basic stuff what do I want command
prompt boot that's not typed proper scan
OS no OS okay that's nice I rebuild BCD
access denied okay well that card might
have blown up the operating system
I don't even know if this is gonna work
probably not yeah okay
let's reboot again I'll make sure well
by us should be set to three mode okay
let me read through the rest of super
chess we might be done I think the
previous card
crashing killed Windows but I will look
into it
I can you can often recover windows just
by moving over some files gallium
arsenide oh that's a good point there
was a content piece about that I'm not
sure that's the current status of that
there we go its back its back okay
Soho last card we're gonna do I guess
I'm not tested this one yet so we still
need to D to you and all that stuff it's
restoring to the state of the previous
card before it got nuked okay didi you
last one we have more but I'm gonna cut
it here after after we see what this one
does sue to our MRF nope okay remove
recursively a question on the horan $10
sorry if I came off as a jerk in the
comments I don't I don't remember your
comments so I think we're good
anyway can you do a custom overclock
turbos and Maxtor was vice all core
verse across can you benefit from this
sort of tweaking the balance core temps
our clocked turbos versus maximum turbos
custom so maybe you can do like if if
what you're asking is study different
course the different clocks then you can
get a bit more stability a bit higher
clock on a single thread it's good for
benchmarking I don't like it for
production or daily use it's good for
benchmarking because the graphics render
thread is often on one thread on the CPA
on the CPU maybe two and so if you
overclock one assuming it ends up with
the task then it can help with
increasing benchmark scores like in x by
extreme but I don't like it for daily
use if that's what your question was not
Shaunda by and prices please bring in
the senior and the analyst as an RT x
expert well I just rebuilt the old set I
got some the final two lights and for it
yesterday so we can do some more videos
there with snowflake on has a special
guest or CEO Seville is a $2.00 test vr+
vive I want to see beat Sabre Steve
dance nope
and uh we did V our benchmark in the
past
pretty interesting content but we kind
of stopped because there's interesting
once and then it's not being interesting
because I don't know market isn't really
there to justify the time expense for us
is tremendous the new PR benchmark it's
completely insane how long it takes
does it requires setup of a whole room
for like multiple days where and you can
no longer do other testings that's a big
opportunity cost and then it's also I
don't know the games aren't super
demanding so once you test it once you
kind of don't need to anymore we'll look
at it maybe at some point once once VR
gets another major push of it does but
on hold presently if review our tests so
if you don't know what I'm doing I'm
installing drivers on the last card
we're gonna test we've had several
artifacting cards tonight previous one
almost blew up some of the software on
the system but last one this is card I
won and who is the owner of this card
this is Henry's card Henry was watching
earlier okay so we're just installing
the drivers super chats and store orders
so we got Sean Collins I'm almost to the
bottle of super chats while this
installs two dollars Australian thank
you I've seen just having a Maasai
afterburner cause artifacts well we've
seen artifacts with nothing also open so
I don't know I guess it's completely
sporadic maybe it might be just
correlation not causation in that case
I'm not sure it's kind of hard to know
because there there's so many different
types of things I can go wrong with
software and hardware space birdie $2
when I overclock my 1060 at all why is
my CPU score drop
instability maybe something like that
probably instability I am z-ray vien
$2.00 8799 30 K answer that question a
bit ago you're upgrading from the 77
hearty K though I don't think in 87 hard
it's a decent upgrade but I don't know I
don't think it's a big enough upgrade 77
hurt K at 5.2 gigahertz 1.3 1 volts it's
pretty damn good so if I were you I
probably wouldn't go to an 87 hard K
from that
that's pretty damn good like that's a
good chip that you have it's probably
one of the best so I I would probably
shoot for ninety nine hundred K for
going full gaming or wait Henry two for
one dollar thank you William to five
dollars is using liquid metal on a high
end air cooler with the price and what
do you think about icy graphite thermal
heads I wouldn't use it on the cooler no
I would use it between the IHS and the
die only between the cooler and the
diets really cut or the IHS sorry it's
kind of irrelevant graphite thermal pads
no no present thoughts I think they're
way overblown they're not as good as
they're made out to me Alan Morris $3
your thoughts on gen 2 or 3 risin versus
Intel no thoughts it's not out I don't
have benchmarks so I'm not gonna
speculate on it okay so that's installed
turn g-sync off just to eliminate that
that vector for failure
and we're gonna reboot this the last one
we're doing we've tested a lot of cards
tonight including those with
thermocouples all over them and showed
thermals weren't an issue on that one
anyway
david kowalski $20 thank you ever
consider reviewing laptops even just
flagships variance in thermal solutions
is push is begging for GN treatment
we've done it we used I used to do it a
lot but the interest wasn't there and
people don't seem to care about a laptop
reviews in quite that way I think I
could find a way to make people care but
the time seems better spent on core
components we've done laptop reviews the
last big one I did was on bloatware what
we've done thermals and it's just I
don't know it may be later but my my
time is better spent on testing other
stuff if we branch out get another
technician maybe we could do laptop
testing again but the interest just
isn't there in our audience specifically
better to work on other stuff also that
we find more interesting - okay let's
start with fur mark just like every
other one I'm actually going to close
precision on this and is dead is it
completely gone yes so we're gonna do
with fur mark we've been starting with
this then we always got a time spike
stream and those create failures just
like games do so let's let that go for a
bit what notes do I have on this card
this one might have been a I don't
remember was this a blue screen or a or
a an artifacting issue I don't remember
which one this was I think this one was
artifacting actually I have photos for
this one hang on let me find those the
owner sent some photos of the issue in
the box which is actually extremely
helpful so I can quick reference them so
this from that owner yes okay
so literal photos all right so this this
particular owner was seeing issues like
this one I suppose
nope it's frozen but they were seeing
stuff like that artifact in and it's
it's kind of weird hold the photo up to
a camera will reproduce it soon soon
enough
I don't know if this was his I think it
might have been I found that post on
Reddit and he may have been the one i
pm'd about that issue
so anyway clearly artifacts in those
examples so it shut down I don't think I
didn't shut it down today I was holding
a photo okay max power has not exceeded
previous max so it didn't freak out on
the power it just shut itself off that's
nice oh did it did you catch it a little
so it artifact it again for a second I
guess hey I did install drivers right
there were drivers on there okay
drivers are gone that has killed them it
crashed and it ate the drivers see if D
detects it
yes Henry says yep that's mine yes it is
okay so again let me address this again
just saw on reddit and videos replacing
our make cards with the new Samsung
memory could micron memory be the issue
it could be there could be bad batches
from micron but there is presently
there's evidence to the contrary
some people have projected that all the
micron memory on the r-tx cards is bad
that's wrong
because the failure rates low enough and
we have a lot of cards other reviewers
have a lot of cards this is an uncommon
issue it's common enough to definitely
be a problem and we're not brushing it
under the rug that's why I'm doing this
but I also want to keep people in check
and remembering that memory suppliers
are added to the roster all the time
so this is the movement to support
Samsung memory is more of a move to
support increased demand for the product
and get more memory suppliers bidding
against each other so that anybody can
drive the cost out of their memories
they can supply more cards with more
memory so although there may be a
correlation
perhaps some batches of micron memory
were bad we don't know it is not
anything as wide region as all micron
memory was bad just to be clear on that
great question though see so someone
says I went 2,700 X to 9900 my VR
experience became much better same
system otherwise keep the great work
thank you that was from Sevilla SA we we
did our on our 1700 PR testing versus
the seven 700 K I was pretty interesting
back in the day Juke Picard a $5 for
Picard hell-blade for VR can murder a
rig trying to hit solid 90 FPS that's a
good point
no room needed to see the game the intro
scene would be an excellent benchmark if
we do it again I will remember that
because hell-blade is an extremely
demanding game so that's a good point
but it's it's still a lot of work even
without them the room space requirement
setting up the tools to do the
benchmarks is is kind of insane it's
their non-standard they're not trivial
to work with
processing that data requires a bit of
script and it's not there in stuff we've
done and we already have done but it's
oh it's that much more legwork to get
the benchmark is completed so we don't
do it too often Jeff Chris 47 $5 how
good of a board and your opinion is the
my screen on black it does that
sometimes it's this specific screen
they'll come back and telling drivers
okay it's back where to go how good of a
board in your opinion is the a C's
crosshair hero six extreme it's it's
perfectly fine we use it for our
standardized rise and benchmarking
couple store orders let me check that as
well that's installing drivers so like I
said purchasing from the store is one of
the best ways to support our streaming
because it's a lot of extra work to set
these up whenever we do them still doing
normal filming for the day and editing
as well but if you want to help us out
directly you go to store documents
actions done that grab something there
that you think is suitable we have
everything from $10 keychains and cheap
stickers and decals up to mod mats and
shirts like the foil graph logo shirt
I'm wearing tonight which we are running
low on stock for I think as of this
stream actually I'll check that
inventory in a second so we got an order
from Tim in Santa Cruz Santa Cruz is a
great place who picked up the graphite
zipper hoodie thank you
and one of the mugs let me check on that
inventory see what we have left
so for the foil shirts we have we've
still got a couple 3x + 4 X 2 X is gone
and we're not ever gonna get more large
is gone exhale there's still one so I'm
gonna pick that up yet there's still one
XL left of this shirt a couple of
mediums total smallest couple extra
smalls but large 2 X are gone and XL is
almost gone that's still installing the
drivers super chats so I'll check normal
chat a moment to TM $5.00 I have an 1886
case stable 5 gigahertz at one point two
four volts that's very good I can get it
to what five point three gigahertz at
one point four three but a thermal
throttle should I deal it no oh wait
8086 K yes I take that back
900 K no 88 86 K yes it's easy
be careful obviously at your own risk
all that stuff but the tools are cheap
to deal it and it is 86 K simple process
you can buy the rocket toolkit for like
30 bucks or something and it's pretty
foolproof follow the instructions
obviously but and then a liquid metal
help you out that's just like not
install no no it's let's restart it okay
so I'm going to will restart this C of
the drivers today and then I'll figure
out what we're telling next Tim $5 have
you heard trouble of anyone getting
Nvidia to responds returns but trying to
return my 2080 TI fe and have not gotten
a single email back as a matter of fact
yes someone just sent a super chat named
Tim saying that so I haven't heard too
many stories like that I've definitely
heard that enmity has been slow to get
processed returns process but I haven't
heard that they've just straight ignored
anyone so try again if it persists as a
problem let us know
yeah I don't know what's will try the
driver install one more time that this
system does not like this card more the
previous one Nestea or $5 I will be
moving to Europe and wants a
future-proof myself as much as possible
what GP direct man 2070 or 1080i or
anything else I like the 1080i at that
price class if you can find it Z money
$10 I see you love GN thank you is it
possible my 8086 K sucks yes it is
possible
can't get it stable 5 gigahertz all
cores with anything less than one point
3 5 volts is 1.25 fine for every day yes
it is fine
maybe the motherboard gigabyte gaming
SLI z3 9 8 10 + 2 PWM I the 1.35 is fine
just run 1.35 Israel Garcia $4.99 I'm
trying to find motherboards to do to
Intel 905 peer in raid 0 2 970 Evo m2
the same and 228 et is Li has a lot of
PCIe you want 9900 K or should I go x2
99 so you want for got 4 SSDs that are
on PCIe and you wanted to GPUs I say X
299 or 399 okay I'm gonna try this one
more time
this time they're gonna clean install so
DD you already happened but whatever
space birdie two dollars would a stable
CPU become unstable once GPU overclocks
not typically seveal si $4.99
what about fan benchmarks would love a
guide Oh like literal fans oh wait no
you mean like viewer fans with a love a
guide and be able to send in data so you
don't have to do the VR work guides not
good enough we need standardized tests
he needs to be the same person the
software is not easy to just turn into a
guide it's also partly in-house so yeah
you cannot not doable Israel Garcia
$1.99 any word on 128 ET i hybrids will
be available not sure I don't know if
Jake was watching the stream but if he
is Jacob feel free to send a text I
think they said like not sure okay not
sure I don't think I don't think he's
messaged it's me
Ramon $5.00 I have a restart okay that
was a good restart we want that one
I have 250 BTC with CL seller on 710 70s
when trying to use GP render on 3ds max
only three work maybe because PCIe lanes
what do I need to use as a node cheap I
am not sure what you're asking for
um I don't know if you could elaborate
that would be great I don't know what
you're asking
drivers could be an issue PCIe lanes if
they were set up like a mining system
are probably an issue with that kind of
render I don't know John Anderson 10.22
of these super chaps I need to get
through
is it gonna install it should install
this time it's trying to pop up not sure
if you saw me a message on discord was
the DX error related to DP secondary
monitor does it happen when these
secondary monitors HDMI if you mean when
we're seeing those like X DS all over
the screen as I've been calling the
artifacting does not matter if there's a
secondary monitor
and it's happening on single monitors as
well
not sure about secondary monitor with
HDMI but the newest drivers fix a lot of
secondary monitor issues last time I
read fright now Linux guy 11 2 eyes will
you ever try them on Linux probably not
it is an interesting question though but
probably not immediately
so what's chat saying I'm looking at
chat right now and I need to scroll down
a bit chat says F yep
someone says ask Autodesk for the other
question that does sound odd a desk will
probably respond to you I don't know if
they'll do it competently or not but
they'll respond without about 4G
decoding only three or so will work due
to memory mapping so there you go
someone some people are trying to answer
your question in chat thank you for
taking that up for me then really $2.99
best case for water cooling a full ATX
sighs thanks I like the 11 dynamic for
that category without any other
parameters departs the question that's
that's what I like what do you think of
Linus has modified IBM 5150 I am not
familiar with it so I have to go look do
you have a discord I can draw and we do
but it's patreon only patreon.com slash
gamers nexus for that ok it installed
but it's not showing up but it installed
try restarting I'm gonna give up after
this on this card ok read it out with
the last few stories here Matthew from
Massachusetts picked up a Raglan hoodie
thank you good timing on that again for
the cool weather lightweight hoodie if
you want one it's two-tone flu and
grayish black doubt some decals from
Brady thank you for picking those up in
the US and in order for from John in
North Carolina for a one of the actually
last one the last XL of this shirt so
large for the foil graph logo limited
shirt limited because we're not making
more once they're gone they're gone it's
large that is here oh that's done it's
not gonna be listed again XL is that
zero I think yeah it's at zero it's done
2x I think is gone so we've got some
three four
X and some small sizes see yeah so large
a zero XL is gone 2x is gone couple 3x
couple 4x couple of extra stops extra
small small and medium we have two extra
smalls some smalls and some mediums then
that'll be it
we will not be restocking this order so
thank you for picking up the last Excel
John okay it did not look like it was
successful but let me read the last
order here Scott from New York picked up
a blue print shirt thank you Scott all
right so I'm gonna have to look at this
separately it doesn't like this card
like it's just straight not detecting it
or it's not installed it is detecting it
but it's not installing the drivers
properly so it's either an OS issue or
card issue I can troubleshoot both I'm
not gonna do it today on stream so recap
will film separately but the short
version is this card I think was one of
the very bad ones I think that's the one
that nearly took the OS with it this
card with all the thermocouples that I
can't move over there is artifacting
pretty bad but thermals don't appear to
be an issue on any of the components
memory or VR admin f1 was very bad when
I was testing it earlier but we didn't
reproduce issues on the stream g1
gigabyte card had issues in fer mark but
we didn't see immediate issues in times
pi so I need to test that further over a
longer period and this one I won
exhibited issues like once and we're not
able to get it to go go again so I would
say that one's a problem as well so
there is your quick recap someone said
triodes as I have a blueprint sure it's
nice and soft glad you like it
it's basically a tooth to blend it's
it's like a 50/50 shirt so are you a
couple chats for a second just normal
chats then I'll I'll close it out so Dan
Callahan says Steve I'm fairly new to
the channel two months watching love how
informative your channel is made
upgraded my CPU much easier recently
glad to hear that
glad it helped you someone just says GTX
2060 no contacts so I'll just read that
I guess
yes fortnight that's it no context why
chat hasn't changed a bit
okay I've got two super chats I'm not
gonna read any more after these two so
we have Bell mo 831 five dollars what if
you put cards in the oven to refloat the
solder like we used to do it with a
knife 800 G x2 I am NOT going to do that
these are not my cards that would there
are a lot of things I can do that won't
violate the warranty or that no one will
ever know about that is not one of them
putting it in an oven is pretty
noticeable so I will not be doing that
but it's an interesting question I think
you will not get an answer to that
anytime soon because for most people
they can just file an RMA there within
the window they'll get a return it'll be
fine
last one Ramone $2 cancel I write down
150 how do I write to you please I think
so chat gave you a lot of answers for
your your question on multi GB or 3ds
max I don't think I can answer that I'm
not familiar with 3ds max range
requirements Autodesk's might be able to
help I don't know you can tweet at us
though okay alright so that's that's it
for this one guys I got to work on a
recap and some other content we've
filmed a few pieces today as well
hardware news and a case benchmark
that's pretty cool and thank you for
watching we'll have more on these twenty
ATT eyes pretty soon I need to do some
follow-up testing the offline not
streaming so I can really dig into stuff
and spend time on it and yeah that's it
for this one so stored on cameras axis
net as always double that directly or
pick up the last few of this shirt like
I said once it's gone that's it so we've
got 3 X 4 X a couple smallest couple
mediums and also a couple extra smalls
two of those so almost gone pick it up
on the store if you wanted thank you for
watching and subscribe for more
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
