Nexus Donna and today we're reviewing
the NZXT phantom 530 case this case uses
a very similar chassis to the Phantom
630 and H 630 both by NZXT so most of
the changes between this and the
previous reviews of those cases will be
relegated to stock cooling and cable
management space as always we'll start
with a case walkthrough before going
into any of my opinions and benchmark
data so let's jump to that the phantom
530 is a mid tower mid-range gaming case
priced at around $130 the case ships in
black white and red variants and as you
can see our review unit was a glossy red
on the outside we've got the standard
NZXT phantom aesthetic with front top
and side grills for fans and airflow of
course and the side panel features a
large ish window that'll expose the CPU
and video card but hides the dry of
scaffolding pretty well so you don't get
that ugliness in your view front I Oh
includes standard two audio ports and
two USB 3 ports the top of the case
features a three speed fan controller
that fazes power in high medium and low
settings I tested all three of these
settings in the benchmark
and I'll have that data for you in a
moment dust filters are also present in
the front intake and PSU intake sections
and internally we've got two stock fans
a 200 millimeter intake and 140
millimeter rear exhaust fan with room
for additional 200 millimeter top
mounted fans a side mounted fan and
internal directional fan that mounts to
the drive scaffolding so if you want to
point it out the video card you can do
that radiators up to 360 millimeters in
length can be fitted to the
compartmentalized radiator slot in the
top of the case but you won't have room
for a push-pull configuration without
mounting the radiator below the top
compartment so do keep that in mind if
you want to fans on your rad and
everything else is pretty standard
decent cable management pass-throughs
with appropriate cable anchors on the
rear side lots of cable routing space
behind the motherboard tray and two
lists drive bays make installation
pretty quick so very standard features
for NZXT at this point we really have
come to expect those from them as for
opinion
quite honestly it's really it's it's
nothing disappointing or spectacular
it's just right in the middle of what we
expect from NZXT what we expect for $130
the framing specs are so similar to
other current-gen phantom boxes that I
really as a reviewer I wasn't blown away
because I look at these all the time
right but don't let that take away from
the value of the case it's really got
quite solid build quality honestly on
the whole and especially at the price
and it has good cable this panel design
that makes disassembly very easy if you
want to take it apart the plastic does
kind of look cheap in the glossy red
finish I will definitely complain about
that but that's my only real complaint
for the entire product in actuality the
plastics and metals are actually pretty
they're pretty standard for mid-range
cases and will withstand many build
cycles so the quality is pretty good
especially at 130 bucks it's not like
it's kind of fall apart on you the
airflow is good and it'll do everything
you need it to do and that's exactly
what I say in the review the case does
everything it intends to do no more no
less
experienced builders will be able to get
a great system together in a couple of
minutes and Kaiba will manage it all
within 45 minutes the case facilitates
cleanliness so anyone who gets excited
about cable routing will be happy to
work with this one a rear side fan hub
does make managing additional fans a bit
easier especially when connecting them
to the front fan speed controller
definitely a nice feature if you're
loading the system with lots of fans and
want to control the noise so let's
quickly hit the benchmarks before
concluding you can read about our
testing methodology on the full review
linked in the description below along
with all of our other all my other
thoughts and opinions about the case
this is the CPU benchmark the phantom
530 performs dead center of the pack
with the high fan setting placing it
within margin of error of both the 820
and 630 on high settings this isn't too
surprising looking at the similarities
between the actual underlined chassis
underneath all of the the paneling its I
think the H 630 and phantom 630 have an
identical chassis the phantom 630 and
phantom 530 have very similar ones and
the 820 is a bit taller and skinnier
this isn't too surprising so I wouldn't
let the CPU temperatures on this case
dictate my
it's really not a limiting factor given
the average performance average isn't
bad it's not good just you know look at
your other options a bit more
extensively it's definitely not an RV
zero - but it's not bad so here's what
we've got four GPUs once again the tests
indicate pretty Center PAC performance
with nothing to complain or rave about
larger video cards will likely feature
larger Delta's between the cases and I
do think the Phantom 530 will probably
perform better with a large video card
especially if you're utilizing that
additional side or scaffold intake
overall from the build quality and ease
of installation perspectives I'm happy
with the case it's a great option for
new and experienced builders it won't
really leave you wanting a whole lot and
the closest competitors I would consider
the price range would probably be the
Thor version - Corsair C 70 and Corsair
500 are those are the closest ones I
would consider along with this one I've
linked all these in the description
below if you're curious at the end of
the day your selection will really hinge
on what sort of style and theme you're
going for with the build you're gonna be
looking at this for years so what do you
want to look at because all these cases
I've just listed and the Phantom 530 are
very solid performers I personally don't
really like the plastic --red look but
you know white and black are also
options so those seem fine that's all
for this time the full review is linked
in the description below and I will see
you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
