ish basically as far as video is
concerned day two and these are some
really nice tables that I got and used
there you line packing tables I was able
to find a good deal on a bunch of um
from my mobile phone a phone repair shop
that closed down so we're just cleaning
them off Keegan's working on building a
storage shelf right now for the kitchen
stones coming in soon to do the last
three or four wiring runs for their
production room to get those all in
10-gigabit and then we're gonna start
building these tables and i think we
have a good plan on where they're gonna
go already before that this video is
brought to you by thermal grizzlies
high-end thermal paste and liquid metal
thermal grizzlies cryo knot is an
affordable high quality thermal compound
that doesn't face some of the aging
limitations of other pastes on the
market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted tests by a tube at the link
in the description below we just have a
quick setup going with the 10 gigabit
cat 6 wire is going at the wall so this
is port 13 so we have wire join into the
system into the wall and then there's a
patch panel up here so it's coming out
of 13 and that is currently talking into
a 10 gigabit router that we already had
then this end comes out goes into the
test batch and so then the test is does
it transfer at the correct speeds
so we're just gonna Paul the dead nice
video paste it on to the ITX or micro
ATX machine so the networking we think
is all fine and it is heading the speed
just hitting 1.1 gigabytes per second
which is pretty close to 10 gigabit
almost yeah
after overhead and drive considerations
and all that so that seems that seems
good I think at this point it's just a
matter of getting the right right
systems and production systems the
faster drives so that's the wiring
that's been going on basically patch
panel up here is talking to ports in the
walls and we're gonna have a 10 gigabit
switch I want to gigabit switch and then
we'll just control which one goes to
what based on well budget obviously is
why we're gonna have one gigabit switch
and then need for each room so that's
that's the work that went on in here it
is on this splash screen we turn it on
it says that this is cat 5 and 24 gauge
at at exit cat 6 in 23 gauge 12 for just
the whole wire ok and then it's kind of
funny yeah 112 everywhere in 113 for one
wire and this just means that Saturday
matches savvy so if you did a crossover
cable I'm guessing it round really swap
those two yeah I'm guessing it rounds up
and they all very close to 113 or
something that's probably true
alright so to explain the tables
basically Pat rhetoric on tabletops that
one is face up and then the rest face
down
there's
about an inch and a half thick maple and
it's real wood that's like one of the
few things it's not particle board that
we've worked on so super nice top eight
feet long 30 inches deep and we have
five of those I bought them used with
some other stuff but the main thing is
each one I has three pairs of really
heavy-duty metal legs so they're
definitely not gonna be wobbly or
anything like that because I can't
really really mount shelves to the walls
everywhere I want to I bought these with
them and it's a power strip with the
shelf built in which is actually really
nice and like everything else it's eight
feet on I guess sir
ceilings are nine feet so yeah that
accessible from the front of the table
which will be awesome for testing
plugging stuff in without having to
crawl around stuff like that should stay
pretty management big on/off switch it's
got a it's actually a kind of like that
a PC ones so it will actually trip if
there's I think it says over I think it
does surge protection I don't know if it
does like short-circuit protection but I
want to say probably does at that bomb
look into it and then the other side is
just a shelf so these go under the
tables basically what I'm saying is
these are pretty involved to build it's
a lot of screws and they're very large
we're gonna have to build them upside
down and then flip them and they're
probably they're nearly 300 pounds after
everything's on it no I have a mallet
okay good it's working perfectly see so
there's the tables I'll show you where
they gone really quickly we already
published this to our patreon backers on
page on our college gamers Nexus they
got an early look at it but basically
we're doing one here in the background
of the main a roll set there'll be a
table in front of me they'll be table
behind me here it's one of those it's a
bit lower than the standing high tables
we'll have for a doll it's about three
inches lower it'll be fine for back not
putting stuff on and then the other ones
are gonna be mostly in the test room so
for this room basically height I
deliberated over this for like 10
minutes in the behind-the-scenes video
so we're gonna take one of these pretty
nice rolling table with top not the same
wood but looks close enough to be a
statically nice that will go in the
corner behind and you're filming right
now so that will go over there it's five
feet long same length as this one that
will put in two of the 8 foot long
tables same height same depth
similar service to 8-foot tables here
and then we'll do two of these uglier
two of these ugly your computer tables
go here and then two more of the ugly
computer tables go there I think that
fills this whole room that leaves us
with two of the packing tables both of
which will go in the production room I
guess I can show you what that
- so last two tables want to go here
this space is like eight foot eight so
it'll fit really nicely and then one
will go here and then I'm going to put
the remaining wood table or tables I
think it's gonna be one that fit next to
it so we'll have like 13 14 feet of
table space here eight there and then a
bunch of to point these tables back here
so they're not quite as deep they're six
inches shorter depth which will be nice
just to make sure we don't get too
crammed in here and also they're just
gonna be admitted stations so they're
gonna have like monitor keyboard mouse
on them whereas these ones might have
towers on them like systems so that's
the plan for the backing tables I think
that that pretty much wraps where
they're all gonna go so all we're doing
here is we basically have an assembly
line for these tables right now because
they are used so getting rid of all the
tape and adhesive and discoloration
everything and Patricks cleaning them
off with goo gone and sponges and then
I'm going in after with this stuff -
just reseal it and get it pretty so
looking pretty good these are gonna be
our work tables for the head for the
office so really happy about the quality
on these so we bought these tables from
a guy who labeled them meticulously with
individual like numbers on every part
and then I guess sold us a random
selection of those parts so the numbers
don't really match up but we do have a
great number
now we're trying to figure out how to
actually put them together
I think this rail without any flux on it
goes along like the floor part yeah the
one without the looks goes like because
I'm looking at a picture of them right
now and then this cable or whatever this
is the like reinforcing beam this goes
along the back like wall side the
proprietor of the business one the
eleska Stephen Burke wanted some more
cat6 because in one of the rooms they he
decided that they need to be more
computers working together and so we had
to go back and as with all new move ins
decisions were made to change things and
so we're going back in and adding three
additional cat6 rungs and that just
means having to pop open ceiling tiles
and I like to do that other one just
even gonna toss wire over this to a
thousand then run the wire quickly and
now I'm putting the ceiling toss backs
I'm done here except that I've got to
I've got pulled down through the edge of
the wire trough and then finish off all
these punches now go to the patch panel
now we did do some testing maybe two
days ago
guys muttering yeah but probably two
days ago to see if we'd get ten gigabit
and we got pretty darn closer than it
was in another video and so this is a
cat5e patch panel but we've got to take
all these wires run through a correct
cable pathways and then split them open
and punch now in the back of this patch
panel and the testing that says that
we're going to get close to ten gigabit
but not exactly ten two gigabit and so
what I got to do now is how to go from
here into the other room
and in the other room you'll see where
there is conduits in the wall like
there's an example that's the one bit in
that right there and so I just gotta
grab the wire come over to the top of
the firewall and drag it through and
then take the white wire which is
existing cat5 wire and pull them just
gonna chop that there and I use
electrical tape and I bond the cat5e and
the cat sticks together and I just use
the cat 5e has a pull through so I can
have two cat six wires at that outlet
there and that'll be the end of the wire
poles so from there it's all about
punching down and we have these little
jacks right here just gonna punch down
these I think we showed you these in
another video - with cat 6 you got to be
careful to pull this little wire as
possible out because you don't want to
lose bandwidth the more untwisted you
are the more frequency you lose so well
maybe that's not exactly how it works
but general idea you don't want to twist
the wires and punch down those punches
on the patch panel and we've done good
to go so we're almost done with this the
only thing that's bugging me is this
door right down here it's not flush so I
can use these here to go up and down and
then inside this one I control the depth
so that's how far this comes out from
the wall there and this is sorry this is
depth this is back and forth and this is
width so I can use all that to adjust it
and hopefully get it more like this one
so we figured out where all the parts go
the back support there and then this is
like a foot thing I guess yeah through
those shelves the ones that are going on
this foot nowaday they go above because
I know it's gonna pinch I'll organizer
on the floor right there these will go I
think those are the walls for the top
shelf
yeah it's gonna on either side yes your
scruples inside electrical shell thing
is one and then we just weird
these go yes I think they probably
reinforced the shell their supports of
some kind I don't know if there's holes
in the back well I just fished a piece
of plastic out from under here and now
I'm sticking my cabinet into the wall
now I'm using it properly stop being a
dick just finishing up these rj45 Jack's
of all Jack's RJ $40.00 for deposit
put on that patch cables these little
guys just got back with them strip them
button down
quick update everyone so this is what we
end up doing so far for the testing room
so this bench is insane this is
basically we decided this wasn't planned
decided to pull one of the 8 foot long
packing tables and use it for the
livestream set so give it enough real
estate to work on and build like have a
stream system the shelf on the bottom
underneath there can be used for the
streaming pc those of the encoding and
then all the components on top plus the
monitors whatever so that will be a
really nice streaming system their table
and then that left us with an extra one
of these we couldn't put that on the
streaming table so amount today here
we've got two of these just power strips
and shelves will be a really nice
testing station I'm thinking power
supply testing would be cool here but
realistically the Sun Minh is so big I
don't know if we'll fit in that slot if
it doesn't put it there otherwise it
goes on one of the grade tables so yeah
two of these are done for this room
actually all the tables are done we have
two more in the production room we have
one in the video room for the a roll set
so these two tables will go side-by-side
once we're done with the ethernet wiring
and all that stuff might might call
another circuit in here and get like a
20 amp or something but for now I think
we're good and I think that pretty much
recaps it for this room so and then
behind and figure out in the main area
there's the taller version of this table
so we just cruised by now it's actually
pretty good for it so yeah it gives a
lot of space for stream setup and then
the cobalt one I think will become the a
roll table and I have to figure out if I
want a table in the background now if
that said then the last thing I guess
Keegan's working on shelving unit with
Patrick so that thing is gonna have all
these cardboard bins in it they'll be
storing the small parts so small parts
storage throw paste throwing pad stuff
like that and I guess now I'll just go
ahead
just this is my my Walker I felt because
my neck hurts after building all the
tables so this is actually pretty useful
particularly for yelling at kids to get
off my parking lot I think that's right
I'm just gonna put this here on the sink
start setting up so that we have some
kind of like ability to consume food and
liquid in here while we work so fridge
comes in tomorrow storage cabinets done
for food so that's a key and both that
came together pretty well other than the
super busted hinge that we had
I got bent way out way out of shape so
we're gonna have to ask her another one
of those that right there is supposed to
be like that shipped like that so yeah
there's three closet pretty boring stuff
really I have to add liner to all this
stuff put the dish rack over the sink
and then we will have stuff we can
actually eat off of although they don't
presently have chairs for this room they
are three chairs in this place in total
right now so that's the update you get
back to work on the kitchen thing
alright so it's the end of technically
day - as far as video is concerned and I
guess I'll show this first this is our
newest creation it has some pretty
severe torsional force characteristics
not quite sure why he acts like that
this is from Uline quality products I
think we're just gonna run some boards
or something down the back and both
those and that should fix that problem
so we got that done this is gonna be a
bench shelf has like just corrugated
bins you pull them out like that and
it'll store throw up a sternal pads
things of that nature small small
testing parts fan controllers basically
small things we need access to for
testing and that'll go kind of here
we'll have a table here not sure which
one but table there set table for the
live stream is done so this was a
last-minute change we were expecting to
use this table for the live stream set
and the Kobalt table will get pushed
that way and used for the main set one
more workbench the background of the
live stream is that not sure if we'll do
a table for the background of the main
set oh yeah that's this table for the
ice table and we took the extra power
bar for this one and put it on stacked
in this room so this thing is just
insane it's it's probably gonna be the
the go-to test bench for any serious
testing mentioned earlier not sure if
it's in the video I mentioned earlier
might trying to put the power supply
testing here it just depends on if it'll
fit or not and we move this one into
place can't move the others into place
yet because we're still wiring that you
could have converging on all the cat6 so
stone had some progress there should be
in the video but yeah these two will go
next to each other would be an amazing
workspace so if you want to just big
continuous wooden work surface with
power in mind big bottle switches resets
for the protective circuits so we should
be good there one of the rolling wood
tables will go over there and then the
other fourth where andrew is right now
patrick has adorns the livestreams met
with one of the mod mats we brought it
over
so one thing we were considering doing
is putting the live streaming like
encoding computer down there on that
shelf so that'll actually kind of nice
as well just bit at all in one area
she's in a live stream probably this
room I doesn't have much progress or any
progress really today still it's five
shells we need to put in the sixth here
seventh over there over there and stones
got a lot of this pre-wiring done so
this is all running into all the rooms
is our new cat six wiring we're
upgrading the space from cat5 cat5e so
we're gonna do ten gigabit internally
and some of the old stuffs been pulled
off here but some of it remains internet
from outside waiting to be activated and
then we moved these two tables in as
well so this is the production room
we'll have one we'll go from here back
and then another one where I
understanding right now right there and
that'll be two of the main tables of one
of the rolling wood tables right here
and then some of the small tables two
foot deep tables coming in from Amazon
and eventually we'll go down to this
wall here I think we'll have space for
one more but now I wanna build those for
us and see the garbage or not and I
think that's most of it so that's our
progress for today I'm also ordering a
bunch of sound treatment and a whole lot
of other stuff so we're gonna do a blue
and black checkered pattern sound
treatment on the opposite side of this
wall so it's just absorption not
diffusion and that'll be used for
opposing the video sets so the echo and
reverb have both reduced significantly
since we started here this room is the
worst right now because at least stuff
in it but the main room has gotten way
better so I think with sound treatment
on the wall we should be good so yeah
that's the update that Sunday - got a
lot more work to do eventually moving
equipment in but as soon as a seadoo net
wiring is done we can start moving the
tables into place and really get going
on the rest of it gotta paint the walls
up with a set stuff like that but we're
getting there so as always thank you for
watching subscribe for more go to
patreon.com/scishow nexus for some
behind-the-scenes updates on the space
we've posted two already at the time of
this video
and go to store documents Isis net to
pick up the mod mat featured in this
video or my shirt not literally my shirt
but one of these shirts will be on the
store subscribe for more
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
