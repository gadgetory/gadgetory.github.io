dotnet and this is our benchmark of call
of duty black ops 3 which is a fairly
intensive single-player and multiplayer
game of course FPS as you all know very
well so we benchmarked cod black ops 3
on various video cards we had several
configurations more than 10 actually and
we also tested a few other things like
memory consumption sort of loose testing
there and vram consumption so all of
that is contained in the article linked
in the description below but we have
some of it here especially the core
elements and a recap of the benchmark
performance at 1080 1440 and 4k using
various settings within the game there
aren't too many settings in the game and
most of them are already understood or
defined that our other guides but the
one setting to pay attention to here is
filmic SMAA which is an anti-aliasing
technology that applies temporarily so
it's similar in concept in that way to
something like Nvidia's TX AAA with
filmic SMAA the idea comes from film
film it and that is to create a more
cinematic gaming experience in the minds
of those who implement filmic asmaa so
what does it do well it looks at the
previous frames the current frame and
other frames temporally so it looks at
everything around what you're currently
processing and it determines how the
pixels should be filtered and how the
anti-aliasing should be applied in the
next frames so this reduces the pixel
marching effect you get sometimes in
games like with jagged edges and things
of that nature with movement and dynamic
elements and is something that is
generally recommended on but it does
impact performance a bit so we did some
loose performance testing on filmic SMAA
before getting into our GPU benchmarks
because we didn't want to run our full
suite of cards without understanding how
it impacts performance the findings are
generally that filmic SMAA creates a hit
to performance of about six point five
percent so you get six point five
percent lower frame rate on average but
with some cards like the gtx 960 which
is a lower end card and other lower end
cards the performance hit grows so it's
more to the tune of ten or twelve
percent
on your other settings and the
resolution and things like that we left
this on for a lot of our tests but we
disabled it for some and you will find
that information in the article but in
general any test that is marked extra
that's what called duty calls ultra is
going to have SMAA enabled except for in
the case of the SLI configuration
because with call duty you actually
can't enable some of the anti-aliasing
technologies with SLI because it creates
too much for performance it so this is
actually disabled in the game it cannot
be enabled through the games menu so we
tested with and without it talking about
test methodology for a bit before we
jump into the benchmarks Call of Duty
has some unique challenges we face for
benchmarking in order to produce a
trustworthy benchmark for this game we
had to spend several hours checking FPS
vram consumption memory consumption and
stability in various regions of the game
we tested freerunning which is a mode we
test the first campaign level
multiplayer with and without players
present and the ready room i'll call it
and we found that cogs single-player and
multiplayer performance metrics are
separated by a vast delta with single
player outputting about thirty eight
point six percent lower frame rate than
multiplayer in some instances we
ultimately decided to run our benchmarks
in a custom multiplayer course already
uploaded to the channel but shown again
here as we figure this is what most cod
players are probably interested in if
you're into the single-player just
subtract about thirty eight percent of
the performance from these results to
get your worst case expectation of
single-player FPS that is what the first
level puts you through it's fairly
intensive what you've been looking at a
little bit is the benchmark course it's
conducted on redwood this was a 30
second test run that was executed three
times for parody on each card and we
found that the redwood map provided some
of the most intensive graphics elements
in the game and decided to use that as
our benchmark you can find the full
bench specs in the chart on the website
if you're interested in the CPU the RAM
and all of that let's get right into
this once we move to sli testing at 4k
we observed severe frame drops that
seemed to uncharacteristic of the
graphics hardware used for testing to
further analysis we ran resource
monitoring tools including res mon and
check system memory usage and this is
what we found so you can see at the
hydrographic settings at 4k black ops 3
had committed 15.2 gigabytes of ram out
of our total 32 gigabyte capacity and
this was with a working set of six point
seven gigabytes that six point seven
gigabytes working set accounts for the
physical memory consumption without page
fault and the 15.2 number represents the
virtual memory consumption or the page
will address space and this isn't much
better at other setting levels but it is
a bit better we saw closer to 11
gigabytes commit size during some of our
1080p tests and either way it's clear
that safety dictates and eight gigabyte
physical memory allowance for black ops
sort of at a minimum and you might want
more than that depending on your
settings needs we saw a full saturation
of the GPS on card memory also called
vram when running 4k and Max on a 980 TI
so that's six gigabytes of vram that was
being tapped into actively for 4k at
Ultra and it was also utilized at the
slightly lower resolution so it is a
fairly memory consumption happy game in
that regard looking at black ops 3 at 4k
and extra which is call of duty is ultra
equivalent there's no surprise that 4k
is intensive and effectively a fantasy
to play it's basically opting into
multiple high on GPUs just to be able to
play 4k with call of duty's higher
settings so that's a thirteen hundred
dollar purchase for just getting the
game up and running at a playable FPS
with 4k lower settings would make it
more doable but it may just be better to
dip to 1440p for this one check the
article for more information on this at
1440p which is the heir apparent to
1080p we saw that 1440p proves demanding
enough that anything shy of a gtx 970 or
r9 390 which is not present on these
charts because we have the send it back
would require lower settings to meet
2560 x 1440 of for the screen resolution
the r9 290x could achieve
a higher framerate with some tuning like
dropping settings down to medium but
it's not much use at 1440p and max as
for the test everyone cares about here
the 1080p extra which again equivalent
to ultra benchmark is likely at most you
are seeking running black ops 3 at 1080p
max settings we see the sli gtx 980 TI
is unsurprisingly leading by large
margins but keep in mind that you can't
enable filmic SMAA for the 980 I so that
is actually contributing to its
performance gain the one percent and
point one percent low times of the SLI
configuration fronts a larger disparity
against its average than other cards but
it brushes it aside with raw FPS output
moving to more reasonable configurations
we see the single 980 TI reference
running at 133 average with tight low
percent timings and the r9 390 exit lags
behind the gtx 980 non ti a little bit
both cards are from MSI but also remains
a cheaper card by seventy dollars the
GTX 970 tags along behind the r9 390 X
but struggles a little more with its
point one percent low FPS and notably
for andy the r9 390 x did present
impressively tight timings on the one
percent and point one percent low
metrics it's not until you drop two gtx
950 or thereabout that the FPS falls
below 60 owners of the 952 270x on the
r7 370 which is not present on the bench
and the gtx 750ti will be forced to
lower settings note that the 285 was
removed from our 1080p bench as it
encounters issues which produce
unplayable frame rates and we're
researching the root cause of this in an
attempt to determine whether it's a
problem with black ops or the AMD driver
but for now we've just removed the 285
from the 1080p benchmark here's the
chart showing medium settings with a a
disabled if you own a lower end card and
you can find more information on this
one on the website that's all for our
call of duty black ops 3 GPU benchmark
check the website for more information
and we're going to be looking at this
for other components as well like the
CPUs that we have and RAM but overall
for GPU purposes it looks like you're
going to want somewhere in the range of
a 960 or 380
if you're playing at more conservative
settings and if you're playing at higher
settings it's good as always to look
toward the 970 and the r9 390 depending
on how high you want to go with the
settings and you can check our charts as
a reference for where you need to be
there and again the article does make
more conclusions on specific GPUs if you
want to figure out more precisely what
you should buy based on our
recommendations so as always thanks for
watching it hit the patreon link in the
postural video if you want to support us
making more content like this very time
consuming but it's a lot of fun so
that's all for the black ops 3 benchmark
I will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
