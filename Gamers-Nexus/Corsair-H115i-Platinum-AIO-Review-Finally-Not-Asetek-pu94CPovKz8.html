the closed-loop liquid cooler market for
PC hardware easily holding majority
placements and all CLC sold in the u.s.
cool it has been a long contender of ASA
tax with the two having battled legally
over a Stax patent on the pump and block
design and it's also been one of course
here's to liquid cooling partners both
ASA tech and cool it make Corsair liquid
coolers though the latter fell out of
popularity for a number of years finally
with the Platinum line coursers working
again with Kula and a mainstream product
the H 115 I plateau muses a new pump and
block design and that's something we'll
show off thoroughly in our upcoming
liquid cooler internals comparison video
so subscribe to catch that for today
we're focusing on reviewing the $160 h
115 I plant them for thermals acoustics
and overall value at the price point
before that this video is brought to you
by be quiet and it's straight power 11
series power supplies the straight power
11 PSU is shipped from 450 Watts up to a
thousand watts accommodating most of the
gaming PC build requirements you'd
encounter and focuses on delivering a
higher quality power supply that doesn't
sacrifice on efficiency or stability
noise is also a heavy point for the
straight power 11 using a 135
millimeters silent wins 3 fan that can
spin as low as 200 rpm for quieter low
load operation learn more at the link in
the description below courser has a lot
of h1 15s these days there are at least
3 of them so quick recap on those the H
115 I Pro is an ace attack made cooler
the H 115 i Platinum is the new coolant
cooler that's this one that we're
reviewing today the H 115 I original was
also a Sutekh but is basically
impossible to find these days so the
difference is then the H 115 I Pro is an
ASA tech Gen 6 pump the ACE tech Gen 6
pump is something we've disassembled in
the past and showing the differences
between gen 4.5 gen five to ten for Gen
4.5 and generation 5 all three of those
aced attack pumps are pretty similar
they all have a plastic impeller it's
the yellow yellow impeller with three
prongs on it they all have very similar
internal housing very similar water
pathway
and the real difference between John 5
and John 6 or Gen 4 in Gen 6 isn't
performance but it's theoretically
permeation the impeller on Gen 6 was
improved it's a metal impeller the in
theory the permeation in hot spots
within that cooler housing has been
reduced so now there's less of a chance
of liquid permeating things like the
hottest points and the tubes or in the
barbs or whatever and that's been the
main problem with any closed liquid
cooler is over time you do naturally
lose liquid that's just what happens and
it gets replaced eventually with air and
that's what you want to avoid so Gen 5
and Gen 6 in terms of thermal
performance they're about the same
technically speaking generation 4.5
especially but Gen 5 to some degree
they're both a bit better than Gen 6 ASA
tech pumps for thermals but the internal
design for things like endurance should
theoretically favor gem 6 Gen 6 also
gives a bit more control to the through
software to what the pumps doing and
when and some more fans B controls it
can do control based on other
temperatures instead of just liquid
temperatures so if you want to change
the pump speed as long as the
manufacturer allows it you could
theoretically modulate the pump speed
based upon something other than liquid
temperature which is good because that's
kind of a dumb thing to modulate your
pump speed based on so anyway those are
the differences between those the H 115
I moved to Gen 6 it's otherwise none
exciting from the H 115 I the original
that is the original was pretty good if
you ever saw a V 2 like an H 100 IV 2
that V 2 was a demarcation made because
there was a radiator change due to an
intellectual property conflict of the
original radiator and we don't know the
specifics on that but that's that's
about what we know so that's the line
hub of course there's 115 Series coolers
the H 115 I Platinum this one today
we're gonna be opening this up in a
separate video and we'll show you in
great detail the difference between this
and the ACE attack made coolers this is
kind of exciting because ace tech makes
almost all of the coolers you see in the
US market this is because ASA tech has a
patent that more or less says if you
have a pump in the block then we own the
design and
aisa Tech has successfully gone all the
way through court like not a settlement
but actually went through court with a
judge ruling against Coolermaster that
ASA Tax patent was valid and that
Coolermaster had to stop some on its
side on Ceres effective immediately that
went all the way through the process so
a stack by nature of this legal
chokehold does manage to hold most of
the market and make most of the coolers
which is rather unexcited from a product
standpoint because EVGA corsair NZXT
doesn't matter any of them put a new
cooler out with asa tech made pump and a
tech sourced radiator they're pretty
much the same the differences come down
to how good's the pan what's the price
and what's the RGB difference NZXT made
a custom PCB for the RGB x' and that's
kind of the difference you get from them
so there's your basics now other than
this we'll talk about kind of some
software issues in the end we'll talk
about the installation things like that
on the end of the review let's first get
into the thermal testing and the
acoustic performance our thermal testing
for closed-loop liquid coolers is
specially designed what we do here is we
test the ability to soak the temperature
over time because it is liquid and
liquid does have tremendous ability to
just soak a lot of heat especially from
rapid fluctuations in temperature on the
device being cooled which is a cpu here
and so for that we're averaging over a
period a test period of about 15-20
minutes and the test period itself is a
little over 30 minutes long and that
gives us the steady-state CPU
temperatures we want to hit to make
those measurements and then we average
against some spikes we have implemented
into our tests to see how well the
soaking power is for each cooler so
let's start with some benchmarks and
then we'll talk about if this thing's
actually any good and worth 160 dollars
let's start testing with just the h1 59
platinum on the charts then we'll add a
bunch of competitive analysis with other
liquid coolers for just the h1 59
platinum we changed pump speeds and fan
speeds benchmark performance stock with
full pump and fan speed we measured
performance as hitting 35 degrees
Celsius over ambient on our standardized
test bed idle was about 6.5 degrees over
ambient
setting the pump speed to balanced and
leaving the fan speed to fall we saw an
increase of two degrees Celsius and load
temperatures versus the baseline full
speed because it balanced is dependant a
bomb liquid temperature and fluctuates
based on it
silent ended up with these same results
we'd really have to strain balanced
harder in order to show the differences
in theory it should prove more useful
when bouncing between idle loads and
heavy loads more rapidly in a thermally
constrained case but that's not the test
scenario we have set up for our test
bench balance ran about the same 2,000
to 2,400 rpm range as silent mode did
and so the results are functionally the
same set to a noise normalized 40 DBA
thermals climbs to 41 degrees over
ambient for an increase of about 6
degrees over stock we next tested with a
repast using our standard a synthetic
compound finding almost zero change
between the two results we're within
plus or minus 1 degrees Celsius margin
of error at thirty nine point six
degrees versus 41 degrees so it's it's
very close the more important thing here
is that the stock Kulik compound spread
is actually sufficient to cover the x99
cpu this isn't true on most of the
preinstalled pastes on the ACE attack
coolers where they primarily cover LGA
1150 P use but don't really give full
coverage on h EDT cpus this fuller
spread across nearly the entire IHS is
one of the biggest improvements in the
new cooler and it's something that cool
IT did well to improve over asa tax with
widespread design it's not a big change
from what a stack does but it's a small
one and one which is noticeable and
something that from an attention to
detail standpoint is a major improvement
just because it's been a problem for so
on on the asa that coolers the next test
is noise normalized for 40 DBA where
each cooler has a noise budget up to 40
DBA at 20 inch distance for measurement
in a room with a noise floor of about 26
dB this allows us to see which cooler
has the most efficient performance and
the trouble with maximum speed
benchmarks is that they aren't really
comparable as some fans might run at two
times the speed of others and produce
more noise in the process making them
not really fair to compare against each
other this test fixes that problem it
sets the noise level to 40 DBA so we
were controlling for noise to get a
compare
thermal results and again that
measurements at 20 inches away at 40 DBA
with our controlled paste applied the H
150 and I platinum ends up at thirty
nine point six degrees over ambiens
which has it functionally tied with the
ek fluid Gaming 240 and other coarser H
159 models
note that the pro the H 115 I Pro capped
out at 37 DBA due to fan speed
limitations so it is slightly better
here but much more limited in the
maximum performance potential something
we'll see elsewhere the fluid gaming is
a budget class open-loop and has much
more water present as it has a
standalone reservoir and a separate pump
entirely so it doesn't really count as a
fair comparison but it's on there
nonetheless the H 115 i Platinum is
within reasonable margin of error of the
other age 115 models and though it was
slightly warmer than it given the
variables involved in testing we are at
the limits of test resolution for these
coolers that are all kind of within one
to two degrees of each other the H 115 i
Platinum does prove better than the H
100 IV to to no one's surprise and
better than the be quiet silent loop 280
or close to error margins anyway the
three sixty millimeter coolers like NZXT
T's kraken X 72 and coarser zone H 150 I
outperformed the H 115 i platinum by way
of having more fans and a larger
radiator when fixed through this noise
level this is where those larger coolers
really start to excel because they have
more fans they have a bigger radiator
and they have more liquid they can get
away with lower noise while sustaining a
lower or at least equal temperature
which is really the biggest benefit the
cost difference is also present of
course
so while normalize that 40 DBA and with
stock fans to keep cost controlled the H
159 Platinum ends up about two to three
degrees warmer than the H 150 I at 40
DBA for most people the 280 millimeter
CLC performs well enough and that 2
degree difference may never be
noticeable now you could reduce the
noise level further on the larger
coolers and still sustain equal noise to
the 280 core so that's really the magic
in it is you can start dropping the RPMs
you can drop maybe 238 DB a 37 DBA and
still equal performance of a 280 that
runs into limitations of the cooling
solution as a whole
and the fact the fan countin fan size
for the fuller chart now the H 159 Platt
and I'm at maximum pump and fan speed
puts it at 35 degrees Celsius over
ambient which has it functionally tied
with the EVGA CLC 240 at its maximum RPM
of 2500 this difference is the result of
EVGA is aggressive fans which hit fifty
eight point one DBA really loud to
course there's forty nine point one DBA
on the Platinum at max speed fifty eight
point one just for reference puts it as
a nearing something like a reference
blower cooler on an AMD GPU it's
terribly loud you would want to tune
these down to be quieter because it's
just unbearable to sit next to you
but if you only want to performance well
it runs pretty fast
the to achieve the same thermal result
ultimately but Corsairs achievement is
done at a much lower noise level at
forty nine verses 58 DBA
you're looking at a perceivable to the
human ear noise level difference of
about 2x the one hundred sixty dollar
price point is more expensive than EVGA
as $100 CLC 240 but the extra radiator
and fan size do benefit the noise levels
significantly and account for that price
plus there's more RGB if that's
something you really care about more
fairly compared the H 115 i platinum
also competes closely with NZXT he's
crackin X 62 also heavily RGB focused
which has performance within our error
margins it's also near the H 150 eyes
35.5 degrees alt equipped with slower
fans and not distant from the original H
115 IV two at 1500 rpm ranking thirty
five point eight degrees Celsius over
ambient for noise levels at twenty inch
distance the H 115 I platinum ends up at
forty nine point one DBA when at 17:30
rpm forty DBA when at 1200 rpm and about
thirty five point eight DBA when at
fifty percent speed or about 900 rpm
comparatively the NZXT crackin next six
two peaks at about fifty one point five
DBA when at 1700 rpm Corsair falls
within the expected noise range for a
cooler with this fan rpm and this is the
max rpm it's about 1730 on each so one
thing that you might have noticed the H
115 I pro the Gen 6 ASA tech one is more
limited in top-end performance than the
H 159 Platinum that's because the pro
had more limited fan speeds they were
not as effective in cool and as the
platen
fans that spin faster and so your
limitation is sort of artificial if you
move the fans around between them they
will end up roughly within margin of
error of each other all other things
controlled but when you're spending 160
bucks on the cooler
you probably don't really want to go out
and then spend another 20 to 40 dollars
on fans because that just seems sort of
stupid so what we end up with is a
product that is fine like most liquid
coolers that are 160 dollars it's not
exceptional in any performance measure
these things are all pretty much within
a couple degrees of each other often
within margin of error of their
predecessors or of their direct
competitors and so that leaves you
picking based on price and based on
looks and based on maybe if you feel
like you can keep the fans or not this
is clearly heavily RGB marketed it
literally has the the letters RGB in the
name so if you don't care about that
definitely buy something cheaper the
EVGA CLC 280 has long been a good
performer it can be tuned and reasonably
well because the fan speed does have
some range in there to play with and if
you just want performance and you don't
care about anything else
to 80 millimeter radiators are still
pretty much the sweet spot for liquid
cooling in a closed loop we would still
recommend to 80s they're often cheaper
than 360s they perform similarly you can
get better noise to thermal performance
than a 240 and they make a lot of sense
the EVGA CLC 280 is a great choice if
you don't care at all about RGB LEDs
EVGA is RGB LEDs are unimaginative
uninspiring and boring and if that's
what you want and you're cooler then
it's a good product from a strict
thermal standpoint this one is more
about looks and will leave you to decide
if you like the RGB LEDs on it if it's
if you are looking for LEDs well of
course there's one of the main companies
that go it because they've gone kind of
insane with LEDs and putting them on
everything so they do have a good
arguments to make there for the product
and that leg of the market now software
10 you some improvement IQ has gotten a
lot of advancements over the iterations
especially over previous versions of
Corsair software so it's much improved
but we still had this cooler drop out of
software every now and then so three
times during testing we actually won
was completely invalid we had to throw
away the data and rerun it and that was
because the software stopped detecting
the product or at least stopped
interfacing with it so it showed that h1
59 platinum in software and when you
tried to control the pump speed through
it it actually no longer applied and it
still held the old settings that were
applied before this sort of firmware
crash or whatever happened that caused
the cooler to fall out of communication
with the software so that is an issue
that we hope to see improved now you can
patch the firmware we try to do it's all
the way up to date so that was not an
issue but it seems to be a software
issue where it just it just drops out of
communication and that's really annoying
so we're not sure why that happens but
it did happen a couple of times and then
software in general it is certainly
better than in the past it's not as
resource intensive as cam it's not as
kind of creepy as cam is but it is also
still annoying to use software to
control liquid cooling products but you
don't have to do it it does make it
easier though the radiator bracket
screws for this thing are really not
deep enough or it needs a pad to screw
into behind it so the screws included
with the cooler are long enough that
they can go through something like maybe
a one millimeter or so thick piece of
steel if you're going through a case or
you're going through an L bracket like
we are and it can go through that and
then it still goes into the bracket for
the radiator and it's still got extra
length where you're just you're either
gonna drive it into a fin which is fine
it doesn't hurt anything or ideally
drive it into a pad and so what courser
could do to improve here is make the
radiator bracket spaced out from the
radiator itself a little bit more like
half a millimeter maybe would do it
extra or make put a pad in there behind
the hole that you screw into just like
on some of the other cooling products
out there so does it hurt it no because
the tube with the liquid isn't behind
the screw so that's that's great
coolermaster screwed that up in the past
and it results in leaking coarser got it
right but they could still do much
better and that's by having more spacing
for those for the bracket verses the
radiator itself so that could be
improved the radiator fan screws are
pretty
as well we ended up using a couple of
washers to just make sure they didn't
penetrate too far into the radiator and
the cable design is really sort of
annoying so all these coolers have the
same problem where they have their
becoming an octopus oh just a ton of
cables sticking out of the block which
is unfortunate because that's where you
need the most cable management is right
in the middle of the computer but you
can kind of manage so the cable design
has the SATA cable for power and the
pump TAC in the same bundle and what you
can do is you just pull them apart so
it's not terrible
they're just wire cables stalled glued
together you just pull them apart and
it's fine but still we would like to see
either separate cables or well separate
cables is the best approach because then
you can remove the ones that you really
don't need and that's something that
could be improved cable management is is
a consideration here for course art to
improve in the future there was recently
a recall of the h1 15i Platinum RGB s
eversion the white version about one
percent of customers were affected it
was a specific lot number so keep that
in mind as well there has not been a
recall on the greater whole of the units
but on about 1% of them there was a
recall that bothers you then obviously
you might want to consider it your
buying process if you feel like it was
just what it probably was which is a
limited manufacturing quality control
issue then we can probably move on from
the issue but this was a matter of the
liquid leaking into and out of the
tubing so it leaked into the tubing and
it's bright green you'll notice it right
away if there's an issue but yep that's
that was a consideration so really what
you're buying this for is the lights and
we'll give Corsair a lot of credit there
Corsair has done well with their RGB
LEDs they really have they've invested a
lot in it there are really good
engineers at Corsair who are working on
making things RGB illuminated and that
seems to be about where the company is
focusing right now so if that's what you
want well this cooler may well deliver
and you can decide based on how it looks
in our b-roll if you care about thermals
they're all about the same so plus or
minus a couple degrees how much that
really matter is kind of kind of a
toss-up you can run some of the coolers
a little bit quieter and get equal
thorough performance to this one you buy
better fans whatever there's a lot of
things you could do but the thing you
shouldn't do is buy this cooler strictly
because you want good thermals because
if that's all you care about there are a
lot of options on the market CLC - ATS
cheap and CFCs crack in X 62 is good but
again expensive for the looks aspect
there are plenty of others - and we've
got them all in our charts so that's it
for this one overall what do we think
well it's got some flaws like for
example the radiator depth of that
bracket it's got flaws with cable
management could be improved none of
these things are product braking so
they're really not big deals it's just
it's small stuff we'd like to see
improve but it's nothing that completely
ruins the product product is perfectly
fine overall and we will look at it in a
much greater depth in our next video so
