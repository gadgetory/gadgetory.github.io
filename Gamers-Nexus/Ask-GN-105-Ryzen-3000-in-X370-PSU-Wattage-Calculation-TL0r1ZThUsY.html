been a little while for these so this is
a community questions than answers
segments you can leave your questions in
the comment section below we also have
some from our patreon backers on discord
and there will also be a second ask GN
going to the public Channel so we're
doing two of these from public release
over the next day or so and then there's
a patreon ask patreon patrons the
looking for patrons ask G n that will be
available via at this court or the
patreon group for anyone who wants to
watch that separate episode with a with
just some extra fun questions from
discord so getting into this one oh I
should also note the second public asked
young one we're doing will hopefully
feature snowflake I think so check back
for that I want to try and film the
intro at the home studio for that before
that this video is brought to you by the
gigabyte zi 390 ARS master motherboard
which comes equipped with one of the
more powerful zi 390 VRMs for heavier
overclocks on the new 9th Gen Intel CPUs
the ARS master is also one of the few
motherboards with a really heatsink this
generation featuring a mix of high
surface area fins and looks oriented
hover blocks oh and it's also got
updated our DV illumination
learn more at the link below alright so
as always the format for these were
going into I don't know a hundred and
fifth
that so format for these is leave your
questions below and I'll do my best to
get to them and I might have to pitch
them to people who know more than I do
depend on how hard they are so also I'll
just note these are still sort of in
stock so if you want one they're on
store like humans axis done that but all
right first question is from ultimate
fate who said why are the GT 10:30 gtx
950 and 1050 TI manufactured using a 14
nanometer processor is the 16 animated
FinFET process used for the rest of the
pascal cards how did anybody have it
lower end cards manufactured using the
smaller process and why were the other
cards that not manufactured using the
smaller dode so the process size doesn't
small process i their process no it
doesn't just mean it's better as a first
note
Nvidia
it does not give a great answer on this
question if you ask officially their
responses something to the tune of we
believe all of our manufacturing
partners are great and all of these
process nodes are excellent choices for
our GPS and our gamers so not
particularly helpful my understanding is
that the switch between different
different solutions providers for
silicon manufacturing by Nvidia TSMC or
otherwise is really just to spread the
load so that's that's kind of how I
understand it is it's a a means of
ensuring that there's a constant supply
of GPUs and that they're not putting too
much too much strain on one source and
it also allows to in theory provide some
additional negotiation leverage when
negotiating prices for the silicon parts
that come out of the fabulous Nvidia is
fabolous so that's why my understanding
as for technical differences I mean it's
just I don't think there are any
meaningful differences in a way that you
would you would see the manifest in
performance or in the capabilities of
the cards at least that's that's that's
how that's how I was how I was told when
I asked this question to a few people in
the industry so yeah my understanding is
really just it's to spread the
manufacturing load and to get multiple
sources just just like they do for
memory they get hynek's micron Samsung
memory whatever they can get to put on
the cards and sometimes some is a bit
better than others but it all fits the
spec so but back to the the question of
node sizes I'll just note that things
like like density do matter as well the
definition that matters so AMD for it an
easy example and these seven nanometer
is similar to intel's ten nanometer in
actuality and well assuming intel ever
you know makes it but it just it comes
down to again density definition who's
making it what is their technology so
not necessarily as simple as like you
get 40 nanometer over here in 16 over
here 14 sweater than 16 next question
we're gonna have a couple of hard cuts
on this one because I'm still
kind of safe so next was from dar he
says new motherboards often come with
one or more thermocouples Oh
thermocouples which motherboard
component or installed device would you
choose to monitor great question so yes
some of the high-end ACS boards do come
with thermocouples I don't think too
many boards come with them but certainly
the high end overclocking ones do the
problem is that typically those
thermocouples are like the fatter kind
so the you can get kind of two types of
thermocouples you get the flat film kind
which is really good it's they're
expensive as heck to buy but but they're
very good you can sandwich them between
just about anything doesn't really
impact thermal performance your
measurements will be accurate down to
fractions of a degree and the resolution
is often like 0.1 degrees Celsius or
something like that so those are really
good and that's what we use for for
example if you want to sandwich them
between small SMDs and a pad or
something but the problem is the ones
that come with the motherboards have
their I can't remember exactly they have
like a bulb and so it's a bit thicker
and round so you can use them for sure
to some degree of accuracy but the
problem is you can't really like
sandwich it between a MOSFET and a pad
because the the end of the thermocouple
where the measurement is actually taken
is not touching the MOSFET directly in
that scenario it's probably sort of
floating up in the pad or in the air
with the bottom side of it touching the
MOSFET so you're not gonna get the most
accurate reading that way which is
unfortunate but also it is now creating
a height gap between the device and its
heatsink which could pose issues with
mounting you could crush the
thermocouple when you tighten the
heatsink or you might not tighten it
enough and there's not good thermal
contact the results are meaningless
stuff like that so if you get a board
with a flat thermocouple properly flat
like what are they like 1/100 of an inch
thick typically for the good ones then I
would put it on a hotspot MOSFET which
you can determine by kind of I mean
ideally you measure them but for all
intents and purposes
for consumer use it's about the same to
just kind of look at it and then you
know count the MOSFETs and pick the one
in the middle
assuming they're all vcore and if it's
not be corn there's one that's like GT
over on the end that ignore that one so
yeah that's how I would do it I would
pick a hot spot like central MOSFET
that's sandwiched between some inductors
because those are really hot there's
some capacitors maybe is in poor areas
through couples which they often are
then I guess my choice would be if I'm
doing an open loop maybe I'd stick one
of the reservoir just to get a liquid
temperature that's really useful kind of
interesting to look at so that's a good
choice for you you could you kinda you
could shove one between maybe if it's
tight enough in between a MOSFET and an
inductor as opposed to on top of one of
them because then you're not going to
cause a height gap issue and you can
just kind of get an ad-hoc measurement
of between two really hot things and
make sure they're not crazy that doesn't
tell you anything useful sort of but I
mean it's you'll know if they're too hot
and up to until that point it's maybe
not the most useful measurement but
could be fun to look at other places you
could stick one I mean if you think
there's like if you have concerns of I
don't know heat with your GPS now you
have multiple GPUs or sandals together
maybe you have an m2 SSD under there or
something like that for the most part
you can look at software measurements
for all of these devices but if not for
some reason then I would consider a
thermocouple down between the GPUs or
maybe under where the SSD is because
that's gonna be a really hot area that's
sandwiched between a bunch of things and
one more option here that's actually
pretty practical is just a case ambient
thermocouple you just kind of it won't
be great for Kayla man ahead but I just
kind of tie it somewhere like on a hard
drive cage or somewhere that's between
the the CPU intake fan in the front of
the case or if there's a water block in
the water block in the front of the case
between your intake and where they're
supposed to go basically consider just
mounting one kind of in the case
floating an air
and that'll give you an error an ambient
temperature in the case so if you know
your external ambience 21 degrees and
you see your case is 40 well there's
plenty of room to improve your your case
airflow so that's another really good
and practical place to put one hopefully
those give you some ideas
they're not all that helpful for
everyday use but they're definitely fun
to use thermocouples it gives you some
more measurements you don't normally get
otherwise these are typically for high
end overclocking scenarios they can be
used to insert into the the through-hole
in the socket sometimes there's one of
those and high on board so you can get a
socket temperature I would say you can
use them for like a dry eye spot or
Allen to pot or something like that but
you probably want to use something
better for that better insulated better
better build hopefully those could be
ideas though great question if you have
any more like that please ask them lots
of fun to work with those types of
questions
next one human person says yes I'm sure
you are that you are not a robot or an
alien at all human person what PSU
wattage is reasonable do I just add the
TDP of all my components and then take
double or something like that
really good question this is a pretty
sort of basic one but also one that's
important to answer and and is I'm not
particularly well documented so power
supply wattage what's reasonable I
wouldn't just add the TDP so I wouldn't
take like like my GP is 250 my CPUs 90
I wouldn't then call that 340 44 for the
power supply requirement at that point I
would I would here's what I would do I
would go to reviews and look up like the
the actual power consumption tests these
are kind of tricky I'll tell you why in
a moment but look at power consumption
tasks between hopefully us we might have
some an attack normally does a good job
of them PC / in the past it's done a
good job with them and there's plenty
others out there too so I would check
different reviews for the power
consumption of the components you're
using now here's the the trap you need
to avoid a lot of the time we reviewers
will use total system power consumption
for our benchmarks and what you're
really looking at is kind of a delta
there so if if device a consumes
air quotes around that 500 watts on this
chart imaginary chart and device B
consume 600 watts ultimately the
difference is 100 watts and assuming the
test platform itself is controlled
properly and I know we control eros
properly and I'm sure other reviewers do
theirs as well then that's a reliable
means to determine the difference
relative of the two devices so you
really look at a relative difference not
necessarily an absolute difference
because unless you know exactly the this
power consumption of the rest of the
system then you've got kind of a
variable there and the reason that
measure is taken is because for things
like GPUs it's strictly speaking it's
easier and it is I mean that's that's
really mostly it because you can current
clamp the power cables go into the GPU
that's not difficult at all but to then
also get the power going through the
socket that's kind of hard because
ideally you'd do something like a riser
cable and then you splice off the the 12
volt lines maybe make a bit longer and
clamp those but that is also kind of
difficult to do properly
I've spoken with build Zoid about this
in the past wave some solutions but
there are ways to do it absolutely
Allan mal Ventana when he was at PC / he
would do this type of thing - to just
get only the GP power draw in a GP power
consumption test by clamping the right
things by door through a riser measuring
that with I don't know if it was an
external controller or a clamp but there
are ways to do that
it's just that typically you see total
system power consumption so if you see
500 Watts check to see what the the
chart is for if it says total system
power consumption that's not the power
consumption of the video card or the CPU
or whatever you're looking up it's
everything that it's under some kind of
load remember that power fluctuates
based on load so I would account for my
expected maximum usage scenario which is
probably going to be at some point 100
percent usage and then I would look up
the power consumption of different
devices and if I can find an individual
test for it for example our CPU tests
are not total system power consumption
they are CPU only power consumption
before VRM efficiency losses are taken
into account but close enough so for our
test for CPUs you'll see an accurate
number to what's going to be drawn and
then once you figure out your power
supply
I needs your wattage needs add a bit to
that so maybe 20% to 50% overhead just
to pay on how much efficiency you want
at 50% you're gonna be a peak efficiency
of the power supply but you don't need
that much you give me at 20% or
something if you want to save some money
so figure out the wattage just by adding
things together from reviews and then
add some overhead on top of that so I
mean that's the way to do it honestly is
to look at reviews I'm of course biased
in this we do reviews but that's what I
would do so that's what I would suggest
you would do because TDP is a it's a
tricky number everyone's got a different
definition of it for your CPU is it's
more measure of how much cooling
potential is needed to keep the CPU at
spec or are under t.j.maxx now typically
TDP at least well in general is pretty
close to the actual power consumption
but not always as we've Illustrated
depends on things like MCE and then GPUs
you also have board power versus GPU
power so depending on how the
manufacturer rates their TDP that may or
may not account for memory power
consumption which is somewhat
significant as well so anyway that's
what I would do hopefully that helps a
bit next one Erik Ernst
a month ago I noticed when you overclock
processors that temperatures of each
core vary sometimes by a lot I also
noticed that on the 79 80 X II you raise
the multiplier by one time by one axe
more on the first two cores than the
rest of the course could you optimize
your overclock by raising the multiplier
on cooler cores and lowering it on the
hotter cores to equalize the
temperatures across the entire package
would that stabilize the package for
more total frequency or is a straight
overclock a better option so let me try
to jump to the the answer on this
yes so technically different cores will
overclock better than others it's
typically a pretty small difference so
for competitive overclocking when we're
fighting with while anyone on the leader
boards then it is worth it because it's
it's a lot of the times a great way to
gain extra maybe even couple hundred
points on times by extreme which is
significant and when you're at the edge
anyway to try and regain a lead so it's
worth it there I don't know that I would
say it's worth it for for my home system
excuse me because it's just it's a lot
of work and ultimately unless you're
competitively overclocking you're not
really gaining that much for real
performance a couple FPS maybe and
probably not even that so I would not
say it's worth it but to answer your
question yes
core to core overclocking is technically
the way to get the most out of the CPU
because I don't want to use really the
word binning but each core will perform
differently and that can be for a few
different reasons can be for silicon
quality it can be for where is the core
on the package if it's in a cooler area
then it might be able to run a bit a
higher frequency because it's cooler so
it's not fighting the same thermal
challenges that a hotter core may be in
the center of all the other hot cores
would be fighting giving you some extra
thermal Headroom to push the frequency a
bit higher so anyway could you optimize
across the entire package the answer is
yes and in an ideal world if you have
infinite time and you sit there and you
tune each of the in our case 18 cores
for that scenario and you find which
ones can do 5.1 which one can maybe do
5.2 and you set the others to 49 and 50
something like that so yeah hopefully
that answers your question it's the
answer is is yes you could optimize your
overclock but the answer to is it worth
it is no almost certainly not except for
competitive overclocking so next one
this one is from Lamont who said hi
Steve thanks for the informative content
you produce
been enjoying it since I stumbled into
it researching my new builds what are
the most basic benchmarking tools or the
more basic and validation tests you'd
recommend for someone who wants to
validate system performance with an
emphasis on gaming and maybe simple pre
and post overclock performance to be
primarily I don't want to become a
benchmark junkie around hours of tests
but I'd like to know if I've got any
problems where my hardware is
underperforming for example I'd like to
determine if
cpu GPU are being thermally throttled
and see what impact it has if I open the
front case door for more air intake when
gaming or modify fan curves or locations
I'm looking for the high school yearbook
greatest results least effort winners
here excellent way to phrase that
question and I can help out with that so
I think the the first thing I would
point out let's see your thermal
question first that's really easy is it
throttling so the answer is you can use
hardware info 64 it's free it's really
good we like it I've never I would love
to speak with the developer one day but
we don't know anything about them other
than they make really good software so
hardware in foot 64 is the one I use GPZ
is another one you can get the data you
need just from hardware info 64 it's
just it's it's a bit easier to use that
for CPU and then use GPZ for GPU because
um this is too much it's too much data
with harder and for 64 to scroll back
and forth so I'd recommend that and use
that for CPU is it throttling well the
cool thing is even if you don't know
t.j.maxx
you get two really obvious three four
really obvious indicators if it is
throttling one of them is a straight
list of thermal target or thermal limit
it says so it's a whole section that
says like thermal limit yes no and if it
says no all the way down then you're
good and if it says yes anywhere and the
thermal limits for any individual core
then that core has hit the thermal limit
may be 105 C on x2 99 1 on 109 on one of
those CPUs a hundred ish on the average
Intel stop CPU and then depends for AMD
so that would be the the first list to
look at this this talking after a cold
thing much harder than I remembered the
second thing to look for is also it'll
highlight red if the answer is yes it's
throttling second thing to look for is
going to be the actual temperature area
where you'll get core temperatures and
if those are hitting t.j.maxx or too
close to see it with thermal junction
max then that is a problem and you're
going to be thermal throttling probably
or very close to it so TJ max you can
either look up for the CPU
using or you just kind of I think it
tells you in hardware info in one of the
columns you look at a distance from
t.j.maxx that'll tell you how many
degrees Celsius you are away from the
maximum junction temperature that's the
one you care about an ideal you see
something like ten or more and then
you're probably pretty good at that
point as for other well there's other
places you can see throttling in there
too like just looking at the frequency
of a CPU and seeing does it drop down if
it does then it's throttling it's just a
question why is it throttling because
you forgot to remove the current or
power limitations that's pretty common
one as a throttling because the thermals
is it throttling because of a turbo
duration limit which would be stock in
toss back for example AMD has it too so
and those answers you can get through
the other column where it says like
throttle reason yes no and it's in words
not in numbers in Hardware in 464 with
Intel you could also use XT you which
will give you some additional yes/no
readouts on throttles I don't
particularly like XT you but sometimes
if we're really puzzled it can be the
best way to get an answer just because
Intel makes it so it does detect
accurately in almost all cases but
hardware for 64 on average better than
x2 you at this point so short version of
the first part the answer hardware from
64 second part gpu-z for a GPU it's
harder to tell if it's throttling
because it will completely modulate the
clock all the time it changes constantly
and what you're really looking for is a
rough average just do a mental average
and depending on the card on average
under 84 degrees Celsius you're going to
be running at boost specifications but
if you get a sounds like 60 then it'll
run maybe 25 50 megahertz high or
something like that
get it down below 60 down to 50
something like that 40 it'll boost even
higher so is it throttling well sort of
in that yes it is is clock gating based
on thermals but it's not truly thermal
throttling until you're beyond like 84
degrees on on the average NVIDIA GPU or
87 on the new ones and I am these target
barriers I I think most of theirs are
right around 80 something 90
somewhere in there so you'll start
seeing thermal throttling pretty
obviously in the frequency you want to
cross validate with performance you can
use 3d mark it's free as well at least
the version you would need is free you
can use that run the test a few times or
run it on loop or pause the demo you can
do that by clicking and and then just
look at the frequency over time in GPZ
and see if it kind of does that and
levels out and you'll see that to some
extent but you've seen it more than 35
megahertz then you might be throttling
and you can fix that with fan placement
as for validate and performance
recommendations 3d marks good it's easy
you can compare results online pretty
easily so that that makes it nice you
could use for stability
I hesitate to recommend Prime at this
point prime95 is is very easy it's a
free application it's small you could
use prime95 26.6 specifically that
version for non AVX testing it'll be
less thermally straining we have custom
settings we use but for something easy
I'd recommend just clicking the small
FFTs button and clicking go and that'll
tell you pretty quickly if you're stable
under non AVX workloads that's really
useful that's gonna be your average game
as non AVX
and it just generates a ton of heat
takes a ton of power and if it survives
that the CPU survives that for an hour
plus that it's probably going to survive
indefinitely maybe run it overnight if
you're feeling adventurous or really
want to be sure and then the next option
would be probably 95 29 point whatever
is current - I think is what we've often
used there's newer ones and that's an AV
X workload that's straining and if you
don't have a negative AV X offset then
it might not survive whether or not that
matters to you depends on how much you
use AV X workloads if you use blender
blenders and AVX software AV x
accelerated them you would want it to be
stable in in AV X workloads but that's
the most stressing you might not have a
CP that survives that not not like
physically kill it unless your settings
are really bad it won't physically kill
the CPU it just won't be stable and
you'll have to down clock or something
so those are the good options that I
could get through without just making a
whole video about this so hopefully that
gives you a starting point short version
hardware info 64 gpu-z prime95 26.6 and
29 point something small f of T is for
that and 3d mark and if you want fur
mark for power virus for the GPU be
careful with that one and it's also not
it won't enumerate the clock in the same
way you're used to seeing because it has
some protections and it so it doesn't
kill itself so you won't see the same hi
clocks you used to seen but it is a good
stressor for like BRM thermals next one
Ethan L when overclocking memory on a
GPU does it follow the same rules as
standard system memory as in your system
memory always reads half of its actual
clock speed due to reading at per
channel also based on ddr3 DDR does GPU
memory works the same way the spec page
for my EVGA 20 atti FTW 3 shows 1400
megahertz but when in precision the
clock shows at 7000 megahertz so by that
math when increasing the memory clock by
say at 350 is it functionally increasing
it by 700 is that in fact the case great
question so let me let me break this
down for you if what you're talking
about you're talking about effective
clock and actual clock so what you're
talking about for GP is so an example
actual clock you might see 17 50
megahertz effective clock you'll see it
advertised as 7,000 or 7,000 10
megahertz so if you have a gddr5 GPU
that's rated as seven gigabits per
seconds it's kind of the same as saying
seven 7,000 megahertz it's
interchangeable the way GPUs are rated
then then that is an actual block of
1750 so the reason it's easy math seven
thousand divided by x equals 1750 so
it's four and this is because for every
every clock cycle I can I can do it for
every clock cycle gddr5 can achieve four
data transfers and with DDR you you
double with DDR eww just quadrupling so
you can think of it as a formula of
bass frequency your actual frequency
1750 multiplied by the number of sort of
of pumps or of data transfers per clock
it gives you your effective clock so
1750 would be 7000 1750 actual doesn't
really matter which number you use just
be consistent use the same one for
everything and it's fine you'll also as
I said often see gigabits per second and
gigahertz used interchangeably in GPU
memory video memory no rhyme or reason
to it as people switch between them once
one's kind of a rate and one's a speed
so hopefully that helps a bit pretty
simple I think did I answer every point
of that question I think I got most of
what you asked so yeah I mean that's
that's that's what it is quadruple
basically next one scooby-dooby asks so
Unreal Engine is owned by Epic Games yes
we're aware they're there just that way
they're out the street Epic Games just
launched a steam competitor 2 on PC that
not only gives developers a bigger cut
of the pie but also incentivizes them to
use Unreal Engine by waiving the fee for
its use in games released question
exclusively on Epic Games store Unreal
Engine heavily favors Nvidia
architectures do you think this could be
the beginning of a profound shift toward
Nvidia we're pretty familiar with the
the new store and with its incentive so
it's it's cool to see it's good to see
competitors team that's that's got a
good chance now know is my answer though
I I don't think this will change
anything meaningfully unreal engines
already used everywhere that it's not
that's not a triple-a game so I think
Triple A games you'll still see them
using their own engines you're still
gonna see far grind dunia still gonna
see sniper on like a sewer or something
you're still gonna maybe not triple-a
but they're not gonna use someone else's
engine theirs is like the best you'll
still see Ubisoft on whatever engine it
is they use I forget you'll still see
modified crystal for a Tomb Raider so I
don't think it will meaningfully really
change that much
Unreal Engine is very appealing to
mid-size studios getting used by some of
the larger studios
of course we see Kingdom Hearts I think
is is getting or was remade with it it's
certainly big and we use Unreal Engine
for some stuff we do here we greatly
respect its abilities but I don't think
it's going to really change the spread
it is or introduce concerns to the GPU
market just because Epic Games has a
store now I don't think so I I'm also
not sure that it's always true or well
to what degree it is true that Unreal
Engine favors and video architectures I
know we've seen that but I don't know
we're like what is that what does that
mean you have to get two cards that are
directly comparable so maybe an RX 5/8
and a 1060 you see the 1060 outperform
the 580 or a 590 may be a better example
because it probably shouldn't on average
then yeah I would say there's an engine
benefit there but I mean I don't know I
don't think it's I don't know I'm not
worried about this at all so my answer
is no I don't think it changes anything
next one
Axios am I correct in assuming that I
will be able to put a rise in 3000
series CPU in the am 4 slot on an X 370
motherboard obviously there's no chance
of a BIOS update for PCIe gen four on
that but I'm curious as to whether X 370
would for example handle the horizon 7
or 9 3000 chip when it's eventually
released my understanding is yes you'll
be able to use it on X 370 be mindful of
vrm requirements and because those may
go up with a higher core count CPU they
will go up and mindful of BIOS updates
but my understanding is yes you would be
able to do so last couple here or last
last to Andrew or says when doing live
streams many of the astute overclockers
among us give you helpful tips on which
motherboard settings to tweak like v
mesh can you go through some of the more
obscure but still important CP
overclocking settings what they do this
was a hard question for me to think
about there are really obscure
overclocking settings and I scroll past
them a lot but that should tell you
something a lot of time we don't use
them and I've spoken with builds worried
about this and with
they're Bauer and with Stephan Z and
with Vince kingpin and there are
absolutely settings they use that I
don't use but there are also settings
that really no one uses so I don't know
how to address those I can't remember
what they're called but they're obscured
to a point of being meaningless in 99%
of use cases so it just as an example
build Zoid front of the front of the
channel and does some work for us
occasionally builds right in the past
when he was helping with some memory
overclocking I asked him ok so what did
these ones do and he could answer that
almost every time and he's he is
extremely knowledgeable really knows his
stuff but I read every now and then I
there's a million tertiary memory
timings and every now and then I'd hit
one where he'd say honestly I'm not sure
I just I make it as low as possible and
that's completely valid that's all I
needed to know is should this never be
big or small I didn't need to know
that's really how it worked now I would
love to but the point of me saying this
is that builds oi whom we consider to be
one of the best overclockers out there
also does not know every single setting
there's a lot of them and they aren't
all important so anyway to give you a
couple examples of some that I think are
not obscure but are probably reasonably
obscured to a mainstream audience or
maybe some of you so one of them memory
times in general very important for
overclocking very competitive
overclocking not often tapped into by by
most of the audience I think they most
the audience thinking back to when I was
kind of starting it's kind of like set
the core ratio and then look up what's a
safe v core and then set that I think
that's kind of how people mostly do it
so memory is really important T faulty
f8w is a good one so this is for active
window and it's the the length or it's a
period of time where in the row
activations happen four times in one
rank that's an important one the more
you can drop it and maintain stability
your performance will improve a bit
tre fi tre FC I don't consider those
obscure I talk we talk about them a lot
but if you're not familiar with
or the average overclocking probably
isn't then maybe obscure safe refresh
cycle and refresh interval you want
those to be heavily modified as well so
if you're working with overclocking or
competitive overclocking the important
thing to remember is that you want the
the memory to retain its information for
as long a period of time as possible and
to refresh it when it has to as quickly
as possible so that's what our efi
interval and re FC RFC excuse me will do
so you want for example a lower TR FC
and a really high TR efi like 30 2006
2000 whatever the board will allow for
competitive overclocking not necessarily
the best settings for everyday use but
that's a good one too - no DRAM current
limits maybe not that important but you
can actually you can current throttle on
your memory so you need to kind of max
those out ia current limits the mesh is
a good one you named so mesh voltage it
sits for uncor on the X to 99 CP is
really important on core be basically
mesh on something like this Saturday on
ATX II and that handles internship
communications it handles the memory
controller speed it handles the the
cache so stuff like that
io between the cores that's really
important and that's that's mesh and
probably not too commonly messed with I
wouldn't consider it obscure but I'm
hoping I'm hitting a few here that some
of you that don't know about IO and SAE
voltages those are important you really
need to be careful about SOC 4 Andy you
need to be careful about how high you
set those voltages those the ones I can
quickly degrade a chip and you won't
necessarily know that it's happening
spread-spectrum basically disable it
it's my approach to this one
spread-spectrum is supposed to reduce
EMI but it does so I potentially the
cost of a bit higher frequency cost of
stability potentially and then I don't
that's that's pretty good list that's
about all I got right now there are way
more obscure ones I apologize I did not
pull out a boards and go digging through
them but I guess my goal for this was
obscure ones that we still use and then
they're not that obscure but anyway last
one
steamed or as t-33 med said are we going
to see more of hypebeast Steve I sure
hope not
I really hope not and that uh that's
well the fact that I can barely talk
right now let's just let's just run with
that and end the show thank you for
watching you go to store it I Cameron
taxes net to help us out directly by
picking up one of our mule mugs or mod
maps by the way
finally shipping to us the mob Matt so
we'll have them at about ten days from
now I think so they'll be going out soon
or subscribe for more adrianna episode
will be up shortly and a second one to
the public channel if not already I
can't I can't talk anymore so I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
