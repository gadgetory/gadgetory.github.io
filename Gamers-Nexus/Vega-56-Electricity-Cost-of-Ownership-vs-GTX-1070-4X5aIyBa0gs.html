a major item of notes or in reviews but
we wanted to turn the watts into a more
relatable metric dollars we did some
simple calculations on power consumption
versus the electricity cost of the
average American household which is
apparently twelve cents per kilowatt
hour and put together a cost offset
versus the gtx 1070 some folks will pay
a whole lot more than that based on
regions so factor in your own costs as
necessary here we're using the gtx 1070
reference as a baseline because we know
it consumes less power than the RX vega
56 we're able to then offset at a
relative power consumption increase on
the 56 so if you switched to the 56 from
the 1070 we're looking at how much more
you pay per year not how much total you
pay per year before that this coverage
is brought to you by cable mod already
well-known for their work in custom
sleeved power supply cables cable mod is
now venturing into liquid cooler tubes
leaving with their new AIO sleeping kits
compatible with corsair and NZ acti as
of now check the link in the description
below for more information this is all
done pretty easily in terms of video
output this is one of our simplest ones
to make but it gives some interesting
data that is more relatable on a day to
day basis so the main thing here we're
looking at delta power consumption total
for the system we did do power testing
at the PCIe cables but not at the PCIe
slot yet and in tests and we found that
the gtx 1070 currently draws more power
to the PCIe slot then the RX vega card
does and so that means it's kind of
skewed it ends up looking like Vega
draws two times more power than the 1070
rather than a more realistic twenty to
thirty percent depending on workload so
we're looking at delta power through the
wall and our accuracy
therefore decreases as we approach idle
but it's pretty accurate as we go up
into heavier workloads particularly
using 3dmark fire strike with a frozen
screen where you basically get a fixed
constant output both at the rails and at
the wall so easy enough to use that as
our load benchmark baseline which you
can kind of use to assume render
performance or gain performance and
we're measuring that Vega 56 at 91 watts
more power than the gtx 1070
both our stock through this fire strike
benchmark it's about nine watts more
idle than the 1070 in our testing and
then it draws fifty six drives about one
hundred and six watts more power when
overclocked which is the ten seventy
overclock these are all numbers from our
review so nothing new there what is new
is what we get into when we start
calculating the different types of loads
and the cost so we're looking at idle
24/7 which is obviously unlikely but it
helps us provide a baseline to
extrapolate other numbers load 24/7 also
unlikely for probably most of you but
very realistic for folks who do
rendering or maybe our miners but in
that case you're doing a whole lot of
tuning anyway so you probably
disregarded numbers we're also looking
at load for 12 hours a day load for
eight hours a day and load for four
hours a day that would be gaming for
four hours a day on average for example
you want numbers in between there we've
given you idle at 24/7 so that you can
kind of guess where it would fall pretty
accurately and these are all calculated
using the rest of the time as idle so
basically we're doing a big assumption
here that if you buy these cards you
build a system you're at you're playing
games four hours a day so you're leaving
at idle 20 hours a day now realistically
what you might actually be doing is
either doing web browsing which is
pretty light GPU load anyway so the idle
number works or turning it off in which
case your numbers will be a bit closer
together than what we're showing here so
realistically how did all that much
because idle is just so interesting it
doesn't matter
talking nine Watts extra here so it's
kind of irrelevant but keep it in mind
so anyway remember higher is worse in
these charts let's get through them
let's start with a yearly cost and at
twenty four seven loads which again
uncommon for most of you if this will be
a worst case results for Vega improving
as we go along relative to the gtx 1070
reference the RX vega 56 stock card
would cost you an extra ninety six
dollars per year assuming twelve cents
per kilowatt-hour than the gtx 1070
which is illustrated at zero here
because again it's a baseline we're
looking at deltas over talking both
increases the cost of ownership to 111
dollars per year on the 56 over the 10
70s over clause cost but that's 24/7 of
time assuming next that you play games
or do work under load for 12 hours a day
seven days a week
cost of ownership versus the 1070 is now
53 dollars per your stock where's the
stock or
$60.00 per year OC versus OC at eight
hours per day of time again that would
be something like gaming for some of
them and maybe rendering or animation
for some of them with the other 16 hours
spent idle we see a cost increase of $38
more per year spent on the Vega 56 card
than the 1070 or $43 on both our
overclocked so I've bent down to four
hours per day load that cost is now 24
dollars more per year stock or 26 more
when overclocked if you turn off the PC
and idle times that number would
decrease by 8 dollars per year 24/7 idle
puts us at around 10 dollars more than
the GTX 970 per year for what it's worth
but if you're running a two hour
workload per day that landed between the
final two data points which is probably
realistic for a lot of gamers and here's
the cost of ownership over a period of
three years which we're assuming is the
average upgrade cycle for most people
and assuming again 12 cents per
kilowatt-hour under 24/7 load and with
stock settings the Vega 56 card would
cost an extra two hundred eighty-seven
dollars over three years for an extra
334 when overclocked for more realistic
workload we can reveal the twelve into
eight hour metrics where eight hours per
day load and sixteen hours per day idle
puts us at 115 dollars over the GTX 970
over a three-year period or $130 on both
our overclocked going down to four hours
per day changes those numbers to 72 and
seventy nine dollars stock and overclock
respectively 24/7 idle lands us at 28
dollars extra over three years you can
sort of extrapolate the rest from here
finally we ran a quick poll of our
audience on Twitter finding that most of
you maximally load your systems for four
hours per day with many chiming in that
a two-hour load is also likely though
Twitter only lets us do so many options
here's a look at how much extra the v56
costs per year over five years versus a
gtx 1070 using that four hour per day
stats for the calculation and assuming
that's idle the rest of the time or
doing things like web browsing it max
out at $120 extra over a five-year
period if running stock or 130
overclocked again the biggest assumption
here is that we're at 12 cents per
kilowatt-hour cost and assuming that the
system is idle under the other 20 hours
per day so at this point what you want
to do is take your own cost for
electricity if you don't know it you can
find them online per region pretty
easily
and calculate based on that so the big
pin is we've given you the numbers you
can use if you wanted to calculate this
yourself
there are kilowatt hour cost calculators
out there that will do the work for you
you type in how many hours it will run
in our case that was 24 down to 4 and
then you type in these numbers so first
stock the RX Vega 56 and 3 mark
firestrike was drawing 90 watts more
power than the 1070 so you would type in
91 times however many hours and the
output is the Delta that means how much
more it costs Bennett M 70 not how much
it costs total you'll pay a lot more
total because you've got the whole rest
of the computer to pay for but we're
looking at more than a 1070 here as in
video card the video card comparison
that's the first one if you want to
guess for idle or calculate it you put
in nine watts at the same however many
hours it would be idle and that's the
extra power consumption there if you're
overclocked we found 106 watts more than
the overclocked n270 reference that'll
change if you do aftermarket perhaps
you're adding board cards I'm adding
board partners and then finally the
other difference was 46 Watts more Vega
56 when it was overpowered 50% and
under-voltage
versus a 1070 which was not under
voltage but was overclocked so not the
most linear comparison but if you're
planning to do under Bolton you can
calculate it that way so that will give
you the tool to do this yourself for
your own cost I know some people for
example in Australia have an insane
electricity cost compared to here where
we're at about 10 cents per kilowatt
hour but how much this matters really
depends on the region I'm not going to
tell you if it's a lot or a little
because I'm not going to sit here and
calculate it for every single region and
also frankly the amount that it matters
really depends on your situation a lot
because let's say we're looking at a
high number two or three hundred dollars
over three years cost of ownership extra
to buy Vega
well that may really matter to some
people maybe $300 more means they buy 10
somebody instead alternatively if you
don't have the money now then it might
matter more to you now to buy the tard
that whichever comes out to be cheaper
we don't know if it'll be 56 yet depends
on what happens with pricing at launch
but
just assume something's here if you're
assuming that you save money with one
card but you spend more overtime how
much that matters again depends on how
much money you have now and if it makes
more financial sense for you to spend it
today or for you to spend it later over
a period of X years so that's up to you
but we've given you some info I just
thought it was kind of interesting to
point it out because everyone's talking
about power consumption but that it kind
of gets out of hand what that means
without relating it back to money which
is ultimately a large part of what
matters outside of arguments that we're
not going to get into like energy
efficiency overall or carbon footprint
or things like that we're staying away
from those but you have the rest of the
numbers so as always thank you for
