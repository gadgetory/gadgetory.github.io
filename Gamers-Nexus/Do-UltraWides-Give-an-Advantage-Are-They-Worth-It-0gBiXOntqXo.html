ultra wise we are specifically looking
at a 2560 by 1080 display next to me
here this is a cheap ultra wise probably
about $500 we've also got the Acer
predator which is more than $1000 and
that is a 34 inch 34 40 by 1440
resolution display so we're looking at
those two monitors right now or mostly
looking at this and the objective here
is to look specifically for whether
ultra wide give an advantage in
competitive games or just in more casual
gaming like GTA 5 or something like that
so the advantage points would be on the
competitive side obviously you can see
more because it's 21 by 9 so you've
actually really expanded your horizontal
view space even though your vertical is
about the same and then the advantage
for less competitive games would just be
what is the immersion benefit from an
ultra wide display and is there one at
all and then of course the side item
here that we'll be looking at as we go
through these multiple games we're gonna
be playing today on camera is the
compatibility question so there's a lot
of sort of forum topics out there are
ultra wide Xand games compatible on
large scales and that's one of the
things we'll be looking at so we're
going to start off with grand theft auto
5 just because it's a very easy
demonstration and a couple things to
note here with GTA 5 1 it takes eternity
to load and that does not change despite
your resolution to the GTA 5 cutscenes
do actually column box your display so
when I say column box or some people
call it pillar boxing it basically drops
a big vertical black bar over here on
the left and the right alright so now
we've got the GTA 5 game loaded and this
is actually the first scene in the game
you can see that cutscene is boxing us
in on the sides here it does some boxing
on its own obviously because you can see
the UI is actually bleeding over and
then it'll expand once the games in so
now we're in the boxing is is less bad
but it's still there and that's because
we currently have it set to as you'll
see here the 1080 resolution with a 16
by 9 aspect ratio so you got 16 by 9
1080 resolution and this is what the
game looks like if you're running a
normal widescreen ie not ultrawide
monitor so for most of you this is
probably
you'd be seen on your own system at home
so take note here of what we've got in
our viewport I'm gonna line this up so
that it's easier to match so we're
lining up to the left limiter is up
against that wall over there this this
bar and then we've got almost to the
kneecap here on this person let's
increase the resolution and see if we
get any gains here so go up to 2560 by
1080 21 by 9 aspect ratio 60 Hertz
refresh rate for this display let's keep
those changes and I have not moved the
camera at all so you can see our bar
that was here has now expanded all the
way actually past even the the wall in
the room so now we can see the camera up
in the ceiling and we can see some more
elements over here and for the person
this probably easier one we were stopped
about here on the middle of the shin now
we can see almost to their head where we
can't see their head so that sort of
shows how much extra you can see an
ultra-wide and in the b-roll here we'll
show you the game benchmark so there's a
benchmark for GTA 5 that has some really
good landscapes sort of wide-angle
landscape shots of Hollywood or the
equivalent of Hollywood and GTA 5 and
that shows the ultra wide difference
between 2009 and 16 by 9 for your aspect
ratio so in GTA specifically yes there
is actually an advantage in terms of
immersion and if you're playing GTA
online and any sort of semi competitive
or griefing matter then I suppose there
might be a slight gain there but we'll
talk at the end about how competitively
even though you can see more it might
not actually make sense for you in terms
of trying to get more kills or something
like that in a competitive game we'll
talk about that at the end but in terms
of more visibility yes you can see more
things let's move on to the next game so
now we're going to look at Counter
Strike global Offensive this is a
competitive title it is built for
competition GTA is sort of a mix between
it's more casual than anything really
csgo because it is competitive there are
some restrictions imposed by valve and
this goes for dota 2 as well and many
other competitive games where they don't
want to grant an unfair huge advantage
players with a wider of use viewable
screen space of their games so you can
see it's kind of working out here we can
the full loading screens and then once
the game loads it's doing what dota does
I'm not sure I'm not sure 106 means I
think we've got got some kind of error
on Valve's connectivity's or servers
here but so we've boxed in on the sides
and it does not scale the UI to the
screen space if we go to options and
video settings we can get the 2560 here
and if you look at the aspect ratio
though it's a sixteen by nine there's no
21 by nine option and there are ways to
try and sort of cheat this into working
with the ultra wide gaming or sorry the
widescreen gaming forums and they've got
some tools but from what I saw the most
recent stuff is not is not as functional
as it should be so let's do offline with
bots and just do an arms race and take a
look at how the the screen scales with
ultra wide well it's cutting off a lot
there should be a loading bar down like
it's way down here go all right so we're
finally in a match here let's use the
CTS and we've got some actual decent
visibility on the sides but the scaling
is a bit odd in some places specifically
the UI so you look at the UI these
losing health over here quickly health
and ammo are very far pushed to the
sides of the display which does make it
actually a little bit more difficult to
play the game this is something we
talked out with some pro players from
other games even tf2 and sort of asked
you know with wide screens or ultra wide
screens is it so wide that looking
around side to side on the display
actually hinders your ability to play
adequately and and actually the answer
for that generally was yes a lot of them
preferred skinnier display is like a 23
inch normal wide screen because it
allowed for better better ability to
view the whole screen space quickly
without having to move your head around
physically of course physical movement
is the biggest bottleneck in any
competitive scenario so counter strikes
it's not really work properly with ultra
wide you would generally want to scale
down
and and just go back to a normal display
resolution and then boxing the sides
with those column boxes which you can
just do by changing the resolution to
1080 and setting it to a 16 by 9 aspect
ratio so this is not a great game for
ultra wide displays but one that is
worth trying nonetheless and this is
really on Valve's and the same is true
for dota 2 where the you I will do this
exact thing where it sort of boxing
itself into the middle of the display
because it's more built for 16 by 9s and
there's a whole competitive thing where
Valve doesn't want to grant players with
ultra wide is a huge advantage now the
same is true for Starcraft 2 which we
don't have installed in this computer
because it's ancient and we don't test
with it anymore
but Starcraft 2 does not support ultra
wise properly either it had a brief fix
through the widescreen gaming forum
there was a tool that fixed it but that
no longer works with the legacy of the
void patch that came out so Starcraft 2
is no good either on the competitive
front games that are good however call
of duty black ops 3 just came out and
even though it's kind of between
competitive and casual on the PC it's
not as heavy competitive scene as Xbox
it is still a competitive game and they
do have proper ultra wide support with
21 by 9 aspect ratio in their natively
which we'll see in a moment ok so now
we're looking at call of duty black ops
3 this is a pretty good title for ultra
wide demonstrations as you can see we've
already got it working in the 2560 by
1080 resolution you can see a lot on the
Border's and you can also see that the
field of view is a little bit crazy so
that is mostly known by looking here at
the arm if we lower this fov feel the
view of course is critical to
determining how much you can see we
lower it down to something more modest
maybe 90 you will see that less of that
forearm is visible now it looks a little
bit less contortion it I suppose and the
the screen in general is going to be
pushed in a little more so with a wider
field of view just like with cameras
you're sort of opening up the borders of
the screen space let's just put that to
the max and see what it looks like
and now we can see a whole lot of the
game let's look at our cutoff points
here do something easy so I'm going to
set the cutoff point to that chimney on
the left and then we're gonna do see
here this should be better here we go so
we got the two trees there right at the
border for each of the trees we change
that fov it will come inward towards the
house or the shack we hit apply on that
and now you can see we can't even see
the left tree anymore so that's a pretty
substantial difference by going from 120
to 9 the fov and then we've cut off half
this tree as well but the thing is if
you go too wide with fov there's
something you can do with any monitor
it's not just ultra wide you go too wide
with an fov setting and it will actually
start sort of warping things as you
approach them on the left or the right
in this case and that the the amount
that these things warp when you come
near them will be less significant when
you're on an ultra wide display because
the nature of being a wider screen so it
does allow you to get away with a higher
fov before these sort of undesirable
warping effect comes into play and when
you're playing competitively online
you'll notice that because as you're
tracking a target if they come near you
it actually does get harder to hit them
because the the movement is no longer
one-to-one so normally I I have played
pretty successfully at a 110 fov with
this ultra wide setup without giving up
too much of the the sort of ratio of how
the game looks and graphically with that
warping effect I'm sure there are plenty
of players out there who are far more
serious than I am who can tolerate the
120 fov but for what I do
110 works pretty well with ultra wide
and on the sixteen by nine is I do
actually lower it a bit more just to
sort of reduce that contorted look of
the graphics so that's black ops 3 it is
fully functional let's let's do one last
demonstration here and just show the
1080 versus 1080p versus the ultra wide
1080 so we're going to do our borders
here with the right side is line up to
the right of the dam left side sort of
just in the middle of this rock over
here we're at 110 F of
if we drop this resolution to 1920 by
1080 it should update the aspect ratio
on its own yes it did update so we you
can see we can actually see the same
amount of screen space so that's what I
wanted to show here is that with the fov
setting because it is set to in this
case 110 we can see the same with a
1080p display as we can with an ultra
wide 1080 display but if you look at the
arm here it's a little bit crazy that is
not natural looking our ultra warrior
soldier guy now has a twig arm and as we
approach these objects they do sort of
look a little bit with the way they move
around but that does work you can get
the same view in terms of the visible
area in-game with the fov being set the
same between the resolutions but you
would want to lower it for these lower
resolutions so that is where the ultra
light comes into play do you get an
advantage I don't really think that you
get sort of a huge advantage with this
sort of thing but you can definitely see
more with a wider fov and you can
maintain a wider fov if you've got the
the bigger aspect rate the 21 by 9
aspect ratio so sort of up for you to
decide on that one how you play Call of
Duty specifically but that is one of the
games as a better demonstration for
ultra wide so one last game type here to
talk about is grand strategy with some
strategy games RTS like Starcraft 2
ultra wide just doesn't even work with
MOBAs it's kind of hit and miss and with
grand strategy because they're not
competitive it actually works pretty
perfectly especially with Total War so
one of the games I actually personally
play a lot is Rome 2 total war a bit old
now but that one works perfectly with 21
by 9 and it really opens up your view
space of the campaign map and of the
in-game battles whether or not it's
worth it the value in terms of paying
extra for an ultra-wide is not something
we're going to discuss here you can find
that our ultra-wide reviews but in terms
of actual being able to see more yeah
you can see more of the campaign map
which is useful just for management it's
not competitive so there's no real
advantage competitively obviously but
there is usefulness in terms of emerge
and the same is true for the in-game
battles you can see more so you can
actually manage your units a bit better
and that is useful for moving units
around to respond to events as they
happen in game with a bit more agility
than maybe a 16 by 9 aspect ratio so the
one thing to fall back on here for
ultra-wide is the manner of doesn't
actually matter when you're comparing
something like a 23 inch 16 by 9 versus
maybe a 29 inch 21 by 9 within the game
the competitive game space and
competitively the people we've talked to
who are far more competitive and able to
speak to this have generally come to the
conclusion that they'd rather run a
smaller display with a 16 by 9 aspect
ratio than the 21 by 9 specifically
because they can sort of not physically
move their heads and that's one thing to
keep track of is if you're looking
around physically that is going to have
greater latency than anything else in
game even than just moving your mouse a
little bit to gain that extra
side-to-side view space that you get on
an ultra-wide natively so that's all we
wanted to show with the ultra wide sort
of show some in-game footage of how they
look we've gotten all tried benchmark if
you want to see the game benchmarks
productivity is not really covered here
it does help with productivity though
and then of course it's basically just a
bevel list multi display setup so thank
you for watching the video check out the
ultra wide benchmark for GP performance
and ultra wide settings and then we'll
have some reviews coming up shortly of
this display the cheaper one and the
more expensive one if you want to learn
about these things from a value
standpoint which we did not cover today
