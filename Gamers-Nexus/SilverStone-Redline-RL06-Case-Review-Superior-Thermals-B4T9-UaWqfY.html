silverstone at redline 0-6 which gets
the first taste of some updated testing
methods in our suite so they're not done
yet silver stones are l06 case was
poised to be the best thermal performer
on our bench in some time using this
mesh front to help in a world overrun
with glass the silverstone our l06 comes
in white with silver trim black with red
trim and white with different fans
implemented vr l06 pro is what we're
reviewing today and that one's priced at
$75 MSRP before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by EVGA and
their 1080p is c2 which we've
recommended fairly highly for its build
quality and the icx sensors which are
kind of fun to play with you can check
our full st to review for the 1080i if
you're curious to learn more or you can
click the link in the description below
to find the product page for the 1080i
SD to four basics the silverstone are
l06 sizes up at two hundred by four
seventy seven by four fifty five
millimeters with pipe depth and weighs
six point three kilograms the enclosure
we're reviewing includes it three fans
for front intake one rear fan and
options for top fans all the included
fans are 120 millimeters with RPM up to
around 1400 plus or minus the usual
range CPU tower cooler clearance is 158
millimeters meaning it fits most
appropriate coolers on the market for
the price in this case is priced
similarly to a couple others we've
reviewed recently including the corsair
270 are the kind of old but still
relevant NZXT s340 and the fractal
define c after that we start getting
it's a 100 dollar territory where you've
got things like the 400 see and stuff
like that s 340 elite but for direct
competition it's looking like 270 r and
fractal define c on our bench along with
some other items will have on there but
this one is quite a bit different from
some of the other 70 ish 80s dollar
cases that we've reviewed in the past
year and that's because this has a
return to mesh front intake so it should
be a much better thermal performer as
we'll see soon it's got a mesh top mesh
front no tempered glass and is a fairly
standard in
instruction overall but just comes down
to do you want noise performance or
thermal performance this one targets
thermals which is not something we've
seen a whole lot in the last year so
that will be interesting to test
starting off first with ease of
installation features prior to getting
to the thermal Zen noise testing the
solar sound are l06 proved a little more
difficult to work with then seemed
necessary the our l06 has some space
constraints lacking some of the cable
management features of the fractal
defined see like its depth in the rear
side panel or kale management features
in cases like the SD 40 and elites where
it's got a cable bar the RL zero six
does no work for you in this department
you'll be left to your own devices to
manage the cables there is an acceptable
number of cable tie points on the rear
side but they're placed around cutouts
in such a way that cable tied to them
will be clearly visible from outside the
case vertical space is limited there's a
chunky shroud in the bottom which is a
bit of a trend but that does mean you've
got more limited vertical space and it
may be difficult to fit some plugs
through the upper most cutouts the
shroud size does mean that there's
plenty of breathing room for the PSU
however which makes routing cables under
the motherboard and over the top of the
PSU easier than other cases of this type
this also means that it captures nearly
all the airflow from the bottom 120
millimeter fan and doesn't smother the
hard drives that will be in the same
shroud area power supply has to be slid
in sideways through the shroud you can't
install through the back and that's
again a bit different but speaks to the
price focus of the case and there's
plenty of room to get it in through the
side just don't use an oversight its PSU
so RL 0 6 is undeniably a budget case at
first glance there are no glaring flaws
but there are small details everywhere
that indicate the cost savings to the
user for example silver rivets on the
back of the case mean that this job is
done after painting assembly and it
normally is assembled after painting but
they're not using the painted rivets so
very small thing there there are no
rubber grommets anywhere that is
actually a somewhat important cost
savings for these cases and there are no
thumb screws for the expansion slots
there's also no removable frame for the
power supply like you get with the s340
type cases or course
or 600 cks aside males are held on with
standard metal tabs at none of the fancy
sliding or folding out functionality
none of these affect the functionality
of the case overall but it is a point
that you should take note of if you're
trying to keep an eye out for those
finer details it does however help
reduce cost for the user as always
appearance is subjective but it's
refreshing to see a case offered in a
color other than plain black the white
LEDs in the front of the case are bright
true white rather than a bluish tint
that RGB LEDs produced and the mesh
front showcases them without allowing
too much light through the front panel
is slick fingerprint prone plastic which
isn't a problem with the white case but
could be a much worse problem with the
black version though after you build it
once you probably stop touching it
anyway it's also unfortunately molded in
such a way that the parts don't quite
fit flush with the side panel but not a
huge deal here the three LED fans are
high quality comparable Silverstone fans
cost about twelve to fifteen dollars on
new egg making the fan to easily have
the total value of the case if you're
just looking at hard MSRP is to the user
many cases like the BitFenix Shogun
included only a few of the cheapest fans
possible to bring down the retail price
silver stones added value by including a
sufficient number of fans of a
sufficient quality so you don't have to
swap them out and waste money on a pad
fans with a new case there's an
integrated fan hub on the backside of
the motherboard to further improve value
in the cooling department and
Silverstone is really not messing around
with the subtle side intakes or anything
like that
there goes in the front and comes out
the back plain and simple nothing with
glass panels or side front intake
amalgams that we've seen in many other
cases lately get into the thermals and
noise as always the testing methodology
is linked in the description below for
the article we have a few new tests here
that don't have any comparative data for
other cases yet we've got a main chart
of course with all the other cases on it
but the news tests are something we're
still playing around with see if they
don't we'll take p3 that reviewing next
should have more of that but is they
doing here with this and we're using
blender will soon be using 3d mark for
some mixed workload tests in addition to
the normal torture workload solar stones
are l06 is the coolest case on our bench
receive you thermals entirely thanks to
its mesh front this seems to be a fading
trend in modern cases
but still provides the best intake cool
impossible no matter how big a gap is
used for the front side intake options
when you have a glass front with the
case fans configured to their maximum
rpm of 1400 the Silversun are l06
enables our tower cooler to keep the CPU
at forty seven point eight Celsius
delta-t over ambient went under a
hundred percent load idle temperatures
are around to see thousands he over
ambient and because performance was so
strong with this case we lowered our PM
to a thousands and ran the test again
even with this slower speed that the CPU
maintains a delta T value of under 50 C
in fact it's cooler than the five 70 X
which was previously our performance
leader this difference emerges because
the five 70 X uses a giant glass panel
in front of its intake fans though
compensates in ways with large gaps on
either side of that front panel and it
does have higher rpm fans and three fans
of the front to help out some more the
next case
behind these is the 270 are another
Corsair design with the frackle does
fine see it serving as the coolest of
the quiet cases Silverstone is a clear
performance leader in the sea view
thermals of the cases we've tested thus
far let's look at GPU thermals GP
performance testing on our dual axle
gaming X at 55% fan speeds also found
that our l0 sticks in the lead the 1,400
rpm configuration places us at forty 7.1
Celsius delta-t over a mint followed
closely by the : ends 1100 rpm
configuration the : end positions its
front fans in a way that more directly
point at the GPU helping it take the
second place spot the 1000 rpm our l06
follows the Cullinan reducing noise
levels while maintaining fifty-one salty
as Delta G over ambient we're going to
show a preview of some of our new tests
here there's still a lot to be done on
this front since we don't have a
comparative data yet but this is the
light introduction we're starting to use
blender and 3d mark mixed workloads for
case thermal benchmark in addition to
thermal testing just to give some
perspective on user workload the
thermaltake p3 again will feature all of
that first off we're measuring CPU and
GV temperatures during these tests to
help understand how well the case
exhausts heat build up during upload on
one component and not both rendering on
the GPU we see a temperature of 24.7 C
delta T over a min GPU temperature we've
got that CPU temperature alongside it as
well during that test CPU delta T reach
34.4 celsius rendering
the CPU it may be hard to interpret
these numbers of that comparative data
about ambient temperature was around
twenty to twenty two point five drain
tests and will soon have comparative
data with the thermal tape p3 anyway
these tests by the way were done at 1000
RPM say B bit cooler once at 1400 let's
go to noise levels here's where we find
out what the trade-off is for that
chart-topping thermal performance as
you'd expect a mesh front doesn't do us
favors in noise despite lower
temperatures neither choice is
inherently wrong just depends on you
build goals at 1,400 rpm at silverstone
our l06 is the loudest system build
we've tested on this chart operating at
43 DB a more noise escapes this
enclosure given the mesh front and
that's of course in exchange for more
air and drain it this makes the system
about as loud as the Corsair 5 70 X when
it's fans were operating at full speed
looking at 1000 rpm as a variant we're
now down to 37 DBA on the RL 0 6
Silverstone case putting it between the
270 our 1300 rpm and s 240 1300 rpm
enclosures given that Silverstone still
holds a lead in thermals with 1000 rpm
speeds we think the case makes its best
noise and temperature compromise at this
1000 rpm mark sure it's not as quiet as
the be quiet pure bass 600 it's also
significantly cooler and doesn't contain
the word quiet in its brand name so
that's the RL 0 6 the case at $75 is
priced about where it should be a lot of
the shroud mid tower cases are in the 70
to $80 price point you start getting
fancier as you trend towards $100 which
is kind of the top end hard line of the
of this type of case you get something
like the 400 C at that point but we're
trying to spend less this case is one
that we have liked for its airflow
that's a bit different from what we've
seen lately the trend has been towards
noise rather than airflow there's really
no better between noise and airflow just
it depends on what you want so if you're
focused on noise really firmly and
that's extremely important to you the
most important part of a case then don't
buy this but if you really care about
airflow and noise as long as it's 37 ish
DBA at least with our bench obviously
you have to factor in the fact that the
parts inside also makes noise 37 DBA in
our bench which is a fairly standard
build
is fine to you then this is a good case
the cooling is fantastic it's a small
box it's fairly portable if you need to
move it the airflow is very directed so
we've got the top two fans pointed
straight up the CPU cooler if you've got
a tower cooler and straight up the GPU
cooler and then the bottom fan does help
save away any concerns of heating up on
the drive components which are inside
the power supply shroud if you're
running 3.5 inch hard drives so that's
the case good overall it's got a couple
of small flaws but you do trade off for
those you've got lower cost as a result
of some of them like the side panels
just they're not exciting the way they
mount in this match but for twenty-five
dollars cheaper than something that is
more exciting like the 400 C it's not a
bad trade as always it you can find the
