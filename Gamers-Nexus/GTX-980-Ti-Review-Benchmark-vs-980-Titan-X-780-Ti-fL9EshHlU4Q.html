nexus net and today we're talking about
the new gtx 980 TI from nvidia this has
just launched as part of computex and
the 980 TI has had a lot of rumors
around it for quite a while now but yes
it is a real card it is here and there
have been a few rumors that came out
recently that we're on and the major one
is price the GTX 980 TI is priced at six
hundred and fifty dollars which makes it
extremely competitive and puts it at
about where the 780 ti was when it first
launched along with this introduction
comes the price drop of the GTX 980
which was originally five hundred fifty
dollars MSRP I'd SAT around 550 to 600
for retail depending on who you bought
from and the 980 has now been dropped to
five hundred dollars so we've got a 150
gap in there the Titan ax still remains
at a thousand dollars and is a bit more
powerful than both of these cards the
market placement for the GTX 980 TI has
it still strictly focused as a gaming
card and this is a thin for Maxwell
Maxwell it's very gaming focused and
that's something I'll discuss in a
moment it's also positioned to take
advantage of virtual reality displays as
they come out and of 4k and 1440
resolution monitors and to this end
there's been a bigger push to focus on
memory bandwidth and increased
processing power themes like that
looking at the core specs of the three
primary cards we're talking out today
we'll throw in the titan acts as well
the 780 ti had 2880 cuda cores on it
when it first shipped and 3 gigabytes of
video memory and this was a very
powerful card for its time the GTX 980
shift at 2048 CUDA cores so it's about
800 fewer and had four gigabytes of
video memory and the 980 TI has 2816
cuda cores 2816 with six gigabytes of
video memory for reference the Titan X
which is a gaming focus Titan not a dual
precision Titan has 3072 cuda cores a
bit more than the 980 TI and 780 ti and
the Titan acts also has 12 gigabytes of
video memory make a note though that the
cuda cores efficiency has improved
greatly with Max while they're about
forty percent more efficient than on
Kepler and for this reason the seven
ti &amp;amp; 989 a TTI are not directly
comparable by pure numbers when looking
at core account the 780 ti would be
advantaged in some applications that
care less about gaming related
technologies or technologies like Delta
color compression that are definitely an
aid to bandwidth and gaming tasks but
may not be too useful when you're
dealing with things like raw encoding so
adobe premiere photoshop applications
like that strive for all of the
processing power they can get their
hands on and to this end having
increased compute power would actually
be beneficial for you for gamers the
core count doesn't really matter too
much as a wrong number when you're
looking between architectures because it
is a nonlinear comparison we can't look
at Fermi architecture and directly
compare core count to Maxwell for
instance and this is true for CPUs as
well Intel AMD both have different
architectures from generation to
generation the GTX 980 TI has 22
streaming multiprocessors or SMS and
each one has 96 kilobytes of shared
memory which is a pretty big increase
over the 780 Ti which had 64 kilobytes
of shared memory the 980 TI has 176 tmus
or texture mapping units and I've
described this on the website if you're
curious what those are it's also got an
increased memory bandwidth over the GTX
980 by fifty percent which puts it at
336 point five gigabytes per second so
that's one of the more noteworthy
differences all the other specs are on
the screen the target audience for this
video card is definitely gamers it is
not meant for users who want precision
the titans ii and original titan are
still better for that than even the
titan x which has won 30 seconds the DP
throughput of single precision
processing but for gaming we don't
really care about dual precision in fact
it can actually be a hindrance because
you're doing all this extra processing
that we don't want for a video game it's
not a simulation it's not a scientific
application so it doesn't need that
extra layer of precision the GTX 980 TI
has the same GM 200 GPU that the Titan X
comes equipped with just with fewer
cores they feel of them are disabled and
obviously it's using less memory on the
heart itself as with all Maxwell devices
at least the second iteration of Max
while for the 750 Ti the architecture
the technology all that's going to be
the same as what I've discussed in the
GTX 980 video in the past and the tight
next videos and articles view of the
core items include things like Delta
color compression which I mentioned
previously it looks at Delta values
frame to frame temporally of the colors
presented in a game and then it uses the
Delta between those two color values
rather than an absolute this reduces the
power required to derive the new color
and rendered to the screen and all that
so it improves our efficiency overall
I'd like to make a quick note before
getting to the benchmarks that n videos
put out a lot of other news this week as
well including updates on Direct X 12
which is Microsoft's product of course
and I don't want anyone to confuse the
fact that the Direct X 12 technologies
and the GTX 980 TI are not mutually
exclusive you don't need the 980 TI to
use some of the DX 12 technologies that
are being discussed this week any dx12
feature level 12 112 underscore one is
how its illustrated on paper is going to
be supportive of the conservative raster
that's being discussed and of other tech
for DX 12 so you don't need a TI you can
get just the 980 just or tight necks or
970 or any other card that supports 12
for its feature level or 12 under score
one for the conservative raster and
those other texts and AMD will be in the
same boat as this once they start
pushing new cards out just to quickly go
over a few of those Direct X 12 features
that Nvidia and Microsoft are talking
about a copy tags and other events
conservative raster and volume titled
resources are the main items that are
being showcased right now volume tiled
resources is an addition to the existing
tiled resources function and directx
this adds a third parameter to data
structures when handling game assets so
that's what volume titled resources does
it adds a third parameter and that third
parameter can be something like volume
quite simply and this ensures that for
example visible components of a texture
are drawn to the screen but the parts
fancy aren't wasted in the GPU we're not
burning resources retaining the full
texture if only a small piece of it is
used if you know what rastering is then
conservative rastering is basically just
an advancement on that for GPU
technology and this is a feature that's
not unique to the 980 TI but will be
available on it rastering is when the
geometry of a game is translated into
pixels and you can see on this image
that we have here what's going on the
GPU takes samples from the middle of the
pixel and then it looks to determine
whether that sample is inside or outside
of the geometry so if you sample the
middle the pixel and it's inside the
geometry then it's shown green in this
image and it translates into pixels with
conservative rastering it's a bit
different conservative rastering counts
any piece of geometry touching a pixel
as in the geometry so if you have a
piece of a pixel hanging in between the
geometry and outside of it but its
sample it's just barely outside of it it
will still be counted as in the geometry
and that reduces the shimmering edge of
a fine line in game by including
adjacent pixels and then filters them
appropriately talking about the
benchmarks for the 980 TI we did a ton
of benchmarks there are a lot of charts
i tested 4k 1440 and 1080 for various
games with a whole suite of video cards
we excluded some of the lower end cards
because it's really not within the price
range of the ti so if you're looking at
this you don't care about like a 250 x
7850 750 ti for the most part because
there are so many charts and this is so
deep I recommend that you go to the
article for the full benchmark
information if you want to see a
particular game I'll just recap it here
quickly in metro last light at 4k with
high and high settings tessellation and
quality the 980 TI performs effectively
identically to the Titan X this is
within a margin of error 1 FPS away do
this end if you're just gaming and you
don't care about some of the other
things that the Titan acts would be good
at then you should definitely be
considering the 980 TI perhaps in
opposition to the tie tonight and save
quite a bit of money the 780 ti sits at
35 FPS below the 980 now there is
current
a driver issue with a 78 700 series
cards including the 780 ti where they're
underperforming that's being worked on
but either way it's clear that there is
a large gain and performance with the
980 TI over the last generations card
looking at shadow of mordor on 4k we
replaced a co on our benchmark with
shadow of mordor the Titan X and 980 TI
again are just barely outside of margin
of error so there is a real difference
here the tight max is just better by a
small difference of 2 FPS and then the
1980s at 35 FPS so that's a bigger jump
it's got much lower point 1% values as
well at 24 verses 30 and 33 1440 the
Titan axis again 2 FPS ahead of the 980
TI the nine 80s at 62 FPS well within
playable range and even the 780 ti the
970 the 290x are all fine 285 s getting
a bit on the the slower side to the
point where you wouldn't be able to play
for 1440 with this here's a few other
charts like far cry 4 grid i've got the
witcher as well and the witcher is worth
noting we disabled hair works
anti-aliasing and used SSAO for this
right more linear comparison with the
test we've already done which were
inclusive of AMD and AMD is not very
good at tessellation so they're not very
good with hair works so that is all for
the benchmarks I'm showing you a couple
more here just in case but do check the
article linked in the description below
for the full review including a
discussion of the architecture and
things like that if you're not familiar
with it from the previous cards the 980
TI is an interesting device it launched
at six hundred fifty dollars which makes
it extremely competitive even with
NVIDIA zone Titan mags and it's very
similar to a Titan X I don't want to say
that it's basically a tight next because
there are some core differences
literally there are fewer cores and
there's the half the vram games right
now don't use 12 gigabytes of video ram
not that i can find at least and very
few of them use more than for a couple
will if it's available but the
performance gap does start dwindling
depending on which game you're testing
so six gigabytes is ample and the core
count on the 980 TI is certainly ample
as well it's
basically the same performance as the
Titan acts with the games we tested and
if you're playing similar games you're
considering these two cards I would push
you hard toward the 980 TI it is a
significant value gained over the TX the
980 is now five hundred dollars and it
might be 550 after the the manufacturer
changes and that's a big enough
difference where you should still be
strongly considering a 980 as well
depending on what your budget is the TI
is a good performance gain at higher
resolutions at 1080 the 980 is still a
very strong card it's not going anywhere
it does fine with 1440 on some games
especially most games with settings
lowered but the 980 TI is a better
performer for the higher resolutions
like 4k most definitely and 1440 at
times where the 980 falls flat and then
Andy's closest competition that I have
available is the 290x they of course
have the 295 X 2 video card but that is
a dual GPU solution and is not directly
comparable to a single GPU solution like
the 980 TI so I'm not going to draw
those comparisons because they're not
comparable they're very different in
their execution of what they're trying
to do and I just don't have one so I
can't test it anyway the 290x is still a
cheap card I hesitate sometimes with
recommending AMD right now strictly
because of the driver the slowness of
driver updates and that's not me being
mean the AMD it's if you look at their
drivers December was the last day will
update and then they did put out a beta
patch just recently for The Witcher 3 so
that's good at least they're doing stuff
like that but at the end of the day if
you're looking at the 980 TI it's
because you're ready to spend 500 plus
dollars so i would strongly suggest
looking at these charts for the 980 TI
980 and tight necks i would say probably
eliminate the titan ex unless you have a
specific reason to buy it and i would
not be aware of that reasons that's up
to you the 980 TI is a good card for
high resolutions 980 is still very
strong even at the higher resolutions
but the hundred one hundred fifty dollar
gap is enough to make you consider
depend on how much money you've got
available for this build if you want the
the TI or the 980 and the 980 TI is very
good value
happy with the card and it performs well
and then for things like premiere and
photoshop if you're mostly doing that
and not gaming then and you've got a
780ti that's still a perfectly good card
for those types of tasks and I don't
know that I'd recommend upgrading right
now unless your card sort of on its last
legs or if you could use the extra video
memory and that just depends on what
you're doing which applications you're
using you'll have to research that so
that is all for this video card check

the full article and of course if you
