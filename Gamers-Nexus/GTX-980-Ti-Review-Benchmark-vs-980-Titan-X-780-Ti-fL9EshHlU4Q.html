nexus net and today we're talking about
the new gtx 980ti from nvidia this has
just launched as part of Computex and
the 980ti has had a lot of rumors around
it for quite a while now but yes it is a
real card it is here and there have been
a few rumors that came out recently that
we're on and the major one is price the
gtx 980ti is priced at 650 dollars which
makes it extremely competitive and puts
it at about where the 780 Ti was when it
first launched along with this
introduction comes the price drop of the
GTX 980 which was originally $550 MSRP
it's at around 550 to 600 for retail
depending on who you bought from and the
980 has now been dropped to $500 so
you've got a 150 gap in there the Titan
axe still remains at $1000 and is a bit
more powerful than both of these cards
the market placement for the gtx 980ti
has it still strictly focused as a
gaming card and this is a thin for
maxwell maxwell it's very gaming focused
and that's something I'll discuss in a
moment it's also positioned to take
advantage of virtual reality displays as
they come out and of 4k and 1440
resolution monitors and to this end
there's been a bigger push to focus on
memory bandwidth and increased
processing power themes like that
looking at the core specs of the three
primary cards we're talking about today
we'll throw in the Titan X as well the
780ti had 2880 cuda cores on it when it
first shipped and three gigabytes of
video memory and this was a very
powerful card for its time the GTX 980
shipped at 2048 CUDA cores so it's about
800 fewer and had 4 gigabytes of video
memory and the 980ti has 28 16 cuda
cores 2816 with 6 gigabytes of video
memory for reference the Titan X which
is a gaming focus Titan not a dual
precision Titan has 3072 feet of course
a bit more than the 980ti and 780ti and
the Titan X also has 12 gigabytes of
video memory
make a note though that the CUDA cores
efficiency has improved greatly with
Maxwell they're about 40 percent more
efficient than on Kepler and for this
reason the 7
TI and 989 80 TI are not directly
comparable by pure numbers when looking
at core account the 780ti would be
advantaged in some applications that
care less about gaming related
technologies or technologies like delta
color compression that are definitely an
aid to bandwidth and gaming tasks but
may not be too useful when you're
dealing with things like raw encoding so
Adobe Premiere Photoshop applications
like that strive for all of the
processing power they can get their
hands on and to this end having
increased compute power would actually
be beneficial for you for gamers the
core count doesn't really matter too
much as a raw number when you're looking
between architectures because it is a
nonlinear comparison we can't look at
Fermi architecture and directly compare
core count to Maxwell for instance and
this is true for CPUs as well Intel AMD
both have different architectures from
generation to generation the gtx 980ti
has 22 streaming multi processors or SMS
and each one has 96 kilobytes of shared
memory which is a pretty big increase
over the 780 Ti which had 64 kilobytes
of shared memory the 980ti has a 176 TM
use or texture mapping units and I've
described this on the website if you're
curious what those are it's also got an
increased memory bandwidth over the gtx
980
by 50% which puts it at three hundred
thirty six point five gigabytes per
second so that's one of the more
noteworthy differences all the other
specs are on the screen the target
audience for this video card is
definitely gamers it is not meant for
users who want precision the Titan Z and
original Titan are still better for that
than even the Titan X which has 130
seconds the DP throughput of single
precision processing but for gaming we
don't really care about dual precision
in fact it can actually be a hindrance
because you're doing all this extra
processing that we don't want for a
video game it's not a simulation it's
not a scientific application so it
doesn't need that extra layer of
precision the gtx 980ti has the same GM
200 GPU that the Titan X comes equipped
with just with fewer cores they of them
are disabled and obviously it's using
less memory on the
heart itself as with all Maxwell devices
at least the second iteration of max why
for the 750ti
the architecture the technology all
that's going to be the same as what I've
discussed in the GTX 980 video in the
past and the Titan X videos and articles
Bo of the core items include things like
Delta color compression which I
mentioned previously it looks at Delta
values frame to frame temporally of the
colors presented in a game and then it
uses the Delta between those two color
values rather than an absolute this
reduces the power required to derive the
new color and rendered to the screen and
all that so it improves our efficiency
overall I'd like to make a quick note
before getting to the benchmarks that
and videos put out a lot of other news
this week as well including updates on
DirectX 12 which is Microsoft's product
of course and I don't want anyone to
confuse the fact that the DirectX 12
technologies and the gtx 980ti
are not mutually exclusive you don't
need the 980ti
to use some of the DX 12 technologies
that are being discussed this week any
DX 12 feature level 12 112 underscore
one is how its it on paper is going to
be supportive of the conservative raster
that's being discussed and of other tech
for DX 12 so you don't need a TI you can
get just the 980 just or Titan X or 970
or any other card that supports 12 for
its feature level or 12 underscore one
for the conservative raster and those
other texts and AMD will be in the same
boat as that's once they start pushing
new cards out just to quickly go over a
few of those DirectX 12 features that
Nvidia and Microsoft are talking about a
copy tags and other events conservative
raster and volume tiled resources are
the main items that are being showcased
right now volume titled resources is an
addition to the existing tiled resources
function and DirectX this adds a third
parameter to data structures when
handling game assets so that's what
volume tiled resources does it adds a
third parameter and that third parameter
can be something like volume quite
simply and this ensures that for example
visible components of a texture are
drawn to the screen but the parts that
you
Chansey aren't wasted in the GP we're
not burning resources retaining the full
texture if only a small piece of it is
used if you know what rastering is then
conservative rastering is basically just
an advancement on that for GPU
technology and this is a feature that's
not unique to the 980ti but will be
available on it rastering is when the
geometry of a game is translated into
pixels and you can see on this image
that we have here what's going on the
GPU takes samples from the middle of the
pixel and then it looks to determine
whether that sample is inside or outside
of the geometry so if you sample the
middle of the pixel and it's inside the
geometry then it's shown green in this
image and it translates into pixels with
conservative raster and it's a bit
different conservative raster and counts
any piece of geometry touching a pixel
as in the geometry so if you have a
piece of the pixel hanging in between
the geometry and outside of it but it's
sample is just barely outside of it it
will still be counted as in the geometry
and that reduces the shimmering edge of
a fine line in game by including
adjacent pixels and then filters them
appropriately talking about the
benchmarks for the 980ti we did a ton of
benchmarks there are a lot of charts I
tested 4k 1440 and 1080 for various
games with a whole suite of video cards
we excluded some of the lower end cards
because it's really not within the price
range of the TI so if you're looking at
this you don't care about like a 250 X
78572 DTI for the most part because
there are so many charts and this is so
deep I recommend that you go to the
article for the full benchmark
information if you want to see a
particular game I'll just recap it here
quickly in Metro last light at 4k with
high and high settings tessellation and
quality the 980ti performs effectively
identically to the Titan X this is
within margin of error where one FPS
away through this end if you're just
gaming and you don't care about some of
the other things that the Titan X would
be good at then you should definitely be
considering the 980ti perhaps in
opposition to the Titan X and save quite
a bit of money
the 780ti sits at 35 FPS below the 980
now there is current
a driver issue with a 7/8 700 series
cards including the 780ti where they're
underperforming that's being worked on
but either way it's clear that there is
a large gain and performance with the
980ti over the last generations card
looking at shadow of mordor on 4k we
replaced a CEO on our benchmark with
shadow of Mordor the Titan X and 980ti
again are just barely outside of margin
of error so there is a real difference
here the Titan Max is just better by a
small difference of 2 FPS and then the
980 s at 35 FPS so that's a bigger jump
it's got much lower 0.1% values as well
at 24 verses 30 and 33 1440 the Titan
axis again 2 FPS ahead of the 980ti the
980 s at 62 FPS well within playable
range and even the 780 Ti the 970 the
290x are all fine 285 s getting a bit on
the the slower side to the point where
you wouldn't be able to play for 1440
with this here's a few other charts like
Far Cry 4 grid I've got the Witcher as
well and the Witcher is worth noting we
disabled hair works anti-aliasing and
used SSAO for this right more linear
comparison with the test we've already
done which were inclusive of AMD and AMD
is not very good at tessellation so
they're not very good with hair works so
that is all for the benchmarks I'm
showing you a couple more here just in
case but do check the article linked in
the description below for the full
review including a discussion of the
architecture and things like that if
you're not familiar with it from the
previous cards the 980ti is an
interesting device it launched at $650
which makes it extremely competitive
even with NVIDIA zone Titan Max and it's
very similar to a Titan X I don't want
to say that it's basically a Titan X
because there are some core differences
literally there are fewer cores and
there's the half the vram games right
now
don't use 12 gigabytes of video RAM not
that I can find at least and very few of
them use more than for a couple will if
it's available but the performance gap
does start doing the lane depending on
which game they're testing so 6
gigabytes is ample and the core count on
the 980ti is certainly ample as well
it's
basically the same performance as the
Titan act with the games we tested and
if you're playing similar games you're
considering these two cards I would push
you hard toward the 980ti it is a
significant value game over the TX the
980 is now 500 dollars and it might be
550 after the the manufacturer changes
and that's a big enough difference where
you should still be strongly considering
a 980 as well depending on what your
budget is the ti is a good performance
gain at higher resolutions at 1080 the
980 is still a very strong card it's not
going anywhere it does fine with 1440 on
some games especially most games with
settings lowered but the 980ti is a
better performer for the higher
resolutions like 4k most definitely and
1440 at times were the 988 falls flat
and then Andy's closest competition that
I have available is the 290x they of
course have the 295x2 video card but
that is a dual GPU solution and is not
directly comparable to a single GPU
solution like the 980 TI so I'm not
going to draw those comparisons because
they're not comparable they're very
different in their execution of what
they're trying to do and I just don't
have one so I can't test it anyway the
290x is still a cheap card
I hesitate sometimes with recommending
AMD right now strictly because of the
driver the slowness of driver updates
and that's not me being mean the AMD
it's if you look at their drivers
December was the last day will update
and then they did put out a beta patch
just recently for The Witcher 3 so
that's good at least they're doing stuff
like that but at the end of the day if
you're looking at the 980 TI it's
because you're ready to spend 500 plus
dollars so I would strongly suggest
looking at these charts for the 980 TI
980 and Titan X I would say probably
eliminate the Titan X unless you have a
specific reason to buy it and I would
not be aware of that reason so that's up
to you the 980 TI is a good card for
high resolutions 980 is still very
strong even at the high resolutions but
the hundreds $150 gap is enough to make
you consider depending on how much money
you've got available for this build if
you want the the TI or the 980 and the
980 TI is very good value
happy with a card and it performs well
and then for things like premier and
Photoshop if you're mostly doing that
and not gaming then and you've got a
780ti that's still a perfectly good card
for those types of tasks and I don't
know that I'd recommend upgrading right
now unless your card sort of on its last
legs or if you could use the extra video
memory and that just depends on what
you're doing which applications you're
using you'll have to research that so
that is all for this video card check

the full article and of course if you
