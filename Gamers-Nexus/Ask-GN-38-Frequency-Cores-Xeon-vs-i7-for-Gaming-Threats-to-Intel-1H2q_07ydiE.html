of ask GN as always leave your questions
in the comment section below if you want
us to try and address the next video
also go ahead and upload some of the
questions that you like that as I've
been learning with YouTube it doesn't
really seem to necessarily impact
anything some of the questions the most
outputs were further down in the thread
so I don't really understand how the
comments here work but we'll try it out
anyway before getting to the questions
this content is brought to you by AMD
and there are X 480 and 470 video cards
in the Polaris product line you can
check out our reviews on both of those
have you're curious for more or hit the
link in the description below for sales
on these cards the first question is
from insight show who this my rephrasing
here but the question was basically at a
top level how does hyper-threading
impact or how is it added to the chip is
it a physical switch in the dye or is it
a micro code toggle of some kind what's
going on there to get hyper-threading on
something like an i7 6700 K as opposed
to a non hyper threaded CPU from Intel
so I do not know the answer to that I
reached out to Intel and send it to them
it is a good question they basically
said we will look into it and get back
to you with all the answers to your
other architecture questions that you've
asked this week so hopefully we'll have
an answer soon Intel is aware of the
question I'm thinking I'll get an answer
right around when we get some more KB
Lake information just because it'll be
all in one bundle that way
so that's on the table that's it's open
for discussion but I don't know the
answer right now my educated guess is
that it's a micro code edition of some
kind that just makes more sense to me I
don't know if there's a validation
reason or I don't think it's a physical
toggle but I could be wrong so we'll
wait for them to answer that the same
user asked how does hyper threading
affect the lifespan as in working for
new games without compromise of a CPU
how does it for example in a 2600 K
compared to an i5 6600 K those types of
differences are going to be more through
architecture and IPC and things like
that than threads necessarily but
specifically looking at the thread count
and hyper threading with older CPUs we
you see and have shown in the past some
games like Metro last light you see
better 1% 11.1% low performance in the
game when benchmark an FPS because the
extra threads do actually help but it
really is game dependent so I would say
things like frequency generally well it
depends how few cores you have but once
you kind of start hitting that four core
range frequency does have a bigger
impact in general a big generalization
but generally a bigger impact on
gameplay than more cores or more threads
but definitely extra threads helps in a
few games they're not that common
battlefield one was not one of them I
thought maybe it would be but it really
wasn't we benchmarked that metro lash
lights kind of an outlier GTA 5 shows
definitely some thread favorability
depending on how low you go on the CPU
skew list but it's a lot of massive
difference between i5 and i7 it's kind
of when you start getting lower than
that that it makes a big difference in
the low values does it does help with
lifespan of course but the gains I think
are much more limited than other things
like just overclocking your CPU next
question David do let do yet says what
do you think about the AI GPU deal
between Intel and AMD as I understand it
that's not actually confirmed by anyone
so I don't have any thoughts on it I
think that's a rumor right now I think I
talked about that on Joker's tgw show
week or two ago and it was basically at
the time was a rumor that was
popularized by Kyle Bennett apart OCP
certainly been in the industry a while
he's got some credibility behind him but
he's still the source the start in the
end of the of the statement so I really
have no thoughts or comments on it next
question I don't have this comment or
his name written down but we'll go find
and put it in the normal place our
question was basically about Xeon versus
an i7 and when it makes sense to buy one
versus the other
so Xeon CPUs are kind of a hidden secret
in system building if you're building
enthusiast
thumbs because you can often get them a
bit cheaper than an i7 and they're
mostly similar in some ways so it's it's
a good way to save some money but you do
sacrifice a bit so one example would be
well first of all Zeon's and I sevens in
the recent generations as long as you're
not going with some crazy $5,000 CPU
that really has some specific
requirements what it needs the more
equivalent to i7 Zeon's will work on the
mainstream motherboards and chipset
platforms so that makes them interesting
as a buying option and to save some
money or to the wart stock issues but
the things you sacrifice Zeon has no IGP
which is something that almost I'm sure
all of you do not care about so that's
that's one area where it's good you lose
the IGP if you already are buying a DGP
you then who cares you can use that die
space for something more important like
in the case of the Zeon higher cash and
more cash will help in production
workloads and other specific
applications rendering applications
modeling stuff like that simulation that
can help there not going to be a massive
impact to games
what will impact games more is frequency
as kind of stated a second ago and with
frequency the Zeon's tend to be lower
clocked and they're not really
overclockable in the way that an i7
whatever would be an i7 case q 6700 K
for the current generation or something
like that so some sacrifices then some
good the good is maybe a bit cheaper you
get more cash you might get more cores
and which ones you're looking at and
that could be helpful if you're building
a machine that will at least part time
double as a production system you lose
the frequency and you lose the
overclocking but if you care about
neither of those then I guess it's a
good buy but again drop in frequency
will impact gaming performance pretty
reasonably oh and the IGP which is
useless for the most part anyway other
than quick sync or something like that
next question Ricky Chon says if Andy's
Zen will flop do you think
intel jack up their prices I think
Intel's prices are probably about where
they will stay Intel's way more worried
about people like arm and Qualcomm right
now I don't know that AMD has really
posed that much of a threat in the last
few years to Intel certainly with Xen
they would pose more of a threat but I
think Intel's a lot more worried about
other competitors right now than a
desktop where they're kind of it's a
smaller market it's established and
there's not a lot of innovation and it
compared to things like mobile or server
Enterprise so I think that's where their
efforts are focused right now but in
terms of if M if it's n flops I I don't
I don't really want to speculate on that
too much because I don't like
speculating on our product will perform
before I even know how how it performs
in terms of benchmarking but you know
let's let's say that Xen doesn't do
great I don't think it's going to change
things a whole lot because the markets
already pretty heavy on Intel right now
if you look at just the market share of
Intel CPUs the only thing I only see
this going in a direction of AMD gaining
more market share or remaining the same
I don't know that they'll lose a whole
lot if they do them there's other issues
that we'll talk about at that point but
I don't I don't think that's really a
main point of concern right now so will
they increase their prices I would have
to say probably not if anything they're
going to stay the same most likely stay
the same maybe go down a little bit if
they're starting to feel some pressure
from Xen which would be a great thing
especially at the high end where you've
got Rison competing with the Broadwell
chips probably chips that would be a
good thing but now I think the answer to
that is no next question is pixel list
says dear gni overclocked my 6700 K to
4.5 gigahertz with a 1.3 5v core and I
start monitoring programs like CPU Z
voltage seems to go all the way up to
1.4 under load that's not a huge
fluctuation when I use cpuid it is
constant at one point six double-checked
BIOS and it's set to one point three
five yes so what you're seeing is it
could be a few things without knowing
your motherboard and other settings
there's a couple CPU settings in BIOS
that you should check things like a is T
and C States and there's a couple of
other OSI settings again depending
entirely on around a sixty seven hundred
K so I guess reply on z170 so you want
to check C States and things like that
generally your voltage is going to look
more variable depending on the software
you're using to monitor it so I would
recommend something like a 264 and it's
that on hardware info 64 I think both of
those are in my experience pretty
accurate with voltages I would use those
to monitor CPU Z should be accurate as
well but hardware info 64 and 8o 64 are
the two I would get and then it could be
you're looking at different voltage
values CPUs have more than one voltage
value so make sure it is actually V core
for all the software you're using to
validate because you may be looking at a
different voltage value and then the
update frequency as well for the
software could be different so if you
put two solutions next to each other two
programs on your desktop you have cpz
here and a to 64 and hardware in for 64
if they're updating at different
frequencies which some of them you can
tune like ADA you can change and some of
you can't if they update at different
frequencies then they might be three
different numbers even though they're
all presenting the data to you at the
same time they might have checked it at
a different time and so that would cause
another disparity but the CPU will also
to some extent change its voltage based
on the current need so moving from one
point three five to one point four I
would not say as is a huge deal moving
from one point three five to one point
six is a much bigger difference but I
would start with checking the software
next question smokey DAPs
says what's your guys take on FDM and 3d
printers I predict I predict a slide we
see at the new
aizen's event will include a red-black
AMD branded bracket around the processor
sample and those would be 3d printed
I've no doubt an Rd company would be
using 3d printers but how about you we
don't use them I don't have one I have
used them and I have we did one video on
3d printers several years ago at a Maker
Faire event maybe one maybe two but I
mean they're cool I don't really I don't
have a lot of thoughts on them to be
honest we kind of focus on component so
that is out of my expertise but I did
want to bring it up because the point
here that's interesting is the one about
3d printing brackets and things like
that that's something we've seen it
hasn't really taken off yet and I'm
trying to remember some of the other
places we've seen that where companies
have offered semi modular components but
that's that's attempted to be a theme
lately especially with shrouds for
different products brackets stuff like
that GPU cooling solutions I haven't
really seen a take off though headsets
as well there's been a lot of headsets
we've looked at lately at trade shows
were they one of their big points is you
could 3d print the external at your cup
cover if you wanted a logo or something
on it but it doesn't doesn't seem to
have taken off in the enthusiast market
just yet pretty cool but definitely
definitely out of my expertise last
question is from whoever that guy is
he's returned been out for at least 10
episodes now whoever this that guy is
maybe hopefully has improved since last
time says sup Steve it's been a while
anyway I installed this newest Nvidia
driver and it optimized all my neatly
tuned graphics settings how do i
optimize your hairs hairstyle that's it
for this episode of ask GN as always
leave your questions in the comment
section below
and patreon link to help us out directly
subscribe for more content we have a few
interesting things coming up this week
it's going to be a bit of a lighter week
at the end of it holidays and all that
but looking at hopefully and in when I
think it's the 805 infinity which we
showed you all
coppy types or CES or one of those shows
CES I believe you're almost a year ago
now so looking at the 805 infinity
properly and we'll be looking at some
internal solutions that I've been
building up for compressing our media
and working with an ass and stuff like
that so check back is always subscribe
for more i'll see you all next time
