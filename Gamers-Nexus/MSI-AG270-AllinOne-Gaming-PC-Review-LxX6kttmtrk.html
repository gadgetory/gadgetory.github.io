dotnet and today we're talking about
MSI's AG 270 a i/o system and all-in-one
computer that's what we're looking at
here today and in terms of core specs
this effectively uses laptop components
just mounted to a much larger display
than you'd find in a laptop so it's got
a 27-inch 10-point touchscreen display
to the back of that is mounted the
hardware and then we've got speakers in
the front so you have some speaker
capability obviously for something
higher-end you'd want your own speakers
but the idea of an all-in-one is to
eliminate as much cable clutter and as
many peripherals as possible this does
include two peripherals the keyboard and
mouse
neither which is great talk about that
momentarily and then it's got
touchscreen if you really wanted to
ditch standard peripherals but that's
going a bit extreme especially because
this is targeted at gaming and
reinforcing its target to the gaming
market is the gtx 980m eight gigabyte
mobile GPU that's our GPU the cpu is an
i7 4870 HQ which is a 2.5 gigahertz
stock CPU obviously turbos to some
extent that is one of Intel's newest
CPUs fourth generation the system has 16
gigabytes of ddr3 1600 megahertz Ram
pre-installed 1600 megahertz plenty for
most gaming applications and then in
terms of storage it's got 2 128 gigabyte
Plextor m6m SSDs these are technically
not branded in the advertising for the
specs of the unit so they could change
FM as I wanted to source a different SSD
supply but that's what they are in here
in terms of the m6m SSDs they are in a
raid that they are striped so that means
they're gonna work a bit faster than a
single Drive and also it offers 240
gigabytes of usable space to the user so
128 times to 256 you subtract out
over-provisioning and other overhead and
then we're left with 240 usable space
there is a hard drive a 2 terabyte
Seagate Barracuda 7200 rpm hard drive
and Seagate not my favorite brand in the
world they have a fairly high failure
rate at certain ranges for consumer
drives but in the case of this 2
terabyte drive it's ok we're okay with
it being used in a system like this
because just archival storage it's not
going to
as abused as your primary drives which
the SSDs are better suited for part two
of the specs would include the display
so it's a 1920 by 1080 display 27 inches
and is touchscreen enabled if you want
to ditch the touchscreen capability
unfortunately you also have the
sacrifice that SSDs MSI has three
versions of this unit available this one
$2,700
they have about a $2,500 version which
is probably slightly lower but you down
the clock the skew of the the CPU to a
slightly lower skew of Intel CPUs still
perfectly fine for most gaming
applications and then further below that
is the $2,000 version which has no
touchscreen so that saves you a lot of
money but also no SSDs and that's a big
hit to me as a gamer that's definitely
something I want and a system at this
point is SSDs especially in an
all-in-one system and as an all-in-one
it is meant for use in a living room
environment in a common area environment
and that means that you want SSDs
because you want it to boot quickly be
accessible and then sort of get it over
with shut it down they're also a lot
quieter at 2700 dollars it's a steep buy
it's a little bit hard to swallow and as
system builders we're used to paying a
little bit less and getting more but
this is not targeted at us as system
builders it's targeted at users who want
something that is fairly easy to deploy
this is gonna be for people who are in a
family environment where you just sort
of deployed it in the living room and be
done with it and it also eliminates
cable clutter behind the system so
that's a plus it's fairly quiet because
it does use laptop components and that's
sort of what you're looking at here and
then of course aesthetics and
cohesiveness of design not really my
territory I don't like talking about
those things so just take a look at it
yourself decide for yourself if you like
how it looks and I'm gonna stick with
the objective items so we're talking and
primarily about things like thermals
gaming performance and we'll go from
there
in terms of thermals you can see here
that the system has a fairly standard
thermal design for laptops but it's been
beefed up a little bit so we have three
massive 10 millimeter heat pipes and
that a smaller six or eight millimeters
I'm not entirely sure which it is six or
eight millimeters for the other heat
pipe here the heat pipes as always are
routed between the CPU the GPU and
the aluminum plates where they're synced
to the aluminum heat sinks where they
dissipate the heat and the way a heat
pipe works this is not news for this a
IO is how they all work but just to
recap it is they use a phase change to
dissipate heat pretty rapidly so
basically you've got copper heat pipes
made entirely of copper and then they
have a small channel in the middle where
there is a sintered or a weave or a mesh
a set of other metal normally copper
also and there's liquid in there the
liquid flows through the heat pipe and
so at the end where the component is the
CPU or the GPU the component heats it up
that turns the liquid into a gas that's
a phase change and when you go through
any type of phase change liquid to a gas
you're burning a lot of energy you lose
a ton of energy in that phase change in
this case we want to lose energy because
energy is in the form of heat and that's
dissipating the heat so it turns into a
gas goes to the other end of the heat
pipe and then condenses and turns back
to liquid comes back down it's just
capillary action if you're familiar with
that that's how heat pipes work so
that's the basics of a heat pipe once it
gets to the end and begins condensing
again that's where the heat sink is
that's where the big aluminum or copper
heat sinks it's dissipates the heat then
that gets blown away by a fan and that's
the end of the cycle so that's how a
heat pipe works in terms of this design
three ten millimeter pipes is pretty big
that's about what some of the high-end
video cards have and because this is a
27 inch display we're not constricted to
the same confines that a laptop would
present so we've got more space to
spread out the components and MSI did
just this they actually use a slightly
larger more standard form factor
motherboard rather than the traditional
very cramped and sometimes custom laptop
motherboards so this lets the CPU and
GPU be distance further from each other
which means that they all the heat isn't
concentrated in one place so we can
dissipate it more quickly thermals of
the system as you see in this charge are
actually very good they're definitely
acceptable this is not a delta over
ambient chart so it's absolute
temperatures and to get Delta U just if
you want to do it sort of in your head
subtract 21 Celsius at all times from
the chart that gives you the Delta but
the important bit here is that whenever
there's a big
spike-like to 9dc which would be 70c
subtracting ambiens you see a pretty
quick cooldown it dissipates very
quickly the CPU and GPU regulate
themselves well they throttle when
necessary and then the fans just spin up
when necessary as well and that's sort
of where the dissipation is going in
terms of thermals I'm impressed with the
AI oh definitely happy with thermal
performance this chart shows the gaming
performance of the AG 270 a IO as you
can see pretty much expected for the
980m basically the same as our cyber
power and origin laptop reviews where we
worked with the 980m as well performance
is very good for games you can play
pretty much everything that high to
ultra so that's always great and then
some games like The Witcher 3 you
definitely have to step it down a bit
too high or medium for playable settings
power draw is pretty minimal it only
draws 230 watts from the AC drop to the
wall there's no internal power supply so
you're strictly plugging straight into a
wall just like a laptop would but
there's no battery so you're drawing 230
watts there under full load and really
not that bad not much to complain about
in that instance and one thing that is
kind of cool is a paint program skinned
by MSI and the paint program offers some
fun with a touchscreen it's certainly
not coral paint or Photoshop or any
professional application where you would
be doing something with tablet painting
with a stylus but it is fun to play with
and for a system that's probably
targeted I like the family gamers that's
okay it's okay to have something fun to
play around with now that said that's
really the whole experience of the
touchscreen it's really not something I
found to be practically useful because
for extended periods of use holding your
arms up like this is actually really
difficult to tap a screen like this for
more than a few minutes and I'm sure you
can all leave your comments making find
a weak nerd arms below but that's just
the nature of the situation and it's not
really the most accurate screen anyway
it's not like there's pressure
sensitivity for for really accurate
artistic scenarios so if you're an
artist it's still in your best interest
to buy a proper artists tablet this is
definitely a gaming system with a
touchscreen thrown onto it so if the
touchscreen is worth it to you that's up
to you to me
not a big feature draw i'd rather
sacrifice the touchscreen reduced cost
and keep the SSD so i want an in-between
skew they included audio is decent you
can see at least it looks like four
speakers in the front right above the
acrylic and there's not much bass so
it's a bit tinny but it's loud and that
actually does matter because with laptop
components i've often had the issue
where they're so quiet that I have
trouble I actually need headphones
because I can't hear them that is not
the case here it is a loud speaker set
up a bit tinny
sure but that's what you get when you're
trying to eliminate speaker clutter and
all the peripherals if you're okay with
peripherals and with speakers being on
the desk definitely look into buying
them this has no base whatsoever I would
love it if MSI would investigate adding
a subwoofer to the back panel of this
display similar to like what they've
done with the GT 72 I believe their
laptop the only massive gripe I have
with this would be the keyboard and
mouse that are included and I have a
feeling that MSI is already aware of
this issue because almost every user
review and other professional review
complain about these two items right
here the problem with the keyboard it's
more like the sort of scissor switch
type setup that laptops have sometimes
these are okay in the case of this one
the actuation depth is is so picky that
I have a lot of trouble typing on it my
words per minute drops to about 70 I
normally type it about 120 on a
mechanical or a decent membrane keyboard
so definitely a big impact on typing
that is a functional impact and it's got
some key layout things I don't like I
discuss in the article really not a fan
of the keyboard it's pretty cheaply made
and doesn't feel great for the 2700
dollars that you spend the mouse was
tracking on its own I originally thought
it was an issue with the touchscreen
resultant of the previous reviewer who
had the unit but it's actually it was
just the mouse was sort of tracking on
its own when no one was touching it so
not a great mouse not a great keyboard
I sort of wish MSI would either just
include something good or not at all
because as a consumer it feels like I'm
spending money on things that are gonna
be thrown away and replaced so I'd
rather just have a slightly lower cost
when I'm buying it passed on to the
buyer then have useless components
or they could include something better
so when would you buy an all-in-one
computer well for a lot of us who DIY
it's not really the best option because
you could build your own system you can
even build it in an SFF box if you don't
have something really small and then
spend $500 on a touchscreen if you
really wanted that it would probably be
cheaper be slight bit more powerful and
really you have more control over it
when things start to go wrong so it's
not for us necessarily who it is for
would be the user who wants to buy
something that works out of the box and
you can sort of set up and be done with
it
it's one thing one piece of hardware
plus the peripherals that be the mouse
and keyboard and then it's over it also
offers a compact nough sub design so
although a 27-inch display is large you
don't need the desktop sitting around on
the desk or below the desk and this can
also help with dust management things
like that it's fairly quiet and there's
no cable clutter so no cables behind the
display and no really cables inside that
are going to be any kind of hassle
because you'll never need to open it
anyway at thirty pounds this is not
portable so it might be deceptively
portable in that it's one thing to carry
around but it's very heavy and somewhat
unwieldy the acrylic stand on the back
doesn't offer the best viewing angles of
the display so I hope amis I can find a
solution to that the viewing angles are
a bit rough if you're seated lower than
the displays because you can't really
turn it down to you because of the way
it basically just tilts like that so
obviously you'd only go for so far
before it tilts forward and bad things
happen and at $2,700 it's really not an
unfair amount of money for the hardware
that's in here if you look at comparable
laptops and then add the cost of a
touchscreen so where we're getting
killed on price is the touchscreen
remove that keep all the other hardware
or word buy the cheaper two thousand
dollar version and add your own SSDs
they are definitely possible to add to
yourself a bit of effort and the price
is okay it's agreeable but still pretty
painful because you're on the two grand
plus range and at that point you needs
to determine you know what I'd rather
have a laptop and monitor that I can
just
in the laptop places and plug it in when
I'm home and dock it or would I rather
DIY if I'm capable of that
or do I want this and the reason you
want this is because it looks a certain
way it's compact in design and there's
no cable clutter so that's really all it
comes down to the cons within a i/o are
pretty obvious if one piece of the
system goes just like with a laptop the
whole thing goes you can probably get
someone to work on it work on yourself
and replace the mobile components but
there's only so far that will get you so
cons and pros very well defined just as
with the laptop and check the article
for more information on this hopefully
this helps you make some decision on
your own I can only do so much for you
but the FPS charts and the thermals that
look very good the price is just a bit
painful and the component selection with
the touchscreen not a big fan of the
touchscreen just because it drives the
cost up so much and then the keyboard
mouse not great either the rest of it
not bad in terms of performance and big
fan of the thermal performance check out
our patreon page if you like this type
of coverage it's a big help huge shout
out to warren and icon Rob the others
who have supported us so far I've
