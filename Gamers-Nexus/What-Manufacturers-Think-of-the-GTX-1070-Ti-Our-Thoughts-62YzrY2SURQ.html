manufacturers think of mining
cryptocurrency mining we're back now to
talk about what some of the
manufacturers we've spoken with think of
the 1070 TI these are obviously
anonymized answers and opinions from
various people in the industry
keeping it anonymous is one requirement
for obvious reasons but - it allows
people to speak their mind a bit more
freely after these thoughts and opinions
we'll go through some more of my own
following the 1070 TI review our review
has really just focused on getting the
numbers out there and getting through
that phase and now we can talk a bit
more expanding on the conclusion of the
review and talking about the cards
existence as a whole before that this
video is brought to you by thermal
Grizzly makers of the conductor not
liquid metal that we recently used to
drop 20 degrees off of our coffee lake
temperatures thermal grizzly also makes
traditional thermal compounds we use on
top of the IHS like cryo not and hydro
not pastes learn more at the link below
let's start with the facts and what we
know from the ABI partners what they've
told us so this one is pretty widespread
and recognized at this point we've been
talking about it for a few weeks now but
just to really confirm for everyone
there are no pre overclocked 1070 t is
under Nvidia's dictation so this is a
rule that was put in place on the board
partners we've spoken with them they you
could look at their product listings and
confirm it yourself they can't make a
pre overclocked model they all ship at
reference clocks there's a way to cheat
this rule and get around it and that is
to basically ship the card with an
option to download and install software
separate from the driver and then use
that software to apply a pre-configured
overclocked state it would be
functionally equivalent to a pre
overclocked just you have to download
and install more bloatware this is
definitely a sub optimal way of doing it
and the problem is the people who
generally need a pre overclocked done
for them rather than
manually are probably the same people
who won't know that there is software
won't download it or whatever but that's
one way to get around the rule of no pre
overclocks they're able to ship software
to do it another thing here so speaking
with the board partners off the record
we were generally given the impression
that the the board partners definitely
think that the 1070 TI sales will be
impacted by the lack of pre overclocks
and this is because there is less
differentiation between cards the
differentiation in clocks obviously is
not there so now you're left with
coolers and a lot of the market not
probably not ninety percent of you but
you have to remember that outside of our
bubble of enthusiasts space there's a
much wider audience and a lot of that
market isn't gonna look for things like
thermals and noise they will go to
Newegg they're gonna click compare on
five different products and then look at
the base and boost clocks and whatever
other numbers are there whether or not
they understand them and determine okay
this one's got a higher number and it's
this price and so relative to the others
it's probably better for me and that's
completely a fine way to buy things
that's how everyone pretty much starts
but that plays into this because the
1070 TI all those numbers are gonna be
the same so you're left with cooler and
noise differences which very few people
test and even fewer people care about so
that's from the board partner
perspective speaking with them the lack
of differentiation is kind of a big deal
and will probably impact on seventy TI
sales another note from board partners
and sort of speaking with everyone
generally there was frustration over the
pre overclocked lockdown by nvidia but
also generally the follow up to that was
what are you gonna do you have no option
so you play you know you have to do what
Nvidia says if you're gonna sell their
product and that's really the start in
the end of it the more expensive cooler
designs now speaking with the board
partners have less apparent value than
they would otherwise and they raise the
of the final product in terms of the
Bill of Materials without creating an
obvious to consumer increase in
performance
so most people again who don't think
about thermals and noise will see the
extra $20 $30 whatever it is on top of
MSRP and it might not register as an
actual advantage because if that cooler
isn't being leveraged to cool a pre
overclock better than something like a
reference card could do when you look at
noise normalized thermal performance
then the benefit isn't realized not
until the user either manually applies
an overclock or purchase or down
purchase as a card with downloadable
software to do it for them and again the
audience ultimately even though we do
cater to it the audience that cares
about things like manual overclocking is
quite small so that's definitely a big
deal this one is really not a surprise
to anyone so everyone we spoke with
pretty much agreed that this move of the
1070 Ti is more to hamstring the Vega 56
sales than anything else it's something
that we talked about in our review we
talked about it before the review and
came out I think yeah it's not a
surprise because it's not a surprise
that Nvidia would compete with their
competitor so it's not a surprise then
that and video would try to do something
in response to Vega 56 I don't think
anyone's questioning that what's kind of
weird is just the the lock downs on the
pre overclock this is me speaking at
this point and the it's it's really just
the ham straining the partner is more
than anything and if you think about it
of course it's to create product
segmentations pretty normal and that's
not necessarily a good thing but it's
pretty normal it's just that this type
of product segmentation is new even for
nvidia who already have pretty limited
overclocking utilities available to them
comparatively so it's a response to Vega
56 but also Nvidia is try not to fight
their 1080 sales and speaking again with
the vendors going back to what they were
saying
so we asked we asked everyone we spoke
with do you think the 1070 TI or the
1080
will remain more popular and because you
look at them going back to our review
the 1070 TI when overclocked
particularly does encroach on 1080
territory to the point where with the
exception of shader intensive games like
sniper it really doesn't make a ton of
sense to by 1080 if you're willing to
overclock a 1070 ti
even an overclocked 1080 they're really
not that different there couple single
digit percentage points so we asked do
you think the 1070 Ti will outsell you
or 1080 and most of them said that the
well there's a couple different answers
here actually these we have four
different sources all with slightly
different answers so I'll just go
through them sort of anonymized one was
the 1080 will still have its brand
presence and recognition because the the
number 80 in end video series cards does
carry a fair bit of weight so from that
perspective of a consumer looking from
the outside of the enthusiast bubble in
at product options 1080 still sounds
like the better option and I guess
technically it is because there's no pre
overclocked n7 easy eyes and technically
in a lot of ways it is superior and so
far as its objective performance it's
just a question of is it superior in
terms of price to performance and things
like that
when you account for overclocking but I
see yes one source did say the 1080
still carries enough sort of weight with
its name that they didn't think the
sales would be too ably impacted another
thought that the gtx 1070 would be them
actually two of them thought that the
gtx 1070 would be the most affected
product in the stack where it's it'll
move lower volume specifically because
the 1070 TI just ignoring Vega from the
equation the 1070 TI was thought of as
stealing 1070 sales more than anything
else and then we also had the answer
that it's going to depend on price where
1070 TI cards that are closer to 500
dollar marks and this is from a board
partner although it's kind of obvious
closer to 500 dollars not a lot of point
to buy them you might as
by 1080 and I think everyone recognizes
hat board partners recognize that when
asked what review samples we want from
all the different manufacturers pretty
much everyone agrees that things closer
to 500 dollars are not going to get as
good of a review in terms of price of
performance because why would they if
you can spend 5 10 or 5 20 and get a
1080 which is again technically superior
then you should just buy that but the
theta is the 1070 Ti does have a bit of
an argument for it when it's less
significantly less like $50 $70 less
than a 1080 that's when it comes into
play so everyone's in agreement that the
$500 cards are going to be a much harder
sell I think that goes through most of
the board partner thoughts I have some
of my own I've two or three more notes
here that are quick generally sensing
frustration with the board partners over
the pre overclocked lockdown probably
not surprising that it does sort of eat
into what the board partners offer as a
service for consumers and then everyone
also basically agreed there's nothing
they can really do about it you have to
play by Nvidia's rulebook because it's
their GPU so the best they can do is
play tricks with software game modes one
click buttons things like that oh one
other note one of the partners we spoke
with the this didn't affect everyone but
specifically one partner we spoke with
did have to rename a product before
coming to market with it pretty late in
the cycle allegedly and the product
rename was I think because they might
have had the letters OC and the product
name or some other synonym for
overclocked and that clearly doesn't
affect everyone because you can look at
the product stack and people still have
pretty much the same names they've
always had but a couple companies
apparently did have to consider renaming
things because they weren't allowed to
be over lock it it makes sense why would
you tack the letters OC onto it if it's
not actually overclocked so my thoughts
on this opinions on the whole of the
market this
goes beyond the 1070 TI this year we had
AMD Vega come out and it's got a lock to
be BIOS you can flash Vega 64 signed
BIOS on 256 and you can't flash a fee on
to it we tried that didn't quite well
can't flash a fee on to it at least with
any changes I haven't tried it since
then but once you start changing BIOS at
all even the name of the BIOS it doesn't
work you can't flash custom BIOS on to
there so I am the Institute of that
change and it was a big change and in
the overclocking community it's not been
well-received you have people like
builds ahead who I remember and I worked
with him on it he was just genuinely
genuinely seemed I use the phrase let
down because I don't want to speak for
him but it did seem like in the xoc
community in general is like okay now we
have to figure out an alternative and
even on our end we're not EXO Sears or
anything but on our end it comes down to
how do we get around these limitations
and it's gonna be things like power play
tables and stuff like that which work
but not as not as a good of an option as
a custom v bios so Andy had that change
where they lock down parts of
overclocking for a reason that seemed
like it wasn't really an actual reason
to do it it was apparently for us a
secure boot thing but that's not
actually a requirement from what we
understand now as for Nvidia they're
doing this their own way they haven't
instituted any overclocking restrictions
on users for the 1070 TI it works the
same as it always has
there's nothing special here there are
OC limitations on the board partner so
that's a bit different new and it's
obviously for segmentation and to try
and split the stack up so that the 1080
doesn't just completely die the because
a concerning point I would like people
to pay attention to is that I'm a little
worried that going forward with new GPU
architectures and things we may see
similar practices with overclocking and
overclocking is a lot
fun it can get you some more performance
sometimes a whole lot more performance
it doesn't need to be practical and it
generally isn't once you start going
crazier with it but that's not really
the point either the point is you've got
the option and it's fun to do and a lot
of it's you buying these expensive video
cards probably to have fun whether
that's playing a game or from the
enthusiasts aspect of building a
computer and then tuning it and doing
cool things and learning that's kind of
the whole point so I am a little
concerned about the trend from both and
the end Nvidia and hopefully we don't
see a continued block down on
overclocking I would just ask that
everyone kind of keep your eyes open and
let us know if you see any further
actions like this but in the very least
of 1070 TI is user overclockable and we
got it quite far actually we made it
easily outperform at 1080 and basically
matches an overclocked 1080 depending on
Silicon lottery but yeah I don't know
it's a very Apple like play from both of
them it's an apple like played log beat
BIOS this is old news now we've talked
about it already it's definitely an
Apple hike play to put restrictions on
manufacturers to the point where it's
kind of like what's your endgame here
Nvidia leh is it gonna be focusing more
on founders edition cards with different
cooler designs in the future cuz this if
they're all gonna be the same reference
and base and boost clocks the only
reason not to buy this is the cooler so
at some point you would start wondering
is Nvidia going to try and compete with
its partners more directly but that's
all just really speculation at this
point and more stuff to keep an eye on
than anything else but yeah that's
that's front half thoughts from the
manufacturers about 10 70 TI back half
just an extension of our review as far
as performance just kind of revisit this
very briefly if you want the performance
metrics check the review but very
briefly the 1070 Ti is in a position
once again where it handily outperforms
the 10 7
generally outperforms Vega 56 depends on
the title and can be made to outperform
at 1080 or perform equally with an
overclocked 1080 all of this in mind
depending on the price it might be a
better bhai then the 1080 at this point
so again we go back to the point I was
making in the review of is it the 1080
that doesn't make sense or the 1070 ti
that doesn't make sense one of them
loses market share here it's just a
question of which one is it and as close
to $450 as possible the 1070 TI seems
like it's potentially a good product to
work with if you're gonna overclock it
the minute you start increasing the
price 10 20 $30 at that point especially
$30 it is sort of looking like you
should just buy 1080
now the big question here that we didn't
discuss in the review is well you know
it sounds like there's not a lot of room
between the prices we talked about that
but why couldn't Nvidia just drop the
price of the 1080 down to functionally
1070 TI prices even four hundred seventy
dollars or something like that and
technically speaking the 1080 has been
available for around that price in the
past it was before the mining craze that
ruined all GPU prices but it was
available around that price so that's I
think that's why the 1070 TI feels a
little bit it seems like it's gotten a
pretty pretty negative reaction from the
community in general you look at all the
comments and they're mostly like why
does this card need to exist and it's
fair point because the 1080 could have
been dropped in price and that would be
crazy competitive but I think looking at
it sort of from Nvidia's perspective
where your goal is to compete with AMD
on V 56 and beat them which the 1080
could do in terms of performance but
maybe not as much price that they could
try I think from their perspective it's
less about let's get a card into this
price
bakit to compete with vega 56 and more
about let's get a card that gets
visibility and we talked about this in
the review and change the discussion so
that when people are talking about what
card do I buy between 350 and 450
dollars or $500 let's say make it a big
range
it changes the discussion so that now
instead of Vega 56 versus 1070 its 1070
TI versus 1080 or 1070 TI versus 1070
and Vega 56 is in there a little bit but
the fact that it's got three three while
two long-standing heavily reviewed
products and then one brand new one that
just breached the product cycle and is
making a lot of rounds on everywhere I
think having those 3 cards flanking Vega
56 takes away some of the spotlight from
it and that's further expanded by the
lack of Vega 56 partner cards even 64
but we're just looking at 56 today the
lack of partner cards and general
limited supply although prices have come
down at least temporarily to around MSRP
lack of those the supply and partner
card doesn't really help it's it's got
no backup the reference card is just out
there so low again it's now a huge wave
of 1070 TI is that obviously get
coverage and they should but huge wave
of that and then 10 80s are now being
discussed once again for the first time
in like six months
so I think it again I think it was a
strategic play I've just had more time
to think about it now and talk to
manufacturers so it was worth revisiting
once again as an addendum to the review
but yeah you can watch the review if you
want to know which card to buy we have
the numbers there for you I don't really
make a firm statement on a global scale
of what I think you should buy but I
have a few statements in the review
of when Cartier makes more sense than
card be in certain conditions so
hopefully that helps you as for Vega
whether or not those prices stay and I
don't suspect that they will they are
low right now so if you can find me if
you've wanted Vega 56 for a long time
now you better buy it probably soon
because I think after this this wave of
1070 TI cards starts losing coverage and
just sort of falling back on the cycle
I think Vega 56 will at least go back up
a little bit in price because there are
some there's some incentive there for it
to be cheaper right now but either way
it's still a reference card the
reference card from both Nvidia and AMD
they both suck and we've been clear on
that for years now so if you want to buy
it be aware of that and consider like a
Morpheus or a hybrid mod we have a guide
where we did a hybrid mod do something
like that with it and you'll be in
pretty good shape but as for the 1070
1070 TI and 1080 we've got plenty of
