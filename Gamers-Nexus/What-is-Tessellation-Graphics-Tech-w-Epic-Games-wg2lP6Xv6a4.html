Nexus tonight we are at the epic Game
Studios in Cary North Carolina and I'm
joined by Alan Willard senior technical
artist at Epic Games and Alan can you
give us a sort of quick overview of the
types of things you work on here at epic
well I'm a technical artist so I work on
all sorts of stuff it depends on the
needs of the project for the Gears games
I did some levels I did cars that you
could blow up I did particle systems I
did some sound stuff for Unreal
Tournament as well as levels so a
technical artist is kind of the
jack-of-all-trades we end up kind of
getting pulled onto various things as
fires break out or as new projects start
up to help kind of define how things are
gonna work can you give us a top level
overview what is tessellation where do
gamers actually see it in use sure so if
you think of your average surface
whether it's a floor or a wall we build
them out of what we call quads which are
really two triangles that are butted up
together to make a square tessellation
is a way of doubling that on the
graphics hardware so what was two
triangles becomes four becomes eight
sixteen and so on and when we do that
that allows us to do things like
displacement or smoothing and increase
the apparent detail not only making the
surface look higher resolution but also
adding bumps and hills and valleys that
weren't there before so you get a much
higher fidelity surface what what was
the origin of tessellation as it
pertains to epic games when did it first
get implemented so near the end of our
active development on Unreal Engine 3 we
did the Samaritan demo and we added
tessellation working with NVIDIA and you
can see it in the Samaritan demo when
the character becomes very kind of
armored and rocky we increase the amount
of tessellation on the character and
then added a displacement map and that
displacement is what takes his default
shape and enhances it to get that kind
of angular rocky look so going forward
if if I'm a gamer I'm playing some kind
of modern game and I
enable or disable tessellation in the
settings where should I be looking to
see the most immediate visual impact
so mostly it'll be in the silhouettes of
things right if you have a boulder and
it looks fairly low poly without
tessellation when you turn on
tessellation you'll start to see more
curvature it will get smoother small
things like bumps and gouges will start
to become more apparent not just looking
straight at it but also in the outline
around the object is this dependent upon
the camera angle it can be it depends on
the implementation we tend to bias the
displacement and tessellation based on
camera distance right if you have a
small object in its way far away you
really don't want to spend any
performance doing anything extra to it
until it comes close enough to the
camera that it's it now important to the
the players eye right there's no point
in wasting time on it and an earlier
example we were talking about just
pre-interview when looking at a flat
surface like a wall with a brick texture
on it so my understanding is that
tessellation can help give this an
appearance of depth right so if you
think of a wall as just being a flat
surface you can do a lot of shader
tricks to make it look better what we
call bump offset where we shift the
location of pixels based on the camera
angle and that can give you the sense
that the bricks have depth and and and
are coming out of the surface a bit but
what you'll never get is you'll never
get a silhouette off of that kind of
technique so displacement and
tessellation allow us to increase the
triangle density and then actually push
and pull those triangles in out to the
sides whatever to get those shapes to
really come off of that surface and then
lighting and shadowing can can really
work with those shapes too to sell the
final look call on a performance side
what's sort of the the performance
impact here is it is it large or it
depends on the GPU displacement and
tessellation are typically done
completely on the GPU so if the the
project or the game that you're looking
at is GPU bound where they're doing all
the work that can be done on the GPU
while staying within their performance
boundaries then turning tests
off we'll get you some performance
improvements games do typically tend to
be GPU bound we all want our games to
look as good as possible so we turn on
all the bells and whistles so unless
you're you're running on an extremely
high-end machine you'll notice some
difference in performance but as you do
get into the higher-end spec it'll just
enhance the look without any significant
performance cost very cool so for more
information on tessellation check the
link in the description below for the
full article and any any projects we're
talking about here today just to direct
people towards new things obviously
there's the Unreal Engine which we've
released for free to everyone you can
download it at Unreal Engine comm create
your own projects we've got massive
amount of tutorial content
demonstrations we have a learn tab in
our launcher that lets you get right in
and see how we're building stuff we have
weekly trip twitch streams covering
everything from our community for
tonight information Unreal Tournament
information which is available through
the launcher tab as a pre-alpha you can
download it play the game right now and
if you're so inclined you can even get
in and start working on it you can
actually build content and make it part
of the game right from your home very
cool so again links in the description
below for more information and we will
see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
