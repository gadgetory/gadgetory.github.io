Nexus net and today we're going to do
another heat signature this is a belated
heat signature as I announced on our
Facebook page I had to push it back for
some really awesome updates that are
coming but that said we just got back
from pax east last weekend and I just
really awesome videos up from the
concert so check that out if you are
interested in that sort of thing today
we're going to talk about vertex though
which is a true indie game it has been
promoted on take source on the
independent gaming discussion forums and
it is as I said a true independent game
meaning that it's not really right now
there is a pretty complete demo out it
is not commercial right now I don't know
if he has plans to make it commercial
but it is a free demo with plenty of
maybe two or three hours of gameplay the
game takes inspiration from Super
Metroid spelunky and Cave Story as the
developer has said as well as plenty of
other game from the credits many of them
from the NES and SNES era is a pretty
challenging a platformer I guess you
could say it is an RPG platform of it
very much like the old NES games with
that said it does take in a couple of
new elements from other games that have
been out recently so let's go and talk
about those it is based in AI there's a
somewhat of a backstory it's based
around at the vertex which is a large
sort of futuristic structure that has
been overtaken by bad guys and we are
part of the faction that controls the
vertex but unfortunately we lost it to
the the enemies that invaded so now it
is our objective to eventually I would
suppose gain the vertex back although
that much of the game hasn't necessarily
been revealed yet so that's all just
back story though the real point of the
game is to kill institue explore and
generally adventure this is an action
adventure platformer style game you have
your basic inventory with different
items you can equip you have multiple
characters that you switch between at
any point in the game it's not it is a
is not a turn-based combat so you play
as one character you hop around and if
you want to you can hit C to switch to a
more advantageous character for the
position you're in for example in the
demo I have so far I mark the main
character of course you start with and
his advantage as he can go stealth in
the shadows if you stay still for a few
seconds
which is very good for getting the drop
on those more powerful enemies now of
course all of these enemies just patrol
like in the original platformers it's
not like they're going hunting for you
but still very useful the first
unlockable character is a ranger type
with a double jump so you'll find
yourself switching to her pretty
frequently when you are trying to get
from place to place or just trying to
access new areas and that is one of the
things that vertex does extremely well
and even though it is just a demo like I
said so all of this is subject to change
but it does restrict access to different
areas by requiring that you have certain
characters or items so it's not just
like a sign that says you can't go here
or an invisible wall you physically
cannot access it and you know
immediately it's not like there's any
question at all you know immediately
okay I must need something to get here
and then you go out and search for it's
very compelling gameplay and it's very
fluid so it's not like there's ever a
moment of doubt or question we were
trying to think did I miss something
because you you most certainly know that
you've missed something if you did not
come out of that previous area with some
with some kind of significant advantage
or ability to access newer areas and all
of the areas are staged off of one
central point of gathering so far and
those are all seen right away so you
know okay I need an access card to get
to this tower I need some kind of higher
jumping ability to get to this area over
on the right and for the warp gate on
the left i know i can access that
immediately so obviously i'll go through
there and then explore that level until
i find something to either an access
card or a higher jump and that's pretty
much the flow of the game play in terms
of your thought process it is as I said
based off of Super Metroid and some
other games of that era so in terms of
elements we see from that it is a
fast-paced platformer there is some
pretty decent combat even though it's
you know it's a platform it's pretty
simple there's just a shoot and then a
jump and running and all that but the
boss battles I found extremely
challenging I did figure out after a
little while what the trick is as with
all of these games there's a somewhat of
a trick to defeat the bosses which
basically in the long run a cup is just
running backwards or jumping over
bullets or stuff like that the boss did
the one that I thought initially did
have a couple of different attacks
which meant I had to learn a couple of
different ways to evade those attacks
and stay alive checkpoints are very well
placed so if you die which you
definitely will you don't have to redo a
whole bunch of the level but they're not
placed so commonly that it's like newer
games where it's holding your hand you
actually do have a little bit of a
punishment in terms of time loss when
you die so for other features there is a
central town where you can go there is a
shop so you can buy different items like
healing kids or your stuff of that sort
of different increased accuracy
increases attack power all of those
kinds of basic items and you just buy
them there one time uses for the most
part and can buy them what the coins
that you get from killing things or you
can buy them with orbs that you find
hidden through different areas and with
that said that it's hidden areas in this
game are very well scattered it's pretty
easy to find them so it's not like be
you're not going to spend hours of your
time trying to find every single niche
in the game which is actually extremely
aggravating to me because I always feel
like I have to complete a game a hundred
percent but this game marks them with a
couple of well-placed flowers or
crystals or other stuff of that variety
so that you know where it is but you
still have to look around in that
general area it's not like it shows you
exactly where so that is pretty much all
of the key points for this demo is the
final version of the public demo so I
expect the full game will come pretty
soon it's made by I moose on the tig
forums or tick source forums and the
game does currently have five major
areas to quote his list a couple of
minor areas and secret areas numerous
boss battles original sound music and
graphics which are all really good by
the way they definitely have the great
older 8-bit aesthetic to them and they
flow very well the music is great as
well so hopefully you will hear all that
and if you download the demo it's only
forty megabytes it has two to three
hours of gameplay and a working
inventory in shop where you can equip
different items to your characters to
make them more powerful the Creator also
has a great sense of humor so there's
some pretty funny things scattered
throughout their definitely go download
it and enjoy that it is a free demo
forty megabytes I will have a couple
more videos up this week hopefully one
will talk about legend of grimrock if my
schedule works out and I also plan to do
a video on how to replace the the 4-pin
molex connectors on a power supply so
that is definitely not game
related but it is harbour related so for
our readers out there that like hardware
you will have that to look forward to i
will talk to you guys next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
