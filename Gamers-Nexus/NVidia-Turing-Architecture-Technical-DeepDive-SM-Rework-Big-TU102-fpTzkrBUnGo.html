first major architecture launch in about
two years since 2016 and the Pascal
launch and today we're going to be going
through a deep dive of the touring
architecture so this includes how things
are set up architecturally we're talking
about G pcs TBC's SM layout which has
changed by the way going over why those
things exist why are there GPC is why
are there T pcs and then we're also
talking about RT X the SDK and how
Nvidia's ray-tracing solution works
other things that can be applied to in
games if it's even useful in games and
things like that also one more thing big
touring because the 2080 TI is not
actually the biggest one that they can
make before that this video is brought
to you by Thermal Grizzlies high-end
thermal paste and liquid metal thermal
Grizzlies cryo not is an affordable high
quality thermal compound that doesn't
face some of the aging limitations of
other pastes on the market cryo not has
a thermal conductivity of 12.5 watts per
meter Kelvin focuses on endurance is
easy to spread and isn't electrically
conductive making it safe to use on GPU
dies thermal grizzly also makes
conductor not liquid metal which we've
used to drop 20 degrees off some
temperatures than our dee-lighted tests
by a tube at the link in the description
below so this is not a review yet we
can't post them yet don't go out and buy
cards don't pre-order cards we'll be
reviewing them soon enough but today
we're just focusing strictly on
architecture discussion and hopefully
not much else let's start with a quick
overview of the major changes to taurine
versus Pascal so the number one thing
before we dive deeper into all the rest
of the architecture is that as the
supplies to gaming one of torian's
biggest benefits theoretically is rate
racing and what they call r-tx the SDK
this is sort of an extension of game
works you can think of it as a similar
idea of being an SDK that's provided to
developers who make the decision of
whether or not they're implementing
different options from that SDK but in
trying to summarize its own performance
and Vidya created a new metric that they
called r-tx
ops so this is where Nvidia got into
territory that they realized they have
these tensor cores RT cores typical FP
30
- in 32 new concurrent processing of FP
32 and 32 and DNN capabilities and
someone in marketing realized that
actually the 2080 Ti and the 2080
strictly in terms of teraflops for FP 32
don't look all that much better than the
10 series on paper so what do we do to
make it look better and the answer was
to invent a new metric of measurement so
Nvidia invented this new r-tx
ops as a means to quantify the
performance of its tensor processors
it's RT cores typical FP 32 and 32
performance and all this stuff because
again it'll it'll make things look a lot
better than perhaps they might have
otherwise and that's the core of it now
there could be some legitimacy to this
in that yes creating a weighted metric
is required when there is no existing
metric for measuring all these things
but also it's a geforce card and the
weighting is a built on a perfect model
that might not apply to gaming scenarios
so that getting into this this is the
interesting part for this formula RTX
ops you may have heard is it comes out
to being about 78 RT x ops on the 28 e
TI versus 11.3 on the 10 80 TI this
number on paper doesn't mean anything
because you hear it and it's like okay
so does that mean it's 600 percent
better because six times higher well no
no it definitely does not mean that but
it means it's 600 percent better in a
very specific weighting and formula and
we can go through what that formula is
so the formula then there are three
kinds of things going on in the 28 e TI
and all the Torian designs they're
shading there's ray tracing and they're
deep learning capabilities and to
varying degrees they can potentially be
leveraged in games not games that exist
in your seam library today but perhaps
in the future so all of these have their
own compute and in order to figure out
what the heck the the difference is
between the two cards and video came up
with the following formula FP 32 times
0.8 so FP 32 is floating-point 32 times
0.8 0.8 comes from
80% because nvidia is is assuming in for
purposes of this formula that 20% of the
time is going into DN n processing
probably deep neural net or network and
the other 80% is going into FP 32 is a
pretty big assumption but that's what it
is
so FP 32 times 0.8 plus int 32 times
0.28 if you're wondering where 28% or
0.28 comes from it is because they are
taking 35% of 80% which equals twenty
eight percent so percentile math but if
you're wondering why they take 35
percent of 80 percent it's because
nvidia is assuming that in their model
workloads they've used for roughly every
100 floating-point operations they have
35-ish integer operations and then
within the shading side nvidia is
assuming a 50/50 ray tracing and non ray
tracing delivery and that's that's where
you get point two eight percent or point
two eight twenty eight percent so to
recap the beginning half of this @p
thirty-two times point eight plus and
thirty-two times point two eight plus RT
ops which will get two times 0.4 plus
tensor times point two equals 78 and the
math works but that's well the math
works and so what all this the rest of
the formula comes from ray tracing ops
is counted as ten teraflops per gig
array and they're taking forty percent
of that plus tensor which equals 113 so
let's just go through it again
FP 32 times 0.8 plus in 32 times 0.28
plus archeops times 0.4 plus tensor
times point two and at first this
formula might sound like a bullshit
marketing way to inflate the differences
between the 20 80 TI and 1080 TI to make
it sound like it's greater than it is
but so all about our TX ops stuff aside
let's get into the technical details of
the architecture and talk about how it
relates to gaming and reality and video
is pushing both architectural and
hardware side updates for touring
they're also pushing pretty heavy
software side updates and algorithmic
updates we see with the SDK for instance
all of them relate back to touring the
biggest change is at a very top level
before we drill down through each of
them include the following four primary
points and a few sub points integer and
floating-point operations can now
execute concurrently we'll talk about
more of what that means in a bit but
Pascal would suffer a pipeline stall if
you shoved an integer operation into the
pipe everything would stop all the FP
would stop can taxi concurrently it
queues up and waits for that integer
operation to complete GPS aren't great
at integer to begin with so that was a
problem and now they're going for
concurrent execution which is
potentially a big deal but depends on
how many in operations you have there's
this floating point and again talk about
that more in a moment and FP use if
you're not familiar with the way we
describe these things now and video
calls a floating-point unit a coup de
coeur but it's a floating-point unit it
does floating-point calculations so
typically these sit idle and Pascal
they're trying to reduce that idle time
with greater concurrency and then next
there's a new l1 cache and unified
memory subsystem this will accelerate
shader processing and Vidya is moving
away from the Pascal system of separate
shared memory and l1 units so for
applications which do not use shared
memory that SRAM is wasted and doing
nothing with taurine however this
unifies the SRAM structures that be your
l1 and other caches and memories on the
GPU die it unifies those SRAM structures
so that Saucer can use one structure for
all of the SRAM so that's a another
major change point three out of four
Torian has moved to to SMS per TPC now
it was previously one what does this
mean well it means that between the T
pcs you're now running with two SMS that
have 64 FP use or CUDA cores each
previously it was one that had 128 but
then you had fewer pooled resources like
cache and memory and that's another big
change so for this purpose the end
result is the same amount of FP use per
TPC or floating-point units CUDA cores
per TBC but better segmentation of
hardware which theoretically benefits
memory allocation cache utilization
workloads that don't need shared memory
for example terrain can scale it up so
it can go from up to 64 kilobyte
of l1 or it can scale down to 32
kilobytes of l1 for applications that
need the shared memory and it's either
l1 or shared memory and then you can
switch between them how much is
allocated to each so that's a big change
to you have also to load store units for
purposes of this calculation so turning
ends up with 6 megabytes of l2 for its
largest chip which is not one shipping
in g-force cards today versus three
megabytes of l2 on Pascal's largest chip
and l1 is now 64 kilobytes have shared
plus 32 K of load store or the inverse
depending on the application with two
load store units so you have a
multiplication factor of two for these
stats Pascal Yi is 24k of l1 and 2 sets
of 96k of shared memory instead just for
comparison final point before we really
get into it
G DDR 6 has a 40% reduced
end-to-end crosstalk and can clock
beyond 14 gigabits per second when
overclocking so potentially a big change
to the memory pipe in memory subsystem
and the memory bandwidth ability to deal
with memory intensive applications which
will be probably one of the biggest
contributors to Turing's performance
over pascal so getting into big touring
then well put the big touring specs on
screen now like usual the GPUs revealed
thus far aren't the full versions of
what NVIDIA has created the biggest G
for storing die is the tu 102 GPU
presented in the ti with 45 32 FPS or
cuda cores spread across 68 sm's each of
which has 64 cores so simple math there
in reality the full sized taurine GPU is
72 SMS and 4608 FP use adding 4 SMS on
top of the 28 e TI this indicates room
for a GPU with additional 256 FP use in
the future potentially a titan class
card or something although that's not a
giant jump it could perhaps go alongside
an additional 1 gigabyte of memory
Tijuana to wholly it runs with 72 SMS as
64 FPS per SM that translates again 256
more FPS than in the 2080 ti there are 8
tensor cores per SM pushing to 576 over
544 between the two devices that we have
listed on the screen and there's the
usual TMU bomb port extra map unit bump
from having an additional 4
multiprocessors with for texture map
units each memory is split across 12
32-bit wide GDD are six controllers
that's parts important or 11 on the 20
atti which is what gives us our ops
calculation or raster operation pipeline
for ROPS we end up with 8 per controller
or 88 on the TI and 96 on the biggest
but doesn't yet exist tu 102 card if
there ever is one or GPU as it is today
cache is about 6 megabytes on the TU 102
or 5,600 K on the 28 eti the additional
memory controller would allow for an
additional memory module just like
Pascal's Titan and the 1080i difference
and as a side note FP 64 or double
precision is still severely limited it
is gimped much in the same way it is on
the previous geforce cards with the same
ratio and that was in the table as well
so the days of the old and video cards
where FP 64 was much stronger or gone in
the affordable class of card you have to
go up to higher end cards for that these
days streaming multiprocessor changes
are next these are also somewhat big so
getting deeper into the architecture
taurine make several changes from the
amalgamation that was last generations
packs well design if we're honest it was
a mix of Pascal and Maxwell we made a
block diagram to help illustrate the
hierarchy of containers here we'll
explain what all of them mean in a
moment so let's let's put that on the
screen now and go through it the biggest
Torian GPU is comprised of 72s streaming
multi processors that are split between
six graphics processing clusters or G
pcs if we drill into a single GPC you'll
see that each GPC hosts six of its own
texture processing clusters up from big
Pascal's 5 T pcs the G pcs also have
dedicated raster engines and we'll talk
about that more in a moment
after this we start to see some real
changes with taurine each TPC now has to
SMS up from one SM previously this
splits other resources in half and helps
with containerization of the resources
by moving from 128 FP 32 FP use per SM
to 64 FP 32 FP use per SM Trina adds
more SMS overall extremely multi
processors which adds up more cache and
processing blocks each SM is split into
four blue
each of which then contains 16 FP 32 FP
use 16 in 32 units 2 tensor cores 1 warp
scheduler 1 dispatch unit and an L 0
instruction cache a 64 K register file
and a unified 96k L 1 data cache or
shared memory and we should have the SM
block diagram from Nvidia for that point
serena has an advertised 50% performance
per core improvement over the previous
generation so this is where we've in the
past said you can't just compare a
straight core counters core count on
GPUs because of things like this Pascal
was roughly 30% claims by Nvidia over
Maxwell 4 per core performance per core
and the definition of that is kind of
loose it could be power consumption for
a given performance or it could be Rob
perforins the next part why why why GP
C's why TBC's so we should cover that
and why they even exist above the GPC
there sits something called a command
processor you've probably seen this in
AMD block diagrams if you've ever looked
at them and video doesn't much talk
about its command processor because
AMD's is generally a bit more advanced
thanks to the console integration but
the level of that being advanced the
level to which it is useful is kind of
questionable in PC games as we've seen
in the past as well so the global
processor or the command processor
dishes out the commands to the rest of
the GPU via PCI Express that is where
they come from and it starts with the GP
sees when it's giving a command so
command processor sits at the top gives
a command down to the GP sees and then
those start doing work with their fixed
function units and spread it to the TB
sees when running a game DirectX or
OpenGL or similar commands are
dispatched via PCIe to the GPU
at which point these commands are stored
in the memory of the GPU the GPU must
then work to access those commands and
it relies on pointers to figure out
where the program is in memory so at a
much higher level this is defined in
part by the driver but that's discussion
for another time the command processor
manages multiple queues of things
talking to the GPU via DirectX and it
eats hardware available to handle each
one of those inputs canonically
a shader comes down the pipe and several
fixed-function things need to happen
shaders get spawned that might be vertex
geometry tessellation and so forth you
may need access to tes laters another
fixed function piece of hardware in
order to process some of these commands
the command processor communicates be a
PCIe to the host manages the entire GPU
chip and has some power management
functions as well the GPC is are below
the command processor
there are 6g pcs in tu 102 the GPC is
parent to 60 pcs but there is also fixed
function hardware on the GPC including
dedicated raster engines fixed
functional hardware is typically
allocated along the GPC boundaries but
the GPC is also useful for grouping T
pcs at a certain level these are all
managed together as a single unit so for
example screen space partitioning might
have six bins that are tapped for pixel
shading and service based division think
of Jie pcs as a means to allocate and
distribute the workload to the right
collection of sub resources and fixed
function hardware some of those sub
resources are T pcs which are an
indication of what resources are being
shared and bound together the torreón
TBC much like the Titan V Volta TBC
hosts to streaming multi processors the
to SMS share a unified cache and memory
pool within the TBC there are resources
that are TBC specific so when a program
comes down the pipe ones he BC might
make more sense than another when
considering the wake and sleeps dates of
its child SMS with to SMS sharing a
unified cache and memory pool we
wouldn't want to shut down the cache
unless both SMS are asleep and so these
function as one unit T pcs 8 and power
management as well as the GPC pushes
commands to the TV sees the TBC's will
wake and sleep SMS based on the optimal
load balancing for minimal power
consumption of a given workload if one
unit is half active it might make more
sense to wake the other sm in that unit
rather than wake both SMS or one sm on a
whole new TBC altogether so now how
heavy the incoming load is other shared
resources include rasterizer z' for
example at greater than one triangle per
clock you'd need a way to divide up the
triangles between multiple units for
processing this is where G pcs can
leverage
fixed-function hardware to process a
triangle and farm out the rest of the
work to its local units as for the SMS
the next part of the architecture the
biggest change again has been to
concurrency between in 32 and
floating-point operation execution so
terrain moves to concurrent execution of
FP 32 in 32 operations Pascal again
pipeline stall if it had an into
operation come down the pipe rather than
install the FPU is to allow a single
into operation to execute now they can
execute simultaneously because of
independent data paths for both int and
floating-point operations and that's one
of the bigger changes to this generation
for examples of one integer and
floating-point operations would be
encountered in games we reached out to
some game engine programmers that we
know GPUs are traditionally bad at
integer operations and so in heavy
programs typically remain on the cpu
here's a quote from one of our developer
friends quote most traditional graphics
operations are independent and purely
floating-point shading a pixel for
example doesn't require you to know
about the surrounding pixels and is
essentially just a bunch of dot products
and multiply ads but ray tracing through
an octree requires alternating integer
and FP operations for example you need
to find the nearest sub tree that array
intersects to recurse into that sub tree
intersecting with the objects is a
floating-point operation but deciding
which is the nearest is integer and
boolean logic how will this help games
if you can move more sophisticated ray
tracing to the GPU you can improve the
quality of lighting algorithms their
pixel shading can use this ray trace
data to calculate real-time shadows or
you can move physics simulation to the
GPU free in the game to simulate more
complex game systems integers aren't
just for ray tracing even though that's
mostly what that quote was talking about
just to dial it back to the very basics
here talking about integer versus
floating-point floating-point gives you
more precision you have a decimal point
after it can be FP 32 FP 64 would be
considered double precision FP 16 and we
considered half precision but you have a
decimal point there for traditional FP
32 operations and then that extends out
to give you the level of precision
integer is a hard number it's just a
whole number 11 period that's it
we're
and period that's it so you might use
integers for something like taking RT s
counting the resources if you have gold
wood stone something like that age
vampire style resources that might be
integer because there's no reason to
have that level of precision beyond a
whole number and then beyond that you
can use it for something like there are
examples online of counting units
counting objects in the game
counting 3d objects you don't need
halves and fractions for that you just
need the hard numbers so that might be
integer the question is does that stuff
go to the GPU or does it stay on the CPU
and we don't fully know that answer our
friend here who gave the developer side
quote helped out a lot with the ray
tracing side of things but typically
that stuff goes to the CPU that's why I
CPUs leverage different threads for game
logic game physics games sound all that
stuff so we're not clear 100% of what
integer operations will go to the GPU at
this point even though game engines do
use a decent amount of into operations
it's just a lot of them go to the CPU so
that might change it might not we're not
really clear on it but that seems to be
the theme for a lot of the stuff with
new technology as you know you know
there's potential II just don't know
where it's being used so next up memory
and the cache subsystem have received
some of the more substantial updates and
taurine memory is not unified so there's
a single path for texture caching and
memory loads and that frees up l1 memory
to be it's closer to the core so it's
the most important applications can
decide whether they need more shared
memory more l1 cache and then it can
switch between how much of each there is
between the SMS they can also divide
into groups of either 64 K of l1 32 k of
shared or the opposite split across to
load and store units and this helps with
applications where one structure may
have previously gone unused now it can
just pull that either that shared memory
or that cache and push it over into the
other one so you might typically have
shared memory going unused in one
application it just wants a lot of cache
now you can pull that shared memory
allocation turn it into cash really some
of it anyway so that leaves the expense
of SRAM more utilized than
the expensive primarily in that there's
very limited amounts of it and then
after that we saw tents recorders and RT
cords to talk about so this is a big
part of this architecture and the one
that is the most uncertain in the future
of what will be useful for games so it's
one that will primarily be leveraged in
very targeted applications that have
explicit use of these new types of cores
and for gaming chips it's more about
inferencing than training because
everything's done in real time so it's
more about figuring out what's happening
not training for future simulations or
scenarios which would be training versus
inferencing and DL SS their deep learned
super sampling deep lore and
anti-aliasing those are situations we'll
talk about more later that will utilize
the the deep learning side of the chip
as for RT cores these are specifically
used for accelerating bounding volume
hierarchy navigation when testing for
points of intersection between rays that
are traced and triangles that may
collide with those trace trays be VHS
are used in many 3d applications like in
our own intro animation with blender and
are useful for storing complex 3d data
ultimately 3d objects look something
more like a whole bunch of numbers just
a mess of numbers and coordinates and
that's what the GPU and CPU are dealing
with when a GPU is trying to determine
if a ray intersects with a triangle it
must scan the entire list of numbers to
determine if there's a hit doing so
creates pipeline stalls and makes
real-time ray tracing difficult but not
fully impossible as it has been done as
recently as 2014
tomorrow children game still in order to
speed up intersection checks all of this
data can be shoved into a bounding
volume this isn't new technology by the
way and then the application and GPU can
determine whether the Ray intersects
with different groupings of geometry
using the new tensor and RT cores so I'm
now going to try and explain what Nvidia
CEO more-or-less failed to explain on
stage when he did the whole boxes within
boxes thing so if we have intersection
checking going on with a 3d object like
this 1080 TI video card you're trying to
figure out from the point of view of the
camera where is the ray of light going
to hit which triangle will it intersect
with
so that we can then figure out the
correct color for or the correct
rendering of that triangle so we're
tracing away from the camera
you can either trace it against every
triangle here all of that data just a
ton of numbers and scan it all you're
wasting thousands of cycles for that or
you trace it against maybe let's say
three cross sections so we cut this card
into three pieces top half middle or top
top third middle and bottom third when
the Ray then hits what we're checking is
against three pieces rather than
everything and so maybe we figure out
okay it's not in the top one it's not in
the bottom one so we know it's in the
center of the object so the Ray comes
back it checks hits something in the
center and now it just drills deeper
into smaller and smaller bounding
volumes until it eventually gets to the
triangle that it intersects and what
that does is in this analogy it allows
us to completely ignore the bottom third
the top third of the triangles and focus
only on the center and that is where the
advantage is derived and then you end up
using our tea cores and tensor cores for
different elements of deep learning or
raytrace in this case the arti cores so
you're just doing a lot of matrix
processing so the shader uses a ray
probe to find the section of triangles
and then it decodes that section there's
an intersection check to see which
subsection the triangle might be in and
then it continues on until it eventually
finds a triangle scanning like this
again thousands of cycles typically so
not all that feasible for a GPU to
complete real-time ray tracing
but our T cores are supposed to help the
RT cores accelerate this by
parallelizing the workload some RT cores
will work on BBH scan while others are
running intersection checks with
triangles fetching and triangle scanning
the sm meanwhile can continued normal
processing of floating point in integer
operations now concurrently and is no
longer bogged down with a BBH scan for
rays this allows normal shading
processing to continue while the SM
waits for the Ray of course all of this
hinges upon game developers deciding to
adopt and use the RT X SDK for their
games and it could take years before we
start seeing any meaningful
implementations
beyond the first handful of titles the
technology has a sound foundation but
minimal practical applications at this
time limiting its usefulness let's get
into some examples of what the RT X SDK
can be used for before closing out the
video a few interesting notes on RT X
first like AMD did with trueaudio RT X
can be used for sound tracing it never
really went anywhere with Andes true
audio but maybe there's a chance here it
can also be used for physics and
leveraged for collisions by tracing rays
into objects or for AI and NPC visual
sight data again at present we're not
aware of any such implementations in
existing games but it is possible in
gaming applications RT X will be mixed
with standard rasterization this is not
full scene ray tracing as you might have
been led to believe by some of the demos
but it is highly selective instead
thresholds are used to determine what
should or shouldn't be ray traced in a
scene and at present and Vidya is only
using 1 to 2 samples per pixel plus
denoising to make ray tracing feasible
in real time there's a long way yet to
go for the dream to be fully realized of
real time ray tracing an entire scene RT
X is useful for 100% ray traced scenes
sure but mostly those in which there are
pre-rendered animations ie not real time
separately from this ray tracing can be
used to call objects with greater
accuracy than bounding box volumes are
today we aren't sure if there are any
applications of this in games presently
and we are also unsure of if this would
even work when considering how many
cards don't reasonably support
accelerated ray tracing so while the
concept works with RT X the extent of
which it is applicable to Pascal Maxwell
where ante cards is uncertain a game
developer might have to build the game
with its traditional solutions in place
and then also ray-traced : which could
complicate things especially in
competitive landscapes real time ray
tracing may prove most useful as a
workflow speed-up for developers like
when modifying lights in real time and
not baking pre computed ambient
occlusion or shadow maps shadow
reflections are also interesting use
cases for ray tracing Nvidia isn't
denoising the entire image and applies
one denoising filter per light this
means that increasing light sources
could
or even will decrease performance and
the population of tech demos with a
single light seems to solidify this
denoising require specific data on hit
distance scene depth object normal and
light size and direction there are three
types of denoise used in RTX directional
light D noise radio light D noises and
rectangular D noises all of which use
different algorithms to determine ground
truth for the image think that'll cover
us for now for the architecture
discussion there's more but that seems
pretty good
so mostly focusing here on big terrain
on the SM Arc changes ygp sees TBC's and
so forth exist hopefully that helped you
out and then we do have things like the
cards taken apart we'll see what we do
with those and video sent a last minute
email saying no disassembly of cards so
we'll figure it out there's a lot of
screws there though so clearly it's
already been done I mean is this this
assembly of a card it's a backplate I
don't know does that count it's not this
it's not active disassembly so I don't
know we'll figure all that out later but
we have the videos we'll post them
whenever we feel like we can or want to
and otherwise subscribe for more there
will be a lot of touring content coming
up holy this architecture I've helped
you figure out what's going on but again
this is not a review please do not
assume that all this stuff will work out
perfectly because we haven't tested it
so don't pre-order buy just yet wait for
a review and subscribe for more
