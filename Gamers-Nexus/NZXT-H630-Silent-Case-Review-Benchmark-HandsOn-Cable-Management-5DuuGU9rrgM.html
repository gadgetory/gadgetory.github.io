Nexus Donette and today we're looking at
NZXT is new h 630 silent series
enclosure which is priced at around $150
MSRP and is still brand new the Aged 630
use is the same chassis that's the
underlying frame as the phantom 630 but
has new paneling that aims to decrease
noise emissions and mitigate operating
volume without cutting too deeply into
performance in theory as always let's
cover hard specs and then jump into my
opinions and the the issues i've
encountered and finally we'll talk a bit
about benchmark performance against
other similarly priced cases so respects
first the H 630 is a damn big case it
measures in at around nine point six
inches wide by 21.5 tall by twenty two
point three deep and it's really heavy I
don't have the exact number in front of
me but it's easily thirty pounds so very
heavy case each of the individual panels
excuse me it's also very heavy because
not only is there a porous foam material
in there too in theory
absorb sound but the steel is also extra
thick because they're trying to block
any sound from escaping through through
the actual metal other than that the
case is outfitted with a single 200
millimeter intake fan and a single 140
millimeter exhaust fan and there isn't a
fan controller on the H 630 contrary to
the previous two NZXT towers I reviewed
the 820 and the phantom 820 and phantom
630 but there is a fan hub on the rear
side of the board similar to the switch
810 so so that is there if you do have a
ton of fans and would rather manage
through that pathway then use the
motherboard connections the system has
room for up to two 240 millimeter 280
milliliter or massive three sixty
millimeter radiators in the front and or
top positions and 360 you'll mostly find
for open loops if you're not familiar
with that one alternatively it can be
outfitted with an additional front 200
millimeter fan and up to two top 200 mm
fans and to bottom 140 millimeter fans
with variations of 140 and 120 in
between all of those the drive cages are
completely modular and can be removed of
unused theoretically freeing up your
intake channels and if you do want to
remove all those drive cages there are
also two rear side SSD sleds
so that's identical again to what's
found on the Phantom 630 cable
management space is abundant with 27
millimeters or actually in my opinion
though I think it is 27 millimeters it's
somewhere around there it's between 27
and 36 millimeters of room on the rear
side of the case for cable routing so
that's very easy to fit a 24-pin power
connectors with stacked PCIe connectors
for instance very easy to do the H 630
like the P 630 has got the same cutouts
riddling the entire chassis making for
plenty of pathways to more easily
conceal your cables and it's got rubber
grommets on almost all of them you can
basically there are cutouts available
for ATX boards for micro ATX boards and
and then you can basically route all of
your I ok Buhl's
and power cables through whatever
channel you want to so all that's very
cool for a cable management enthusiasts
other than that stuff what makes the 630
unique right because the phantom 630 has
all of these things for the most part so
what makes the h 630 unique well first
of all it's got a foam lined top and in
front and side panels which I spoke
about briefly and that's just that's
really just the start of it you won't
find any large meshes or extra fan ports
in the side panels in this case and no
large meshes in the top or front panels
either for that matter just a very
narrow intake slit for each of those and
exhausts obviously for the top you can't
really intake any air through there the
Aged 630 uses very thick steel as I've
mentioned and that's lined with porous
sound damping film which theoretically
mitigates sound emissions from your
internals and other than that all the
cracks
the the panelling where the panels are
either bent or you know angled is all
cocked so no sound can escape from that
either let's talk about this foam I
talked about pretty extensively about
sound damping and soundproofing
techniques in the full review that's
linked below but I'll go over it briefly
here as well and performance computing
there are a few different philosophies
to soundproofing cases you have
redirection and reflection sound
blocking and sound absorbing that sort
of the main approaches and these are all
mixed together in improper case designs
as well so nd XT uses sound absorption
methods Silverstone tends to favor sound
redirection and fractal design tends to
favor sound blocking obviously again
like I said all these are mixed together
but those are what they favor let's talk
about each of those briefly we first
talked about sound redirection methods
and Silverstone's rv0 for that was
demoed to us at CES shown here where
they've angled the enclosure paneling
and intake grills to be pointed backward
and away from the user
this helps direct sound away from the
user without removing the grills and
intakes entirely so there's still intake
or exhaust or whatever you need and the
fans can still breathe but the noise
that's coming out of those fans is being
bounced the the sound waves are
physically being bounced backwards away
from the user you can still hear it it's
just not as bad it's not directly
towards your ears and that is quite
noticeable on the other front we have
fractal who as I said they tend to block
noise rather than absorb its echo they
still use reflection techniques to
whittle down the sound energy so for
instance the defined excel case has a
top mounted fan that's angled slightly
toward the rear of the case if you've
noticed and this helps reflect return
the the returning sound waves toward the
rear and away again from the user and
then we have NZXT who's focusing on
sound absorption by using film and
Silverstone and fractal also use foam
and zxe is just really emphasizing it
much more and there are two primary
types of sound damping film there is
porous and resin
I won't go too into detail on resin in
here I do that in the article but porous
sound damping foam is what NZXT uses and
it has a microscopic ish cell structure
of pores so when a sound wave hits the
foam on the panel part of the sound
energy from that wave is converted into
heat which is generated by the friction
between the wave and the cell structure
and then that part that's converted into
heat is taking energy away from the
actual sound wave so it's decreasing the
noise emission and the remaining portion
of the sound energy is reflected this is
pretty basic stuff it's not specific to
computers it's reflected and then the
process repeats as the wave is
diminished bouncing between surfaces
until it eventually leaves the case and
the goal here is to force the sound wave
to travel as far as possible prior to
exiting the case and along the way it's
diminishing its energy in two primary
methods one is simply by the actual
bouncing process and two is from the
friction that's generating heat energy
out of sound energy so again I describe
all this if it's interesting to you in
the article but I do keep a pretty
top-level speaking specifically to NZXT
soundproofing I was underwhelmed it's
not particularly quiet it's nothing like
I mean the define art for is kind of a
cheaper case so you can't hold it to the
same degree as the Aged 630 or define
exile but it's nothing like the define
Excel in terms of actual innovation and
it's not really like Nanaki a product
either not that they're available in the
US but still good comparison other than
the soundproof he's not being really
that exciting the performance is not
exciting at all either on the aged 630
there's no doubt that the aged 630 is
quieter than the phantom 630 on high
settings but by sticking high rpm
performance fans on the aged 630 without
including some sort of fan controller we
end up with a system that's ultimately
louder than a voltage regulated fan
array where you can decrease voltages to
lower the RPMs and thus lower the noise
emission with cooling with quiet
cases you make a sacrifice right you
have to sacrifice something somewhere
and in the case of quiet cooling that's
going to be performance you don't have
to sacrifice all of your performance to
get some level of silence and you don't
have to sacrifice all your silence to
get some level of performance normally
the way this is done is by using fan
controllers in conjunction with all
these wave deflection and absorption
techniques so that you can keep fans at
lower speeds when it's not important to
have performance and you put them at
higher speeds when it's important to
have performance like when you're gaming
and you have a headset on so you don't
care as much about the noise so just
some stuff to think about there as far
as NZXT again not very impressive but
let's move on to cooling performance
first of all I had very strange results
from testing the age 630 with additional
fans in the additional fan ports I try
to test cases with some of the option
fans populated optional fans populated
so I can tell you guys what the optimal
configuration is but I saw almost no
note where the improvement with age 630
and that's talked about in great depth
in the review below because it was very
strange so click on that for that
information however I can show you the
case for his case benchmarks so here
we're looking at the CPU bench for the
Aged 630 against all of our other cases
we recently of course reviewed the
silverstone our bo2 that's up at the top
phantom 6:30 and 8:20 are both in there
as well and these 638 630 rather is
slightly below the pea 630 which makes
sense in the H 630 our overclocked 35 70
K performed at sixteen point seven C
when idle and 57 C under load and that's
decidedly unimpressive but not really
scary either especially compared against
the our vo2 which I just benched it's
it's not all that all that impressive
there's really no other way to say even
similarly unimpressive is the GP
performance where the aged 630 Falls to
the very bottom of the chart at fifty
three point one C even
the 7c Idol is quite good actually the
the load temperature is just not all
that great it's not like it's gonna kill
your GPU or anything it's not that
extreme it's just not what you buy you
know you don't drop $150 and expect that
it's it's tough to recommend this case
as a whole there's always a trade-off
between noise and performance but the H
630 fails to succeed in either aspect of
its design it's not bad it's just not
it's not you know making anyway it's not
it's just not blowing a hole in the
industry and that makes it tough to
recommend it's absolutely not a bad case
don't let me give you that impression
it's not the silent enclosure we were
hoping for its performance leaves a ton
to be desired but other than that it has
good build quality it has good ease of
installation features that has good
paneling has it's not prohibitively loud
or warm it's just not awesome in terms
of silence or being cool and that said
it's tough to make alternative
recommendations as well because this
price point is sort of unique NZXT is on
to something and there just aren't a lot
of good quiet cases at the 150-dollar
and up price point other you start
hitting some of the Leon Lee stuff but
that's a completely different ballgame
on the low end you've got the define r4
that's around a hundred bucks that's
geared more toward mid-range systems and
won't be as effective for high-end
machines the same is true for BitFenix
is ghost if you're building a mid-range
system look into those then you've got
an anoxia stuff if it ever comes to the
US and that's sort of the 130 dollar
range though no way of telling what MSRP
will really be and as far as 150 and up
I don't know a whole lot of cases off
the top of my head I'm sure some of you
do please post those in the comments
below for others all around it's just an
awkward situation for a case the price
point is good the features are good the
enthusiasts class focus is good NZXT
just has to figure out how to deliver
more on either the silence or the
performance fronts and
and that's where I'm gonna leave this so
if you're interested in the case don't
let me stop you from buying it it's
nothing catastrophic lis broken just not
what we were hoping for and I will see
you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
