for multi-gpu it would seem that a beef
has spawned on Twitter one between
myself Paul and now even J so if you've
been following along we are going to be
responding to Paul's attempted overclock
where and he tied our score and J's
actual number one overclock for two GPUs
in times by extreme right now so Paul
the wannabe economy clock droppin under
Fulton prankster will soon be beaten in
times by extreme and J will follow and J
I got 99 problems but a chip eight one
before that this video is brought to you
by be quiet and the silent based 601 the
silent based 601 is one of the quietest
cases we've tested recently laying claim
to the crown of silence on our charts
and still manages reasonable air flow by
shipping with a pair of high quality
fans the 601 also uses well-designed
panels and unique ease of installation
features the streamlined builds includes
a well placed dust filtration and is
large enough as a box to fit a full ATX
bill learn more at the link in the
description below alright so for this
video the hell what we are actually
doing is benchmarking envy link and the
goal is to see how did 228 est eyes do
versus 210 ATT is versus a single 20
atti it's been a while since we've
looked at multi-gpu scaling it's never
been that good typically actually 100%
of the time the conclusion from us has
been don't bother
but it's interesting NV link this is a
100 gigabyte per second bridge for the
ti or 50 gigabytes per second for the
2080 so that gives us a lot of options
and in this testing we will also be
revisiting the pcie 3.0 bandwidth
limitation question to see if we're
finally exceeding that bus so first of
all for the street for the stream
discuss you probably saw the slider the
lower thirds thing earlier but we are
going to be doing a rip J or a rip Paul
or some kind of combined stream
following up our trip LTTE and we'll be
doing that on Wednesday
the week coming up Wednesday starting at
roughly 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time in the US
and that will be live on our YouTube
channel so the goal for that is going to
be testing our hybrid card that we built
hopefully it's actually good I don't
know but with probably go with envy link
and see how it does with two cards
you'll see where we place on time spy
extreme scores stuff like that be a lot
of fun make sure you tune in for that
for today though what we were testing
has already been laid out we are using
OneNote an EVGA card for the card in the
first slot and the efi card heavily
modified here in the second slot so
that's important to note the scores will
be slightly higher by nature of higher
clocks than a single card but we're
talking single digit percentages here
like three on average versus a just
straight efi card and then we're doing
that in NV link so other than that I
guess let's get into it
ashes of the singularity is an
incredibly interesting benchmarking tool
for this scenario ashes it uses explicit
multi-gpu via the PCIe bus to allow
multiple GPUs a very and make a unique
feature of dx12 to work with one another
this also means that it communicates
entirely along the PCIe bus the cards
can't lean on the 100 gigabyte per
second bandwidth provided to them by NV
link or the bandwidth provided by
typical SLI setup instead all that data
transacts over the significantly more
limited bandwidth of PCIe which is
limited to 16 gigabytes per second and
x16 mode and is already doing work in
our Titan v testing and we'll pop that
old chart up on the screen we found that
the PCIe bandwidth limits were finally
being strained again this is with no
supporting bridge and it's the only
title we know of that really makes use
of multi GPU in this scenario for the 28
ET is removed the NV link bridge and
just tested them via explicit multi-gpu
through the PCIe bus this is the
determine at what point we hit the pcie
3.0 limitations with no assistance from
outside bridges with PCIe 4.0 looming
there's been a lot of talk of end of
life for 3.0 or at least the end of its
usable life in high end and through
systems and ashes we found our maximum
forints as 120 7.2 FPS average average
across ten runs running in by 16 and by
8 mode which would be common in Z 370
platforms we had a measurable and
consistent loss that exited margin of
error the loss was about 1.7 percent not
a big deal running in by 8x8 we saw a
massive performance penalty unexpected
actually the cards were now limited to
107 FPS average resulting in a 16% loss
and we measured this a couple of times
just for parody times by extreme is an
extremely useful synthetic tool for this
type of benchmark as well and also runs
memory pretty hard for the GPUs we ran
times by extreme five times each on
these cards automated and found a
difference of 0.1 9% between by 8 by 8
and by 16 by 16 for graphics test 1
which is geometrically intensive this is
way within margin of test variance for
3d mark and produces zero loss of
performance between the dual by 8 and
the dual by 16 modes part of this is
likely because of envy links additional
bandwidth reducing reliance on the PCIe
bus for fire strike ultra we observed an
FPS difference of about 1% it was a 0.9
percent difference in graphics 1 and a 1
point I will percent difference in
graphics 2 we ended up running these in
additional 5 times for a total of 10
each and found the results repeated fire
strike has variance run to run so we
cannot with full confidence state that a
difference exists but if one does exist
here it amounts to about a 1% advantage
in the duel by 16 mode versus duel by 8
so other than ashes where we run into a
PCIe bus limitation we know that the
envy link bridge and even SLI is enough
for a by 16 and by 8 configuration to
work well without any meaningful
bottlenecking and that's why we're
moving back to the 8080 6k bench to look
at comparative numbers versus our
previous benchmark results so that we
can compare the envy link version of the
2080 TI's whereas the single version of
the 28 guys versus some other cards
first up is Sniper Elite for Sniper
Elite 4 produced some of the best
scaling results as it often does this
game is also the best DirectX 12
implementation
we're aware of so it's scaling will not
apply to all games universally it is an
outlier but a good one that can teach us
a lot with our usual benchmark settings
the dual envied links cards push past
200 FPS with 4k high and hit an average
of 200 10 FPS under non overclocked
settings this outperforms the stock RTX
20 80 TI fe by about 94% this is nearly
perfect 2x scaling and has been rare to
achieve in the past years but it's
always exciting when we see it because
this is what multi-gpu should be like
and almost never is versus the
overclocked single 2080 ti we saw a
performance gain of 71% with the stock
2080 TI is in NV link not bad and
overclocking the two cards although
annoying to find stability would regain
that lead the GTX 1080 Ti is an SLI dat
about 170 FPS the next major
consideration is frame time consistency
multi-gpu has traditionally shown at
terrible frames a frame interval
consistency often resulting in things
like micro stutter or intolerable
tearing for this pairing as you can see
in our frame time plot the lowest scale
pretty well it's not a near-perfect 2x
scaling like the average was but it's
pretty close as a reminder these plots
are to be read as the lowest is best but
more consistent is it more important
than just being a low interval 16
milliseconds would be about the 60 FPS
line just for perspective it's very
impressive performance in this game
which is more a testament to Sniper
Elite Force development team than
anything else they've continued to build
some of the best optimized games in the
space we also tested with Sniper Elite
for our ultra settings just in case
there was a sea view bottleneck here's a
quick chart with those results but
they're not too different in terms of
scaling Far Cry 5 and the dunia engine
are up next these are also show some SLI
or NV link scaling support and at 4k
high Far Cry 5 plots the r-tx 20 atti
single card at 74 FPS average for stock
or 83 overclocked loads that stick
around 55 to 60 fps and each value with
dual cards we managed 108 FPS average
posting a growth of 46% over the single
20 ATT is
card 74 FPS average that's not nearly as
exciting as the past result but at least
it's still some scaling at 50% scaling
though you can't help but feel like
you're only getting six hundred dollars
of value out of your additional $1,200
purchase for the lows that we're looking
at a 0.1% of 60 FPS compared to a 0.1%
of 55 FPS on the stock 20 atti so no
improvement there let's look at a more
valuable frame time plot as these 0.1%
metrics don't tell the whole story in
our frame time chart we can see the
limitations of scaling
although the envy links cards run a
higher average they failed to sustain
similar scaling and frame time
consistency frame times are spike here
and potentially more jarring although
raw frame rate alone makes up for much
of this lost frame to frame interval
consistency back to the main chart we
also have the 1080i cards in SLI to
consider in this configuration the SLI
1080 T is operate at 91 point 4 FPS
average with spurious lows bouncing
around between 42 and 66 for the 0.1%
metric although average is high for
averages the overall performance uplift
amounts to about 60% over a single 1080p
is c2 and outperforms a single 2080 TI
fe card of course there will be games
where SLI gets you nothing but instances
like this will permit outperforming new
hardware at the same price with old
Hardware shadow of the Tomb Raider is
next this is a new game and will
eventually host r-tx features in theory
but didn't at the time of filming the
game also uses a modified crystal engine
it's got a lot of issues with envy link
and SLI and Nvidia is aware of them as
of now we have experienced blue screens
of death upon launch upon minimizing it
upon enabling TAA we've experienced
crashes upon minimizing and seemingly
other random crashes fortunately we were
able to eventually figure out how to
work around these issues for just long
enough to run a benchmark just know that
the game is extremely unstable with
multi-gpu
one of the other issues we discovered
was constant blue screens with again taa
enabled which is unfortunately what
we've been using for our full GPU
reviews so for this reason we retested
the 1080 Ti with taa off as well just
for a baseline we did not retest all
devices
only those which are marked at 4k shadow
of the Tomb Raider shows a few FPS
difference between the 1080i sc2 with TA
a on and off this shows that there's
minimal overall performance impact but
it will offset our data a bit the 2080
TI fe single card averaged 67 FPS
originally with a load tightly tied
around 56 to 58
this means frame times are very
consistent with a single card multi-gpu
got us 147 F he has average and the dual
1080 T is got 113 FPS average these two
numbers are directly related as they
were run under fully identical
conditions for SLI it becomes even more
difficult to justify the 20 ATT is
versus the 1080 T is not that we fully
endorse SLI is a good overall option
anyway F 1 2018 also showed scaling and
its results envied links 20 ATT is
managed 168 FPS average here with 1% Lew
is at around 69 FPS the RDX 2080 ti
single card had an average of 99 with
its 1% lows at 47 when stock the results
is scaling of about 70% pretty damn good
it's not as impressive as sniper but
still a better gain overall than
expected for SLI configurations over the
past few years as for the 1080p eyes in
SLI we measured them at 88 FPS average
and 57 for the lows a single 1080 T is C
2 ran at 81 fps giving us a dismal
scaling of 9% hell-blade is up next just
for a dx11 Unreal Engine title this game
has some of the best graphics in the
game right now making it a good
benchmarking option and represents
Unreal Engine 4 well it also did not
show any scaling in fact technically we
observed at negative scaling with this
title which is not all too uncommon with
SLI we saw a drop of about 16% in
performance with additional jarring and
tearing during gameplay doing research
for this content we learned that there
is a custom hell-blade sli profile out
there made by a modder
but it's not an Nvidia official profile
out of the box that appears that NV link
does not work with hell-blade but it
also looks like some modding could be
used to hack it to work GTA 5 is last
this is another dx11 title but it uses
the rage engine and
has been more heavily tuned for graphics
hardware over its three-year tenure
it also shows some scaling and averages
though not necessarily in low-end frame
time performance we posted a 132 FPS
average the env links cards as opposed
to a 77 FPS average with a single efi
GPU the difference is an approximate 71
percent improvement in average frame
rate but lockstep frame time performance
there is no improvement in low-end
performance overall and for dual gtx
980ti cards in sli we managed 117 FPS
average for a gain of 83% over a single
1080i SC to allowing it to outperform a
2080 ti when overclocked albeit with
similar frame time consistency
illustrated in the lows we are nearing
CPU limitations in this game with hard
limits around 170 FPS average for our
configuration there is a results
friendly link this was the most
popularly requested content in our
recent livestream where we overclocked a
single card that actually ultra it was
super chats non-stop asking when will
you test NV link well there it is so I
don't know I to give you my genuine
opinion on this with SLI at our outlet
we have routinely found that it's never
been worth it in the past because the
risk of things like blue screens as we
saw in shadow of the Tomb Raider sure it
will be fixed but do you want a game to
come out and not be able to play it for
a month or play it with one card and
wonder if it will ever be resolved if
you have that kind of patience cool but
you might be dealing with that a lot so
that's always been one of our concerns
with SLI and then other games just with
poor scaling like anything below really
60 70 percent doesn't feel too good when
you're spending two times the amount of
money on cards and you're getting really
something more like 50% more performance
not 100% more performance so that never
feels great but then again if you're
trying to hit we had sown in the stream
the other night asking what do I need to
hit 240 Hertz frequently or regularly or
all the time I mean this would pretty
much do it and to be completely fair to
Nvidia since the last time we looked at
SLI it looks like support overall for
the modern games has expanded
significantly so there are actually a
lot of games out now
that do support SLI and this is SLI even
though it's called envy link as it
behaves
it is SLI just with a different bridge
that has more bandwidth so it's getting
it more difficult to come to a
conclusion on whether or not you should
actually consider multi-gpu we only
tested a few games here it is not
indicative of everything if you doom for
example for the longest time probably to
some degree even now really didn't scale
at all
it wasn't supported I haven't checked in
the last couple months if it's changed
cool but a lot of the time these games
they just don't get support there
there's negative scaling on a lot of
games it takes a long time to get
support in a lot of games so that's
always been the concern with multi-gpu
it does look better today than in the
past will say that much but is it worth
it I we would still generally make the
recommendation to go a single GPU
because you're less likely to run into
those issues that are extremely
frustrating when you have not just a
$700 card but now a $1200 card that will
be doing nothing except for blocking air
flow because they're all three slots now
if SLI or env link isn't supported in a
particular game so that's the concern
now it does perform better overall the
games we test to do show it in a better
light generally although a couple of
them were 30 40 % scallion we saw hell
or hell blade was negative scaling one
of the games had a 9% uplift for the
1080 T is an SLI f1 I think that was so
it's a mixed bag whether or not you want
to do it I mean we gave you some data
but really you need a lot more than we
have here you need like every game to
get a full picture of it and that's not
even the problem the problem is what do
the new games do how long do they take
to get support so our general
recommendations still single card but if
you do do already have like a 1080i and
you grab a second one for cheap enough
maybe used or something it might be
worth considering as opposed to for
example twenty atti
because you can spend half the money and
get pretty similar performance or even
more just only some of the time that's
the big question with multi-gpu anyway
