MSI x2 99 motherboards over on the other
side of this booth and those included
some changes to the MSI MDOT - heat
shields that we previously looked at
they've been revamped quite a bit
actually we talked about those in that
video I'll recap in a bit here but they
have another response to the MDOT -
thermals and that is this added cars
before getting to that this video is
brought to you by Corsair and their new
vengeance or RGB LED memory which has
hand-selected ICS for overclocking and
you find more in the link in the
description below on that so we've got
an AIC and as you can see here it
actually targets to m dot EU SSDs and
they support the full form factor 2280
form factor SSDs then the interesting
part is aside from the storage aspect to
talk about in a moment there's a small
fan here to provide some cooling so this
is the biggest problem with the MSP is
now a few notes on this if you're not up
to speed on how MDOT to as a seasoned
thermals work generally speaking
overheating is not a problem however if
you're doing really constantly
steady-state workloads especially big
sequential transfers particularly in a
raid it can become a problem
it is pretty uncommon though that said
some of the motherboards don't really
help with the temperatures in a way that
makes any sense so this would assist by
moving the SSDs onto an A ICU socket it
into a PCIe by 8 slot so it's an X 8 on
the PCIe and then that gives you full
bandwidth and throughput to the devices
while providing some cooling through
here there's a little on/off switch over
here as well which I believe might be
for the family this is a pre-production
model in addition to the 2 m2 SSD s on
the back side of the card there's a 2.5
inch SSD or hard drive slot you'd
probably put a hard drive in there
realistically now why you would put one
there I'm not a hundred cent clear on
yet it might be worth trying out but
either way there's a slot back there
there's the band with the support if
it's just a hard drive anyway so they've
got one there for cooling the fan spins
close
through goes across the normal heat
sinks that they call the EM to shield
assuming these have the same change as
the motherboards which I'm not clear if
they do if they have the same change as
the motherboard there would be a three
millimeter thick thermal pad there with
a higher watt per meter Kelvin or
thermal conductivity rating than on the
previous pads that we looked at for the
original MSIM two heat shield so that's
some changes that are relevant so blow
the cross there goes out the back of the
case and covers your thermals the reason
that something like this would make
sense if you do happen to use those
steady-state workloads with a higher
throughput that causes thermal issues of
throttling or whatever would be because
with the normal heat shields or heat
sinks or whatever you call it on the
motherboard normally heat gets trapped
underneath particularly with
double-sided MDOT - SSDs and there are
quite a few of those like the Patriot
Hellfire for example so when the heat is
sinks through the top really doesn't do
a lot of good if you have no direct
airflow over the heatsink and no air
flow under the SSD where all the heat is
just racking up and getting stuck there
so that would solve that now to go back
to the motherboards talk about that
briefly at the beginning of this and
more detail in the motherboard video but
just to cover that for the sake of the
name of this video the motherboards have
a few new types of heat sinks one of
them is called frozers they're naming it
frozen line second generation these were
the first generation the one under here
the frozer heat sinks are made of
aluminum they're a little bit thicker
they don't have fins or anything to
speak of but they've got a better
thermal pad on there in theory now
technically I will say display having a
three millimeter thick their home pad
you generally want a smaller one because
it's less area to transfer through you
really don't want to have a big thermal
interface like thermal paste or throwing
pads between your metal but the reason
you would have a thicker one is to make
sure you can accommodate all the
different types of recipes because
they're really not standardized any
reasonable expectation so they've got
the changes to the motherboards I've got
two changes to this the motherboard
version still no direct airflow but it's
just a better he think overall so we'll
be looking at that in more detail after
contact for now though
check the channel for other coverage
we're gonna be looking at some of the
video cards from MSI including the
Lightning already looks at the X 299
motherboard and

and Razak stuff that directly thank you
for watching I'll see you all next time
