nexus donna at CES 2015 we're still at
msi sweet they have a lot of rooms and a
lot of stuff right now we're looking at
this insane laptop it's actually got a
mechanical keyboard on it but before I
get to that this coverage is brought to
you by cyber power and their vapor
gaming console so this is a gtat msi
laptop and it's equipped with 29 ATM
GPUs and sli we're just crazy enough as
it is and then it's got a mechanical
keyboard which is probably the most
interesting thing for a lot of us now
the obvious issue here is size so it's
already it's kind of fat it's meant to
be a desktop replacement you can't fit
mechanical switches on a normal laptop
that's just a trade-off you're going to
make but it is using cherry MX brown
switches from cherry of course and it is
in partnership with steel series for the
keyboard as with most msi laptops other
than that this pops off pretty easily
which will show you in the b-roll and
it's got four m dot to SSDs in there
that are currently 128 gigabytes but can
be upgraded to 256 this one's running
kingston you can potentially throw other
things in there so then there are four
dimm slots for the memory and it goes up
to 32 gigabytes at 1600 megahertz
anything beyond that is on you and
finally the screen size it's an 18 inch
screen it is 1080 so nothing too crazy
fancy but it is a 1080 screen and
because of the issue of fitting a laptop
in a backpack it actually comes with a
backpack that will fit this laptop and
then there's also a pack of five key
caps if you wanted to switch out that
woz de and escape here or one key or
something like that and in addition to
the keyboard there's also a large
touchpad which is sort of
disproportionate from what we're used to
if you hit the number button in the top
here it's got a half take response so I
you feel a small vibration and then it
enables a numpad that you can disable by
tapping it again so if you want a 10-key
it's there for you so that is the GTA d
it ranges 3300 to thirty seven hundred
dollars and and will be available
shortly so check the links of the
description below for more information
on this laptop and on the other laptops
will be posting two more in a couple
days so be sure to check the channel for
that it's got some really cool nvidia
stuff we can
say quite yet what it is but check back
and I'll see you next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
