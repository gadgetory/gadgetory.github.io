blog for the Vega frontier edition
hybrid mod disclaimer I'm not sure this
is going to work so we're going to try
there may not be a results edition of
this video it might just be built blog
and then abject failure so we'll find
out this is the Vega frontier edition
card we already have a teardown if
you're curious you can see that on the
channel put a card in the video so you
can find that or the review is also
online so the challenge here is going to
be figuring out how we get a liquid
cooler mounted to these odd mounting
hole positions so they are 64
millimeters apart whereas something like
the rx series cards were closer to 53 54
52 point 5 something like that and the
Nvidia cards don't fit either so this is
a new unique hole spacing which means
that we're going to have to have a new
unique method to get a CLT on there
before getting post content this is
brought to you by EVGA and their hybrid
mod for the GTX 10 series cards we were
going to try and use one but it is made
for GTX 10 series of cards if you have a
1080 TI 1080 1070 or other card like
that you can find a link of the
description below for the hybrid mod
it's an easy mod to do and improves
thermal significantly alright so
speaking of that this is what I wanted
to use originally because we've used it
for basically all of these mods since
the beginning of time except for the rx
for a dihybrid mod that a lot of people
seem to have forgotten we did because it
was the most I don't know it was it was
really the least organized of all of
them in terms of the final product
because we had to get a bunch of parts
on a bunch of different things so the
reason this won't work and any of the
other aces that cooler is made for a GPU
or a CPU even is because the hole
spacing doesn't line up so as you can
see we can line up one of them and
that's it the hole spacing here is these
verses these quite a bit wider so we
can't use this kit and we also can't use
the eighth attack CPU coolers because if
we look at with my bracket if we look at
this this is for an Intel CPU
the holes just don't match I mean you
can't even see any of them so we've got
one here one here one here on here so
that doesn't line up Intel is 80 by 80
apart on the LGA 1150 X CPUs I believe
so that's no good we also have to worry
about component clearance for things
like the chokes so that's going to be a
concern and then the next thing is do we
want to try and keep this base plate
just answers yes I would like to try to
keep it but we've got a couple kits here
so I pulled out every kit that I have
for hybrid modding where you go through
all of them see if any of them have a
bracket that is adjustable if one has a
bracket that's adjustable then great
we'll use it if not then I have an idea
for a mod that we can do that will
involve a drill um so we'll see we'll
see how it goes but we're going to start
with the G 12 which I just have on top
here and is the newest I've only used
this once I used it for the MSI 10a DTI
armor video and I am pretty sure right
now that this isn't going to work
but we're going to check that's not
going to work there's just not enough
that rules out the G 12 I was easy check
the next one arctic Exelero 120 I've
used this kit before I use this kit on
the RX 4 80
these the heatsink yes the bag of heat
sinks I'm not going to open because
they're mean there they are
these are BRM component heat sinks last
time it took something like 30 or 40
minutes to get them all applied and
repacked is a nightmare so we're not
going to open that it's just heat sinks
it might come in handy but not what we
need right now what we need right now is
an adjustable mounting plate that just
uses a slide rail okay now good next one
g10 nope okay so we have ruled out the
g10 the g12 the Arctic whatever it was
probably this Arctic one won't work
either why maybe that one but
I have the most faith in this one maybe
not so looking more and more like we are
going to probably resort to a DIY
approach where's the manual oh there's
our spacing right there
58 point four millimeters is the biggest
one no good so we are left with the
drill route and here is what I've been
thinking of so this is an Intel mounting
plate for an a2 tech cooler the way it
works is you take something like this
cooler just short tubes but whatever and
you mount them like that to the cooler
so it just sockets on there and we have
clearance on the edges as you can see
where that metal isn't being used for
anything and we might be able to get
away with cutting through it so I'm
thinking that we take one of these and
measure a couple times and probably
basically end up cutting holes like for
drilling holes right at the end of the
second one already so that's probably
what we're looking at for this mod so
what I need to do is what
alright ok next step is figuring out
where the new ones go you want as little
overhang as possible where there are a
lot of MOSFETs or where the bottom of
the card is that looks pretty good
what do you think so that's good that
looks promising now we could use zip
ties to secure the cooler the GPU and it
would probably work here's the concern
we have a GPU and we have HBM and the
chances of potentially having uneven
waiting or positioning on either of
those are high enough that it's it's a
little bit scary to do that because we
don't have temperature sensors for HBM
we're not going to have a good idea if
those are being cooled and sticking a
thermocouple in there isn't going to be
the best approach either so I would
really like to avoid anything where
we're going to potentially have uneven
Mountain mounting and that is probably
going to be best avoided by mounting
proper retention kit to it so that we
can actually we can carefully screw in
with a nut in a screw on either side the
same amount of threads and distribute
the weight evenly now the next question
is are we going to have these Ashim I
think the answer to that is it will
figure that when we get there but
probably because these are flat plates
and the inductors are cut well yet
definitely the inductors are taller than
the GPU Serene ft is a shim we did that
with our 1060 mod actually know what
this is making contact will see did that
with our 1060 mod and it worked out fine
it was still one of the coolest things
we ever tested so even if we have to use
a shim we're going to gutter off in the
base or chamber
it's pretty good okay so now we need to
drill this I'm thinking I got to figure
out we want to take this outside
to not get metal shavings everywhere
there we go there's some metal shavings
okay progress that it's been dented
inward I might have to go to a larger
bit just because there's going to be
some inaccuracy here Steven doing
there's one is that Rob over there
let me ask him a question so we're
trying to mod modify something for a
video we're shooting and I need to
basically add in some holes right here
on this bracket it doesn't need to be
pretty but so I got one with a drill but
the other ones I started on it's just
like barely making a dent so I guess
maybe stainless steel or aluminum or
something okay
any ideas what would be best to cut
through that well what you need to do
versus the is to give it a little on the
side your ground drill alone give it a
little punch okay with a little punch so
that you get a little bent in there then
you could take some thin oil now you
have a press okay do you mind if I if we
record the part drilling through it oh
wait I get answer
that does look like it'll make a wages
here thanks for the help
he'll destroy endless
oh yeah
raging
Lou Oil City is going to clamp it down
ah
Oh
and you probably want to take a file on
this side and take off the right guys oh
okay so thanks to rob next tour we got
this sorted out and use the a drill
press combo to get through it so pretty
cool utility it's got five different
functions it's from the 60s he says we
were able to get through the mounting
bracket after a whole lot of effort and
now we're just going to mount it onto
the pump block and all we need for this
is the plates and then this little piece
here from ASA Tech which just snaps in
so that's our attention okay so that's
retained now the next step is this has
the mount here on top of the silicon I'd
be able to keep the base plate that
would be cool literally think it'll work
is any downside to this I guess is it
clearance that's the only question
that's left
so clearance now might be different than
the clearance before
50 no there's your problem
this is bigger so instead we'll get rid
of the base plate I'm going to cool the
vrm components with a lot of air just
fans I need to do this exercise one more
time to see if course definitely for
sure making contact everywhere okay
where you are clearly I am I can see
through the other side that's
unfortunate I can see through to that
side too what's stopping us okay no I
think it can maybe see through that
mmm I don't know what we're hitting
a little bit of flex from the PCB well
maybe this is actually looking okay now
so it just takes extra mounting force
HBM is not making contact the the left
HBM modules are we going back so do we
just put a shim on that make sense get
to the point where I'm getting nervous
about tightening this further I think
that's it I think we are making contact
maybe not on the far left and I really
hard to gauge what's the help based on
me
JC or shine it's very little
so they sign those for $600 because of
this because it's not a standard
mounting hole spacing and there are no
brackets on the market
click the minute someone like ek makes
one there's no way the $600 is worth it
unless there's something else special by
the card that we don't know yet this
site is good that's okay not this one oh
that's also good so that one lines up
with the silicon so we're good there
that means that the part I'm seeing the
light shine through is actually the
substrate and then this one is right
here which lines up with the silicon for
the HBM sort of get there put I'm
concerned about maybe although I may
have Oh
hmm actually this might be more okay
than I thought it was so this small mark
lines up with the edge of the silicon
we're good there this one I wasn't sure
about I was a little sloppy with this
because I was having so much trouble
getting it to mark it is more inward or
inland or whatever but where's the end
of it it's bends right there and this
HBM stack is inset that way by about the
same amount so it's close its close
enough to try it I think we're going to
be good because anything any light
bleeding out over there is probably just
cutting through that corner that's not
covered so let's give it a shot see how
this does will cool the VR rounds with a
lot of air and maybe some stick on heat
sinks that we open from that Arctic kit
earlier after good
good measure we'll use extra thermal
paste
today cool sounds good all right so they
all need to be same amount screwed in
 things on the bottom to get away
with that this clear video card slot
seven point you want to not quite sweet
so it's the same height for all of them
they're all the same height and it will
fit in a video card slot even though I
put the pump the tubes as angle I didn't
want to put them out but it's also
relevant put a fan above it or the VRM
do I want beer I'm heatsinks really
don't need them if you just blast the
pan it these are exposed copper anyway
thermal adhesive not they're all pasted
thermal adhesive not mix them up these
even the same height that's the real
question
mmm looks like it there we go 0.59 that
sounds more accurate 0.6 okay they're
all the same height
that's cool
I already know the hot spots can be
measured um earlier for the review so
it's convenient
HBM ones at the bottom just ignore that
one for now I get Celeste along
ok last 2 sets will be cooled with air a
lot of it and I put a maglev fan over
the stand and you wouldn't even really
need these technically so whatever as
the longest build up we've ever done I
mean even the part 1 and part 2 of the
first teardown and hybrid mod we did was
shorter than this building part the
teardown was trivial so we've got it
we've got the coolers mounted it's
making contact everywhere now I've
checked it multiple times I was
basically shining a UV light through
there and then marking it with a pencil
when I saw it bleed through and when I
checked where it marked it's bleeding
through in places where there is not a
die so it's good so that's making
contact first thing I'll do is check TP
temps anyway the BRM should be fine
there are two pairs of MOSFETs that are
not covered by one of these small
aluminum heat sinks didn't even need to
put those on there technically anyway
but the two that aren't covered are
going to be just fine they'll be happy
because I'm going to put a maglev fan
over them blast out at 100% and it will
all be good the airflow is better than
heat sinking anyways he's thinking
without airfoil so I think we're ready
to test it I can't move the card because
everything's dry but we'll have b-roll
shots of it and then check back for the
results where we'll have the temperature
and thermal difference we'll have the
clock stability difference if there is
any at that point the only limitation
that's left will be the power limit and
we have plans to try and deal with that
too
so check back for all that as always you
can subscribe for more especially the
results and the follow ups with
potentially power limit bypass attempts
