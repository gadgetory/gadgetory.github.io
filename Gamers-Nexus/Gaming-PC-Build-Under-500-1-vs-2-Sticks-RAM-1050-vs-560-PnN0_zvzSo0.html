negate the insane prices of memory and
the still recovering prices of GPUs we
decided to put together an ultra budget
build sub $500 to pound when you check
the prices and we decided to do a couple
different tests with it while we were at
it one of them is with the GTX 1050 the
other ones with an rx 560 and then we
did a separate test with one stick of
memory versus two at the same capacity
and timings to see if buying one and
saving a few bucks would actually be
worth it on a budget build for the base
platform reason a G 45 60 and an HD 3
motherboard and as always we'll have
links to each product in the description
below along with an article version of
this video before we get into that this
content is brought to you by the
Thermaltake flow RGB closed-loop liquid
cooler which is a 360 millimetre
radiator plus 3 120 fans that are RGB
illuminated the if then will take it
rain fans at that this is a 4.5 done a
stack pump which is one of the faster
pumps you can learn more at the link in
the description below so for most the
year prices have been volatile but
mostly in an upward direction
unfortunately they've been kind of
volatile the last few days though just
from things going on sale and coming off
sale the long story short of it is
originally a couple day 1 day ago two
days before this goes live the build we
put together was four hundred and thirty
dollars on new Aegon Amazon using all
the different rebates and sales
currently it's 450 but that's gonna go
up and down especially because when this
goes live it'll be Cyber Monday and
everything's gonna change again so price
is kind of loose but basically we're
going for under 500 and you may need to
choose different parts from different
vendors but they can still be the same
capacity or GPU or whatever it'll be
roughly the same to go over the basics
we're using an EVGA 450 BT 80 plus
bronze power supply that power supply
sells for $45 currently has a $10 rebate
if you count them whatever not a big
deal
but when we first put the build together
had a thirty dollar rebate and some
other discount and I came out to 12
bucks which is absurd it's because it's
not even like it's not even the type of
twelve dollar power supply that will
catch on fire it's actually rated
some kind of efficiency not much but
it's there for the case we chose the
course here 270 our this one performs
pretty well in our review when we
combined it with our 570 X review and we
have some thermal numbers for this case
as well in that review the two sony are
shipped at seventy dollars and we liked
it well enough then but now it's about
fifty five dollars with sometimes a
rebate that brings it down to forty five
which is about the price of a two
hundred our so that's a really good deal
if you can get at 55 to 45 it has decent
ventilation plenty for this system it's
perfectly fine for this setup and it's
actually a decent quality case you could
go cheaper you could do a $25 $30 case
and people like to point this out when
we do budget builds like why would you
use a 40 $50 case well building is
somewhat subjective and my thing with
these types of build is I want a case
that's not complete garbage
fifty dollars gets you a pretty good
entry-level case yes you could spend $10
less or $15 less but the threshold for
quality between that ten or fifteen
dollars is massive and go in for
something like a two hundred are which
is a great case for the price means you
can actually keep using it and not have
to upgrade it going forward all these
other parts are pretty modular you
really don't want to upgrade your case
because you're rebuilding the entire
computer so that's that's my look on it
if you want to buy a cheaper case there
are options out there I'll even link one
below that I think is halfway decent but
I would recommend going with a slightly
higher quality one if you can stretch
the dollar an extra 10 or 15 bucks
memory we went with G Scott skill
Ripjaws five eight gigabytes of ddr4
2400 which is all you need for a G 4560
and that memory when we first chose it
was $75 today it's 90 but there's other
memory kits of the same spec at 75 so
again just if it's not the price we said
it was when we filmed this I go find the
exact same thing by a different vendor
or whatever for the same price for the
motherboard gigabyte be 250 HD 3 we've
used it before it's this one right here
pretty simple board doesn't overclock
you
need it to and it's $55 after a somewhat
substantial $20 rebate 75 before
wouldn't really recommend it at 25 but
if you do rebates it's worth it or if
your retail does it that's worth it if
you can get it that price from your
local retailers rx5 60 or gtx 950 for
the video cards $110 on the 560 edge
review a 112 flat for the 1050 no rebate
required 124 I think for the 560 without
a rebate which is not terrible either so
let's talk about the one verse to stick
testing for a lot of PC builders who've
been doing this for a while from
experience I know that it feels wrong to
just put one stick in a board it's a
little bit asymmetrical and you hear all
the time well I mean that's just you
know that there's dual channel support
so it feels weird to not use that we've
done this testing before it did it again
in a budget build this time and
basically the decision was in a memory
market where one eight gigabyte stick
might cost a couple dollars less like I
mean as much as $20 less and some of the
prices we saw than two four gigabyte
sticks we thought it'd be worth testing
and seeing if it matters it comes down
to channeling so to clear up a common
misconception while we're at it a lot of
people say the phrase single channel
memory or multi or dual channel memory
quad channel memory they put the word
memory at the end of those things the
memory is not any challenge the memory
doesn't care it there's no such thing as
dual channel memory or quad channel
memory it does not exist
what does exist is sticks of memory and
then you put it into the platform and
then that platform with its CPU will be
a certain channeling capability in this
case we can go up the dual channel so
going down and one stick you lose half
that obviously so we're gonna be testing
that and then one big reminder on memory
the results you see here are not
conclusions that you can draw across all
platforms you cannot draw these
conclusions across the high end with
higher end cards can't draw them across
X 399 or $2.99 we're just looking at
this low input platform to see how the
memory channeling through the platform
do overs a single from the motherboard
affects performance so let's get started
with the game destiny 2
at 1080p for all these games starting
with destiny - we found the GTX 1050 was
capable of achieving about 60fps by
playing at 1080p with medium settings
whereas the RX 560 operated an average
FPS closer to 47 this was also with
considerably greater frame time
intervals the GTX 1050 ends up with a
27% lead largely thanks to the new
Nvidia drivers that helped out a lot and
holds close to 60 fps going down to one
memory stick we see that the GTX 1050
maintains all of its fps effectively we
don't really experience a performance
hit in destiny - by going down to a
single channel aside from a measurable
but unnoticeable difference in 0.1% low
values we're also only going to be
testing one stick configurations with
the fastest card in each game there's no
point in doing the slower one cuz
probably bottlenecks on that one anyway
moving on to Sniper Elite 4 at 1080p and
the high settings the RX 560 expectedly
manages to win this one given that
polaris does well with DirectX 12 and
async compute rx 560 ends up 9.8% ahead
of the gtx 950
Azra single channel performance the RX
560 with one stick of RAM ends up at
roughly identical performance to the
dual stick configuration and is
completely with invariance of tests
Total War is next this one was run at
1080p with high settings the GTX 950
maintains a lead of about 13.7 percent
over the rx 560 here with more
consistent frame times represented in
the 0.1% low values going down to a
single stick brains our GTX 950 s frame
rate down to 50 6.7 FPS which is just
outside of our margin of error we lose
about 2% of performance in this more CPU
intensive title by going to one stick
with doom using Vulcan on Ultra settings
and with no anti-aliasing but with acing
compute it does work without a a the RS
560 leaves the GTX 1050 way behind like
sniper the guard is again benefitting
from lower level api's the RX 560 ends
up being over 60fps nearing 70 while
maintaining ultra settings at 1080p
that's about a 50% lead over the GTX
1050 2 gigabyte card which also suffers
and low-end frame time performance in
this test removing a stick of memory
equates roughly the same performance
with no appreciable difference for the
RX 560
to flip the script the GTX 1050 leaves
behind the RX 560 in rocket League we
found with the highest settings at 1080p
the GTX 1050 manages 134 FPS average
with lows at 95 and 73 fps for 1% and
0.1% respectively
going down to a single stick of memory
drops us to 127 FPS average from 134 a
reduction of 5.5 percent this is the
most noteworthy change we've seen thus
far and is because the game is a little
bit more memory or CPU intensive than
some of the others shadow of war needs
medium settings in order to maintain 40
FPS in our testing and is one of the
more abusive titles on the bench
both the rx 560 and GTX 950 performed at
41 FPS average which is probably largely
thanks to the CPU it looks like we're
becoming CPU bound here so they are
functionally equivalent removing a stick
from the GTX 1050 test system saw the
same performance for no change in this
title we also have some synthetic
results for what is worth the first
chart is fire strike in this one our RX
560 option priced at $110 after rebate
124 before is led by the 1050 which has
a 3.4 percent lead and graphics score
going down to one stick we ended up
behind the tooth stick test with
invariance actually and that's the
graphics core looking instead at the CPU
score we dropped about 7 FPS off of it
and consistently and repeatedly saw that
this result is a 38% decline in
performance from the CPU test showing
where the change hurts the most in
memory intensive and CB bouncin areas
where memory is heavily transacted the
Moldy stick configuration helps the next
and final chart is four times by for
this one the RX 560 holds a slight lead
over the gtx 950 and the single stick
results are as shown on the screen so
that's it for the build this one's a bit
different normally we do builds as kind
of like here's the parts but this one
we've got a couple different options for
you so we'll leave it up to you as far
as the memory configuration that one's
pretty cut-and-dry for the most part
generally speaking in the games we just
tested with a G 45 to 60 and with one of
these cards not a lot of difference
between one and two sticks at the same
capacity and times that can change as
you see in some of the tests like some
of the CPU
found items where we drop some framerate
but it just depends on if you know what
kind of games are gonna be playing if
they're gonna be affected generally
speaking it looks like not necessarily I
hesitate to say buy one stick because
again there's that stigma that as a PC
builder for a long time you do kind of
feel like it's not worth doing one
because you don't want to risk running
into one of those memory bound 2 asks
and really suffering for it that said if
you're on a serious budget and you can
only afford one today and dropping $15
off the price your memory gives you the
next class up in GPU or CPU that's a
considerable change and might be worth
doing because you can always pretty
easily add another stick later just do
it within the next couple months and as
long as the prices don't behave the way
Bitcoin does you'll be in good shape if
it doesn't skyrocket another 5x if it
goes down which is more likely thanks to
Samsung spinning up more fabs then
you'll end up saving money in the long
run but that's the only one where
there's a pretty cut-and-dry scenario
the 1050 and the rx 560 do they change
who wins based on what game it is so
doom 5 60s in the lead rocket league 10
50s in the lead and otherwise the
differences aren't normally too big so
