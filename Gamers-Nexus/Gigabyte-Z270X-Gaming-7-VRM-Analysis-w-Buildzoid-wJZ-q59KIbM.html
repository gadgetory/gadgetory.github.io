going to be taking a look at the V RMS
of the gigabyte Oris Z 270 gaming seven
motherboard and this is a sort of upper
mid-range or lower high-end motherboard
depending on how you look at the price
point as it is priced at around two
hundred and forty dollars if you want to
go buy it so it is not cheap but it does
pack a lot of features and of course we
will see how good the V RMS are right
here right now but before the vrm
analysis this coverage is brought to you
by cyber power PC and there's cyber XL
gaming PC with an invertible motherboard
tray layout and some rise in Brandon in
the future maybe links in the
description below for more information
so starting off with the main V RMS on
this motherboard we have the vcore
located right over here and it is a
rather old layout but it is in fact all
vcore as was verified by with a digital
multimeter and under this you find the
IGP u v RM so i'll just write that down
IG pu and that is three phases and the V
Corps is eight over here you find the
two minor memory control memory
controller V RMS so this would be VCC IO
and VCC sa both are controlled by these
voltage two voltage controllers right
here those are rich tech r t8 120 s and
they are single phase voltage
controllers very very basic controllers
to be exact there now as budget
basically you can't get less features on
a voltage controller than one in this
sort of eight pin package however that
does not matter as both of these
voltages are very very minor in terms of
both power demands and importance on
overclocking as they really only matter
a huge amount if you are trying to push
excessively high ram frequencies with
very very tight timings and we are
talking like for ddr4 4000 and CL 13 CL
12 CL 11 timings which is actually
achievable on some very very expensive
ddr4 kits
what get once they are given enough
voltage so for the average user the
these VRMs basically do not matter at
all
for the you know extreme overclocker yes
you you would want to see something
maybe a little better than this however
unfortunately we can't get well I can't
get any details on the actual components
making up to the this sort of group of
VRMs or even how they're arranged which
is why I haven't split them because the
motherboards on the other side of the
Atlantic and these inscriptions are
impossible to read with how small they
are
so that that's sort of the situation
with that vrm over there either way it
does not matter a huge amount as they
are very low power and there's no way
you're burning those out even with very
high VCC IO and VCC si voltages finally
the last vrm that you really need to
care about is the you know the RAM well
yeah the RAM vrm right over here and
that is another single-phase also
controlled by an RT 8 120 from rich tech
and again it's you know RAM doesn't pull
a lot of power this one is a little bit
more important as it will have much more
direct impact on ram overclocking
capabilities as you raise ram voltage
however even a single-phase is plenty
for ram overclocking in most scenarios
only at the very very top end you know
you're gonna start seeing issues if you
don't have a well you might not even
start seeing issues you you would see
benefits from having say a two-phase
design or something more complicated
than just a simple one phase like we
have here so now that we know all the
nee RMS let's take a more in-depth look
at what they're actually made up of the
V Corps and the IEEE GPU V RMS are both
controlled by the inter cell ninety five
thousand 866 which is a really long name
for a voltage controller either way this
voltage controller is a 4 + 3 phase
design and as such it becomes rather old
that the V Corps here has one two three
four five six seven eight inductors the
IGP you've erm obviously doesn't have
any issues as it only has a one two
three so that three phase setup right
there
trans is you know exactly proportional
to how many phases the inter-cell
voltage controller is actually able to
put out for that section of the V R M so
the V Corps has to use some kind of
doubling scheme or it has to be cramming
more inductors per phase than there are
phases
luckily gigabyte chose to do the right
thing and we do actually have eight
phases however I am not sure how exactly
they are all controlled as the
motherboard is on the other side of the
Atlantic for me and we can't get data
sheets for these ICS in the v RM right
here and also I'm not sure if there
should be more of them because there's
only four and then there's no drivers
for the actual AI GPU v RM so this V R M
is kind of a mystery to me is with the
fact that I can't you know get my hands
on and measure everything manually so
working long distance this is an eight
phase-- v RM as far as I can tell but it
I am not sure how exactly those eight
phases are controlled so in terms of
actual power capabilities it is equal to
a eight phase-- v RM in terms of say
voltage regulation it could be slightly
worse than a well it's definitely worse
than a true eight phase but it won't
necessarily be on par with say a four
phase depending on if these are actual
doublers or if gigabyte is just choosing
to put two phases onto one control
signal which would essentially mean that
it has the voltage regulation quality of
a four phase but both are actually
completely fine as kb lake is an
extremely low power architecture and as
well as skylight and both of these are
compatible with the motherboard because
it does use the LGA 1151 socket so
pretty much regardless of what you put
in this motherboard it's not gonna be
very
it's not going to be negatively affected
by gigabytes you know interesting a face
he's uh design decisions however well
unless you start taking the system on
lnto and even on ln2 you should actually
be just fine I think unless you're like
- aiming to break World Records this vrm
really shouldn't be holding you back
especially not in terms of power
capabilities because the MOSFETs in here
are Serie well s IRA and that is
actually how it's done in the datasheet
18 dps for the high side which are not
super high-end MOSFETs but they are
completely adequate for the application
here especially with how many phases
gigabyte opted for and this one down
here is a serie and yep that that same
thing twelve DP so both of these MOSFETs
are made by vishay and with AVR em you
know predicted operating setup of 125
degrees centigrade 500 kilohertz
switching frequency which no motherboard
as far as I'm concerned has ever shipped
at so 500 kilohertz is sort of a safety
feature from my side for BRM ratings
because that 500 kilohertz makes me
slightly underestimate the power
capabilities same goes for that 125
degree figure as this vrm is an eight
phase-- providing very little current
with a massive aluminum heatsink on top
of it this vrm really shouldn't be
getting particularly hot unless you have
abysmal case airflow so again 125
degrees 500 kilohertz both sort of
overkill ratings my voltage rating is
going to be 1.5 volts which is slightly
above what you want to be running kb
lake or skylake app for 24/7 usage as
both are recommended to run about 1.4
1.45 depending on who you ask
so with these expected operating
settings this 8 phase vrm right here
is should be capable of delivering 256
amps straight to the CPU so no issues
absolutely no issues as kb lake and
skylake both have a sub 100 watt TDP and
even when overclocked they will not be
pulling much over 200 watts on to the 8
pin so that's before conversion loss on
the lis RM so really this 256 m figure
is a very nice margin of overkill from
gigabyte you'd probably have to put the
system on ln2 and do something force the
vrm to actually hit 125 degrees that's
the other issue here and then you might
be able to actually you know damage this
vrm otherwise yeah this is perfectly
fine without gigabyte designed it so
taking those same running parameters for
the eye GPU which you know I have no
idea how to rate an eye GPU because I
doubt anybody who who has this
motherboard is gonna use the eye GPU
like I really really hope you're not
using the eye GPU if you have this
motherboard for anything more than like
say checking that your main GPU works or
or something like that you really
shouldn't be using a GPU on a two
hundred and forty four hundred and two
hundred and forty dollar motherboard you
really should have a discrete GPU and if
you have a discrete GPU well this vrm is
completely irrelevant to you but on the
off chance that you don't have a
discrete GPU well I have good news for
you these MOSFETs are exactly the same
as the ones in the V Corps so you know
again Serie 18 DPS for the high side
serie 12 DPS for the low side and a
combined current throughput of 96 amps
across those three phases again using
those same running parameters so moving
on onto the ramp erm this is slightly
different in terms of mosfet selection
this runs only serie 12 so 0 12 high
side 0 12 low sides and there's two low
side effects inside the vrm which is
mostly an efficiency feature
as the low-side can significantly out
power the high side
either way this vrm right here delivers
a maximum of fifty six amps again that
same running spec of 125 degrees 500
kilohertz and 1.5 volts within the view
with the RAM vrm that 125 degrees figure
might be a little bit more achievable
but 56 amps is not achievable with ddr4
memory modules just no way ddr4 runs
again extremely low power we are talking
say about 4 watts per stick even when
overclocked they will not be pulling a
significant amount of power even if
completely maxed out and by completely
maxed out I mean 2 volts in you know RAM
voltage and 4000 megahertz frequency CL
12 se which is again achievable on very
high-end kits you will not be getting
anywhere near to that 56 m 6 m figure so
no complaints about that vrm from me
either
and overall gigabyte has done done well
on this vrm I'd love to know how those
eight phases are actually controlled and
I might have a slight suspicion that
maybe these two drivers aren't actually
part of the V curve erm but the problem
is there's also two drivers sitting in
the IGP you've erm and you've gotta
start questioning where are the I GPU
drivers because two of them can't drive
three-phase is there's no way that's
working so yeah I'd really love to know
the specifics of how the vrm is exactly
controlled but as a right now capable
current throughput wise no complaints on
any of the major V RMS on the
motherboard voltage regulation wise it's
always nice to see a true eight phase
but then again true eight phases are
extraordinarily expensive and very very
rare as a side effect of that so no real
complaints that gigabyte hasn't opted
for one here especially since it's
probably completely unnecessary with the
target audience for this motherboard
which is gamers who
wouldn't really benefit from a true
eight phase design anyway one last thing
to note about this motherboard is you do
have voltage read points buried right
under the sort of in that area there are
voltage reach points for all the
voltages on this motherboard so v core
Ram voltage VCC io v CCSA and every
other voltage you could possibly need
when overclocking a KB lake or skylake
CPU inside it put into this motherboard
and you do also get onboard buttons so
it does have some of the overclocking
goodies not necessarily all of them but
yeah the this motherboard wouldn't let
you down unless unless you probably went
on ln2 I think even for dry ice you
would be fine using this motherboard so
that wraps this up there is a full
