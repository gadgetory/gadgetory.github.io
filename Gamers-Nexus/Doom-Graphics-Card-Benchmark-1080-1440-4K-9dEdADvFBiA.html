Vulcan demo last week but it's not out
yet and Vulcan can be expected to be
added to doom for its API support list
probably at a couple weeks front we've
been told by in software and we saw that
and we're told that at the NVIDIA GTX
1080 unveil events of course we'll be
reviewing that shortly so that leads to
a quick disclaimer before getting into
this benchmark because of the new
architecture is right around the corner
that BGP 10 for the GTX 1080 and 1070
and then and these Polaris architecture
because those are right around the
corner if you're watching this to buy a
GPU for this game you may want to wait a
couple of weeks and just see how the new
cards perform because it's very likely
that there will be a lot better than
what we have now we're already working
on it but that'll be online shortly so
let's get into this this is the doom
benchmark we tested all of our GPUs from
1080 to 4k resolution including 1440 in
the middle and we ran on ultra settings
with a slight splash of medium settings
for the low end cards some of the
gameplay footage you're looking at from
our video is running at 4k ultra on a
GTX 980 TI just for reference and let's
start right off with the testing
methodology and then move along to what
the graphic settings mean as we normally
do first of all the components table
shown on the screen now is what we're
using for our bench platform and that's
the x 99 benchmark that we run for these
games that's fully detailed in the
article link to the description below we
used level 2 for benchmarking and that
is called the foundry the foundry seems
to be one of the most GPU intensive
areas of the game it's heavily dotted
with bloom effects and directional
occlusion mostly seen near the lava flow
and there are a ton of decal elements
toward the front of our benchmark
presence from previous combat and prefab
Elvins this adds some to the vram hit
although that's marginal most of the
heaviest effects in Doom take place
after the geometry and rasterization
process in the pipeline so that means
it's all pretty much press processing
and particle effects that are computed
it later we use the latest 1652 AMD
drivers and 368 146 unreleased nvidia
drivers which will be using for the gtx
1080 benchmark once that review goes
live testing was conducted at Ultra
settings at 1080p 1440 and 4k and we
used fxaa for
the aliasing we did not use temporal
anti-aliasing for this test but did
check it briefly and saw performance at
upwards of ten percent when using t SSA
eight tap which is sort of a GPU
agnostic version of TX AAA the temporal
and video solution for anti aliasing as
always we conduct a 30-second benchmark
three times for parity / setting for GPU
so again three tests / configuration per
card some medium tests were briefly
conducted to get an idea for low end
performance let's get to the results at
4k Ultra doom proves abusive on the GPU
and shows top-end performance of 45 FPS
on the GTX 980 TI with tightly x 1
percent and 0.1 percent low metrics next
the r9 fury x pushes 4167 fps and has
loser frame times but is still
reasonably tightly timed and the
performance gap between the 980 I and
the fury X is roughly seven point seven
percent just for an idea to get reliable
4k performance near 60 FPS you have to
run these cards at a mix of medium to
ultra settings with no real
anti-aliasing going on for the most part
unless you want to tank some of your
other settings fxaa is okay though
moving the 1440p we see this generation
of Maxwell Hawaii and Tonga GPUs are
capable of sustaining 1440p at
reasonably playable frame rates the GTX
980 TI tops the chart again and that's a
reference clock by the way with 86 33
FPS average 67 dot 33 one percent lows
and 60fps 0.1% low is very tightly timed
there and that is seventeen percent
ahead of the GTX 980 non ti which runs
at 72 @ 67 FPS average and that is
flanked fast by the fury X running at
nineteen point five percent slower than
GTX 980 TI or two-point-three percent
slower than the GTX 980 non TI all cards
for the GTX 970 and up are playable and
able to sustain 1440p frame rates at
ultra including the r9 fury x which
we've just added to our bench and the r9
390 x is more or less there but would
hit 60 FPS with some slight settings
weeks and i do have notes on the 390 X
in a moment finally at 1080p we see some
interesting performance metrics crop up
the GTX 980 TI pushes 1 30 FPS ish with
the i7 5930 kcp were using on our bench
platform and these are 9 fury x is lost
it's lead by the time we get to 1080p
and that is just because the fury ax and
other AMD devices tend to do well with
abusive pixel throughput just raw
throughput of pixels through the pipe
and the fury X still holds fast against
10 videos best cards below the high end
cards the near 60 FPS hitters include
the r9 390 x gtx 960 and r9 290x a bit
old now and these are 93 90 x and 290x
get obliterated by the gtx 970 though
and that's a performance gap of about
thirty nine percent and the 290x is even
getting beaten by the gtx 960 which
obviously that should really never be
the case with a properly optimized game
and or driver sets so we're not sure
who's at fault here but it's clear that
either doom is poorly optimized on the
softer side or and these 290x drivers
aren't working too well and we retested
this several times the 290x and the 390
X because it also shows anomalous
performance and validated on another
identical machine but still saw the same
issues so this is not a platform issue
this is not a software issue on our end
it's something going on with doom or
they am the drivers and we didn't use
the latest AMD doom ready drivers some
web searching did show that users of the
390 accent 290x have experienced similar
performance anomalies and frame rates
which coincide with our findings so it
seems like a somewhat known issue and
hopefully will be addressed soon the GTX
970 the far and away outperforms r9 390
X right now and performs effectively as
well as the fury x4 1080p anyway the
only reason that 39 DX holds its own at
higher resolutions at least against
Nvidia devices is because of the raw
pixel throughput that I talked about
with the fury accent ago Andy tends to
do well in such scenarios but that's
their brute force victory with the pixel
processing for 1440 and 4k resolutions
and it seems that a driver update or
game optimization update is in order to
maximize am these abysmal performance on
its through 90 x of 290x the fury x
isn't exactly where it should be either
but it's doing pretty well and is at
least somewhat close to the 980 tied in
some instances and that's not terrible
for the price though certainly you would
want better out of a card that's more
expensive than a 980 hopefully though
the drivers will resolve that just for
sake of sanity here's a quick table non
chart of a couple medium tests we ran
just
performance at the medium settings the
950 and that leads us to the next and
final question which is what video card
is best for doom and of course that
depends on your use cases and the
resolution for 4k you'll want either the
980 I or fury X you'll see that our
charts show at North a 40 FPS for ultra
but you'll have to drop that settings
configuration from ultra to something
else maybe a mix of medium high and
ultra and that will allow these 60 FPS
throughput that most of us desire
especially for multiplayer gaming and of
course our benchmarking was done in
single-player so your mileage may vary
with different multiplayer maps although
the course was fairly intensive as far
as 1440p ideally you're running
something like a GTX 980 a fury X or GTX
970 and I would mention the r9 390
accent here as well because it really
should do pretty well it's basically at
60 FPS but the performance is just
really a lot lower than it should be for
390 X and that's some kind of mixture as
i stated of the drivers or the game
software in terms of optimization and
that's just because the GTX 970 is
obliterating the 390 X right now
although the fury X isn't too terrible
but 980 is better value as far as 1080p
we're able to run something as lowly as
the 960 and the 380 x and this is where
it and these newer architecture does
actually prove to pull its weight a bit
better so the 380 x runs pretty well at
1080p ultra with doom and the gtx 960
runs very well at the same settings for
doom so those would be sort of your
bottom line if you want to sustained
high FPS and basically all scenarios
including the most intensive combat and
geometrically complex scenarios then
something towards the 970 would make
sense but again as stated earlier if
you're going out to buy a card sort of
in the next week or so maybe next few
weeks and you want to buy it for doom I
would say wait for two reasons one they
might release some kind of padua one of
course will be coming out and that may
show different performance for AMD vs
nvidia and then game optimization
patches may come out which would resolve
this weird 3 90 x issue and finally the
main thing to look forward to is just
the the release of the gtx
80 which is known to be made 27th the
1017 on to be June tenth i believe and
then AMD's polaris we don't have a
release date on that yet but it should
be entering the market at the budget to
mid-range class and that will be in the
next few months maximally so those
depending on what you've got right now
may be worth waiting for but that is all
for the doom benchmark check the video
in the poster all if you want to see our
benchmark course again with some brief
explanation of graphics as far as the
more in-depth stuff really the main
items are directional occlusion and
that's all done in the G buffer you can
read about that in our article link in
the description below if you're curious
about how that works and then the anti
AAA scenes the other sort of major thing
that people may not be familiar with so
you've got the normal morphological
anti-aliasing and that's SMAA and
there's taa which is temporal
anti-aliasing which means that it looks
at the frames one to the next so frame a
versus frame be the next one looks at
them determines which colors are
appropriate for which edges based on
movement that's a semi new technology
and pretty important TX AAA is not here
but t SSA is here and that is another
temporal form of super sampling
anti-aliasing hence t SSA that is used
agnostic leon AMD and NVIDIA devices and
is also temporal so it's over time frame
to frame those are the main things and
here people may not be familiar with the
only other one that stands out
immediately is chromatic aberration
which is exactly as it is in photography
just like that's the field chromatic
aberration is sort of a lens effect that
you get so if you think of those Michael
Bay movies where you see a lot of lens
effects that would be there's some
chromatic aberration there especially
with red tinting on the lens depending
on how it's perceived the light and
again article below if you want to read
more about that so thank you for
watching pay challenge post your video
to help us out directly i'll see you all
