order of ten puzzle that we solved you
can check the channel for that but it's
pretty fairly obvious that it's from
them because it does indirectly mention
Fermi it directly mentions Kepler
they're all related somehow to Maxwell
or Pascal and so today I thought it'd be
fun to talk about the GP 100
architecture and this is the GPU for
Pascal the 1st GPU for Pascal that was
unveiled at GTCC about a month ago in
the tesla P 100 graphics accelerated or
accelerated card so this is not a video
card for gamers it's a scientific card
but it's on the Pascal GP 100
architecture and this Pascal
architecture will be used in the gaming
cards in some form now they're gonna
strip things out of course that are not
necessary they don't want to validate or
build to increase cost when that can be
reduced so reducing cost by eliminating
things like HP m2 and some of the lower
end cards makes sense or by reducing DP
double precision or other things of that
nature so we're gonna talk about the SM
architecture or streaming multi
processors within GPU 100 talk about the
cache unified memory and HBM 2 versus
HBM 1 before we get into that here's the
specs table showing the GP 100 Pascal
specification compared against previous
kepler gk110 and maxwell GM 200 chips
there are various versions of Pascal and
the versions shown here the chip is
actually simplified slightly compared to
its maximum potential we'll talk about
that in this video
meet Pascal this is the GP 100 block
diagram on screen now that we showed
from GTC last month although the GeForce
gaming chips will be a lot different in
terms of their architecture their design
at the high level the low level is the
same it'll likely at least at some part
have the same memory subsystem but other
cards may have gddr5 or gddr5 X we don't
exactly know quite yet what the
so-called gtx 1,000 series cards will
have but Pascal overall is going to look
like this GP 100 is the biggest GPU that
NVIDIA has ever made measuring at 610
millimeters squared and using the new 60
nano meter FinFET process note from TSM
see all previous generation
architectures from both Andy
have been on a 28 nanometer process note
so this dice drink has been years in the
making the process shrink champions an
era of reduced wattage and more densely
packed in transistors which continues
the performance for walk gains that
nvidia and AMD have been boasting for
the past few years and he began its
performance per watt improvements with
fiji by liquid cooling the fury acts
which reduced capacitor leakage and
resolved other potential issues but it
didn't undergo the tremendous die shrink
that Pascal and polaris herald further
performance and power efficiency gains
are aided by move to FinFET transistors
which means that power leakage becomes
less significant this also marks the eol
for planar FETs
in GPUs as all major silicon
manufacturers have now transitioned to
the FinFET design FinFET transistors use
a three dimensional design which
extrudes a fin to form a drain and
source on the gate the gate encircles
the transistors fins and GP 100 has a
transistor count totalling fifteen point
three billion across at six hundred ten
millimeter squared GPI sized GP 100 is
rated for a 300 watt TDP and pushes 5.3
teraflops of FP 64 double-precision
compute performance and ten point six
teraflops of FP 32 FP 16 is also
available natively at twenty-one point
two teraflops on GP 100 but it's more
critical than it might sound on paper or
in youtube video it's mostly though for
deep learning applications that we won't
dive into here just as a quick primer
deep learning benefits as the precision
is less required by nature of the
backpropagation algorithm so FP 16
allows for reduced memory consumption
and faster processing because that
precision of FP 64 or FP 32 isn't
required they can benefit instead from
the speed and then sort of use the
redundancy and parity to check and make
sure all that data is good the tesla p
100 pascal card host 3584 cuda cores for
FP 32 and 1792 cuda cores capable of
double precision at FP 64 the full GP
100 will have 1920 FP 64 cores if is
released and pascal's p 100 base clock
rate just for reference here is 1328
megahertz and is 14 80 megahertz when
boosted pretty fast for a GPU for the
first part of this architecture deep
dive we'll start with the sm or
streaming multi processor talk about
graphics graphics processing clusters
which enclosed the SMS
then we'll get into a unified memory and
HBM 2gp 100 host 6 graphics processing
clusters orgy pcs each of which contains
a set of texture processing clusters or
tea pcs and for everyone TPC and Pascal
there are two streaming multiprocessors
or SMS in total there are 60 SMS on GP
100 with the Tesla P 100 accelerator
hosting 56 this is what an SM looks like
in the Pascal architecture on the screen
right now there are 10 SMS / GPC
accompanied by 1/2 that count of t pcs
or five total TBC's / g pc each s m
contains 64 FP 32 a single precision
cuda cores and 32 FP 64 cores or 1 FP 64
core for every 2 32 cores and these
stats are for a fully enabled GP 100g PU
so that will of course be different for
the gaming g-force guards when they come
out still though it's a good look at how
things work architecturally this is a
market reduction in total core count per
SM vs. max while kepler architectures
despite this though there is an overall
higher per GPU core count so the total
core count is higher with 3500 plus on
Pascal GP 100 but the per SM core count
is lower Maxwell has 128 FP 32 - 2 cores
per SM and predecessor Kepler had 192 FP
DSP - two cores for each SM the reduced
kuduk or count per SM is because GP 100
has been effectively partitioned into
two sets of 32 core processing blocks
each of which contains independent
instruction buffers warp schedulers and
dispatch units there's one warp
scheduler and one instruction buffer /
32 core partition each partition also
contains two independent dispatch units
per SM there's four total per SM and
each partition contains two of these
dispatch units and there are four total
per SM each partition further contains a
32,768 32-bit register files the SM
segments share a single instruction
cache unified texture and l1 cache and
for texture units or TM use each and one
64 kilobyte shared memory block passed
has half the course / SMS Maxwell but
the same register file size and
comparable warp and thread counts GP 100
can sustain more in-flight threads warps
and blocks partially because of the
increased register access presented to
the threads overall the core counts of
Pascal GP 100 is higher than GM 200 even
though the cores per SM are lower that's
just because there are more SMS but as a
whole this increases at processing
efficiency by changing the data path
configuration and that's something
that's only aided further by the move to
smaller processes and the FinFET
processing node the data path
organization of Pascal requires less
power per data transfer management tasks
and Pascal schedules tasks with greater
efficiency and consumes less die space
than max while also critical mostly by
dispatching to warp instructions per
clock one warp is scheduled per block or
so called partition as we've been using
that word or segments and that's all
shown in the sort of block diagrams i've
been showing on screen each sm has four
texture units so there's a maximum
possible count of 240 TM use l1 and
texture cache are split for shared use
unified memory most immediately benefits
programmers it reduces their manual
workload by eliminating the need for
explicit memory calls between the CPU
and GPU memory pools but it's still
useful to us as well as sort of
benefactors of this impact with regard
to Pascal specifically l2 cache is
unified into a single 4096 kilobyte pool
as opposed to GM 230 72 kilobyte l2
cache and that further again reduces
reliance upon DRAM which is huge for
speed increases Pascal dedicates a
single pool of 64 kilobytes of shared
memory to each SM eliminating previous
reliance on splitting memory utilization
between l1 and shared pools for more
detail on that and all the other stuff
we're talking about here hit the article
links in the description below because
that has more on unified memory sort of
a GPU version of DMA and
the SM architecture itself but now we're
going to talk about HB m 2 and HB M 1
which is of course very interesting to
anyone who followed Fury and its launch
Fiji first introduced high bandwidth
memory on Andy's fury X which stacked
memory vertically atop an interposer
which is then on top of the substrate
this reduced the physical distance
between the GPU and memory which reside
on the same substrate and was joined by
a bus with increase and reduced
electrical and thermal requirements each
stack of HB ml one uses a 1024 bit wide
interface capable of producing at 128
gigabytes per second throughput per
stack so it's 128 gigabytes per second
per stack and that can put upwards of a
terabyte per second depending on what
you're using in terms of the GPU
architecture gddr5 pushes a maximum
theoretical throughput of about 8
gigabits per second - per die with
microns gddr5 X pushing 13 to 14
gigabits per second per die VG it was
limited to 4 gigabytes total capacity
due to yields and cost but HBM 2 will
change the game in terms of capacity
HBM - relevant to Pascal devices like GP
100 will be able to maximally host 16
gigabytes of vram pursuant to increase
dye density of the new version
HBM - densities will run upwards of 8
gigabits with 4 to 8 dies per GPU
maximally enabling that 16 gigabyte
capacity although the initial p100
accelerated shipments will be 8
gigabytes GPU 100 HP m2 is a composition
of 5 dyes presented as a coplanar
surface to simplify heat sink mounting
and hotspot cooling basically it's flat
that's all that really means and the
stack starts with the base die then
vertically turns into 4 DRAM module
stacked above it and we have a micro
photo of this under a microscope
GP 100 has a 4096 bit wide interface for
its HB m2 with each stack running a 512
bit memory interface between them so
that covers the initial Pascal GP 100
launch and of course the geforce cards
we're all very interested in those will
be here eventually I don't know quite
when just yet but hopefully sometime
soon of course Polaris is coming out
from AMD Polaris 10 and all these GPUs
are moving to the new process node the
14 and Andy's case or 16 nanometer
invidious case FinFET process
from in Nvidia's GP 100 TSMC being the
the manufacturer of that process of the
actual silicon itself so that's the
basics of Pascal the or the in depth
basics of Pascal for more as always
article below it has all the charts and
diagrams and things like that and more
text which should hopefully help you get
through the dense information a bit more
easily
other than that stay tuned because we
have plenty of other content coming up
this weekend we're out here in Austin
for Dreamhack and we'll be talking about
some of the goings on there we'll also
be talking about very soon I actually
