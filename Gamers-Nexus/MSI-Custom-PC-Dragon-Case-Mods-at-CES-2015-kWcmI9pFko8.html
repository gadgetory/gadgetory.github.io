Nexus Don this is our first video from
CES 2015 pretty exciting just landed
here by the way and all of our CES
content is brought to you by cyber power
who are making the new cyber vapor
gaming console PC thing so I'm sure
they'll love that this is a case mod by
James Fischler and it's it's pretty cool
it's all acrylic for the dragons on the
fins and then they've got two gtx 980 s
in here the 4g edition and there is an
ACK x99 msi board so this is all i'ma
say hardware for the most part in terms
of things that they actually make in
terms of things they don't make it's got
a hyper x 3k SSD which is been around
for a while now it's a sand forest drive
I'm sure we'll seen new SSD is from
HyperX in a few days and then the RAM is
predator ddr4 memory and there's 32
gigabytes of that so that's this system
it's all acrylic it's a custom build
from the ground up and then the next
system is made by exotic PC this is
called the Elysium and it's using an
inland s frame so this system has two
970 s with white face plates on them and
it's an all-white design so the S frame
is originally a raw aluminum finish and
it's been painted white by exotic PC the
RAM is white the cooler has white
accents on it and then the fans are
Corsairs fans with white accents on them
so that is the msi case modding set up
this year pretty cool stuff we have
another video on the video cards and
some accessories so check that out in
the link in the description below see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
