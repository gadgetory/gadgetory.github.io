access net and this is your weekly
hardware news recap for the last week
and that was obviously Christmas week so
not a ton of news going on but
definitely some worthy items and the
first of which is the AMD Gemini GPU so
this has been known about since e3 2015
i think that be earlier this year where
andy has been producing a Gemini GPU
they've called it that's a code name it
is basically a fury x 2 it's 2 fury x
fiji GPUs on a single card kind of like
the 295 x2 and similar devices put out
previously and the two GPU fiji chip the
Gemini is now looking at a delay so it
was originally slated for a December
launch this year and obviously they've
missed that window so Lisa sue that Andy
CEO has publicly stated that they are
pushing back the Gemini launch to
quarter two of 2016 and that is supposed
to coincide better with VR headset
launches including the HTC or valve vibe
and the oculus rift headset so that's
their public reasoning for this now
other reasoning could include a better
ability to meet demand for the Gemini
card because Andy's fury x GPU the fiji
has not had particularly good
availability in the first few months of
its existence and that has definitely
hamster on and these ability to ship the
cards obviously in meet demand so
hopefully this will help meet demand for
gemini once it is actually available and
their public reasoning again is just
that it's going to coincide better with
VR launches last week we briefly
mentioned the samsung vs nvidia and
nvidia vs samsung patent lawsuits both
are ongoing and they're both about
patents so to quickly recap things here
and video one after samsung for patent
infringement samsung countersued nvidia
for different patent infringement and
last week we reported on how nvidia has
seen some attrition damage in this war
where they've actually lost one of their
patents that was invalidated by the
judge and that patent was a little bit
different it was separate from the one
that any video is pursuing samsung over
so it was definitely some attrition
there
and Samsung meanwhile just had a victory
in their recent court case in the last
week where an video was found guilty of
infringing upon 3 samsung patents and we
don't know the damages or if there will
be a product delay or product ban or
anything like that just yet but they
were found guilty of infringing on three
Samsung patents patents related to
mobile devices and that could include
the Tegra GPUs for sure last week's news
on micron talk about their agreement to
buy out the remaining shares of an Asian
flash and DRAM manufacturer which will
allow micron to buy those chips at cost
and potentially reduce their overall
sale or cost of goods and this week's
news is a bit different it's the
opposite end of the spectrum for micron
they're actually looking at their first
sales decline in over two years now a
revenue decline by quarter to of 2016
and micron is predicting a loss of five
to twelve cents per share for that
quarter with their expected revenue at
2.9 to 3.2 billion which again would
mark the first loss in more than two
years from micron the next news item is
a quick one from Palmer Lucky's Twitter
account the CEO of oculus VR and he
stated that oculus rift would begin
shipping finally in quarter one of 2016
and also stated that pre-orders would
begin in the new year so just after New
Year's Day we should see pre-orders
starting for oculus rift Palmer also was
quick to add that the pre-orders would
not begin without warning so they will
post some kind of public official
announcement before they actually just
begin selling pre-orders for oculus rift
the next type of hard drive technology
is set to arrive by 2018 which will
allow much greater capacities looking
towards the range of 2 terabytes per
square inch on 2.5 inch platters which
is a significant improvement over the
current cap of 1.5 terabytes per square
inch and that's not even necessarily
being hit by some of the devices on
market right now the new technology is H
AMR or heat assisted magnetic recording
and uses lasers to allow higher
densities but also comes with its own
complexities and downsides of course
they
month showa denko a hard drive media
producer showed their roadmap which
includes H AMR in 2018 and western
digital in a separate study was quick to
note that they're expecting a continued
growth of the hard drive media
consumption in that segment with a move
from 1000 exabytes shipped in this year
to 29 100 exabytes shipped by 2020 so
that is actually a ninety-seven percent
growth in total volume shift in terms of
capacity on hard drives but obviously
capacity is increasing as we move
forward so this all coincides with that
and H AMR is certainly something we'll
be paying attention to more in the
future and hopefully breaking down in
some sort of in-depth video so that is
all for this week's hardware news recap
