hardware news recap for the last week
this one is pretty dense so we have some
rumors of Intel's graphics card
potentially showing up in the next year
we'll see if that happens
also Z 390 chipset block diagram
detailed spoiler alert
pretty boring details and videos got
some interesting revenue trends pointing
towards mining income being somewhat
significant and we also have data on
what percentage of Nvidia's business is
gaming income as well in case you're
curious and thought that deep learning
an AI had been taking over Nvidia's
business printout gaming is still
massive so we got all that a couple of
more things for this week's news video
before that this video is brought to you
by I fix its brand new man 2 driver kit
the iFixit Manta kit is a universal
repair tool kit that includes 112 steel
bits redesigned from the ground up with
longer necks for four millimeter bits
allowing more precision when working on
components the $60 iFixit Manta kit has
everything from pentalobe drivers to why
drivers and standard bits
learn more at the link in the
description below first one is Intel so
they could be showing a GPU at CES 2019
major word here good because this is
basically a more or less weak to tweak
town where sweet town has claims that
some of their sources close to the
company note that there is a possibility
of having a product in somewhat of a
demo state by the end of this year or
early next year looking at CES for that
timeline whether or not that happens we
really can't say right now tweek town's
been accurate sometimes in inaccurate
other times a thoroughly
so I wouldn't bring a salt for now but
it does look like Intel might have
something to show that does seem like an
awfully aggressive timeline for a
graphics card showing from Intel if
you're kind of new to this they recently
hired Roger Kaduri former RTG chief at
AMD Radeon technologies group they hired
Chris hook who was the marketing
director over there and they've brought
over some other talent as well so we'll
see what happens but that's the rumor
for this week anyway and additional
Intel news Intel's e3 90 chipset block
diagram has been detailed now so this is
pretty simple if we put up a Z 319 X 2 z
370
it's kind of like spot the difference
basically Intel's are adding wireless AC
802 dot 11 support to the chipset
specifically with Bluetooth 5 added to
the chipset as well that's the primary
difference between them so you don't
necessarily need the motherboard to
integrate different chips for it now it
can run off the chipset other than that
there's an Intel wireless AC adapter on
the chipset and four more USB 3.1 ports
and that's it so that's the z3 90 block
diagram now the motherboards themselves
the platform can still have other
differences like power delivery for
8-core for example but the chipset looks
like it's basically the same thing that
we already know is e3 70 next news item
Nvidia and their revenue so and videos
the latest quarterly earnings it looks
positive overall with a year-over-year
revenue increase of 66% for record
quarterly revenue but had one standout
item on the listing cryptocurrency
mining GPU sales the company tracked 289
million dollars in revenue from GPU
cryptocurrency mining sales it's a
little bit nebulous how this is defined
because if you are an individual who say
buying ten GPUs on new AG that are only
used for mining it's kind of hard to
know how they differentiate that versus
gaming revenue where perhaps the 300
million in cryptocurrency
revenue is from - exhales - mining
companies or something like that so a
little hard to know and kind of nebulous
but their numbers 289 million right now
it kind of goes back to the gold rush
days where the people making most of the
money were the ones selling the pickaxes
in this case the GPUs most notably and
video breaks down its market platform
revenues as on a table that we've got
the company has gaming revenue listed as
the greatest overall still at one point
seven billion dollars constituting 53
point seven percent of their total
business revenue that's impressive
considering the company's tremendous
efforts in professional spaces data
center generated at 701 million dollars
or 22% of revenue with OEMs automotive
and a pro-v filling in the rest gaming
is still huge here even though mining
generated 289 million directly for
Nvidia and not counting whether cards
were tracked for gaming sales despite
Muses and mining machines
it looks like gaming is to learn more
volume overall in other news for the
same reports and video reported at gross
and
increase from 9.4% to sixty four point
five percent year-over-year so operating
expenses increased by about two hundred
million dollars which isn't a ton
considering their operating income
increase by that seven hundred forty
million dollars he's altering it in that
income of one point two billion for the
quarter gross revenue of three point two
billion for the quarter and then in
nvidia stock news analysts are
projecting that future down trends in
cryptocurrency hot topic could affect
the company's price targets so as
Reuters acutely tries to explain the
situation let's just quote them here
gamers used GPUs to play high quality
video games we're on track so far but
Nvidia's graphics cards are also used by
cryptocurrency miners to you quote build
machines to solve the complex math
puzzles that are in digital currencies
such as the etherium and Bitcoin almost
sounds like like some kind of Pavlovian
thing I guess maybe it is so that's what
they're saying analysts project that
price targets are now between to 74 and
$316 pending noting that data center
sales were down which was not a positive
but cryptocurrency more or less picked
up the difference and then also noting
that if cryptocurrency remains volatile
and goes down there's concern that
anybody will be down overall but
Nvidia's response that was that channel
prices for our GPUs are beginning to
normalize allowing gamers who had been
priced out of the market last quarter to
get their hands on a new geforce card at
a reasonable price so basically they're
saying the reduction in potential
cryptocurrency demand would allow for an
increase in gaming demand thus
theoretically offsetting it next one
rise in pro AP use AMD this week
announced its rise in pro processors in
the 2000 series including aps horizon
pro most notably we wanted to
immediately point out that AMD told
select press partners not us that it's
pro series would be better Bend than
even the enthusiast part so if that's
accurate and you can overclock these
things then buying one of those would
theoretically give you better
overclocking Headroom and then the
enthusiast parts technically speaking
the rise in pro processors on paper
don't look a whole lot different from
the desktop processors the 24 hour G for
example is still running four cores a
thread still
9 gigahertz boost and it's not really
any different than the 24 energy normal
processor the same is true for most the
other pro chips other than a few
guarantees like 18 months of software
stability 2 years of market availability
of the pro processors 3 years of
warranty and andis pushing an angle
trying to establish that it's CPUs are
no harder to deploy in a business
environment and an Intel CPU which of
course is probably accurate and other
primary differences include mostly
security features so those are the main
differentiators than the alleged binning
difference as well if you're building a
gaming machine though go with the
cheaper option probably get desktop next
one net neutrality was in the news again
in the past few weeks the push to
restore net neutrality rules put into
place under the previous administration
has gained traction this week with
Democrats in the Senate filing a
petition to force a vote on the repeal
of the FCC's new rules enacted by a GPI
current FCC Chairman the congressional
review act is the exact tool that
Congress and a gpi's FCC used to reverse
the Obama era regulations that is the
2015 open Internet order that banned
blocking content throttling paid
prioritization by ISPs and place ISPs
honor title to classification
however Democratic senators have used
the CRA to force a vote and potentially
remove the recent FCC rules voted for in
December the measure is something of a
longshot as it would have to pass both
the house and be signed by the president
regardless the effort is still
noteworthy and has gained support of
many tech companies mostly
internet-based
including Reddit github tumblr Etsy
Netflix and many other ones currently
the resolution has 50 senators
supporting it
48 Democrats two Republicans the 50
senators are looking for a possible 51st
senator to pledge their support
what's more forcing a vote would more or
less require everyone to stand up and be
counted so to speak and senators will
either be for net neutrality or against
it with potential implications for
future elections the CRA is currently
considered to be the best hope for you
storing previous popular net neutrality
rules but we'll have to keep an eye on
it and that's only included not to be
political but because it's internet and
Technology discussion next one antics a
high current gamer bronze power supply
line and I returned to Paris flies
recently with their high current gamer
line
the gold PSU specifically and they've
added two new 80 plus bronze certified
models to that lineup the hcg 850 and
the hcg 750 in the wattage both are
fully modular used Japanese capacitors
and offer dual ball bearing fans new
power supplies are 90 and 100 dollars
respectively with a five-year warranty
Corsair announced two new cases this
past week the spec Omega RGB which we
previously looked at at CES I believe
and the Obsidian 1000 d the former is
mostly not noteworthy it's this speck of
omega it's a spec alpha basically except
RGB ish and we showed that at CES anyway
1000 he is a super tower aimed at anyone
who wants to systems operating in tandem
under one roof basically that's the idea
of the 1000 d it's based loosely and
actually primarily off of the design
from the concept slate that we saw at
Computex last year and offers 18 fan
mounts
support for up to 400 for 80 meter
radiators telescoping radiators was
actually really cool by the way not
particularly this is a halo product case
it's meant to get at ang it's not
particularly practical or affordable but
the telescoping radiator supports
actually really cool integrating
commander pro and hinge tempered glass
doors on both sides it's a $500 case for
the 1000 d retailers currently show it
out of stock next Intel is requesting an
extension for inspector ng flaws pass
this is when we reported on last week's
episode the spectra and G flaws are
different from the spectra they are new
attack factors so it was recently
revealed that the Intel chips are
vulnerable to eight additional Spectre
variants dubbed spectra next generation
hence ng Intel initially plans rollout
of patch from a seventh but has
requested an extension on that timeline
and I was planning on patching the new
flaws with two waves of updates the
first ones aimed at medium risk flaws
and will roll out July 10th and the
second patch is for high-risk flaws
isn't it's not due until August 14th
Microsoft is purportedly also working on
OS level patches and unlike CTS labs and
their chaos the German computer magazine
heis IDE and their researchers appear to
be working with Intel according to a
normal and responsible procedure that is
not
the flaws of the public until the
vendors have been given a reasonable
amount of time to address those concerns
and develop mitigations so that's the
newest respector meltdown lately ek
water blocks releasing the hard tubing
water cooling kits so ek is put together
some new kits this time offering hard
tubing over the soft tubing normally
provided and seen on their kits the kits
will include the ek supremacy MX at
Universal CPU block an ek at cool stream
ste Radiator 240 or 360 ek Vardar f3 at
120 fans an e KX re s 100 SP CMS PWM
it's a pump in reservoir combo and also
cryo fuel which is just their
concentrate that you add to the
distilled water oh and also six 12
millimeter g1 1/4 tubing compression
fittings and 4 or 500 millimeter lon
hard tubes included as well so those
kids $280 for the HT 243 and $10 for the
HT 3 60 gigabytes next and they're
entering the SSD market so they decided
to jump to the SSD market making
gigabyte one of the few non memory
makers to offer a memory based products
by which we meet we don't mean memory
suppliers just like not Kingston not
course or any of that so it's a new
person to the business gigabyte plans to
offer an assortment of products from
nvme drives to use standard SATA SSDs
with nvme drives under ARS branding and
for the time being is offering to say to
the base drive is targeting entry level
gaming machines the UD pro series that
will see their first two models come the
form of 256 and 512 configurations with
Faison and Toshiba handling the
controller and 3d TLC and respectively
there's nothing especially remarkable
about the drives gigabyte will likely
lean on competitive pricing and bundling
options to that effects that I
versifying their portfolio with storage
products good gave gigabyte options for
bundling with motherboards and graphics
cards the new drives will cost $70 with
two three six gigabyte model and 120 for
the 512 gigabyte model
finally hardware sales for the week it's
getting better so 10 so TTI's on the
main ones to point out we had a news
article that ran on the site didn't go
on the YouTube channel that basically
was titled something to the effect of
Nvidia releases press release about
two-year old graphics cards being
available MSRP and
we appreciated their press release
because I don't keep daily tabs on the
prizes so yes it's true they are falling
down in price to about what they should
be
so the 1080 is around where it was when
it launched two years ago it's something
and the tens how many Ti is down to five
hundred dollars ish it's five hundred
five twenty which is not horrible All
Things Considered the last few months so
there's an e BGA 1070 TI at $500 will
link it in the description below there's
an msi 1070 TI also available between
500 520 depending on what you're looking
at obviously prices can change all that
stuff and then a thread Ripper 1950 ax
which is a processor we highly recommend
for the obviously the use cases you want
it for is down to eight hundred eighty
dollars not the best price it's ever
been but it's still pretty good
so if you really need it then we can
recommend it it's just not everyone
needs that kind of power so that's it
for the week as always subscribe for
more go to patreon.com/scishow cameras
and axes tops out directly and stored on
cameras nexus net let's pick up one of
our mod mats or one of our very cool 3d
logo laser engraves to tear down
crystals which is just a solid piece of
glass as this one back here weighs about
three pounds
we considered actually putting it up
here but I was worried about it falling
on my head so that would be bad although
get a lot of views maybe we should do
that check back next time I'll see you
all that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
