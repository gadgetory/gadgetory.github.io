nexus donna and we are at pax prime 2013
day 3 i am here looking at the infinite
crisis machine here at Corsairs booth
which is actually built by origin pc so
i am joined by George Percival the
technical marketing manager at origin pc
and he's going to tell us a little bit
more about the specs in this infinite
crisis build George first of all
infinite crisis is this is this a
giveaway system or what's the deal here
so yeah we have a contest going on right
now with Warner Brothers and turbine for
the Infinite Crisis game basically you
know you go to their website it's a
cosplay contest they're going to be
giving away this awesome machine that
we've built for them completely custom
painted all done by hand by origin pc
very cool as far as the internals what
are we looking at in this beast so we're
looking at corsair 900d as the chassis
that we decided to go with but for the
fact that it's just its massive looks
good we have a lot of room to work with
for the paint job so definitely get you
know you get a lot of a lot of real
estate there right so we can do a lot of
work with it um the internals are
maximus six board from asus well we have
a 4770k processor we have 16 gigs of
Corsair Vengeance course a corsair
ax1200i um cryogenic cooling from us
which is our custom liquid cooling on
the cpu we have 2 240 gb ssds i mean
this thing is just completely backed out
whoever gets this has a computer for
days I mean you're gonna be there what
running 24 hours 48 hours whatever it is
I mean if you don't wanna take a shower
you want to keep on playing the things
going to run it doesn't matter you have
two gtx 770 s in there from EVGA this
thing is a beast it's a beast it's going
to run whatever you want for the
upcoming years as far as you're at your
cryogenic cooling what can you tell me
about that we use coolant sandy k
products and Tom basically you know we
go in we take the best products in the
market you know radiators on fittings to
being water blocks everything that's out
there we go through a rigorous testing
process to see who we want to use as our
process involves you know as our
components of all this as just the
industry itself evolves who's making the
best product out there and that's what
we call cryogenic cryogenic is us going
out there
finding this is the best block out in
the market right now these are the best
pumps in the market right now so we
combine that together and together we
call that cryogenic cooling is the
system we're looking at right here
overclocked yeah so this is an
overclocked 4770k with this systems
running at around 4.7 gigahertz right
now the video cards are overclocked as
well thanks to the fact you know because
the EVGA GTX 770 s been amazing cooling
Tom so yeah I think with the 4770k
especially with the overclocks you got a
lot of performance I mean it's a great
great processor it's to me it's not like
the days where you can get out as much
as we want to insult made a lot of
changes but 4.7 is a very very good
thing for us because we can hit it up
more so than not that's about what we
ship out of it out of out of Origin PC
4.7 4.5 that's what you usually get a
lot out of it because that's what the
customers want so that's what we want to
give them and for our viewers where
should they go if they want to check out
Origin PC well you can check us out at
WWE NPC com you can go over there
customize the system whatever you want
another thing is guys twenty four seven
support based here out of the u.s. we
basically have an a skeleton crew in
Miami that will answer all your
questions we kept everything in-house
our support everything is in house
lifetime support of the system you know
you buy a three year warranty will cover
your parts for three years but if after
those three years there's a problem call
us up because once you were ordering
your part of the family our upgrade
program top-notch you by a computer a
year later the graphics cards are out
you want something new will buy your old
graphics cards from you you pay the
difference you got yourself some new
ones you don't know how to plug them in
there you don't know how to do anything
you have liquid cooling you want to make
some changes send us back the system
will do all that for you for your charge
Jesus awesome sounds pretty good to me
so once again we were at the Corsair
booth at pax prime 2013 and I will see
