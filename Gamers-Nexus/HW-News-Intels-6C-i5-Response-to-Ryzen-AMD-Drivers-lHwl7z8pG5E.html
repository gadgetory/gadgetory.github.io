hardware news episode recapping the
hardware news for the last week as you
might expect we're talking Intel coffee
Lake announcements and I don't know what
they were leaks I guess for the desktop
part so looking at some AMD driver
update news because that came out right
after we posted our monitor video and
that's got some interesting stuff in it
liquid cooling a video game info that's
actually pretty cool Final Fantasies got
some recommended specs or requirements
out there to look through all those got
a couple other things as well so all
that more in this week's hardware news
recap before that we partnered with
LastPass to bring you this video

learn more at the link below starting
off with coffee Lake official news for
coffee Lake largely pertains to the
mobile launch but a partner session in
China offered more insight to 8th gen
desktop SKUs of note the flagship i7
8700 K allegedly bumps up to 6 cores 12
threats the usual four core 8 thread
component and carries a base frequency
of 3.8 gigahertz goes into all core
turbo of 4.3 single core turbo should
reach 4.7 gigahertz and these numbers
are compared to 4.2 base and 4.5 boosts
on the 77 hard k intel's mostly
increasing poor count slightly just
enough to be useful in applications that
can leverage it but staying low enough
to keep higher frequencies and probably
reduce some cost so it's an interesting
strategy in opposition to rising cash is
also up now they're at 12 mega bytes for
l3 cache on the i7 SKUs rather than 8
megabytes well 3 previously the i-5
series is where the most interesting
changes are happening that go into 6
cores 6 threads so up by two cores total
two threads of course total that's
headed up by the i-580 600k the new
flagship SKU i5 components and the i-5
8400 9k both of which have the same
cache the same core account the 80 600k
will run a 3.6 gigahertz base clock and
will boost the 4.1 all core with one
core boost to 4.3 gigahertz the CPU is
also supposed to have nine megabytes of
shared
recache and then what we don't know yet
is the pricing so this is this is a
pretty decent shift for the i-5 line bit
of a shift for the i7 line it's it's
like finally some movement out of Intel
and whether or not this is something
that they've planned since before isin
the important thing is will the price be
affected because that's let's just say
that they had already planned to release
these parts if they already had this on
the plans
what Rison would still have effect on is
pricing so we can hope that the
competition of the 1700 and the r5
marketplace will drive down costs of
these six core and and and well six core
and well-fed parts so that's what we're
hoping for the other thing is the i3
specs chip posted by chip how so they
showed an a380 250k official source from
Intel at four cores four threads four
gigahertz clock speed and eight
megabytes of l3 cache and for the AMD
news there's a driver update for the
video card so we just posted that
monitor video about the CF 791 and our
conclusion was more or less this
flickering isn't a problem in Vega it
was a problem in Polaris and Fiji and if
you have Vega then we basically said
it's even look it's either a driver
Thane or it's a chip level thing and
because the issue kind of persisted on
Vega Fe we thought it was more likely a
driver than well it looks like there may
have been some truth to that assumption
so Andy's at version 17 point 8.1
drivers for the Radeon settings tool
just came out and they include quote
fixes for free sync displays may
experience stuttering on watch in full
screen video content that's been
resolved and free sync of brightness or
flickering issues have been resolved on
a small amount of Samsung free sync
enabled displays that may have been
experiencing issues so there you go if
you were experiencing issues here's what
I want to know we don't have that
monitor anymore the CF 791 so what I
want to know from you anyone who has
that monitor please do me a favor get me
17.8 that one drivers especially if you
have polaris or an on Vega card
available to you even if it's not your
main one and install them and CB you see
flickering
in the previous video we basically
talked about how it's very easy to
create the flickering launch basically
any game Total War or something like
that will do it the most get into the
range of 48 to 60 FPS with your settings
and turn on ultimate engine and then
observe you'll see the flickering it
will be very obvious to you if you don't
see that with these drivers and with the
Polaris or previous cards then it looks
like it's been resolved at a driver
level you do see it then I don't know
playing the display so yeah that's
interesting but the next thing is in the
game news front that's related to
hardware this is Final Fantasy 15 has a
Windows Edition release coming up and
they've posted some recommended specs
mostly for 4k gaming but this was
something we saw at the GTX 1080i event
probably in March and they were talking
about they brought in Nvidia brought in
some of the Final Fantasy folks to show
off grass simulation hair work stuff and
some other technologies and it looks
like it's finally coming out in an
actual PC version rather than just a
tech test as they called it then so as
for the game this was shown at Gamescom
it's a square Enix title and it's got
all the dlc and updates with the core
game coming to PC in early 2018 it's
being developed on the newest version of
the luminous engine it should see
partnership with Nvidia for their
proprietary game where expunction zaire
works turf works flow things like that
and here's the recommended specs so
quite steep but there's a reason for it
and so it turns out that when Square
Enix contacted Kotaku Hajime Tabata said
that was a mistake actually that was a
communications mistake something got put
in a memo that shouldn't have what that
is and that's the specifications that
went out to press is based on the specs
that we're running the demo on today at
Gamescom we can say now that Final
Fantasy 15 on PC supports native 4k and
also up to 8k as well as HDR 10 but we
haven't really revealed anything like
minimum specs yet because we're
developing at such a high end which
means we can't really define it with
current standards now at some point we
will publish the recommended and minimum
specs but we can't say exactly what they
are at the moment so those specs that
went out we're a communications mistake
by square-enix it probably won't require
a 1080 TI or 170 K bytes of storage but
we'll see it was just for the demo
systems at the show floor and the booth
and along with the square Enix stuff
there's also a destiny to news item to
look through so the PC version is
officially going to support 4k
resolutions big deal it's a resolution
that's kind of easy at this point we'll
have uncaps frame rates on PC so that's
good ultra wide support kind of
interesting 21 by 9 supported and they
also are saying destiny 2 will have a
full suite of adjustable graphics
settings that was shown at Gamescom with
some kind of SLI support included as
well so that's really all there to say
about that one but destiny 2 comes out
in the immediate future for PC once
again like we've done for the last few
weeks now EK has got stuff to talk about
so ekw b has an ex 299 monoblock coming
out and the newest one is aimed at the
gigabyte X 299 motherboards or five of
them it'll work with explicitly supposed
to ship this week machine from acrylic
and offers a redesigned cold plate to
offer more mechanical support for Intel
x-series CPUs the pricing on the
pre-order for the EK fpga x 299 is $137
supposed to ship august 25th and it has
an integrated RGB strip also in liquid
cooling news alpha cools got the ice
wolf 120 GPX pro which will begin
shipping as an AI o solution for vega 64
card so the ice 12 120 GPX pro combines
both a water block and an all-in-one or
closed-loop cooler with a copper
radiator
the base model offers a 120 radiator but
there's also a 240 option and the new
CLC is also compatible with alpha cools
existing ice bear expandable cooling
solution which we tested previously
didn't like it a whole lot to be honest
but we did test it and it did in fact
move liquid through the bloop but you
can find our coverage on that for the I
think it may have was called ice wolf I
think it was called ice wolf the liquid
cooling block for the video card
prefilled
that we hooked up to by his bear
speaking of the ice bear they have a new
420 ice bear closed-loop liquid cooler
which is one of the bigger ones on the
market if not the biggest closed-loop
solution we've seen how the cool is
supposed to be offering the 420 with a
pure copper radiator supposed to
refillable and expandable as to include
GPUs in the loop and the ice wolf GPX
pro kit should also be compatible
pricings about 153 dollars for the ice
bear for 20 quick one here in cases the
Lee Omni pcq 39 is finally making some
moves so this is a new mini ITX case
with liquid cooling in mind from Leon
Lee it's a small form-factor case and it
uses a cube shaped design with the Leon
Lee chambered approach so it's kind of
compartmentalized with the chamber
behind the tray supporting installation
of pumps and reservoirs and in front of
the motherboard tray and everything else
as normally the rest of it is grommets
for routing tubes and cables between
chambers and then there's some room for
radiators up to 240 millimeters with the
usual case amenities USB 3.1 type C is
kind of new pricing on that suppose be
$210 now this one was shown at Computex
the third will take view 71 is a full
tower case that's got tempered glass on
all sides side panel offers a
combination of thumb screws and hinges
for easy access the chassis supports
motherboards up to e-atx GPUs up to 410
millimeters CPU heatsinks up to 190
millimeters and it's got support from
fans and radiators plenty as well
because well that's what therm will take
mostly makes so 9 fan locations radiator
support up to four twenty millimeters
pricing and availability TBD the last
announcement is the asus rog Strix XG 2
7vq of monitor think we cut off some
letters there to make it easier on me
but that's coming out soon I guess so
we're keeping an eye on this one I don't
know that we're gonna review it or
anything like that but it's worth
keeping an eye on so this is a sixteen
by nine monitor eighteen hundred our
curve if you like that and 144 Hertz
refresh a paltry 10 MP 1080p resolution
with free sync via HDMI or DP and then
they've also got an RGB circle
back and logo on the back that you'll
never see after you put the monitor on a
desk and then also a little RGB logo
emitter in case you want the ACS ROG
logo in the middle of your desk in front
of your keyboard all the time for
eternity so that's what's coming out
I don't do we have pressing that $350 I
looks like an actually okay display if a
bit a bit excited on the RGB stuff but
that's it for this time as always you
can go to patreon.com/scishow saxon
stops that directly and you can
subscribe for more coming out this week
as always thank you for watching I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
