teardown this one is of the new EVGA
cooler this is an FTW ultra silent
cooler now they put it on a 1070 TI
because that's the latest card but this
might come to other cards later from
EVGA the big change here is that EVGA
although they've done some great things
with icx this year is still behind in
performance numbers whereas some of
their competitors who have fatter
coolers that's the nature of going with
a lot more metal so they've decided you
know it enough of trying to fight them
in a different game a different league
they now have a 2.5 slot cooler of their
own so it's pretty phat they actually
use the full three slots for the
expansion cover and two and a half for
the aluminum fins and all that stuff so
we're gonna take this apart today and
see if it's any different underneath and
how this might be relevant for EVGA
cards going forward but before we get
into that this coverage is brought to
you by ifixit.com and their Pro Tech
tool kit I fix it as refreshing their
Pro Tech tool kit in time for the
holidays you can find a link in the
description below to the Pro Tech tool
kit and other toolkits that iFixit sells
we find the Pro Tech and essentials kits
to be the most useful for DIY
enthusiasts ok so this is the 1070 Ti
FTW ultra silent and it's this is not
the icx version the HDX version would
cost entirely too much it would make
basically zero sense given 10 80s nearby
in price and even though we're not
really looking at performance or
anything right now we will but even
ignoring the price the performance of
this particular card in the 1070 thai
class we can still learn from the cooler
an EVGA is probably still doing stuff
with the cooler for other designs later
maybe that's what one would assume given
that it's a completely new design they
don't want ROI on it so this should be
quite a bit different from what they
have already at least and mass the
biggest challenge EVGA has faced is with
their two and a half slot coolers they
perform decently but when you noise
normalize all the coolers things like
the Strix and the gaming acts come out
ahead the Strix comes out ahead because
it's about this width so it's got a lot
more mass in here the gaming X 1080 Ti
also has a pretty similar
heat fin size or a fin stack size I
should say that - so similar to fin
stack size and larger fans because it's
a taller card but EVGA is falling behind
there and they're trying to make up some
ground with this card so we'll see if
they can actually do it and reduce their
noise a bit because by adding mass to
the fins they are going to be able to
run the fans at a slower speed which
will benefit obviously the noise levels
so what we have here is we're gonna be
using our new mod mat so self-promotion
right here this is our new gamers Nexus
mod night we are making them now they're
in production and we're pretty excited
about them that they are up for
pre-order if you want one shipping in
some time and hopefully January and they
are anti-static so it's an anti-static
mat comes with an ESD bracelet ground
point and all that stuff plug straight
into the wall to ground you so pretty
cool but for the back plates held on all
with Phillips pretty straightforward and
easy and it should just pull apart once
we get all these out so I will speed
through those and then we've got four of
the main spring tension screws for the
actual cold plate
are we stack oh there's a screw hidden
under the so this this sticker here this
is not a warranty void if removed
sticker EVGA won't remove your warranty
or prevent you from doing a repair in
the place if you break that seal that's
basically their from what they tell me
to determine if their support team needs
to do any additional checks once they
get your card in for example looking at
the thermal paste this by the way is
awesome this is a little magnet that
comes with iFixit kit we're using so I
think we can now remove the backplate
yes and here what you've got is EVGA
going crazy with thermal pads like they
have been since the ACX cards it's not a
bad thing so they've got a decent sized
pad here for the backside of the chokes
that's what that is on the opposite side
of and then we have a pad for what looks
like memory okay so they they only have
a one pad for one memory bank and it's
this one and probably the reason for
that is because it's as you can see by
the backside here it's adjacent to the
capacitor bank and the MOSFETs and the
chokes so it's gonna be the hottest
memory and they've got a pad on that one
they don't have a pad over here or over
here they probably don't need it though
this is the backside we're talking about
not the front side pads here for small
components around the GPU proper
backside anyway and let's let's pull
this off and just get it on the
backplate so it doesn't get stuck to the
mat
now for the heatsink okay my goal here
is to remove this without I mean to
remove the expansion and that we're
gonna have to high
okay so DVI we haven't dealt with one of
those in a little bit I still prefer
that they're on there actually but it
does mean we're gonna need another hex
head goodbye
so another giant throwing pad is EVGA
does looks like about 1/2 millimeter 1
millimeter pad maybe 1070 TI GPU which
is the same as a 1080 GPU and also a
1070 GPU for that matter so what we have
here is the base plate obviously take
that off base plate helps spread heat
from the underlying components which
include memory and the vrm so here's
what we got this is an FTW board it's
the same as all the other FTW boards
this over here is is not if they're all
bad it's just a foam block to help
provide some resistance from the that
side of the cooler when it pushes down
so this is just a brushed aluminum base
plate it has no surface area no fins so
it's not icx icx would have the pin fins
as they call them technically that
should help but it's largely a
theoretical advantage it doesn't
necessarily realize in any practical way
and you pay a lot more for icx we like
the technology on icx but for a 1070 TI
class piece of hardware it doesn't
necessarily make sense to pay for
because you could step up to a 1080 and
pay the same for a little bit better
performance at the same price as icx so
this is non icx you can see a little bit
of grease there from the thermal pad
which contacts with the cooler let's
look at the cooler and see if is this a
solid plate under here yes so they
actually have a solid plate what looks
to be actually not sure if that's
aluminum I would guess yes or if it's a
nickel plated I'm going to I'm going to
go with probably aluminum so aluminum
plate for direct contact via thermal
pads the vrm components and that will
touch which ones definitely got the
MOSFETs covered and actually it's the
chokes chokes are in there so it has to
be pretty tight to contact the mosque
as well doesn't mean it can't but so EB
J's got a couple different types of fin
design here you can see they have the
normal straight 90-degree fins these are
still out air to come through from the
cooler the idea of this is that it
spreads the heat but air can come
through and dissipated obviously so that
the fins can continue spreading that
heat and then there's these flat ones
which actually there's another one too
where is it
these these are they call these l-shaped
fins so this all has to do partly with
acoustics partly with heat spreading
maximizing the surface area by getting
that extra little L at the end of the
fin there on the end again you get into
territory where theoretically it makes a
lot of sense but practically it's really
difficult to actually test that and know
how much it matters but just wanted to
plan out the different types of fins
they use there's a reason for those fins
the l-shaped ones were introduced with
icx and the straights been around
forever flat is normally used for
blocking off a passageway for one reason
or another or for making direct contact
with something which isn't the case here
but it can be the case on other cards
underneath we actually have fan
connectors in here for probably a triple
fan if they wanted to so down there in
the middle there's a couple more headers
another four pin GPU fan header right
here that could be used to hook up a
third fan they've got two on this card
probably won't see an FTW three for the
1070 TI that'd be a bit excessive but I
think they have the cabling to do it if
they wanted to heat pipes we've got I
want two large pipes these are what
looked to be eight mil and then we have
one two three four six mil pipes I think
that's all of them one yeah I think
that's it - oh there's one hiding here
now as far as the cooler goes so the
heat sink itself is a bit fatter and now
let's see two centimetres thick for the
for the actual heatsink this is a bit
large it's half-ass lot bigger than the
other ones
as you'd expect let's look at the board
same GPU as every other 1070 Ti so
there's a GP 104 GPU and then we have a
shunt located over here it looks like oh
no here we go
so that one two three
so shunt shunt one down here as well and
four components I think it's gonna be
the same as the other FTW cards he's 69
30s for the memory of erm we've seen
these a lot on a lot of multiple cards
actually but especially EVGA so they're
still using 69 30s over here these are
on semi NCP eight one three eight ones
and these are 25 amp power stages and
they have a peak current capability of
60 amps as for the phase layout we have
ten of them so you can count ten phases
here so let's walk through the vrm a bit
this is our memory vrm right here these
two these are east 69 30s these chokes
go with those and then right here we
have 10 chokes and MOSFETs the on semi
FETs or the other power stages so 10
power stages and if you look over here
we have 1 2 3 4 5 doublers so it's a
five phase design it's one of the better
ones you just it's it's a doubled 5
phase spreads the heat out over a wider
area and it's more current capability
than this card's gonna need stock for
sure and
for the doublers okay so these are on
semi also and they are current balance
they're doublers as expected so on semi
doubler is eight one one sixty two for
the model and then what about controller
eight one two seven four so that's the
board it's the basics of the PCB for
recapping key parts here doubled five
phase we have two on the memory and the
cooler is an extra half slot larger
which measured against our ruler here is
2 centimeters exactly almost Oh actually
so looking at it this way you can see
some holes going through here that's
something else they introduced with icx
it's supposed to help a bit with a few
things like giving the air a channel to
be guided through once it gets down into
these fins so once you get into these
straight fins allows the air some places
to escape and dissipate some heat off of
the inner circle on its way out but it's
mostly to get heat out and or air and
heat out and away from the PCB so it's
ejecting that way it gets a bit away
from the board that we're not just
blowing hot air onto the board all the
time so that's the 1070 TI FTW ultra
silent I think it's called it was that a
bio switch - I think that's a bio switch
on the top as well
unless it's LEDs or something silly like
that okay yeah so there's the card I
don't know what it costs actually if
it's 500 bucks then you're obviously
entering into territory of 1080 class
hardware but the cooler is pretty good
so it's gonna depend what you're trying
to do we'll review it once we get past
all the Titan volts of stuff but in the
very least you can see what the new EVGA
coolers look like and know what they're
probably gonna look like going forward
for whatever happens to be after Volta
for gaming so that's it for this one as
always you can help us out directly by
going to store that gamers and access
net slash mod mat if you like the mod
map we used for this you can pick it up
there on pre-order aiming the ship in
January sometime
the factory and then if you want to help
