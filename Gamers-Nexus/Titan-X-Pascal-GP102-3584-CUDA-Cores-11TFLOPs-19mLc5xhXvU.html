head out the door for the weekend you
can see we should hook out our hybrid
mod stuff on the table nvidia just
announces Titan X again so it's not the
maxwell tight next this is now tighten
the X Pascal or what we're calling Titan
XP and before getting to the specs this
coverage is brought to you by msi and
their new gtx 1060 gaming x video card
so Titan XP I've only got the hard specs
right now and then I've done some
calculations to get kind of the rest
assuming that the GP 102 architecture is
the same as the rest of the GTX lineup
of Pascal and not more similar to GP 100
which is still pascal but has some
differences in how the SMS and cuda
cores lineup given the extra focus on DP
and FP 16 and stuff like that so what
I've got here for you it is GP 10 to the
tight necks it is a Pascal tight next
they're keeping the same name like
they've done for the shield I don't know
why they do it but they do so Titan x GP
102 dash something for reminder GP 10 4
400 is the 1080 GP 1 04 dash 200 is a
10-7 tgp 106 dash 400 is the GTX 1060
it's got 12 billion transistors it's
still 16 nanometer FinFET we're looking
at 3584 cuda cores and these are all
things we know for certain by the way
1530 megahertz boost clock don't know
the core clock but is 1530 megahertz
boosted 11 teraflops of compute f p32
that's a pretty big deal and what Nvidia
was pushing the most 12 gigabytes of
gddr5 x and that is by micron likely 10
gigabits per second or 10 gigahertz same
thing so what we saw in the 1080 as well
384-bit memory interfaces what I'm
guessing based on numbers because one of
the numbers we have is a 480 gigabyte
per second memory bandwidth that's known
also known I'll get second release date
and a 1200 dollar price point on that
card in terms of things we've calculated
assuming this is similar architecture
again to the 1080 with a 128 core / sm
setup then we'd be looking at with 3584
cuda cores likely 6g pcs containing 28
SMS or simultaneous multiprocessors
which can which are accompanied by 28 t
pcs and that would also give us to 2040
mu
texture map units other numbers were
getting based on crunching again 384-bit
memory interface which we've kind of
drives partially from the 480 gigabyte
per second memory bandwidth and the
known or assumed memory clock of 10
gigabits per second effective so that's
what we're looking out for the Titan X
you can hit the link in the description
below for the article that we've already
published on this just a quick news
update again will be available August
second i'm not sure if we're getting
review sample this one but if we do i'll
run some production workloads on it as
well as the normal game and we're closed
because just a reminder this is sort of
a production card you can certainly buy
it for gaming but i don't know
necessarily why you do that it's a lot
of money the high-end stuff is already
pretty good maybe if you want we were
desperate for something like 4k 144
something like that but it is definitely
going to be better for production like
video rendering animations things like
that so as always pay channeling
commercial eight if you wanna help us
out directly link the description below
for more information subscribe if you
want to see more content and I'll see
you all next time
