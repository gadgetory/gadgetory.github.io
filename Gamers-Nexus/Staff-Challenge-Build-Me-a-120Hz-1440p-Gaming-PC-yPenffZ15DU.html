this video using only parts from our
inventory sheet assemble a gaming
computer that can play 120 Hertz with
1440p and high settings also keep it up
close $1700 as possible we know we can
hit 144 Hertz of 1080p of course of
movies with 1440p while avoiding
multi-gpu does complicate the aims of
this
refresh was dropped to 120 Hertz to make
the challenge more achievable that would
also almost certainly necessitates
overclocking something we'll explore
here before getting to the build this
coverage is brought to you by catalyst
energy Mint's a three-pack catalyst
contains the equivalent energy of over
21 energy drinks and that $20 works out
to be more affordable and portable than
the energy drink alternative use code
gamers nexus for 5% off at the link of
the description below this build was
largely a two-man project Eric Hamilton
writer for the website gamers Nexus
thought net and patrocles and work
together to pull together the parts
without going outside of inventory or
what I had available so that means no
external purchases were supposed
complicate things a bit part of this of
course meant they immediately pulled my
i7 7700 K out of the game and pro carbon
for use in the build which is here by
the way and we did run into thermal
issues with the gigabyte gaming 7 to the
Pro carbon ended up being included in
this but the gaming sevens did have an
update so I'll have more info for you on
that this week they also threw a GTX
1080s CW into the mix as it's our
highest clocked card we have and to save
on budget
a further object for kit of 8 gigabytes
of memory but it's easily overclocked
memory so we're running what is natively
a 32 hundred megahertz corsair dominator
platinum kit but since this build has an
objective of high speed to meet a
challenge they shaved off dollars from
higher capacities and opted instead for
easy overclocking as for other parts to
team tossed in a Samsung 850 Evo for the
SSD a Seagate Barracuda could drive for
the two terabytes of hard disk storage
and then pulled out a dusty Corsair 600
C that we like the thermals for I think
last year when tested it but it's been
in storage since then so it has to be
cleaned off a bit other than that the
power supply used is the same one that
we use for our case testing benchmarks
and that
that Corsair rmx to these power supply
and then we've got the 1080 FTW for the
video card and one case pan with the
rest taken care of by the liquid cooler
cooling on the I 777 100k isn't easy as
it turns out and that is especially true
with overclocking for cooling that my
Kraken X 62 to 80 millimeter cooler was
looted from its carton and front mounted
in the 600 C we found this cooler
somewhat necessary for overclocking with
77 on TK in the review depending on the
motherboard but the case of course also
changes that could no longer open air
and this depends largely on V core
settings fortunately that won't matter
as much because we're manually tuning as
for the motherboard we found that our
MSI tomahawk Z 270 boards shown in some
b-roll shots of this build limited our
overclocks
to around 4.8 gigahertz so that was
later swapped for an MSI gaming Pro
carbon instead we're hitting a cpu OC of
5.1 gigahertz with that board memory was
able to sustain almost 38 hundred
megahertz or thereabout with the CL 16
timing and we later overclock the GPU by
another 100 to 125 megahertz offset from
base so how did we do well we didn't
quite hit the 120 Hertz mark with games
at their higher settings because part of
my requirement was more Triple A games
that have come out recently like
watchdogs to that's very ambitious
battlefield 1 and GTA 5 it's bit old now
but still pretty high-end in terms of
graphics it's not hard to hit csgo
rocket League dota 2 those types of
games with 120 or even 144 Hertz at
1440p with this set up that would not be
an issue at all but doing this was a bit
different so as you might expect it was
hard to get those higher frame rates
with GTA 5 we achieves 123 FPS average
after all overclocking was applied
though held a 114 FPS average with
slightly lower low values prior to
overclocking this one actually makes the
mark of 1440p with 120 Hertz refresh and
does pretty well at sustaining it on
your load there are some scenarios that
drop us below 120 Hertz like some
timescale shift in but not many
watchdogs to however isn't so friendly
even with the overclock we're only
getting two 90.5 fps
1440p with high settings it be possible
to hit higher refresh settings with
dropped quality but this game is
somewhat of a bear to work with anyway
and you still have trouble getting up to
that 120 number what battlefields 1 we
can just barely hit 120 FPS average
after all the overclocking and after
dropping settings from ultra too high
still that's not with a 64 player server
so once you get into multiplayer FPS
will fall hard under those conditions
and you'd likely need to drop the
settings to 1080p for resolution and
maybe be able to keep quality at high we
ran some of these games at 1080p as well
by the way just for reference and saw
battlefield 1 and GTA 5 both exceeding
requirements for 144 Hertz gaming but
again that's at 1080p with a GTX 1080 so
it's a very expensive system for 1080p
but if you want high refresh I guess
that's what you have to do for these
games just for fun we also ran a blender
workload on the GPU and saw the render
finish in about 22 minutes given that
the CPU rendering we're closed we're
taking something like 42 minutes without
the overclock that's a big advantage for
the GPU enables rendering and cuda helps
with that because we're dropping the
render time by about half and just to
round out the testing we do the simple
noise has been temperature test on the
rig as well we were hitting about 30 DBA
with silent settings on the Kraken and
on the rear case fan 35 DBA
with medium noise settings and 51.5 DB a
bit loud with performance focus settings
and 100% fan speeds with a gaming
workload only and without using our
normal Delta's here since it was a
one-off test the GPU was hitting 82
Celsius with a 55% fan speed on the GPU
TV temperature under this workload with
performance settings for the cooler
stayed around or below 50 C and that's
again with the gaming workload when we
tortured both the CPU and GPU
simultaneously with synthetic workload
we were easily hitting 98 C on the CPU
but that was wasn't prime95 and fir mark
Ronnie had the same time on an open-air
bench we can stay below 90 C under these
conditions but boxing it all into one
case really shows the difference because
we're having trouble exhaust in that
area as fast as it's heating up this is
more of a one-off project for the
weekends but it shows that we're kind of
approaching those higher refresh
capabilities with 1440p with modern
hardware and that's a cool thing to see
because like we stated with the RX 480
and gtx 1060 when they launched 1440p
gaming is pretty much something that can
be widespread now as soon as people
start adopting the monitors because any
200 plus solid GPU can handle reasonable
if not high or ultra settings at 1440
with a 60 FPS plus frame rate for the
most parts here are reviews for more on
that of course but when you look at the
higher refresh is like 120 Hertz this is
pretty much getting there with some of
these games GTA 5 and battlefields are
in the maybe territory GTA 5 definitely
battlefield 1 too big maybe depending on
how large the servers already that you
play on 144 Hertz is still out of range
but with 1080p not a problem at all
especially if you are ok with going for
high settings instead of ultra 144 Hertz
with even battlefield 1 in this rig at
high ish settings was achievable and
that's again not something that's really
been possibly for this latest generation
of course veo will be interesting to see
as well for the very same reason if
you're playing things like csgo and
rocket League and eSports titles where
you might more likely want 144 Hertz as
a refresh because you feel like you can
actually see the difference or feel the
input difference things like that that's
been possible for a while now but this
does it a little bit higher resolution
the higher settings so interesting
project fun to do will post a build list
in the description below if you want to
buy any of the parts used in this PC
build along with the article that
contains the full write-up of all the
parts it's really targeted at people who
are building their first system in terms
of just like a guide of how to build it
so many of you won't need the guide
step-by-step how to put it together but
it's there if anyone wants it as always
