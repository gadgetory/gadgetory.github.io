score g21 TGK since we saw at Computex
at which point the fan configuration was
unfine alized for the otherwise design
complete case the g21 departs from an
industry trend of closed off front
panels to instead revert to mesh
paneling something we haven't seen too
much of in the last few years this
permits better airflow under the right
fan configuration today we're reviewing
all the ups and downs of the Thermaltake
core g21
TG with a heavy focus on fan replacement
and optimization of positioning of fan
and removing dust filters to improve
performance before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by our 10
year anniversary edition shirt which has
an explosion design layout on the front
the shirt comes in both teal and gray
with tri-blend and cotton materials and
celebrates the 10th year since we
started designing gamers Nexus dotnet
ultimately leading to its launch about
nine and a half years ago you go to
gamers next to us about squarespace.com
to pick up one of the shirts this is the
thermal take cord g21 we showed it at
Computex and talked about how it was not
yet finalized at the time but now it is
clearly we haven't and reviewing it
today now the thing of this case is it's
trying to take a lower price point
approach to the tempered-glass trend
we're kind of entering into the tail end
of that trend as the industry starts
looking for new things to chase after
but tempered glass is still a thing
that's going on right now and will
probably stick around for a while
because the quality is high is just a
matter of price and now that tempered
glass has become so widespread the price
can come down a bit so we have these $70
cases like this one where it's got two
tempered glass side panels up until just
recently this was really pretty much
unheard of for any case of tempered
glass side panels so that's the new
theme this year is bringing price down
of that the right side over here camera
right is darkened so it sort of obscures
the cables but not completely left side
is clear and you can see through it as
usual but other than the glass it's
really a focus on power supply shroud
some cable management features and most
of the things we've seen finally become
adopted in the industry as the new
direction for case design with one
exception and that is the front of the
case where Thermaltake has gone
back to the mesh focus design rather
than the solid fronts that we see on
something like an s3 40 for example so
from our perspective that's a good thing
we've always preferred mesh because our
focus tends to be more performance
driven rather than looks driven and you
can certainly have performance and
science in some extent though never as
well as if you just focused on one of
course the difference here is that
thermaltake is shipping this with one
fan so they've got one fan in the back
it is a pretty cheap fan unfortunately
and it's setup in an exhaust
configuration this is a bit odd we'll
talk about why in a little bit the front
comes with no fans pre-installed but you
could install two 140s or three 120 s or
of course radiators of equivalent sizes
up front it's just that they don't do
that for you stock front also has a
couple of dust filters so there's the
mesh front panel behind which and
mounted too which is a dust filter
that's a bit wider grain holes are they
less fine and then behind that is a
magnetic dust filter that attaches to
the front of the chassis and then you
have your fans and the intake to the
case let's go through the layout before
we do the performance the fold glass
panels sharp angles and sort of full
shroud but the g20 one the same visual
category as the NZXT s340 elite although
the mesh front panel and prominent
thermal take badge detract from the
sleekness somewhat narrow black borders
on the tempered-glass side panel leave
every part of the interior visible and
both the border and screw holes are
conveniently symmetrical so that the
panel can't accidentally be installed
upside down oddly the backside panel is
also translucent although tinted the
darker shade this means that cables and
drives tucked behind the motherboard are
visible from the outside especially if
they are white
so despite Thermaltake charming
description of this decision on the
Newegg page quote to town - tinted glass
for the look up front while keeping the
business in the back this puts much more
pressure on the user to bundle the
cables neatly as for the build process
as described by Patrick Layton and our
written article review link for the
description below there we'll take the
service of praise for putting catches
below there side panels we're working
with the s3 40 elites or the BitFenix
Shogun you required constant vigilance
to avoid dropping heavy panels while
removing them as they can easily slip
off their mounts and main on the table
not enough to be dangerous but enough to
scare away chief and the analyst
snowflake so thermal takes decision to
put catches with a market improvements
we hope to see more of it that'll take
panels are secured by catches until
they're hinged to about 45 degrees they
can also provide leverage for pressing
down the glass on bolting cables
although glass and leverages aren't
necessarily concepts that should be put
together but that's okay the cord g21
has plenty of room for cable management
and aligns with the Fraxel define c4 its
abundant cable in space and easy routing
of front panel headers the g21 adds two
separate sheets of metal for the forward
section of the case near the FPC and the
rear section near the motherboard back
side a gap between the two permits easy
cable channeling and the cables brace
against normal tie points the front
panel is one thing other than glass that
really makes the g21 stand out it's all
mesh as the silverstone are l06 proved
this can allow for serious airflow
unfortunately Thermaltake doesn't take
advantage of their biggest
differentiator and a market dominated by
cases with closed front panels only one
fan is included with the g21
it looks and feels cheap and if a
reasonably priced tempered glass case
that cuts its MSRP by excluding fan
sounds familiar it might be because of
our n1 303 review where our review
sample is shipped with zero fans fans
are one of the best places to cut costs
and enclosures and is where thermaltake
decided to do it with this one make
sense they allocated their cost to
tempered glass instead rather than
forcing the consumer to pay for cheap
fans that they'll have to replace then
we'll take things that the customer can
rather save their money and buy the fans
they want that's the approach anyway on
the other hand shipping a case with no
fans or with garbage bans that means
that some customers will feel cheated
and at least one will accidentally cook
their PC when they don't realize that
included zero phantom that they should
have bought some that's why i
thermaltake included one but it should
probably be in the front instead this is
a tremendous oversight and missed
opportunity by Thermaltake they have a
really good case the foundation is it
combines all the elements that we look
for in modern case design for a mid
Tower of this approach it's got a power
supply shroud with some cutout for
larger radiators or potential open loop
combinations it has great cable
management options it has good isolation
of the front and the back parts of the
case so you can really separate those
components out and keep them in their
own compartments without having a
compartmentalized case and it's got a
tempered glass on both sides necessarily
got a price point
everything looks pretty good and it has
a mesh front so it can actually breathe
unfortunately thermaltake decided to
include a single fan it's in the rear as
exhaust which is probably the least
necessary position depending on what
type of system you're working with and
it's not a very good fan so they've had
a big oversight here it's of course an
attempt to drive costs down elsewhere
because they have higher costs and
things like the glass and invested there
but in the very least we would have
liked to seat they don't take get a
better fan and probably place it in the
front instead though we have some
testing where we actually did that
ourselves move stuff around remove
different combinations of the two and a
half front mesh intakes to see how much
performance improves by getting rid of
one of the magnetic dust filters for
example and overall there's a lot of
potential here in this mesh front
paneling that's just being wasted and
sure the user can buy fans but that's
not normally the way that things worked
when you're looking at cases on the
market you see $70 case and you start
looking at other $70 cases and those are
what you compare if some of them have
better cooling configuration stock they
might get selected over this one even
though it's quite a good case other than
the cooling as we'll get into in a
moment so it's something that they could
improve on and the thing is yes you can
buy more fans and fix it as we'll talk
about but it does require some
additional changes as well
momentarily see that the thing is once
you go from 70 to adding to fans now
you're at 70 plus the cost of two fans
you're an 85 or $90 case a lot of really
good cases at 85 or 90 dollars and the
competition gets a whole lot fiercer
once you get to that price point you
start seeing things like the Corsair 400
C which is sort of a different class 70
versus ninety to a hundred dollars big
change but if it's seventy plus two fans
now the 400 C is a competing option so
something to think about for both
Thermaltake and its potential customers
but let's get into the test
look at how the different fan
orientations impacted things
we first wanted to establish an
understanding for how the Thermaltake
Porgy 21 TG performs stand alone after
initial torture tests we ran additional
configurations that involve new fans
removal of dust filters and
reconfiguration of the front of the case
entirely
we'll get the comparative benchmark
results next but let's start here during
the hour torture workload that burns the
CPU and GPU simultaneously the stock
configuration of the case with a single
rear fan and both front dust filters
produced a load temperature of 65.9
cells is delta T over ambient idle
rested at 7.5 C delta T with an ambience
of about 23 to 24 C just as a note that
puts you under ACP temperature of about
90 C on our test bench definitely a bit
warm and getting too uncomfortable
levels especially since an extra
increase in ambient to 30 C puts you at
throttle point in an effort to
understand why temperatures were so high
on a case that has good ventilation we
next added to AF 140 fans from Corsair
to the front alongside the rear exhaust
fan staying in there the result wasn't
much better almost surprisingly we only
improved our CPU load number two by
three Celsius with idle improves by
about two Celsius this puzzled us so we
set forth on a mission to perform far
more tests than we'll ever get ROI for
on this review maybe in the front panel
was next which improved temperatures by
three Celsius to 65 in the stock single
fan configuration and barely changed
anything in the dual intake
configuration with Corsair we next
remove the magnetic dust filter behind
the front panel and then put that front
panel back on without the dust filter
behind it and finally we discovered the
root cause of the issue
removing the magnetic dust filter
improved our CPU thermals from sixty two
thousand nine cells each delta T with
the dual intake configuration 250 1.8
Celsius delta T as a massive jump 11
Celsius and is one where we were able to
validate it repeatedly across multiple
test passes just because it really
didn't look believable until we dug into
it further for the stock configuration
with only one exhaust fan we saw a
change from 65.9 to 62.5 certainly an
improvement but given that there are no
intake fans to choke with that dust
filter the change is less significant
removing both the filter and the front
panel gives us our bear front
configuration which still sees a boost
but not enough of one
worth removing these somewhat required
front panel removing the optional dust
fill there's absolutely worthwhile
though as you can see in these results
TV thermals were improved similarly we
were throttling hard and most of these
test configurations as the throttle
point is eighty four C and we were at
fifty nine Celsius delta T that's the
choke point given that ambient is taken
out into delta T it wasn't until we
remove the magnetic dust filters and
added some fans that the GPU is able to
cool itself down in this torture
workload once we got rid of the front
filter it performs a spec and stayed the
low throttle territory so these are some
really strange decisions on general
takes part because they have a mesh
front intake which is not quite but kind
of a dust filter behind the mesh front
panel there's a dust filter attached to
the plastic panel you could pop that out
if you wanted to and clean it and then
behind that there's a magnetic dust
filter why do we need two maybe two and
a half filters depending on how you
define that front it's unnecessary and
it's restrictive to airflow where
obstructing the intake from what is
arguably one of the best most
differentiating features of this case so
that's kind of sad to see when we ask
that we'll take about this and validated
our testing results again multiple times
and really we're confident in them the
company noted that they'd rather include
extra dust filters that are removable as
it is harder for the end-user to source
an appropriately sized dust filter for
the case than to remove one that's
reasonable it certainly would be harder
for you to find the magnetic dust filter
perfectly to spec then for example to
just pull that one out but if you're
removing the filter anyway why include
it so here's where we are with this
we're about to go through the
comparative testing in a moment the case
does quite well if you account for that
change in the front that we were talking
about and the case overall is good it's
just its biggest problem is thermals
we've seen this before the difference
with this one is that you can solve it
so if you're interested in this case
don't sign it off complete or write it
off completely because of the thermal
issue keep in mind that you can pull the
front panel off remove the dust filter
and solve the problem for the most part
now should you have to do that apps
not and if that means that you buy a
different case so be it
hopefully thermaltake learns from that
and keeps that in mind for the future
the fan is also something that could
have helped a lot here if then we'll
take one with a better fan maybe spent
an extra dollar on the manufacturing
side and then moved it to the front of
the case and split the airflow between
the GP and the CB channels traditionally
that would be an improvement as well but
a single 120 millimeter fan that's not
particularly powerful in an exhaust
configuration of the top rear is not
going to help your GPU which is where
we're actually throttling and dropping
clocks and it's probably not going to do
a lot for the CPU either our comparative
testing starts with torture workloads
and then moves on to blender and 3dmark
for realistic workloads
well the torture load on the CPU and the
GPU the thermaltake cord g21
TG stock case performs about where the
be quiet pure base 600 did but a be
quiet case is the most noise suppressed
case we've tested so that's not really a
linear comparison we're between the
Shogun and speck oh for ultimately
adding two fans and removing the dust
filter really shows the potential
bringing us up to 51 hlz LT or on par
with a $180 corsair 570 ex case that
includes three front fans not bad for
the $70 unit though cost goes up about
fifteen dollars once we account for the
fans added we're also near the 270 ra
price competitive case that forgoes the
tempered glass and thermal takes open
air core p3 also is nearby the G 21 it
really has serious potential to be
competitive on the cooling front it's
just stifled by its stock configuration
looking at the GPU comparative
temperatures next the thermaltake core g
21 ends up slightly less bad than the
corsair spec of 4 and about on par with
fractals define CK's another warm case
on the bench when stock configuration
removing the dust filter and adding fans
doesn't help as much here bringing us
down to 50 6.9 so these TT but it's a
start these thermals could be brought
down further by manually configuring a
GV fan curve that's more aggressive and
slightly louder than these standard 55
percent speeds on our test GPU and most
GPUs follow that trend speaking of that
here's what noise levels look like we're
at about 30 5.5 DBA in the stock
configuration which shall be it warm
isn't too bad on the noise scale this
puts the case near the Corsair T 70 are
in fact
to find c with max rpms and an open-top
back to thermals on frequency for just a
few more charts CD blender workloads
give us a realistic scenario with no
load on the GPU here we're running a CPU
DT of 39.3 Celsius which sits the case
near the kale is 0 7 and well ahead of
the corsair spec up for $50 case a
blender GPU were loaded pins the GPU @
32.5 sells itself of T which isn't
throttling at least but it's also not
great at sitting between the kale 0-7
inspector 4 and lots of room to improve
your thermal take who really have an
advantage design with regard to the mesh
front finally looking at 3d mark we're
not hitting CPU issues at all with a 35
set 7 delta-t output though it's warmer
than the kala 7 by a good bit but Genie
temperatures are throttling once again
we can show a frequency plot now to
illustrate the clock decay over time as
the case permits temperature to warm up
to 82 C on the GPU resulting in
noticeable clock drops that would in
fact impact your FPS so that's the
problem with this case we have a few
dust filters we have this one here this
is a this is the one causing the
problems just to be clear it's a
magnetic thoughts filter it's got a
really fine grain to it so to speak and
although we've seen stuff like this in
the past on other cases certainly it's
not as critical of a position the front
intake and it's also typically not
accompanied by another dust filter you
can see this one is removable as well
and it's also fairly fine grain so what
happens is we're just really obstructing
the airflow and choking the fans in a
way that's unnecessary the dust
prevented from getting in the case
really is not going to be significantly
different and even if it's slightly
different you kind of get into territory
where it's like do you want a sacrifice
actual frame rate for dust when you have
a good filter already one of them you
just clean that because this is not just
a temperature thing it's frame rate you
lose frames by overheating the GP like
that and all this stuff is solvable by
the user so you can buy this case you
can do a few things it's good case if
you want to fix it what you do is first
you open the front like I just
it's trivial you pull from the bottom
remove this if you want you could
repurpose it and put it on top of
another case you can put it on top of
this one cut it map they didn't include
a dust filter for the top for some
reason but two and a half for the front
and once you've made that change the
next thing that would probably be
beneficial short of adding a fan in one
of these two slots is that you could
configure the video card fan to a custom
fan speed curve generally speaking a lot
of the video cards we test cap out at
about 55% because they do start favoring
noise over thermals you might want to
push that a bit to 65 or 70 percent when
it starts heating up and that will
prevent you from dropping frames or
clocks which results in dropping frames
and then further you could increase the
fan speed of your CPU cooler note that
where we're seeing high CPU temperatures
you might not it depends on the cooler
you select and how tall er until noise
you are this is one of the least
scientific types of testing we do
strictly because there are seven
different components and effectively
infinite combinations we can't pass for
them all in our test configuration we've
laid out the problems those we expect
will extend and be representative of
most configurations in a case of this
cost so keep all that in mind now not to
overplay the thermal issues that
Thermaltake has here the case itself
again is good the cable management is
good they do a great job of isolating
the front compartment FPC and the rear
compartment cabling and then the support
for radiators for extra fans the half
power supply shroud that gives you some
open-loop support if you wanted all that
stuff is really well thought out and
designed and actually speaking of the
tooling alone this is one of thermal
takes best cases they've designed
recently that's actually practical so
it's a shame to see the cooling issue
but at least you can fix it if you want
to and hopefully Thermaltake can - so
