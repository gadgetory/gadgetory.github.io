column B this week for hardwood news
it's about half intel half an D there is
a lot of stuff going on right now
especially with the quarterly reports
coming out so that typically means lots
of news items to discuss rumors as well
of course Sam Suns got some EUV based
seven animator chips that is an
actuality at this point not even a rumor
motor oil is working with iFixit
for right to repair phones it's actually
really interesting and good to see and
then ninth gen CPUs are already
difficult to find and often overpriced
before that this video is brought to you
by us and the limited edition foil graph
logo shirt this four color foil shirt is
the iconic GN graph logo with average
one percent and point one percent bar
colors it's printed on a soft
high-quality and custom made 100% cotton
shirt and is available on stored on
Karen's Nexus net until stock runs out
once it's gone we will not be making
more of these shirts we sold out within
two weeks of our previous
limited-edition shirts so click on the
link below to pre-order now the first
ones the most recent news item which is
the ninth gen as intel calls it or the
9000 series as we've been calling it the
9000 series cpu is following up on the
eighth generation coffee-like product as
a refresh are now very difficult to find
and we've had a lot of you recently
emailing us tweeting at us saying that
you've got pre-orders for the 99 hundred
k that haven't come in yet haven't been
fulfilled by Newegg or amazon and so
we're aware of that the SE p for the 99
hundred k is about four hundred eighty
eight dollars but that's for 1000 units
intel does their pricing by 1k you or 1k
unit SKUs and so the tray pricing as
it's called is 480 bucks for the 900 k
but the cpu is currently selling for 580
dollars at most us retailers which is a
larger markup than we typically see from
the 1k unit pricing it is also
subsequently out of stock which is
another problem so we've received your
emails we've looked into it a bit and a
lot of you are receiving zhi 390 boards
before even getting the cpus the
motherboard manufacturers are aware of
this and there's nothing that you can do
of course the i7 9700 K isn't very much
better here this one's at 410 - $420 it
is well over expectations for pricing
the 1k unit pricing on that one is about
374 bucks
us of course unsurprisingly it's mostly
out of stock as well and the i-5 the
9600 K is in the best shape so far
something like 280 dollars with a 1k
unit pricing of $262 so it's a bit
closer to reality and it's also actually
available at the time of writing on a
new egg at least so for the 1930 K at
580 dollars we have a hard time
recommending that CPU it's a great
performer it did well in our testing
it's good overclocker and it's an
interesting product but 580 dollars is
just too much for it it's it's way too
much
you're an h EDT price territory at that
point and it's just kind of a slow
migration of desktop into the HDD space
so the prices are up and availability is
low for everything but the i5 right now
this is also Intel related we'll just
group them all together there's a story
out semi accurate that has given
traction to a rumor that Intel abandoned
its 10 nanometer process claiming it was
for doomed to failure
Intel quickly refuted the idea via its
official Twitter accounts giving more
acknowledgment to the story than Intel
typically does to rumors stating the
following media reports published today
that Intel is ending work on the 10
nanometer process are untrue we are
making good progress on 10 nanometers
yields are improving consistent with the
timeline we shared during our last
earnings report now in the past so my
accurate has correctly forecast that
Intel would have issues with its 10
nanometer process what Intel stated
otherwise and at that time saying that
the media reports for issues with 10
nanometer were untrue and in that
instance it was semi accurate who is
fully accurate and Intel who would have
been semi accurate but this one whether
or not there's any truth to essays
newest report on the estimation of death
of 10 nanometer we're not sure right now
semi accurate has updated their story
though with Intel's statement and stated
that semi accurate stands behind its
initial reporting now
to an Intel speaking of 10 nanometre
could be overhauling its architecture
for 10 nanometre as it eventually comes
to fruition in theory for the
long-awaited 10 nanometer intel could be
preparing for their biggest
microarchitecture overhaul since 2015
skylake leaked benchmarks show higher
cache levels for Intel's ice lake with a
restructured cache hierarchy as well ice
lake is intended for the 10 nanometer +
node which should bring higher clocks an
IBC increase and in silicon mitigations
respector in Melton this is big spectrum
meltdown have impacted basically
everything in the CPU world for the last
couple months and the updates are now no
longer going to be confined to just
firmware and BIOS updates and microphone
updates they're actually in silicon
intel maintains that 10 nanometer yields
are improving in accordance with their
timeline getting Canon Lake CPUs in
systems by 2019
and ice Lake is on tap for about 2020
moving on to some AMD stuff now and this
starts with a couple of rumors but they
are well some of them are almost
certainly true at this point but rumors
have been swirling for some time about a
possible rx 590 from AMD and new leaks
suggest that both asus and power color
will have models ready at launch
what's more an entry in the 3d mark
database recently showed with drivers
naming the RX 590 series giving some
credence to the rumors and if the
information is to be believed the score
obtained was 5000 28 points in the 3d
mark test which would put any potential
rx 590 between about a gtx 770 a 1080 so
maybe in 1070 TI territory somewhere
around there under the current whatever
version it's in beta with drivers who
are that are potentially unfinished so
we're not sure if these are really
trustworthy numbers typically when the
rumors like this come out the fact that
the card exists is more reliable than
the numbers that are posted via leaked
cites for that card so we would probably
give give more leeway for the cards
existence than necessary for the score
but we'll see where it lands so the RX
590
would if this number is correct be a
1070 TI competitor it would be closer to
bacon 56 and performance than there are
580 of course but the cheaper memory on
a supposed rx 590 if it sticks with GDD
our memory could impact price in a way
that vega 56 just can't compete with
because it's stuck on HB m which is
really expensive to do it's about 150
bucks for 8 gigabytes of HP m depending
on when you check the price for HP m2 so
that price drop in memory could impact
the pricing positioning of the RX 590 in
significant ways which would be good for
AMD right now though rxpop 90 is
supposedly based on polaris 30 which is
a 12 nanometers refresh of players 20
and players 30 has recirculated the
rumor mill enough at this point that
it's almost certainly a Thane again just
it's the performance numbers were unsure
about so take those with a prescribed
grain of salt Vega 20 has also been
circling the rumor mill lately but this
is one where we would advise a heavier
dosage of salt where we are pretty
confident that Polaris 30 and the rx 590
are both a thin we are unsure of what
Vega 20s current positioning is this
would be an amount of salt prescribed
similar to what Linus takes when we
donate money to his stream for instance
so bigger 20 rumors perked up a bit
recently when a mysterious device entry
was found in a final fantasy 15
benchmark database and Final Fantasy 15
at least the benchmark is one of the
worst we've worked with so keep that in
mind as well it's really not optimized
at all and it had issues with hair works
calling another object : but anyway the
mysterious device ID is 6 6 AF C 1 feel
like I'm reading Powerball numbers right
now so that's the device ID we've
checked with our contacts on this one in
the industry and we've learned that Vega
20 likely won't arrive until early next
year at the soonest maybe nearing the
end of quarter 1 something like that but
this is more likely to be a different
component we're just we're not sure what
it is so if it is Vega 20 if that 6 6 AF
entry is Vega 20 and not something else
then realistically probably just discard
those numbers 1 it's the final fantasy
15 benchmark which is awful - if it's
Vegas money from
our contacts in the industry whom we
trust that's not really supposed to be a
thing not supposed to come out until
early next year so any current state of
both the hardware and the drivers would
be very early and that typically does
not produce the most accurate numbers so
keep that in mind we'd advise
disregarding the current performance
numbers assuming that's Vega 20 and not
something else until later this year or
early next year
next up Zen to could offer a 13% IBC
increase Italian publication bits and
chips has indicated that they believe
and these end to architecture will
completely overhaul and these core
design and bring about a double-digit
IBC increase to the tune of 13% there's
little data to actually go on here and
so we'll keep this short there's nothing
that suggests such an IPC increase would
affect anything but the higher compute
workloads and consumer chips based on
Zenzi are expected in 2019 they're
probably best to just wait for those
numbers depend a busy week for AMD we
had some Intel stories earlier but a and
these got a couple more here and these
are not rumors to draw that definitive
line so AMD landed Oracle as its latest
epic customer which is a good move for a
in the server department where it is
still out matched significantly by Intel
right now Intel holds over 90 percent
market share and server and the is
slowly gaining momentum in the
enterprise market AMD and oracle have
announced a partnership that will see
oracle deploy and the epic processors
and their bare metal virtual machines
available immediately in some parts of
the world oracle joins microsoft and
Baidu in adopting a and these epic CPUs
as part of their cloud business the AMD
epic based eseries will start with the e
2 with pricing at 3 cents per core hour
and configurable up to 64 cores oracle
and AMD will offer several instances
ranging from 16 to 64 dual socket
configurations and up to 512 gigabytes
of ram and the earnings are down
following the crypto crash and we're not
financial experts are not going to dig
into the financial side of this too much
just gives kind of the basics but we can
speak to GP demand and that is the
bigger impact or here so for this one
andy did post lower than expected
earnings for this quarter and andy's
revenue hit 1.65 billion
which is a 500 million it's 500 million
dollars short of the target of 1.7
billion dollars on the upside the
company's gross margin is up from 37
percent last quarter to 40 percent in
this quarter as for the demand aspect
and the increased GP production in
second quarter 2018 to meet demand and
then slowed production in third quarter
2018 all this was planned as AMD
predicted that there would be a crypto
fall of some kind and AMD predicted
accurately here so the problem though is
that a they might have been wrong and
just how many of its GPS were being used
for mining and these showed a 6% to high
single digits to 9 percent blockchain
revenue but that is it's really hard to
track where your cards are being used
blockchain or otherwise because if a lot
of people are buying from Amazon Newegg
or are maybe half gaming half mining but
they bought extra cards anyway that's
really difficult to track it might just
look like a gaming sale anyway so AMD
contract sales directly to mining
operations they can track sales of
things like maybe the dedicated mining
cards from some of the AIB partners but
once it's a gaming card it's really
difficult to know where it ends up and
for that reason it looks like AMD has
had a bit more of a fall in its revenue
for the client computing or in graphics
group then typically and just a note
here the trouble with them the earnings
that we've always had is the graphics
group and the CPU group are not
segmented they're not separated in any
way so you look at numbers for all of
them which makes it really difficult to
tell what's going on when one section is
doing well and the other might not be so
keep that in mind but the computing and
graphics segment revenue fell 100
million below the target fall of 50
millions they fell 150 million and that
put AMD at a bigger drop than expected
financial analysts seem mixed on this
report again we are not financial
reporters so not really qualified to
make our own judgments on what any of
this means it's a completely different
sector of the market so we'll leave it
for them but just to give you some
examples that are kind of at odds
seeking offseason opportunity in the
gross margin increase while Motley Fool
is
skeptical of performance and we're not
really sure of how either of those sites
typically behave so I will leave that to
you to figure out if you actually care
but let's move on to sort of technology
news something we can talk more about
Sam Suns the EUV based seven nanometer
chips look like they're finally arriving
and this is also not a rumor just to be
clear because there were a couple rumors
at the beginning there for some of our
news items so Samsung announced their
new LPP process based on the 7 nanometer
UV lithography and in doing so is the
first manufacturer to officially support
extreme ultraviolet lithography
something that we talked with David
Cantor about with regard to the 10
nanometer intel process you should
definitely check out that video if you
haven't according to Samsung wait for
production will begin for the Eevee
based seven LPP at the s3 fab which is
in Korea to Samsung's fab and these new
designs based on seven LPP will power 5g
applications the power automotive data
center IOT and artificial intelligence
applications just to name a few the
southern animator UV process brains
myriad benefits assuming Samsung pulls
it off Samsung promises a 40% area
efficiency 20% performance increase and
50% less power consumption compared to
its existing ten nanometer FinFET
process this next one is really
interesting personally because it's
about Motorola adopting some right to
repair movements in partnership with
iFixit and this is a big problem in the
industry we're in just in technology in
general where people are in a habit of
just throwing things away replacing them
within a year's time when they're
completely good so you talked about
people getting a phone and within a year
they toss it it's fine don't worry so
and and that's just it's not a good
habit to be in it's wasteful spending do
what you want with your money of course
we're not telling you not to do that but
when you're talk about digging rare
earth metals out of the ground and then
putting them in a device and throwing it
away in a year that's a problem and it's
not sustainable
so in supporting actual ability to
repair the devices so you can keep them
in operation motor all is doing some
good things hopefully this will catch on
a bit more but one of the biggest
problems right now is that manufacturers
not only make it extremely difficult
to repair their devices they go as far
as having US customs cease battery
replacements as what happened to Lewis
Rothman recently it would indicate so
it's becoming draconian and the only
real reason to prevent repairs of course
is so you can sell more new phones
because that's what makes money it's not
the repair that makes them any money
it's continuously cycling through a new
phone every year even when you don't
need to because the operating system
updates have slowed it down to points
which are unacceptable or the battery's
dying or you need to replace the
headphone jack because the connectors
are messed up or something like that so
yeah this is good news though motorola
is the first phone maker to openly
support writes repair and it's
collaborating with iFixit to offer DIY
kits for replacing batteries and
displays we've worked with iFixit in the
past we work with them with their protec
toolkit that's on the wall therefore
taking apart GPUs and stuff they make
good tools so this is a good partnership
for Motorola this is something of an
unprecedented move and one which is 180
degrees from the likes of other phone
makers like Apple that go out of their
way to limit out of house repairs and
even go through politicians to do so
so as devices get smaller and more
complicated to get more expensive
extending the life of electronics saves
you money and it saves a lot of that
material for things that are more
important or for making more phones for
a longer period if you want to look at
it that way a house with a severe a
waste problem that we have right now so
great on motorola and great on iFixit
for working on this and making it so
that people can actually prepare stuff I
mean Motorola can still make money
clearly by selling replacement parts so
there's still a market for them last one
here Ryan shroud who leaves PC
perspective so this is pretty big news
within the tech publication space Ryan
shroud is a long-standing journalist in
the PC space and technical tester so
Ryan just kind of from my perspective
here the originators before GN and
before our newest competition would have
been PC / tech report
and an attack and maybe Tom's hardware
as well at some point so those companies
have all changed in great ways of course
mr. shim P has left an attack he's been
gone for some time now Tom from Tom's
Hardware
has been gone from Tom's Hardware since
about 2007 sold it off and then Scott
Watson left a couple years ago maybe
2015 for AMD and now Ryan Shrout is
leaving for Intel and by the way Anand
Chimpy went to Apple if your honor where
he went and that we haven't really heard
much from him since so those are some
big players in the PC tech enthusiast
space and the reporting on PC hardware
space Ryan though has left for a
position of strategy at Intel and this
is after 19 years of running PC
perspective so Shrout also ran Shrout
research which is a firm dedicated to
market research and he is leaving both
positions at PC Pro and trot research
from what we understand from his post
completely so no further involvement at
least not financially from what he was
saying and not from any kind of
management perspective might stop by
every now and then say hi or something
but from what we understand that's about
the extent of it so he is leaving
completely from those roles Intel is
going to be hiring shrout as a chief
performance strategist following a trend
of these bigger companies hiring some of
the top names in tech reporting and
testing so Ryan good luck to you we've
worked with Ryan a lot over the years
primarily just running into each other
at events and Ryan's team has done good
work they've been running the ship
pretty much on their own for the for at
least a little while now so PC purse
should be fine in its transition similar
to the other sites Tom's I guess had a
bit of a downturn but that was more
recently after several editor-in-chief
changes but PC per should be fine in the
hands that it's in Allen Melvin Tana was
over there he does great SSD reporting
you should check out some of his reviews
if you haven't and Ryan best of luck to
you hopefully we see you at future
events and maybe you'll finally be the
person we bug about different questions
like hey when are we getting parts
windows embargo lifts where are the
drivers
no one else on your team is responding
you have to help us
Ryan best of luck and this will leave a
bit of a gap in the PC space so now I
mean it's you look at it Scott Watson is
out of PC reporting the founder of an
attack is out of report out of PC
reporting so you've got Scott is out
Ryan is out tom is out and on and
shrimpie is out so now we're where
you're left with me and for that I I'm
very sorry but thank you for watching as
always subscribe for more go to store
now k-mers exponet to pick up our graph
logo shirt and foil now and go to
patreon.com/scishow helps out directly
also I'll go ahead and link some of the
hardware sales we found for the week
below but SSDs are still massively
dropped in price from previously so
we'll link those thank you for watching
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
