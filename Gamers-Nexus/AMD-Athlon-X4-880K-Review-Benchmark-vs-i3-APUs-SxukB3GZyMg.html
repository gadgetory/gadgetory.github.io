cpu and like other Athlon cpus in the
past it is effectively an APU with the
IGP disabled that's the internal
graphics part of the die is actually off
so this is a bit different than the 70
at 70 K 7 8 9 TK in just one way and
that's the IGP but otherwise it's sort
of the same architecture same frequency
setup same core set up very similar
overall the main difference though for
you as a consumer is that if you don't
want that IGP you can look at the Athlon
series as an option and that reduces the
price to an MSRP of $95 with this x4 8
80 K versus 165 dollars for the 78 90 K
at a bit lower for the 78 70 K so that's
what we're looking at today is basically
does this thing work when paired with a
d GPU how does it compete with the APS
and how does it compete with Intel's i3
the athlon x4 a 80k uses am these
excavator architecture which is the last
line of Andy's old architectures until
Zen ships later this year the 880 K uses
the FM 2 Plus socket type and will
generally work best for overclocking
with the a 88x chipset motherboards as
with all case q CPUs from both AMD and
Intel right now the ATK has unlocked
clock rate multipliers and overclocking
abilities when coupled with a chipset
prepared for overclocking the ATK is
comparable to the AMD a10 7890 ka pu
which is a $165 chip and the athlon x4
ATK runs at 2 modules and 4 cores the
clock rate is 4.20 24.2 gigahertz
boosted and the a 10-7 890 K for
comparison runs a four point one to four
point three gigahertz clock rate so it's
100 megahertz faster and hosts 8 r7
compute units with 512 streaming
processors for graphics the 80k does not
have the graphics component and that's
the major difference and it's also a 95
watt TDP chip paired with AMD's 125 watt
near-silent cooler for comparison the
7890 K is the Wraiths cooler which we
reviewed previously in a full video our
last few APU reviews have basically
so that the a ATK is the chip to watch
out for and it's finally here
the reason we've been saying the lookout
for it is because the AP use although
they're powerful in their own right
maybe for a 300 dollar rig or something
similar it really doesn't make a lot of
sense as sort of a core game or to get
an APU even if you're on an ultra budget
because when you can spend sixty to
ninety dollars on something like this or
Intel's previously the G three to five
eight which we no longer recommend but
when you can buy something like that and
pair it with maybe even an 80 or 90
dollar GPU d GPU like a 250 X or 340 or
something like that the performance
difference is massive and it makes a lot
more sense as a gamer to go the route of
a cheaper dedicated CPU and a cheaper d
GPU than a more expensive single APU
unit which will generally underperform
for the types of games that our audience
tries to play even when looking at APU
performance versus lower-class chips
with a 250 X which is about as cheap as
you can get for a reasonable D GPU or
the 340 or 759 ti the 250 X it blows the
APS away and no competition in some
instances between the d GPU and the apu
set up some of these older charts that
you can see now show what you're looking
at from the 78 60 k review and that's
basically the raw power gain from even a
low-end d GPU liked the 250 X to the AP
use and these charts don't include the
80 K but we'll get to that momentarily
we tested the 80 K it for gaming
performance overclocking and thermals
and we're going to start with thermals
today the andy apu products are tough to
get an accurate reading from most of the
usual tools don't work or don't work
well and the per core readings are often
inaccurate depending on which software
you're using so that presents a
methodology challenge our current
thermal bench for the AMD cpus and the
AP use is limited but it's growing with
each review and the x-48 ATK with its
stock heatsink runs cooler than both the
7870 k and sony 860 K when each is
paired with their stock coolers it's a
surprisingly cool chip aided by the fact
that a large portion of the die which
would be the IGP components of the APU
is disabled from use
and these athlon x4 a 80 K uses what AMD
calls its 125 watt near silent
or ns cooler and that's the same as is
found stocked with the 78 70 K and 78 60
K the Wraiths is only found on the 78 9
DK which is new and some of the FX 83-70
chips for framerate testing we try to
provoke a CPU bottleneck by pairing
these lower end CPUs with a 980ti and
then we also pair them with a low-end
card like a 250 X and that's for
comparison against the AP use you can
see all the charts in the article linked
in the description below but we'll go
through a couple of them here provoking
a CPU bottleneck helps us understand the
total raw output potential of a CPU
without artificial limitations imposed
by other components for just the CPU
performance charts we'll start off with
Metro last light note that Metro last
light is uniquely picky about threads
and will present poor 0.1% low metrics
for just about every CPU shy of those
with eight available threads like the i7
hyper threaded CPUs at 1080p the athlon
x4 80k predictably performs equally to
the a-10 7870 k being a simplified
version of the $135 7870 ka pu there's a
clear CPU bottleneck established when we
look to the i-5 6600 K as a control
which pushes nearly 96 FPS average the
i3 6300 priced at $150 eats into the
performance a bit with a 14.5 percent
performance difference against the 6600
K and the athlon x4 8 80k suffers a 44%
performance difference when matched
against the i3 6300 though the Intel CPU
fairly is priced $50 higher it doesn't
make any sense really to opt for the IGP
options here the APS considering these
first tests couple of DGP with the cpus
and we can see that the AP use output
about equal cpu performance they're all
sort of tied with the X 480 K
substantially cheaper than the APU
options
there's no noteworthy gain over the
older 760 K in this particular benchmark
though that does change in a few other
tests shadow of mordor is one of those
the old x4 760 k performs at 74 FPS
average a 13 point 8 percent difference
from the new x4 8 80 K the AP is fall in
between these Athlon chips and the
70k again is effectively tied no reason
really to buy that if buying DGP you
because i mean just looking at these
benchmarks you pretty much see why you
wouldn't want the AP you it's all about
the same cv performance the AMD devices
are bottlenecking when compared to an i3
6300 again $150 and there's a 31.7%
difference between them but the AMD
devices are still exceeding 60 FPS at
1080p with the GPU we've chosen and our
reasonable gaming ships for their price
and again to be fair this is a worst
case scenario to 980ti
which realistically you would never pair
with an 80 k grid Autosport is one of
the most sensitive games we have when it
comes to cpu frequency and thread count
changes and without moving into the i7
range the most powerful CPU on this
bench pushes a hundred and thirty FPS
average in the form of the 6600 k the
6300 sees reduction of fifteen point
eight percent but it's still above the
100 FPS mark at 1080p and then we hit a
giant wall and the AMD chips start to
reach a fter the 60 FPS range the x4 760
case it's at 59 fps and is championed by
the 880 k with a nine point six percent
delta massive bottleneck overall but if
you're looking to get a sub $100 CPU and
a similarly priced d GPU maybe a 750ti
or r-73 7 maximally then the pairing
makes sense for the price as a whole
we've got a couple other charts for GTA
5 dirt rally and the witcher 3 all of
which will appear briefly on screen but
check the article in the description
below for more information on these
individually and to learn about what our
thoughts were on the results
next is overclocking the 80k isn't as
hot and overclocker as some of a.m.
these FX chips several of which can hit
the 5 gigahertz mark pretty easily but
it does boast room for overclocking
gains we were able to achieve a maximum
clock rate of 4.6 gigahertz on the ATK
prior to irresolvable instability and
the performance disparity is generally
minimal depending on game most games
show about a 5 to 10 percent performance
gain but on average sit around 7 percent
faster in terms of frame rate when
translating from the 4.6 gigahertz clock
rate not too impressive overall
certainly not impressive
compared against some of am these older
ships this isn't something I would
recommend buying if you really want to
get deep into overclocking and play
around with high clock rates but it is
still easy to work with you don't have
to make major voltage changes to get
that 4.6 gigahertz and it's worth
playing around with if you're curious
about overclocking at a top level but
don't want to really push the CPU until
it melts or dies don't expect enough
frames to increase your bottom line on
graphics settings with this overclocking
for the a 80k though so is the 80 K
worth it well it's in an interesting
spot in the market sort of above it is
the i3 range of Intel and Intel's got
that pretty on lock at the 130 to 150
dollar price point from the i3
standpoint they perform very well in
some games there's like a 40% gap
between this and the i3 that we tested
but that's a $50 price gap so you've
gotta weigh that and with that in mind
the place to look then is down so down
the skew line there's an Andy 860 K and
870 K and the 860 K is the one that
interests me the most because it's
priced at about $80 this is supposed to
be 95 ish but it's generally 100 105 on
Newegg and amazon right now and that
means that the 30 ish dollar gap 20 to
35 dollars between the 860 K and the 80
K is pretty significant if I were
building a machine that's sort of a
budget low spec gaming rig and I wanted
to devote as much money as possible to
the GPU what I would probably do is buy
an 860 K because you'll see fairly
similar performance to this especially
if you look at the 760 K that we
benchmarked now we didn't have an 860 K
for the bench to be fair but the 760 K
is a good indicator performance it falls
between there and here and I'm going to
be buying an 860 K out of pocket in the
future so that I can actually post a
review of that with the team but that's
that stated and out of the way the 860 K
makes better sense financially for a lot
of budget builds you can take that extra
$30 and buy a significantly bolstered
GPU you might be moving from a 750 Ti or
r7 370 card up to something that's more
like maybe a 959 60
maybe a 383 ATX something in there and
that's a pretty big gain and you will
actually get use out of that jump
the next thing to note the 880 K as it
stands the loan is pretty solid it's
it's something that you would buy
certainly instead of an APU if you're
trying to build a sort of quote-unquote
proper gaming rig with a D GPU in it
there's really no reason for you to buy
an APU if you're going to throw a video
card in there and this is where you
would go for the flagship end the top
end of that non APU spectrum from AMD in
the budget class that's where you would
certainly be falling still I would be
looking at the 860 K as my primary
budget class CPU and then after that I
guess this fits in the middle range
where if you've got enough to buy this
and a decent GPU but not enough to buy
an e i3 and a decent GPU you would buy
this but otherwise I would be either 860
K camp or sort of low-end I three camp
just depending on what I'm trying to do
with my rig so overall this performance
pretty well the thermals are reasonable
ash pretty good the game performance is
reasonable it's equal to the APS that
we've tested those are really generally
unexcited in terms of the gaps between
the AP US and this CPU they're all
really within one to three FPS of each
other and that's not exciting to talk
about but it does mean that they're
consistent and it does mean that there's
really no reason to buy those for in
some cases thirty sixty dollars more
than this thing this makes much better
sense for you as a DGP user but you know
30 bucks you get an ASIC CK still pretty
darn good there's a difference of a
couple hundred megahertz in the clock
rate that's really where you're paying
for the gains in this thing for the most
part so if you wanted something that's
similar to this what I would suggest 860
K overclock and a tiny bit if you feel
like you can do it and call it a day
that's a pretty darn good setup and you
do save a bit of money put it towards a
better GPU so that is the conclusion on
this overall not bad not as exciting as
I was hoping it would be when looking at
the AP use because
you know same architecture so had a bit
higher hopes but did not disappoint too
severely where we're condemning it it's
just right in the middle there between
an Andy product 860 K and an Intel
product i3 that's where I stand on it so
