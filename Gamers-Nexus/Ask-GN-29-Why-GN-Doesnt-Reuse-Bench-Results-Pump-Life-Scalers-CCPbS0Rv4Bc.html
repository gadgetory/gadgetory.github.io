episode this one not from the normal
studio we are still in California as of
this shooting but I don't know if this
will go out after we get home probably
will so we're in Southern California now
today visited MSI cyberpower NZXT will
be visiting EVGA and I would power
shortly couple companies for visiting
cloud imperium games of course but we're
not talking about that today today we're
doing ask GN so it's always comments in
the comment area below you have
questions leave your questions down
there I'll try and just the next time we
tried to shoot this in a nicer area than
the corner of the hotel room but the
spineless rent-a-cop security guard
didn't allow it so we're here first
question is from Terrence McCann who
says hey Steve when a graphics card is
outputting 1600 x 900 signal to a 1920 x
1080 monitor what handles the stretching
of the pixels so that it fits the whole
scale of the display the monitor is it
the monitor of the GPU also what is the
process called that is called the
scaling as I believe you even said in
your you answer your own question and
the question so it's called scaling and
the process itself there are two
components that handle it one is in the
monitor ones in the GPU and which one
gets used kind of depends on the
application or what you've configured in
Windows things like that so the the
component specifically is called a
scalar there are scalars and most
monitors not all and there are scalars
and GPUs if you have a laptop for
example notebooks often don't have a
scalar in the display Korean monitors a
lot of the Korean 1440p monitors that
are cheaper can it be cheaper by
eliminating things like the scalar and
so in those instances the laptop the
Korean monitors that are cheaper when
they don't have scalars they will rely
on the GPU to handle the scaling of the
the resolution so that's what that is
and that's how that works on Windows one
note here you can actually go through
control panel and force it toys use the
Jeep
you for some reason you preferred that
but it's not really not really that
important just kind of a side note in
case you needed to for some reason but
basically the scalar whether there is
one or not in a display is just a cost
thing and the GPUs will have one if your
monitor does not so that's all that's
all there is to that answer very easy
next question is from reps up who reps
up 100 I think he says as a actually
kind of big question is it true that GP
reviewers use already existing results
for newer benchmarks I came across this
from another site i was curious to know
if there's any truth to it and then goes
on to quote whatever the other site is
that says i'll be part of this i guess
they say what you have to realize is
that most big youtube channels keep
previous results say the benchmark
tarick's for ID and witcher 3 on day one
of our x 480 released three months down
the line they are testing a gtx 1060 and
they get that number and plugins they're
already existing results I can't speak
for other sites or other channels I can
speak for hours only and the way we do
it is pretty specific so first of all
every article that we published with the
reviews which they're often video
components for will have a test
methodology section that section will
define which drivers are used drivers
are huge and performance so we take this
into account I don't know what sites or
channels don't I can't it's honestly not
something i've looked into so it's i
just i don't know what other people do
but the way we do it is if i'm testing
say let's take the 10 80s we just did
all those liquid-cooled 1080s i knew i
was going to be testing at least three
1080s over the span of about a month and
i knew that there would be a driver
update in that month so the decision we
made was let's i don't know the exact
driver number off the top my head but it
is in the articles one of the seven to
two or five seven one of those drivers
but the decision we made was basically
let's take that newest driver at the
time for the first 1080 irie benched the
founders edition card so it was retested
we weren't taking results from May
because that's not a good thing
there's a couple factors to it let's go
through that first so first of all
taking old results often is okay for an
old game like metro last light shadow of
mordor things like that the reason you
see sites like ours and others often
using these games that are a few years
old in addition to in our case new games
like GTA 5 Mirror's Edge and doom is
because they provide some level of
stability so you can have these older
games often don't need to retest them I
will retest them at least once for every
test pass just to make sure nothing's
changed but the two factors that can
change our drivers and the game newer
games like doom doom is driving me crazy
because it pushes a lot of performance
changing patches every time one of those
comes out we retest all of the cards
that are on the bench and that's why
every now and then you'll see a purge
where we go from maybe 16 cards down to
something like four or five I try to do
a minimum of five so if you see that
that is because there's been a
performance change either in the driver
and it was a necessary driver or in the
game software and we can refuse the
patch with games like Assassin's Creed
syndicate which I've revived for vram
testing the test data for Assassin's
Creed syndicate doesn't really change
based on the game because even though
they haven't updated it recently we're
not testing on the newest patch testing
on an old one and that's because I'm
refusing the patch that we can continue
to use old data for cards that we no
longer have access to because that's
important in that use case so it really
depends specifically on what's being
tested as for the ten 80s I was talking
about so we I knew I was going to be
testing 310 80s i retested the founders
edition that's for still a lot of work
but we did not have to retest a lot of
other stuff and basically I picked the
newest driver at the time of the start
of the first car to reviewing which was
the Seahawk and then evj as hybrid came
out a new driver was out around the same
time we refused that driver because it
did not contain major game-changing
performance optimizations that we're
going to be relevant to our test but I
still didn't want to download a new
driver because now you're not a hundred
percent sure
it's in that driver package outside of
what they list even though what was
listed wasn't relevant to the test so we
take the older driver from the seahawk
test gigabyte extreme comes along
there's a driver update still hanging
there from the hybrid but not a new new
driver just the one account the hybrid
refuse that update we retest the or test
for the first time the gigabyte card
with the driver that was used for the
Seahawk hopefully you're following
basically carry the same driver through
a series of tests find a stopping point
which is the gigabyte extreme car that
we just reviewed because i know i'm not
looking at 10 ages for a little while
and we call it there the next time we
look at a 1080 depending on what's going
on how the driver landscape has changed
if there are specific game optimizing
changes at that point we'll decide if we
update retest the cards if we still have
them or if we just use the existing
drivers if nothing really has changed so
that's how we do it another factor of
this in order to keep some cards like
the GTX 1060 in the case of the 1080
review we just did in order to keep some
of those cards on the bench but still
produce content on a timely manner
sometimes we'll use for example in this
case the press driver for the 1060
before it was released was used I think
for the 1060 cards you find this in the
methodology and then the other driver
package is used for the 1080s it's all
defined in the article the 1060 wasn't
the focus and the patch did not contain
the driver update to not contain
optimizations that were relevant to our
testing so we're able to get away with
that but all that is very clearly
defined and any time we're testing is
the important part and it's how we're
testing one card specifically against
another all the 1080s all the ten 70s
although our X 480 is or if we're
looking at our x 40 verse 10 60 will
download the newest patch drivers
whatever for games for the drivers
themselves update and then test based on
that so I think that kind of explains
the way we do it I can't speak for the
other sites I can tell you that yes this
is something I have taken into account
since day one because I know there are
big performance changes potentially from
drivers and so that's that's all taken
into account
it is not always possible to use the
latest drivers and still see all the
cards on the bench in those cases if
there are not major critical game
optimizing changes then we'll use the
older drivers so that's the towel that
works next question is from Sergio
Eduardo Flores amenah who says wouldn't
integrated Ram drastically boost
performance on integrated GPS this is in
reference to last asked yen where we
talked about HP i'm on cpus in the
future on coprocessors or on whatever
the answer to that is yes because the
one of the biggest limiters of I GPS is
the system memory speed so that's why
you'll see it actually a legitimate
performance gain from something like a
2400 or 2133 agar instead of RAM which
is maybe 1600 if we're not going to
extremely low so the answer that's yes
it there's still a HP ms really freakin
fast so there's still kind of a cap to
where you start running into issues with
the limit of C use or whatever depending
on what I GPU are using die sizes of
limitation certainly so it's there is a
limit to basically diminishing returns
on something like that theoretically
it's not something that exists yet so
it's all theory but yeah it would
definitely increase performance on IDPs
because they're most heavily limited by
ram and then after that they're there
compute units or equivalent next
question Matt McGregor is actually last
question for today i'm at mcgregor says
love the in-depth QA videos can you
question can you damage an aio water
cooler 3-pin pump or four pin for that
matter running non pwm with voltage
control through basically external
software speed fan in the cases question
and then the next question was if no
damage is caused from voltage reduction
would it help prolong life of the pump
running at slower speeds most of the
time by reducing the voltage so i talked
some people about this who engineer or
at least work at the companies that
engineer the pumps to get a clearer
answer the answer is for the most part
the ideal pump voltage is 12 volts and i
guess you could lower it through
a hardware or software solution but from
what we've been told lowering the
voltage to make the pump run at a lower
speed won't necessarily prolong the pump
life because the pump is spect to
outlive basically everything else in the
system what will fail first or will
cause failure first is permeation of
liquid through the tubes and through the
system we talked to us before a lot of
these coolers are expect to live about
five years before they start losing too
much liquid to remain at peak efficiency
or they start failing the pump has a
fluid ceramic bearing in it and that
bearing is basically lubricated by the
liquid going through the pump so once
you start having permeation there's
issues there but the pump itself won't
fail just from running at 12 volts for
its lifespan is the answer to that
question I think in the most succinct
way possible so that is all for this ask
GN for more questions post them in the
comments below I'll get to them next
week or something hopefully we won't be
chased away by a golf cart enthusiast
looking out for the business parks
interests and its water fountain that we
thought looked like a good backdrop as
always patiently commercial video how is
that directly subscribe for more content
I'll see you all next time
