of ask GN as always leave your questions
in the comment section below for next
week's episode after this one we'll have
a separate extended ask GN for patreon
backers you can get access to it by
going to patreon.com/scishow and Rose
Nexus and speaking of this may be the
last video that we shoot without a shelf
behind me but we'll see how that goes if
you're not familiar with it that's also
on the patreon behind-the-scenes stuff
so a couple interesting questions for
this one we are looping back on the GPB
topic at least briefly I don't have a
ton of updates I have some stuff I can
talk about though before that this video
is brought to you by Thermaltake and the
view 71 enclosure the view 71 is a full
tower case that's capable of fitting
three video cards and most
configurations it's also one of the
better cooling cases in our recent case
testing bench lineup the view 71 has
hinged a tempered glass doors on either
side that make it easy to open and show
off and it comes with at least one rain
fan though you can get the RGB version
if you prefer learn more at the link in
the description below this first
question is something we brought up in a
news video briefly and we'll talk about
again now this comes from John rty
double-oh-seven who says hey Steve do
you have any opinions on the articles
released by hard OCP pc / and forbes etc
on the nvidia geforce partner program it
seems like an interesting topic and
could greatly affect the consumer market
as a whole I have a whole separate sheet
on this one we don't often prepare
entire extra sheets for this because
this required some research so let's try
and get into this this is a very
difficult topic to talk about and it's
primarily because there's really two
sources of information there's Nvidia's
blog and there is hard OCPs original
article those are our primary source of
information we went out and tried to
speak with board partners s eyes
analysts anyone we could find who would
well who would say anything or not say
anything because both are really equally
useful right now and we talked about
this in the news video where at the time
we had no additional information from
our contacts we were not able to get any
information that validated or
invalidated the story people generally
I didn't know or wouldn't talk about it
and sometimes it's hard to distinguish
between the two I've spent the last week
talking to a few more people so here's
what we're gonna do first of all in
complete effort of fairness and for
benefit of the doubt and because there's
really only one source of information I
did reach out to NVIDIA I did offer them
the opportunity to talk with me either
directly about the hard OCP story which
reasonably they did not want to comment
on or talk about the GPP in general thus
far we have not received a response to
our inquiries so I would like NVIDIA to
consider speaking with us in more detail
about I want to say their stance on this
but I don't even need their stance on
the discussion of GPP as it's been
presented currently I want their stance
on GPP as a program and how does it
benefit their partners and the consumers
that's what I would like to talk with
them about right now but I don't have
that today we did want to present that
opportunity to them no-count presently
so what I do have is a list of people as
percentages with whom I've spoken about
the program or well we know it exists
but we don't know to what extent the
hard OCP story is accurate right now the
only person who really knows that really
is Nvidia and to some extent Kyle as
Kyle from heart OCP notes that he has
some sort of documentation which is not
public so let's go through the numbers I
have this can be very brief and very
direct 35% of the people we spoke with
genuinely had no idea the legitimacy of
the heart ocv claims or the illegitimate
II the the kind of answer I got was that
this is all discussed way above their
pay grade and this is part of the
problem this is why it's hard for me to
dig into this like a lot of people want
because our contacts are often marketing
PR maybe some technical marketing and
very limited engineering resources none
of those people
would be involved in these discussions
for the most part now some of them may
have overheard things or may speak with
their higher-ups so that would be kind
of the only angle you have and that's
still second-hand information which is
why it's very difficult to talk about
this story because I can give Nvidia a
chance to talk I can give board partners
a chance to talk if no one talks to me I
have nothing to add so that's the
challenge right now let's go through the
rest of them so 35% genuinely no idea
and I believe them what was going on how
accurate the story is or how inaccurate
it is is discussed above their pay grade
15 percent unsure and 15 percent more
think that this is a non-story and an
AMD PR opportunity which is referencing
the the fact that it was an AMD sort of
vended story 20 percent board partners
would not comment at all specifically
told me they would not comment and
typically these are people who do talk
to me even if it's off record this time
however they would not do so 15 percent
more were upset at the terms of the GPP
and indicated arm-twisting by nvidia and
and then nvidia would not comment so
what we've got here is basically a whole
huge percentage of no information no
comment
I don't know and then we have is it
equal percentages here equal percentages
equal counts of people who have told me
that they their team was upset at the
terms of GPP or who have told me that
they think this is an AMD PR opportunity
so basically once you rule out all the
people who said I don't know I won't
talk to you or some variant of those
things you know that's with 50% of
people who answered me saying we don't
like gvv and 50% who said this seems
like a non-issue or it seems like an AMD
PR op I don't know where to go with that
information so I've been trying guys
I've been
to talk to more people it's very
difficult to get anything here and that
doesn't necessarily indicate that Nvidia
is doing something wrong it does
definitely indicate that my contacts
aren't high enough up the chain to give
me a proper answer like we all want I'm
not saying that Nvidia is definitely in
the clear I'm not saying that they are
in the wrong I'm saying that we have no
meaningful way to make a determination
at this point and it's not my story
Kyle's apparently got the documents and
we don't so that's that's really pretty
much as far as I can go with it
now saying all of that let's briefly
talk about two things here one of them
is why would and Vidia create this
program and think that it's good so
we're going to take their position for
that the other one is why would people
or partners see this program as bad so
that's the opposite side I'm gonna
present both of those to my present
understanding and then we'll move on
until I get more information let's start
with Nvidia's I gave Nvidia the
opportunity to talk to me about it
we were pointed to the blog post I read
the blog post and it more or less
outlines why they think this is a good
thing if you haven't read it in effort
of trying to read every one side it is
worth reading so my interpretation of
the blog post and of Kyle's information
that he's posted assuming accuracy of
both of those we're assuming Nvidia's
not lying and their blog post we're
assuming Kyle's not lying in his post
so taking both of those two only sources
of information I have my interpretation
is that Nvidia in an honest effort is
trying to preserve their marketing
dollars that they give to vendors I want
to list a bunch of companies but I also
don't let's just say EVGA cuz they only
make Nvidia so we're not going to hurt
any feelings so so let's say EVGA Nvidia
wants to take their money that they give
EVGA and their marketing Development
Fund and they want that money to be used
to advance an Nvidia product under a
known presumably EVGA brand and that's
so that if EVGA also sells AMD products
which I guess EVGA rearranges
conveniently
eega so EVGA has got a vga product and
nvidia wants to make sure that the EVGA
v EGA is not sold under the same
branding as the EVGA nvidia product they
don't want a let's call it an FTW that
is for both if they are providing money
to advance that FTW product line I think
that's that's the gist of the primary
argument that Kyle has posted and and
that would be how I would interpret it
if giving the benefit of the doubt to
Nvidia so from that interpretation I
would say it's reasonable to not want
your marketing money spent on a brand
which carries a competitor's product I
get that however there are also concerns
so some of those might be as presented
by Kyle some of them would be AMD being
sort of backed out because this comes
down to whether we're talking about
established brands or not this is a big
question I had friend Vidya but let's
talk about that let's go down this path
right now
so with Nvidia's agreement if they are
saying to vendors you have to create an
nvidia brand or or establish an existing
brand as in video only in order to
receive these benefits because we don't
want to give you money to develop
something that you are also selling with
your competitors products so then the
question is let's say there's a company
that makes a a brand called dog the
democracy of gamers the company that
makes dog do they have to take that
established well-respected democracy of
gamers brand and for lack of a real word
exclusive eyes it under Nvidia products
or can they say you know what Nvidia we
like this GBP idea however we spend a
lot of time developing the dog brand and
we would like to be able to sell both
AMD and NVIDIA under that brand how
about this what if we create a dog aires
brand that is only nvidia products so
that's my question is that okay
or or does the entire dog brand have to
be Nvidia or can the company say dog is
going to be vendor agnostic and we're
gonna create a new one to get me
benefits of GPP and it's not gonna sell
I am the product so is it then ok for
the vendor to produce a new brand that
is exclusive 10 video or does it have to
be an established one these are all the
questions I have absolutely no answers
to them so the reason I'm saying all
this is because there's a lot we're
trying to consider here to give everyone
a fair shake but no one's talking to me
so and that's not necessarily because
they don't want to it's not necessarily
because they're trying to hide something
but as I've stated a lot of them
genuinely know nothing PR people would
never be clued in to this kind of
discussion in general or the half that
spoke to me don't like it the half the
other half think it's a non-issue
you can see why I'm kind of exasperated
at this whole topic because I have
nowhere to go with it well look into it
further I'll let you know if there are
updates my final word on it is I would
absolutely be concerned if this program
exists in the fashion which it has been
presented thus far by heart OCP and I
would very much like Nvidia to provide
more of the transparency that they have
promised by just talking to us or other
media about just the upsides what are
what are you trying to do with this
program not any gotcha questions not
trying to corner anyone I just I just
want something it's something to go out
so yeah that's that's where it is that's
where we'll leave it a second question
might as well just make that its own
video second question is from strand
Easter who said hi Steve did
Coolermaster respond to you in any way
after you release your CMH 500p mesh
review and no no they did not
: I stir didn't say a word to us that
was easy next question as rock by the
way that case was if I didn't make it
clear was actually good I liked what
they did with it but uh we didn't praise
the first one so
screw us I guess next question asrock
unpredictable reference card Steve with
the current memory crisis will using HBM
type memory become an alternative
solution
not really and the very easy answer to
it is because the same people who make G
DDR and DRAM which has problems in terms
of availability and price they are the
same people who make HB m so HB m is
primarily samsung right now and microns
been getting into it so you have the
same vendors they run on the same out of
the same fab so you can have the same
problems HP M is also very expensive
anyway a couple times more expensive
than gddr5 for example so because of
that let's even if you pretend hbm's not
going up in price other types of memory
are still cheaper and HP I'm also
requires significant redesigns of
architecture to integrate so no no it
wouldn't help it wouldn't help
unfortunately next question is from Rama
Kiara a week ago he said HBM is stupid
1080 beats Vega without HBM so AMD you
had no visible using HBM and making the
card more expensive we actually have a
great video on this it's I think you can
just search for HP m verse gddr5 on the
channel or how much does HBM cost where
we talk about why AMD chose HP m so it
definitely makes the card more expensive
you are correct
I disagree with the simple answer that
HB m is stupid
HP m and video uses it too there are
good reasons to use HP m they use it in
their volta products right now so an AMD
use it in some of their high-end
products HBM has significantly lower
power consumption than g ddr memory
which is very important because you have
a power budget for those cards and it
also has advantages in bandwidth and in
architectures that can leverage the
bandwidth like the Volta products it's
definitely not stupid because in those
instances using
gddr5 would limit you for AMD their
products there although they were
somewhat backed into a corner with their
choices when developing things like Fiji
and it did not pan out well betting on
HBM didn't necessarily work for them
in spite of all that they also sort of
had to use it because these products
became so power hungry that AMD had
really no option we talked about it in
the GDR 5 versus HP m2 video basically
the extra couple of watts here and there
for every piece of gddr5 memory on the
card will push the power budget to
ranges that are unreasonable also AMD
gains a lot from HP am i overclocking
they are bandwidth bound in some cases
for their memory and that neccessity
it's a higher bandwidth memory choice so
no HP M is not stupid it does make the
card more expensive I'll give you that
and it does need to be used in obviously
scenarios that make sense Warren said we
all know it's bad idea to run a CPU with
no thermal paste between it and the
heatsink but how dangerous is it really
doesn't the CPU forcefully turn itself
off to prevent damage anyway if it gets
too hot yes
so if you kind of it'll thermal shutdown
in theory if you're your t.j.maxx sent
when when your motherboard senses
t.j.maxx depend on what you've
configured or what's configured by
default you'll either shut down the
system or throttle in either case it's
protecting your CPU from further harm as
long as you can identify that the issue
is thermals and a thermal shutdown and
you fix it before before routinely
running into that scenario you'll be
fine and even if you run into it a few
times it's probably still fine because
things like passengers take some damage
they aged faster at 105 degrees Celsius
for example but you're still talking
against thousands of hours as long as
t.j.maxx is tripping a shutdown or a
hard throttle that lowers temperature
reasonably then you'll be ok and if it
doesn't then there's a problem
definitely if you're if you're forcing
it to run against t.j.maxx without any
kind of
protection yes there's a problem Sean
Lyons says how important is the hot spot
temperature on GPUs as reported by
monitoring software such as hardware
info for example on my Vegas 64 liquid
edition the GPU hot spot temperature
will max at 105 average 57 during fire
strike and the GPU thermal diode only
hits 49 I don't know if it's been
answered since Sun last time we looked
at Vega
there was no concrete answer on where
the hot spot temperature is however I
did sort of pick up a a an idea for
where the hot spot temperature is and
that seems to be between the HBM and the
GPU so I came up with this basically by
testing one of those I think was the
power color card with very poor thermal
contact on the HBM and the temperature
was significantly higher for the GPU hot
spot which indicated to me that it was
not in the middle of the GPU diet dye
because that had full contact to the
cooler and the HBM did not have any
contact at all in this test to the
cooler so my assumption was that the hot
spot is somewhere between like the dye
and the two hpm dyes somewhere
triangulated in there that's that was my
guess maybe someone's answered it
concretely by now sike says why don't
laptop manufacturers like Apple and
Microsoft use liquid metal their
products shouldn't be a problem if
applied properly and would help
massively with cooling as a customer you
can't open their laptops anyway so
there's no danger of someone doing
something that's stupid with lucre metal
later there's always danger of someone
doing something stupid and you can still
open the products liquid metal should
not be used in that type of thing for a
number of reasons one of them being that
of its direct eye contact as opposed to
an IHS which is off in the case you run
into potential corrosion or pitting
issues you run into issues of not tight
enough app installation of the cooler
where you could have liquid metal
spillage over the sides shorting things
and killing them parts tend to loosen a
bit with age laptops move around a lot
they go through a lot of shock and
vibration it's possible that things lose
now for some liquid metal gets out short
something you'd be better off soldering
if you wanted to improve your thermals
that much but yeah there's there's a lot
of good reasons to not do it
Zeta our CLC is becoming common enough
for you to include them and your thermal
case testing alongside the air cooler
the problem here is dismounting that
we've done some of this as one-off
testing it's best to do it as one-off
testing because then we can test the
concept demonstrate how the CLC performs
against the air cooler under different
conditions generally with different
mounting orientations and locations but
the problem is if we're standardizing
our case test bench introducing a lot of
mounts and dismounts of the cooler
starts to cause concern for long-term
use and for consistency of testing
especially for all that different
thermal paste application so that would
be our main concern
I'd do it as one-off couger how do you
clean an anti-static mat say for
instance the GN anti-static mat or
another popular brand the one I
currently have such as mod rights mod
mat I believe they composed of the same
materials or maybe they don't you could
explain this as well they actually don't
they're very different what is the best
way to clean them thanks okay so here is
one of the mod right mats and we did
competitive analysis as we ramped into
producing our own I'm biased uh we make
the other mod mat but I do obviously
think that our material is superior we
did have the advantage of getting to
look at all the others and figure out
how to make a superior material for ours
so this one is more of a you can see
it's like a rubber ours is is rubber
it's rubberized but this is like more
like a tire rubber so it does have a
different like feel to it leave some at
least this one leaves some residue on my
hands when I interact with it but
cleaning them is about the same
so for cleaning you could if you're
gonna be like hyper-paranoid and you
want to do it like a cleanroom wood
which is not necessary at all we just
this is just
ESD service and mat cleaner it's called
that comes with our industrial stuff we
buy for business great testing and it's
it's what is it even composed of it's
just a cleaner it's really trivial you
could honestly you could use rubbing
alcohol to clean hours but you spray it
on and then you take like a rag but
paper towels we find don't really work
great for this for theirs or for hours
because the paper towel will kind of
disintegrate as you're cleaning it
because the surface is a bit gritty and
for good reason it's so that things
don't move around and because the Matt
weave is I mean it's just great here by
Nature but it's just he's a normal drag
so that answers your question how to
clean it the material though I did want
to point out just cuz you said you think
the material is the same it's it's way
different ours is it it's it's a
rubberized surface and underside and
it's made in a factory that makes
products for clean rooms and this one is
more of a pure rubber so in terms of how
it feels it's a lot of different in
terms of how the ink applies to them
both it's a lot different
I'm not saying either is better or worse
in terms of the ink application I'm just
saying materials react and respond a lot
differently to the processes we put them
through so yeah that's that answers your
question I think anyway clearly biased
on that but I'm also not afraid to say
that I'm confident
ours is a lot better next question over
the last one I think you should really
diversify from random tech tips really
diversify the Gion portfolio into hair
products I think you'd be successful
well let me announce our new gamers
Nexus anti-static hairspray you can pick
it up on the store and we will sell used
versions if you want them for actually
more because I touched it and so the
value went up so that's it for this one
