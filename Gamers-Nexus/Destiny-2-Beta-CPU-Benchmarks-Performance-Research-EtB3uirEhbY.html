companion to our GPU benchmark for
destiny - hoping that we'd have a full
suite of CPU benchmarks to definitively
and confidently state which cpus are
better in the current beta state of
destiny - what it turned into was more
of a research piece we looked into
performance across different settings we
attempted to optimize those settings on
the CPU side and looked into multiplayer
its campaign performance a lot of the
stuff we do is the GPU benchmark except
applied to CPUs as well and there's a
good reason for that which we'll talk
about through this video before that we
partnered with LastPass to bring you
this video LastPass is a password
manager that helps generate random
passwords for each account and sharing
unique passwords for every log in as
fast strengthens account security so
that you're no longer using the same
password for multiple sites learn more
at the link below so let's go through a
quick recap of the GPU benchmark first
of all in the GPU testing we found a few
important things one of them is that
depth of field destroys performance
particularly frame times with AMD
Hardware when it's at its highest
settings as in using the highest preset
so specifically to address that what we
would suggest is that if you're looking
at playing this game consider using if
you can support the highest preset and
then go manually drop down depth of
field to something lower ambient
occlusion also had somewhat of an impact
all of that and the GP benchmark won't
rehash it all here but if you want to
learn more about the GPU side of things
that check that content it's also got
all of the research that went into the
initial part of this one now because
this is a beta that has a limited time
before it expires we were basically
researching stuff encountering issues
trying to figure them out while we were
going which means there's no room to
really adjust the core benchmarks
on-the-fly so what we have for you is a
more detailed look at how the CPUs
perform under different parameters
within the game and we do have
comparative benchmarks between CPUs but
they're not the core focus of this
content because thanks to a few
decisions that the destiny's team has
made our confidence in some of the
numbers are a bit lower than we'd like
one of which is a limitation on SMT and
these SMT is effectively unwell
not even effectively it's just plain
unutilized in destiny - right now from
what we've seen and we can ultimately
only speak to what we've seen so there's
room for things to be different it is a
beta keep that in mind stuff can change
drivers are game ready for the Nvidia
card that we use for the CPU benchmarks
they should be fine but can still change
so there's room for differences in other
benchmarks and what other people do and
test and things like that but we did not
see any functional gain from SMT being
enabled which means that a lot of the
rise in CP is just lose that advantage
that they have on the thread side so
some some decisions here that we didn't
like fraps being broken is another one
so not just fraps but on screen displays
fraps I believe afterburner and
rivatuner and a couple of other
solutions broke today the day of filming
this and they worked the previous day
during the private data
so basically Bungie won and they're
disabled them from what we understand
and it sounds like that's for some kind
of anti cheat or anti hack purpose
hopefully by the time the game ships
they have a better solution than just
breaking everything that people use for
every other game in the PC world
especially since Bungie is trying to
come out of the swing and saying hey PC
players look at what we're doing for you
relatively uncapped frame rate etc also
don't use any software or else so I'd
like to see that change but I will see
if it does with the October launch
either way all of our tools worked the
first day of the beta and then we had to
switch to other tools to the second day
that still worked but those might get
phased out as well once Bungie discovers
them so let's get into this starting
with the CPU side of things it's all CPU
side is supposed today what we're
looking at is the thread limitations and
then going into multiplayer and campaign
differences so straight away we noticed
that thread utilization was a mixed bag
destiny punishes rise in CPUs by
ignoring SMT we didn't have time to test
it but if you disabled SMT Mike and
uplift like we saw in other games at
launch of Rison and so this was ignored
to the point I've seen a zero percent
utilization more or less on the SMT
threat horizon 7 said
900 with all physical cores engaged did
not report any of its additional threads
engaged so you're looking at eight cores
utilization and eight untouched this
remained a theme for the 1600 x as well
where the logical threads did not engage
with the game the good news is that
we've seen this before
total war Warhammer in battlefield 1
both pushed updates post Rison that
improves performance on Intel and AMD
alike this was primarily by better
utilizing the SMT threads and again it
benefited both companies
so we're unclear on if this will happen
for destiny 2 at some point but for now
we're off to a rough start and that's
more on bungees end than anything so
hopefully Andy can work with bundi to
try and fix this going forward but for
now the game is reasonably optimized on
GPUs to the point where it actually
performs decently once you eliminate
depth of field issues and it's lacking
heavily on the CPU front so kind of
disappointed see that let's look at
performance scaling and competitive
multiplayer versus the intro campaign
effectively single-player as a reminder
this was tested for our GPU benchmark as
well and we found that scaling was
highly consistent on our 7700 K 1080i
1050 Ti and rx 580 will cycle through
some of those tests on the screen now
but the full recap is in the bench video
for the GPUs ultimately standard
deviation was far greater in multiplayer
and the average performance tended to be
within a couple percentage points of
campaign generally about a 6 percent
difference performance between
multiplayer in the campaign but with far
greater consistency and tighter standard
deviation in the campaign tests which
ultimately made it more desirable as you
can see with the Saudi 700k numbers what
was the campaign tests were within
bounds of the more variable competitive
testing on Midtown this makes campaign a
good stand-in that's representative of
multiplayer during our GPU benchmarks
but again more on that in the GP video
so let's look at the table of our three
1200 runs on the Midtown multiplayer map
using 1080p highest settings across
multiple competitive matches we're
averaging 85 FPS with lows at 59 4 1%
and 44 0.1%
the range is 79 fps 290 FPS for this
test sequence with standard deviation at
about 5 FPS for the averages bringing
the campaign results on the screen now
the share space the r3 1200 still at
1080p highest is
standard deviation tighten to 0.8 FPS
average the final bench score is 94 FPS
average 60fps 1% lows and 50 to 0.1%
lows
this makes the campaign bench seen score
approximately 9 FPS higher in averages
and markedly higher in 0.1% low frame
time consistency we've got a bigger
spread here than with GPU testing
unfortunately and it seems to deal with
how the lower end CPU is are engaged
during multiplayer the gap is about 9%
between campaign and multiplayer with an
r3 and that gives us a starting point
for understanding performance throughout
the game moving to 1080p hi our
competitive matches at now range from 80
to 295 FPS averaging out to 87 FPS
average 55 FPS 1% lows and 40 fps 0.1%
lows
compared to the previous multiplayer
logs with 1080p and highest settings
we've now got a delta of plus or minus 2
FPS average which is effectively equal
this is a trend we've run into with the
low end CPUs and comparative testing as
parts bump into a wall that isn't
remedied by going from highest to high
bringing the campaign table up we see
the final bench scene score of 93 FPS
average is 1% low is 60 10.1% low is at
52 compared to multiplayers final bench
averages that we're about 6 FPS higher
an average framerate and 13 fps higher
and zo behind present low frame time
converted fps values although we saw a
much smaller difference on the 7700 K so
the lower and our three CPU is more
susceptible to frame time variance and
multiplayer than in the campaign at
least as far as our testing goes today
here's a frame time plot showing the r3
1200 performance at 1080p high when an a
multiplayer match matched against the
same CPU and settings in campaign mode
frame time variance is reflected visibly
if we make another frame time plot for
the 7700 K in campaign vs. multiplayer
using the settings detailed on the chart
header it's clear that the performance
impact is last significant there's a lot
more to know but we won't have enough
time prior to the betas end to figure it
all out most of that will wait until
October anyway for now we're seeing
bigger swings and performance on the r3
versus the i7 CPU will have to
reevaluate testing options for CPUs and
destiny too once the game properly
launches but right now the variance is
greater than what we see with GPU
testing which makes test core
and planning more difficult to figure
out the best we can do for now is
demonstrate those differences help
viewers understand where the game's
performance may change depending on
which part of the game you're playing
and then commit to some type of tasking
that's consistent so we had already
committed to testing for the campaign
for this one because we started that
with the GPUs found it was extremely
reliable and very comparable in terms of
performance with the multiplayer
gameplay and so we stuck with that just
keep in mind going through this that the
lower end hardware like the r3 is the G
45 60 things like that will experience
bigger frame time variants in
multiplayer than what we're going to be
showing with the campaign results once
we get to the competitive or comparative
data so there will be a dip there if you
go into multiplayer it's still
relatively comparable we're within nine
ish percent average frame rates so we're
in the ballpark for now this is the best
we can do once the game ships will
reevaluate invest more time into
figuring out how we can do things better
to fit with Bungie and destiny to is a
very strange at times requirements for
the game in terms of how it behaves with
different hardware so we'll look at that
then but there's clearly only a few days
right now so this is what we've got it's
pretty good it's not the best but the
point is you have all this data to look
at the multiplayer the campaign
performance and the performance of
different graphics settings that we're
going to get into so normally this isn't
stuff that's really shared as part of a
benchmark benchmarks tend to be CPU a
for CPU B which one's better what we're
trying to do is say here are all of the
parameters and situations that you need
to look into because the game obviously
has different a bunch of different game
modes and then consider all of those
things once we go into the core
benchmarks that are going to be
representative primarily of campaign
play our next topic is the impact of
graphics settings specifically on the r3
1200 hopefully enabling us to better
understand performance differences and
where there's Headroom for improvement
our first attempt at improving framerate
went something like what's on the screen
now there's almost no change and the
campaign areas we tested these
minimal impact most the impact seems to
go to either the GPU or just isn't
visible at all in current accessible
areas of the game so there's room for
this to change later once more zones are
released either way going from highest
settings to lowest settings produce no
measurable difference in performance and
a huge difference in visual quality we
next attempted this in multiplayer
despite greater variance tested test and
found that the highest settings and
multiplayer match has produced the
numbers on the left and that the minimum
settings produced the output on the
right of the screen we're showing each
test pass rather than just a chart with
them averaged because there's more
variance in each execution so we'd like
for viewers to understand what the
variance looks like when you test in
multiplayer rather than just averaging
them all together and muddy in the
waters our difference ended up being 85
FPS average and 40 fps 0.1% lowest for
highest with minimum settings being 95
FPS average and about 40 fps 0.1% lows
again that's minimum that's disabling
stuff down below even the lowest preset
just to try and figure out what kind of
changes we'd see on the CPU side the
game looks awful at this point
comparatively and we can show some that
in b-roll but all these changes not only
about a nine to ten percent performance
uplift now of course this is just one
CPU if you count the 7700 K from our GPU
test that's kind of two CPUs so we can't
definitively speak for all the CPUs but
as far as these go there's more room for
GPU scaling than CPU scallion in our
testing for destiny to beta so all that
in mind let's get into the comparative
benchmarks again a big reminder that
this stuff is subject to change the game
is beta the performance is sort of
inadequate in some ways in terms of
thread utilization and tapping into the
CPUs so there's a lot that can change
here don't read too far into it for now
but this will give you a baseline for
where the beta sits starting
comparatively with 1080p and highest
settings the intel i7 7700 k-chart tops
at 171 FPS average which is bumping
against the 200 FPS frame cap that's
enabled by default this means that frame
time latency is faster than 5
milliseconds will be capped to 5
milliseconds and so will drag down the
average below what could be possible the
next CPU in line is the i-5 7600 case
the Ox CPU performing
157 FPS average 104 1% lows and 8701 %
lows
this is trailed by the i3 1750 K at 131
FPS average with lows at 88 1% and 79
0.1% our overclocked r7 1700 effectively
a stand-in for the 1700 X and 1800 X as
well and so they can all achieve similar
clocks performs at 126 FPS average at
3.9 gigahertz this plants the 3.9
gigahertz r7 CPU if you have PS behind
the i3 and part of this performance
deficit is due to destiny T's failure to
acknowledge all the threads so we've
only got physical cores engaging
properly that's obviously a huge part of
horizons argument is having all of those
threads you know that this isn't the
performance people want to see out of an
r7 remember that destiny 2 is one in
beta and to having trouble with SMT so
issues arise we may see a performance
gain that later on just like we did with
Total War but it's hard to say right now
so for now this is what we're seeing in
our testing but because of destiny T's
present state our confidence isn't
strong enough right now to claim with
authority that these results are
representative of all configurations and
scenarios as the game is still
developing and clearly has issues down
the line the r5 1600 X performs about
2.7 percent behind the overclocked r7
1700 keep in mind that as far as Bungie
is concerned the 1600 X is a 6 thread
CPU and the 1700 is an 8 threads GPU
so the actual advantages of the 1700 are
not reflected here beyond an additional
2 threads as far as the game is
concerned we're looking at a 200
megahertz clock difference that
manifests in a 2.7 percent boost over
the other CPU both the 1600 X and stock
1700 boost to 3.7 making them
effectively equal and planting the two
with invariance of one another
Intel's G 45 60 meanwhile performers at
110 FPS average with low at 73 and 65
frame times so far are reasonable across
the board for all CPUs the next closest
Intel apart is the 70 through 50k
presently $70 more than the 45 60 in the
US and it's about 19% faster than the 45
60 in the present state of the game with
our benchmarks the r5 1400 and r3 1200
round out the low-end of the pack
near 94 FPS average here's where it gets
interesting switching to 1080p with high
settings you likely barely noticed that
the charts changed a lot of the numbers
remain the same or similar with minimal
scaling when reducing the high settings
many of the options that change between
high and highest are GPU limiting like
depth of field and ambient occlusion and
so won't appear in CPU constrained tests
we've got fxaa enabled so that's out as
a variable but if you had MSAA you'd
also see a huge GPU side hit the
performance stack is largely the same
here we've gained a few FPS for the r7
and r5 but otherwise the results are
effectively within test and test
variants we'd have to manually adjust
CPU limiting settings to get a better
idea here like items governing geometry
LED and view distance but as we already
saw it doesn't seem to do a lot we also
added 1440p to test and to get an idea
for how or if the CPU Delta's close as
more load is placed elsewhere in the
system the answer is yes with highest
settings the i7 7700 K falls to 109 FPS
average from its 170 perch previously
with 1% lows at 80 a 1001 % at 79 the
7600 ki 5 is now just behind the 7700 K
indicating a GPU bottleneck at this
resolution this is why higher
resolutions and graphics settings serve
as an equalizer for CPU performance in
many instances even the i3 is nearby and
averages that technically lower in frame
times behind the i3 is the 1600 X now
getting closer to the chart-topping CPUs
and performance and this is thanks to
resource limitations else we're almost
assuredly the GPU we're at a deficit of
6.9% to the 77 hard K now rather than
the bigger gaps earlier the 1,700 at 3.9
gigahertz performs effectively
identically with invariance and the 1700
is nearby it's not until we hit the r5
1400 and r3 1200 that frame rate drops
reasonably below the 100 FPS range
finally switching over to the 1440p high
settings we see general uplifts for
parts across the board with FPS
approaching original values there are no
big changes here when compared to the
1080p high values if you look between
them the charts all the numbers are plus
or minus a couple FPS of each other so
some might be lower some might be higher
about the end of the day there with
invariance that's it for this one the
biggest thing here to take away is the
front
the video or the article where we talk
about all of the exploration of the
games options the different parts of the
game the performance anomalies things
like that the comparative data is
interesting and hopefully put some
information out there but keep in mind
that one doesn t twos and beta-2
we'll see how it changes on the other
maps game zones and modes that are not
are not released yet or not fully
released yet so there's a lot of room
for changes here
the takeaway being and what I'm really
trying to instill into people's minds is
rather than taking charts copying and
pasting them places when you see people
do this because they will rather than
copy and pasting charts places and
saying X CPU is better than y cp you
just remind those people that there's
some variance here we're not fully
confident in the comparative results
right now because of Bungie and destiny
to is kind of weird interactions with
well there's a lot of things a lot of
stuff we didn't go over but switching
between the highest low settings things
like that there's so little impact on
the CPU that you really start to
question what's going on so there might
be more room in there for the CPUs to
improve we'll just have to find out and
part of that will be waiting for the
game to launch officially part of it
will be having enough time to dig
through every part of the game graphic
settings things like that that's not
something we can do alone so we'll look
for other reviewers and users who are
able to explore the game and report
their experiences so please contribute
it to that discussion if you get the
game once it comes out let us know what
your experiences in different areas of
the game so we can try and look into it
