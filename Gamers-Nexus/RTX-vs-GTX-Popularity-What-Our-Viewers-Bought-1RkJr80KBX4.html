readers and the video cards that you all
bought we charted the most popular video
cards over the launch period for
Nvidia's r-tx devices as we were curious
if gtx or r-tx gained the most sales in
this window we've also got some AMD data
toward the end but the focus here is on
a shifting momentum between pascal and
taurine architectures and what the
consumers want before that this video is
brought to you by Thermaltake and the
view 71 enclosure the view 71 is a full
tower case that's capable of fitting
three video cards and most
configurations it's also one of the
better cooling cases in our recent case
testing bench lineup the view 71 has
hinged a tempered glass doors on either
side that make it easy to open and show
off and it comes with at least one rain
fan though you can get the RGB version
if you prefer learn more at the link in
the description below so for this video
we're using referral sales data from our
audience
only to look at the popularity of GTX
and r-tx primarily with some AMD mixed
in the idea here is just looking back
now now that we've have had the
perspective of launch to see how the new
cards perform how the price proposition
is and we've had some time for GTX to
slowly dwindle from supply we can look
back and see do people really want card
a versus card B where in this instance
that might be the twenty eighty where's
the 1080i or the twenty atti versus the
previous high-end flagship because the
pricing now is so different the way it's
structured with the 28 DTI being over
$1,200 in a lot of instances it really
pushes the market and moves the type of
device that people purchase so that's
what we're looking at today a couple of
really important notes here this sample
size although it's it's pretty large a
couple hundred samples for our audience
for this particular main set of charts
it's not representative of the whole the
inherent bias here we'll lean the the
sales data toward whatever our audience
buys that does not mean it's
representative of everyone you can't
take this data and extrapolate it to
what may be Linus tech tips audience
buys or what the general Amazon consumer
buys who doesn't even know we exist so
this is only for our audience it's very
much what do you all buy who are
watching this on average and that will
typically skew a
bit towards the high-end as well so we
have a lot more data focused in that
segment of the market market where
you're looking at 1080i class 2080 maybe
1070 TI class Vega 64 somewhere in there
for pricing has been pretty popular for
our audience so that set of sample bias
it's very important to note you can't
extrapolate this market wide but it's
still very interesting data for what do
hundreds of users in our viewer base and
readership purchase when they're buying
new graphics cards and video cards for
their high-end or otherwise any gaming
machine really because we have some low
on cards in there too so let's walk
through the data and see what it looks
like for market distribution between the
different types of Nvidia and AMD
devices using a sample size of several
hundred purchases from our audience we
can plot this chart to look at
popularity of cards between the 10 and
20 series note that again this isn't a
perfectly representative distribution of
all buyers but it is for our audience
most of our referred sales are in the US
market which means that this favors at
US market conditions and prices also
although several hundred samples is a
pretty good amount it's definitely not
fully representative of the millions of
video cards sold every year
this chart shows sales between the dates
of August 20th and november 1st August
20th is the day that the r-tx 20 series
was announced and put on pre-order so
we're not starting our data collection
until the r-tx series was made available
we can see that the GTX 1080 Ti
distribution holds a significant lead at
65% of all sales the GN viewers the next
closest card is the RT x 2080 at 8%
which is followed by the gz x 1080 at
about 8% roughly and the 1070 Ti is
nearing 5% after that the 1070 TI and
2070 are roughly equal in this
distribution just to help visualize
total market distribution here's a pie
chart for each device the gtx 980ti has
been an immensely popular card and
NVIDIA deserves tremendous credit for
making something that has held relevance
all the way through now it's highly
popular it's a good performer and the
price proposition is very strong
the 2080 performs about the same as the
1080i telling us that our audience has
favored high end GPU purchases over the
last few months so far all this tells us
is that the 1080 TI sales far and away
exceed everything
at least for the past couple of months
but it doesn't tell us if there began a
switchover period upon launch of the 20
series we can use an overtime chart for
some of that this is plotting only the
gtx 1080i for gtx and is not taking into
account all of the other gtx cards all
our TX cards are plotted under one
banner here overall sales for our
audience were slow and people largely
stopped buying GPUs that leading up to
the review embargo lift again in our
audience the highest amount of our TX
sales happened on day one of this plots
where the cards were announced put on
pre-order but weren't yet reviewed again
remember that this data is inherently
biased towards our audience and our
content we told people to hold purchases
and wait to see our review and it looks
like the purchased trends followed that
advice our content would bias the data
toward either no purchases or GTX
purchases primarily so keep that in mind
again this isn't some massive market
study it's just our audience and that's
based on our content and the type of
people who watch our content different
audiences may have swung the other way
we don't know without other content
creators talking about it on data review
embargo lifts there's a massive spike in
total and video sales for the GTX 10
atti these percentages are based off of
all GTX and r-tx sales not just the 1080
TI and RT x so this spike is substantial
our review of the RT X 2080 came first
and noted that it was not worth buying
when compared to the 10 a TTI which at
the time was priced very well in the
market it was a bit cheaper than 28 es
at launch day this seemed to align with
embargo lifts day data that only GTX
sold for at least again our audience our
28 ET GI review was next and noted that
the 2080 Ti is objectively good it's
just expensive compared to even to the
RT X 2080 very few 2080 TI's moves and
this is likely due to price it was just
a bit too much for even our high-end
purchasing enthusiast audience from this
point on most sales were GTX numbering
in the hundreds for all Pascal cards
combined we also don't yet know if this
is standard behavior for a new
architecture launch and unfortunately
our readership was smaller when the gz x
1080 launched so we still have enough
data to make a basic
but we're working off far fewer samples
and that does mean that the data is more
difficult to really draw conclusions
from anyway let's throw a chart up just
to see what it looked like in this chart
you're looking at the Pascal launch for
the GTX 1080 and 1070 as compared to the
900 series we saw a similar behavior
with the 900 series cards more popular
for our audience of 2016 and remember
this is when we were largely drawing
most of our readership via the website
we didn't have much of a youtube
presence just yet that said sample size
is under 100 units so we really can't
draw too many conclusions here the 10
series comprised of a total of 12
percent of all sales logged for the GTX
10 series launch window measured over
the same time period as the RT X vs. GTX
launched the 970 remains the most
popular card true even today where it
has been one of the best selling cards
of all time if you're curious about AMD
sales during these time periods here's a
chart recalculated with those numbers
and these are rx 588 shares the same
popularity is the GTX 1080 and this is
during the RT X launch window so it's
the same period as the first chart the
RX 5 beta is a bit more popular than the
1070 TI the 1070 in the 27 t in this two
month launch window
remember this is just that couple of
months so Nvidia is driving the most
marketing during this time they're
spending the most money on driving their
product put it in front of people's eyes
and everyone's thinking about Nvidia so
that will skew data towards and video
purchases the Vega cards were at roughly
2% sales during this period for 56 and
60 for each we really have to emphasize
just how crazy the 1080 TI sales are
during this window it's not like that
year-round but the timeline biases data
again toward the high end since most
users were waiting to purchase RT X or
the predecessor and our audience seems
to be largely enthusiasts aligned that's
all the data we have for you on this one
so like noted in the content there's not
a ton of data that we have from the 2016
launch window for the 10 series because
our viewership was much smaller at the
time we had more readers and viewers and
even that wasn't all that large so that
does mean that we have the most reliable
data for the r-tx launch because we've
got way more samples in the distribution
the sample size that we
like that and that data does indicate a
very strong presence for the 1080 TI so
definitely definitely kudos to Nvidia
for making a card that has survived time
to an extent that it is even out
matching its own new devices for sales
and now this is true previously as well
even with the limited sample size we
have where it's limited to a point of
being difficult to draw conclusions up
for the 900 series versus the 10 series
unlike now where we have a lot more data
to work with for the nine Art Series
worst ten series we saw a similar trend
it was largely a 900 series purchases
when the 10 series launched from our
then much smaller audience and that's
probably partially normal its it's not
necessarily because our TX is
universally disliked or something
although the artifacting could play a
part of the purchases the the lack of
our TX features and games could
absolutely play a part of purchases but
it's also because just the older
generation is probably cheaper than it
has ever been it's probably readily
available where the new generation
always sells out within a couple months
most likely maybe even the first week
depending on how popular it is so these
types of things influence purchasing
decisions by buyers of course and it
seems somewhat normal that the 10 series
would exceed 20 series sales within the
first two months of the 20s reason
existing but at the same time you have
to look at it and really give credit all
right 10 80 TI at 65% of all of Nvidia
sales for that 2 month launch window of
our TX is staggering and the fact that
the 1080 Ti is soon leaving the market
because not being made anymore really is
going to shift a lot of those buyers to
the 2080 because it's not gonna have
anything else to buy in its place so
that's going to force the hand of people
who want a high-end device and won't be
able to get a 1080i unless they wait
around or maybe they really jump up
their spending to a 20 80 TI and that
that price increase is just so large and
the 20 80 TI makes up very little of the
total market share from our audience of
video cards that it just seems more
likely people will stick with 20 80 90 i
or down class to something else if they
can't get something like he used the
card and that's another good point is
that our data does not include used card
purchases and also does not include
of anything from I mean just second-hand
market in general if it's in from Media
Markt or Saturn or any of those European
based retailers we don't have sales data
for them we are just looking at Amazon
and Newegg primarily for our sales data
I think we have some Nvidia tracking as
well but it kind of it's not quite as
effective so so that the data is very
much centered on us audience we have
some audience sales data from UK buyers
and Germany buyers but we don't have
their specific regional retailers which
does limit the sample size a bit so Neri
pretty interesting stuff nothing you can
draw hard conclusions from but we
thought we'd share it with you because
it does show a bit of the purchasing
trend and out of hundreds of units to
have more than half of them go to the
1080 Ti is really crazy so that's it for
this one pretty simple content really
just something a bit different and
interesting and as always subscribe for
more go to patreon.com/scishow cameras
and stops out directly or go to store
that gamers access net to pick up a
shirt like this one we have as of
filming this we have about 20 left so
they might be gone by the time it goes
up but you can pick up the shirt there
if it's still there it's limited we're
not gonna make more so there's one of
the last chances you'll have to pick one
up thank you for watching I'll see you
all next time
