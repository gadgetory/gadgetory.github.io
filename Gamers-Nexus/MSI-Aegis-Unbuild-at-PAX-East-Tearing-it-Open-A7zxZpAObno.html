booth at PAX East 2016 and we looked at
that AJ's PC this is a bare-bones PC and
we have the opportunity it's pretty much
disassembled to hold in and look inside
that's what we're going to talk about
here before we get into this all of our
PAX East 2016 coverage is brought to you
by cyber power PC who are awarded the
best desktop gaming PC board from PC
Magazine so this thing it's a $400
bare-bones PC the power supply's action
the bottom of this enclosure here which
is effectively a stand for it and these
are not separable as far as I'm aware
maybe somewhere hidden under there but
far as them were not separable
accessible in the back for the power
plug and that is a 600 watt power supply
and that's rated 80 plus Silver's
that'll pretty much handle every single
card configuration out there right now
as far as video cards this is your space
you're limited to whatever that is four
space single GPU configuration only it's
running a be 150 chipset motherboard
from MSI so that is included video cards
not included and CPUs not included rams
are included so what you get is the case
that power supply the motherboard and
the CPU cooler which is pretty
interesting as you'll see in our videos
and photos the cooler is an effectively
it's an air cooler but it looks a bit
like a CPU one kind of or a liquid one
kind of deceptively and that's because
it's got sort of a cold plate low to the
block like a CPU pump might have and
that's all copper and alloy as as usual
and then there's a blower fan hooked up
for the dissipation for air so in theory
it should be able to pull a bit more air
through there than a push fan a push fan
you really wouldn't be able to dissipate
the heat just by nature of being such a
condensed enclosure so that is the ages
as we know it right now there are more
models coming in the future we don't
know a lot about them but we'll
definitely update you as it comes out
because couple small things here there's
a badge in the front it's not a button
doesn't do anything and then there's the
mystic lights set up in the front as
well with their RGB LED lights and
that's just part of a massage branding
so 400 bucks bare-bones PC and it's on
Newegg now I think but don't buy it just
yet we'll review it and let you know how
you can make a decision from there after
our thermal benchmarking because I am
very curious how this performs thermally
so that's all I have for you check the
links of patreon in the postal video and
links to other PACs content we'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
