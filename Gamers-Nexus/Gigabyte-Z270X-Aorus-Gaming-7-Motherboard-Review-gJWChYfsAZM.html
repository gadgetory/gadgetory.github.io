motherboard is the first of three on our
bench for review having housed the Intel
i7 7700 K for the past week or two will
next be looking at the MSI gaming Pro
carbon and MSI tomahawk C 270 boards and
hope to soon expand that some H and B
250 chipset looks for today it's the
gaming 7 from gigabyte for which we've
recruited build Zoid for overclocking
analysis before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by a thermal
take and their $100 core p3 chassis the
p3 can be wall mounted and makes for a
unique easy access test bench for
convenient Hardware swapping learn more
at the link below we've already reviewed
the intel i7 7700 k kb lake cpu in
another video and article which will
link below if you haven't seen that yet
but now we're going to focus on the
chipsets at least for a little bit
anyways e2 70 is the one on the table
here and that is obviously replacing z1
sony the only major differences between
these other than intel obtain support is
that there's expanded HS io lanes
available on the z to any platform
here's a look at the block diagram for
z2 70 will throw z170 up on the screen
for reference as you can see the biggest
difference is that Intel now allows for
us a ports more importantly intel has
added for HSI ole aims to the chipset
allowing now for a maximum total of 30
high-speed IO devices we've explained
this a few times before but the lanes
that I'm talking about can be shared
with things like Gigabit Ethernet USB
3.0 and other high-speed i/o devices as
the name would suggest and this also
includes the capability by motherboard
manufacturers and to some extent Intel
to peel off lanes for additional PCIe
devices up to a cluster so to speak up
by 4 so you can pull off out of the HS
io lanes and the chipset sets of 4 lanes
that go to PCIe and that's not
necessarily a hard PCIe slot it can also
be m dot 2 devices and things that are
enabled by PCIe lanes but might not
actually be a traditional PCIe slot so
this means that with the by 4 limitation
and this is not new for cable 8 this is
old news at this point with the by 4
limitation you're generally not using
that to add more GPUs this is a common
misconception
people think that the chipset dictates
their GP lane availability and to some
extent that is true or possible anyway
but it's mostly the cpu that is leverage
for those lanes for the GPU so you pull
off for if you plug in a GPU you're
basically limited to a by for setup and
with multi-gpu configurations that means
basically crossfire because nvidia sli
wants by eight more realistically you're
using these lanes for things like SSDs
that live on PCIe slots either through
AIC is or through m dot 2 devices the
PCIe lanes through the chipset have now
increased to 24 3.0 up from 20 on z170
and H 270 also sees an increase in total
PCIe lanes and HS i/o lines regardless
we've already broken down the chipset
differences in our Intel KB Lake review
and proceeding chipset differences
content so you can check that out in the
link in the description below for more
information getting back to the
motherboard review at-hand gigabytes
board on the table here is at an MSRP of
$240 that puts it up in competition with
some ROG boards it's certainly one of
the more expensive ones that will be
available and the other ones we're
looking at like the gaming Pro carbon
fall closer to the 161 $70 price point
so that's what you're interested in stay
tuned for the coverage after CES which
will be at this week so for this board
the Auris badge means that it is
equipped with of course RGB LEDs that
has been the thing for the last year and
still is so those are on here there are
RGB LED arrays between the RAM slots if
that's your thing there's RGB LEDs
pretty much everywhere the peak the core
vrm the PCIe slots below them there are
a couple of LEDs and Ram and then some
of the shielding over here the i/o
shields which she can remove if you
prefer for what it's worth there's also
a laser etched acrylic housing thin on
the right side of the board that can be
illuminated and you can swap it out if
you want to laser at your own option
instead getting back to more mission
critical things board layout includes
multi BIOS with two different firmware
chips a toggle switch bounces between
them as you'd expect and additional caps
which toggles can be used to regulate
gain of audio output moving on the board
there are buttons present for power
overclock application and eco mode the
latter two do require gigabytes easy OC
software to use
so it's not just going to work even
though they'll light up and eco-mode
doesn't really seem to do a whole lot
doesn't really reduce power at least any
meaningful amount but gigabytes got
issues with voltage and power draw
anyway and we'll get to that in a moment
troubleshooting features include
additional LEDs with legends for
Diagnostics that's a huge plus alongside
the expected 7 segment display also a
valuable addition as for the vrm design
and layout we spoke to build Zoid of
actually hard core overclocking about
this and he has a separate video for us
going up on this channel so subscribe
for that which will have a full analysis
of the vrm and some of the overclocking
capabilities but I've got the basics for
you here I worked with builds ahead to
do some basic resistance probing on the
motherboard so we could at least figure
out what we think is an 8 plus 3v RM so
it's eight plus three phases 8 for the
core and then 3 for the GPU the basics
are that the 8 plus 3 setup appears to
be doing some sort of trickery our
current theories are that gigabyte is
either switching on two phases at a time
or is using something like a doubler to
assist in its setup VCC sa and vc cio
are using minor v rms located elsewhere
on the board and this as far as the core
vrm goes isn't a real 8 phase it also
doesn't really matter for skylake in kb
lake at least for most users and kb lake
is basically skylake just with taller
fin height and wide and gate pitch
unless venturing into more extreme
overclocking territory at which point
you may be considering a different
motherboard anyway most overclocking
endeavors will do just fine with this a
plus 3 setup regardless at 125 see the
vrm should handle well over 200 amps on
v core with the GPU BRM capable of
handling 80 amps and up at 125 c and
this is assuming a pretty safe 500
kilohertz switching frequencies or
giving it a bit of an assumption there
but most boards are in the 200 to 300
kilohertz range so adjust as according
to those changes
I mentioned voltage issues earlier and
that's what we're talking about now so
kb lake in our review of the 7700 k is
pretty easy to demonstrate that between
two different motherboards in this case
the gaming seven here and the game pro
carbon from msi we were seeing
drastically different temperatures this
happens because of the voltage
configuration in theory the idea is
supposed to be read off of the cpu so
the CPU says I need this much voltage
and the motherboard
complies with auto settings anyway and
what's happening is what appears to be a
gigabyte biocide issue which could be
resolved through a firmware update but
is at least in this version of the board
a problem reading voltages way more than
what's necessary to operate at stock
settings this is something we've been
communicating with Intel and gigabyte
but haven't yet received a resolution
here's a reprint of our charts used in
the Saudi 700k review gigabyte with auto
settings and an otherwise out of box
configuration is pushing at times one
point 404 volts to the CPU during load
and this is absolutely unnecessary
that's with a 4.5 gigahertz clock rate
we're able to sustain the same four
point five clock by manually tuning V
cord to around one point one eight volts
and that's without any instability
issues demonstrating that gigabytes of
voltage frequency table is definitely
over-ambitious and what it's supplying
to the core what's the downside of this
well it's temperature as you probably
guessed running an unnecessarily high
voltage for an auto configured out of
box fresh from factory motherboard on
the 7700 K is resulting in again one
point four volts throughput and that
means that we're getting temperatures of
something like 94 see when this boards
competitor at least a cheaper competitor
is performing about twelve Celsius
cooler and that's because of the
unnecessary voltage even though the CPU
remains stable in either state and this
is just to reiterate with a Krakken X 62
C LC this is one of the best closed-loop
coolers on the market it's $160 and
further it's with that cooler using both
140 millimeter fans to 80 millimeter rad
at full rpm so that's 1800 rpm with the
pump also at max rpm and the
temperatures on this board are still 94
C with the out of box settings and
that's on an open-air bench just to
further drive it in how big of an issue
this is so if you buy the board and you
don't think to check voltage which if
you're running auto why would you then
what could happen is you're running into
thermal throttle issues it probably
won't damage your cpu intel has
protections in place for that but you
will definitely see clock reductions and
we saw them and talked about them in the
Intel review of the 7700 K so open air
bench with an ambient
of about 20 see maybe 22 &amp;amp; $160 closed
leave liquid cooler with a an
approaching unbearable our fan rpm we're
getting 94 C so that's not good
hopefully gigabyte fixes it can be
resolved through BIOS updates and of
course it can be resolved by user input
you can go in manually set the voltage
to something like one point two seven
five if you want it to be at the high
end or maybe one point two and probably
be fine it's very easy to check
stability if it's not stable then just
increase it slightly but not to the one
point four that gigabytes running and
just again for perspective Emma sized
board that we have tested so far is
sitting at around one point three two
volts for the same auto settings where
gigabyte was doing about one point four
that's for four point two to four point
five gigahertz on the clock we're also
pushing more wattage to the CPU as a
result of gigabytes configuration big
surprise there so you're drawing more
power and of course drive more heat that
lands the CPU at 133 to 138 watts at the
high end where Emma sighs at lower V
core Auto settings land us at around 100
watts with maximally 111 watts that's
much lower obviously if we look again at
temperatures and voltages we are able to
get the CPU down to a way more
acceptable 70 C with a manually adjusted
voltage of about one point eight eight
to one point two eight volts depending
on what the CPU wanted at the time so to
recap that's a 24 C reduction in
temperatures just by us going in there
and changing the voltage which is
trivial and hopefully gigabyte does soon
for their BIOS because the table is
clearly referencing a much higher number
than is necessary now the good news here
is that even when overclocked in using
their auto OC which they call CPU
upgrade so something like 5 gigahertz
which trivial with kb lake at least the
7700 k we're still seeing the same
voltage so it's not doing something like
one point seven volts or anything insane
like that it's still sticking around one
point four so at least there's that but
it's not a great piece of news overall
so it is easily resolved though you can
fix it or gigabyte could but at $240
it's not something that you should have
to worry about let's move on to UEFI and
look at something like gigabyte does a
bit better than the v core settings the
options overall or what you'd expect
from a gigabyte motherboard any owner of
a high-end or moderately high-end z1
seven years e97 gigabyte board will
recognize UEFI overall and its options
there are a few newer options here a VX
tuning for overclocking is a nice
addition for more extreme overclockers
as is the presence of VCC PLL
overclocking for users of Alan two
gigabyte has also resolved issues with
PWM not working properly unlike some
previous gigabyte motherboards this II
270x gaming seven actually uses a PWM
signal rather than direct voltage
control for fan speed adjustment this is
important for users of maglev fans or
fan splitter hubs so good on gigabyte
for finally fixing that speaking of fans
the board does make abundant use of full
PWM for pin headers which is always nice
to see and we can also appreciate that
their support for upwards of two amps
throughput on the hybrid fan headers
with OCP available there are a few
additional pin outs that are designated
as pump headers on the board and in BIOS
that's useful for isolating cooling
solutions by label and then while it was
on the bench gigabyte gave us a
pre-production BIOS fix that resolves
the memory overclocking so achieving
thirty-two hundred megahertz XMP is
really not a problem the z2 70 board it
supports it completely to disclose some
preferences here because it does matter
for this section I'm a fan of the older
school approach to bios where you use a
keyboard and no mouse and then ideally
you give me something without a bunch of
graphics and useless speedometers and
things like that because I just want the
options in a tree listing that you can
arrow through and hit enter to modify to
that end gigabyte has done it well this
does not have the insane amount of
graphics knobs speedometers and car
references that for example MSI's bios
almost embarrassingly uses despite being
good bios overall just kind of not
necessary
so gigabyte doesn't do all of that it
does have some issues with the mouse and
to quote build Zoid if you're going to
have a mouse in there at least make sure
it works gigabytes mouse works but it
feels like it's stuck on an XY grid
sometimes where it won't quite do
diagonal movement unless you whip it
across the desk so that could be
improved on again thankfully this is
something that can be improved on
through a BIOS update it's not a
hardware level issue just like the vcore
one is probably not a hardware level
issue the gigabyte z2 70 x RS gaming 7
motherboard is
optimal I guess if you fix the vcore
issues it's not bad and that's the major
point of concern so all these other
things really in the face of the V Corps
it's pretty much irrelevant
once that's fixed this board will be
much easier to recommend I do have a few
caveats I'll mention in a second but the
majority of system builders who buy
something like this assemble a system
are probably not going to check v core
if they're running out of box settings
for the CPU or the motherboard and even
if you do some lightweight overclock and
it's still pushing more voltage than as
necessary at times depending on the
clock rate so that should be resolved
there is a temperature Delta that we've
measured between our samples that can
vary by sample based on the soldering
and the thermal paste application but
our samples show about 6 to 7 C Delta
between skylake and kb lake and that is
not terrible but it's exacerbated by the
gigabyte v core which creates more like
a 20 C Delta between its competitors so
I'd like to see that fixed that's why
I've spent so much time talking about it
today the price for the motherboard $240
is a bit ambitious I think I would
personally not be paying more than like
170 hundred $80 of this Maxx 200 but
probably 180 is where where I would
invest my money and the LEDs if you
really like them I guess the board has
them but the problem is everyone has
them now so even at the 165 dollar price
point if that's what you care about and
you don't really need any other features
you can get it for cheaper and it looked
basically just as good so it's a tough
selling point 240 bucks is drifting
toward something like some low-end
entry-level ROG boards and those
generally have better options for you if
you're an overclocker if not then get
something cheaper and for any kind of
extreme overclock and generally you will
want as we've learned from speaking with
build Zoid something like an ROG board
and ax power board something like that
from MSI or Asus and we might look at
those later for now this is
over-ambitious the LEDs are ok but do
not make up the cost and gigabyte at
least has done well with forward
thinking on liquid cooling this board
has the pomp adders which star
really that special but they do label it
pump so that's nice and then there are
other boards have the ek water blocks
connectors which is also good forward
thinking so they've done some things
well it's just not enough hopefully the
price drops if not we might be looking
at other boards that are cheaper from
gigabyte in the future we'll have the
gaming Pro carbon up soon
