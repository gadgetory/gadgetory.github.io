Titan r-tx which we bought for $2,500 so
it's a bit cheaper than the Titan V we
bought last year but it's still pretty
up there the good news is it's still got
that champagne gold color that goes so
well with Jensen CEO Edition Titan VIII
as previously and also our GN beer glass
if you want to mix and match there but
this we need to tomorrow the finish
unfortunately do a little damage to it
take it apart see what it looks like
underneath and what we need to look at
first is the PCB to see if it's the same
as the 28th ETI founders edition or if n
video went with something custom for
this hire probably a higher power
consumption version of the taurine high
end GPU so today we're doing a teardown
of this card before that this video is
brought to you by us and the gamers
access store you can go to store
documents access dotnet to pick up one
of our ceramic mugs critically acclaimed
mod mats or educational video card tear
down and PCB Anatomy posters that teach
the names and placements of all the key
PCB components
learn more at stored at gamers XS net or
click the link below if you're wondering
what's new with this other than the
champagne gold finish like the Titan V
and the GN beer glass it is well that's
really it we need to take it apart to
see what else is different because this
cooler it's the same as the founders
Edition cooler that you saw on the
twenty-eighth eti 2080 to 2070 same
thing so nothing different there they've
got the same slot size the same fin
stack and presumably vapor chamber under
that so not a whole lot is different
externally it really is just the color
internally of course there's a bigger
well it's it's the 20 atti die at least
the size of it it's just that there are
more SMS enabled so that's really the
the change there because the die itself
should in theory be about the same size
it's just that they've got a couple of
SMS that are disabled on the 28 ETI and
this is the full tu 102 GPU
which be the biggest one we presently
know of as being purchasable for or
actually even just possible for the
current Aryan architecture okay so this
begins our journey of taking out a
million screws fortunately we're not
going to take out every single screw
this time because there are over 70 in
these cards we're just going to take out
enough to get the thing apart and take a
look and then if you are planning to do
this kind of disassembly yourself we
would advise avoiding taking apart the
cooler that's the part that really sucks
but you don't have to take the cooler
apart in order to get to the PCB you
just have to take all these screws out
of the back and then the screws out of
the i/o and then you expose the PCB at
that point and if you go to store
decking or insects net you can pick up a
mod mat like the one I'm working on and
more easily track your screw locations
but we're just going to take apart take
all these screws out and then we'll jump
ahead a little bit
so that's all the small screws for the
back plate those just secure the back
plate these secure the back plate to the
IO slot to the PCB so those come out
next and the gold isn't chipping so
that's nice but whatever not that
important that was the envy link cover
probably seen those in the past
they miss a screw no okay pretty similar
so far I feel ripped off the why isn't
it gold it's not cold like all the
others
so that's it's disappointing now we have
to take out all these these I think
these are 4 millimeter hex is the size
of these ones and it's the exact same
assembly as the previous founders
edition card so you're not learning
anything new here if you saw those we
need to get through the rest of this in
order to learn something for point out
so these are 4.0 hex in case you need to
know that which you will if you're doing
a liquid cooling mod so there's one of
these for each of those really tiny
screws this is something I haven't said
in a while but you say for every one of
these types of teardown
the tiny screws that go into these are
extremely fragile so if you need to
reinstall them after disassembly for
some reason then do not turn past the
point at which it it starts first
showing resistance because the the head
will snap from the screw shaft and then
you'll be sad because it'll be stuck in
the the hex screw underneath because
they just screw into these and it really
easy to break those screws but it's the
same ones they've been using since
definitely 10 series can't remember
thing is I'm a 9 series
there are so many screws we never did
figure out why there's so many screws in
Nvidia's design although people
internally have since made fun of it
since we made the video showing how many
screws there were there were we had two
parts the original disassembly video and
that's because we couldn't figure out
how to disassemble this thing the cooler
during the teardown which was very
disappointing for everyone in the second
part which came out maybe a day or two
later we did figure out how to do it and
the trick was if he missed it
we took a heat gun to this plate because
there's actually a ton of glue holding
this thing to the rest of the cooler and
then started I think we stuck a
screwdriver in up under there and popped
it off once the glue was was weakened by
the heat gun so lots of screws still a
lot of screws it's totally unnecessary
although to end video is credit with a
with a vapor chamber design they're
using it does mean that everything is
going to be pretty airtight and sealed
in contact so that is an upside these
screws on the IO I've since learned
since our first tear downs we did about
we did it over 1020 atti tear downs when
you all sent them in on loan to look at
the broken ones and in that process I
learned that this the tiniest screws
here are really at risk of stripping
like doesn't matter if you use the right
size screwdriver they're just there
they're in pretty tight and you just
have to apply a lot of force to break
the lock tight I don't know if there's a
lot yeah there's lock sights break the
lock tight because these will strip
easily so be aware of that as well hope
this is making people nervous just a
little nervous that's that's what I'm
hoping it does to them
Steve pretty sure that's about what the
counts are gonna say right now
okay there's removal of the IO plate
whatever you want to call it and now it
should disconnect yes okay cool
make sure I didn't bend any pins that
we're good okay cool
so part of the point of this today is so
that we can put thermocouples
on the components and see how hot they
get I've kind of already done that but
this will allow us to do it more and
we'll talk about about this more in the
next video on the review and the follow
up videos but what let's look at the
memory choice this looks like Samsung
yes Samsung and there was some
misinformation previously by mostly
internet commenters which was wrong and
suggested that micron versus Samsung
impacts or was a change made because of
the artifacting that's not true it's
just because Nvidia brought on multiple
suppliers and they'll bring on SK Hynix
probably at some point to what is it
builds I'd tell me what's the MOSFET I
forget sorry 170 okay it's still 31 70s
so this that's what I was I was trying
to confirm these MOSFETs are 31 70s just
like they were on the 20 atti
and we've still got three phase split
off for the memory up here which is
really easily identifiable primarily
because the branded on the chokes does
change but also because I know that's
what it is and then we have another one
down there yep still 45 nine two four
nine nine one this one's been through a
lot don't judge
is it identical I'm thinking yes
aha there's a very important difference
that I've just discovered you're heating
it here on gamers Nexus for the first
time you'll notice that the text is
upside down on the Titan r-tx
I didn't pay $2,500 to have upside-down
text on a minor minor inductor on my
board thank you very much you can see
they did it again here guilty of two
counts of being rotated that's that's
pretty much it it's pretty much the only
difference so yeah these are these are
basically the same these are the same
it's the same PCB this is in fact same
on the back as well so there you have it
it's a it's 2080 TI is what it is at
least well the PCB is the GPUs clearly
different we should wash that off and
take a look at it now if you're
wondering about some of this stuff down
here you see that kind of black silicon
looking stuff we talked to some people
and it sounds like it's just well it
depends on who you ask but one of our
contacts and man you and maybe you might
know more about this if you do let us
know but that black film surrounding
this V Ram is either to do with putting
some extra reinforcement where it's the
most thermally sensitive it's at the
bottom of the slot it's not really
getting in cooling that's what one of
our contacts suggested now it could be
like a thermal pad grease but that's not
what this is because it's I mean it's
not it's not grease I can feel it so
nothing to be concerned about is really
the main takeaway here we're not 100%
sure why they do it versus not but our
understanding is that they do this in
hotter areas that don't have as much air
flow or access to cooling let's clean
off the GPU
small note if you're ever cleaning
around a GP like this don't obsess over
getting the paste out around the GPU
it's not gonna hurt anything and if you
try to remove it by sticking like your
fingernail in there with a paper towel
chances are you're gonna snag a small
capacitor or service mount device and
rip it off and cause damage so generally
we we would advise just just clean the
the GPU itself or at least the diffusion
barrier which is what it is at the top
here so it is a tu 102 - 400 - a 1 and
the 20 atti
if you've forgotten is a tu 102 - 300 a
4 that's basically can a higher bin SKU
- K 1 - a 1 the last a 1 there just
means a revision it is not significant
the K 1 we're not a hundred percent sure
we had some contact suggest that it
might mean which memory module is
missing and you'll notice that there's
just a wad of paper towel here there's
no memory module here it's because 11
gigabytes this does have an extra module
it's not 12 though it's 24 and then
other than that the only difference is
is the secondary part of the SKU 300 a
400 and that's just it's the same GPU
it's tu 102 it's the same size GPU it's
the same everything it's just there's a
bit more activated more SM so you get
more cores and that could come down to
fusing things off artificially for
product segmentation sometimes it does
or it could be because in making these
well realistically in making these they
had enough of these fail with just a
couple SM is not working or something
like we're just one SM whatever not
working and then they end up down
bending it to one of these because why
throw it away if you can recover it as a
lower end product so there's your really
obvious walkthrough on that most you
probably know that already so that's it
though that's the the Titan RT X I think
there's
nothing really significantly different
so wait a minute this one is made in
Korea and this one is made in Taiwan I
think we're onto something here I don't
know maybe they make them in different
places for example so that's that's it
that's all there is to it
it's gold and it's a 20 atti in every
regard except for the part that matters
which is the GPU and the memory around
it but all the rest of it is is pretty
familiar to us so so that's what you get
when you buy one of these really
expensive Titan r-tx cards that's the
whole thing
so if you knew the Titan sorry the 2080
ti then probably not that exciting but
we still need to look at performance in
a video we've done about well most of
testing so far and and we have a
surprise for you as well coming up after
the initial review so make sure you
check back for the review now as for the
rest of this the cooler I didn't really
mention that's because the same thing as
the 20 series coolers so you've got the
sort of Fuji poly style pads here and
for the inductors for the vram for the
inductors over here you have the blue
goo pads over there and there's just
throne pads as well they're a little
squishy but throne pads there it's all
pretty standard stuff we did see
alternating throne pad choice on some 23
scarred 'z so not sure if they'll do
that with this but it's kind of
irrelevant it's just a different pad
supplier doesn't mean anything so that's
it for this one subscribe so you can
catch the review of this car that's the
part that will actually matter
apparently there wasn't anything really
special under this 2500 dollar card
although I am curious how much of the
money went towards the golden mean of
the design and you go to store documents
access net to pick up a mod mat like the
one I used in this video for teardown
and tracking your screw placement or
