of ask GN as always if you have
questions for next episode leave them in
the comment section below or in the SDN
channel on patreon of the in the discord
so for this one we have a couple
questions about under bolting and
whether that can actually hurt your
hardware and a couple of other good ones
including talking about well we have a
present for NZXT that will catch you
later in the episode before that this
video is brought to you by the new cable
mod pro series cable mods new pro cables
come with pre-installed closed combs for
clean builds accompanied by a revamped
color style and vibrance the cables are
now using thicker wires and they've also
added right-angled internal USB 3
extension and right angled SATA data
cables by the pro series cable kits at
the link below or customize that your
cable set with the configurator also
linked below prior to starting I want to
show off two new things that we just
added to the store one is a hoodie I
think it's pronounced Raglan I'm not
sure the type of hoodie where it has
different colored sleeves so it's a
two-tone and we have the GN I just gave
everyone the middle finger I mean the GN
logo on the chest and on the back side
under the blue hoodie is the teardown or
anniversary edition logo so really happy
with how it came out it's a pretty snug
fit and it's really like a lightweight
material as opposed to the other hoodies
we have that are more for winter weather
so this is more like spring or I don't
know mid 60s weather or something like
that but super lightweight and a cool
design bit different so we're pretty
happy with it that's on the store
already if you're interested and then we
also added we previously sold these
black flex fit hats and now we're trying
out a blue and white striped two-tone
hat also on the store at store rock
gamers nexus net so starting out first
of all I guess I'll point out the
previous content we did something cool
with the motherboard for that we were
talking about previously in a CSB
through the em-dash II board with no vrm
cooling and got it up to about 150
degrees internal mosfet temperature you
should check out that content if you
haven't it's from the day before this
video went up I think so first real
question NatWest said
or no twist whatever it is said can
under vaulting the GPU hurt the card in
any way particularly if during testing
you undervolt too far and it gets
unstable not really over or yeah
applying voltage to a CP or something
you can certainly damage stuff on a
hardware that will by by giving it too
much voltage you can see previous video
for that but in terms of under bolting
especially on a GPU you don't have a lot
of control or voltage for GPS anyway and
then for the level of control that you
do have if you under bolt too far and it
becomes unstable the panel which GPU
you're using one of two things will
really happen one is it ignores your
request and it just applies the voltage
it wants this is why with like everyone
talking about I under bull today a gun I
got way less power consumption okay
great
but also if you type in really as we
found if you type in a really low number
for the voltage and it looks like it's
stable it's probably just actively
adjusting upwards to accommodate as
necessary you can certainly under bolt
it and you can certainly reduce power
consumption but there's kind of a limit
to it so the one possibility is that it
ignores you if it's not enough voltage
and just adjusts on-the-fly
the other possibility is that it's
unstable and crashes or has a driver
crash or software issues things like
that and these things don't hurt the
hardware none of these would hurt the
hardware the only real thing you could
potentially lose I guess is maybe if you
have a bad enough crash that you like
some kind of bsod you could potentially
corrupt system files or the application
that was running we had this happen
recently with Raven Ridge when we had
that video
bsod issue that was related to gpu-z and
3dmark fighting over asus info file that
was out of date or different between the
two of them so in that case it wasn't an
under voltage saying however if you had
a similar under voltage while many
instability issue that caused a blue
screen of death of a high enough
severity you could maybe corrupt
something like 3dmark but it's not
really that big of a deal
windows of course I know there's always
potential potential to do damage to
Windows but I have not personally
had any issues with window is becoming
corrupt from under bolting or anything
like that it's typically like a driver
crash and you restart and you increase
the voltage and it's fine so the answer
is now especially on a hardware level
the answer's no but on a softer level
it's maybe you might I don't know he
might mess up a file or something if
it's active any crash but I'm talking
about the hardware next question is a
pimp theis guy says why did nvidia
decide to go 20 X X instead of 11 X acts
like a lot of people were saying thanks
for the great content so I think this is
in reference the last time when I put
GTX 20/80 and scare quotes the reason we
did that is because that's what everyone
was calling it that week that was the
flavor of the week and that's why I had
scare quotes around it so that's not
like the actual name necessarily that
was just me saying this is what
everyone's expecting to see when we're
talking about taurine or ampere or
whatever it's the easy way to say this
is what we're talking about and signal
it it could very well be an 1100 series
card I'm I don't know if any of the
rumors actually have stated that they
confidently know the name of the next
card so yeah the answer to your question
is Nvidia didn't necessarily decide that
everyone on the internet decided that so
I don't know maybe one of the rumors
said 20xx but it's not confirmed next
question galio says is it possible to
damage or degrade a GPU more than in a
normal use case space clocks just by
overclocking the memory to hide no or no
over-voltage power limit would be under
set kiss times like a Mayan system
parent would be under 70 and good
temperatures 55 to 60 degrees Celsius
I'm asking this because for example I
have an MSI 1063 gigabyte with Samsung
memory I can overclock it with plus 1000
and it doesn't crash when mining called
it but in benchmarking I can see
artifacts so I keep my OC at plus 700
you know I could get some extra mega
hashes I don't know enough really about
precisely how mining transacts memory
but
let's just answer this the base question
here and without the specificity of
mining and the base question is is it
possible to damage the degrade GPU just
by overclocking memory - hi the thing
that starts damaging components is
temperature is runaway thermals things
like that
so I don't what is the detail card this
is 1060 gddr5 has a spec of something
like ninety degrees Celsius I've taught
my head I don't I I I'm pretty it's plus
or minus five degrees it's in that range
so let's say 90 degrees 85 to 95
basically is if I remember correctly
what the spec is for gddr5 so as long as
you're under that you're not causing any
any serious damage I guess depending on
if you're doing any weird BIOS mods or
anything like that from mining with
playing around with voltages that could
change the story a bit but if you're
just kind of running at stock and doing
an offset on the memory I don't suspect
that you should have any long-term
damage or degradation from increasing
the frequency if there's not also a
significantly higher temperature on the
on the dies so depend on how good your
cooling is what kind of cooler you have
on the card which brand it is it should
be okay now 700 is pretty damn high
though a thousand is really high so I
don't know first question is is it
actually doing plus a thousand because
that sound that's pretty serious do like
check gpu-z and some other software
maybe do like a memory bandwidth test
and see if you can actually validate in
numbers and in scores that it is in fact
offset by plus 1000 and if it is then
great but that does sound awfully high
as far as crashing at 1000 with gaming
or benchmarking but not with mining this
is just coming down to a matter of what
type of software you're using so I can't
speak to mine specifically but I can
speak to some other things so let's talk
about fur mark and fire strike because I
know those with fur mark you can set
whatever frequency you want but fur mark
is ultimately a power virus test and I
don't know
maybe mining might be Haven I'm really
not sure but fur mark is a power virus
test so it puts a ton of load on the
VRMs and the clocks will not actually be
all that close or anywhere close
actually to what they are in reality
when you're gaming so you might see
1,200 to 1,400 megahertz clocks and fur
mark with a Pascal card and then a game
you might see 1800 but thermally you'll
be in worst case with fur mark because
it's burning the hell out of the VRMs
and you'll be in similar or worse case
with the GPU temperature so this is a
matter of what type of instruction
you're processing on the GPU and where
it's being processed which specific
piece of the GPU is being used to do the
calculation I know that at some point
with mining there is a switch and what
specific hardware components they were
using to do the calculations but I
honestly don't know enough about it so
perhaps someone in the comments can
address that more specifically and
educate all of us on what specifically
mining does these days or what it loads
on GPUs but with regard to instruction
types just to give you an example from
the CPU world one example would be
prime95
with AVX instructions written on AVX so
you go 26 point six versus twenty nine
point two or twenty-eight point five for
AVX and if you run the AVX person on EDX
with largely the same settings you'll
see way higher temperatures with AVX
workloads blender is another application
that uses AVX workloads and part of this
is because the instruction types
different and so on an Intel CPU for
example you can burn to a BX threads
versus one non AVX and so that will
increase your sort of the the density of
power in a particular spot of the die
and therefore increase the core
temperature of whatever core is being
used to do the load so the roundabout
thing I'm getting at here is although I
can't answer your specific question
about mining what I can say is that the
instruction type matters and it's very
common for some applications to be
stable with an overclock but not others
and with GPUs we see this with for
example when we tested for honor and all
of our GPU reviews we could hold a much
higher overclock with other games but
not in for honor and that was an
instance of an applique
dictating the stability it doesn't mean
that your overclock is necessarily
unstable overall but certainly of that
game or in your case the benchmark
you're talking about is part of your
daily routine
that you can't really qualify to us
stable so you step it down and adjust
accordingly because if it's a daily type
application and you want to be able to
actually be stable for it so the the
long story short of this is it possible
to down to degrade or damage the memory
basically is what you're asking by
running the overclock to high you can
always damage stuff with too high of an
overclock however the thing to keep an
eye on is your thermals so if the memory
is cooled sufficiently you've already
eliminated most of the concern and
beyond that just don't mess around with
mods that you don't know what they do I
guess so yeah hopefully someone else can
post account though about the mind stuff
because I'm curious as well as to how or
what specifically on a card mining
engages with these days I know it does
stuff with memory I don't know what it
does on the core though next question is
from Andrews Ravens who says I took my
reference r9 290x to a computer shop for
changing the fan oh and thermal pads and
thermal paste a day later they called me
telling me that the heatsink is damaged
and needs replacing I asked what was
wrong with it and they said that it had
run at high temperatures and has changed
color okay haha so first of all a shop
saying hey there's something wrong with
your car can you come back and pick it
up and you go back and and you brought
in like a silver car and then they show
you a blue one I don't I don't know that
this is I don't know that this change of
colors from your use it sounds like
something may have happened in the
repair process but I don't know so I
asked what's wrong with it they said
that I ran high temperatures okay I'm
not sure if I should ask them to get a
new heatsink because does not make sense
that it's unusable just because the
color has changed and that heat sinks
get damaged from running at high
temperatures maybe the liquid or the gas
and the heat pipes is permeated through
although that would not make sense
because
why would there be gas or liquid with a
temperature range that lets it permeate
at a temperature where graphics cards
would still work this is an excellent
point my question is that could a heat
sink get damaged from a graphics card at
100 degrees Celsius or even 120 in an
extreme case scenario at what
temperature does the gas to liquid I'm
gonna keep I permeate i I don't have a
hard number for that what I can tell you
is that your line of thought here it's
correct if you're running at 100 degrees
or let's say in your worst case 120
degrees on like the vrm or something the
electrical components will get damaged
first the rest of its copper I don't
know what exact card you have but I'm
assuming like most cards it's aluminum
and copper and aluminum and copper don't
melt or change color at even 100 degrees
Celsius if they do it's so exceptionally
minor that's completely irrelevant but
definitely not any kind of like the only
kind of damage I can think of so you've
got like it what does a heat sink
ultimately heat sink is metal aluminum
copper and solder to hold the two
together a heat sink has some liquid in
the heat pipes but they are effectively
a vacuum and and there's no reason that
that should really I don't know I mean
if it gets damaged because they if you
if you dam really heats a heat pipe
because you puncture it that's one story
but if you're just running it on the
card then no it's it's fine
other than that fans and the fans are
the first thing typically to go to the
rest is metal and metal is pretty
resilient does a hundred degrees is not
a lot for copper to take so to answer
your question I do not I can't think of
a good common normal use reason that a
heat sink would get damaged from even
running with VRMs at 120 degrees because
what will happen is maybe your VRMs are
running pretty hot maybe your capacitor
is nearby are rated for 105 C let's say
it's a really cheap card five thousand
hours maybe ten thousand hours so you
have like five K caps 105 C and that's
kind of a worst-case like cards running
the first point of failure is gonna be a
capacitor or a MOSFET or a power
component and not the metal that's
contacting those things so I don't know
I'd love to see a picture of the card or
of the damage because I can't really do
a ton with just hearing the heatsinks
damage and needs replacing but they
could be saying that the fit maybe one
of the fans is dying or maybe they've
damaged it accidentally or maybe the I
don't know I really have no idea
punctured heat pipe or something if you
tried to mod it I'm struggling to think
of reasons why a heatsink would would be
physically damaged if you just had it in
normal use but send me a like post an
injury link or something to a photo of
the card because we can include it in
the next episode and everyone upload it
so that I see it
next question Homer Thompson this is
referring to last week when I kind of
ranted about people wanting free stuff
Homer Thompson said I don't want a free
shirt but can I have a free puck well
Homer good news NZXT is very accessible
via Twitter and NZXT also likes to send
us lots of pox in fact we have quite a
few of them on the wall over there and I
would it be really a shame if anyone
tweeted at NZXT with hashtag please puck
pls puck I that would just be really
unfortunate if NZXT Zen box got a bunch
of hashtag please puck tweets because
then they then they might okay honestly
they have sent out free parks quite
often so I don't know try it tweet that
at them and link to that into this video
so that they know where it's coming from
and NZXT good luck all right next
question
blessed man Fred says why don't you guys
show off some crazy hardware builds like
a lot of other youtubers not necessarily
custom loop stuff there's a thing where
I mean we could do that at like
conventions and sometimes we do because
it's built by someone else we just show
it but our time is
is so focused on testing and advancing
test methods and processing data that
doing fancy builds it seems like the
kind of thing where I would rather give
that segment of the market to someone
else
and let the other guys focus on it
because if they can cover it well then
great we don't need to compete in that
space because we compete elsewhere and
there's just not enough time I would
have to reduce the quality of something
else to do that but at a show keep an
eye out
what's next one serpent xsf says if I
use the liquid metal on a GPI while
using nail polish or electrical tape to
protect surrounding areas how often
would I need to maintain the graphics
card with the electrical tape or a nail
polish degrade over time so it depends I
guess on the tape and the or the nail
polishes but ultimately what you're
using those things for is to protect the
components from liquid metal spillover
so the first thing you should do is not
worry about either of those and worry
instead about how much liquid metal
you're applying and maybe even just do a
test application like apply a known
amount that you can replicate mount it
pull it apart and see if there's any
spillover without turning it on if
there's not you don't really need to
worry about the nail polish or the tape
or anything else like that
because all it's doing ultimately is
protecting the components from spillover
so if you've eliminated spill over
that's first problem is solved now as
far as maintaining I we have a it's
gonna depend on the nail polish you buy
if you're using nail polish I have some
instructions on one of our articles that
lists like specific chemicals that are
ideal for a nail polish for this type of
application and I will if I forget this
remind us in the comments but I'll try
and post in the description below what
the composition is that we recommended
previously because I don't have the
chemicals memorized but but we did talk
to some people and we got answers
previously on what's best to use and
that's what I would still recommend
because I spoke to VSG of thermal bench
and a couple other people about it and
they're Bauer I believe so we'll I'll
post that in the description so that you
can see what we recommended
as far as like maintaining tape or
something like that
captain tapes and good examples of
captain tape aka thermal tape is really
good and it can stand high temperatures
like 100 T plus the power which one you
buy so that's not gonna degrade just
from the temperature because it's not
gonna get hot enough to melt it or
anything like that I have had to replace
captain tape on thermocouples and on
motherboards probably in a in an
environment where they are exposed to
dust I've had to replace them probably
about at six-month intervals if it's not
really exposed to dust it could probably
go longer because the issue tends to be
that tiny dust particles get in under
the tape and then it just loses that
adhesive quality over time not
necessarily that the heat wears it out
because they should be rated to pretty
high temperatures that exceed the
temperature the GP will be operating
that or it's not even on the GP it's
next to it so yeah in my experience
because of dust about six months and
then in my experience for nail polish
we've only started using that for about
a year on delayed CPUs and I have one
that's been running almost the whole
time
and it's still fine there's been no
degradation of it I don't know why there
necessarily would be unless just running
so hot that it's melting it but there
should be enough of a spacing between
the dye and where you apply the nail
polish I really depending on the
chemical composition the stuff we use
any way which below has not had any
degradation or anything like that it
hasn't needed maintenance you could
remove it with like rubbing alcohol or
something but that's kind of a different
story
next question two arrows said how do you
think the original out-of-the-box
thermals guy feels right now does he
still watch you I don't know do you do
you still watch let us know how does it
feel to have created the most successful
medium on her channel for which we thank
you by the way if anyone's not familiar
with it it's in one of the sgn episodes
I want to say 60 or 61 something like
that but yeah that was a good one
basically it was there's someone
complaining that we or other people
don't test CPUs for their out-of-the-box
thermal performance to which I basically
put some CPUs on the table and pointed
this at them and said uh 21 degrees
there's your out-of-the-box thermals so
that's the meme if anyone doesn't know
it that's what we came from fun fact
that test was actually flawed because
the heat the IHS is have some level of
reflectivity and emissivity so this is
not a great tool to measure them and our
testing methodology therefore claiming
that it is 21 degrees Celsius is in fact
flawed and the out-of-the-box thermals
may have been slightly different
although to be fair for being realistic
they are ultimately reflecting the room
temperature which would be ambient which
would be your out-of-the-box thermal so
we've got a nice circular loop of logic
coin there where it all works out in the
end
the next question silk monkey when did
you have a surprising triumph ie
reviving that hardware or a screw-up ie
broke apart with ESD and what did you
learn a really quick one that answers
both of those questions where it was a
sort of screw-up and sort of success in
one go
I had an AMD FX 9000 CPU I still I took
it out of the system I'm using but it
was in my personal system I have like
garbage 80 through 50 in there now that
was abused from testing and whatever but
there was 9000 CPU in there 93 70 maybe
and if anyone's ever taken and ECB's out
of the socket the saw it's not
particularly strong in the retention
force so when you take the cooler off
sometimes if you even if you kind of
like work the cooler sideways a bit when
you take it off it can just like pull
the CP out of the socket and so one of
the times when I did that the thrown
paste had basically become glue by the
time I removed the cooler and when I
pulled it out the one of the pins from
the CPU was left in the socket when I
removed the CPU and so you're looking at
it you look at the socket there's a pin
in there and so that was the the
screw-up and I don't I don't fully blame
myself for that because I did try to
remove it properly first
the success was I just decided okay this
motherboard is designated for the CPU
and the other CPU will ever go in it and
I put the CPU back in and applied enough
pressure and the pin being in the socket
was still contacting the CPU and if
anyone's saying well but some pins are
unused on TVs you're correct however I
went and removed that pin with tweezers
put the CPU back in and I had a memory
channel issue so it actually wasn't
necessary pin and just just sort of
dropping it into the socket and then
clamping it all back down it all worked
so that would be the answer to that one
I think I have couple quick ones left
and then we'll have our patreon version
of this so next one Carl says with all
these tempered glass panel cases coming
out like the coarser 500d with gaps
between the panels for dust entry does
this affect air flow or thermals with
the case or is it minimal with a
non-gaap side panel perform better air
tight side panel cases are really
complicated because it's always gonna
tend to depend on the components you
have inside of it and a case
specifically the third will take v71 is
a good example of this it has huge gaps
in the side panels the top panel all of
them has glass everywhere however it
actually cools exceptionally well like I
remember when we requested the case I
had seen reviews elsewhere where someone
did actually do a thermal test and it
performed well enough that I was like
that's someone most of that testing we
got it in it was actually it was
legitimate like it actually performed
really well and part of the reason for
that is because of the huge gaps that
were like three quarters of an inch and
all the side panels in the front panel
so that it could actually breathe so yes
to your point that does mean more dust
will get in there especially depending
on the pressure orientation of the
system but positive or negative so so
yeah more dust will get in through there
but you're always got more dust for
airflow ideally you have filters in the
places of intake which is not the case
for most of these tempered glass caps
but if you can deal with dust
it should theoretically be better for
airflow there are instances where and we
have a review coming up in the next
couple weeks there are instances where a
a set up with no top intake can't
perform better for thermals gonna set up
with or I should say no no top fans at
all it's hard to talk about because like
a product that's under NDA but I can
give me the basics so I imagine a case
with no fans on the top but there is a
mesh on the top there's holes so in that
configuration there are use cases where
the CPU can be cooler with no fans up
there and even no fan directly across
from the CPU then if you put a fan
directly across from the CP on the front
of the case because of how the air
pressure will pull some of that air up
and out through the top of the case as
opposed to air drafting down and in and
into the CPU cooler and if that's
confusing I'm speaking ambiguously on
purpose we have review coming up
eventually in the next couple weeks that
will address it further so make sure you
stay tuned for that but to answer your
question typically the thermals would be
better with gaps but it does depend on
everything else dust will be worse
though two more questions here Brom says
Steve apologies it's been asked before
but any latest ask John your answer
about commenters for a little while and
you mentioned you weren't planning on
doing pre-release content we know you
have some kind of professional
relationship with - tech tips and I saw
your float bird tweet Luke would you
consider using floatplane or rather
stick with patreon I think they can go
exist I've talked with Luke first of all
the misconception about their platform
right now is that it has to have
exclusive early access content because
that's what Linus tech tips does and I
think that's what Kyle does as well
but it's up to the Creator so you could
choose to do no early access like we do
presently aside from the very occasional
behind-the-scenes footage which tends to
just go on a side channel anyway we
don't really do early access I
personally don't really believe in it I
think it's okay to do like exclusive
content on occasion like low-quality low
production value behind-the-scenes
videos
that are basically going out to people
who support us directly to say look this
is a way to show you what's going on and
it's cool stuff other people don't get
to see and we're giving it to you
because you support us financially
however we're not gonna put a ton of
effort into it because frankly there's
not enough time and we know that
everyone has an agreement including the
patreon backers that it would be best
for our greatest efforts to be focused
on things like benchmarks and reviews
not behind-the-scenes video so I think
everyone kind of understands what's
going on there but the point is I
generally believe more in some exclusive
content pieces like that that are more I
don't know just it's like what you get
on it if you bought a blu-ray or DVD you
get kind of like directors commentary
basically so that's more of what I
believe in then early access so I have
spoken with the floatplane team we don't
have any plans right now I'm kind of
waiting and we'll work on something
later potentially but I mean I really
haven't
I have zero plans with them so yeah that
said I'm interested in the platform it
needs to develop more they have some
good ideas and the main thing I think is
that it's not all about early access its
what does the how does the content
creator want to use it so they probably
haven't really put that in messaging yet
because not a lot of people have I mean
it's just Kyle and Linus so they don't
really needed to message that to the
community but yeah
no plans presently but I've spoken with
them so it's it's not even alpha or it's
barely alpha at this point next question
is from resident peanut who says what
snowflakes out of the bed thermals well
I mean we could ask the vet but I don't
think that's no flake really likes the
process required to provide that answer
so thank you for all for watching if you
have questions next week leave them in
the comments below and we will have a
separate patreon ask to be on video
