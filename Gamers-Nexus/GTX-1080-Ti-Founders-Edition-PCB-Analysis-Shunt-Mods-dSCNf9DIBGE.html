were going to be taking a look at the
1080 TI founders Edition PTV now
interestingly enough the PCB here is
exactly the same as what you would see
on a Titan X Pascal so that means the
actual copper fiberglass sandwich that
you know pushes all these that all the
electrons move through that's exactly
the same however Nvidia has changed the
components that are used on the that are
actually attached to it and they have
added more components but before getting
to build Zoids analysis this coverage is
brought to you by EVGA and their
upcoming 1080 TI FTW 3 icx card key
learn more in the link in the
description below or watch our previous
icx review there's a lot less stuff
missing from this PCB than compared to
the Titan axes as and by missing I mean
unpopulated MOSFET mounts and that
really the only thing that's the big
loss compared to the Titan XP TV is this
memory chip right here which
incidentally you even if you had a BGA
rework machine if you have VGA soul
during equipment you can't add that
gddr5 X chip back as Nvidia disables the
32-bit memory interface for that memory
chip in the GPU core itself so you're
not getting that back that is disabled
completely no chance of getting that
working now then with that out of the
way let's take a look at the actual vrm
on the card and talk a little bit about
how about what they're made up of so
first things first up here in the top
left we find one point a 1.8 volt we are
M this powers Nvidia some of the PLL's
of the GPU it also powers the BIOS so
the EEP ROM of the Nvidia cards actually
runs on 1.8 volts so it takes care of
that and it's voltage does absolutely
nothing for overclocking it's just
necessary for the card to function so
not really that important now then down
here we find another one of these not
really that important
this is the PE X or also also slash PLL
voltage it does take care of some
internal circuitry for the GPU as well
as some internal PLL's
again it's a case of if this voltage is
not present on the card the book card
will not function this one sits at one
point zero two volts at stock and it can
help with overclocking to tweak it up or
to tweak it up or down under ln2 but on
air cooling and water cooling it does
absolutely nothing for overclocking
capabilities now then moving on we
finally get to a vrm that actually does
something for overclocking this is the V
Corps v RM and unfortunately because
this is Pascal it doesn't do much so
this applies the bulk of the GPUs power
to the GPU core runs most of the compute
logic in the core sits at around one
point zero eight volts by stock maximum
voltage limited by nvidia is one point
zero nine three volts it's questionable
if it actually can hold that voltage
steady but that is the maximum voltage
you can set in software now
unfortunately so you know you can't
really push this voltage that far
however this vrm is the one that you'll
see most custom cards significantly
changing and it does it is rather
important for ln2 overclocking but for
air cold and water-cooled overclocking
it really doesn't matter as long as
there's enough power available for 2.1
gigahertz overclocks which is generally
what pretty much every Pascal card can
hit if you get lucky
some of generally the clocks end up
between 2 to 2.1 gigahertz from what
I've been told if you increase the core
voltage of yeeah through physical mods
or a certain modded bios which exists
for only one card currently if you
significantly increase the voltage you
do not gain that much core clock that it
makes it worth it and the power of power
draw increase is quite significant
so while this vrm has been very
important on other architectures on
Pascal it doesn't really do much until
you pull the you know out of the cards
below zero again
unfortunately so that's your V core v RM
and above it we find the memory v RM
which is another case of doesn't really
do much for air cooled or water-cooled
overclocking this powers the gddr5 X
memory chips they run on 1.3 5 volts and
they don't really need a whole lot of
power and tweaking this voltage can get
you a little bit more frequency out of
the gddr5 X memory chips it's mostly
useful again on lnto where every couple
megahertz helps on air or water cooling
you'll just massively increase the power
draw for very little actual performance
increase so also you can't actually
access the crm through software
whatsoever so then finally moving on we
have another 1.8 volt vrm which I'm not
entirely sure where it's located I think
it's somewhere in this area of the PCB
again I'm working off of photos not the
actual cart
like I don't have a card in hand so it's
rather hard for me to be accurate with a
lot of these things and it should be
somewhere in this area and that's a 1.8
volts voltage and that's called that's
known as the VPP and that's able to do
necessary for the gddr5 X chips to run
it does absolutely nothing for
overclocking so not worth worrying about
whatsoever so I this this voltage might
be tied to this vrm I'm not entirely
sure I started noticing that some and
like 10 80s GTX 10 80s had a dedicated
one for this just 1.8 volts and it was
in this area
Theisen X Peas I'm not sure so I might
be wrong about that one either way it
doesn't really matter that much unless
you're trying to revive a dead card in
which case I really hope you have a
working one because that's the best way
to reference what could be wrong
now then with that out of the way let's
take a look at the V Corps and the
memory v RM in more detail even though
they don't really do much for
overclocking you probably want to know
what they are and aren't capable of so
the V Corps v RM is a bit of an odd
thing as we do have one two three four
five six seven inductors and one two
three four five six seven eight drivers
so this is perfectly fine the driver
counts at least eight drivers is
perfectly fine as this V RM is run by
the U P nine ninety five eleven voltage
controller from UPI semiconductor and
this is an eight phase voltage
controller with up to six hundred
kilohertz switching frequency how which
is actually on the low side for v RM
controllers a lot of other voltage
controllers will go up to one megahertz
or even two megahertz however that is
not that important because really high
switching frequency in your V R M means
high low power efficient basically ruins
your power power efficiency as the V R M
will be basically burning heat to turn
the MOSFETs on and off more more more
times than is necessary it can help with
the V RMS ability to regulate voltage
under very under transient loads of the
vrm up basically the voltage controller
has more chances per second to tweak the
current going through each phase however
it again like we've seen that custom
cards on the 10 custom ten series cards
do not clock any better than the
reference cards so far so again this
doesn't really matter unless you're
doing ln2 overclocking where the power
draw is significantly higher and the v
RM actually has to deal with
significantly bigger load swings so the
600 kilohertz limit here really isn't an
issue what is an issue is that we have
eight drivers and seven inductors how
does that work also we have one two
three four five six seven eight nine 10
11 12 13 14 15
Dean mosfets so we have enough MOSFETs
and drivers to build an eight phase--
vrm but we only have seven inductors so
what on earth is going on here well
NVIDIA has decided that they're going to
share this inductor between these two
MOSFETs and the you two MOSFETs and this
is done so that they can balance the
12-volt power supplies the present in
the GPU so your six pin and your eight
pin are not actually sharing their 12
volt layer of copper each of those goes
into a different light a copper power
plane so one part of this vrm will be
wired to the eight pin and the other
part of this vrm will be wired to the
six pin and some of the VRMs on this
card will be running off of your PCIe
fault connector and possibly this phase
might be to I'm not entirely sure
because from the photo I can't tell you
what these MOSFETs are actually wired to
however this is entirely done by Nvidia
to basically let them balance where the
card pulls its power from I'm not even
sure that that you actively use it well
actually no they would be using it since
they did put components on the PCB there
so otherwise that would be a horrific
waste they could just leave them out so
yeah so this is basically done by Nvidia
to balance the power draw between the
different 12-volt sources it doesn't
really do much for the vrm current
capability because all the other phases
are still limited to only two moths
that's where as this phase alternatingly
uses for so this phase is the least
likely to fail in case you push are
really if you you know have cooling
issues on the VR MN Porsche very the
high amount of current through it now
then let's talk about current
capabilities Nvidia has opted for SD PC
eight zero one 6s MOSFETs from Fairchild
dual dual MOSFETs from Fairchild
Semiconductor and so dual MOSFETs means
that this chip right here has two
MOSFETs in it there's a high side fat
and a low side fat so
the basically the end result is that we
now have two dual sets per phase so you
actually have four MOSFETs in each phase
the reason for this is that the two ICS
share the current load which leads to
them sharing the thermal load which
means lower vrm operating temperatures
as well as higher efficiency because a
big part of vrm efficiency is the heat
lost on the moss on the resistance of
the MOSFET so if you double up the
number of MOSFETs you basically get half
the electrical resistance through the
MOSFET so it gives you a nice efficiency
boost as well as a improvement in
thermals now the Fairchild Semiconductor
fdpc eight zero one six or a small sets
are pretty high-end well are actually
really like they're not but Fairchild
does make better MOSFETs than this but
among all the MOSFETs available these
are really really nice they offer
extremely low switch switch on and off
timings and they also have very low RDS
on which means that within videos claim
of this vrm being capable to do so in
video says that this erm is capable of
delivering about 250 amps if you
actually push that much current through
this vrm you're only going to be dumping
16 watts of heat which is really not
that much so if you actually upgrade the
vrm cooling to handle a lot more you can
push as much as even 400 amps at which
point you'll be hitting about 40 watts
heat output on the vrm assuming 600
kilohertz switching frequency which is
the limit of the voltage controller and
not sure that in video would actually
run the vrm at 600 kilohertz I can't
tell you what they run the vrm app from
a photo
unfortunately so 400 amps 40 watts of
heat output but where is the absolute
hard limit assuming that the arm is at
125 degrees and you have infinitely
capable cooling as long as that cooling
keeps it within 125 degrees well
theoretically this erm could go up to 8
great amps we do have a lot of MOSFETs
here do keep that in mind that that
number does work out these MOSFETs are
very very capable assuming you could
actually cool 800 amps of going through
this going through the CRM because that
would generate 156 watts of heat which
to give you an idea of what you need to
cool that with that's like a hyper 212
Evo literally just sitting on top of the
vrm not really practical not really
doable your vrm is going to fail if you
try to push 800 amps because it's going
to overheat and basically destroy itself
now that moving on to the memory vrm
which again not that important but
important enough that I'm going to talk
about it uses different MOSFETs from a
different company these are Alpha and
Omega semiconductor EC 930 s
these are worse than the fairchild
semiconductor MOSFETs
however they are ridiculous overkill as
this memory the RM is two phases we have
two inductors that you can't see because
they're under thermal pads and we do
have four of these MOSFETs and these are
again
dual sets so there are actually two
MOSFETs in each of those I sees these
are the exact same offsets and video
used on the Titan X Pascal except they
only use one of them in each phase and
they also use them for the V Corps and
they didn't do two of them per phase so
like this card got a significant upgrade
the V Corps vrm has new like better
MOSFETs and more of them and the memory
vrm has the same MOSFETs and more of
them so this card is really really nice
compared to like the Titan X Pascal's
PCD now one thing to keep in mind is
that the memory vrm will never really
exceed 20 will be between 20 and 30 amps
of power draw depending on how much load
is on the gddr5 X memory chips and the
memory system and that's really not that
much and this set of MOSFETs if you
actually assume that kind of current
going through them would have very low
switching and conduction losses and I'm
sort of suspecting that my calculation
doesn't work when you put too little
current through them like when you run
the calculation with too little current
through it because it will spits out
about one wall now if you actually try
to max out this VR I'm at 240 amps 44
amps it should put out 50 watts of heat
which is again completely uncool about
now at a half that it would be actually
reasonable now you know gddr5 x doesn't
mean that much power
so this memory vrm is ridiculous
overkill and it is too true phases as it
is controlled by an UPI while you pee
this thing right here is a u p1 6 v 8
which is a 2 phase voltage controller
with integrated gate drive however I'm
pretty sure this is a dedicated MOSFET
driver right there I'm not entirely sure
as you can clearly see that part of the
photo is very blurry and I do have other
photos but without like a mem without
the card in hand it's really hard to say
for sure
so actually covers the build quality
part of this video and to be completely
honest with you I'm impressed I'm really
impressed with on what NVIDIA has done
with this PCB compared to the Titan ax
Pascal it is a significant upgrade I as
I said before
better MOSFETs in the vcore vrm more
MOSFETs in the vcore vrm the memory of
the RM is the same MOSFETs but there's
more of them so that's also a nice
upgrade and like really there's nothing
to complain about for air cooling or
water cooling like I don't see a great
reason to go and buy a more expensive
car just for the PCB because as I said
well at least from what I've heard on
ambient cooling you're really not going
to be able to benefit from a
significantly more powerful vrm or a
significantly higher phase count v RM or
a just of erm that has a better voltage
regulation won't really get you anything
as we've seen on past 10 series cards
like 10 80s all pretty much hate to -
2.1 gigahertz regardless of who makes
them so assuming that you have enough
cooling of course which is not part of
what I'm covering here so I'm actually
impressed because this PCB is
significantly over built like nvidia
could have gone with less MOSFETs
cheaper MOSFETs and and they didn't so
I'm impressed here and you know really
don't see like a reason why you would if
something that you're going to be water
cooling I really don't see a reason why
you would go and wait for a different
PCB - kind of like for for custom cards
to come out because getting water blocks
for those is going to be harder and
everything so if you're just water
cooling this PCB is great if your air
cooling then you have to put up with the
founders edition cooler which is always
going to be worse than the custom
coolers that are available and the other
cards which is really what you want to
go after with 1080s
so then that covers the build quality
let's do some modding on this card
because evidently it's strong enough
let's try blow it up if you want to mod
the power limit of n video cards beyond
what the software allows there's a very
simple solution for you
the Nvidia cards monitor their current
draw with shunt resistors located here
here and here
now there's one issue with actually
modding these shunt resistors measure
khara power draw by basically measuring
the voltage drop across them and the
problem here is that if well the mod
works by shorting the current resistors
which lowers their electrical resistance
which lowers the voltage drop across
them when you push current through them
the problem with that is is if you short
them out too well so like let's say you
take solder and just solder right across
one of those you're going to end up in a
situation where the Nvidia driver will
notice that the GPUs reported power draw
is way too low for any kind of realistic
scenario and it'll put the car
in safety mode and safety mode foreign
video card means that the GPU core is
stuck at 139 megahertz pretty much
making the card completely useless so
what you end up having to do if you want
to actually mod the power limit on in
video cards is you either have to buy
other shunt resistors and put them in
parallel with the ones already present
on the card if you're going to be doing
that you don't really want to drop the
resistance below one-third of what it
currently is so this right here is a
five milli ohm so you would want to drop
it to say you wouldn't want to drop
below two milli ohms resistance and you
can do a calculation for parallel
resistors now the simpler less
mathematical option is to just say take
some liquid metal thermal paste so say
thermal Grizzly conduction or
collaboratory liquid ultra and just
apply that to the shunt of course that
does leave exposed liquid metal sitting
on a shunt inside your system so you
know some people aren't comfortable with
that solution but don't apply too much
apply a you know just enough to actually
short the shunts but not so much that
you have a great big blob of it on there
otherwise that will drip off and cause
all kinds of issues so you can actually
do it with the liquid metal and the
benefit to doing it with the liquid
metals instead of soldiering is that you
can actually remove the rip liquid
metals with with ethanol
acetone or isopropanol you can remove it
and it looks like you've never actually
modified the card whatsoever which is
really useful if you want to send the
card back in for our ma after it died
and that's really up to you to make this
side if that's morally wrong or not I'm
just saying that's an option the other
thing is if you overdo the mod it's
really easy to clean it up so that's the
other thing now one word of warning
about the KU Laboratory liquid ultra
I've had one person tell me that they
use KU laboratory liquid ultra and it
ate the solder so if you're going to be
doing
I recommend using I recommend using
thermal grizzly conductin aw as that one
I know for sure does not eat solder cool
laboratory liquid ultra for most people
it's worked fine from what I've heard
except this one exception which I which
I got a message about where it actually
straight-up ate the solder so and the
shunt fell off and that breaks the card
because the shunts literally connect to
the six pin to the vrm this is like that
shunt is the only connection between the
610 and the vrm so if that falls off the
card is not going to work you're going
to have to resold er that back on there
and then your warranty is toast so
that's less than ideal so that's really
all there is to say about video cards
any more advanced models would are in my
opinions like I'm not going to cover any
more advanced modes here thank you for
