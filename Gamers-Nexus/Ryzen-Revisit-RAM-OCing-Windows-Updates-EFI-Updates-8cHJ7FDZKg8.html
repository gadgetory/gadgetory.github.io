for am the risin something that we've
regularly performed for new GPUs and
CPUs as they arrive to market this one
comes sooner than most because of the
many changes which have allegedly had
significant CPU performance impact
already rather than speculate and run
tests with all of the things applied at
once like updating multiple windows or
game version simultaneously we decided
to individually test Windows updates
game updates efi updates and memory
overclocking then combine them all
together for a full picture of ryan's
progress over the past month before
getting to that this coverage is brought
to you by EVGA gtx 1080 TI icx cards the
new FTW three model which will have
three fans using asynchronous control
for their cooling of the GPU the BRM and
other onboard components you can learn
more at the link in the description
below or check our previous icx card
reviews for more information the testing
today will isolate Windows updates for
performance testing we'll also be
looking at EFI testing without any
changes elsewhere suggest an EFI update
nothing else to not take an advantage of
new EFI features then we'll be looking
at memory overclocking and eventually
compiling everything into a complete
list so this will be a cumulative set of
benchmarks that means that as we go
through things we're going to be
stacking on the previous set of charts
so Windows updates will come first EFI
next and there's EFI tests contain the
Windows updates and then after that the
memory overclocking tests which contain
the EFI updates and therefore the
Windows updates so it is cumulative in
that nature the windows update in
particular is an interesting one because
there was some talk of Windows updates
potentially impacting Rison performance
in a positive fashion but most of the
testing we saw was posted with
potentially other changes or just didn't
have initial data that we could use to
base off of for how much of an
improvement there may have been so we've
based off of our round 1 benchmark data
to see how Windows has changed over the
last month or so we put the r7 1700 and
r7 1700 acts back to the bench the 1700
X were the least excited about the 1700
was the one that if you remember we sort
of showed as the champion for the
horizon 7 lineup it was clearly the best
buy for a gaming audience particularly
because I overclocking basically made it
equal in 1800 X so it's pretty obvious
why we would choose that one in terms of
price now that said we're still putting
the 1700 X in here because it is the
most reason that we tested and for
control reasons it's the easiest for
looking at data comparatively with all
these updates applied because our 17100
had two issues achieving higher than a
twenty six sixty six megahertz memory
clock without one the newest efi updates
and two without overclocking the CPU
itself which indicates some kind of imc
limitation on our 1700 unit that we
received
but the 1700 X could hit 29 33 no
problems so we'll be able to look at
those two models for a better
understanding of how memory overclocked
in to a higher frequency like 34 66
megahertz or beyond will improve rise in
performance will tune memory later in
the video we were using EFI 5 7:04 for
the first test that is the windows
update and then we'll roll the
performance in with the newest version
which I believe is 1002 or 1 0 0 to beta
that we received from ACS directly as
for the Windows versions we will be
testing with windows build ending in 9 7
0 from March 22nd that's the newest one
at the time of setting up this test and
then that is compared vs version 6 9 3
from January 10th which is the previous
version we had on the test platform as a
note here we do not have updated numbers
for Intel or for other and these CPUs
that are not included in the numbers
today so that means that any changes in
this Windows build that may have
impacted Intel or other and these CPUs
will not be factored into cumulative
charts with everything on it because we
just we didn't rerun them we're really
focusing on rise in here so do keep that
in mind these controls in place will
have synthetic tests for you on the
website that will be linked in the
description below along with all the
other charts everything is there in
written form if you prefer that we're
going to be jumping straight into gaming
benchmarks for this video and we'll be
sticking with gaming for the entire
video the rest
n is down there in the article starting
with Metro last light reliable as its
had no updates and years we see that the
r7 1700 X performs effectively the same
as the version that's been accompanied
with a Windows Update overclock the 1700
X is within test variance for this
particular benchmark tool producing less
than a 1 FPS difference and averages
between Windows versions the same is
true for the original r7 1700 x stock
test and 1700 X Windows Update test
where we end up within about 1 FPS
average so no change the r7 1700 shows
the same average FPS for this title the
January 30th Windows 10 build post no
discernible deficit compared to the
January 10th or March 22nd builds they
all look about the same
moving to GTA 5 build 970 and build 693
produced effectively equal results
between the overclocked 1700 X CPUs
holding true also for the non
overclocked variants the r7 1700 shows a
2% difference favoring Windows Update at
this point we don't yet have enough data
to definitively state whether this
improvement is the result of Windows
updates or is it just regular variants
in testing watchdogs to paints a similar
picture we have a statistically
insignificant difference between builds
at 693 and 970 and that's for the r7
1700 X when overclocked the stock r7
1700 x with build at 970 performs at 84
FPS average where 693 performs at 82
average like with GTA 5 this is enough
to start resembling some sort of
improvement but the lack of statistical
significance in the overclocked values
gives us pause about potential for
improvement here we would need more data
to make a more definitive statement as
to whether the 2.4 percent improvement
theoretically is caused by the Windows
Update but for now this is at least
consistent with GTA 5 the r7 1700 also
posts a similar improvement of roughly
2.9 percent in averages with build 970
again ignoring the 1700 x overclocked
performance equivalent these numbers are
consistent in showing a potential
improvement with the Windows Update
however minor it may be our later tests
will impact this in theory in a bigger
way
battlefield 1 starts
join some repeatable statistically
significant differences in our 970 and
693 numbers this builds on the story
we've established with gta5 and
watchdogs - but gives us greater
confidence that the differences are more
than just chance that said quick note
here dice pushed an update called they
shall not pass for Battlefield 1 on
March 14th along with a later pushed
version 1.08 of the game
although the extensive patch notes do
not indicate any performance
improvements as stated by dice it is
possible that optimizations were made at
a game level and not listed with build
970 the overclocked 1700 X performs at
137 average we're billed 693 performs at
1:30 3.7 FPS average that's another
difference of 2.5% so not that relevant
but frame times are where it counts
because we measure frame times and
convert them into our 1% and 0.1% fps
numbers we can see that build 970 post
111 FPS at 1% lows where 693 again 2.5%
behind in averages post a 1% low of 87.3
fps finally we're seeing significant
differences it's lesson averages and
more in frame times for this particular
game with 0.1% low is also posting 8
gained from 72.7 to 99 FPS and again
these numbers are representative of
frame times the story holds true for the
stock 1700 X which runs at 135 average
at 102 1 % low and 88 0.1% low with
build 970 against builds 693 from the
original review that's an unimportant
improvement in averages but a measurable
and repeatable improvement in frame
times here's a frame time plot for
battlefield 1 on screen now while
talking to the rest of the data this is
consistent with our 1700 X numbers
although these improvements are not
visibly appreciable to the end-user
they certainly show up in charts and are
important in showing promise for
potential performance improvements in
other titles later on this chart is for
ashes of the singularity but without the
escalation updates remember we're trying
to test one thing at a time here not
throw a whole bunch of updates into the
bucket and call it an improvement that's
nice but not useful for figuring out the
source of the improvement and ashes of
the singularity we're back to what
amounts to
primarily a statistical insignificance
or very small difference overall we're
seeing an improvement in the 1700 x
overclocks numbers in b9 70 over b6 93
of roughly 1.3 percent averages with
almost zero difference in frame x when
you consider in 1% 0.1% low converted
fps values the 1700 x stock with be 693
shows again a statistically
insignificant difference this time
favoring at b6 93 which more or less
indicates test variants between two
tested values which are effectively
identical in performance there is no
difference to speak of here especially
not when the gap is 0.6 FPS the 1700 is
the same story that's the Nanak version
there's no statistical significance here
in differences and frame times are
effectively equal now we're on to total
war Warhammer unfortunately with all
this talk of constraining variables that
we were forced to update this title for
our benchmark by steam and that means
there will be changes at a game level we
reached out to our contacts at Creative
Assembly to confirm if this update
impact CPU performance and we have heard
back from the communications team but
we're waiting on confirmation from the
engineering team to see if updates have
improved CPU performance for either
vendor if we receive confirmation will
update the article link in the
description below with creative
assemblies information or quotes as
necessary we suspect the differences
you're about to see are a result of
potentially the game update more than
the windows update but either one is
critical to show so we're here anyway
the 1700 xB 970 benchmark with the game
update out matches the B 693 benchmark
in significant ways with the overclocked
1700 ex posting a frame rate
approximately 11% higher at 152 FPS
average vs. 137 FPS average same times
don't show a huge improvement in 1% lows
and the 1700 X stock goes from 128 FPS
average and 94 fps 1% lows to 145
average and one 10 FPS 1% lows another
significant improvement we replicated
this on the r7 1700 which moves from 120
FPS average to 138 FPS average with lows
also improved and here's an interesting
thing total war Warhammer was also the
game that showed the biggest difference
with
he disabled versus enabled so the next
thing to look at would be how do these
numbers align with the original numbers
with SMT off and how do they align with
SMT on and the windows end game updates
this chart contains SMT 0 values for the
r7 1700 here we show that build 970 more
or less makes up the difference in SMT
toggling indicating that one of the two
applied updates could have removed the
SMT hamstrung at least part of it that
we previously observed now of course the
question is still whether SMT toggling
benefits in this title even with these
updates and the answer is yes with the
performance ceiling still about the same
as previously at around 140 FPS average
er 7 1700 is still better with SMT off
but the differences are now minimized
the performance ceiling remains the same
in total war as previously but we're
closer to it without requiring
disablement of SMT we're moving on now
to the efi updates on the acs crosshair
6 platform we previously did test some
efi version updates with our just
research Rison article that's what it
was called and there was also a video on
it we showed really no difference that
was significant in any way on the
version we tested but this one's a lot
more advanced than those so we'll be
going through it we are on these same
windows update build as the previous
tests laid out this will be a quick
section with largely uninteresting
results and we're moving from at version
5 7:04 to version 1 0 0 2 on the ACS
crosshair 6 after which we'll do the
memory overclocking with the r7 1700
Metro last light shows no benefit from
strictly performing an EFI update on the
crosshair 6 we need to actually use
updated features as agiza
updates were not enough to impact
performance here in GTA 5 moving on
already we're seeing 0 noteworthy change
from build 970 with five seven zero four
to build 970 with one zero zero two
moving on swiftly to watchdogs
2 we're seeing no significant change
from B 970 with five seven zero four to
be 970 with one zero zero two we are
with invariance at this point that'll
kill one same story the improvement is
clear from Windows Update but there's no
clear improvement from throwing an EFI
update on there as well using the new
features sure but not standalone the
story continues for synthetic tests and
for other
Gamze benchmarked it's really not
interesting at all so we're going to
move on but basically what we have so
far is a potential improvement from
either Windows updates or game updates
in battlefield one and total war
Warhammer the other games did not have
updates as stated Windows updates and
the forced game updates are most
important in those two titles the f1 in
total war Warhammer
the others are largely insignificant
differences for the most part and it
appears that the games right now at
least these to be f1 and Total War are
around where performance was when SMT
was disabled in our original review so
that's looking better though you can
still disable SMT with these new updates
and get better performance in stock the
difference between those numbers is not
as great in these two police in the
Total War title which had the biggest
difference overall the ceiling itself
though doesn't look higher with the
29:33 mega it's memory or 2666 on the
1700 so let's move on to memory
overclocking to see if there are real
gains so a few notes here if you're not
familiar with memory overclocking on
Rison or Intel memory overclocking and
timing tuning right now is not
necessarily trivial with Rison with the
newest efi updates it is certainly
easier but the process isn't as simple
as if you're used to an Intel platform
flipping an accent piece which going to
a frequency dialer and increasing it and
hoping that it will probably work as
long as you don't go too crazy it's not
that simple with Rison right now what we
had to do was memory training so we step
through memory frequency improvements
incrementally one for the next
established stability and then did the
next set of updates and increments after
sorting through six kits of memory and
spending about an entire day on this
task we found that our Trident z30 200
megahertz CL 14 kit seems to work the
best right now and that is because it
has Samsung B dies where the other kits
like the HyperX kits which largely use
hynek's thighs generally have issues
with overclocking or even achieving
their stock capable frequencies as
advertised on the sticks with Rison and
riding 7 and the motherboards that we
have including gigabyte and Asus and
this is something that we've talked
about previously
so B dyes are where to go for Samsung
from Samsung
for these memory kits if you want to
achieve a higher clock you need to start
there g.skill has a lot of them that are
known to be bend as di specifically
we've also since requested an even
higher bin of memory from g.skill so
should have further updates on this
front for you soon but for today we got
stuck around 34 66 megahertz and we're
awaiting additional shipment from G
scale to push further so thanks to EFI
updates direct support from build Zoid
and acs and support from g skill we were
able to walk through the six or so hours
of memory training required and tune in
to establish a stable overclock of 34 66
megahertz with CL 14 timings we were
able to hit thirty six hundred megahertz
and tried pretty damn hard to stay there
but it just wasn't stable for actual
load usage with the hardware that we
have available apparently and we'll have
to try other CPUs and other memory kids
going forward a lot of tuning is
figuring out whether your are seven
chips respond better to reference clock
tuning or memory multiplier tuning and
then going from there figuring out if
you want to operate from a base of 24
26.6 6 or 32 X for the multiplier in the
memory this is mostly a guess and check
game which takes the majority of the
time required after you've established
those baselines for reference clock and
memory multipliers you should be able to
get a stable OC that will run without
any issues we're using the 1700 X for
this since all the most recent tests
were conducted on that chip and because
I had a 29 33 megahertz base for all of
those tests making it very easy to do
the comparison the 1700 as stated was a
lower frequency for the non overclocked
tests that we did and hire for the
overclocked ones making it less linear
to compare will have these synthetic and
rendering benchmark results in the
article below as stated previously and
we'll just go through gaming now
starting again with Metro last light the
34 66 megahertz 1700 X with stock clock
sees a performance bump from 123 to 125
FPS average with lows effectively
identical around 81% and around 50 10.1%
that's an improvement of about 1.6
percent by going from 29 33 to 34 66
megahertz with the Windows updates and
the EFI update in
along with the memory overclock so we've
seen about a 1.6 percent gain here
looking next to court overclock and we
see the 1700 X at 3.9 gigahertz with 34
66 megahertz memory is placing around
129 FPS average or roughly 1.9 percent
ahead of the 1700 x @ 3.9 gigahertz with
29 33 my guards memory the change being
only in the memory compared to the
original results which had be 693 and 29
33 on the 3 point 9 gigahertz overclock
we have moved up about 2.4 percent from
120 5.7 FPS average to 120 8.7 FPS
average you might as well add these into
the original tables as well for
comparison note that the Intel series
and the 1800 X haven't been retested
with the new Windows or game updates so
anything which impacts Rison could
theoretically also impact Intel or the
800 X we haven't yet determined to this
on this table we're seeing our best
effort 1,700 exit line item with a core
3.9 gigahertz OC and memory 34 66
megahertz OC finding around where the
original reviews are 7 1700 4 gigahertz
OC with SMT disabled landed we are below
the i7 4790k stock CPU which sits at
1:30 6.7 FPS average with the 1% at
worst frame times converting to an FPS
of 101 and 0.1% worst 294 FPS the 7700 K
modern flagship is at 146 FPS average
with 104 and 95 1/4 70.1% loads
representing the frame time the 1700 X
with its memory OC and core over clocks
run at 88 FPS average of 1% low and 56
FPS average at 0.1% close disabling SMT
as illustrated by previous tests
improves frame times in this particular
title back to GTA 5 to the next one here
we're seeing our 1700 X at 3.9 gigahertz
with 3466 mega its memory performing at
around 135 FPS average with an
improvement in frame times over base the
1700 X at 3.9 gigahertz with 29 33
megahertz memory is that around 128 FPS
average is showing an improvement of
about 5.7 percent by overclocking the
memory 234 66 megahertz if we kill the
core OC removing the core OC and just
run the memory OC we're at roughly the
same place 120
an FPS average with lows around 80
versus a stock 1700 X with 29 33
megahertz memory the 3.9 gigahertz
version with 34 66 megahertz memory
improves performance by about 11 percent
again that's by overclocking memory and
core to compare it to a simplified stack
that puts the 135 FPS 1700 X above the
1,800 X when it was overclocked with
builds at 693 or the 1800 X's best-case
in other words it is also below the
iPhone 4790k and averages and frame
times which leads by about 4.4 percent
average the overclocked i7 7700 K is
next to be compared to the overclocked
1700 X the 7700 K is similar in price to
the 1700 and for pure gaming builds it
should be alongside the 1704
head-to-head comparisons keep in mind
also that the 1700 can support the same
overclock and memory overclock as our
compared 1700 X which means performance
is identical at the same clock the 7700
K overclocked is at 1:51 FPS average
with 101 and 93 fps lows at 7700 K still
therefore holds a performance lead of
about eleven point nine percent which is
down from its previous performance lead
of 18.9% so there is improvement here
that said we have not yet retested the
7700 K with build 970 of Windows 10 or
with memory overclocking of its own and
the 7700 K here is at a 32 hundred
megahertz CL 16 memory clock and timings
and watchdogs to the stock 1700 X with
34 66 megahertz memory places at 100 FPS
average with lows in the 70s and 60s vs.
the 1700 X stock with 29 33 megahertz
memory this is a significant improvement
of 19 percent so far all of our
improvements in the same comparison have
been in the single digit percentages
making watchdogs to a bit of an
interesting title we also know that
watchdog 2 is particularly thread
intensive and previously published a
video and article studying the CPU
impact from different settings in the
game and so there could be some sort of
cross CCX traffic that benefits from the
faster memory in this case well you can
have the 3.9 gigahertz 1700 X at 29 33
we're faced with an average FPS of about
87 which previously showed no note where
the improvement over the stock 1700 X
with 29 33 megahertz memory memory is
clearly choking rising in this specific
title and looking against Intel the 7700
K overclocked lands at 114 FPS average
at 91% low frame times and 76 0.1% blows
the 1700 X with core memory OC lands at
107 average 75 1% low and 60fps 0.1%
lows again we'd have to overclock
Intel's memory for final validation of
this title but this gives an IDs where
aizen's memory overclocking performance
lands back to battlefield one it appears
that the most important item is the B
970 Windows Update and or update the
battlefield one since previous testing
after which point overclocking becomes
less significant the 1702 x with its 3.9
gigahertz OC and 3466 memory posted no
significant statistical difference
versus the 7200 X at 3.9 gigahertz with
29 33 megahertz memory the difference
here is effectively zero percent
battlefield 1 like watchdogs 2 has its
own unique performance needs looking at
the stock 1700 x vs the stock 1700 x @
3466 my cards memory so the memory is o
seed we also see an effective equal
average frame rate I'll be it with
improvements to the 0.1% level metrics
from 86 to 90 5 fps back on the bigger
charts with the other tests and CPUs
this lambs the new 1700 X metrics around
the I 560 600 K at 137 FPS average 89 at
1% low and 77 0.1% low is where the 17
100x has a lead in frame x over the i-5
but is around the same in averages
versus the nearest i7 the 1700 X is
again under the i7 4790k which is at 140
FPS average for the next chart again we
haven't updated Ashes yet because that's
not the point of this test ashes appears
to care about memory overclocked more
than core overclocked in this test
configuration the 1700 X at 3.9
gigahertz 34 66 megahertz memory places
at about 41 FPS average just ahead of
the 39 FPS average of the stock 1700 X
with 34 66 megahertz memory the latter
of the two with its 39 FPS average post
an improvement over the stock 1700
with 2933 records memory of 18.8% versus
our best of be 693 metrics this is
another title that seems to make use of
the gains again we haven't rerun Intel
yet or overclock its memory so mileage
may vary until we get those results in
but comparatively these 1700 X is now
price competitive with the 7700 K in
this title as the 7700 K is running 43
FPS average with its core overclocked or
42 without we're curious to see if a
memory OC benefits kb lake in this
particular game if we were to spend the
same amount of time working on that but
for now the 1700 X with all of our
overclocking effort is starting to claw
back some ground finally we have total
war Warhammer again keep in mind that
this game it just receives a patch and
we haven't yet rerun the other tests
including Intel or FX benchmarks for the
r7 1700 X overclocked in memory 234 66
megahertz with a stock 1700 X provides a
performance boost to 160 FPS average and
1 24 fps 1% lows this is up from the
stock 1700 actual 29 33 megahertz memory
at 145 average for performance
improvement of roughly nine point nine
percent versus D 2.9 gigahertz 17 Ardex
229 33 megahertz of memory and B 970
Windows we see an improvement of about
five point one percent the core OC and
memory OC puts is up to 165 FPS average
for a gain of about eight point eight
percent over the overclocked 1700 X with
29 33 megahertz memory and now test it
against the other items on the chart the
7700 K overclock that lands at 187 FPS
average with the stock 7700 K at 186 FPS
average it is possible that we're
bumping up against other limits here
given the proximity of performance
between these two line items the
overclocked I 570 600 K runs at 177 FPS
average with poorer frame times compared
to the 7700 K more similar to the stock
1700 X and it's best white with all the
over clocks the 1700 axle ends and the
ahead of the 6600 ki 5 and behind at the
7600 ki 5 and averages the lows are
ahead at 1:12 there's a lot more to do
as always but we'll leave that here for
now there's ton of data to sift through
and for
today that gives us a baseline at least
for improvements from more effort in
overclock and then might be normal for
these types of benchmarks my thanks to
our team for helping Patrick spent the
better part of a day really establishing
a stable memory in core overclock on the
1,700 acts with all these changes and
Andrew will undoubtedly be spending a
long time editing this video with all
the charts after the overclocking effort
note here that we did have to keep the
crack in X 62 on there that cooler was
needed to ensure that these 1700 X did
not encounter thermal throttles when
testing because in our original review
we showed that it is possible the
thermal throttle that CPU if you're
using a worse cooler and you're blasting
voltages to try and sustain higher
clocks or something like that or just
generally if there's more traffic on the
cores between T C X's or otherwise just
in general more traffic you might have
thermal problems so we threw a cooler on
there to ensure that was not a concern
we do that with all these tests unless
we're testing thermals and there's more
thermal testing coming soon though so
I'll leave that for that future content
for now we've got you the updated FPS
numbers we have you the data to sift
through it's been provided look forward
to future testing there's synthetics in
the article linked below thank you for
watching as always you can go to
patreon.com/crashcourse as' if you'd
like to help us out directly and
purchase us something like a bot that
automatically reads through these
scripts and edits the videos I'm sure
that's possible right with the patreon
money we have otherwise subscribe for
more thanks for watching I'll see you
all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
