donna and today we are reviewing the
corsair strafe mechanical keyboard this
is the non RGB version of the strafe
there's an RGB version coming out
shortly in theory this month will see
the release of that new keyboard and we
don't have a yet but we will have it for
review in very short order before moving
on to the RGB strafe we're looking at
the normal strafe which is backlit but
not red green blue just read so you've
got one color and that one color is
adjustable in four different brightness
levels including off so if you got three
different levels of on and then off
which is similar to the thermaltake or
TT eSports Poseidon Z that we reviewed
maybe around a year ago maybe a little
bit less we like that keyboard well
enough so now we're looking at this one
which is a cherry MX keyboard and the
strafe uses Cherry MX red or cherry MX
brown switches so those are your two
switch types for our review we had the
red switches and the brown switches are
found in the in the logitech g7 10-plus
which we've previously looked at the g7
10 plus does something a little bit
different they dampen the impact of the
brown switch by adding a rubber o-ring
on the underside of the key cap this is
technically outside of the spec of
cherries switch design but that's what
Logitech decided to do and it makes the
brown switch a little bit quieter in the
corsair strafe it's just red and brown
no damping going on in the background
and then in terms of other core features
there is a USB pass-through present so
you've got two USB lines coming out of
the keyboard one is for power and one is
for data and those connect into the rear
i/o of your system of course or wherever
else you want to put them if you do not
want the pass-through to be active you
can just elect not to connect the data
channel and that saves us one of your
USB ports in the back of the case in the
range of other specs the keyboard has
140 roll over it's got media keys that
are usable only through the function
plus f row keys so you push FN and an F
key to use the play/pause and
for back keys for your media control and
then it's got a two year warranty
included with the strafe keyboard
Corsairs new strafe keyboard is priced
at 110 dollars and that's what it's
currently available for on amazon and
other retailers so it's sort of a
competitive price point with actually
course there's own product the k70
vengeance line keyboard and then cougars
products which are priced in the 100
dollar price range the stray falls in
between those and the strife is marketed
as a semi discreet but still kind of
flashy keyboard so it's got that slight
gamer aesthetic but it's not going
overboard like we've seen with some of
the other peripherals out there on the
market not naming names on that but I'm
sure you've all seen what I'm talking
about the Corsair strafe uses a mix of
metal and plastic for its build
construction and the metal primarily
comes in the form of the metal back
plate which is somewhat brilliantly
painted red and the reason this is
important is because the back plate is
somewhat exposed this is a coarser
design that they do on the Vengeance
line as well not a lot of other keyboard
manufacturers do this most of them will
hide most of the internals if not all of
the internals with a plastic top coating
but if you want that somewhat exposed or
more raw look then the strafe follows on
with other corsair products and semi
exposes the metal back plate and the
reason it's painted red is because the
switch for cherries LEDs in this case
just a normal Cherry MX red switch with
an LED placed in it is not the new
cherry MX RGB LED switch and that switch
positions its LED differently from the
normal MX red the way it's different is
the MX red and MX brown as you'll find
in the strafe keyboard that we're
reviewing here they position the LED in
the top and back of the switch so that
means that because of the way the keys
are oriented it's going to cast a shadow
downward on the front of the key cap
this shadow is mitigated by the use of a
red painted back plate so that helps
provide the appearance that there is a
more full spread of the red LED across
the surface of the key
word and in terms of light spread we can
also talk about the general illumination
vibrance and the light bleed all three
very important things in the case of
keyboards the light bleed on the strafe
is not that bad actually most of it is
pretty tight to the key caps themselves
and shines through the legend the legend
on the key caps is as you would expect
absent from paint so all the light
shines through the legend the letter
basically on the key cap and the key
caps are made of ABS plastic from what
we can tell anyway so they are plastic
key caps but they do feel pretty good
and that's something that Michael Kern's
talks about more in the full review
which you'll find links in the
description below I mean attention
briefly to something else there's
something in keyboards mechanical
keyboards primarily called key
chattering and that's when the sprain in
the switch in this case MX Reds or MX
Browns produces a raining noise upon
being pressed and that's either from
bottoming out or just being pressed kind
of hard or being used in succession
rapidly with many other keys
simultaneously in action Sookie
chattering makes a ringing noise it's
pretty faint but it is audible
especially if you're a fast typer and
depending on what type of switch you're
using in the case of course there's a
strafe keyboard we did not find any
chattering present in the keys and
that's a good thing that means that the
design has accounted for this and
eliminated it effectively at least to
the point where we can't hear it during
use the corsair strafe uses the MX
switches across the entire keyboard and
the exception of one instance where the
top right buttons use rubber domes and
those buttons are four basic controls so
your windows lock and that means they're
not going to be used frequently so we
can kind of get away with not using the
MX switches in that instance because as
a user you're not really going to care
but other keys include the stabilized
keys so any large key like the spacebar
were shift or enter those will generally
be stabilized especially in a mechanical
keyboard and that is done with a variety
of means but the primary one is a metal
bar that goes underneath the key cap and
helps stabilize the input so that it's
more uniformly dispersing your force
when you press down on the key
in the case of the strafe the spacebar
and other stabilized key is still
actuate linearly so they don't feel that
different from pressing the regular MX
red switch keys of normal size which is
a good thing one thing we did want to
complain about with the strafe was its
bottom row of keys is a non standard
size this means that if you're the type
of person who likes to bling out your
keyboard with a whole bunch of different
keys or a key cap set like you can buy
online different types of key caps for
different games you're going to have
issues with the bottom row where the
size is non-standard so do keep that in
mind pulling apart the strafe reveals
that a panasonic 32 181 controller is
used for the lighting which is the same
controller as used in the RGB k-series
corsair keyboards the strafe only uses
one of these where the RGB boards use
two so that's the one primary difference
and then looking further we see an nxp
11u 37 m 501 processor is used as the
primary input controller on the device
internal build quality is definitely
proven as high by way of clean soldering
and Walmart construction and well laid
out components and high quality
components so this is something that we
can stand behind as a high quality build
and say firmly that courser has done
well with we awarded the corsair strafe
with our high build quality and editors
choice awards for its high built quality
and general usefulness in the world of
mechanical keyboards which is sort of
flooded right now with low quality
components and with oddly priced
components and with a huge move toward
RGB and that's not the state coarser
isn't moving toward RGB further because
they're doing it with the strafe but
they're still used for single color
keyboards not everyone wants to spend
150 + 170 hundred eighty and so on on
RGB keyboard so in that case the strafe
is a welcomed addition to the world of
mechanical keyboards and at its price
110 dollars it's really primarily
competing with coursers Vengeance k70 at
120 dollars and the cougar 700 k at
around a hundred dollars there are other
keyboards in that range of course rose
Wells got some of the
for instance and thermal takes got there
TT esports poseidon keyboards with the
RGB one shipping very shortly and those
are worth considering as well but the
strafe really is in a class of its own
in terms of build quality until you
start looking at higher end stuff like
in the 110 plus 120 130 range we think
that the lighting for the strafe
keyboard is vibrant it's uniformly
dispersed and the red painted metal back
plate is actually pretty brilliant so in
all those instances definitely a big
plus for coarser the cue software we had
a few small bugs with but nothing major
nothing that was inhibiting to use and
could all be pretty much worked around
or averted and in terms of the queue
software is actual support its
functionality the macro programming and
the light programming and level
monitoring and stuff like that it all
works pretty well it's just some of the
basic UI that we had bugs with on for
example laptop screen but you're not
going to be encountering that use case
to regularly anyway overall the corsair
strafe is something that we think is
worth buying and if you want to read
more about the actual science behind the
mechanical keyboards and the mechanical
keyboard market check the link in the
description below to go to Michael
Kern's article on gamers Nexus net and
check out our specs dictionary which you
can find on Gary's nexus donna as well
in the main menu item and that will tell
you all about hysteresis and key chatter
and key caps and actuation pressure and
all that stuff definitely cool learn if
you like this kind of content hit the
patreon link in the post roll video that
will roll right after my face gets off
the screen and see if you are maybe
interested in supporting us we've had a
few supporters pick up lately and we are
hugely thankful to you and of course
we'll continue to push good content so
thanks again for all the support and for
watching the video the strafe is worth
looking at but there's plenty of other
options that we're reviewing in short
order as well so stick around for those
and I will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
