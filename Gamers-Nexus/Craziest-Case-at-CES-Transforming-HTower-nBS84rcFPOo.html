dotnet and we're at in wins booth at CES
2016 with the h tower which is a pretty
sweet frame as you'll see momentarily
all the CES coverage is brought to you
by I way powers revolt to gaming PC so
the H tower opens its like a transformer
it's been called the transformer case
and it will actually open and close on
servo arms or something similar to that
so there's actually you can see it
opening now I'm in the danger zone here
there's an actuator on the bottom and
that's sort of like a piston or a ram
and that comes up or down in the socket
in the bottom and that's what controls
the opening and closing action the board
will rotate fully horizontally once it's
completely open and then it can close
back up as normally so this system was
assembled by BS mods their mod shop
based in the Washington area we've done
a lot of videos with them too great at
what they do and this red in when logo
on the top was one of these small
additions but other than that anyone
basically said leave this thing as is
because it's limited right now anyway
and expensive and it is pretty cool as
is so this thing is twenty four hundred
dollars MSRP you can pre-order it now I
don't know if anyone's going to actually
do that but the 2400 MSRP weight is
somewhere in the range of 80 pounds
there's no really hard number no one's
weighted somewhere in 80 pound area
mostly aluminum if not all aluminum and
then you can see the normal components
here with the Aurora liquid if anyone's
curious what that is that's what it is
it's Mayhem's Aurora liquid and the
enclosure itself is one of a few of in
wins higher end attraction models so
they have this vision vision series they
do to get people into the booth and
cycle them and that is what this is not
really meant for mainstream users quite
obviously but very cool technology and
we have a couple other cases we're going
to be showing off it will do a separate
video for that so check that in the
channel linked down there and of course
article the article will also be linked
in the description below do you want
that information thank you for watching
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
