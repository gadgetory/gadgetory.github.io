hardware news recap leading into
Computex so we have a lot of news coming
up in just about a week or now but
there's still more to talk about today
leading news item us because we did
10,000 points and fire strike with this
thing next to me and we have a live
stream archive if you want to catch that
but spoiler alert again we end up
scoring ten thousand nine points with
the whole unit lots of fun thank you for
joining us from I do recap later so
that's a cool news item but other than
that China is meeting with micron over
DRAM pricing yikes and AMD B 450 chipset
specs jpr has a quarter 1 2018 GPU
report that we've talked about a bit but
we have more information on it and a
couple of new product announcements that
we'll go through as well before that
this video is brought to you by Corsairs
IQ software update which finally bridges
at Q peripheral software with elements
of Corsair link IQ takes a major step
forward for game integration bridging
RGB LED illumination with in-game
effects in Far Cry 5 and supports course
there's an entire product ecosystem with
a single software solution download IQ
at the link in the description below so
again for a quick recap on this thing we
end up basically putting a custom water
cooler on a Haiti's Canyon Nook it's the
in town I am the combination unit
overclocked it pretty high we hit 48 64
megahertz or so 48 80 in that range and
on the GPU we were at fourteen hundred
megahertz very good for that thing and
we even changed out the power brick for
a laptop one that was slightly more
powerful just to get that extra Headroom
and then the other news item quickly is
that the 3d laser engraved cubes we have
the glass tear down crystals are now in
stock and shipping and the mod matte is
in stock in shipping so I'll keep it
short but basically the point is if you
buy it it's shipping now as opposed to
being a backorder like previously first
major news item China meeting with
micron / DRAM pricing so at this point
the upward Ram pricing is really no
surprise to anyone talks about it a lot
but it seems the command everyone's
attention and perhaps most attentive is
China and China has good reason the
government that is to be attentive
that's because China is the world's
largest consumer of DRAM and memory
consuming
about 25 20 % of DRAM supply and 25
percent of global NAND supply quite a
lot all over the world that is the one
of the larger actually is the largest
consumer of DRAM and to that effect
China's anti-monopoly Bureau has met
with micron regarding DRAM price trends
and there are little details on the
meeting but we can mostly just read
between the lines from how this meeting
comes after a similar meeting with
Samsung another major memory supplier
and a looming class-action lawsuit
that's currently in complaint status but
we should have response from the
defendant soon that be hynek's Samsung
and micron are the defendants in this
one so between all those things
revolving our DRAM pricing it's looking
like there's some actual investigation
going on on potential collusion of
memory prices right now China is meeting
with Samsung is said to have potential
increased production impacts with the
Samsung memory supply and microns
meeting with the Chinese government
agencies might bear similar results
where the prices mysteriously go down
and the supply mysteriously starts going
up China hasn't pointed their gaze at SK
Hynix yet as far as were publicly aware
but given the current climate we can
expect the Chinese government to do that
sooner rather than later so we'll see
this is a very interesting story to look
at just a quick reminder the class
action filed in the u.s. is still a
complaint
there's nothing proven so the defendants
have a chance to respond basically
paragraph by paragraph to that class
action complaint and it's coming up on
their deadline at this point so we
should know seeing what they say but
eventually it may go somewhere and if it
goes somewhere that's when we'll start
looking into whether there was actually
price fixing or not even if some of it
was just very interesting coincidence
next news item AMD's b force 50 chipset
specs have been spoiled so Andy is
readying the successor to there be 350
mid-range chipset and EB 450 chipset no
surprise is late its released in the
second half of this year B 450 will
support 2000 series CPUs out of the box
one of the major upgrades and by upgrade
I mean they flashed BIOS
and it will also retain an overclocking
sport as be 350 did previously and then
finally it's got the same amount of USB
so I'm out of SATA 10 on a PCIe
connectivity as the be 350 predecessor
so nothing's really changed there but
the idle power draw of the chipset is
less than 2 watts so that's gone down a
bit and for actual meaningful changes
memory support should be a bit better on
p450 just like it was with export 70
that was the main change for 70 where's
370 no real difference in terms of i/o
support or HS i/o lanes or anything like
that you'd expect the chipset just
changes with the memory support which
falls more on the motherboard tuning
than the literal chipset but given that
motherboard vendors are focusing more on
new chips that's not old ones they're
gonna have better memory support for the
new stuff so before if these should
follow that line with x4 70 also before
50 will support nvme trade which was
previously exclusive to x3 99 pretty
small use case there but those are the
differences we know right now for the
specs with p450 next one john petty
research and the first quarter 2018 GPU
report we talked about this a bit a
couple weeks ago in a news item but
there's some more to discuss here so the
latest report from jpr suggests that the
crypto mining market has finally become
saturated suggesting that miners wanting
cards have gotten them the report
indicates that cryptocurrency mining is
still influencing the PC graphics market
but that influence is waning and gamer
interest is allegedly increasing so
here's where it gets a bit interesting
the GPU shipment rate we talked about
this previously is up
66% annually with over three million
Adam board cards shipped to miners in
2017 another 1.7 million shipped in the
quarter and we previously talked about
and videos results for the last quarter
the most recent quarter as well where
they had some of their own mining
numbers I think about 300 million in
mining revenue directly logged jpr
forecasts that due to the mining
fizzling out at least for the time being
gamers are seen supply increase and
prices hopefully coming a bit down which
will actually talking about that in the
hardware news at the end of this episode
JP are also expects that gamer interest
will be strong in quarter two and
assuming it all as well and that should
offset the normal quarter to seasonal
decline
this is good news for gamers and PC bill
there's an other side of the mic market
as long as JP RS prognosticating holds
true of course all it takes is a random
unforeseen spike in various currency
values to find ourselves again in
another mining boom but it's looking
okay right now next up Arctic has
announced their first a.m. for passive
CPU cooler called the Alpine Am for
presumably intended to be used with a.m.
these ap use most likely the cooler can
be used with any a.m. for AMD CPU and
with a TDP of no more than 46 watts so
this means that users could use CPUs
from a.m. these 1000 or 2000 series that
have TDP set to obviously 4 at 46 or
lower the Alpine am4 should be
relatively simple to install it comes
with 4 Springs and screws pretty
straightforward stuff and mx2 thermal
compound pre-applied nothing special
there either there's a six year warranty
to round out the features notably I mean
it's it's a piece of metal so not with
as much secure on with it pricing isn't
final but as we've seen online it
shouldn't be more than 20 dollars and
more likely will be about 15 potentially
good fit for the low power components
maybe some of the low end low low and ap
use next also in in cooler company news
typically cryo rig has a new frostbitten
dot 2 SSD cooler so Krier ik intends to
unveil this m2 SSD cooler at Computex
again coming up in about a week we'll be
there and it's dubbed the frost bit m2
SSD cooler the new cooler will feature a
dual heat pipe design attached to a
small fin stack that is pivotable as to
remain outside of GPU and add and board
clearances for PCIe slots the thermal
suggestion for the heat frost but m2 is
12 watts and will require a degree of
airflow over the fin array obviously to
actually do anything to get rid of the
heat but it'll still at least spread it
nobody tails out and pricing an
availability but expect more in about a
week at Computex quick note here for m2
SSD well actually for any SSD flash
memories in and actually does not like
being cold when you're using it actively
it's better for the Nan's life for its
lifespan and
and for it to be warmer when it is
inactive and stored you want it cold
hence the name cold storage but when
it's active it's actually better for it
to be warmer than colder so if you were
actually chilling it actively you'd be
killing your flash memory with something
like this it probably doesn't matter a
whole lot what you really want to cool
is the controller not the memory this is
kind of a solution that will definitely
cool the controller and the memory but
unless it's I mean unless you're
basically ambience or below below
ambient for the most part you don't have
much to worry about for endurance just
keep it in mind that cooler flash is not
actually better unlike most other
components but a cooler controller is a
next one micron and QL scene and SSDs
have been in the news bit so micron
revealed they're shipping their new ion
SSD lineup and this is going to be for
specific customers and partners microns
at new 52:10 ion SSDs are among the
first to offer qlc NAND and will offer
capacities up to seven point six eight
terabytes and a two and a half inch form
factor the SSDs are slated for full
release in the fall and are headed to
the data center segment as is usually
the case with leading-edge storage
technologies the storage technology will
eventually come down to the consumer
market as micron has made evidence ql'
seen and stores four bits per cell and
uses sixteen voltage states it's a feat
that ultimately reduces NAND endurance
but pays off in storage capacity if
you're curious about how this works in
general how NAND works what mlct LCS LCR
are those things we have a video on it
you can just search the channel for how
flash NAND works or something like that
just search for NAND flash you'll find
it so yeah sixteen voltage states and
microns one terabyte qlc or 128
gigabytes for the die provides 33% more
density than their previous mlc die and
this can theoretically allow micron to
construct nand packages using fewer dies
and still offer increasing storage
capacities microns new SSDs are offer
the latest enterprise safety features
like power loss protection data path
protection 5-year warranties and in turn
rade features and microns ql so you can
withstand 1000 PE cycles not a whole lot
but it's what you get with capacity and
offers a 1 d WP d or drive right per day
is the metric of endurance for the
present ql scene and is intended to be
used for read intensive enterprise
storage and endurance is not a paramount
concern for that implementation and
related to this micron and intel are
delivering the first 4-bit Pursell ql c
memory dies so this is the same use as
in those SSDs we just talked about it's
part of the joint memory venture from
Intel and micron who have delivered the
first 64 layer 1 terabyte ql scene and i
as previously mentioned this is a memory
that's used in microns newest SATA based
52:10 enterprises d while Intel hasn't
yet announced any products using a ql c
you can be sure they're going to that's
probably why they're working with them
potentially at Computex or FMS the flash
memory summit in august for that one
this one this one feels personal mg XT
is launching the H 700 D D for dumb so
there's no more actually technically
they didn't call that
but we've been calling it the H 700d
since week reveal age 700 I and that was
actually stolen from a patreon backer
but basically deep for dumb meaning they
took out the smart device so just a it's
trivial news item NZXT is relaunching
their age 700 h 208 400 cases without
the smart device at lower prices this is
something that we strongly agree with so
the H 700 I as a reminder we actually
really likes we gave it an award in our
end of year roundup of cases and like
the build quality a lot airflow is okay
it's certainly manageable build quality
is very good though and they do a few
unique things with a design the downside
was that the smart device wasn't at the
launch particularly smart and it
definitely cost a lot you paid for that
thing so now they've aged 709 I which we
always wanted and that's $150 a steep
reduction definitely worth picking up
because the case overall is good it was
just overpriced that smart device lage
400 is now $100 200 is now $90 we can
strongly recommend the H 700 here having
it worth to the 400 and 200 too much
though but same idea overall
and the design is again unique it's got
you color accents could build the
quality there's just that smart device
was really holding it back so glad to
see that and we have a review on the H
700 I if you're curious about it just
ignore everything about the eye and
you'll get the idea for the Aged 700 and
then final news item before hardware
news for the week apex game it was a
relatively new case maker from last year
actually has announced a new case called
the ex Mars the ex Mars enclosure has
taken the exmark Asian to new levels the
apex gaming X Mars has an ex plastered
across the front and center of the case
behind which rests a dust filter and at
least three fans renders of the case
show it as equipped with upwards of 10
fans with three mounted near the PSU
shroud three on Drive cages one in the
rear and three in the front certainly
looks interesting but it's price is
terrifying the ex Mars a full tower will
be available for $1000 the company also
noted that there's an ex Mars junior
probably the worst possible suffix you
could throw on a case available for $190
if we put two interior shots side by
side of the ex Mars next Mars junior
you'll see the differences they
primarily exists in embellishments holes
dotting the drive cages and power supply
shroud and overall size and then finally
hardware news we saw an EVGA CLC 280
which is one of the better closed-loop
liquid coolers on the market if you want
one of those mark down to one hundred
and ten dollars so that's a good price
for that actually very competitive with
other 280s on the market especially the
more RGB happy ones that tend to be up
towards 150 so we like that cooler for
that price the msi 1070 TI duke is also
available for 470 f3 mates roughly 492
payout if you like looking at Amazon our
new egg and will link both of those in
the description below if you want to
pick one of them up 1070 ti4 474 9 he's
actually basically MSRP so related into
the j PR news item
sounds like the prices might be somewhat
normalizing that's a reasonable price to
pay for 1070 TI so really happy to see
some return to normalcy for the pc
market that's it for this one subscribe
to make sure you catch all the copy text
coverage we'll be there in a couple of
days the show doesn't start till next
week but we're getting there early to do
some factory tours so subscribe so you
can catch those
and as always go to patreon.com/scishow
stops that directly or store that gamers
nexus dotnet to pick up one of our mod
mats or the 3d laser engraved logo cubes
which are now both of these items
shipping not on backorder anymore thanks
for watching I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
