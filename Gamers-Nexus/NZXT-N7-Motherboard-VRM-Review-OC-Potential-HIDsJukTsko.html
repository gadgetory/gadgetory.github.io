hardcore overclocking here today we're
taking a look at a new entry into the
motherboard market the NZXT and 7z 370
so ya NZXT now apparently designs
motherboards because obviously they
don't actually have a motherboard
manufacturing plant but they can
certainly design a motherboard so this
thing is mostly targeted at having like
RGB controls and fan headers and
aesthetics which are all things I
honestly don't care about or know very
much about and quite frankly they're
mostly subjective so it's like we're not
going to address those what we're here
to check up is what I'm here for is to
check that the VRMs are up to scratch
and that NZXT hasn't just sacrificed all
of the all of the you know vrm quality
to the aesthetics gods so let's get
right into that before that this video
is brought to you by EVGA and their GTX
10 ATT is c2 video card with icx
technology the 1080 is c2 has a nine
thermal sensor spread across the board
which allows you to easily check the
cooling performance of the vram the vrm
power components and the GPU this makes
for better noise to performance tuning
in software and you can learn more about
the sc2 at the link in the description
below basically all of the VR M's and it
on this board are look while all the big
ones there's obviously minor voltage you
know there's various other voltage
regulators scattered around the board
for like the chipset and while VPP which
is somewhere here quite possibly that
thing there's you know some various
minor rails scattered around the board
but the main ones the important ones are
all located right around the CPU socket
in this great big l-shaped block and
this is actually four different VRMs so
this portion right here that is the eye
GPU so I'm just gonna call that V GPU
next to that we find the V Corps and the
V Corps ends right around here because
under that we find the VCC essay and the
VCC i/o so that's your system agent
power
and your memory controller power so
that's all the VRMs they're controlled
by this chip and that chip this chip up
here is a ir35 2:01 this chip down here
is a 3 5 2 0 4 actually I can put that
right on the board against there's space
down here
ir 3 5 2 0 for this thing supports up to
4 phase output at 2 megahertz switching
frequency not that that's actually a
useful switching frequency because most
MOSFETs even after like a doubling
scheme that this is gonna be like 1
megahertz which is way too high for most
MOSFETs especially if you want any
amount of vrm efficiency admittedly this
board is actually using this like pretty
modern power mod like dual and fats that
are well vela actually these are really
modern because there's no public data
sheet for some of these at right now so
these are actually optimized for 500
kilohertz so there is progress in the
power of power you know power transistor
industry we're going steadily higher and
higher switching frequencies on these
things as they get more and more
optimized similar to CPUs and more
gigahertz over time but anyway so 3 5 2
0 4 down here for phases two megahertz
not that that is useful yet and this is
a eight phase also 2 megahertz maximum
switching frequency so let's get into
the details of the biggest well the core
and V V GPU shared the ir35 to 0 for 2 0
1 here so I can't address with one
without addressing the other so in terms
of set up the V chord vrm looks like a 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 phase but that is an 8
phase voltage controller and it's also
doing the GPU so this is using a
doubling scheme so that is a 4 x 2 on
that part and indeed that's exactly what
we see because we have four of these
chips behind the
behind the actual MOSFETs and those are
International rectifier ir35 98 sidenote
International rectifier is now owned by
Infineon who actually makes the MOSFETs
that this board well some of the MOSFETs
that this board uses so the ir35 98 now
these cause a bit of a problem with the
vgpu because I'm not sure if that's a
tube that if that's two phases getting
doubled or if that's for phase is true
because these are doublers and or dual
drivers which basically means that they
can either double or they can well they
always act as a driver right but you
have kind of multiple options of how you
can achieve the driver outputs so
basically you can feed two PWM signals
into one of these and then you've got
two driver outputs without any doubling
or you can feed one PWM signal into it
and then you get a doubled up and then
it basically acts as a doubler that also
does a driver duty for two phases which
means the IGP portion could be a plus
four or it could be a plus two times two
I'm really not sure which it is because
of these being what they are and the
board also being located on the other
side of the Atlantic Ocean and I'm only
having pictures either way the IGP uvr
like if you're buying this motherboard
which costs uh I think right now it's
supposed to be two hundred and fifty
dollars MSRP if you're using the IGP if
you're using an eye GPU with this
motherboard you've done something really
wrong in like your build planning phase
I'm like sorry but no like that's
ridiculous
so you know I'm alternately not that
concerned about the eye GPU VR I'm here
because it's not all that useful for
most people anyway the vcore vrm is a
doubled up for phase which is obviously
significantly better than just having a
straight four phase it's not as good as
if you had an eight you could argue it's
around while depending on how its
configured you can actually get it to
almost the same performance as an
Faye's but uh generally speaking it's
better to have a true eight phase
ultimately four times two is really
really popular on a lot of motherboards
I don't really have any like huge
complaints about this especially for a
motherboard that doesn't even target
overclocking like this thing is really
supposed to look good first and then be
a motherboard second so you know that
that's fine in my book the actual
MOSFETs used for this thing are really
nice so as I said before they're made by
Infineon and these are BS g 0 8 1 2 ND
power blocks dual n fats basically they
integrate the high side and the low side
MOSFET into one convenient package their
rates it for a maximum current output of
50 amps assuming you can call them and
you can't exceed that because the
packaging for the MOSFETs would actually
well it would fail
basically the connections between the
silicon that is actually used to make
the MOSFETs and the motherboard and the
the actual ceramic top and the pins on
the the packaging those connections
aren't built to survive more than 50
amps so basically these are limited to
that 50 amps current output like that
that's a hard limit you can't exceed
that well if you throw enough cooling it
just about anything you can exceed the
max rating but generally speaking if you
go over 50 amps on these they're gonna
have serious problems with it in terms
of actual specs I can't give you hard
data because I don't actually have data
sheets for this specific MOSFET however
there are public data sheets for the
zero eight one one and the zero eight
one three and talking to a contact that
does have access to the price you know
the non-public datasheet for these I
know for a fact that it's right in
between a zero eight one one and a zero
eight one three in terms of specs so
yeah if you're interested in reading the
data sheets just read these two and then
you know scale everything down to
halfway in between that's the deal with
with the BSG zero eight one two
nonetheless these are you know that
these are high in power blocks like 50
amps is a very high current out but most
of the time you well unlike Z to 70 40
amp was standard and even like x3 70 40
amp power blocks are pretty standard so
50 amps is a it's a pretty good upgrade
over like the last generation of
motherboards we've seen and the end
result is that even on coffee like which
is a pretty power hungry platform for a
5.1 gigahertz overclock right 5.1
gigahertz which is achievable for daily
if you have a good enough chip and at
one point for 2 volts which produces
about 200 watts of power consumption
which also means you're going to be
pushing about 140 amps out of the v
corps vrm the vrm will actually only
produce about 12 watts of heat on the
MOSFETs which really isn't that much as
long as NZXT has a halfway decent
heatsink on top of this but I'm not you
know I have a photo Steve's gonna test
if the if the cooling system on this
motherboard is actually a adequate so
you can look forward to that you should
subscribe to see that and yeah so and
obviously that 12 well that 12 watts of
heat dissipation that's at 500 kilohertz
switching frequency and 5 volts gate
drive so you know pretty standard
parameters for a VR on it might actually
be running a higher drive voltage
because the 3598 and even these power
blocks they support much higher drive
voltages like 10 volts or even 12 volts
but uh since I'm not sure what NZXT is
actually using I'm just gonna use the
lowest one because that one will give
you the worst efficiency and that way I
can't overshoe if the VR like the VR M
could be better but it certainly
shouldn't be any worse than what I've
just written down now for a much more
reasonable overclock probably the kind
of overclock that somebody with this
motherboard would end up at 4.8
gigahertz and
about 1.3 volts you'll be looking at
about 120 amps output and about a
hundred and 60 wait nope 155 watts of
power consumption and for that the vrm
will actually produce only about 7.5
watts of heat so that's that's really
kind of nothing very very little heat
output at that point and the arm should
have no problem handling that so you
know if you're just doing some moderate
overclocking this motherboard really
shouldn't let you down and even if you
really want to push it it should be fine
unless the unless the you know the
aesthetics focus got in the way of the
cooling capabilities of the vrm heatsink
which again like the you need test data
for that I can't tell you but in terms
of actual MOSFET selection there I have
no complaints for the V core of the RM
now moving onto the GPU vrm that's oh
and incidentally all of these power
figures those are for an 8700 K because
that's the power hungriest CPU you can
get for coffee like at this point in
time now for the eye GPU you get a some
kind of for phase it might be doubled it
might not be doubled I'm not entirely
sure Intel specs that the a GPU vrm has
to provide up to 45 amps of current they
do not specify a voltage so I just took
an educated guess at at one point one
volts and at that kind of current and
you know voltage output same switching
frequency and drive voltage the four
phase for the IGP you will produce about
three watts of heat so on the off chance
that you don't have a GPU but do have a
250 dollar motherboard your eye GPU is
gonna have you know the v arm for the AI
GPU is plenty overkill don't have to
worry about that finally moving on to
the VCCS a and the VCC i/o which are the
really like these these are really minor
V RMS they do barely any work VCC essay
by Intel spec is 1.0 5 volts and 11 amps
and if you're overclocking that will
probably like if you're really hammering
the memory overclock so you know the
board doesn't officially support DDR
4000 or any speed above 30 866 so you
won't you shouldn't need a high V CCSA
but there is a small chance that even
for lower speeds just because the
motherboard has a work like is
performing worse in memory overclocking
in general you might need more vc CSA to
stabilize lower speeds nonetheless the
maximum voltage you would ever really
want to go to for VC CSA is maybe 1.3 5
volts at one point 4 volts all could
also be fine but really if you want your
memory controller working in a year or
two you want to stay away from one point
4 volts so at one point three five volts
you'd be looking at maybe 15 amps
current output for the VCCS a rail and
that's maximum not like constant just
maxed out and for that for well for 11
amps you're gonna be looking at about 1
watt of heat output for 15 amps about
1.5 watts of heat output oh oops
read my notes wrong 1.5 Watts for 11 and
2.3 Watts ish for 15 amps so again you
know nothing there's really no concern
here really the biggest concern is gonna
be if like you're really pushing the CPU
core clock the vcore vrm might get all
if the heatsink is inadequate the VCC IO
rale it's a single-phase and well that's
normally expect at 0.95 volts from Intel
and about 6 amps output which is nothing
and the well if you're overclocking it
you might end up at you know 1.3 5 volts
again same same restrictions apply as on
VC CSA you don't want to go anywhere
like 1 point 4 volts won't kill the chip
instantly but going to 1 point 4 or over
1.4 for extended periods of time is a
pretty bad idea so at one point 3 5 you
might be looking at about 9 amps of
current through the VCC i/o rail
and you know four six amps one water
heat output and nine amps you're gonna
be looking at about 1.5 watts of heat
output and I've just remembered that I
forgot to mention who makes the MOSFETs
for these these three while the MOSFETs
for VCC sa and vc cio and the actual
memory vrm are all the same they're dual
n fats they're from C no power and these
are s m7 340s
they don't have a maximum current spec
but they're they're actually like in
terms of like on resistance these are
actually really good very low RDS on but
they're pretty slow they switch rather
slowly they have pretty high input
capacitances especially the low side fat
on one of these is absolutely snail
speed so the end result is that well
that's why the it's used for minor rails
it's not a like it's not really a great
mosfet for for anything major but then
again that's why it's used for VCC sa
and vc cio because using these power
blocks using the Infineon power blocks
would be just massively overkill I mean
even these are massively overkill this
is barely any eat so yeah
no complaints for me for you know NZXT
Zeus of MOSFETs there and the memory
ddr4 very power efficient you know four
sticks you might be a little while four
sticks one point three five volts you
might be looking at about eight watts of
heat output which is nothing and that
also at one point three five volts
that's about six amps and yeah at that
kind of current draw that vrm will only
produce about one watt of heat kind of
similar to the VCC i/o situation right
there so yeah I have I have really no
complaints in terms of MOSFET selection
and voltage controller selection though
I don't know what the controller for
memory power for memory is but like
again ddr4 is just so easy to power like
there
memory power has never ever been a like
major issue on a ddr4 motherboard in
terms of memory overclocking the main
issues come in the memory trace layout
which basically you need testing you
need to test if the bond the board is
good at memory overclocking or not
because unless NZXT sends you there you
know motherboard schematics you're not
going to be able to tell if the the
trace layout they have is good and also
the BIOS you know a bad BIOS can
absolutely ruin memory overclocking very
very quickly and n ZX ety does only
expect this board for ddr4 you know 238
66 megahertz so yeah I wouldn't expect
great things in terms of memory
overclocking out of this board but again
it's targeting being a fan hub and an
RGB controller and some aesthetics
things not you know breaking World
Records so I don't really have issues
with with like I don't obviously as an
overclocker I'd like to see it like like
to see better memory overclocking
support but as far as the V arms are
concerned NZXT hasn't like done any like
they they've not done any huge mistakes
like there's nothing like the vcore v RM
is solid I GP use overkill ECC sa and vc
cio are overkill the memory power is
overkill there's like no complaints from
me in terms of uh V RMS the BIOS might
need work maybe the trace layout for
memory might need work but uh physically
the board is sound and the last thing to
address because people have been
recently kind of interested in this all
of the capacitors on the board while all
of the Aleut well all of the aluminum
polymers on the motherboard so all of
these cam types I'm not sure what the
audio section capacitors are but all of
the cam types the black ones those are
they're not Nicci cons which is an easy
mistake to make because I know a lot of
motherboard manufacturers you know they
have black colored mid-cheek on FPC
use capacitors but the coloring of a
capacitor is something you can literally
just like ask the company to do for you
all the capacitors here are a pack and
that's uh that's a Taiwanese capped
manufacturer they're extremely popular
on motherboards under the $200 mark so
especially like if you buy low on
motherboards you probably have these and
yeah these are rated the ones on this
board are rated for 5000 hours 105
degrees centigrade and they're aluminum
polymers so you know bog-standard
mid-range capacitor basically no
complaints from me there either so yeah
that's that there's not really much to
this board because it doesn't target
overclocking that hard but it is a solid
entry you know it's the the BIOS I I
don't know I've not seen the BIOS but as
far as the the hardware is concerned
NZXT hasn't done anything
horrific ly wrong so that's it for the
