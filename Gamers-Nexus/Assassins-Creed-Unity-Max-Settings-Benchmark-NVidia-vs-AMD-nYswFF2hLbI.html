nexus donna and i just got finished
benchmarking Assassin's Creed unity it's
been a long night tested the game with
most the GPUs that are modern we use the
GTX 980 of course got a couple seven 80s
and they're 780ti 290x all that stuff so
I tested the game's performance with
various GPUs at various game settings
including max settings some Nvidia
specific settings and then medium and
low with the objective being to
determine what video card is best to
play Assassin's Creed unity now
Assassin's Creed unity we've already
viewed it hit the channel link below and
you can see Nick Pinkertons review of
the game but this is just looking at
performance ACU has very high quality
graphics very high fidelity uses Nvidia
game works including shadow works Nvidia
partnered with Ubisoft to debug and
develop the graphics within the game so
they are pretty hi-fi graphics which
means that you're going to need a higher
quality video card and we did run into
some optimization issues on lower
platform lower end platforms so that is
a concern in terms of graphics
technology before we get to the
benchmark charts ACU introduces a few
cool things first of all it has some of
the most advanced npc crowd programming
we've ever seen that is very graphically
demanding especially because you're
rendering obviously all the items
they're wearing things like soft body
physics apply to the cloth and the
movement and that's another thing the
physics it's not quite as crazy as Lords
of the Fallen where you have individual
particle effects with physical
interactions as the character passes
through fog for instance it's not quite
that crazy but there are definitely the
usual soft body cloth and flag movement
in the wind or through as the character
passes through things like that there's
a bombardment of lighting technologies
of course there's H Bao which is in an
ambient occlusion technology HBA o plus
and then a soft ayo technology is in
there as well for the lower end products
and
is basically just how the light
interacts with how shading and might
interact with objects especially where
they are overlapping one another so a
good example of this would be leaves and
foliage on the ground where the light is
hitting this leaf or foliage and it's
got all these contours that it's trying
to sort of saturate with the appropriate
opacity shadows so that is sort of the
overview of a 0 and then other than that
there's p CSS which is percentage what
is its percentage closer soft shadows
it's an Nvidia and AMD technology works
on both video cards and it was
definitely optimized for NVIDIA in the
development of the game but they smooth
out the shadows quite a lot when they're
casts on the ground or on dynamic
objects it basically makes a shadow less
sharp less harsh so it appears more like
a real shadow because a shadow is not a
physical item in the world so it's it's
generally not going to be perfectly
smooth on all sides beyond that there's
txam saai explain both of these in the
article link to the description below
hit that if you're curious with that
tessellation is not currently in
Assassin's Creed unity but it's getting
there and we will test it as soon as
it's there tessellation is basically the
act of taking a smooth surface that is
textured like a brick wall that's just
flat with a texture on it and making
those bricks look like they're
individually modeled so rather than
texturing it looks actually individually
modeled in terms of the game's
performance it really it eats a lot of
video ram i tested that and saw that it
tends to consume 3.2 to 3.5 gigabytes of
video ram if that much is available to
it and it uses about 2.1 2.2 gigabytes
of system memory and with that noted
video cards that are in the one to two
gigabyte range do suffer quite
tremendously in the performance of this
because ACU wants all the video RAM they
can get its hands on up to about 4
gigabytes max the full test methodology
is linked in the description below in
that article but let's just go through
the charge really quickly on ultra high
I only tested the mid-range to high-end
cards and the GTX 980
barely get 60 FPS is just below 60 FPS
and that's sort of what we define as
playable now in actually play in the
game with a nine-day 980 i had no
trouble at the 50 to 60 FPS range it
sits in but it's certainly not perfect
and part of this is optimization part of
it is because ACU has insane graphics
and insane amounts of objects drawn on
the screen at a time which is a lot of
draw calls being made to the GPU and
even the CPU the 780 ti pushes about 51
FPS so a slight decrease but not huge
the 290x is at 50 FPS this is still
slightly playable but probably needs
some tweaks looking at the GTX 770 we we
hit unplayable levels along with the
270x so the 270x the 770 and the 280 x
or 280 are all sort of borderline with
ultra-high you're going to need to drop
down to medium in medium settings in
most cases the GTX 970 if you're curious
where that is it falls about the same
spot as the GTX 780 maybe slightly above
it in performance so that would make the
the 970 really the best value out of all
these top playable performing cards GTX
770 performs really surprisingly poorly
with ultra high so you will have to drop
down to lower settings on high we see
that the 770 is still just below 40 FPS
not really the best so you end up
needing to run a medium high hybrid with
high settings on AC you look at medium
settings we've got finally a 50 FPS a
stable with the 770 and dropping a a
completely will push that to around 60
or higher depending on where you are in
the game how much is going on the 980
and 780ti lose their gains it's not a
linear gain here so that is an
optimization issue on the software side
of things and then the game is still
unplayable on cards that are in the sub
one fifty dollar budget range including
the 270x so dropping down to low we
finally see that the 270x enters the
playable range for a see you at around
50 FPS which is really pretty staggering
because normally a video card like the
270x or 750 ti will play everything
pretty fine at medium and high settings
in this case they barely do it on low so
that kind of shows you where your your
money is going if you're building a
system for playing assassins creed unity
and you will probably need to do some
custom tweaking at the 1080p resolutions
or whatever if you're playing on 1080
you'll definitely need to lower some of
your graphics settings if you're running
these mid-range card and that is all for
this benchmark check the link in the
description below for more information
and I will see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
