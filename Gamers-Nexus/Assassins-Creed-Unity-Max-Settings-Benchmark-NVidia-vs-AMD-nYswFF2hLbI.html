Nexus Tana and I just got finished
benchmarking Assassin's Creed unity it's
been a long night tested the game with
most the GPUs that are modern we use the
GTX 980 of course got a couple 780 s and
their 780 Ti 290x all that stuff so I
tested the game's performance with
various GPUs at various game settings
including max settings some Nvidia
specific settings and then medium and
low with the objective being to
determine what video card is best to
play Assassin's Creed unity now
Assassin's Creed unity we've already
viewed it hit the channel link below and
you can see Nick Pinkertons review of
the game but this is just looking at
performance ACU has very high quality
graphics very high fidelity uses Nvidia
game works including shadow works Nvidia
partnered with Ubisoft to debug and
develop the graphics within the game so
they are pretty high Fi graphics which
means that you're gonna need a higher
quality video card and we did run into
some optimization issues on lower
platform lower end platforms so that is
a concern in terms of graphics
technology before we get to the
benchmark charts ACU introduces a few
cool things first of all it has some of
the most advanced NPC crowd programming
we've ever seen that is very graphically
demanding especially because you're
rendering obviously all the items
they're wearing things like soft body
physics apply to the cloth and the
movement and that's another thing the
physics it's not quite as crazy as Lords
of the Fallen where you have individual
particle effects with physical
interactions as the character passes
through fog for instance it's not quite
that crazy but there are definitely the
usual soft body cloth and flag movement
and the wind or if through as the
character passes through things like
that there's a bombardment of lighting
technologies of course there's HPA o
which is an an ambient occlusion
technology HPA o plus and then a soft AO
technology is in there as well for the
lower end products and
is basically just how the light
interacts with house shading and light
interact with objects especially where
they are overlapping one another so a
good example of this would be leaves and
foliage on the ground
where the light is hitting this leaf or
foliage and it's got all these contours
that it's trying to sort of saturate
with the appropriate opacity shadows so
that is sort of the overview of AO and
then other than that there's P CSS which
is percentage
what is its percentage closer soft
shadows it's an Nvidia and AMD
technology works on both video cards and
it was definitely optimized for NVIDIA
in the development of the game but they
smooth out the shadows quite a lot when
their casts on the ground or on dynamic
objects it basically makes a shadow less
sharp less harsh so it appears more like
a real shadow because a shadow is not a
physical item in the world so it's it's
generally not going to be perfectly
smooth on all sides beyond that there's
TxAA MSAA I explain both of these in the
article links the description below hit
that if you're curious with that
tessellation is not currently in
Assassin's Creed unity but it's getting
there and we will test it as soon as
it's there tessellation is basically the
act of taking a smooth surface that is
textured like a brick wall that's just
flat with a texture on it and making
those bricks look like they're
individually modelled so rather than
just texturing it looks actually
individually modeled in terms of the
game's performance it really it's a lot
of video RAM I tested that and saw that
it tends to consume 3.2 to 3.5 gigabyte
it's a video RAM if that much is
available to it and it uses about 2.1
2.2 gigabytes of system memory and with
that noted video cards that are in the 1
to 2 gigabyte range do suffer quite
tremendously in the performance of this
because ACU wants all the video RAM they
can get its hands on up to about 4
gigabytes max the full test methodology
is linked in the description below in
that article but let's just go through
the charts really quickly on ultra high
I only tested the mid-range to high-end
cards and the GTX 980
get 60fps is just below 60fps and that's
sort of what we define as playable now
and actually play in the game with a
ninety nine eighty I had no trouble at
the 50 to 60 FPS range it's it's in but
it's certainly not perfect and part of
this is optimization part of it is
because the ACU has insane graphics and
insane amounts of objects drawn on the
screen at a time which is a lot of draw
calls being made to the GPU and even the
CPU the 780ti pushes about 51 FPS so a
slight decrease but not huge the 290x is
at 50 FPS this is still slightly
playable but probably needs some tweaks
looking at the GTX 770 we we hit on
playable levels along with the 270x so
the 270x
the 770 and the 280 XR 280 are all sort
of borderline with ultra high you're
gonna need to drop down to medium in
medium settings in most cases the GTX
970 if you're curious where that is it
falls about the same spot as the GTX 780
may be slightly above it in performance
so that would make the the 970 really
the best value out of all these top
playable performing cards GTX 770
performs really surprisingly poorly with
ultra high so you will have to drop down
to lower settings on high we see that
the 770 is still just below 40 fps not
really the best so you end up needing to
run a medium high hybrid with high
settings on AC you look at medium
settings we've got finally a 50 fps a
stable with the 770 and dropping a a
completely will push that to around 60
or higher depending on where you are in
the game how much is going on the 980
and 780ti lose their gains it's not a
linear gain here so that is an
optimization issue on the software side
of things and then the game is still
unplayable on cards that are in the sub
150 dollar budget range including the
270x so dropping that into low we
finally see that the 270x enters the
playable range for ACU at around 50 FPS
which is really pretty staggering
because normally a video card like the
270 X or 750 Ti will play everything
pretty fine at medium and high settings
in this case they barely do it on low so
that kind of shows you where your your
money is going if you're building a
system for a plane the Assassin's Creed
unity and you will probably need to do
some custom tweaking at the 1080p
resolutions or whatever if you're
playing on 1080 you'll definitely need
to lower some of your graphics settings
if you're running these mid-range cards
and that is all for this benchmark check
the link in the description below for
more information and I will see you all
next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
