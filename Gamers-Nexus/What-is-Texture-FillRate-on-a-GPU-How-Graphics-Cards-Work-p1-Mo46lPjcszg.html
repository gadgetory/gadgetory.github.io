next astana and today we're talking
about texture fill rates or texture
filtering this is part of my efforts to
define all of the GPU terminology that
you run into when looking at new video
cards and this is something I already
wrote about you can hit the link in the
annotations or description below if
you're interested in learning more about
texture fill rate for video purposes
we're gonna look at the TM use very
briefly the texture filtrate and more
depth and then the core clock and how
all three of these elements relate so
when you're looking at say a gtx 980 and
i'm using this only because i know the
specs off the top of my head at gtx 980
has a TMU count of 128 a core clock of
11 26 megahertz and a texture filter
array or fill rate of 144 point 1 Giga
cycles per second so these are the
numbers were interested in so the filter
rate represents how many texels per
second the GPU is capable of applying
colors to of applying maps to of
applying filtration processes to like
bilinear trilinear at anisotropic
filtering and its measured in Gigot
axles per second so you've seen these
settings in games before whether or not
you understand them there's bilinear
filtering try linear and nice and
anisotropic and those filtering
technologies effectively look at how an
object is being drawn on your screen
relative to the camera so you might not
have an oblique view of an object an
object might be like the floor in front
of me or imagine a road in a racing game
it's not an oblique angle to the camera
it's an odd angle and it scales off into
the distance like a vanishing point
so what anisotropic filtering will do is
help take something like the dots on the
road that the lines the dotted lines and
it will make sure that they they vanish
into the distance in a smoother and more
realistic sense without any filtering
process at all in the old days what
would happen is the texture would
stretch because it's being applied to a
square space rather than something like
a trapezoidal space which makes more
sense when you've got a road going like
like that into the distance so the
texture fill rate is what is being
saturated when you're applying these
technologies
like anisotropic filtering it's also
being saturated just when you're
coloring a Texel because on the screen
you've got several different objects
you've got tons of different textures
being drawn to each object and the video
card needs to determine what color each
individual dot on the screen should be
at any given time based on your
movements based on the camera angle
based on lighting and shadows and all of
this stuff and that's where we need a
big pipe so at one forty four point one
gig at Axel's per second that's one
hundred and forty four billion texels
per second that the GPU can process this
sounds like a huge number and it is but
it's maybe not quite so huge as you
would think because you need to take
into account that we're processing
texels every second 60 times per second
for an average of 60 fps which is sort
of what we need as a playable framerate
so if you've got a 4k screen just
pretend for a second you've got a 4k
screen that means you have 8.3 million
pixels on your screen and that's a lot
of pixels so the GPU it needs to draw
these 60 times per second if you want a
60fps and it needs to apply filters to
them and it's drawing off-screen pixels
for other technologies so suddenly
you're at 8.3 million times 60 which is
approaching 500 billion texels or so per
second that's a lot it's not 144 billion
which is what our number is but it's
still a lot and then you've got to apply
a technology like anisotropic filtering
for X for example so now you're
filtering it four times and you're up to
2 billion texels per second and then we
can draw off-screen objects this is new
ish and gaming and that lets say off
pretend off my camera there's a tower
and it and below me there's a pool the
pool is reflecting that tower and I can
see the pool on my screen and I can see
the reflection of the tower on the
screen the GPU is taking these texels
it's taking these textures it's taking
all this data of the tower and it's
applying it to the pool in front of me
so it's drawing an off-screen object on
screen and a reflection that consumed
yet more of our pipe and that's why we
need such a large pipe still you're
basically never gonna approach anywhere
close to 140 four billion texels per
second even with the highest on games
because you're gonna hit other
bottlenecks before you get there and
games just don't push that kind of
throughput not yet anyway and these are
things we said ten years ago when one
Giga taxol seemed impossibly high but we
surpassed that still though even in the
worst case load scenario you're pushing
one to four billion texels it's not even
you know not even close to 144 but that
is what texture fill rate is and it is
calculated by taking the count of
texture mapping units multiplied by the
core clock of the GPU and then that
gives you texture fill rate so in the
case of a GTX 980 you've got 128 units
times eleven twenty six megahertz
megahertz and that is a measurement over
time and then that gives you 144 Gigot
axles per second because you can see the
math on the screen that's how it does it
so that's where TM use are relevant and
each texture mapping unit is capable of
processing one texel per purge cycle
basically so you've got eleven twenty
six megahertz those are cycles of the
GPU and each TM you can process one
texel so that's why it's 128 times the
clock the core clock in the old days
this wasn't always true in the view due
to technology there were two texture
mapping units which was a big deal and
they weren't always as good as just
strictly to texture my opinions because
they had a rule each unit had to work on
the same Texel or pixel at any given
time so even though you've got two units
they need to work on the same Texel and
if the Texel only has one texture
applied to it that means only one unit
has a job to do the other one it's like
hiring too many people to do the same
job now in these days dual texturing was
becoming a thing so there were often
multiple textures applied to a single
point in space where things are
overlapping so then each unit could
function on the same taxol because each
unit is processing a different texture
but it just goes to
that the marketed rate or one 44.1 Gigot
axles in this modern instance is not
always representative of a real-world
use case and this is also true with AMD
where you've got a different amount of
floating-point TM use from integer TM
use so in a game that uses
floating-point you've actually got fewer
TM usable to you than in something some
encoding the rendering task that uses
integer units which will way outperform
the FP unit so as far as texture fill
rate and whether it's relevant the
answer is yes with hesitation because
all the texels on your screen which is
every single 3d dot in space that has a
texture applied to it needs to be
filtered because the GPU needs to
determine what color it should be needs
to determine what sort of filtering is
being applied in terms of bilinear and
isotropic whatever how many times that
taxol is being sampled that's what the
four hex means it means each Texel is
being sampled four times if you have 4x
that's a lot that's producing a lot of
load on the GPU suddenly and it samples
it four times because it's trying to be
more accurate and smoothing and
determining colors and things like that
and all these other factors so it's
important but you're never gonna
approach the numbers before you start
hitting other bottlenecks like memory
available or CPU bottlenecks or whatever
really all kinds of other bada life's
first that doesn't mean it's unimportant
it just means that as gamers we don't
utilize that pipes so heavily so that is
texture fill rate and how TM use and
core clock and everything to relate
again link in the description below for
the full article it might be a bit
easier to follow with on this video
because there are a lot of numbers and
sometimes it's hard to follow on a video

want to support these videos and upgrade
the lighting or help get us to
conventions or improve camera equipment
check the patreon page it will help a
