Nexus we've got a new chassis review for
you today this is the NZXT switch 810
this is a full tower case designed for
the high-performance gamer or the
moderate enthusiasts out there it runs
for about 170 to 180 dollars and is
available in a few colors including this
matte black edition that we'll have a
look at today you'll see that there's a
lot of dust management and cooling
options as well as an intricate cable
management system alright let's have a
look
one of the most impressive aspects about
the switch 810 is the airflow it starts
from the front and continues all the way
through the case you'll see this little
event here the bottom right and then
behind the front bezel ok press down and
you get access to a dust filter
unfortunately though you can't remove
the filter until you actually unscrew it
first so takes a little while it's a
little bit of a hassle for dust
management but it's still an effective
tool the switch 810 has 4 140 millimeter
fans by default including this rear 140
this top 140 and the front 140 we just
saw a second ago the internal fan that
comes by default is one that you can
angle see if I can do this there we go
you can angle it as much as 15 degrees
to cool your VGA and this fans lot down
here supports that feature on top here
you'll notice this really cool
ventilation feature you can just simply
pull this tab here and that way you'll
have better airflow so keep this open
for games or a benchmarking program or
you can keep it closed for a more quiet
operation and then all you got to do is
push down and voila here you have the
interior of the top and that could
accommodate anything is advanced as a
360 or 4 20 millimeter radiator at the
back of the case you have nine expansion
slots accommodating three or four
graphics cards depending on what kind of
video cards you use I really like how
these are ventilated so that you have a
maximized airflow but unfortunately the
threading for the screws is so tight
that you actually have to use a
screwdriver to tighten your video cards
into place rather than just using your
thumbs you also see for water cooling
grommets right here which is excellent
if you have a custom water cooling setup
so that way if you're building with a
lot of hardware you can keep the
internal appearance of your system
looking pretty neat
there are two bottom filters with this
case a front and a rear all you have to
do is come around here push down on the
front front filter comes out and same
thing from behind it push down and this
filter comes out as well okay one of the
other convenience gripes I have is when
it comes to removing the front bezel you
actually have to remove the bottom
filter first if you remove the bezel
before the filter then that's going to
take the filter with it and the filter
can bend or something bad could happen
and you don't want that so let me show
you how to properly remove the bezel by
first removing the filter filter comes
first
then the bezel and then the vice versa
or the other way around put the bells
alarm first things good there and then
slide the filter in and everything is
okay
no matter how many hard drives or
graphics cards or liquid cooling hoses
that you have in your system cable
management and the switch 810 is not
going to be a problem at all part of
that is because you have 10 grommeted
cable routing holes and a few other
places to put cable you have
approximately 23 millimeters or 0.9
inches of cable management space to work
with which is a fairly good amount cable
management will also be easier because
this fan power hub the spots right here
are taken up by the default fans but you
do have three vacant connections as well
as a vacant molex connection
okay let's look at the IO features like
I do to access the IO is sort of press
and lift you have two USB 2.0 ports two
USB 3.1 internal connector an SD card
slot very nice audio in app a reset
button right here and a tiny little
white LED toggle there is a white LED at
the back of the case power button is
just right up here
if your motherboard supports ahci you
can use the hot swappable hard drive bay
right here just simply pull to remove
the drive a cover and extract the tray
and your hard drive or your two and a
half drive can go in there and then once
you you know install it push it in what
not you have the SATA hub right here
which will help finish the job and keep
your hard drives nice and convenient
aside from the hot swappable hard drive
bay that we saw earlier there are two
removable hard drive cages each of which
supports three three and a half inch or
two and a half inch drives to install
drive all you got to do is remove the
tray and then place it on their secure
it in place depending on three and a
half inch or two and half inch and then
you just slide it back in there I like
how it loads from the mother the behind
the motherboard tray instead of in the
front that way that makes cable
management a little bit easier and if
you like you can remove one of the drive
cages and therefore accommodate a longer
graphics card or just have a little bit
more room to work with
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
