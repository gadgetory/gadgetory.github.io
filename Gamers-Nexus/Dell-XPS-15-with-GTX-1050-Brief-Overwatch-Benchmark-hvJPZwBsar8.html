the GTX 1050 laptops I have two of them
here from Dell they are the Dell XPS 15
we're at the Nvidia suite I don't
actually have a meeting with Dell but
we're gonna be talking about these the
specs in a very brief sort of tertiary
benchmark of the overwatch settings on
ultra so we'll be talking about that if
we're getting to that this content is
brought to you by cyber power and their
cyber XL gaming PC which comes equipped
with an invertible motherboard tray that
they set up for you link in the
description below for more information
on that so there are three main
benchmarks that I do on these types of
laptops and overwatch is generally the
third one in the bench we like to run
GTA 5 and things like that as well but
the 1050 as it is presented here really
only has this one title setup on it for
us to work with at the suite so we've
got overwatch it is the least intensive
game that I generally work with laptops
but I can give you a baseline and we can
throw a chart on the screen of my
benchmarks from overwatch with the
actual desktop 1050 and see how the
numbers compare going over the basics
first the specs the Dell XPS 15 here in
front of me has the i7 7700 HQ version
of Intel's KB Lake processors and that
is a higher-end SKU but it's an HQ model
not an HK model so it's not unlocked for
overclocking the 1050 however you can
overclock through normal means you can
use your own tools afterburner precision
things like that and the vendors so
that'd be MSI Dell any of the other
CyberPower they have their own ability
to overclock and then sell it with an
advertised higher clock rate so they've
got some room to play in there to
differentiate themselves depending on
the thermal solution and thermal
solution for these because their laptops
really dictates everything you'll see
different performance from one to the
next even with the same GPU just because
of the thermal solution and this is a
pretty light and thin laptop so of
course that's a limit your ability to
breathe all the ventilation is on the
bottom not gonna want to put this on a
blanket or something but you've got your
ventilation on the bottom I'm not sure
how many fans are in here we
opened it or anything like that I don't
have the right tools to do that it's got
star head screws but in terms of the
basics 15 inch screen same i7 I said the
GTX 1050 desktop version is basically in
the notebooks there are some differences
so clock rate for example and CUDA core
account can be changed between desktop
and notebook depending on how and video
wants to tune for performance versus
temperature in a small form-factor and
in this case I believe it's 642 decors
and then the clock rate of this one is
some around 13 54 megahertz base and
we'll have bass and boost on the website
if you haven't seen that coverage
already for the very basic band shark
this is not scientific I don't have my
normal tools with me maybe look at it
more later but the basics using
overwatch is built in frame rate
analysis tools and using ultra settings
with 100% render resolution at I don't
even what think about 1080p on this
display yeah 1080p ultra settings we're
getting somewhere around 57 280 FPS in
the training benchmark course we
normally run that's a big range so when
you average it the numbers should look
pretty close to about 59 to 60 ish and
we'll have to benchmark that again with
real tools but that's unpretty confident
in that being the landing-place so not
bad for 1080 with ultra settings on a
gtx 1050 in a notebook with an i7 of
course helping it out a bit overwatch is
not the most intensive game in the world
but that gives you a baseline for
comparison against the desktop parts if
you're curious about that of course you
have to control for the CPU and things
but talk about that more later so that's
that's what I have for you on the Dell
XPS 15 we'll look up price things like
that and throw it in the article which
you can find linked in the description
below that will be our gtx 950 news
announcement written by patrick Lathan
so check that out thank you for watching
as always pay john linka postal video
subscribe for more content i'll see you
all next time
