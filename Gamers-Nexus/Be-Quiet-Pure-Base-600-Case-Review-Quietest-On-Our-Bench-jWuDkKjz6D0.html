fills a stout form-factor using a
structure that shrinks as much as
possible while still supporting standard
orientation ATX motherboards this new
$90 case focuses primarily on sound
damping and quality of materials but
misses a few points on cable management
and thermal design and we'll talk
through that in today's review of the
new be quiet pure bass 600 case the most
standout feature with this case or maybe
lack of a feature is there are no RGB
LEDs and also no tempered glass now
technically be quiet as planning a
tempered glass version that will come
out in March and it'll be $10 more but
we are going to pretend that won't exist
for now because honestly it's been
tempered glass cases non-stop for 8
months and I'm just going to cherish
this non tempered glass option for a
moment so this is a more standard case
it's back to the roots of a case what a
mid tower would be it's very simple
there is a steel structure there are
plastic panels and then it has one
feature which in this case is noise
damping aiding that noise damping as
you'll see in b-roll of the front panel
I'm sure is the fact that this has very
restrictive airflow which although not
great for thermals obviously is good for
noise emissions and controlling them so
we'll test the noise output and the
cooling performance in today's review
looking at the GPU and TV performance
when under workload that are a bit more
stressful than normally cooling isn't a
primary focus with this case clearly as
you won't be getting much air through
that front panel that we pointed out and
no air can exhaust out the top without
adjusting the height of the panel that
said the be quiet pure bass 600 uniquely
intends for its top panel to be user
configurable to fit specific needs and
stock configuration the panel is pushed
down and completely block stock exhaust
consequently blocking noise and keeping
it in for the most part you can pop the
top panel completely out which does
eliminate the purpose of the case or you
can follow be quiet to guide and elevate
it by one notch and the little clips
that exist on the underside of the panel
this grab some breathability while still
offering control over sound waves
escaping the box as for stock cooling be
quiet ships with pure bass 600 with two
pure wins two fans pre-installed in
front and rear position
the front-mounted fan is oriented by
default to split airflow between the
video card and CPU coolers maxing out
its rpm around 1200 and again there's
limited airflow capabilities behind all
these filters so for filters you can
pull the front panel off and there's a
sort of mesh that's interlocks with
another mesh which is purely a dust /
noise thing but really tight in the
front for air intake the bottom is
reserved entirely for the power supply
because it's a down facing fan to the
power supply very little height here
from the table or the surface of
whatever you put it on to the case it's
about an inch or so which is okay but
because we're only pulling air into the
power supply anyway that's kind of
irrelevant the power supply doesn't need
that much space to breathe it's not like
we have a case fan down there there's a
rear exhaust position for 120 pretty
standard technically you could mount
stuff in the top of the case but
including radiators but you would really
have to take off that top panel to get
any reasonable use out of it now you
could offset it by one notch up but as
we'll see in our thermal test it doesn't
really change a whole lot in terms of
cooling performance it would be enough
to force the air out of the case if you
had an exhaust setup but it's really
just a noise thing so that's what we've
got for cooling options not a whole lot
noise options there is foam padding on
that side panel the right the left side
panel and the front panel has just it's
closed off so now it's noise is getting
out of there anyway with regard to build
features the hard drive cages are
interesting and remind us in some ways
of an internal version of thermal takes
old level 10 case designed by BMW at a
time the cages in be quiet pure base 600
mount to the chassis by 3 screws only
suspending hdds from one side that be
the chassis mounted wall these can be
removed individually if not all are
saturated also kind of unique because
you don't have to remove entire cages
and above those there are two non
modular fixed five and a quarter inch
bays for optical drive installation or
front panels which is rarity in today's
case market with regards the ease of
installation building in this case is
similar to building in an MDF ts3 40
elites or s3 40 for that matter
or the Corsair 400 sea there are all
roughly the same size some are easier to
buildings and others like the s340 elite
which we praised for its excellent cable
management this does not have that the
ATX form factor support means that if
you do in fact install an ATX form
factor motherboard you're the bottom of
the boards can be right against the
power supply eliminating usage of some
of the cable pass-throughs and then the
right side of the board will be covering
or partially or entirely some of the
pass-through is in the middle of the
motherboard tray so that's a big issue
with the pure base 600 because of the
way the case is configured again the
primary passage for cabling end up being
in the drive cage area how though
there's one passage that's usable near
the optical drive phase and the 24-pin
power header
fortunately be quite did also get its
EPS 12-volt pass-through replacement
correct accommodating the left side and
centered placement alike this is
particularly good for motherboard that
users with additional power headers for
overclocking although that seems
unlikely given the price of this case if
you're planning to use ATX in the case
be aware again that it'll feel like the
entire thing should be about an inch
longer and maybe half an inch taller to
better route the cables the upshot of
the quiets design is that the backside
does have the usual cable tie anchors so
once you've got things managed and
routed it's not too difficult to tie
them down that said the SSD cases are
pretty tight against that side panel
wall and it's foam so do be careful that
you don't snap the SSD headers once
you've got it connected all parts of the
case both the steel and the plastic
components are fairly rugged and durable
there's an exception of the plastic top
cover which isn't stable on our review
sample when it's at its full height and
everything fits together pretty well
there were no unintentional gaps between
the side panel in the case of the good
things considered a noise focus and all
the paneling lined up for a flush fit
unlike some of the cheaper cases on the
market the quiet has impressed us in the
past with the quality of their materials
and machining as we've seen previously
with the silent based cases and the dark
base case a 600 is no exception
despite its price the top cover can
either be pressed flush to the case or
lifted one or two notches above it for
airflow but its stability at maximum
height depends on whether all the
plastic tabs
at the same angle not a huge deal since
snapping the cover down one notch locked
it in firmly but both side panels must
be removed in order to adjust this cover
kind of a pin and it can't be done on
the fly you probably wanna shut down to
do that every time this isn't like the
old Rose well-thrown or you can flip a
switch and latch them up or down we were
particularly pleased to see that the
front IO connectors and buttons are
mounted directly to the chassis and the
frame rather than the front panel so you
don't have to deal with wires and
untangling on one removing the palan
there's also less of a chance of pushing
connectors out of place of course
speaking of front i/o it only includes a
two USB 3.0 plugs and no 2.0 at all so
if you're running some older and three
platform with no USB three support then
maybe don't get this case or get an
adapter this is possibly necessary given
the size of the panel but I guess it's
more of a move forward and be quiet
trying to get away from USB 2.0 getting
into the thermal and noise testing as
always if you're curious how we do this
hit the link in description below for
the testing methodology and Patrick
Lathan's full review here and the test
and worked with the case the most so
we've got all that to find there the
very basics we're using delta T numbers
for temperatures which means that we
have a thermocouple reader that's
actively monitoring the internal
ambience of the case which is really
only used for an ambient chart and that
probe is placed sort of triangulated
between the front intake fan the CPU fan
and the GPU fan sits right there in the
middle of them now in some cases that
make temperatures look really bad like
the in one case where there's no front
intake the 805 infinity but that's where
one of them goes the other one that
monitors the environment temperature
room temperature more or less and that's
what we use for our delta T value which
again you can read about in the
description below and so something had
to be sacrificed for silence on a budget
the number one thing on that list was
airflow front intake is through two
filtered slits on either side of the
panel and that's it bottom intake is
reserved for the PSU as discussed the
cover is impractical to adjust at the
top when the system is running and so
users are forced to make a decision
between silence and cooling and
presumably you would choose silence
since you're buying a case from a
company called be quiet exclamation
point testing with the top panel open
that versus closed and with the same fan
rpm between each test we're seeing the
difference of about
1.6 Celsius load or about 4 to 5 Celsius
idle considering we're brushing against
90c territory when factoring ambiens
back in it's clear we're going to need
more than a better top ventilation to
improve thermals with our desk
configuration stock the pure base 600
outperforms in wind fanless 303 case and
a single fan 805 infinity which is
really not a particularly ringing
endorsement you could completely remove
the top cover but you'd still be limited
at the intake level and you'd then be
exiting the only use case for this
chassis which is reduced noise just a
reminder our temperature testing for
cases puts it under a worst-case
scenario so we're looking at 100% GPU
and CPU load that's not common or really
active in any type of gaming for the
most part but the test is designed to
stack cases hierarchically based on
their cooling performance only and
that's all we need to know so what we
know what we learn from that this case
is worse than the others at cooling
that's what we want to know now in terms
of real-world scenarios you probably
won't be as hot as we're seeing here
unless doing some sort of 24/7 rendering
or long render workloads where you might
have the GPU of the CPU crunching on
frames from two different directions you
wouldn't want to do that in this type of
case and then overclocking anything
where you push in a CPU to a hundred
fifty hundred 70 watts and Beyond is
definitely going to be a bit toasty in
here you might want to look elsewhere
for an enclosure this is not something
you would buy free cooling performance
you maybe would look the course there's
400 C for that similarly priced much
better at cooling but not this now in
terms of the youth cases that's all
going to be a noise which we'll get into
next and then just a quick side note
here because it is a $90 case it's more
likely that purchasers would probably be
on something like a ten sixty maybe ten
seventy Max and those are going to be a
bit cooler and some of the high-end
cards that would be more overclocked
focused and so let's take a look at
noise this is where be quite undoubtedly
specializes the pure bass 600 really
comes into its own in acoustic tests and
ideal conditions with fans turned all
the way down which you thought I
wouldn't really want to run like that
too often other than idle and with the
top cover closed the 600 is the quiet
case we've used in our current batch of
tests this is impressive if only because
it's quieter than the stock and when 303
which does not have any fans included at
all and that's entirely thanks to the
sound damping panel design of the be
quiet case which is containing the noise
of our GPUs and and our CPU fan was both
the 120 milliliter fans at the maximum
11 60 rpm and with the top cover open at
least by one notch noise it peaked at
34.2 DBA making it slightly quieter than
the NZXT s340 elite with its two 120
millimeter fans running at ten fifty rpm
it may do some future testing on how
much be quiet acoustic padding directly
affects the noise and the a/b testing
but for now it seems like it's really
doing the job its advertised to perform
the quites done well to design a case
that excels in one category being quiet
compared to nearby competition it's
clearly better in the acoustics
department if that's the thing you care
about this is a good place to start
looking
it is both visually and aurally discreet
outside really doesn't look like much of
anything it looks kind of like an old
Dell computer you might bind stuff in a
corner somewhere so that's a valid thing
to watch if you want that there you go I
guess it's there in this way it is sort
of similar to some of the fractal design
cases which are often noise focused and
discretion focused in terms of visuals
so this would be in the similar price
category for some of the fractal cases
you may want to look there for options
alternative to this in terms of cooling
again if cooling is going to be a
problem for your build don't buy this
because if you are planning to run
multi-gpu instantly you're gonna run
into problems with temperatures and with
clock rates being more limited thermally
than by anything else almost certainly
and then if you're looking at running
things like higher temperature and -
SSDs under steady state workloads pretty
uncommon for our user base but a
possibility you're going to be
generating more heat on the board and
it's going to have trouble getting rid
of that heat even though thermal
throttling on SSDs isn't that common
generally just dumping a bunch of heat
into a case like this is not exciting
because it heats everything up so those
would be the things to avoid - this case
less temperature intensive fan
are fine if you want visual and noise
discretion this is the place to look as
for competition that wasn't present in
our tests either because we don't have
it or haven't gotten to it yet we'd
recommend looking into fractal design
for alternatives in the noise space and
then we may start working on some of
their cases in the near future the
corsair q series cases like the 400 q
rather than the 400 c would also be
worth looking into as they ditch the
windowed side panel in favor of a noise
damping side panel and Silverstone's got
a couple offerings out there too though
not too many that are current even
though those competitors will have
difficulty coming close to what be quite
fun for noise at $90 this is a
reasonable buy it's really one of the
few products that we've reviewed in the
past couple months that I can actually
say the price seems fitting that's
pretty rare normally these things come
out a bit high and then the
manufacturers have stepped them down
later in this instance or this case it's
really not bad 90 bucks is pretty okay
$100 for a tempered glass version if you
wanted it I guess will exist I don't
know that I'd buy it I'd have to see
what the tent is like and things like
that but this case is really for being
quiet tempered glass you're not going to
have a whole bunch of noise escaping I
would hope depending on how they
implement it but it does just kind of
seemed like a weird combination sticking
with this is a good one tempered glass
maybe not so be quiet overall not the
sickest feel not the most robust
plastics in the world for this case but
at $90 they are fair to use if you're

enclosure you can read Patrick Levin
