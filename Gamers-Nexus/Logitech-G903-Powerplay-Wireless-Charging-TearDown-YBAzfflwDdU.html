bit different we're doing a mouse
teardown slash kind of review the theta
is Logitech sent us their power play
magnetic resonance charging mice and we
already reviewed this one this is the G
900 body now named G 903 because it's a
little bit different it supports the
power play wireless charging surface
that Logitech introduced but as far as
the actual mouse the ergonomics the
buttons the responsiveness all of that
the Wireless it's all the same in terms
of our feelings of it as the original
review and the original review was very
positive of the G 900 so if you're
curious about the mouse specifically the
903 or the 900 that content is already
on the channel you can check that review
so today we're doing a teardown we're
gonna take apart the 903 and hopefully
some of this power play charging mat
which allows for the wireless charging
through the surface of the mat transfer
it into the mouse so that's what we're
looking at and I'll talk a bit about how
it works and battery life and things
like that as we go through it before
that this coverage is brought to you by
the core G 21 enclosure from thermal
take a $70 case with 2 4 millimeter
thick tempered glass side panels and a
power supply shroud with top mounted SSD
sleds learn more at the link in the
description below so for the basics on
what this is doing we've got an
oscillating AM field it charges one coil
and then that induces current in other
coils so that would be the one between
the mouse and the charging station or
the powerplay mat that's how its
charging it uses magnetic resonance so
there's a magnetic field from the
primary coil and that radiates equally
in all directions so that primary coil
is going to end up matte as we
understand it radiating in all
directions means that it'll be the
strongest at the center of wherever that
coil is charging which is the center of
the mat and then you lose some of the
power and efficiency out towards the
edges but Logitech has built this in a
way that it's not larger than negative
charging effect unless maybe you were to
try and make it negatively charged at
the very edge and as a note digit key
has a great chart of the Chi chargers
which are used for phones and resonance
efficiency so we'll put that up and you
can check their article out on digit
keys website that shows the
and its efficiency so resonant its
downside is that it's a lot less
efficient and that's because of flux
leakage efficiency is roughly 30% at 2
centimeters in an optimal system and
this mouse is gonna be a lot closer than
2 centimeters but it basically becomes
useless once you start lifting off but
realistically you're not lifting off
more than it's using in normal use
anyway so what Logitech trades in
efficiency they make up for
inconvenience
you've ultimately got a mouse charger in
the mousepad makes a lot of sense
Corsair is trying to do one of these
pretty soon as well they were showing a
prototype at Computex but the core idea
here basically the mousepad is an extra
hundred bucks so you pay a hundred
dollars for this and then you can throw
a mousepad on top of it they provided
these as long as it's not too thick and
it's not metal it'll work in terms of
charging keeping the mouse centered is
going to be best technically it's still
charges toward the outer edges but it's
faster in the middle we don't know
exactly how much faster we don't have
this those numbers from Logitech and
charging duration so using the mouse in
testing if you're just using the mouse
on the mousepad it basically doesn't
discharge and doesn't charge as far as
you are concerned obviously the
battery's still being used and it's
still being charged it's just basically
equal rates so that's good it also tends
to stick between 80 and 95 percent by
design for battery charge when when
you're not using the mouse that's what
it'll go to and that's just because as
you burn through more charge cycles on a
battery that are more abusive the
battery dies faster so from that
standpoint it makes sense to try and
target 80 to 95 percent rather than push
really hard for the last couple percent
and heat up the battery and limit its
life which is a problem with phones as
well Android phones now have different
smart charging solutions that tend to
slow them down for the amount of charge
that goes through towards the upper
limit so we're gonna start with the
matte because I think that's the most
interesting the mouse itself will tear
down as well but those are all pretty
much the same once you get inside so
let's start the matte I think the thin
here first all maybe we can show this
you can actually see
the the whatever I guess that's probably
cabling underneath or copper wire or
something like that I'm not not an
expert on inductive or magnetic
resonance chargers so I don't know what
they consist of other than coils but you
can see the outline here so being again
not an expert in this type of thing my
guess based on just kind of looking at
this is that this is going to be the
optimal charging zone because you can
see the rectangular outline and on the
smaller one that's dead center of that
thing so that's what I'm guessing is
best for charging performance now
speaking with logitech as you get to the
edges of the pad it will charge less
efficiently and that does coincide with
what we do know of this type of charging
this isn't a new design by the way
magnetic resonance charging has been a
lie around since Nikola Tesla was alive
so it's pretty old but if you sit the
mouse out here towards the edges you
might be able to make it lose charge if
you start like using it right here with
max DPI with a one-inch movement you
could probably make it discharge faster
than it charges but that's not a real
use case so I think we were kind of
playing around with this earlier trying
to figure out how to if we needed to
slice it open or if we could just peel
it or what basically this is the module
for the powerplay charging so it's got
USB in here that needs to be plugged
into your computer that power is both
the charging circuit which just runs on
USB 2.0 spec power voltage and current
and all that same spec as USB 2 and then
it's also the wireless transmitter so
your mouse speaks with this hub directly
and then that just goes down the cable
into your computer for the actual input
and playing around earlier it looks like
this will just kind of peel and haven't
actually taken it apart yet but didn't
start peeling it there's a little plate
in there like an acrylic or
polycarbonate or something so let's just
let's peel this the rest of the way off
Logitech I'm sorry but you know that
this is what we do
we get some help from one of these just
a bunch of adhesive holding it on some
additional side notes on this if you
want to use it on a metal table or metal
service you'll want a thick layer of
something underneath it maybe another
large mousepad or something like that it
won't work on those surfaces just
because of how the charging circuit
works charging the mouse by cable is
still possible just like normally it
takes a couple hours just like normally
maybe maybe two hours or so and charging
by the mat if you were to leave the
mouse just like this it I think I don't
remember exactly I think it's something
like 12 hours 14 hours a little less
efficient if you need to use the mouse
and let it charge it probably just a
normal use takes about four days to go
from zero to relatively full and that's
during use so certainly not a fast
charging solution but it's not supposed
to be it's just supposed to be a a
sustaining solution to keep the mouse
alive while you use it so that you never
have to actively go plug it in to charge
it which they were successful in it
actually does work in that way works
pretty well a bit expensive it's bit of
a premium right now for this stuff
because it's new and you got a charge
cover R&amp;amp;D or new product but hopefully
this will trickle outward other
companies or other products later on
also this mouse pad or the power play
mat will work with anything that has
does this one have it right now so
here's a magnet that's not the charging
piece this is the charging piece so
these are basically Universal you can
take one of these from Logitech it's not
gonna work in every Mouse the mouse
needs to have the capability to work
wirelessly and with the mat but in the
future if you buy Logitech mouse with
this form factor and one of these in it
let's say a mouse that's not out yet
maybe the G 1003
you buy one of those it'll work with
this mat as well so theoretically the
mats about one time purchase but like
any company of course Logitech could
change things and maybe they decide they
want to upgrade it which point who knows
maybe it'll lose that compatibility but
for now that's just how it works the
plate that's in here might just be for
rigidity I'm thinking so here's you can
see there's your top rubber layer which
is covered again by one of these and
it's a it's really it's it's real like
rubber you're not gonna you're not gonna
move stuff around on it so that sits on
there and then underneath it we've got
what I'm calling acrylic I don't think
that's actually what it is but some kind
of clear plastic polycarbonate type
acrylic whatever material in here and
then the under rubber which just holds
it in place
let's get the top off and technically I
have to send this one back to Logitech
haha I mean I don't know if they'll have
any use for it
like I said Logitech sorry I would have
done this with the retail sample anyway
but this is some unique content other
people haven't done yet and maybe we can
learn something maybe we won't I have no
idea find out if we don't then oops
if we do that awesome there's your
outline just all a bunch of adhesive
this is basically garbage now so I'll
move that to the side is there anything
on the bottom
no okay rip rip headphone users also
rift power play mat there's power cable
let's just glue it on there huh yes
that's just glued on there all I want to
know is what's this outline I'm guessing
it's just like a copper cable like a
trace almost like I said I don't know
anything about this type of circuit so
this thing right here that's there's
your outline where's our where does the
power plug up here so where is that
exactly that's right here so how does is
it like connected right there and then
go in that's pretty cool
I don't know so this is why I don't know
like when I recoil and I'm reading about
these things is it like an inductor coil
like a choke where you've got just a
coil of a copper actual coil which would
maybe be in the powerplay module or is
it a coil like does this constitute a
coil maybe someone in the comments can
tell us if you've got an
ie background or something like that I
think this is just copper wire but I
don't actually know
so anyway eventually we come in over
here and create this circuit now I don't
think we're really gonna realistically
be able to get through this without just
using like scissors or something because
and that black adhesive is crazy strong
I don't think it'll really teach us
anything anyway is there any thunder
there if you want to look into this
thing more I don't know if this helps
you at all but we've got a part number
for the PCB right there three PC R zero
one 865 a it's probably a custom PCB I
don't know that you'll find anything out
there there's the rest of it this is
revision 0.72 so this is I should note
this is actually all is a prototype so
that's by this number might iterate to
1.0 for the retail product but either
way that's what that looks like for now
I'm not going to try and dig more into
it at the moment let's look at should we
try and get into this thing I don't know
if we were live streaming I'd ask chat
actually and I know what chat would say
chat would say yes mm-hmm okay let's
just let's peel this back and make a
judgement call if there's nothing really
under there another screws okay you know
what that's gonna be easy let's just do
that there's your power cable what's
left of it anyway the ribbon cable
nothing special in here that's just the
shell and here's your USB arm there you
go I know that name stm32 l1 series is
from st.com official source the latest
addition to st's l1 series the the one
we're looking at is the quote perfect
fit for applications that require a
minimum processing power and ultra low
power consumption at a budget price or
is there there's your LED output you can
see the diffuser plate this is kind of
cool they've got
the defuser here a little cover plate
for it so your diffuser plate cover and
I think I got on backwards but you got
the idea and then that shines through it
to the Logitech logo and where does this
hover over so this connects like that
and this part came out backwards didn't
it this goes like that I think yes that
goes there and this covers okay so
there's your LED panel I think digital
digital RGB LEDs there's a controller
that's probably capable of controlling
it and whatever else this thing does
which is basically charging and a
wireless reception I'm not sure if that
actually if that piece controls it or if
it's one of these other ones all right
let's look at let's look at the mouse
which one G 903 or G 703 I don't want to
do both and I know three is more
expensive this uh this one's 150 I think
MSRP which is what the G 900 regionally
was the G 900 is now $100 so if you like
that Mouse when we reviewed it but
didn't want to pay 150 it's a good price
now I'm still personally using the G 900
by the way I like that Mouse a lot and
this is that Mouse that's that's a
little more this is a G 403 me actually
I think you can see it in the body so
this is just the G 403 except for the
charging station this one's gonna be
much more of a pain to take apart and
recline I'm gonna get back together very
easily if at all taking mice apart
definitely inadvisable if only because
these Teflon feet you're never gonna get
them back on the way they came off it's
not gonna be a satisfying fine user
experience you can buy replacements
though and you could also do a better
job than I'm doing the earth to like
preserve them if you wanted to I mean
obviously you basically just stick it
onto like you try and pull the whole
thing off I'm like well I just split it
in half and then stick it on to a
service and just reapply it as soon as
you can and it'll be fine I've done it
before on mice that I actually used
okay so I need to actually use one of
these things right just back here that
one's salvageable yes they are captive
screws cool okay so we only had to
destroy every sticker and poly or uh
like Teflon foot on the underside but we
did get in there so it looks like is
this the battery there's your battery
lithium polymer those are kind of more
like gel packets as opposed to lithium
ion let's disconnect that all right cool
so battery's disconnected William
polymer battery for those curious if you
ever want to use their service this
thing so this is where the tear downs
become kind of useful as opposed to just
being cool if you ever want to use our
services it's really not that hard to
get into now you've seen me go through
it you know where the hidden screws are
so you don't have to destroy as much
stuff these can definitely be placed
back on there I mean some of them like
this one I did a I was more careful with
and you could put the bat back on there
and it would be basically good as new I
mean that's really not Pat so you could
do a better job that I did here and
still have a functional Mouse afterwards
and we'll have a functional Mouse just
the little sock these on a surface but
if you have to get in here to replace
the battery because your battery is
maybe you've used it for four or five
years now at this point and you don't
want to buy another one you'd rather buy
battery if you can find it the part
number
Shen's em so they're in China Shenzhen
why you one zero to nine eight - one
five zero zero four and we've got a
couple other numbers on here as well but
let's just get a let's just got a shot
of the battery and then if anyone wants
there's other numbers you can just
freeze frame it
and use those so that you can replace it
if you're able to find a replacement
that is the same size actually we should
measure to the size - all right so if
you can't find this exact one and you're
wondering I wonder if another one exists
out there that's the same size because
of the size does actually impact whether
you can use it or not on this so roughly
50 by 35 give yourself a millimeter to
breathe and then this is the more
interesting bit another arm stm32 l/100
so Logitech is able to save some money
by ordering a ton of those and using
that in everything so the same one I
think that we saw any power play mat and
we've got some power hooked up to a
metal plate which is where does that sit
here's that part of the coil or is that
part of the that looks like it's maybe
part of the coil so this thing right
here which connects to the power play
module just every time your power play
sounds like poker gambling or something
that connects through here metal to
metal over here and this is hooked up to
what looks like a ground or common and
then there's your power line which I
don't know if that's 5 volts maybe
there's your what looks like a 5 volt
and a common or a ground and that's
going into what else we have ribbon
cable goes into the top portion so the
ribbon cable is connecting up here which
i think is sending your data back and
forth the mass of these mice those
scroll wheels on these Logitech mice are
pretty cool they've got this switch
right here that depresses you push that
button which it's obviously already
pushed right now there you go so I push
it and it will I think apply force to
this thing right here yes that mechanism
so this mechanism is pretty
you push this button and it engages so
right now we've got the very tactile
response and it's stopped I mean it does
one take at a time if you can see down
here through the camera there's a ton of
spokes in there so it's got a lot of
points of engagement it engages on each
one of the spokes so those spokes are
you get POV on that and then each one
engages and then if we do this as many
of you probably know the model tech mice
it does the hyper scroll which I
actually use this a lot for scrolling
through your spreadsheets you just kind
of hit the button to toggle between them
and then that gets you to the bottom of
page real quick so pretty cool stuff but
that's a that's loosely how that works
sorry what the switching is engaging
this piece of this black plastic here
underneath the clear plastic moves it's
like a shoe so I push that you see a
move so right now we're engaged we're
engaging the break and let's release it
is your hyper scroll I'm not gonna click
it down this time just push partway and
what's happening is over here on this
side you see a metal bar and that bar
goes across and what's engaging this I
mean it's it's basically like throwing a
stick into into the spokes of a bike
that what's that is what's engaging us
right yeah that's pretty cool so here's
the see the plot this is the plastic
shoe I was pointing out so when I push
that button it's engaged yes I push the
button the shoe is releasing tension
from the metal bar which brings the
middle of our backwards and when the
middle bar goes that direction it's
dragging against scroll wheel on the
inside right there
pretty cool I'm not gonna take the rest
of this apart I really it's just we've
done it before it's a lot of work it
never goes back together and you don't
really learn anything special other than
what we've already done without more of
an engineering background in this kind
of thing so
so there's your scroll wheel the other
buttons were contained here so switches
for these buttons are on these PCBs
it's me one per set of switches they are
on run switches like normally a lot of
tech technically doesn't doesn't tell us
that information because they could
always change the pliers they don't
wanna be locked in but they would choose
one with the same spec so fifty million
clicks or whatever it is these days
twenty to fifty million depending on
what you're looking at for the mouse but
yeah I think that's it so let's uh let's
leave it at that for this one pretty
cool it's you know it's getting fun to
do these like the point is like I said
sometimes it's just cool it's just cool
to see what's underneath sometimes you
learn something the battery replacement
information might be useful for someone
but ultimately it's just you know I was
curious how that hyper scroll system
worked I've looked in the past
I don't remember figuring it out last
time because I think I might have
stopped last time I took a part of a
Logitech mouse because I didn't want to
completely destroy it cuz I was actually
using it so this one's a sacrificial
lamb but yeah pretty cool see how it
just just entirely mechanical little
break that shoots into a spoke so I
think that's it for this one you can
subscribe for more we do tear downs like
this on stuff fairly regularly video
cards are the main one where we look at
the VRMs and talk about how the BRM
design works things like that subscribe
for that otherwise patreon.com slash
camera's nexus helps out directly and as
always articles and things like that on
gamers nexus dotnet shirts gamers exodus
at squarespace.com and logitech I'll get
this back together I I'll let you guys
handle the the feet and as far as the
power play pad sorry but hey it was cool
so thanks for watching I'll see you all
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
