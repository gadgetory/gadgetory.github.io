cable Maude who are making a new
vertical GP amount that positions the
video card farther back in the case
theoretically lowering the thermals we
wanted to test this claim properly
though and it makes logical sense that a
card positioned farther from a glass
would operate cooler but we wanted to
test how that would work with air cooled
cards which are typically limited by the
gap between the glass and the cooler
itself by lengthening that gap by a
couple of inches performance should
increase significantly whereas typically
you only want to use these stock
vertical mounts with open-loop cooled
cards not with air cooled cards the
cable mod mount should push the card
enclosure to the motherboard which has
other interesting thermal
characteristics that we'll get into
today before that this video is brought
to you by Corsairs HS 70 wireless gaming
headset which focuses on comfort with
memory foam adjustable ear cups and a
padded headband the headset has a 40
foot low latency range over wireless
lasts for up to 16 hours of gaming use
and as extra focus on build quality to
ensure it lasts a long time
learn more at the link in the
description below so this is Kailen mods
new vertical GPU mount we showed it in
our ad pre-roll during competence and
now that we're back it's time to
actually dig into it and see how it
performs and we had some thoughts that
it would actually do as it promises
because ultimately you're talking about
socketing this into the PCIe expansion
slots and then pushing back the GPU
several inches I think the difference is
somewhere in the range of 2 to 3 or 4
inches really depending on the case for
testing so for our toss we're using a
cooler master H 500 M it does not
represent 100% of cases on the market of
course but it represents the majority of
them because ultimately all these cases
with vertical mounts they basically push
the card right up against the glass
which is fine for open-loop but not for
air and so this one pushes it closer to
the motherboard the question then
becomes what other limitations do you
have well one of them of course is that
you can't use any of the really lower
PCIe expansion slots for the most part
unless you were to do something like
what
you've seen with the new Thermaltake and
Coolermaster designs where they're just
taking a rotatable PCIe expansion cover
to completely flip it and either way you
potentially limit what other devices you
can put in there but most people only
use one device in any PCIe slots anyway
and that's a graphics card and if you're
using more things it's probably
something like a stream capture card or
something like that so for most people I
think you're using one GPU and our
testing here should look through and and
we'll find out exactly how much the
difference is for a horizontal baseline
test and a traditional configuration
versus a stock case vertical mount up
against the glass versus the kala mod
kit and this thing I think by the way is
still in production they're finalizing
it now so it'll be out in probably two
months or something like that maybe a
bit more so if you're interested in it
it'll be out on market eventually
they're just finalizing some production
right now let's get into the thermal
numbers for this as noted we're testing
with a cooler master h 500 mm for now it
uses the mesh front panel for this
testing so we've got more access to
intake we're not using the glass we
previously found at this case performed
reasonably well in our thermal testing
with the mesh on the front up near the
age 500p mesh case unsurprisingly we're
also swapping our standard GPU so these
results are not comparable to our other
case testing results we're using the
case testing bench but we've pulled the
GPU out and we've replaced it with a
1080 t is c2 from EVGA which has icx
sensors so it's got I think 9 total
thermistors placed around the board so
those give us some insights to power
component temperatures vram temperatures
stuff like that not just GPU
temperatures but we do have GP diet as
well finally testings conducted with a
30-minute loop of fire strike extreme
which we found to produce a realistic
heat load comparable to gaming but also
still a lot of heat and it's strictly on
the graphics cards there's very little
being done on the CPU so it's a great
test for that and for this we can just
move straight into the results I think
we have one chart for this one's very
simple so here it is blue represents
default horizontal mounting or baseline
red represents cabe
maude solution and orange represents the
stock age 500m vertical mounting a quick
glance shows that kilowatt solution
performs well overall and even matches
the baseline horizontal mounting in some
areas of the PCB the GPU core is within
margin of error between the Cable model
amount and the horizontal amount in the
H 500m but with that 44 degrees Celsius
over ambient the age 500m vertical mount
operates at 50 degrees marking a
noteworthy increase in temperature the
first two memory modules are also within
margin of error for horizontal and the
ko mod mount and again disadvantaged
with the stock vertical mods in the age
500m kala mod has proven that it's
possible to have a vertical GPU mount
without suffocating air-cooled cards at
least in this one case this is
particularly good news as some
manufacturers are moving to build cases
with this new vertical mounting format
in mind as you'll see in our copy tax
coverage of thermal takes level 20
series and of cooler masters SL 600 M we
start seeing meaningful differences in
the power component measurements
these are MOSFETs and inductors and are
producing a greater Delta as a result of
their location on the PCB some of the
warmer sensors are located towards the
bottom of the PCB below where the cooler
mm 1 mm 2 and GPU thermistors are
located this coincides with a slightly
higher Delta that we see in M 3
indicating that the power supply shroud
is a potential inhibitor to cooling for
the lower down components on the board
the VM components are also located out
of the most effective cone of cooling
for the 200 millimeter intake fans
furthering this and the difference isn't
massive but ko mod still does a better
job than the stock vertical mount it's
just that this is an interesting
highlight of how the air stream works in
the case the last point of consideration
for this is clock speeds because with
nvidia cards what will happen is every
couple degrees that you gain or lose
there is a clock speed difference
there's a hard throttle at about 84
degrees but below that all the way down
to below 60 there's still frequency to
be gained from a couple degrees
reduction in operating temperature for
these temperatures because we had the
EVGA fan fixed to 50% for both of the
fans we're operating at a low enough
temperature overall that there was
actually no meaningful change in
frequency for all the tests
it was about the same roughly 1840 to
1850 megahertz so no real difference
that would be exaggerated if you were to
put in a card with lower fan speeds or
perhaps use a case with even more
restricted cooling worst cooling on the
front something like that you would
start seeing greater thermal differences
there that could well the thermal
difference would not increase at a rate
linear to the frequency reduction so you
would see thermal differences up to a
point at which throttling kicks in
really hard and then to see differences
at that point you'd have to look at the
clocks now that the temperatures but for
this testing there was no meaningful
difference in clock speed because we
kept it cool enough to begin with we did
however measure a meaningful difference
in thermals so there's a real change
there so pretty clear and
straightforward for this as for more
extreme cases of course expect some
throttling in some areas but basically
the Cale mod mount if you can make it
work if you really want it I think it's
gonna be 60 bucks or so or something
like that so depending on your needs
it's potentially a bit steep if your
case doesn't support a vertical mount at
all it helps if it does support one but
you don't like it you can put it in
there anyway but at the end of the day
thermally it's about the same as
horizontal mounting in the age 500 I'm
your mileage will vary depending on case
but they should all be more or less the
same at least at a base level and then
the components lower down on the boards
yes they'll run a couple degrees warmer
than horizontal but still cooler than
traditional vertical in the case so we
had a lot of requests people wanted us
to validate their claims so we've done
the head I think it's really pretty
simple and that's it for this one is
