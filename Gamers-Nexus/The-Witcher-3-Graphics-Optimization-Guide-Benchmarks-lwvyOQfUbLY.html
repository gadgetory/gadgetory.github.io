Donna and today we're talking about
optimizing your graphics settings for
The Witcher 3 now The Witcher 3 I called
very poorly optimized just a couple days
ago in a video card benchmark we looked
at all the video cards performance in
The Witcher 3 show the FPS things like
that requires a lot of hardware to play
it properly and the graphics settings
weren't terribly optimized now
thankfully patch 1.3 just came out by CD
projekt red and this improved
performance tremendously for the PC this
is something that we've shown in our
testing so we're back today to show you
how to go through the settings in the
Witcher 3 describe all the settings like
chromatic aberration and things like
that and tell you how to tune those so
that you get more performance out of
your card without choosing just one of
the flat preset the high medium low
ultra settings the problem with just
choosing high to recover some of your
framerate so you're sitting at 40 or 50
with Ultra is that you can actually just
change normally one or two settings
rather than all of them across the board
so you can have a better looking game
and you don't have to sacrifice as much
as long as you make more careful
adjustment to these settings so this is
something we studied this is already in
full article form on the website and
I've categorized all the settings from
critical to negligible performance boost
depending on how you tweak them in the
game so you can check that out for
details I'm not going to talk about
every single setting in this video I did
in the article but that's just not time
friendly so we're starting with the most
critical item which is Nvidia's hair
works hair works is a part of the game
works SDK that Nvidia provides
developers and pair work specifically
tessellate s-- hair in a fashion that
basically creates more strands of hair
and then it also adds some physical
impact so when you're moving the hair
will actually sway side to side and you
can see this in geralt's hair when he's
bobbing around on the horse or whatever
you can see it moves differently with
this off in the form of growths we see
that his hair has a more standard
animation that looks as if it just sort
of repeats every time the horse Bob's so
it's less dynamic there's no physical
computation going on to determine how
the hair
you and there's no tessellation
craziness going on to create more
strands of hair if you have it on all
then everything like monsters Griffin's
whatever all those things will now have
tessellated hair it looks really cool
it's very physically active which is
cool but it's extremely intensive on the
GPU whether or not you have Nvidia or
AMD so here's a few things with this one
here's the performance chart with the
setting completely off you can see that
we're salvaging like 20 FPS or more in
some instances and with it on Geralt
it's about the same but a little bit
faster than with it completely on if
you're an AMD user you can actually go
into a renderer ini file and you can see
the location of that file on our website
and you can modify the hair tessellation
quality for hair work so you can lower
the quality if you want to use hair
works and force it on an AMD card like a
290x
technically it's compatible it's not
optimized for it because nvidia has no
business optimizing for andy's hardware
so it's not the best in terms of
performance but you can make it work the
next most critical item is foliage
viewing range this is basically the view
distance of foliage at what point do
plants and shrubbery and we inform
things like that start popping up and
popping as in the technical term here as
in when does the object physically pop
into view as you're moving closer to it
because these things aren't necessarily
rendered off screen you might be running
straight forward and you start seeing
foliage pop into view at the very end of
your camera viewing distance and this is
impacted by the foliage viewing range
you can see in the charts I have here
that this is actually the second or
potentially first most heavily impacting
item for frame rates in The Witcher 3
and you'll want to modify this and a
hair works to get the biggest FPS boost
out of your settings without dropping
any of the other settings so that is the
first item to see where this impacts the
most we can look at these two
screenshots I put them side-by-side and
if you look at the far left side of each
screenshot you'll notice that there's a
field and also a stack of hay in the
middle of the field in this instance the
low setting basically does not even
render that field so that's where you
see the
of this if that's something you really
want then you're just going to need
better harder because it is very
intensive luckily this is not something
that really impacts gameplay too much
the next item is ambient occlusion
ambient occlusion has been around in
games for a while it is the means
through which light interacts with
objects in the game and how it interacts
with translucent transparent surfaces so
if you have like a car window and GTA s
doesn't exist in the witcher obviously
but if you have a car window or
something the light will interact with
that window in a certain way and this
also is impacted by things like
reflectivity and reflection settings if
they're present in the witcher you can
see ambient occlusion effect basically
everything though you will see h bao
most prevalently when you're in like a
building that's got windows with the Sun
to your back this is an example Nvidia
put on their website and you can see how
h bao is less crazy with overshadowing
versus ssao ssao
is the mid-range technology it runs best
on both cards if you want some kind of a
Oh but don't want H Bao and it very
aggressively shadows objects so AO
ambient occlusion is most commonly seen
when services meet and shadows meat from
variant services so a shadow cast from
one service and another meat AO will
dictate how they interact with one
another and their host surface h bao is
more aggressive with its shadowing but
when necessary it'll back off the shadow
in detail so like when you're standing
in front of a window or right in front
of a light source or the Sun it's not
going to overshadow Kuralt like SSAO
well this has marginal impact on
performance and is worth tuning down to
SSAO at the least or off if you really
find no benefit from this and want the
extra frames per second shadow quality
is still impacting but only about 10 FPS
when you're going from low to ultra so
there's not a whole lot of room to play
in the in-between settings here and
shadow quality really just affects how
things look when you're in a dense area
with a light source that's cutting
through or reflecting off of or
interacting with multiple objects that
cast shadows on one another it's not
critical but it does actually add quite
a bit of depth to the game if you can
leave this on a higher setting
I would recommend it it makes the world
look less flat and ambient occlusion is
the same way it's less flat with ssao
grass density and the quality of grass
is something that we talked about in GTA
5 luckily in the witcher 3
grass is much less impacting on the
performance than in GTA 5 and you can
basically leave this at a higher setting
with almost no performance impact just
modify those other settings first before
you start touching this one
anti-aliasing in the witcher 3 is
actually a custom implementation by CD
Projekt RED it is not compatible to
witcher 3 with other TxAA or FXAA
technologies that are standard the
engine just can't do it so they have a
custom implementation it's very low
impact on performance from our testing
and to this end you can pretty much
leave it enabled it mostly just works
temporally meaning that the
anti-aliasing in The Witcher 3 is
looking at frames over time and then
trying to smooth out the shimmering
effect applied on things like grass
strands that are really thin so it makes
them look more dense and more there's
more continuity in your graphics texture
quality I already talked about in depth
in another video so I'll skip that but
basically you can leave it at ultra and
it's it's perfectly fine almost no
impact on FPS bit of impact on the RAM
check the other video for that and then
we jump into some of the other
negligible items detail level impacts
the decals how long they last and when
they're painted so decals are things
like blood splatter and scorched earth
when you're doing anything with fire
that has basically no impact on FPS from
our limited testing this is very
difficult to test in depth for the same
reason that you need dynamic combats
really start generating a lot of details
and that reduces the ease with which you
can reproduce a test so it makes it sort
of difficult to validate things but in
general you can leave it fairly high
water quality has almost no impact on
fps before other things start choking at
first and water quality just changes
like the wake that's behind Goro out
when he swims changes the splashes when
you jump into the water and stuff like
that background characters we could not
test Nvidia didn't either we checked
with that
and this is because the thresholds for
background characters need to be met at
75 100 130 or 150 for low medium high
ultra respectively and I couldn't find a
place with that many characters in one
spot and I definitely don't have the
time to actually play the game to get
that far because I'm benchmarking it so
- not something we could test
unfortunately blur and motion blur
basically no impacts don't need to
describe those because they're just how
blurry the screen is when you move
around a lot of people dislike this and
will just disable it because they don't
like how it looks you might find that to
be the case as well there's no
performance impact and no functional
gain terrain quality is a tesselation
feature that seems not functional right
now and terrain quality is supposed to
test like the land if you have a higher
so that it looks more detailed but it
really doesn't seem to be doing that
right now and I'm getting no FPS change
in my testing bloom has a very large
impact on the visuals of the game and
whether you like it or not is really a
subjective thing luckily there's really
not a performance difference as with all
these recent items because it's just a
filter it's applied on top of everything
else that's already rendered all the
hard stuff like geometry it's already
rendered so this is filtering the light
to create images like we're looking at
here where the Sun is it has a bloom
effect or where fire would have the
shimmering heat effect over the flame
that is bloom as well now all the other
settings I described very briefly in our
previous video
chromatic aberrations a photography term
I talked about a little bit and it's
discussed in the article in full check
the article for more information on
anything I didn't touch on here but this
should get you started for tweaking your
game so you can get more performance
there's also ini tweaks you can do so if
you're comfortable with playing around
within any file as they're called then
you can change the values in those files
to increase or reduce the quality level
objects drawn tessellated elements and
things like that
actually get more performance out of
your game or more visual fidelity
depending on how powerful your hardware
is and that's something I'll try to talk
about in the future if we don't move on
from The Witcher here in the next few
days but for now check out the links in
the description below for the full
article if you like this content please
subscribe we try to do these for every
major
game launch and definitely do things
like this for all the major video card
CP launches and speaking our CPUs I'm
trying to type CPUs on The Witcher 3
very shortly so subscribe for that if
you like our objective and journalistic
approach to coverage please check out
our patreon page it's a new campaign
we're starting to try and get these
things going at a faster pace increased
quality or building a video set bought
some expensive lights the other day so I
don't have to have lamps in each corner
as I've said in a few videos now and
that's pretty much all for this so I
will see you all next time
