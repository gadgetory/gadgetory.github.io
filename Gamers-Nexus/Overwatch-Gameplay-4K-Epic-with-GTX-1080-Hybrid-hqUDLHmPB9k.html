4k resolution with epic game settings
that is their highest game setting
available and that includes the highest
resolution textures overwatch we've
tested in the past we ran some
benchmarks back during the beta but
things have changed a lot since then
including of course the unveil of new
GPU architectures like Polaris and
Pascal from AMD and NVIDIA respectively
this particular gameplay footage that
you're watching right now was played on
a gtx 1080 card
it's tactically the founders edition but
those of you who follow our content will
know we've modified ours so this is a
GTX tennety hybrid as we call it it
actually has a liquid cooler mounted to
it and that means that it's running at
about 18 Celsius delta-t if you add back
in our ambience which is about 70
Fahrenheit maybe 20 ish Celsius that
puts you at probably around somewhere in
the 30s very high 30s low 40s somewhere
in that range is where our card is
operating right now because of the
liquid cooling mounted to the GPU and
that is while playing at this 4k
resolution with the maxed out settings
and we're seeing about 65 FPS on average
somewhere in that range don't really dip
below 62 regularly even in these heavy
combat sequences like the one you're
watching right now where there's a
couple good kill streaks and shots from
our gameplay tester here mic gag Leon
who also helped with the GT X 1080
benchmarking so we're running at on
average at least 60 FPS hitting 65 in
some instances and that is at 4k the
native resolution if you are interested
in playing at ultra wide just as an
example ultra wide assuming a 34 40 by
1440 display resolution is still going
to be fewer pixels than 4k which is 3840
by 2160 so you multiply those you get
the pixel count so that means if you're
playing ultra wide this is obviously
north of 60fps so with an ultra wide
you'll be north of 60fps as well and
won't have any trouble there especially
if you're playing with a 2560 by 1080 or
whatever the smaller ones are so this
gives you a good look at what overwatch
looks like now in terms of gameplay we
were pretty happy with how it plays it
is one of the best titles Blizzard has
worked on in quite a while now and
overall its
though the word MOBA is kind of attached
to everything these days
this one genuinely does feel like a
pretty chaotic battle arena but it's
more similar to a team shooter like Team
Fortress 2 for instance and some of
these maps are a little bit reminiscent
of things like the old team four or the
two fort map from Team Fortress 2 and
that's of course one of the classic ones
there's the push game mode so much that
team deathmatch which is mostly what
you're watching and overall the gameplay
does feel very fluid it's predictable
the attacks are telegraphed in a way
that makes sense but isn't too cerebral
like new game from the team making age
of chivalry which is arcane warfare and
that's a bit more there's more
telegraphing going on which is basically
when the developers build in certain
animations or moves to try and convey it
to players what attack is about to
happen so there's no frustration in
combat so there is some of that here as
you can see but overall it's very much
just a chaotic shooter and it's sort of
similar to Team Fortress 2 in that
regard so game plays good performance is
very good again 60 plus FPS here we've
seen that pretty much every card can
play this game I believe we tested all
the way down to a 750ti previously and
that really had no problems if you
lowered the settings down towards their
lowest values and kept it at 1080 which
is about what you expect with a 750 Ti
at this point anyway 950 960 those do
very well on AMD side you run something
like an r9 380 X you can get pretty
close to the ultra settings maxing it
out this is an interesting game because
at 1080p there's really no value for the
most part setting these epic settings
that we have configured here and that's
just because a lot of the detail will be
lost in the chaos of gameplay so unless
you're trying to take really fancy
screenshots or something you're getting
no benefit from the epic settings and
it's worth just dropping down to ultra
to preserve your vram and things like
that
this card DT X 1080 has 8 gigabytes of
VRAM gddr5 X which assists in reducing
the the memory bandwidth throttles that
you may see in older generation cards
but it's not perfect and we still do
need eventually HBM too but for now G
DDR
5x is working pretty well gddr5 still
works pretty well just depending on how
high your core clock is because that is
the main point of contention with
bottleneck in the memory so that is our
quick look at overwatch from Blizzard
and that's running again on a gtx 1080
you can check our GT X 1080 review on
the channel thanks for watching I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
