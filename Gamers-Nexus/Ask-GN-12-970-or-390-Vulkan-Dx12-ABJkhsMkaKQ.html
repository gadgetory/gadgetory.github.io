donna and we are back for another
episode of ask GN it's been a while
probably a month or two because we have
been slammed with one content piece
after another as you've all seen but i
want to come back and visit ask GN and
the new questions that have been posed
on all of the direct extrav in bulk and
content especially so starting us off we
have a question from store-brand great
name by the way who says if nvidia cards
that need an sli bridge to connect in i
guess normal sli how does the 970
connect to the 390 x without the bridge
so this was specifically on the sli fire
video we did where we talk about running
multiple cards from different brands
under something called explicit
multi-gpu in directx 12 so this test in
particular was run with the ashes of
singularity the 390 x and the 970 that
we ran were not connected by a bridge of
any kind they were just in the PCIe
slots and that is done there is
something called MDA or multi display
adapter the normal setup for sli is LD a
link display adapter and the test we did
for DirectX 12 does not require a bridge
they communicate strictly through the
PCIe interface they talk through the
PCIe bus instead of that one gigabyte
per second bridge that always sits on
the top of the card so Direct X 12 is
able to use MDA so that multi-brand
cards can be configured in the same
system and talk to one another without a
proprietary bridge and it also does mean
that you would be able to ditch bridges
in the future for sli potentially
depending on how Nvidia and the game
developers work with this technology now
for direct six eleven you're still using
bridges for sli and for md the crossfire
bridge is actually not required anymore
for most modern setups so next question
then is from a non Amos so anonymous
says so when are we going to see actual
gains in games with regard to Vulcan and
DirectX 12 and then he says again when
so anonymous the answer that question
from the Vulcan versus directx11 video
is pretty simple really it
just depends on when game developers
start integrating this technology into
their games properly and I keep
mentioning this in these videos but we
talk about this with chris Roberts in a
Vulcan and Direct X 12 interview a while
ago and it's actually got some really
good content about this exact point and
the answer is that developers need to
actually build their games from the
ground up to see real games for these ap
is as opposed to just sort of changing
the calls to the API the API calls and
the code because you can definitely call
Direct X 12 or Vulcan and just sort of
plant the API in there pull it up as
necessary on devices that are compatible
with it but it doesn't mean that the
advantages will be scenes the end user
so to see those advantages the
developers need to build ground up they
have to do special things for
optimization for even things like the
explicit multi-gpu that needs to be
handled explicitly through the developer
they need to sit there and make sure
it's functional not just sort of
included as a package the same goes for
any other optimizations or feature sets
within these various ap is so the short
answer is it depends I would probably
say at least a year before we start
seeing real serious gains from dx12 and
Vulcan and serious implementation
attempts but right now so many people
are still on Windows 7 and Windows 8
that it doesn't make a whole lot of
sense to go exclusive to DX 12 and those
who have gone or claim to have gone
exclusive the DX 12-4 generally
exclusivity with the Windows Store I
would probably argue that it's actually
not as optimized as it could be because
most of these games you have to remember
they're in development for years at a
time often and the x12 hasn't really
been ready for quite that long so they
may just be more of the the changing
calls types of game support for the new
api's so definitely a year probably more
than that for actual serious gains and
at that point the fidelity will be amped
up enough that we start forgetting about
the gains that were given because the
game graphics will improve hopefully in
step with the amount of overhead that
the APS removed from the cpu and so
forth next question is from guglielmo
Miguel ax who said I'm wondering maybe I
lost it when you set it but it
there any difference in the CPU usage at
all between dx11 and the x12 here in
ashes of singularity or AOS so that was
in the SLI fire video also and the
answer is yes actually one of the
biggest things for these new AP is
directors 12 in Vulcan explicitly is
that they remove a lot of overhead from
the cpu and they do that by handling
draw calls differently so draw calls
will get fed into the GPU instead which
is a parallel processor it's got more
cores available to run these geometric
draw calls like draw calls basically
when the cpu tells the GPU hey it's time
to draw this piece of geometry on the
screen and the GP does it but if we
remove the cpu from that process it
actually speeds things up a lot or yet
at least reduce the CPUs workload in
that process because the CPU is a
sequential processor can only do one of
these at a time even though it can do
many many transactions per second could
be billions of cycles per second depend
on what you're working with so directx
11 and 12 yes there's a big difference
between the CPU performance in DX 11 and
12 under ideal situations going back to
the previous question I just answered if
the game is not really fully built
ground up for dx12 the know you might
actually see some performance loss
depending on the level of driver support
the video card using as asynchronous
sort of tuned and the game's
optimization with that particular API so
that's the that's the story right now
for dx11 vers 12 with cpu support and
then we've also got one a sort of off
question here that's not related to the
new AP is and that was from a masseuse
said what a cheap psu tester do the same
job as the multi multi meter that we
used in the motherboard on fire video so
when we let our motherboard on fire
accidentally and use the multimeter to
check the power supply voltage on each
of the rails and each of the pens that
was to show that yes 12 volts it's
coming through 5 volts coming through
3.3 volts coming through whatever yes if
you get a psu tester even it's a
twenty-dollar one it will basically do
the same job most of them the good ones
have lcds on them they have display is
to show you what the voltages are in the
very least they just light up and say
good or bad
and that would make your life a bit
easier if you're doing this regularly if
you already own a multimeter is cheaper
to use the multimeter and test it but if
you don't then it's probably cheaper to
buy just a cheapo $20 psu tester and
test the voltage that way multimeters of
course are a lot more versatile there so
I would recommend getting one if you're
doing this type of stuff regularly the
last question here is from loquera who
says what should I get GTX 970 or r9 390
or r9 390 excuse me not to X and that's
from the previous ask GN video this
depends so the GTX 970 we've seen
outperform the 390 x and a lot of games
lately and that just sort of depends on
which games they are and who the
developers are and that's because of the
game works optimizations and all these
other things that are in there where
Nvidia maybe more optimized on either
their drivers or on the game software
side to better support the NVIDIA GPUs
and that benefits the GTX 970 in the
matchup between 972 390 or 3 90 x that
said they trade blows a lot especially
as you increase the resolution and we
see AMD generally does start to swing
favourably against nvidia when the
resolution is pushed to 1440p or
similarly high resolutions so that is
one instance where Andy does have a bit
of an advantage depends on what kind of
monitor and resolution setup you're
planning to go with but the thing with
the resolution increase is if you're
working with an ultra-wide or something
like that you basically just take the
the width times the height that gives
you your total pixel count so once you
expand past 1920 x 1080 whatever that is
a couple million the actually more than
that I've once you expand past that
point and he does start getting a bit of
an advantage with their game processing
and that's because the way the pixel
pipeworks Andy does better raw
throughput of pixel processing for high
resolutions whereas Nvidia will often
handle things like filtration tasks and
all these post FX and things like that a
bit better than AMD so just the sort of
truncated answer is it depends both are
good GPUs both are
affordable right now but I would say
look at what you're playing does the
game you you want to play maybe invest
hundreds or thousands of hours into does
it tend to favor the 970 with the 390
you can find that in a lot of our
benchmarks or other people's benchmarks
and then look at things like extras so
with that video card you get shadowplay
and things like that and the has its own
video capture software I personally will
say that we do use shadow play for our
game capture because a bit easier to
work with and it's pretty reliable and
these GV are basically DVR but gbr for
games was good I am not sure how it
works these days because it's been sort
of metamorphism to play as TB and all
this other stuff with Raptor but that is
one thing to look at power consumption
while draw of course is an argument as
well and then if you really care about
overclocking maybe you're an enthusiast
you would want whatever card high-end
card in either the 970 or 390 class or 3
90 x class that will give you the most
overhead for play with overclocking if
that's important to you but otherwise
look at the price and then look at the
benchmarks for the particular games that
you want to play that should basically
answer it there's no real wrong choice
here for the most part so that is all
for this video other than one last throw
in question here that we had posted just
before filming this and is from the
high/low 623 who says quote are you ever
