out we keep it in here but there's a
there's a security hole so I got to get
it out of there today we're doing a
little bit of a looser format for a
video the plan is to talk about what
we've learned from d-lighting at this
point a pretty good amount of processors
including 379 80 xc70 900 X so 960 X the
80s 700 K 7700 K and a couple others for
other youtubers as well so there's a lot
of small stuff we've learned here
primarily centering around resealing in
a normal user environment you're
probably going to reseal the lid to the
CPU somehow after you delete it because
otherwise you can't turn it vertically
and you have to hold on to the IHS
against the substrate all the time
which doesn't really user-friendly so we
talked about things we've learned there
and also going through a couple of
thermal notes on performance when
deleting helps when it doesn't and what
you can expect overall before that this
video is brought to you by thermal
Grizzly makers of the conductor not
liquid metal that we recently used to
drop 20 degrees off of our coffee leak
temperatures thermal grizzly also makes
traditional thermal compounds we use on
top of the IHS like cryo not and hydro
not pastes learn more at the link below
so this isn't a deal it tutorial so much
as it is the things do after you've
taken the lid off and what you need to
know couple things here with d-lighting
there's a lot of rhetoric around this
process where it's kind of gotten a bit
extreme where because people see media
outlets doing it and you see sometimes
20 degrees Celsius improvements you'll
see you need to deal in to overclock or
it has to be deleted to perform well
thermally that's simply not true for the
current generation of CPUs Intel can
absolutely do better with how they're
transferring their energy from the die
to the IHS but you don't actually have
to deal it in 8700 K it's got HCC CPU
thermal paste on there now so the high
core count stuff from the 79 80 X II is
on the 8700 K as far as we're aware and
that helps a lot with thermal
performance but you do want to do later
once you start pushing higher overclock
so
as you get towards for example 4.6 4.7
gigahertz on the i9 series it's kind of
impossible to keep it cool without
either extreme cooling or a deal it and
if the D letting gets you anywhere from
10 to 20 degrees it's instantly worth it
it's also helpful because if you're
trying to keep lower noise levels by
lowering the fan speed you can help that
process by deleting the CPU the thermal
transfer is a lot better so it gets rid
of the heat more efficiently and you can
run lower fan RPMs so that's another
benefit so you don't strictly need to
deal it but if you're pushing higher
over clocks you want lower fan noise or
you want to buy a smaller cooler then
there's advantage to D letting the trick
though is what to do sort of after
you've deleted the processor because
applying liquid metal isn't too hard but
it is something that I struggled with
the first time I did it and it takes a
bit of a practiced hand or eye to really
figure out and there not a lot of great
YouTube videos out there to show the
amount of liquid metal to use without it
becoming just a pool of electrically
conductive potentially damaging liquid
metal so we'll show some of that today
this is an i-9 7900 X CPU that I
previously deleted it has never been
resealed so after we deleted it we left
the the silicon adhesive off of it and
it's as simple as just like physically
pulling the IHS off to open it up again
so for this one because I never resealed
it I can just open it like that and this
one hasn't been open since it was sealed
this is pretty normal for how it looks
after liquid metal has been applied and
you've removed the eye adjust again so
we have liquid metal on both sides here
things to know
so this processor we only scraped off a
very little amount of this silicon
adhesive and as we iterated our process
for deleting things kind of learned a
few tricks about this the silicon
adhesive in this case doesn't really
impact they're almost to negatively
there's not a lot of it it's not too
gunked-up and ultimately what you're
dealing with is
a CP that's going to be left loose we're
not we never resealed it so it wasn't a
big deal
but if you want to improve well two
things here if you have to reseal it
because you're planning to use it in a
computer or transport it or anything
like that where it might be vertical you
don't want to worry about it
we've been using this jb weld it's just
a silicon adhesive they're not a sponsor
or anything I just bought it on Amazon
we previously used UHU high-temperature
sealant the same thing couple problems
with this stuff it likes to explode out
of the back so it's kind of annoying to
use resealing it's pretty annoying too
because it gets all gunked up but it
comes out like a slope black glue
basically and that's what they use for
the most part it's a high temperature
silicone adhesive and to get it on there
you really want to get some of this old
stuff off so you can use your fingernail
for that you can grab something that's
capable of scraping and just kind of
pick at it get it out of there the
trouble is when you do this you really
need to be careful of a few things one
of them is the small surface mount
components around the parameter of the
CPU so we have these capacitors and
resistors around the edges and though is
if if you're going out this with the
scraper with your fingernail or whatever
and you pull against one of those by
accident it's very likely you're gonna
rip it off there's it's not a lot of
holding them on there so be careful when
doing that you can see some of the
silicone adhesive right here is right up
against the component this is an area I
would leave it alone or do my best to
avoid coming into contact with those so
that's one major thing to look out for
the most in the delayed process the most
likely thing to get damaged is one of
these small components and the most
likely cause of that damage is you not
the Delian tool so be careful scraping
stuff off and also when you're dealing
with small components don't panic if one
comes off chances are it's a capacitor
if it's a capacitor the processor will
still work almost definitely you might
lose some ripple suppression or some
overclocking head room but it'll still
worry it's not the end of the world if
you if you pull something else off there
might be over but don't panic too much
if something does come off so that's
some of the basics in an unstructured
way of what to be careful of and things
like that we'll get to applying the
adhesive in a moment but first let's
look at the liquid metal side of things
if you want to remove liquid metal
conduct or not the thermal grisly stuff
comes with these black q-tips that are
actually really good they're the cotton
schemes whatever reason the cotton seems
tighter wound on these than what we
normally buy so we can find a q-tip with
like a tightly wound whatever it is on
the end there that's not gonna come off
and cotton candy style that would be
ideal
and you can just put some rubbing
alcohol on the end of it so we're just
gonna go right down the middle and take
some of this off and you'll see that
it's pretty cooperative you can actually
see some of the liquid metal still shiny
on there this is stuff you don't really
want to get it on your skin it is an
irritant it's probably I've gotten it on
my skin I've been fine how your skin
reacts is different potentially but you
know just try and keep it off as in
general as rule another thing is if you
have blobs of this stuff you can
actually siphon it back up into the tube
so we can demo that here just by pulling
the the putting the nozzle on so let's
try and save from this blob there it
goes it's gone
got that one too so it's pretty easy to
get it back in there if you needed to
but we don't we don't need to reclaim
this we have plenty more conduct or not
so I'm just gonna wipe this off with a
paper towel and this stuff can really if
it's been on there awhile like this has
it can stick a bit so sometimes I'll
take the IHS and just run it under water
for a second and dry it thoroughly
afterwards just a high pressure water
we'll get the rest off with some manual
scrubbing with your thumbs or something
or a sponge but you can see how we've
got some residual stuff still on there
and it will come off it's just a matter
of how much effort it is to get that
back off okay so if we wanted to really
be thorough on this I'd go blast it with
some water and dry it off and clean it a
bit more but the purpose isn't to reseal
it right now it's to do demos so what
I'm going to do next let's just kind of
pretend I wash the rest of that off I
want to do next to show you how much
liquid metal to apply from a lot of
testing where we've done a lot of trial
and error I've had deleted CPUs that
just simply would not perform well they
would perform worse than stock and
that's because I often didn't have
enough liquid metal on there so you need
liquid metal on both sides you need it
on the IHS and on the die and that's
because of the surface tension of liquid
metal blob just fell happy that's
because of the surface tension of the
liquid metal you'll need on both sides
otherwise it's just not going to make
contact it won't transfer it'll be worse
than Tim next thing is so we're gonna to
apply some liquid metal all I'm gonna do
is take the syringe and just kind of
apply some downward force on it like
that and eventually you'll get a drop
that comes out so we just have one drop
on the end there I don't need to use the
plunger just kind of apply gravity and
that's going to be pretty close to
enough for
and i7 kb lake style cpu where you're
dealing with a much smaller surface area
for this we're gonna do a little bit
more because it is an i-9 CPU so we're
gonna do two drops for this one as
opposed to just maybe one of those on KB
Lake and then to spread the stuff you
can use the same q-tip I was
recommending a moment ago and I actually
to show you kind of how long this stays
good I've had this liquid metal on here
for probably two months at this point
and it's still like I can still apply it
to services it goes on like pain just
like that and it's still perfectly good
that's been on there for at least a
month at this point so you get use out
of these there's a lot of discussion
online about liquid metal evaporating
that's not really what happens some
types of liquid metal can crack over
time
conductor not specifically should be
good for about at least two years we
have some stuff in long term thermal
testing that's been going for several
months now and it's thermally the same
as it was when the test started so it
lasts a lot longer than some of the
comments would have you believe but it
depends a lot on what you use so yeah
this is we've got some applied here and
when you want to move it around it's
just like paint and because of the way
because of the surface tension of liquid
metal if you have some on the tip of the
spreading surface it'll behave
differently than if you don't sometimes
it'll pull the liquid metal back up
sometimes it'll spread it out
so this is pretty good right here and
you're going to want to apply it in a
way that it's just over the dye
obviously and when you REBOUND this IHS
it will have to go in the same
orientation as when it came off so a
good way to tell that on I nine CPUs is
to look at the RFID chip in the corner
here and that RFID chip has a cutout in
the IHS for clearance right here in this
corner it's the only corner with a
cutout so you would just align this one
on here like that and that'd be the end
of that the KB Lake and other CPUs have
other indicators you'll have to look at
those on a per CPU basis but this is a
pretty good amount of spread I would be
happy with this it would perform well if
you kind of we can try and get some
shots of it it's not liquidy enough to
drip if I hold it vertically it's not
gonna drip down but it is liquidy enough
that you can kind of see it shimmer a
bit on the service as opposed to a bunch
of streaks which would be too thin
would be the opposite problem you don't
have enough on there and I'm going to
show you what we don't want on this CPU
so there's kind of a pool in the middle
here and this is just left over from
when we pulled it off
that pool would be too much it'll spread
out it'll come out around the edges of
the dye and then you risk shorting
components around them to prevent
shorting you can grab a nail polish
there are certain types of nail polish
you don't want to use we have some
information and some of our old articles
I'll link one below if I remember too
that will tell you what to look for in a
nail polish for this you'll sound a bit
weird if you go to a beauty salon and
ask for a nail polish that is not
electrically conductive or something
that won't corrode your substrate but if
you use our information it should help
out so you would take a little a tiny
amount of this we already have some on
there too much honestly I put too much
on there because this is the first one I
ever did but you take a tiny amount of
this and you would find whatever
component you want to cover up and you
just apply it like that that's it's kind
of on the heavy side but the point of
this is to build a bit of a shield and
encasing or a moat around electrically
around components that are electrically
active and then if the liquid metal
spills over the side it will never get
to those components it'll contact the
the nail polish and as long as you buy
something that can withstand a high
temperature which this stuff can you'll
be good to go so that's a tip to protect
the components and then at this point
you would just spread the rest of it but
we don't need to do that
of course you don't have to use a liquid
metal you can use something like cryo
knot or some other MX whatever five some
other compound that's not electrically
conductive it'd just be a paste but the
problem then is you don't get as much
benefit so how do you get benefit out of
D Lydian if you're just using thermal
paste well ideally you scrub a bunch of
this adhesive off because this adhesive
creates space in between the IHS and the
die and that's not gonna help you out
thermally it's actually gonna make
transfer more difficult and will either
require more compound or well yeah it'll
just straight require more compound and
more interface the transfer through is
worse you want as little paste or liquid
metal on there as possible because
ideally you just want die to copper
contact not die to compound that's a
tenth of a millimetre thick to copper
contact or whatever so in an ideal world
you'd have no compound but it's not an
ideal world so we have to have something
and this stuff I tend to just scrape it
off with my thumbnail because it's it's
safe I can control it a little more
easily and what we've learned we have
some charts on this we can show too
what we've learned is that you really
with these I nines all I need to take
off one layer and you can leave the
other layer on there as a guidance for
when you remount the IHS so here are
some numbers for that previously we
worked on Kyle's CPU bit wit Kyle we
deleted his 79 80
II and worked on an r6e motherboard with
1.2 4 volts intentionally torturous over
voltage really and 4.5 gigahertz clock
and we observed peak temperatures of 104
degrees Celsius which is t.j.maxx when
sealed with a heavy amount of silicone
adhesive in fact it was actually
technically worse than the Intel stock
Tim and adhesive in some cases we also
observed improvements upwards of 20
degrees Celsius by using a lighter seal
strictly on the upper layer of the IHS
for the GN 79 ad AXI we were at 75
degrees on sealed versus 94 degrees peak
with the stock Tim so that's another 20
degrees difference not quite as warm as
Kyle CPU but their different CPUs so
there's some disparity there as well so
for the adhesive we'd recommend removing
just one layer leave the other as
guidance you can always undo it and
remove the other layer later because
ultimately removing both layers we found
is less than a 3 degree improvement it's
it tends to be like 2 which is kind of
within an error of testing so it's not
really an improvement and all you're
trying to do is just get enough off that
you can close it without too much
interference so I'm gonna scrape one
corner off and show you how to apply the
adhesive so this is about where I would
stop for cleaning the corner we've got
most of the adhesive off it's just kind
of a smudge there now and then for
applying new adhesive I only do it on
the IHS so what we're gonna do is just
kind of look at where that is that's
gonna be on this corner up here so I'm
going to apply some adhesive just on
this boot sort of on each one of these
is what I would do you can also do on
the inner layer here but we've found it
less important so let's get some of that
going ok so I'm just gonna open this lid
and stuff smells typically you would use
the nozzle but we're not we're
intentionally applying very little for
demonstration purposes so see let's off
so I don't have to smell it anymore
you probably want to wear
some kind of paper mask or something if
you're working closely with this stuff
and you're leaning over the CPU but so
let's just put some on one of these
corners this one's pretty scrubbed off
already I'll put some there I have found
that so if you're using it like a a what
do they call them if you're doing like
piping like like baking piping with it
that's a little bit too heavy where if
you kind of go along the edge with the
nozzle it will actually be too thick
that would be about the heavy seal what
we did with Kyle's and your performance
will be worse as a result I would
recommend spreading it manually and I've
technically I do this with my finger you
really shouldn't it isn't a skin
irritant I don't know what kind of
effects it has but it's easier I don't
recommend doing it that way though but
you spread it out kind of thin on the
surface and then when you reseal it
you'll be just really surprised at how
much that does for you I'd probably stop
around there I think typically and then
you just do this on each of the four
corners and it's really not going to
come off so what you would do next is
you can use the D litter tool to reseal
it often they come with a clamp that
pushes down right on the middle of the
top IHS what I've been doing is I
actually will socket it
unplug the systems you're not tons of
diagonally turn it on socket it and
install the cooler and just let it clamp
and that should be enough to apply force
let it sit depending on what kind of
adhesive it is this stuff takes about an
hour to get an initial dry I leave it
alone for a lot longer than you need to
I leave it alone for overnight basically
as my rule because I've had enough
problems where I've had to deal it them
again and again and reapply liquid metal
on it sucks so I just leave it overnight
at this point to make sure it's not an
issue with the sealant and don't apply
more than this because if you do your
performance it's gonna be worse another
common problem here is hot spots on the
core so it's pretty common to have an
issue where you go back into test
thermal performance and you see every
core is at 60 degrees
then you have wanted 104 so that could
have happened because there's not enough
liquid metal in a particular area or
like we have right here you might have a
dot of adhesive that was scraped off so
right at the tip of the pen there
there's a black dot in the pool of
liquid metal so it's hard to see but
that black dot is from when I was
scraping off silicone adhesive so if you
do that just that could definitely cause
a hot spot on one of the cores because
you're not getting contact anymore with
something that's highly conductive this
liquid metal is like seventy three watts
per meter Kelvin and the silicone
adhesive is temperature resistant so you
don't you don't want there that cause
that would cause poor performance and
deleting it again and applying liquid
metal will fix it for another example we
recently just deleted Ed's CPU from tech
source and for that one we used an ax
299 dark motherboard from EVGA so the
results are different it actually pushes
a lot more current through the CPU than
the ram-paige six extreme and this is
running blender at 4.5 gigahertz with
1.2 volts for voltage we observed about
14 degree improvements from peak core
temperatures to peak core temperatures
keeping in mind that we were throttling
previously so we have no way of knowing
how much higher the temperature would
have gone had the clocks been on
throttled so that's some of the
practical basics another note would be
clean thoroughly which I didn't do here
but clean it thoroughly before you apply
liquid metal use just rubbing alcohol
q-tip something like that and in terms
of the next step its you should do this
before deal it in as well but knowing
how it's a test is really important
because people will say well I'm only
getting a 1 degree improvement or I'm
getting a 40 degree improvement or
whatever and neither of those numbers
should be happening it's certainly
possible at least on the 1 degree side
it's it's possible that the seal was too
heavy or the liquid metal application
was too thin or something like that but
the bigger likelihood is that the
testing isn't adequate there are thermal
testing is really difficult to do right
so I'm gonna give you some quick basics
it's not enough for for what we do in
terms of reporting thermal data making
cards and everything but it's enough
where you'll be able to get a good idea
of if you're dealing work properly
before testing probably is hardware info
64 open that up set it to log data don't
just spot check it it's not good enough
because you will bias the numbers so set
it to log data over time ideally every
second or something like that run an
application that you know will create a
pretty common or a pretty steady rather
current load going into the CPU so if
you have for example blender is pretty
much a straight line sometimes it'll
spike higher than others you have to
keep an eye out on it you can clamp the
the piece the EPS 12-volt cables to get
a bit more accuracy so if you put a
current clamp on them then you'll know
if it's drawing more power than it did
last time but not everyone's gonna do
that so hardware info 64 will give you a
wattage reading for the CPU that tends
to be pretty accurate with most Intel
CPUs so you can rely on that for the
basics and if it's drawing way more
power in one test than the other you
need to rerun it a few times and get a
couple different numbers because
ultimately the thing that drives
temperature and heat is the power
consumption and sometimes some software
drives more power than others you take
something like an AV X low wear clothes
like blender or prime95 29.2 and you
compare it to a non AV x workload like
prime 26.6 the temperature numbers are
going to be hugely different because
with a BX
you might have to AVX instructions
spinning off on each core because you
have two threads on each core whereas
with non AVX a lighter workload with
lower power requirements so the point is
to test you need consistency consistency
you need a consistent power load blender
is pretty good prime is good but it's
power cycles and sometimes it'll power
cycle hard so what you should do is plot
the the power consumption over time if
you can get it from hardware info or a
current clamp and then look at the the
power cycles during that test and then
when you do the nut the next test later
after the deal it you compare the power
cycles again you pick two of the peaks
or two of the lows or whatever where the
power is about the same for each test
and you come here those two numbers and
you average that data over the period of
time that it was at steady-state not the
period of time the test is running
because it will be ramping up in
temperature but the steady state
temperature if you're under something
like a 280 millimeter liquid cooler let
the test run for half an hour so that
the liquid can fully saturate so to
speak and you're at steady-state at that
point with the liquid so the radiator
shouldn't be changing the behavior at
that point and all you have to do now is
average a couple of numbers and you'll
get your temperature value we would
recommend checking all of the core
temperatures and averaging those and
then you can also check peak to peak or
differences something with intel cpu
with cpus in general is that the cores
all behave differently so every now then
you'll have one that's 20 degrees higher
than another one that's okay it's not a
big deal it doesn't mean you did
anything wrong just make sure that
they're both lower than they were when
it was thermal paste it's not uncommon
to see 20 degree Delta is between cores
depending on what's happening on each
core during the test so that's kind of
normal but there's a lot of bad test
data out there and you'll see users
compare temperatures like they're a fire
strike score like well I got 70 degrees
why did you get 50 degrees not really
how it works there's a lot of stuff that
goes into it
the software is a big part of it the
liquid cooling solution or air cooling
solution is the biggest part of it and
so you need to have consistent testing
and don't compare to other people
compared only to your own numbers just
collect them properly beforehand there's
a lot more we can do on that but when I
I loaned Paul our D leading kid I
actually sent him a pretty detailed
overview of how to test and how to deal
with it again and reapply looking at all
that stuff and the point of it was that
testing these things you really only get
one shot at it cuz after you've deleted
it you can't go back and test it stock
again so spend the time beforehand test
it properly stock and then do it after
and and just kind of average numbers at
steady-state with an active constant
load level there's a power your numbers
should be good so I think abouts most
the basics you might have some power
from deviating for every 10 degrees
Celsius that you drop CPU temperature we
see about a 4% decrease in power
consumption that's from power leakage
its operating more efficiently and this
is well plotted at this point with a lot
of CPUs and tests so you'll see some
change but not a ton and I think that's
most my notes here it's pretty pretty
disorganized but the point was here's a
bunch of ideas during the process that
we've encountered and problems we've
encountered an experience I've gained
doing the leads they're not necessary
you don't need to do them but there's
something to be said for an enthusiast
task it does improve your temperatures
significantly in a lot of cases and that
can give you other benefits whether or
not they are necessary or useful to you
is up to you but hopefully that helps
somewhat there's a lot more I could say
here but we got to cut it at some point
so I'll cut this one for now if there
are more questions about this we'll
revisit it the testings probably the
most detailed part if we wanted to
really go detail with it but I think
that should give you some pointers to
get started for now and check our D lid
coverage you just search google for
gamers Nexus deal it or something at
this point you'll find a lot of
different data on it though stuff we did
for Kyle CPU and for our own 79ad XE was
pretty interesting that'll get you
started on the coverage side and that's
it for now thank you for watching is
