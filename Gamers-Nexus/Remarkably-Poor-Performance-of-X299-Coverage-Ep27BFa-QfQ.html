industry that has the power to command
coverage whenever they make a move MD
and Vidya and Intel when one of these
companies Dan's making announcements at
another event like last week's Computex
it's always huge news and dominates the
coverage cycle for at least a full day
or two we see this at least once a year
so they'll often host their own launch
events separately until decided to start
pushing X 299 at Computex this year
right alongside and these X 399 and we
encountered a unique behavior no one
really watched the X 299 coverage we'll
talk about why today before getting to
that this coverage is brought to you by
Corsairs new at t1 race chair which is a
$350 gaming targeted chair using a
bucket style race seat the chair arms
have four directional movement for
configuration to your liking and has a
bonus they use rollerblade wheels
learn more at the link in the
description below we already criticized
Intel and it's marketing language in our
initial coverage of the x-series CPUs
for example when they use the phrases
extreme mega tasking in marketing slides
or self cannibalize their own product
lines like the non-case cube part
claiming that case keys are required for
VR gaming that was all discussed as was
the requirement of the new x-series CPUs
for 12k gaming we talked about all that
but the coverage still did pretty well
and looking at the comments most of you
agreed with us or if not agreeing
directly with us you were still voicing
concerns about the new product line and
about X 299 and X series of parts
specifically normally like KB like X
which we'll talk about in a separate
video
so there's a lot of criticism going on
with Intel right now but still you would
expect follow-up coverage like X to 99
to do decently under any normal
circumstances and by normal we're mostly
looking at the past several years of
product launches but there's a few big
differences this year from those
previous launches one of which of course
is and these presents in the market now
with CPUs especially really shaking
things up for Intel sort of walk through
some of that there are a couple of other
items that also we think affected the
viability of coverage of X to 99 parts
and caused us to change our publication
priorities in the middle of Computex to
make sure that the high
performing items were published first
one of the first videos we shot was our
X $2.99 motherboard coverage at
gigabytes suite and that was prioritized
for media publication because of the
good viewership on our initial x-series
product announcement video the video
that gigabyte x99 motherboard walked
through only garnered around 12,000
views total since publication last week
and at first publication we were sitting
at around 6,000 views one hour then new
kenton card teardown which was a day
older was doing more than 30,000 it was
doing significantly more per hour which
are all stats that we look at to provide
some perspective on how we shoot a show
like Computex to really make sure
everyone understands what the process is
like behind the scenes so at copy decks
we might shoot something like four or
five videos in a day maybe upwards of
six but often tapers out around four or
five and then we obviously have a
limited amount of time left in the day
for editing those videos and for getting
them onto YouTube so at that point we
face another challenge how many videos
do we push onto the YouTube algorithm
before we lose faith in its ability to
distribute them all and still get decent
viewership across all videos because
obviously you don't want to load
everyone down with a whole bunch of
videos all at once if YouTube is not
actually going to distribute those and
make sure there's even viewership so
that's a concern as is time so that
means that we have to prioritize things
now going into a show just leaning on
experience for one doing this for almost
10 years now you lean on experience to
figure out what should perform well and
you also look at trends in the industry
and part of this is looking at
competitions so we might look at what
other people that you watch are
publishing and then decide from there
okay these are doing well for them these
aren't doing well for them well shuffle
our priorities and make sure that the
things that perform the best go up the
soonest because you need to make ROI on
a really expensive trip obviously but
you also want to make sure that you're
covering stuff as a creator or a
journalist or whatever early enough in
the process that it's still relevant to
everyone in this trip that seems like it
would obviously be X to 99 and as soon
as we learned it was going to be on the
show X 3 99 those seemed like the very
clear winners in terms of good
viewership and what happened was we
actually ended up pushing cases ahead of
X to 99
explain why in a moment which cases
always do pretty okay but they do okay
almost regardless of when we publish
them because cases just kind of have a
really reliable and kind of predictable
viewership where people will pick it up
over time whereas something like a new
CPU or a new GPU has a really limited
window where it's interesting to
everyone and then it falls off because
all the information available to the
product has been disseminated up until
the point where you just are waiting for
a review to get more information so
going into the show expecting X 299 to
perform well meant that we encountered
something a bit different than expected
obviously we have case coverage that did
better than X 299 videos we even had a
vlog do two times more views on some of
our X two nine nine videos and we never
do vlogs and our content was exactly in
line with all of our other coverage so
that wasn't it either as soon as we were
able to get gigabytes to let us film the
X 299 board we ran over there got the
video shot and online within an hour so
if though minutes and that content piece
has now done double of what the gigabyte
$2.99 video did publish a bit before the
X 399 video and the 399 video was only
one motherboard here's a look at stones
view stats for X to 99 and X 399 the
public numbers this gives an idea for
the popularity trend between them and
shows us something that we started
noticing for Intel earlier this year
their new stuff just isn't as popular
that started with KB Lake and it's
continuing here and we think that's for
a few reasons
and before rolling into though is just
to kind of give some more context this
video is supposed to help you understand
one what we kind of look at behind the
scenes when we're making content because
it's kind of interesting but to look at
why X 299 is just not that popular for
this coverage cycle compared to normally
in fact it was bad enough that
originally our plan was everything X to
99 and what we could get of x3 99 when
we learned it was there goes up first
and as soon as that first gigabyte X to
99 video hit
I told Keegan okay all that stuff I said
about X to 99 forget it it waits till
the end of the show we'll publish
Coolermaster first publish the MSI
laptop stuffers all the other videos you
saw on our Channel those moved
head of the msi x-29 coverage I was
published later ACS $2.99 and whatever
else you may have talked about to the
point where we ended up as soon as
gigabyte X 399 1 5 ee 99 as fast as
possible because we saw the viewership
what's quite good so the reason for that
I think there's a few there's a few
theories here that are valid for this
one of them is that I think people might
just be bored of Intel and the reason
for that is because you look at Intel's
performance over the last several years
is not news to anyone they generally
have a pretty predictable performance
weep of maybe five to seven percent in
something like gaming FPS maybe you get
some more out of single-threaded
performance or some really specific
application but for our audience you're
expecting five seven percent certainly
not any more than ten when overclocked
and things like that so for that reason
it's easy to see why people might be
bored of Intel because they might just
expect well I know the performance of X
99 and it's CPUs so I can kind of figure
out what X to 99 and it's CPUs will look
like as well
that's one potential reason this might
be contributing to the limp readership
in X to 99 where everyone sort of thinks
they know what to expect which is valid
and then the other end of the possible
theories of why performance is lower on
$2.99 versus almost everything else is
that AMD has been stealing some of Intel
Thunder lately Intel has not had to
compete in a long time in fact I think
that they have forgotten how to compete
in some ways you look at their recent
marketing materials for the upcoming
CPUs that kind of tells you why but ambi
is now putting pressure on them in
multiple markets and the main one that's
interesting for now is thread Ripper
because suddenly h EDT is challenged and
intel hasn't faced that for a very long
period of time at this point and so the
big thing there is that because Intel is
being challenged it means that
viewership is going to be more split
people have a finite amount of time to
watch things if they're interested in
AMD and X 399 they might not watch Intel
and X 299 they are not necessarily
mutually exclusive or crossover
audiences so that's part of the
challenge to this
coverage the viewership of the coverage
I should say is being pulled away from
Intel and some of these markets and to
be fair thread Ripper looks quite
interesting for this one versus a GDP
from Intel so we're definitely and we'll
be testing and reviewing both stay tuned
for all that but it's it's a pretty
clear path that they're going down in
terms of competition between the two
companies now another thing that we saw
that's interesting and kind of
potentially hurts or helps Andy it's
hard to tell exactly depending on what
you're posting as a creator or
journalists or reporter and that one
other thing is we saw a few comments for
people to ask things like and it's
completely fair to ask then it X 399
just come out why are you talking about
X 299 and that's where it's interesting
because AMD decided clearly to name
their processors or their chipsets
things that were somewhat relatable to
Intel the incumbents devices so with
chipsets you get X 399 clearly it's
after X 299 Intel wasn't going to use it
anyway because if you look at their
naming schemes 58 $79.99 and they're
going to skip 100 and go to 299 so
they're probably go to 499 would be the
next guess but not use 399 so Andy took
that spot and then Andy also did there
be there X 370 and there be Series
boards that are similar in name number
especially to Intel's B Series boards so
it creates some interesting confusion
but also means that AMD immediately has
a part in the market where people can
look at it knowing Intel for five years
now or more knowing Intel stuff they can
look at Andy and say I understand what
that is and where it falls in the
products back and how it should perform
and what features it should provide
based on my knowledge of these other
things that I've been using for years so
that makes it easy to make a linear
transform sort of between one company or
the other but it also means that for
newcomers to the market they have a
challenge of I don't know what any of
this stuff means I haven't built the
system in seven years or whatever so 399
looks like the newest the highest number
it's in the X series why are we talking
about
that's one thing that's potentially
helping Andy it could also hurt their
viewership though because we have to
specifically use the word thread Ripper
in either thumbnails or titles to make
sure that people didn't confuse the two
we didn't want people for example seeing
x-29 Intel coverage and expecting all X
Blanc 99 to be Intel if they were
actually interested in AMD safe to make
sure there's not a chance to miss read
one very important number in the title
and skip the video because they don't
want to see it because they're not
interested in Intel so you name it X 299
thread Ripper or put the title and the
thumbnail or something like that so
there's all really interesting stuff
it's kind of behind the scenes look the
biggest thing I wanted to point out was
that for the first time in a very long
time we're seeing really interesting
performance metrics in terms of views
where a for-sure guaranteed high view
count item a motherboard and a new
platform launch and a new CPU launch is
not necessarily the best performing
thing there's one outlier here our
deleting coverage of the 7900 X was by
far our best coverage from the show but
that's that had a few things going for
one we deleted a processor that's not
released but that helps a lot - we had
their Bower in the video featuring their
Bower in the title that helps brand
viewership and then three we criticized
them selves for the Tim usage kind of
questioned why solder isn't used to
spoke to their Bower certainly an expert
in it so that also gets interest so
that's the outlier we're okay it's a
much different type of content than
anything else that we shot at the show
so it'll perform well but the other
stuff not so much I mean we have I view
numbers here
HD six to ninety nine eighty five
hundred views as of this filming MSI 299
seventy one hundred gigabyte X 299 and
that's the interesting one to be shot
two gigabyte things was about twelve
thousand gigabyte X 399 20,000 and a CX
399 21,000 so for Asus that's 8500 to
21,000 and both of them were one
motherboard featured and they're both
flagships gigabyte
was 12 to 20,000 as of right now and the
gigabyte one was a roundup of all their
x-29 and boards versus the one 399 and
to be fair that was somewhat exclusive
when we first filmed it because we were
just among the earliest to see the board
but you get the idea so I think that
kind of gives a behind-the-scenes look
it's to two parts this video one you get
a behind-the-scenes look at how we do
these conventions because we don't
normally talk about it I don't think a
lot of people do you're so focused on
getting the content out you don't really
care to talk about how you're getting
the content made and how you prioritize
things and things like that but - it
also shows that there's a pretty
interesting market brewing between Intel
and AMD where Intel now is facing the
normal level of criticism for things
that they do but they are also facing
some heat because Andy can come in and
take advantage of that those criticized
aspects of Intel to hed t line as I said
in the news announcement 4 X $2.99 on
the new CPUs X 3 CPUs Intel should have
if they have the opportunity to double
down on things like the 77 Hart K which
they are still uncontested there for
people who want the highest possible FPS
gaming platform if you're doing 144
Hertz or something they have they have
competition but it's not as good as the
7700 K and they start struggling once
you look at production as we talked
about in all the reviews or double down
on the G 45 60 where they're also doing
really well because MD has no r3 yet and
the r3 might not be as cheap at the 45
60 instead or I guess one more
alternative fix the i-5 lines that it
makes more sense price-wise and
performance wise instead what they've
done is double down on h EDT because
that stuff is all made so it can
normally is made for about 18 months by
the time you buy it or in the process of
being made I should say they double down
on that and now they're facing thread
Ripper which is what rise and performs
well in so interesting market let us
know your thoughts below on all this and
why you would prioritize
watching one video versus another like
if I gave you an option and we put X 2 9
9 X 399 and a case video in front of you
and you can watch - which - do you watch
right now if you only have time today so
that's what I'm curious about
