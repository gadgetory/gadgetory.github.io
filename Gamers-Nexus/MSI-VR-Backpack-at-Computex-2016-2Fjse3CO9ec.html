computex coverage over the next few days
but we saw plenty of stuff to work on
including today's quick report on the
msi vr backpack and a couple of
companies have V our backpacks this time
around but a messiah is one of the first
along with asus to debut the technology
in a semi real form before getting to
that all this coverage is brought to you
by roseville and their new Cullinan case
which uses tempered glass side panels so
with this backpack first of all the
target price is not finalized but it
just to get it out of the way
immediately they are aiming at the 2,000
ish dollar range and it will maximally
sell upwards of five grand depending on
the SKU in it so that stated now that
we've got the money understood the VR
backpacks entire purpose is to eliminate
wires with VR so as many of you know
just from watching tech reviews or maybe
some of you have tried it there's the VR
tether sort of a tether of cables that
runs down the back your head and it
normally kind of gets in the way as you
walk around at playing with something
like the HTC vive so these backpacks are
trying to eliminate that I'm personally
not a hundred percent sure how viable I
think the idea is but they're definitely
all trying and it is something to at
least talk about so the thing is
equipped with a custom motherboard it's
not a laptop like we saw with Intel
previously at CES is a custom
motherboard and it uses an MX am a car
that's the type of semi modular GPU that
you would find in a high on the laptop
so the MXM cards on this particular msi
vr backpack used the gtx 980 not the
nine ATM by the 980 and they are looking
towards the 1080 and possibly the 1070
in the near future potentially before
actual launch because it's not a real
product just yet the backpack itself
weighs 5 kilograms right now so around
10 pounds and it's supposed to wait less
by the entry to production its weight is
derived primarily from the use of all
aluminum for the backpack but other
materials like plastics and things like
that will be introduced to the final
model and of course it's got normal
backpack straps on it but otherwise is
all aluminum right now most of the
weight comes from the batteries so it's
got to gtat batteries in it these are
the batteries found in ms
is mechanical keyboard equipped laptop
the huge gtat Titan or whatever it's
called the four thousand dollar laptops
with two batteries from that thing a
total of twenty-four cells in the
lithium-ion batteries and rated for 60
to 90 minutes of VR gameplay actual
gaming with quote unquote five hours of
normal use I'm not really sure what
exactly that means because to me
normally use is gaming but I guess if
you're using it for sort of 2d desktop
type applications then that would be
longer use the rest of this so we said
custom motherboard MXM video card it is
Wireless that's the main thing and then
it's got two fans so one fan as intake I
think 120 millimeters that's on one side
of the backpack one is exhaust on the
other side blows through hits the card
cools down and that's pretty much all
there is for air and cooling right now
that we know about requires about 60
minutes to charge the two batteries in
there battery is pretty easily swappable
so in theory msi will be selling
additional battery packs or i guess you
probably use something else out there
but you'll need an additional battery if
you want to do more than an hour of
gaming at a time without a charging
session in between you still have to
shut down of course to switch the
battery but it can charge while plain
released target second half of 2016
there's yet no name and the immediate
competitors are asus check out our Intel
coverage from CES so our backpack on the
channel you'll find that and I believe
there's another company as well it's
going to be our backpack but as a
product i'll throw in a quick opinion
here vr many of you know what I think of
that already but as a product we are
backpacks I'm it's kinda it's not quite
there yet it's an interesting concept
it's a very good idea because one of the
biggest limiters of the VR is that
mobility and the lack of it it's a
little bit dangerous in some of the
demos people tripping and things like
that but 60 to 90 minutes yeah it's a
long time in VR still not quite there
yet and that will of course increase the
lifespan of the plate play time will
increase as these gpus and CPUs lower
their TDP so that's all for the msi vr
backpack at computex 2016 check back
shortly for roundups from the show
including
best video card roundups and things like
that cases some other stuff we saw the
show thank you for watching as always
patreon link the post your video if you
want to help us out directly i'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
