Nexus Donna it is currently five a.m.
where i am recording this room right now
which is the past because you are
listening to this in the future so it's
like run to alternate realities i'm
doing a new installment of a heat
signature which is released every
saturday and heat signature basically
covers the lesser-known games the non
forefront games and last week we talked
about cube world which is a super
awesome game check it out it's in the
related videos check that out after this
one this week we're talking about
choplifter HD which i think is fairly
new it came out january 11 that looks
like and i just thought of pop up on my
Steam feed when I had some DLC come out
that is free so i decided i would check
it out and the game itself is only ten
dollars so it was an easy choice and
easy game to pick up it is choplifter is
a side-scrolling 2.5 dimensional if i'm
a helicopter rescue game sort of like
the older games it is basically
side-scrolling you shoot the enemies you
dodge their bullets you refuel your tank
you can change altitude change speed you
can shoot missiles shoot normal
machine-gun bullets and the goal of the
game is to rescue civilians that are
stranded or drop off military personnel
that need to go where they're going and
the game is based in a war zone it is
pretty pretty standard in terms of
arcade-style games now where it gets
cool though is the 2.5 d i mentioned
we're with the helicopter you can
actually rotate to be facing towards you
out of the monitor so towards us or
facing the other way if you swivel it
fast enough and what that does is it
lets you aim to foreground you that's
not just the the same level background
as your helicopter units so so you're
you can aim at actually units that are
basically closer to you or farther away
from you on in the actual depth of the
screen not just width and that's what
makes it cool and makes it stand out
there's a very simple game as I said but
it's a great game to kill maybe three or
four hours I probably wouldn't put that
much time into it in one go because
you'll burn out really fast it's not all
that it's not gonna hold your attention
attended all that long it is maybe a
total of I don't know it's hard to say
probably four hours to
x depending on what kind of gamer you
are of total gameplay you might get a
little bit more if you're really into
the downloadable content because they do
release a lot of it and so far I believe
two of them have been free the other uh
looks like let's see here looks like two
of them have been free and the others
were all 99 cents each really isn't that
bad so for the most part you get
different types of choppers and they are
equipped with different types of of
attributes as normal so you can have
more fuel or fit more passengers or
stuff like that and of course there are
different levels as you keep playing and
and one of the cooler things is recent
DLC added a zombie level which where we
probably all had a bit enough of zombies
at this point I'm kind of getting sick
of them myself but this game does a
really good job of it it really actually
reminds me a lot of zombie driver which
i'm considering covering and another one
of these heats and your episodes but for
those that aren't aware zombie driver is
basically a not side-scrolling it's a
top-down arcade racing game where you
drive and kill zombies really hard
that's that so this game has a zombie
level where there is Ombey is that are
attacking a town and they're besieging
this by the state villagers I've been
playing a lot of older games lately
they're besieging the citizens and you
go down there you rescue them you blow
up zombies you shoot your missiles and
take them out in big chunks at a time by
the dozens if you can and it's all very
a very non serious very fun very basic
and it's really just it's the perfect
game as I said to kill some time on a
Saturday or something to that extent
choplifter HD isn't an extremely
challenging game it does have some very
difficult levels though but for the most
part is fairly average in terms of
gaming difficulty when compared against
other types of games that most of us
listening to this or casting this in my
case play so it is not super challenging
but it is is a relative difficulty if
you get into the later levels and if you
restrict yourself with usage of weapons
so that's a they're definitely a lot of
options there for expanding the play and
for helping it live on especially with
this DLC and actually the game has
really impressive voice acting it's not
like it's the most resonant or the most
impressive voices in the world they
don't have the golden voice or anything
like that but the voice acting itself is
really well scripted it has great
one-liners actually the pilot reminds me
a lot of Johnny Bravo of all people and
and there's some really good banter back
and forth between the pilot and either
the copilot or for the guy in the base
he's he's basically another guy in the
background but some good banter a lot of
funny jokes a lot of one-liners and and
I suppose they get old if play it for 20
hours but for the short kind of game it
is it really won't won't be one of those
games where you start where you to mute
the sound because like that it is it's
pretty solid there's really not a whole
lot more to say the video tells it all
for the most part like I said the cool
part is that you can rotate your career
chopper and shoot out towards you or out
in different directions and then the
whole dynamic where you basically land
your chopper you have to be careful kill
all the enemies surrounding the area
clear out the area just like black hawk
down or something there's some kind of
mission and once you've cleared out the
area and enough you can land you can
still shoot while you're landed so we
can cover your your citizens as they're
boarding and then once you've covered
them once enough of them have gotten on
you can take off and bring them to the
helipad where they're rescued at which
point you go out again and you rescue
some more and that's good game and in
the zombie level which is dlc so it's
not the whole game but in the zombie
level there are some cool extra elements
like the zombies can grab onto your
chopper and paint onto it and you got to
shake them off by whipping your chopper
around to do the 2.5 d view in the
normal 2d view and use your booster and
run into objects intentionally and all
kinds of stuff like that to shake the
zombies off because you won't always
have a chance to kill them all while the
rest scream rescuing people because of
course it is important not to land on
people which I may or may not have done
several times and started as a result of
it but anyway it's a pretty good game
check it out it's called choplifter HD
is currently on steam like I said if
it's not your kind of game you know skip
it it's only a ten-dollar game it's not
going to be a world of difference event
big picture but it is a good game to
kill some time especially if you really
enjoy some
arcade-style games if you really enjoy
side-scrollers and if you're just in
general interested in the Unreal Engine
or in the other applications of the
Unreal Engine or again interested in
this whole 2.5 d thing and it is a
simple game it is single player on this
team for ten dollars if there's anything
else I can tell you about it five DLC
options currently available most of them
are just extra choppers though but it
does prove that the developers active so
that means there will be more in the
future which makes me excited excited
about the feature of this game so I I
have had enough stumbling over my words
it is now 506 am and I'm gonna sign off
for now so i will talk to you guys next
time look forward to the next heat
signature which I'm trying to decide I
might talk about the voxel based RTS
known as Castle story which I covered in
the recent article or I might even do
some more I might do a secret project
that one of my friends has developed it
is called I'm not gonna tell you cuz
it's a secret project but stay tuned
there will be another one next Saturday
just like always and that is all for
heat signature</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
