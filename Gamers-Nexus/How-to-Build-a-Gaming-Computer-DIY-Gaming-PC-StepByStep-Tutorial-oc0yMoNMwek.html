Nexus Tana and I am joined by hardware
editor Patrick Stone hello jian and
today we're doing a video on how to
build a computer we have all the guides
of the parts to use but haven't actually
talked about how to properly assemble it
so that's what this video is for and
first off there are three main
requirements for building a system so
you need a screw driver
that's number one this is a screw driver
and then two you need the parts so we
have all the parts here and we actually
have full build listings in the
description below if you need help
finding compatible parts if you're
uncomfortable picking them yourself and
then three ideally not required but
seriously recommended is an ESD wrist
strap and what can you tell us about
electrostatic discharge well so the the
ESD is basically bad news for your
expensive components if you don't want
to trash the stuff that you just spent a
bunch of time choosing and paying for
then this is what you need and really
these guys are super cheap five or six
dollars so I guess super low in price
not actually cheap and what it does is
it takes the static electricity off of
you sends it to a ground and what that
does is it prevents it from going from
you to the board or from you to the CPU
sends it from you to the ground and
here's the idea behind that these
components on here are working at 3.3
volts 5 volts 12 volts let CPU down like
1 volt you know plus or minus a quarter
or whatever right and if you can
actually touch the component or whatever
it is up here and feel a static shock
the same as if it works like a cold
winter day and you touch the door handle
then you've released somewhere around
2500 volts
you do the math 12 versus 25 hundred
dead board okay Dez dead yeah there you
go
Steve finishing all fours so we're
actually we're just going to get started
building this not waste any time for our
parts and I have a list of this below if
you need some help choosing a high on
system I'm going to start with the NZXT
phantom 530 provided by NZXT it is a mid
tower case and will fit everything we
have here ATX form factor is important
to know the CPU is an i7 4770k
which we can easily overclocked we're
using the stock cooler
this for tutorial purposes I would
strongly recommend an aftermarket cooler
we have several guys on that below
motherboard that the CPU goes into is an
MSI z87 g45 gaming board in a red and
black board with a z87 chipset for
overclocking and other features provided
by an tech we have a high current pro
power supply 1300 watts with a 80 plus
platinum ranking so it is a seriously
efficient power supply provided by
Kingston we have HyperX predator memory
which is stock clocked at 21 33
megahertz easily overclocked the SSD is
a Samsung 840 SSD and this one is 250
gigabytes so we're going to use that we
have a generic hard drive and and then
for the video card we have an EVGA GTX
760 of course by Nvidia so throughout
the build process be sure to reference
all the links in the description below I
have a ton of resources for you
including a full article guide on this
process with a ton of smaller tips and
cable management tips component
selection tips PC builds and our support
forums which are always free to ask a
question so we're just going to get
started I would generally suggest
building your system outside of the case
first because if you get a
dead-on-arrival component do a component
your board doesn't work your power
supply is dead you don't want to go
through all the time of putting it in
there and find it out so we're just
going to start with building basically
mount the CPU the cooler the RAM and
basic connections and once we know it
works we'll put it in the case okay so
now we are going to move to building the
system outside of the case and one of
the things you guys want to be aware of
is ESD or electrostatic discharge we
rigged up something here if you're not
sure about what we're doing here then
don't do this safety first right but
once we've made sure we're ESD safe
we're going to move into installing the
CPU we're going to remove this lever and
pull the gate up and now that's going to
give us access to the CPU socket once
we've done that we're going to take a
look at the CPU find this little golden
arrow head corner and then we're also
going to look at the notches which are
towards the backside of the CPU we're
going to use those elbows orient the CP
you as we lay it into the socket and I
do mean lay it in there shouldn't take
any force at all you just be able to
turn it over drop it in there and then
begin closing the gate the gate really
should go down very easily just make
sure you get underneath that little
screw that is on the motherboard and
then once the gates down it will take a
good bit of force to push the lever back
into place so just push it back down and
don't panic if it takes a little bit of
force as long as you install the CPU
without any extra force than necessary
then you're good to go and at this point
we are ready to install the CPU cooler
so we're using the crappy Intel stock
cooler indeed and aftermarket options
good check our links in the description
below for those for the stock cooler you
just line up the cold plate directly
over the CPU and then we've got the four
screws that line up with the holes on
the board we're going to just go ahead
and snap these guys in just make sure
that the arrows aren't pointing directly
at the CPU cooler if you're using this
Intel stock one and you'll feel a really
really good snap as they click in and
that's going to let you know that it is
on there and it's definitely making
great contact with the CPUs integrated
heat spreader yeah and once it's locked
in place we just have to connect the PWM
fan pin to the board so make sure you're
using the CPU pen not a system fan pin
out and that connects up near the
heatsink on this board toward the top
and now we're ready to move on to RAM so
with the CPU heatsink fully connected
Ram you just really drop it in same idea
we have these lashes that we're going to
open up and then line up the pins on the
bottom of the module with the pins on
the receiving side and push it in to
place it should snap into place there
shouldn't be any undue force necessary
and once you hear that snap the latches
will close on their own and that's how
you know that it's good to go and you
may be wondering how we knew which slots
to put it in if you're only going to use
two modules on a four module motherboard
like this one you're going to have to
refer to the motherboard manual and it's
going to tell you which module slots if
you want to
insert it in so as you're doing that
insertion just just make sure that the
notch lines up with the the slot
properly and it's important for for dual
channel functionality and other features
to make sure using the correct slots -
exactly right and some boards will show
those labeled on the board so finally we
need a video card if you don't have
onboard video supported by the
motherboard that's pretty easy drop it
into the PCI Express slot it will snap
into place just like everything else and
and then if you don't need if you have
onboard video and your CPU supports it
don't even bother with the video card
right now unless you want to test it so
we are going to plug in some power we
just need the CPU powered only eight pin
up near the CPU we need 24-pin power
near the RAM and then we need the video
card power if necessary once all of
those are connected again pretty easy
we're just going to jump the power
switch header on the board where your
switch would plug into some boards we'll
have an on button built into them you
can just hit that so to jump it you just
take a screwdriver and check your manual
for which one is the power switch that
would normally PWR underscore SW check
for that pin out and then bridge it with
the screwdriver and your system will
turn on as we see here and you'll note
that I've forgotten to you know turn the
power supply on first that's certainly a
necessary beginning step but that this
is true and plug it in don't forget to
plug it in and at this point it should
turn on so we are ready to move the
board into the case the only thing you
have to do is remove the power remove
the video card and then we will
reinstall those items once it's mounted
in the case so if we're installing your
power supply we're just going to drop it
in your fan should be facing ideally the
bottom of the case if it is a bottom
mounted power supply drop it into the
slot there's a hole right there hit the
four screws and and that's it before
installing the motherboard we want to
mount the i/o panel shield which just
basically goes in the back to stop stuff
from falling in do this before the
motherboards installed line it up pop it
in to the spot in the back of the case
and now we can install the motherboard
before installing the motherboard though
make sure you have your stand
installed in the case you can see their
pre-installed on this phantom 5:30
if not then put them in the appropriate
ATX or em ATX slots so here we're
dropping it in the cpu stay is toward
the top of the case line up your i/o
with the i/o panel in the back and
that's really it make sure your
standoffs are lined up with the screw
holes screw em all in don't leave any
unscrewed for shorting purposes and and
then we can move on to the drives okay
the next thing we're going to do is
we're going to go ahead and install the
optical drive the optical drives it
could take screws at these points right
here but not a big deal now all you got
to do is reach inside the case pop out
the filler plate these ones on this NZXT
case just kind of have a little spring
load and then it's all tooless now
there's no screws anymore so you just
kind of lift up the release lever like
that slide your drive in and you're done
yeah and then pop the release lever down
and now we can move on to the solid
state drive and hard drive
alright so like Steve said we're going
to move on to the solid-state drive the
Samsung 840 250 gig and this guy just
mounts with these screw holes here
lining up with these schools here so
that it will stay nice and steady like
this and then this guy this hard disk
drive is completely toolless you just
use these little prongs right here to
snap it to the screw holes here and here
and that's all there is to it and make
sure your power connectors are facing
out otherwise you have to redo it and
next we are going to move on I believe
to the cables we have everything in now
so we're just going straight to cables
we'll route them through the holes and
then do the video card last all right so
if you have a modular power supply now
you can connect your cables to the power
supply if not then you are good to go
for this part basically just make sure
you're looking for the 24 pin connector
on the power supply the 8 pin for the
CPU and then your pin outs for the video
card depending on how powerful the video
card is and then of course your SATA
connections and if relevant the molex
connections and next it's time to manage
the cables from your power supply and
your front panel connectors so I have a
full guide on that link to the
description below it's a pretty popular
video so hit that if you need help
with specific cable management tips in
general just route the cable through the
closest halt try to stretch the cable
out as much as possible and minimize the
amount of cable length that's inside the
case this will reduce the chance of
inhibiting air flow and keep dust out of
your case which also can damage
components down the line so we're just
going to cut through that and then it's
time to mount the video card what we
have here is GG X 760 from EVGA it's
going to go into the PCI Express at 16
and it's pretty simple install just kind
of line it up first with the outside of
the case drop in that edge and then just
let it slowly drop in give it a nice
little tap and then you'll put these two
thumb screws in right here and then
install the power connectors you'll see
that we have an eight pin and a six pin
our nice power supply has a little bit
of both
so we'll line those up and install those
as well once you have all the cables
routed through the pastor's you need to
connect them to the board and the
components so we have a 24 pin power
connector that's board sight that's
pretty obvious on the right side of the
board right of the CPU just plug that in
we have an 8 pin CPU connector top left
normally right near the CPU and also
known as the EPS connector and then of
course we have your video card power
connectors depending on how powerful the
video card is you might have a few of
those the front panel connectors on the
bottom are for your USB or USB 2.0 if
you have it
LEDs power switches stuff like that
check your manual for where those go on
the motherboard because it is different
for a couple motherboards and finally HD
audio in the bottom left for your front
panel audio and I think that covers all
of our connectors other than obviously
the drives you plug those in drive size
pretty straightforward with the SATA
power M SATA data cables and you see if
one of the things that you were
mentioning to me earlier when we were
doing the build was that some people may
not have a built-in fan controller on
their system and if that's the case then
you're going to use your onboard fan
connectors it looks just like the one
that we showed you earlier on the CPU
you're just going to find them all
throughout the board and that's an easy
plug and play there and you can actually
control those speeds through BIOS if
they bother you can drop
the 50% and reduce the noise yeah I
guess it last but not least now as you
got your system built and you got
looking the way you want it to look the
last thing you really want to do is run
a burnin test what that's going to do is
just push your pusher components to peak
load so that you can make sure that
they're going to work at peak load for
as long as possible pretty much if you
can make them fail at peak load now
they're going to fill up peak load later
and if you can't make them fail at peak
load now they're probably going to last
you a good long time check out the guide
down link below yep we have a guide for
that of course if you have any trouble
throughout the entire process if you
need help picking components or testing
or whatever determining what's broken if
it doesn't boot then check out our
forums we have free support of course
and that's that's it for this guide so
let us know in the comments below or
preferably on our page since YouTube is
using Google+ now and I don't understand
how it works
we'll see us a comment somewhere on the
internet and tell me what you want to
see for the next video and we will see
you all next time peace literal</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
