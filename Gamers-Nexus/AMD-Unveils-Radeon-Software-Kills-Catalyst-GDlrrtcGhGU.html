dotnet and today we're talking out and
these latest update which is Radeon
software so this updates pretty major
retires the catalyst control center
which is and these long-standing more
than ten year software suite for its AMD
Radeon GPUs and this actually was
created under a TI before they and the
acquisition so that is no more catalyst
will go away and the new software suite
is called Radeon software and just to
clear things away straight off the bat
the software comes under a few different
names so you'll see this referred to as
different things by different media
outlets today and the actual software is
just called Radeon software you'll also
see it called crimson edition and this
is the major iteration for the current
version of radeon software they are not
different things so Radeon software
comes in crimson edition for this year
it might have a different iteration next
year and he hopes to do major iterations
annually and those will all be labeled
as different shades of red so you have
crimson this year finally for the
software there's the Year dot month
identifier so if it's released in 2015
November it would be Radeon software
crimson edition 15 dot 11 which is
actually pretty clear once you
understand the naming structure of a
doll that said it is also important to
clear off straight away that this is not
a driver update so this is strictly a
software side update by AMD and there
will not be driver performance
improvements with this software package
there might be driving performance
improvements for other reasons like new
drivers but it's not just from updating
to the software so this is coming out
soon it's not out just yet it should be
out within a few weeks we're told but
definitely within quarter for of 2015 is
the official statement from AMD and the
major improvements for the software are
an updated you I towards a minimalist
design Andy has completely overhauled
their long-standing catalyst you I so
that it is more of a modern look and
fits sort of the windows user interface
design
and the trend lately the software boots
in about 0.6 seconds from what we're
told and that's compared against the
eight second boot time of catalyst
control centers are quite a big speed
increase Radeon software also now ads
per game profiling of overclocks which
actually I think is the coolest thing
added to the software and I hope that
other companies will follow suit like
Nvidia with its GeForce experience so
the cool thing with the overclocking
software is that overdrive already
exists it's not really that powerful I
actually much prefer afterburner to
overdrive but with overdrive Andy is now
allowing per game overclock so if you
want to just overclock your GPU for GTA
5 because GTA 5 stresses the GPU more
than dota or League of Legends then you
can do that and the use case advantage
to this overclocking solution is you're
not stressing the GPU one hundred
percent of the time when it doesn't need
to be so overclocks as many of you know
can be detrimental to the silicon's
health and will degrade its longevity
over time so you want to be as easy on
the overclocks as possible but if an
overclock is necessary to improve game
performance to the point that it pushes
you to 60 FPS or 120 FPS or what have
you then you can apply it just to that
game and this is a pretty cool feature
the next big change is one click
eyefinity configuration so I affinities
been a bit of a mess through the AMD
catalyst control center but with radeon
software the company has made it so you
can click once it'll automatically
detect sort find and arrange all of your
monitors connected to your multi monitor
and the GPU system and that's it you're
pretty much done there's of course
custom tuning as always if you wanted to
do tuning of your own but it should be
more intelligent with sorting the multi
monitor I finiti solutions now the big
thing with radeon software is that it is
a statement from AMD and the asain and
actually said directly in our call with
them that they're taking software
seriously an hour extremely seriously to
use their words and this is in response
to reviews and complaints online where
their GP us have actually had not bad
architecture like Fiji is pretty
impressive architecture as we
in our review but seriously
underperformed the price was not right
on the fury ax and it was just a
software issue overall in a driver's
issue of course the architecture is
limited in some ways but it is actually
impressive overall so it should be able
to compete Andy wants to update its
software so that it is in competition
directly with Nvidia's huge GeForce
experience push and it also of course
has taken drivers more seriously going
forward but again this is not a driver
update this is strictly a software
update so that said Radeon software will
allow one click driver downloads into
installation through the software suite
and as sort of a subtle slam to nvidia's
recent update to GFE Radeon software
does not require email registration or
account creation in order to download
these drivers and the also said very
explicitly that it will still allow
standalone driver downloads through the
AMD website so if you don't want Radeon
software at all you want to completely
off your system you can still get the
latest downloads and drivers through the
site without Radeon software raptor
gaming evolved is still here to stay
this is not a departure of the raptor
gaming evolved application and I'll be
up front here I don't like gaming
evolved I don't like the Raptor
application because it feels bloated
it's a little slow to boot and it's just
kind of unnecessary for for the way I
use a computer it doesn't mean it's bad
it just means I don't like it so with
that stated with that plainly put out
there the Raptor software is still here
it will plug in directly to the Radeon
software for game specific settings
tweaking which is something that this
Raptor solution already does so if you
want to set up per game settings and
control it all through a single software
suite you can still do that you can do
that now through Radeon software when
it's released and that will be tied in
with raptor gaming evolved so if you opt
out of gaming evolved you lose this
functionality but you still have the
functionality to global profiles if you
want to globally disabled vsync or
something like that you can do that
through the radeon software suite now
again i personally just go into each
game settings when I first launch it
because i find that fun it's a fun part
of the game to me and i set up the
settings there
so that's how I use it I'm sure a lot of
people don't really like that aspect of
gaming and would rather just launch it
and go and in that case then the global
profiles are worth using overall this is
a major step in the right direction for
Andy and actually it's a series and a
number of steps in the right direction
Fiji as i said was an impressive
architecture but it just wasn't good
enough and unfortunately for AMD being
not quite good enough is a major problem
for them right now because that's a
consistent problem and the company is in
financial jeopardy so there's a very
serious reason for them to get moving
and take software and drivers seriously
because most reviews have complained
about drivers as the main hold up for a
purchase of an AMD GPU as Andy continues
in this direction I hope that the GPUs
and the drivers will become more stable
and there's already a pretty strong
priced argument for a lot of the GPS
like the 382 390 they are competitively
priced but the the biggest reason that I
would sometimes feel uncomfortable
recommending them for certain games is
the stability and is the ease of use of
software both of these things are being
addressed by Andy the drivers and the
stability have been actively addressed
for the last few months following a
180-day hiatus from wickel driver
updates and speaking to that note and
the promised on the call that they're
hoping to deliver somewhere around six
wickel driver updates per year so that's
again an improvement over the last year
or so and they're hoping to do a couple
major software iterations going forward
so hopefully this is all stuff that the
company can actually deliver on the
software is not yet available we don't
even have a press version of it so I'll
be sure to update everyone as soon as we
have it in the hand but you can check

below for the screenshots for more
information for all that stuff if you

you think your friends would get some
