hardcore overclocking and today we're
gonna be taking a look at gigabytes X
570 flagship the gigabyte X 570 horas
extreme and I'm a huge fan of this
motherboard like this is one of those
motherboards where it's like I want this
just because of the vrm that's on there
because this is the first motherboard
ever to have a true 14 plus two-phase
vrm before that this video is brought to
you by ethernal takes ring duo 12
radiator fans the ring duo 12 fan kit
comes with three a RGB 120mm fans with a
controller and each fan equipped with 18
LEDs and a diffuser for a glowing color
inside of the fan right the fans are
made for use on radiators and use
hydraulic bearings for long lifespan
rated at 40,000 hours for the fan the
fans have an RPM range of 500 to 1500
giving the ability to quiet down the
fans under low load or boost them for
heavy workloads the ring duo twelves are
available now learn more at the link in
the description below so this section
right here is your V core this right
here is your SOC and this is 1 2 3 14
phases and there's not a single doubler
anywhere on this motherboard oh and then
we have + 2 4 for our ISOs 2 phase SOC
power that's not a big deal though
that's pretty much standard for high and
motherboard since like X actually on X
370 there was a bunch of other words
which had 4 phase SOC power anyway here
we have a 14 + 2 and there's not a
single doubler in this and it's not the
Asus put your power stages in parallel
and act like it's two separate phases
when they're actually running in phase
with each other so now this this is a
proper 14 phase every single one of
these phases is indepent independently
current balanced and can be switched on
and off at the discretion of the voltage
controller depending on how much current
is being how much current output the vrm
has to provide and the way this is
achieved is this chip right over here
that is a Infineon XD PE and that's not
a p1 3 2 g 5 c this is in Finian's brand
new they like to market it as their 1000
amp voltage controller so luke
because this is really meant for like
high-end exotic data center CPUs and
that kind of thing so you know IBM stuff
that pulls a ton of power has a bunch of
cores tons of threads and just you'll
never see in a consumer platform so
that's really what this chip is meant
for it for you know huge pieces of
silicon that just pull a ton of power
I guess thread were I guess technically
epic would kind of fall into that
category if epic was overclockable but
which it isn't
but maybe AMD will decide to put out
like a 4 gigahertz base clock version of
epic that just pulls a stupid amount of
current in which case yeah that's that's
the kind of thing this chip is meant for
because this is a true 16 phase voltage
controller and that means you know
gigabyte can have all of these phases
with all of the benefits of having all
of these phases but none of the
downsides of having doublers because
doublers basically add a little bit of
delight to your pwm signals and there
are ways to work around that but you
know why work around having doublers
when you could just not have doublers
and still have all of the benefits of
having 14 phases though I would argue
for a rise in 3000 series CPU there's
basically no benefits to having actual 4
14 phase but gigabyte like this is the
x5 7000 recei extreme if if for summer
if suddenly risin started pulling a
thousand watts this VR I'm going to
suddenly become very very fitting so and
and currently I would dare say that this
is probably the most advanced voltage
regulator you'll see on a consumer
motherboard I'm not sure what's
happening in the service space I don't
really pay that much attention to it and
the same thing is true of the power
stages here so you know we have the
latest and greatest voltage controller
combined with the latest and greatest
power stage these are TDA two one four
seven twos from international rectifier
slash Infineon Infineon owns
international rectifier for a while now
so you can basically consider them the
same thing at this point
these are 70 M smart power stages and
the reason why smart power stages are
called smart power stages is because
unlike normal
our stages they integrate current
monitoring temperature monitoring over
current protection over temperature
protection the current monitoring that
they integrate is actually also more
accurate than what you would have on say
like a power IR stage which those
integrated current Marwat and Entering
but basically there's a new stat like
the the smart power stages are actually
like a new power stage standard from
Intel for their high end server
platforms that's that's what these chips
are also designed for so yeah basically
you know this vrm is absolutely insane
so with 14 phases of 70m so our power
stages you end up with a VR I'm that
quite frankly doesn't hit peak if it
like the thing is since this is a true
14 phase controller depending on how
gigabyte has a programmed if you're not
running like a maxed out 12 or 16
Corizon CPU most of this vrm will
probably not turn like shouldn't be
turning on because it'll just waste
power because if you look at the
efficiency curve for any any power stage
it looks like this so like if if you're
there's a sweet spot in terms of current
output where you get peak efficiency and
then anywhere below that you should just
not be running that many phases and the
curve I drew is a curve a bit wrong it's
normally a bit more like that but anyway
you get the idea
so this vrm is absolutely ridiculous
overkill if you're gonna run something
like a 12-8 core and I argue even the 12
core this is gonna be ridiculous
overkill but anyway 400 kilohertz
switching frequency per phase which is
actually relatively on the low side but
gigabyte does actually normally default
to that these power stages technically
support up to like 1.5 megahertz
a switching frequency so you know if you
wanted to throw all the extra efficiency
you got out for better output ripple and
less input ripple you could just crank
up the switching frequency to ridiculous
levels and then the 14 phases might
actually be useful because your per
phase power loss would well would go up
quite drastically especially if you were
pushing a significant amount of current
per phase anyway 400 kilohertz because
that's just convenient because that's
where the data sheet is spectat 1.2
volts out because again that's where the
data sheet is SPECT
and they unfortunately do not give a
nice power-efficient like power heat
dissipation to voltage curve like some
of the past parallel some other power
stages do so but we're just gonna go
with 1.2 volts ultimately is not gonna
make a huge difference in terms of the
overall heat output if you go from one
point two volts like one point four it's
not gonna make that much difference
hundred amps output is around what you'd
be looking at for like a risin first-gen
eight core I would assume that the third
gen eight cores will also run around a
hundred amps as well and horizon six
core would be below that well 100 amps
output this vrm will produce about nine
watts of heat the vrm does not need a
heatsink at all in fact the the x5 70
horas extreme is one of the few
motherboards on x5 70 with a completely
passive passive chipset cooling system
and you'll notice that the way the
cooling is designed on this motherboards
you have the chipset heatsink and then
there's a heat pipe that goes from the
chipset heat sink into the vrm heatsink
I honestly I think that that that
chipset heatsink is completely passive
mostly because the vrm doesn't produce
enough heat for this for there to be a
need like basically what's happening is
the chipset is probably heating up the
vrm more so than the VR I'm heating up
the actual vrm heatsink so yeah that's
the the the cooling system on this
motherboard is mostly there for the
chipset 150 amps you can't even hit that
unlike a 2700 X well you can but if your
2700 X is doing 150 amps it's not gonna
last very long
because you're gonna be pushing away too
much voltage so you could degrade and
completely destroy a 2700 X with this
motherboard while still not having a vrm
heatsink on it because it'll still
produce only about 13 watts of heat it's
extreme it's very extreme
going up to 200 amps output which is
probably where like even the 16 core
maxes out for Verizon third gen by the
sounds of the the power consumption that
these chips are hitting that sounds to
be the upper limit of what any rise in
3000 series series CPU will ever pull
and at that point
or at least on like ambient cooling and
at that point this motherboard should be
producing about 16 watts of heat the
motherboard still wouldn't care so yeah
like you know when you build a vrm that
quite frankly puts most X 299
motherboards to shame can you really be
surprised that it can handle 200 amps
output with only 16 watts of heat
dissipation like yeah the board very
much deserves the name it's given now if
we go on like I don't know how rising
3000 will scale on liquid nitrogen but I
I don't think it'll scale high enough
for this motherboard to care that much
anyway because even at 300 amps output
this board will be only producing about
24 watts of heat going up to 400 amps
output it'll produce only about 35 watts
of heat and going up to 500 amps output
it will finally produce something where
it's like you know a significant amount
of heat at 47 watts of heat now
admittedly from basically 24 Watts up
you're gonna want of erm heatsink from
in excess of 35 watts you'd are you'd
need like a substantial vrm heatsink or
maybe if it's not so substantial you'd
need some airflow this is all very much
like extreme overclocking territory on
liquid nitrogen and at that point you're
not gonna be running very long you know
like very long duration stress test so
you you still probably wouldn't need to
worry about the vrm cooling even then
this boards vrm is just awesome it's
just very very deserving of the extreme
label and quite possibly this is the
actually as so far I'm pretty sure this
is the best vrm on x5 17 there's just as
far as I'm aware there's not a single
motherboard that gets even close to this
because most of the other board vendor
actually as far as I know all of the
other board vendors are still using the
ir35 2:01 I've not yet seen a
motherboard other than gigabytes that
uses the XD PE 1 3 2 g 5c
so yeah gigabyte has just kind of
absolutely you know knocked it out of
the park here and the funny thing is
gigabyte in the past used to do things
like this I'll
if you go far back enough in motherboard
history gigabyte used to do motherboards
with absolutely ridiculous power
delivery solutions just kind of on the
regular if they they're their
top-of-the-line motherboard just
basically always had the most overkill
VR I'm you could find for the platform
with a few exceptions for example on h
EDT where there's not enough space
gigabytes plan to just cram phases kind
of wouldn't work out a lot of the time
on mainstream platforms yeah this is
this isn't really like this is sort of
gigabytes standard for erm design
philosophy it's just like we need to be
able to kill the cpu more than two times
over and then then the vrm is good
enough yeah that's basically why I'm
such a huge fan of this motherboard is
just like this vrm is insane now for the
SOC vrm I mean after like the thing is
the V Corps of erm here is already
ridiculously expensive so who cares that
you're gonna put more expensive power
stages into the SOC VR I'm more 70 amps
more power stages there as well these
chips go for about 3.5 dollars a chip in
bulk that is not cheap for comparison
you can get like 50 amp normal power
stages for $1 ish in bulk so yeah
they're about three and a half times
more expensive than slightly less
powerful power stages but admittedly
they're also not smart and within the
smart power stages category you can
actually find power stages under the $2
mark but the thing about those is those
are popular within videos founders
edition cards and well you won't see
them really used on motherboards because
the concern is that muther like nvidia
ships so many GPUs that there's a very
legitimate concern that if you buy if
you're buying a power stage that is
regularly used on reference and video
cards there might be supply shortages so
you don't want to be buying that because
you won't be able to keep using it for
for very like if Nvidia suddenly has to
make a bunch of cards you're just gonna
be like well we can't make any more
motherboards because there's no power
stages less for us anyway moving on from
the vrm which you know I think is
definitely the highlight of this board
let's go over some other things so we
have dual pin power connectors you don't
need this
definitely like even for the 12 Corizon
3000 series you definitely don't need to
8bim power connectors for the 16 core
you might have to plug in like half the
well now you for the 16 core you would
still be able to get away with the
single 8 pin if you have a power supply
that has all of its cabling done it well
the eight pins done in 16 gauge wires
because if you have the high current
variant of this power connector it's
actually 13 amps per pin pair and
basically that's 13 times 4 amps because
this is this isn't like a PCIe connector
where you have three active pairs and
then $0.02 wires this is just out like
that this is just ground in 12 volts in
there also it's worth noting that these
power connectors are completely parallel
the 12 volt plane is also shared between
the two power connectors so you could if
you wanted to do silly things like plug
in a 4 pin here plug in a 4 pin there
and technically you'd have like an 8 pin
but that's just dumb and you shouldn't
do that you don't need to plug in both
of these unlike maybe on extreme if
you're maybe pushing the CPU on liquid
nitrogen it might make sense to plug in
the extra well a whole extra 8 pin is
not necessary
Rison 3000 is not gonna pull a thousand
watts just like it's not gonna do that
ever yeah but you know high-end
motherboards tend to like having
unnecessary power connectors so yeah
there's no harm in it and you can
definitely plug in it and plug in the
extra power connector if you feel like
it it just won't really make any
difference to your overclocking because
well what 8 pin is more than enough for
for powering up to sort of 400 or even
500 watts of CPU and 500 Watts your
you're starting to get into the you know
you start running into the hole oh the
cables are starting to get warm the
power connectors starting to get warm
you might want to plug in an extra cable
but up until that point is just like who
cares
run run a single 8 pin you really don't
need to anyway so that's that we've got
a power we've got a power and reset
button on the rear i/o which in the past
I complained about that gigabyte decided
to put it here because if I'm if I have
my
the board on a test bench this is very
far away from me and awkward to reach so
gigabyte thought of me and they added an
extra power and an reset button over
here so we got that covered
kind of feels like like looking at this
board and the master it kind of feels
like gigabyte just made a checklist of
things I've complained about on their
motherboards in the past and it's just
like well that's taken care of that's
taken care of that's taken care of
anyway so we do have you know power and
reset where they should be as far as I'm
concerned we've got voltage read points
up here they are just solder bumps but I
understand that gigabyte really isn't
gearing like it is called the extreme
and it I might assume this motherboard B
would be quite competent at an extreme
overclocking but gigabyte definitely
doesn't like there was a time when
gigabyte literally had like an extreme
overclocking division of their product
development that the that was a thing
that's where you got all the super
overclock and like the OC Edition
motherboards yeah that that's since been
scrapped and this is kind of leftovers
from that the motherboards are really
targeted more at gaming and so you know
I understand why they're not bothering
with like having proper voltage
connectors and and ratio up-down buttons
BC LK up-down buttons I really want to
motherboard with like voltage control as
buttons on the side but nobody's yet
done that so we have a single phase
memory vrm which so the thing about the
single phase memory of erm is quite
frankly having a two phase memory of erm
doesn't matter but the this is gigabytes
most bog-standard single phase memory of
erm like they've been using this since
like at least z170 and it's fine it
overclocks fine ultimately with with
ddr4 it's less about what you power with
what you power it with and more about
what you do between the DIMM slots and
the cpu socket so all of the lovely
traces that we see running right here
much more important than what you
actually power your memory with but
still this is a bunch of 4 c10 and
MOSFETs from on semiconductor for all of
them so you have your high side to low
sides it's a single phase controlled by
a rich tech 8120 so
t-80 180 120 and this is just like
gigabytes been running this VR I'm
literally everywhere all the time and
it's fine the main thing is that
honestly the like the the single phase
memory power it's just it's not a big
deal but I kind of feel like you know
since they did this on them the V Corps
VR I mean they could have done something
a little bit more elaborate but
ultimately it doesn't matter that much
for the trace layout between the DIMM
slots and the CPU socket we are looking
at daisy chain historically gigabyte is
what like insists on using t topology
unlike everything i basically pointed
out to gigabyte like hey your t2 policy
boards if somebody's running 2x8 it
doesn't overclock very well and they're
like yeah but if people want to run 4x8
then then T technology works better for
a risin 3,000 the memory controller has
changed and everybody seems to be going
to daisy chain now gigabytes included
I'm interested to see how this works out
because this could be really really good
also if you're wondering about why these
are missing engineering sample
motherboard see that that's a revision
0.1 retail board's from gigabyte are 1.0
or well one point something so those are
actually populated on the the retail
bond the board and so yeah with the
memory overclocking ultimately you'll
have to test it because you can't like I
can't I ball trace quality actually I'd
be really surprised if anyone could
eyeball trace quality like just look at
the trace layer I'd go like yes this is
a this is a good memory overclocking
solution I'd be very surprised if there
was anybody capable of doing that here's
the thing you can have the best memory
power to memory power delivery ever if
your trace layout is screwed up doesn't
matter if your memory training
procedures in the BIOS are screwed up
doesn't matter like the powering ddr4 is
really really easy the big problem is
maintaining signal integrity to and from
the dims
and that come that's mostly about you
know the trace layout and then there's
also the bios which has to know how to
time the the signaling with the
motherboard so anyway moving on from
there we have a right angled 24 pin that
gigabytes actually pushed in a little
bit on the board which I'm a fan of
because basically the main concern with
angled 24-pin power connectors is that
this can cause some issues with case
compatibility it would have slightly
less issues with cases than if they just
had it on the same you know just how
they pushed out a bit more we have of
course a postcode right here so if you
are pushing memory clocks this gets
really really yeah well actually if
you're doing any kind of advanced
overclocking this can be extremely handy
because over time you'll just figure out
what errors mean you know if this
voltage is too low or if some timings
are screwed up or if you can actually
over time that this can be super helpful
also some board vendors actually publish
like cheat sheets for their postcode
readout so it's like oh if you get this
post code it means this voltage is not
high enough or you've really screwed up
your memory timings there there's a few
that if you get that post code it just
means you're wrong you need to go and
change everything anyway moving along
the the edge of the board down here we
have a BIOS which and a BIOS mode switch
so gigabyte what boards you know
standard feature for them is dual BIOS
main BIOS is actually socketed this
might change the well I've had
engineering sample boards come in that
had a socketed while like pictures of
engineering sample boards with socketed
while PSA's and then the retail ones
don't have it but the high-end retail
boards should should still have a
socketed main BIOS chip and there's also
a backup while strip and the thing is
gigabytes dual BIOS is normally
implemented as an automatic system where
if you fail to post too many times in a
row it'll just go from one BIOS to the
other and when that happens you know
you'll it'll look like it wiped all of
your BIOS profiles because your BIOS
profiles are saved with the BIOS chip so
like though if you save it like if
you're overclocking on the main BIOS
save a bunch of profiles then fail to
post like three times in a row and you
end up on the backup files all of your
profiles are still on the main BIOS chip
so that gets really really annoying
really really quick if you're doing a
lot of overclocking and failing to post
over and over and over again which is
kind of normal if you're doing lots of
if you're really pushing memory so
gigabyte acknowledges that this is a
problem and so on their high end boards
you have a bio like you have a switch
here that basically allows you to
disable the automatic BIOS switching
system that these boards come with and
then you have this switch over here
which you can use to manually choose
which
I'll ship your own so you can go between
the main BIOS or backup BIOS by your own
decision instead of relying on the
motherboard to to do it for you down
here we have a six pin power connector
for extra power to the PCIe slots this
is wrong this is just straight up wrong
okay this is like my one major complaint
for this whole motherboard is this is
done wrong like how am I gonna put a
fourth GPU in here I mean third GPU in
this PCIe slaw if this is plugged in
seriously how because that power
connector sticks straight up you plug
that in and there is no way you're
getting another Jeep like there's no way
you're getting a PCI card into this PCIe
slot and my and you might be like oh but
it's useful if you're running to a sli
if you're running 2-way SLI or two-way
crossfire your GPUs will not be pulling
enough power to need the extra PCIe
power connector because basically well
okay maybe if you really hammered some
rx for 80s or something you might need
this but most GPUs are designed with
sensible power demands on their PCIe
slot so they won't exceed the 75 watt
per slot limit and the issue with the 70
like the issue with multi-gpu setups is
not that they exceed the 75 watt limit
per PCIe slot is that the 24 pin only
has two 12 volt power connectors in it
and those are in charge of powering all
of your PCIe slots these are dedicated
to CPU power so normally what happens if
you run like a four-way or a 3-way setup
or well not normally but what you can
sometimes run into with three-way and
four-way GPU setups is that you melt
your 24 pin this exists to solve that
except you can't run 3-way or 4-way on
this motherboard because this blocks the
third PCIe slot if you actually try to
use it so yeah now on the flip side
there's very like I don't think
anybody's gonna actually like I'm
interested in running three-way and
four-way most people aren't so I
completely understand that you know it's
just like this is not this is non-issue
for the average like for real-world
users for but it's just wrong like from
a design perspective this is just wrong
it should not be at this angle it should
be flat and like I get that they don't
have enough space
here because basically what they're
running into with this connector is that
if you lay that connector flat it takes
up a lot more space that way and it
would basically look something like that
and then you'd plug in like so and well
that obviously wouldn't work because
your PC slot needs to move but they
could have put it like here maybe or
rearrange the audio section and put it
over here which you know I get that that
it's just like that this is this right
the way this is implemented it just kind
of feels like they they smacked it on
there so that they have something to put
on the feature list rather than actually
making it a useful feature which is
pretty standard practice for a lot of
things in the motherboard industry but
yeah like ultimately for normal users
this doesn't matter for me this is just
from from my perspective this is like
why even put it on there if it's going
to be implemented wrong anyway moving on
other good things about the motherboard
you get ten gig LAN and so that's the
quantity of 10 gig LAN and you also get
one gig Intel LAN and you also get an
Intel Wi-Fi card with Wi-Fi six on it so
yeah and that covers all of the features
on this motherboard this is yeah did I
mention that the I did mention that the
chips chipset his passive didn't I yeah
I've been trying to really like I made a
mistake in like one of my earlier takes
and to retake it a bunch redo this video
a bunch of times anyway so yeah that's
the X 570 or s extreme probably the best
vrm on the entire x5 70 platform I don't
really think there's any motherboard
that gets close to this on the power
delivery now does that actually mean
this motherboard will overclock your cpu
better not necessarily because there's a
basically after you reach a certain
level of voltage regulator quality going
past that doesn't take tend to make much
of a difference if any difference like
you know and I think this vrm is very
well in that area of it just doesn't
matter anymore guys there's like the X
the X 570 mass
you know probably it performs exactly
the same in CPU overclocking as this
does except the vrm on that will run a
little bit warp a little bit warmer but
that's still like the x5 70 master is
still a true 12 phase and this board is
just kind of like like at this point
it's just showing off okay it's like
look what we can do and we when we make
a motherboard where the the price tag is
basically build the board first set the
price of a price tag later and I
appreciate that like this is an insane
motherboard it is not a motherboard you
need but it could be a motherboard you
want because the this this is absolutely
ridiculous but the the question still of
course remains is like well how will the
memory overclocked and go because you
know like if if the memory overclocking
sucks then you know the vrm in my
opinion is kind of negated but yeah that
like memory overclocking is really
something you have to actually test in
the real world you can't look at the
memory slots or the memory layout
topology and and go like oh this is good
this is bad just doesn't work also
especially because there's like weird
quirks with what the the BIOS is what
the memory well like there's so much to
memory overclocking that it's I you
could write books about it I couldn't
I'm not that good at it but some people
who are good write books about it and
they would go forever anyway so yeah
that is the x5 70 horas extreme and it
is very extreme and thanks for watching

comment section below if you'd like to
support gamers Nexus we've got a patreon
for people who want to support us
directly and there's also store gamers
nexus net if you'd like to you know
support us by buying merch and i have
another channel called actually hardcore
overclocking where I do overclocking
things with that are like longer and
more more in-depth than just completely
useless for day-to-day users so you know
overcome that kind of stuff so thanks
