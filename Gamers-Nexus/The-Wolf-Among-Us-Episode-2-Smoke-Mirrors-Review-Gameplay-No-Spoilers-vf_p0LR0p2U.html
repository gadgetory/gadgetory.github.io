beef from gamers in excess net talking
about the wolf among us episode to smoke
and mirrors the wolf among us is an
adventure type series from Telltale
Games the developers at the walking dead
and it's based on the fables comics
fables comics take all these characters
from fairy tales and nursery rhymes and
put them in the Fabletown slums in new
york city leaving them to violence drugs
and just about anything that would make
walt disney roll over in his grave you
play as bigby wolf the fable town
sheriff and go around interrogating
characters and breaking down crime
scenes most of the time you're using a
dialogue wheel and can play as a good
cop bad cop or anywhere in between so in
smoke and mirrors Big B is investigating
a murder that happened at the end of
episode 1 which I won't spoil so you're
picking up where episode 1 left off
interrogating the suspect you arrested
at the end of that episode and getting
some important info on a new lead in the
case from there you're nearly getting
into a scuffle at a strip club and
conducting a forensic autopsy among
other scenes Telltale Games has done an
excellent job of creating and
maintaining suspense and further
developing the character relationships
from episode 1 the dialogue between Big
B and the other characters seems fluid
not forced you've got enough options and
even though a lot of the dialogue is
timed you still have enough time to read
through the decisions and make a
conscious choice episode 1 sometimes
didn't give me enough time so this was a
good improvement to see a lot of the
characters from episode 1 return but
there are some good additions to smoke
and mirrors the stand out here is
Georgie the strip club owner and his
initial stubbornness made for a fun
scene my Paragon Big B finally got fed
up and decided to kick down a cigarette
vending machine so this was one of the
ways i felt big b's integrity was tested
in the episode we had the chance to
experience the different sides of big be
like when he slowly picks around a
corpse for evidence while his partner in
crime shudders and fights the urge to
hold him back there's even a scene where
he has to find out how toad jr. came
across the same body so he bends down
and you know depending on how you play
through it you can really see a
sensitive side from him telltale games
does a
nice job with animating the facial
expressions of these characters
especially in the most dire instances
but as well as the character
relationships and dialogue dynamics play
out I've got mixed feelings about Big
D's fight scenes these are quick time
event scenes that look stylish and break
up the gameplay but our kind of half
empty in the grand scheme of things I
had only one scuffle and smoke and
mirrors so it seemed kind of thrown in
there especially since it had nothing to
do with one of the murder suspects or at
least that's what I think right now I
used my xbox controller and notice that
once or twice I'd hit the wrong button
but Big B would still execute a punch or
dodge an attack I saw the same thing in
episode 1 so it kind of sucks to have
something unpolished like that still
around the other thing is that the
storyline focuses almost entirely on the
snow white storyline and not the faith
murder we invested ourselves in in
episode 1 and even though I understand
everyone's playthrough of the game will
be different I didn't see much of my
decisions from episode one carrying over
to episode two for example why didn't i
get to hunt down Tweedledum and why
wasn't there a payoff for coming to mr.
Toad's aid in episode one this time I
mean God my decision from that got
another guy killed just kind of you know
a loose end that I didn't get to see
tied up but despite that I still see the
wolf among us as a strong franchise for
people who want a break from running and
gunning or wandering around in an MMORPG
episode 2 doesn't explore multiple
storylines or threaten us with new
bloodthirsty characters as much as
episode 1 did but it does an excellent
job developing Big B and setting us up
for more plot twists with its
cliffhanger ending by the game for its
storytelling and for its visuals just
don't expect any brilliant gameplay
innovations alright so to learn more
about the wolf among us head over to our
website gamers Nexus net we've got
written reviews of episodes one and two
and get yourself some brownie points by
