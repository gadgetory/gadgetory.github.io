star citizen that closely the authoring
tools shown at citizen Khan 2016 are
pretty cool at least from a technology
standpoint this is all plugged into
CryEngine or what's now called star
engine and it's done with what Sean
Tracey was describing as planet ed or
planet editor so we can see some of the
procedural generation tool set in action
from the citizen Khan demo which is what
you're watching here if you missed the
stream this is a good place to at least
keep up with what's going on behind the
scenes and learn a bit about game
development from a lower level in terms
of the engine technology and things like
that so in this demo what is shown
primarily is planet head we can see
using basically paintbrushes almost in
Photoshop style to paint biomes and
things like that on the surface there's
large object placement as well we see
that towards sort of the middle end of
the demo and then it's also used to
showcase the flexibility of the engine
built now called star engine on top of
CryEngine we're sort of a more accurate
and swamp like planet is used as the
demonstration for more exotic biomes and
territories and things like that as
opposed to the traditional desert planet
and ice planet and the earth like
homestead demo so I will let you watch
through this if you haven't followed
star citizen at all I think it's pretty
interesting just again from a
development standpoint but we won't be
commenting through the whole thing
because it's pretty long so it's just
here as a reference material if it's
needed in the future we're hosting it on
our own just for that reason so without
further ado I'll let you get to the
content hit links in the description
below for follow-up coverage of citizen
Khan 2016 I'll see you all next time
alright so the next thing is that
there's no research interview distance
you saw this in the whole pull through
in the initial demo well you'll see this
here is Simon zooms around
the editor again this is all happening
real time we thought it best to show how
we actually built this up for you guys
so that you guys can have a little bit
if they think we're going to be able to
fill all this content up for you so one
of the things we like to do is just kind
of show the scale because the scale is
really hard to wrap your mind around as
even as I even as a designer it can be
very charming when you go from just a
centimeter level of precision all the
way out to thousands and thousands of
kilometers so he brought the character
in there just give you an idea of what
you're actually looking at because it
would be easy to get sort of a god
complex when you're looking at this kind
of stuff all right so I think we're
going to go find a little area here and
do a little bit of work because one of
the biggest and most powerful pieces of
the tools and it's probably what we work
on the hardest is that it's artist
guided but it's procedurally generated
so the artist can still have this really
fine-tuned control over the areas that
they want but we can do it on such a
massive scale and they can even go in
afterwards and sort of tweak up the
object so you'll see he's actually just
creating more landscape and we actually
use an ecosystem system ecosystem
technology to do this so I'm going to
let time and paint a little bit of
terrain here and this is pretty awesome
this is what we get to do every day so
it's really exciting to be able to work
on this kind of technology and it's even
better to be able to stand in front of
you guys in front of this kind of
technology because there's 360 other you
know developers that are working on this
stuff so going to say
massive massive team effort all right so
what he's actually doing taking down
different ecosystems the ecosystem is
kind of like a high-level visual
representation of a classic level of a
classic game level really so the
ecosystem who finds things like to the
general terrain shape so whether it's
down the desert whether it's Mountain
whether it's ocean it also defines some
of the main feature terrains but things
like erosion or valleys and trees and
you can see as he paints around it
changes all the ecosystem underneath all
right so we find a nice little spot to
build up on
so while Simon looks for a little spot
here just let you know the planets are
made out of all these ecosystem tiles or
chunks and it's made out of thousands of
these chunks and we can modify them
again on a really really macro scale so
on a planetary scale or on a very very
micro excited state so the first thing
he likes to drop down is always a little
bit of a lake or river so of course
we've got the water support that we
wanted to but we had to actually rewrite
the whole ocean and water volume system
in the CryEngine to be able to support
again the spherical level terrain and as
you can see the results are actually
really really good
it's no pressure on Simon at all so what
he's placing it now is one of these
object containers so again we thought
it'd be cool if we really just kind of
pulled the pulled the curtains and
showed you how we how we make this stuff
so an object container is how we
actually classify a whole bunch of
different objects so it might be lights
in might be geometry might even be
script there's many different things
that an object container can contain and
the whole point of object containers is
really so that we have this powerful
streaming system so that we can bring in
an entire level worth of content and
then bring it out and even better we can
fly around levels of content which is
what the capital ships are really doing
so this is the tower we just saw in
homestead we're going to set up a little
location here we'll put a couple objects
down and we'll do a little bit of its
horn
so you see how quickly the designer
actually controls the procedural
distribution of the trees grass groups
of objects and this isn't restricted to
vegetation right you can do this frogs
continue this with grass you can do this
with buildings me ? we'll get to that at
some point I'm sure so one of the things
I did promise my German counterparts is
that we keep the tools off the screen
because they really want to reveal this
stuff they've done a ton of work on
these teams so a lot of what you see we
get to showcase you know the final
results of this stuff but there is so
much work that actually goes into being
able to bring you that and a lot of
those guys don't get enough credit so
for the excited to be able to stand in
front of this stuff for them
so he's dressing up the scene a little
babies trying to make a little bit nicer
looking we've got a special little prop
here that Simon seems to like your drop
in you might recognize it so we're
creating a little homeless crab think he
lives under the tower yeah he's got
family
take a bigger one our time so that gives
you a really good idea you know this
took one maybe you know 56 minutes and
we're able to build up just a little
section now you know this isn't about to
chip out to you guys looking exactly
like this but again it shows I thought
he was mad we would ship inside me too
so again we need to be able to create
this content super quickly but still
have that artists input because if you
don't have that artists name village
eventually you end up with very generic
looks and we can't give you these
moments that we really are are excited
to share with you so what do you think
fun bit is up in a lot of game levels
the thing is is that you're in a skybox
like it what you're not what is so hard
to wrap your head around is that that's
not a skybox that's actual atmosphere
scattering that's happening the sky is
blue because the light scatters right so
let's just kind of prove that to you
those little sprites in the sky they're
not really sprites those are other
planets
one of the other cool things anyways
just about our editor in general you saw
that while he's developing he can
actually just jump in and start actually
playing the game directly from it it's a
super powerful tool you won't iterate
too much on stuff if you have to shut
down take five minutes to reload some
other some other executable then you
come back to your editor being able to
just my newly change thing after thing
after thing and jump in and try it again
a jump in and try it again to jump in
and try to gives you really polished
content so there's one reason I'm
standing here talking about it I was
flying his actually is a very very good
pilot I think we're about to showcase
there's no pressure so that's not a
sprite let's go
this is kind of showing off a little
more of the exotic ecosystem that we can
do and we barely just scratch the
surface on how far we could really take
the the exotic bit things are sulfur
legs this place probably just stinks I
mean it's super hot the sunset though
that you can see again with the
atmosphere scattering we get this for
free and not for free i mean somebody
worked very very hard but in terms of
actually running in the game when the
Sun comes down on the horizon yeah we're
going to give that span right now she
lives in outsiders because welcome so
you see they're doing a bit of money
here like Simon's he's brave
down we're all done there's no pressure
but we really wanted to show you again
like without having to big epidemic put
around it we wanted to show you how we
kind of you know level design jazz Simon
called it earlier just something a
little bit improv accomplices
information with us so we're gonna go
chase it down see where he went hey
Bronk
it's an imposition</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
