joined by Donna Bullock rosti from AMD
and we're going to talk about CPUs so
before you get into that all this
coverage brought to you by cyberpowerpc
is at fain book and other hardware which
we've recently overclocked more
information links below as always Don
let's start with the newest announcement
here today the Wraiths coolers so what's
happening on the Wraith run well we had
a lot of positive feedback about the
Rays cooler obviously really a discrete
class cooler and so because of that
feedback we're including with two more
processors today that's the FX 6350 and
the fx-8350 and that the 6350 would be a
new of like the most accessible now at
the same price as it currently is with
the race cooler it's not the same for
the 8350 is the price different yep
they're both going to track about the
same as they are today so in new lake
today is 63 50s about one hundred twenty
dollars the 8350 is about 140 150 so
expect it to come in to market about
those prices very cool and then the ATK
we just recently benchmarked so that's
the once you give a quik Shmi let
everyone know sure the ad IDK comes with
the essentially it's a wraith cooler
without the shroud and the LED so it's
really extremely capable hardware that's
a that's a cooler easily capable of
cooling a processor of a 125 watts and
that ATK's only a 95 lat processor so
you got a lot of nice head room there
for guys who want to push it further and
in that class hardware right some
overclocking one of the interesting
topics for cpus these days of course DX
while vulcan are changing things a lot
for the industry what on the multi-core
side how does dx12 benefit CPU
specifically and what should we look
forward to with regard to that well i
think by now everybody knows about
multi-threaded command buffering and DX
12 and and how it's finally truly we got
some really multi-threaded game engines
on the horizon and and we're starting to
see I mean we saw that 3d mark ferndale
sorta sort of showed some what we
thought were pie in the sky ideal
benchmarks and
and then we so I asked you the
singularity we're starting to see like
wow that really does fun performance up
in some cases almost twice as high right
so really exciting there we've got a ton
of new titles coming over the next month
I'm not the ISP engagement god that's
that's Peter ah so I forget which one's
a blow to talk about i'm not going to
say i'm not going to say the game named
i know one you can talk about I know
that total war war hammer right is dx12
enabled right and that's one of many
coming out and we've got a lot of really
really positive cpu performance uplifts
out of there so the cool part is all the
people with these I mean AMD's been on
top of more cores for a long time so in
theory the guys who but like you know
six and eight core AMD processors a
while ago are going to see this awesome
free boost in performance and it really
keeps it makes it relevant in you know
2016 and beyond having these lots of CPU
cores which is great right like that's
kind of cool so a lot of that is just
from removing the draw calls moving the
draw calls to the GPU I guess right yeah
I mean I mean there's a lot of there's a
lot of stuff going on under the hood and
dx12 this is not it's just not
specifically draw calls but but it I
mean it just does a great job of moving
those resources to all the different
course oh so then on the front of dx12
in the immediate future with your say in
more cores should benefit things I know
CryEngine is capable of running eight
threads and then other engines but I
think we've seen as well we're with AMD
and other vendors are finally supporting
additional threads yeah in the immediate
future looks like
yeah it's a really bright future I mean
no one's going to say that Direct X 12
isn't going to totally dominate gaming
over the next couple of years it's
pretty obvious so it's it's kind of nice
to be in that position and have all
these multiple processors just ready to
go let's do a quick Zen question here is
there anything that you can tell us or
timelines or anything like that I'm not
allowed to say anything more bugs in
except that it's very exciting to be on
the team that's working on the stuff
that's going to really change the game
over the next over the next while and we
will have more news this year obviously
and it's very exciting really good stuff
coming so I think people will be really
really happy to see what we have on the
table very cool sir more than news later
this year we'll definitely be covering
it as it rolls out as always link the

we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
