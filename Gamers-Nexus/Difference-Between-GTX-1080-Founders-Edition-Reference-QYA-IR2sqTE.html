end videos at GTX 1080 and GTX 1070
Lodge and that confusion is centered on
the term founders edition which sounds
like something out of a Kickstarter
campaign maybe you have the legendary
edition or whatever and it's a limited
time offer that is not the case with the
gtx 1088 founders edition it is not
limited time it is not only for founders
or early buyers as we understand it's in
the gaming world but what it is is a
replacement of the nomenclature
reference card using these air quotes
just to kind of be clear about things
because there's these terms are
important to understand because it has
caused this confusion so the reference
cards they have a reference cooler that
reference PCB and they of course just
have a standard clock they're basically
a stock card as stock as you can get it
anyway that has existed for several
generations now the new generation GT X
1080 1070 the term reference card is
gone nvidia has axed it they have
replaced it with founders Edition that
means the terms are effectively
synonymous if you hear us or anyone else
use the phrase a reference card when
referring to the new GT X 1080 or 1070
what they are referring to is what
Nvidia is branding as the founders
Edition same thing so here's where the
confusion came from Nvidia did its
review of the GTX 1000 series on Friday
we were there we covered it and they
sort of on stage presented this as we're
going to have cards from $600 MSRP to a
special $700 version the founders
Edition and they talked about
overclocking maybe not the same sentence
but in a basically the same paragraph
with regard to the founders Edition so
it sounded like to us anyway and I know
to a lot of folks who commented on our
videos asking for clarity it sounded
like the founders Edition was specially
Bend or maybe had some kind of special
thing in there basically became a
question of what what special founders
Edition versus reference and the the
thing is there's no more reference so
it's replaced it it's not specially Bend
it has the new ID or new industrial
design which is that sort of tessellated
shroud but it's got the same more or
less cooler used to it has the vay
for chamber cooling with a large alloy
block with fins in it and a vrm blower
fan and in the shroud pretty much the
reference color we know I should say
founders edition cooler that we know
pretty much the same thing there so
there's no special bidding no pre
overclock even and it cost seven hundred
dollars so then the question becomes
okay I get it there is no more reference
card there is only this founders edition
gtx 1080
why then does it cost more than the $600
MSRP the answer to that just from our
analysis because there's the short of it
there was a long discussion with nvidia
about this so the short of it is this is
my analysis of the situation
I don't think NVIDIA wants to compete
with their partners because just like
why would you if you're a supplier of a
product which Nvidia is to go out and
then sell your own product while you
have partners trying to do the same on
your behalf is something you need to be
careful of as a supplier and videos in
an interesting market position as are
these other vendors in some cases within
the industry because they both make an
end-user product and they make the
device that goes into it that is sold to
what effectively becomes the that and
board partners so MSI and EVGA and PNY
and Asus and all the others will buy the
gpgpu whatever that Pascal chip is that
they want to buy from Nvidia they'll put
that into maybe their own board maybe
with to go back to the same people twin
frozer or a CX or whatever Strix
whatever cooling solutions they have
they might throw that on there and those
cards can be priced anywhere from $600
is higher so $600 is MSRP they can sell
as low as 600 founders Edition 700 maybe
something like a hybrid some liquid cool
device would be 750 800 I'm that's just
total example I'm not telling you
something that that is unannounced total
example so basically NVIDIA was trying
to come in at the middle of the stack
they're saying look we want people to be
able to our partners be able to sell
stuff down here we want them to be able
to sell stuff up here we want to be in
the middle with this reference this
founders edition reference card so a
founders edition equals reference card
that's the end of that
and video is making one device that
looks like 11 and video is making one
device and that is the founders Edition
they are not making - they are not
making a reference card and a founders
Edition card hopefully that clears
everything up I really don't think
there's more that I can say here without
just repeating myself a thousand more
different ways but there were a lot of
questions about this so I wanted to be
very clear if you do have more questions
about this there's an article I wrote
it's a couple hundred words pretty short
for us hit that in the link in the
description below that will recap
everything and provide maybe a little
bit more information but that's really
basically it so hopefully that answers
your questions if you have more please
post them because I will find the
answers for you and or at least try to
and of course we'll be covering these
cards as they near official launch which
is May 27th for the 1080 and June 10th
for the gtx 1070 i just got off a plane
so we just got back from austin going to
Computex soon and we will be at Computex
when the card officially launches but if
you're not our reviews and all of that
will be as normal online on on the day
you would expect them to be so thank you
for watching patron like the petrel
video if you wanna helps out directly
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
