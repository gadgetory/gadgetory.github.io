Nexus dotnet and I'm here with another
hardware guide today today we are going
to look at cable management practices
and tips this guide has meant more for
the intermediate builder and some of the
beginning builders keep in mind that we
do skip a couple of the steps because
we're assuming that you have an
intermediate level knowledge of PC
building but on that note we will talk
about cable management practices and
what you can do to properly manage your
cables which we'll talk about why that's
helpful in just a second here so check
the full guide on the site I want to say
first of all check the full guide on the
website for more detail on each of these
tips and for more custom support Nick
from a former an tech representative is
now writing for us and he wrote the
guide so huge props to him for doing
that your objective with cable
management is pretty simple you want to
create the cleanest internal computing
environment that ensures your system
will operate at peak efficiency loose or
jumbled cables in general will decrease
your airflow and they will increase the
amount of preventative maintenance you
have to do in terms of dust management
and system clean-out so you definitely
want to decrease that workload and make
sure your parts will not be damaged by
any dust and not be damaged by hampered
airflow so Caleb management and the in
the long run definitely saves you time
and it helps increase the lifespan of
your components it's also conducive to
showing off your system which of course
is always the most important factor in a
gaming build you want to show off those
parts and not look like a fool who just
spent a lot of money and didn't spend
the time to properly clean the case so
let's talk about how you can actually do
that the build order itself there are a
million different ways you can build a
system many of you already know how to
build a system but the order I
personally prefer to do when I'm
building with cable management in mind
is I like to start with the power supply
and then actually move to the drives a
lot of people will do the motherboard
pretty early but I do the power supply
just because it's huge and has the most
potential to damage something if it's
not mounted properly so I like to get
that in there early and I move to the
drives because some cases just
it's easier to put the drives in before
the motherboard because you're not
fighting with other internals if you
just put them in first and they're not
in the way if they're in their first so
then I move to the motherboard
after the drives with the CPU heatsink
and RAM all pre-installed outside of the
case because I normally test them before
installing them in the case then I
manage all the cables and then I move to
the video card and finalize cable
management the video card is last
because I know that some cases will not
allow the eight or four pin 12-volt
connector that plugs in near the CPU to
pass through the back of the case so you
normally have to pass it under the video
card if that is the case in your case
also keep electrostatic discharge
compliance in mind when you're building
if you have more questions on ESD
comment below or post on our forums for
in-depth support be very careful you
want an ESD wrist strap to ensure you're
not zapping any components and don't
stick anything in your case that is not
ESD compliant because it can permanently
damage components so keep that in mind
when using things like tape because some
tape will hold the charge depending on
what you're using once everything is
installed it's time to start managing
cables though so let's talk about the
basic principles of cable management
there are a few key principles of cable
management that you want to keep in mind
throughout the entire process first your
main goal is to elongate the cables to
maximize their travel distance to the
target this actually helps stretch out
the cables and it prevents the cable
bulge on the backside that will of the
motherboard tray that is which will
obviously prevent you from closing the
case or cause dents or other problems
next it's time into its well actually
it's just very important in general to
keep future expansions in mind determine
if there's anything you're planning to
upgrade in the near future if there is
leave that component somewhat unfinished
so that you can more easily modify it
when that time comes and while you're at
it make sure there are no major fan
ports being obstructed by the excess
cable tools for the job
there are few tools that I recommend for
managing cables most effectively a
modular power supply of course is very
nice to have and will make your case
more free of clutter as you'll be able
to remove excess cables that aren't
getting used
you also want twist ties and zip ties
and all the ties to hold cables down and
tie them to each other
before we start routing cables check if
your case will support routing an eight
pin or four pin 12 volt connector that's
the one that plugs in near your CPU
through the back of the case if your
cable isn't long enough you can get an
extender for it and if the motherboard
doesn't have enough room to support that
cable head to fit through in the top
then you'll have to resort to routing it
under the video card instead which is
fine don't sweat it just just keep that
in mind and pass it under your video
card before you plug the video card in
it's time to start actually moving
cables now though so let's start with
the fat 24-pin connector since it's the
most obvious untangle everything and
shove it through the bottom pass-through
or grounded hole then push it through
these push through all these SATA power
connectors and if relevant the 12 volt
connector before plugging these in
though we do want to deal with the cases
tiny connectors remember how I said that
I like to keep the small things under
the big things well we're going to find
those small things in the form of front
panel connectors the USB connector HD
audio LEDs power switches all that stuff
relevant cables that are routed from the
front send them through the back if
possible either push them between the
drive bays and the motherboard wall or
find a grounded hole for them some cases
will have them pre routed through the
back so take advantage of that if you
can once they're in place stretch them
out along the wall of the motherboard
tray and then pull them back into the
case through the pass-through that is
closest to their destinations repeat
this process until all front panel
connectors are in place and then plug
them in of course next grab your SATA
power connectors and route them to your
drives preferably your
hard drives and SSDs should be facing
the right side of the case in newer
models which makes it much easier to
conceal the connectors and easier to
swap out in general if you want to
change things later once the power is in
do the same for the data cables the
actual SATA 3 or SATA 2 cables
patch those all through and plug them in
to their respective ports try to keep
everything as as tight on the
motherboard as possible you don't want a
lot of cables showing on the inside plug
the 12-volt eight the 12 volts 8 pin or
4 pin connector into the motherboard if
there's a pass-through for it otherwise
hold it until the video just before the
video card is in and plug that in right
before you plug the video card in and
then of course make sure the cable fits
under the card plug the 24 pin connector
into the board and do this just by
passing it through the back first and
then pull it back through the hole
nearest its destination just try to hide
it as much as humanly possible you
basically only want the connector and an
inch or two of wire to be or wire
shielding to be showing on the inside of
the case just because it is fat and
pretty noticeable so with all of those
and finish connecting the 12 volt
connector if you haven't yet mount the
video card pass its PCIe connectors
through the bottom pass-through then
pull them through the one nearest the
GPU and connect them and finally connect
any stray cables or fan cables that
we've missed anything from other
expansion cards or from drives or from
front panels or whatever anything
hanging around that you don't like this
is the time to reroute it and begin
using your zip ties twist ties and other
means to hold cables down to ensure they
don't move around on you don't commit to
zip ties until you've confirmed that
you're happy with the cable routing
though because it is a huge pain in the
butt to cut those ties and retie them
over and over and of course you run out
of them eventually so do keep that in
mind and be careful not to scratch the
case when you're cutting that's pretty
much it though you should be all done at
