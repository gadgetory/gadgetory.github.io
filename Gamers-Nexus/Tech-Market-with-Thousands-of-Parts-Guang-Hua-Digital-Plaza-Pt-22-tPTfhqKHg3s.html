digital Plaza we already did one video
looking at video card prices and memory
prices and now we're back this time we
be looking at a couple of other cool
things so testing equipment other
Hardware on the street SMDs
we'll be revisiting a shop which out
last year with thermocouple circuit
readers capacitors resistors all that
stuff just kind of cool to see the sort
of density and concentration of PC
hardware enthusiasts DIY project
hardware in one spot in person not on
the internet for once so we're gonna
just explore the area and see what there
is to offer here and other than that I
think check out the video card pricing
video if you want to see what the GPU
prices are here in Taiwan with the
mining consideration in mind otherwise
let's go take a look at the rest of the
plaza before that this video is brought
to you by thermal takes view 37 case the
view 37 focuses on highlighting custom
PC builds with its full panoramic window
and tinted front acrylic and our thermal
testing the view 37 performed reasonably
well when considering its looks focused
build which is partly thanks to the
airflow design and the removal of a
bottom power supply shroud for a balance
of looks and performance check the link
in the description below for the view 37
so allow me to introduce to you all the
magic Pro complete with devil horns
power supply enjoy your life because
it's going to be a short one when you
use this dual 12 volt compliant yeah
it's a lot of specs the the magic which
we're not a thing anymore since a long
time that cabling is crazy I can't
believe that it's getting better like
it's hard to find that so what are they
is it just basically they laid the cable
in there and then as stuff fails they're
just adding more yeah
it's probably like I wondered I test the
oldest cables in there they're probably
50 years old right maybe maybe more
that's insane
it's almost an archeological site or it
is just the one you went to yeah yeah
jean-claude
so some of these we have some of these
exact devices but branded differently
and that's it's not because these are
knock-offs I'm almost positive it's
because most people just buy kind of a
complete unit and then put their brand
on it it's like this for example
that's an amp probe a thermocouple
reader so we actually have some of these
it's it's labeled amp probe at home here
it's labeled chy but it's the same
product what I can tell the buttons are
a bit different but all the functions
are the same yeah shift wears log
buttons aren't slightly different places
actually but it's the same thing overall
so this was just not a this one I don't
know if it saves data or not these over
here
so Omega cells these gray divide gray
and blue devices so these are typically
going to be things like anemometers that
connect with a hot wire or something you
plug in some cable to it I don't know if
these specific ones or anemometers or
not these these are actually k-type
thermocouple or thermocouple regions I
think I don't know they're k-type Union
targets as t1 t2 t1 t2 so these might be
thermocouple readers but in the US you
basically buy them from Omega they're
branded Omega sold as Omega but
ultimately just like everything in PC
hardware like with closed oblique
coolers made by someone else and then
they stick the brand on it maybe
customize some stuff stuff like that so
other than that I'm sorry recognized
here anemometer or like wind vane more
or less see there's DMM digital
multimeters down here what are the
prices on these these the amp probe is I
don't see a prize
who have you sir chin one yeah it's okay
yeah
dou Xiao Qian okay see sour and a hunty
huh 118 yeah
I'm tempted to buy it 156 I know you can
get them for like 70 80 bucks as well
more put thermometer I could actually
use one of those what's this don't think
so
I bet honestly I bet you could use like
the AMPRO of us software with the same
thing because all they do is rebranded I
think it would be an extra effort to
detect yeah I doubt they'd do it yeah so
someone on Twitter told us to look for
10k solids it passes most which breaks
oh yes my anymore switch I'm on switches
so is that um oh I don't know no it's a
fake
so this store we were in last year and
they have a wall behind me has like
resistors capacitors all that stuff
there are math switches along these
shelves case modding there's stuff like
small buttons toggle buttons stuff like
that or not really case mining you do an
electronics product projects with that
and then what else do we have in here a
lot of power switches power buttons for
just electronics projects toggle buttons
up here power supply power 9 volt 12
volt so forth see if we can find any
SMDs that are interesting and these are
all resistors resistor resistor is mr.
this entire wall is just resistors all
of it
this all SMDs actually these might not
be what are these far side so this
entire shelf which is about as wide as
our studio wall for the set at home this
entire shelf is all resistors like
there's a whole shelf of that basically
something I would never survive in the
US without RadioShack resistors Hughes's
Jesus yeah oh yeah cool this would be
man this would have been useful for
building our fan testing rig yeah all
this stuff you do it ordered all the
stuff on digi-key pretty huge markup
because like so I just bought
where's a 4-pin they see a 4-pin out
here this I just bought two of these
from digi-key for probably yeah that's
right two NTD six cents yeah I
definitely paid like double digits
pennies in the u.s. so this let me yeah
in the US I definitely paid like at
least 30 or 40 cents yeah that's crazy
I wish we had this kind of stuff in the
US but it would never survive yeah you
can build your own circuit boards pretty
easily here yeah so if you want to build
your own small motherboard yeah you
could you could actually do it yeah ESP
header row USB header or HDMI I just
like unconnected so this one is about
four bucks at home and here it's 130
which divided by three is gonna be
roughly the same I think actually
divided by 33 yeah four bucks same exact
price actually 390 versus about four so
not actually a better deal sadly
otherwise I'd be buying a lot of it
smuggling at home so that's its captain
tape though that's cool only see that
really on online stores so this is last
year we came through here so we came
through here last year and found a bunch
of small like laptop components and fans
here you go it's like this stuff over
here is there's like a Acer laptop fan
replace and say I think these might be
model numbers
yeah model numbers and these run under
ten bucks this one's about ten dollars
or so and that's actually really not bad
240 pretty good so well under $10
Asus laptop fan replacement wears a risk
Sasha do you know what uh what laptop
these guys here they used to spawns Oh
like are these model numbers of the
laptops or there's the fancy part
numbers looks like that's model numbers
of laptops and those are all old models
yeah the old models I mean they're
pretty thick too right yeah that's a
nicer one because I was wondering like
if you're trying to replace a fan on one
of the newer laptops that seems like not
actually a too bad of a price yeah but I
think these these are like big laptops
those like yeah okay I think like all
the newer laptops and the fans are
pretty right what is this power supply
or something is it looks like an engine
it's a power supply I didn't know this
exists yeah I didn't know this existed
we didn't see it last year huh this is
kind of cool
is there more down there Earth Train
maybe okay so some some local brand mice
and keyboards here Alcatraz by
Armageddon I guess Armageddon is a brand
it's called Alcatraz or something
x-craft
to x-craft Pro quantum Z 7000 I guess
that's the name of the model
so here's keep this in mind right there
it is
if you enter that kind of what is the
actual I expect so respects we have we
have to a scroll and click button so
basically middle mouse button right
click left click DPI switch search to
kind of see I guess that's fine
CPI switch our a forward button back
button finger grip hand seven high fees
yeah yeah the coolest thing I've seen so
far I just looking cool assault solar
basically cameras and access plays with
toys let's go any moment no it's pretty
cool actually it's cooler than saw the
other stuff we saw so we found solar bug
solar bug is 300 MTD which is 9 bucks or
so something like that so my I think I'm
actually gonna pick that up so basically
it's got like just a I guess a simple
solar panel or sensor on it and he
shined a light on it and it walks pretty
straightforward I think this is actually
a legitimate this I'm pretty sure that's
licensed isn't it isn't the movie called
transforming oh it actually does
transform though into a dinosaur t-rex
if it works it's cool how much does that
one how much is the transforming
transforming solar robot 500 MTD sad
actually
is not bad that's full
so what is this the prep clip param
param ice 508 and it's designed in
Germany allegedly we also have some I
guess hack job German from potentially a
translator do they work okay so we have
cheat chargers we're testing their this
functionality how's that yeah Qi charger
benchmark no good Hello Kitty doesn't
work wow that's really disappointing
that's the only one worth buying
alright so couple things to point out
here we're basically right now we just
came down into the basement of I don't
know under the street if it's Street to
have a basement that's where we are up
top we saw some components some SMDs
like all the resistors things like that
we saw test equipment so a thermocouple
reader and EMA anemometer stuff like
that here there's a couple other cool
things so heat guns are pretty common
tools for tube bending things like that
if you've seen this stuff something
really particularly new but I guess the
cool thing is that you can actually buy
it in purse and not need to order it
this is a power supply this is a
benchtop power supply and you can
typically sound like voltage and current
it looks like it has two sets of outputs
maybe I'd have to look closer but so
you've got that and then heat gun one of
these is 1,400 watts I think you have 14
40 watt heat gun over there really not
bad prices I don't see them listed at
the front but I'll see SMD rework
station so it's a workstation of course
surface mount devices
HECO soldering station soldering iron
soldering kit we have a lot of soldering
stuff up top and I think inside there's
some components and SMD so let's take a
quick look at those see what's inside
the store as well so this is just a this
I feel like right now I'm in the
technology equivalent of a Michaels or
something as unlike the fabric store
because you just have spools of anything
from any color cable you want you can
get it here so cable spools more cables
pre-wrapped for you behind the camera
some uninteresting stuff doesn't even
film but SATA connectors things like
that normal stuff small screwdrivers
lots and lots of zip ties which we could
actually use a local zip tie supplier
for our PC mods more spools of cables
like I said it's basically a Michaels
equivalent for PC hardware or at least
wires and hardware in general there's
more yr sleeving
if you want a like a paracord it's
leaving for your wiring I guess you
could get that here off a spool - that's
actually kind of cool so it's another
wall of test devices and my favorite one
here has pointed out to me by the team
is the multi input thermometer for
senior citizens this is the biggest
possible thermocouple reader I've it I
think that you could create 28,500 MTD
which comes out to about 863 US dollars
unfortunately can't read the text with
it so I don't know what's special about
it to make it that much money other than
the fact that it's gigantic I'm guessing
it's it's got probably tighter
tolerances or something or it's just
like hey what did you call it in
jitterbug jitterbug there okay well
reader other devices on the wall they're
current clamps up here so prova is one
of the brands on the on the wall up here
these are giant not particularly what
you want for PC testing but there are
some tighter one so there's a 30 90 to
tes apparently
clamp meter yeah so this is a this was
just discovered this is a PCI debug card
so as you can see it's got a segments
seven segment display so you can read
out your postcode error codes on here
and it's got a couple of LEDs as well
but you just hook it into a PCI slot and
I guess if the board doesn't have a
segment display you can read that here
unfortunately we could not find a PCIe
one so kind of limited in the use cases
okay so another one just discovered this
hissa
and I guess what is this exactly an is a
is it PCI to i/o say it is PCI right I
think you can either use it on PCI or is
a yeah so yeah yes okay so if you have a
device that is is a compatible it's a
new standard you haven't heard about it
yet so now is a or PCIe I guess debug
cards got the debug LEDs on it again and
I say if you don't know came out before
PCI well before AGP well before PCIe one
of the oldest graphic standards maybe
maybe the oldest I think for a and inert
connectors I think that was the first
yeah so this is pretty interesting this
is a soldering station for phones so I
think specifically for flash memory so
if you had say X gigabytes 32 gigabytes
on your phone we brought in a memory
module for 64 128 or something can
desolder here remove it and give the new
one put on basically upgrade station or
phones that's it that's it for the tour
of the digital Plaza 2018 edition like I
said earlier check the GB pricing video
for some more specific information and
my attempt at speaking a little bit of
Mandarin otherwise they were watches
always patreon.com/scishow his ex
outside directly gonna store that gamer
taxes net to pick up one of our mod mats
or other products on the store and check
back very soon for all of our copy tax
coverage I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
