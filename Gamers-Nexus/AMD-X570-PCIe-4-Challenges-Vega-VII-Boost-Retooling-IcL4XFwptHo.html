CES 2019 AMD has had some of the biggest
announcements of the show thus far
including the card behind me Vega 7 and
this is a seven nanometer Vega product
that we we have a bit of details on a
bit more depth than what was seen in the
keynote by AMD's ELISA sous we're gonna
be going through that today rise in 3000
series we don't have any product details
but we have some top-level stuff that we
can go through as well for Andy's
showcase at CES 2019 before that this
video is brought to you by the gigabyte
z3 90 ARS master motherboard which comes
equipped with one of the more powerful
z3 90 V RMS for heavier overclocks on
the new 9th gen intel cpus the ARS
master is also one of the few
motherboards with a real heatsink this
generation featuring a mix of high
surface area fins and looks oriented
hover blocks oh and it's also got
updated RDV illumination learn more at
the link below so starting with the card
behind me with Vega first of all get you
the the release date in the pricing
looking like February and $700 for that
one performance it's supposed to compete
roughly with the 2080 of course trust
but verify we'll test it when we get it
but generally it's looking like that
should be about where it falls and if
you look at our benchmark numbers for
the recent 2060 you'll see that the 64
card Vega 64 Falls around the 2070
performance 2060 2070 somewhere in there
so 2080 seems reasonable as a target for
Vega 7 for the spec 60 see use you can
compute pretty much everything else from
the Cu count so you can get core count
and ROPS I thinks 128 Rob's will try and
put a table up on the screen for you if
you want the hard specs and data for
what the card will have internally GCN's
not getting any it's not GC on sticks or
anything it's still same GC n it's
getting some retooling and tuning though
and some of that tuning this is new
information for you will be how boost
functions we don't have specifics on it
I asked a few times and all I can tell
you is that boost will be retooled so
we'll see what that means later as far
as the clocks 1450 megahertz is the
target base clock boost is TBD peak
clock is different from boost so that's
like a burst like a temporary spike it
can peak to one point or to 1800
megahertz and he converts a gigahertz
there's some reason so eight
hundred megahertz versus 1450 bass boost
TBD it'll be lower than peak and I asked
about overclocking via BIOS locks all
that stuff as far as we are aware today
from the Andy representatives we spoke
to today it is our understanding that V
BIOS and overclocking capabilities
should pretty much mirror Thank You 56
64 that's not counting things like
voltage I don't have voltage numbers for
you theoretically one would guess it
might be a lower operating voltage at a
given clock because moving the seven
nanometer new process but we don't have
a hard number for you V BIOS will as I
noted a not be locked though this card
speaking of E virus does not have a
switch on it I think there might be a V
bio switch on the final reference card
we'll see but there's not one here today
TDP they're looking at probably three
hundred Watts not final it does have two
8-pin connectors AMD has some room to go
up or down depending on how they feel
competitively they could raise that a
bit if they feel like it makes more
sense to get some some more frequency as
opposed to lower power consumption so
TDP is not finalized we probably round
300 watts and that'll power the base and
boost I asked about the the rate the
voltage regulator module we don't have
details yet on the reference designs BRM
mosfet control or anything like that the
cooler we have information on because in
front of me and i can look at it and the
cooler the backplate looks like exactly
the same as the previous Vega back
plates the assembly is has a distinct
lack of screws if you look at the
previous and video coverage we had and
probably a lack of glue so that's a good
thing but triple fan axial cooler which
is interesting it is a normal to slot
and I think yes to slot it's a bit
taller though for the PCB than the than
the actual expansion slot so we'll see
where that goes with the custom PCBs
later memory 16 gigabytes HP m2hb m2 is
very expensive when we talked about Vega
previously we saw somewhere around $150
at the time of talking about it that
price has fluctuated so I 150 bucks to
make a Vega 56 or 64 card with the HBM
to that it had on it at the time so that
contributes to the $700 price point of
the Vega 7 card that we're looking at
here today so that gives you the basics
I there are some targeted architecture
changes I asked for specific specifics
we did not get any yet so a targeted arc
change
is the memory controller doubles in size
but I other than that power management
things like that may change we'll find
out closer to launch I suppose for other
stuff anti-aliasing should be really
interesting for testing so the charts
that were shown were often we were told
they were max settings for the internal
testing that AMD did all we heard was
max settings what it really meant was
maximum preset so for Rainbow six siege
we don't know I
someone can validate for me in the
comments but maximum preset
anti-aliasing I'm not sure what that set
to but in theory Vegas 7 should be good
with anti-aliasing because heavily
memory bandwidth intensive so that is a
good targeted test that we'll be looking
at when we got the card in our hands if
you're into anti-aliasing at high
numbers this might be an interesting one
to look at and other than that hbm's
writing out 2 gigabits per second you
can calculate the rest of the the
numbers from there we'll have a table
for you
voltage TD TV to be determined as I said
and then I that covers that and the
video card on the CPU side so everything
that was discussed at the next horizon
event is still valid there's no new
information architectural yun rise in
3000 series I have some information on
how the PCIe and motherboard situation
is going to work and this is not
official from AMD a lot of this so in
speaking with some of our sources here
at the show who work at the hardware
companies the manufacturers we've
learned that x5 70 is the biggest point
of holdups so is AMD going to launch
3000 C's with X 570 or are they going to
launch earlier and just you have X 470
to work with so that's the biggest point
of consideration for Andi right now for
the Rison 3000 series launch and the
asain mid mid year for launch we've
heard around June from the the partners
but that could change as the specs get
finalized X 570 though as I said biggest
point of holdup and then PCIe gen 4 is
the next biggest thing to talk about for
3000 series so PCIe gen 4 will be on the
new Rison 3000 series processors now
technically speaking you're not really
going to be exceeding bandwidth of Gen 3
presently with even a Titan RT X but
there is an argument for future use
cases and there's an argument for
threaded per epoch use cases where
you're using a lot more GPUs and if
Brij then that could be potentially
useful so gen4 from a bandwidth
standpoint not the most important but it
is important to start doing it sooner
rather than later
so X 570 will have Gen 4 it'll be going
through the CPU the chipset as we
understand it will be gen 3 and Gen 2
for general-purpose Gen 4 will not be on
the chipset but also not important for
the chipset and also PC is IG will
likely be adopting AMD as the reference
platform for PCIe 4 which is an
important move for AMD and then the the
biggest challenge here with existing x4
70 boards is going to be anything muxing
or dealing with like a pecs or PL x chip
for example because with pecs and PL x
or muc sirs for PCIe lanes you're
dealing with splitting the lanes and
sort of faking an x 16 or x8 set up for
the PCIe lanes so in those instances the
MUX errs and the PAX chips would have to
be updated for the X 5 X 4 so many
boards if motherboard vendors want to go
backwards and do that to support PCI you
Jun 4 so if you're dealing with anything
that does pecks MOX you know of PCIe
lanes you could run into issues with
PCIe Jun 4 coming out of the cpu going
into one of those and then not being up
to spec so other than that x4 70 will
work with 3000 series it'll have to be
flashed but other than that it's it's 4
PCIe if you're using a Gen 3 card which
is all of them then you just drop it
into the x4 70 board the CPU will down
step to Gen 3 so it's not like there's
any compatibility concern there which is
good the biggest concern is just going
to be the end points on the PCIe
electrically so physically nothing
should really change on the motherboard
for the most part but that all be
validated as they launch so I think that
that should get you some new information
on the boards that you might not have
had previously it's just a question of
does XYZ Sony come out with three
thousand threes and I would hope the
answer is yes because it's better for
the market if they do that so oh and
also export 7e could theoretically be
updated for Gen 4 support it's just a
matter of if the board vendors do it and
they might have some validation concerns
so that covers it
that's the and e presence at CES 2019
