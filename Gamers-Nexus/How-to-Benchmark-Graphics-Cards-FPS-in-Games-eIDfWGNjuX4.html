Nexus tonight today we're talking about
how to benchmark your video card this is
something we do for games like evolve we
test various video cards and determine
what the frame rate is at different
settings in the game so high settings
low settings things like that with your
AMD and NVIDIA card this is not too
difficult to do as a user if you just
want to see how your results compared to
ours that way you can sort of see going
forward what you should expect in games
when we benchmark them and you don't own
them yet and that sort of saves you
money in determining if your system can
run a game to a reasonable frame rate so
to this end you really don't need that
much in terms of software you can
download fraps which is free for the
benchmarking utility you pay more for
the video but don't bother with that cuz
shadowplay has replaced it just download
the free version and use the
benchmarking logging utility download
fraps download fraps with an F and that
is a frame rate analyzer
looking at the log files that perhaps
produces so you need those two tools and
then after that you really just use your
games that you already have or synthetic
benchmarks and so the public benchmarks
are by definition not real world so
they're not going to be as accurate
representing your video cards performs
in a real world environment like metro
2033 might be but they are very
consistent and they reduce variance in
testing so by reducing variants were
able to get a more stable understanding
of how the video card performs and this
is especially important when
benchmarking overclocked because when
you overclock the video card you are
running the risk of introducing
instability and using a constant test
platform will eliminate that one
software side variable when benchmarking
using synthetic platforms you also run
the risk of not invoking the boost clock
accurately fir mark is one of these
tools so don't use fir mark anywhere
going forward for the most part because
it is not actually an accurate
representation of how the video card
performs because the boost clock won't
work as it is designed to do in order to
test a game and get the frame rate in a
game like evolve which we just did you
run fraps go to the fps tab enable
logging setup for 60 or 120 seconds
that'll give you a solid baseline
honestly 60 is pretty reliable for this
application you set that set the
location
where the file is saved and then play
the game prove it try to pick a defined
course that you can repeat several times
without too much variance introduced in
the form of combat or dynamic elements
in the game
once you've repeated this a few times do
it three four parity you drop the log
file into fraps and you can look at the
average FPS the 1% low fps and the
minimum FPS minimum and Max fps are
basically items you can discard because
they are outliers and they're not really
going to be a good measurement or
understanding of how the card performs
1% low and 0.1% are very good items to
replace the minimum fps because it's
looking at the 1% low time of your
framerate so if you have 30 frames per
second one percent of the time meaning
1% out of 60 seconds you get 30 FPS
that's that's a more accurate idea of
when you get drops in your gameplay
aside from these items you can sort of
drop it into a spreadsheet or something
like that and sort of combine your data
I get the averages and then see how the
card performs and post it online and
tell us how it does compared to our
benchmarks that way we can accumulate
data let us know your cpu your platform
and then other readers will be able to
tell how their systems will perform if
theirs aren't identical to our test
bench so that is the baseline of how to
run a framerate test when running fraps
you'll see items like frame x frame
latency fps min max low all that stuff
hit the link in the description below
for full detail on what all those things
mean it's not too complicated but it's
complicated enough that showing you in
video is really not going to be too
conducive to learning so that is how to
benchmark your games at a very basic
level hopefully that helps you figure
out how well your cards will perform so
you can let us know and let other
readers know how they're performing and
that is all for this video we will see
you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
