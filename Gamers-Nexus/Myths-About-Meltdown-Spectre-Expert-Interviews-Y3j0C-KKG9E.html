vulnerable processors to the meltdown
and specter attacks were created it's
also the year that the discoverer or one
of them of those attacks was born fast
forward to today January 2018 and we
have industry luminaries like linus
torvalds not not not that linus no
disrespect
saying things like the intel patch for
meltdown are quote complete and utter
garbage probably while waving his middle
finger around as he often does before

scenes videos as we release them once or
twice a month
learn more at the link in the
description below it's been nearly a
month since major news that broke on the
meltdown and spectre exploits and the
tech press along with all of the users
in the space are still swarming like an
upturned anthill trying to figure out
what exactly is going on Intel is one of
those ants they've released a couple of
patches now some of which have actually
been detrimental and they've had to
recall them and AMD arm Apple pretty
much everyone has put out some kind of
patch Microsoft all of them because
everyone at some level is affected by
meltdown inspector basically anyone who
is using out of order processing on
their CPU which would include phones
tablets laptops desktops servers
anything you can think of the most part
smartwatches as well I suppose so we
wanted to come back to that topic and
see where we are today now that it's
been a month what's been going on what's
the current state of things and in doing
so we realized this is a pretty complex
topic let's bring in some experts so we
reached out to several of the
researchers who were initially credited
with the discovery of meltdown inspector
and we greatly appreciate their time and
responding to our questions to clarify
how these exploits affect you and to
what extent they
have been addressed or resolved and
where they are today so we'll be also
addressing some misconceptions on
specter and meltdown we basically said
to the researchers here's your
opportunity have you seen any commentary
online that you find either mislead or
misguided or inversely have you seen
anything that's been left out of the
discussion so we've got all that today
along with a bit of a timeline for a
preview of this we have a great quote
from cyber s technology who stated to us
with respect to Spectre it became
obvious that CPU software aka micro code
is not being developed with the same
level of quality as the hardware at
least at Intel so were you talking about
that more as well we should start with
some terminology here there's a common
phrase that is used pertaining to
meltdown and Spector and that phrase is
a side channel attack which I'm going to
read a definition from a brief by the
European Union Agency for information
security this brief says that a side
channel attack is quote an exploit
observable and measurable with
computational side effects to extract
infer otherwise unavailable secret
information and data side channel
attacks are well known to be used
against cryptographic operations while
addressing this term we should also
address the idea of speculative
execution this is something we discussed
in our first meltdown inspector
explanation video and it's worth coming
back to because in speaking with the
researchers we've learned that one of
the biggest misconceptions that's been
going around with all this is the idea
of that speculative execution itself is
the exploit or is the bad thing in all
facts and reality speculative execution
is what allows us with modern processors
to achieve at the level of performance
that we can achieve basically everyone
uses it it inspector effects everything
basically going back to 1995 so this is
a big deal and speculative execution is
in all those things because it's an
accelerator it allow us CPUs to more or
less step ahead of their current queue
they can think ahead by looking at
what's going on now what has gone
in the past in this situation what do we
think is going to happen next and then
the CPU will try and predict or preempt
as the key word is that next task it's
possible that in doing so that next task
never occurs it might be a wasted
preemption step however the upside is
significant and losing a couple of
cycles every now and then because you
predicted something incorrectly as the
CPU is far less of a hit to performance
than the gains because of how accurate
it often is so speculative execution
itself is actually a good thing
Spectre is the specifically named attack
that is sort of branded and leverages
speculative execution as an entry or an
attack vector to work its way into the
data stream more or less which is where
you get your exposure in terms of
security vulnerabilities so difference
there between spectre and speculative
execution this has been around for more
than 20 years and is why we see the
attacks so wide reaching the most
comprehensive hub of information on
meltdown in Spectre is the website
hosted by gratz University of Technology
in Austria this is home to one of the
research teams that discovered and
reported the issues to Intel and that's
one of because there are no fewer than
three other teams acknowledged by grads
in their independently discovered and
reported vulnerabilities over the past
few months we've assembled a rough
timeline of events with the aid of some
research from other outlets that you can
find on our website linked in the
description below in the article of this
but for purposes of the video let's
focus on the email exchanges with these
researchers who are obviously experts in
the field and some of the best people to
talk to you right now about meltdown and
Spectre first off we spoke with anders
fogh of GData GData is one of the first
if not the first firm to publicly talk
about and draw attention to potential
abuse of speculative execution as an
attack vector they also have one of the
more detailed and early blog posts about
these attack vectors we further spoke
with cyber s technology CTO Verner house
and architect Thomas pressure we also
spoke as Michael Schwartz of gratz
University who discovered meltdown
apparently separately from these others
so multiple researchers at once working
independently of one another coming to
similar or the same conclusions and in
our separate emails with them they all
pretty much agree on what's going on
the meltdown attack comm website that's
widely sourced is from the team that
Michael Schwartz is on so we've got his
answers as well the questions and
answers will be truncated for video you
want to see the full questions and
answers again article below we'll have
them without any cuts at all we first
asked whether Spector the exploit with
the least public focus requires physical
access to execute we read some early
reports and user comments on videos that
suggested Spector needed physical i/o
access and all three research teams
replied to tell us that no neither
meltdown nor Spector required physical
access to quote anders fogh of GData
they are purely software that just
utilized how the hardware works
referring to the exploits house and
pressure of cyber is explained to us
that meltdown inspector only need code
to execute on the victim machine but
noted that physical access is not
required
Schwartz of Graz University reminded us
that spectra can be mounted from
JavaScript thus in the browser and
therefore requires no physical access so
in short no an attacker doesn't need
physical access to your computer for
spectre to work which is one of the main
misconceptions that has been around
regarding inspector the next question we
asked whether Spector could be executed
remotely so this would be for example
via browser this is important because if
it can execute through JavaScript
JavaScript is everywhere basically every
website you visit uses some amount of
JavaScript for the most part especially
anything with an ad network which is 90
plus percent of the Internet so if it
can be executed via browsers or hijacked
ad networks it's a concern meltdown
inspector have both been proven to work
with JavaScript and a compromised
website or a malicious website could
therefore be used as an attack vector or
a compromised ad network which is
actually somewhat common so we wanted to
ask about that GData tells us that that
browse
vendors have been made of aware of the
attack and that many of them have
already released updates so if your
browser has recently received an
annoying icon that says hey it's time to
update it's time to update just you're
gonna lose your tabs it's okay you'll
get them back it's probably a good idea
to update though it'll protect you later
GData also noted that kpti or kernel
page table isolation will work well
against meltdown specifically from a
browser and suggested using kpti and
updating browsers where relevant for
example with linux as your OS and g data
also emphasized the following further
current versions of Spectre and meltdown
are members of the class of timing
attacks other timing attacks have been
shown to be launched a ball over the
network even without JavaScript
thus it is theoretically possible that
we'll see such attacks in the future my
personal opinion is that this is more
likely to be an academic exercise than a
real-world vector regarding the same
question the group at Cypress replied
and they stated similarly the good news
is that browser vendors have already
rolled out patches addressing the
vulnerabilities and continued to state
that an attacker needs good quality
timing information in order to be able
to detect traces of a misled speculative
execution and caches so it sounds like
this has been somewhat addressed with
the browser updates now this is still a
concern as we'll see going through all
of this information but the immediate
severity of it has been at least
somewhat mitigated with the browser
patches we haven't yet gotten to
hardware level issues though and we'll
get there as far as common
misconceptions we asked the researchers
what online commentary they'd seen that
seems misguided or seem to misunderstand
the core story here G data noted that
speculative execution is used as an
attack vector but in and of itself is
not an attack something we clarified
earlier G data also further emphasized
that quote Specter style attacks can be
launched without speculative execution
but would usually require the presence
of a classic software bug even in the
absence of software bugs and speculative
execution we can do scary things with
side channels
see the earlier side-channel definition
for that house and pressure also
highlighted that spectate of execution
again as a standalone feature is not a
bad thing nor is using cash both are
required for modern-day performance that
we see out of our CPUs doesn't matter if
it's AMD in teller arm they all need
those advantages to get the performance
we see today they also need to
essentially reaaargh attack for the
future but we'll see where they go with
that the Cypress team noted that quote
requests for the replacement of all
processors currently in use are unduly
exaggerated and further stated having a
vulnerable CPU does not imply that the
system it can be readily compromised
which is also a good bit of
level-headedness injected it into the
conversation so out of all this the good
news from what the researchers tell us
is that meltdown has very obvious
changes that can be made and are being
worked on at least for future
architectures whether or not we can get
them in today the other bit of good news
is that these things can be made to
resolve the problem at a hardware level
and nip it in the bud so to speak and
the researchers believe this will lead
to future processors not being
vulnerable to the same types of attacks
we're seeing today and to be clear
meltdown inspector don't really have any
proven real-world attacks yet we know
that it's possible to do them the
researchers have all released their own
proofs of concept or discussion
conceptually of what can happen but
whether or not specter meltdown have
been used at a wide scale is either
unknown or it just hasn't happened we're
also told that the linux kpti and other
patches are recommended as an effective
protection against meltdown Spectre
currently has stopgap solutions proposed
and will likely require more testing and
research to close up and then finally on
the more negative side of things
Schwartz highlighted for us that the
specter and meltdown attacks can bypass
sandboxing or virtualization so if you
have JavaScript code from a browser or
from a browser application that is
usually contained within an isolated
sandbox it is capable of breaking out of
that sandbox and attacking the hosts
this is the nature of the spectra and
meltdown attacks so it does that by
reaching outside of the sandbox and then
if you have stuff going on in the rest
of the machine you potentially grant
code execution to untrusted code that's
running through the browser or wherever
its source is from so that's a bit of a
concern but again this is under the
attempt of being addressed with current
patches to at least mitigate browser
concerns via browser updates and then
Microsoft has its own updates Linux has
its kernel page table isolation so
everyone's working on a solution as for
potentially overlooked aspects of
meltdown inspector GData noted that
meltdown is quote surely the more
dangerous one fortunately it is also the
easier problem to fix spectre in my
opinion will in variations be with us
for a very long time but it'll probably
lose importance with time as we figure
out better approximations for a solution
sigh Buress expressed disappointment and
how little information has been revealed
about low-level details for meltdown and
noted a quote for example initially I
postulated that presence in l1 would be
required but now I am fairly confident
that any memory location can be read the
memory subsystem is rather opaque and it
would be nice to have some insight this
is probably irrelevant from a security
perspective but it could help writing
more efficient code they further stated
with respect to Spector it became
obvious that CPU architecture aka micro
code is not being developed the same
level of quality as the hardware at
least at Intel what I find irritating is
that enabling three new MSR capabilities
related to branch prediction can trigger
reboots
ok I'm oversimplifying a bit they
concluded with the public is left
wondering about what is really going on
which certainly does not increase my
confidence in a solution so this is
specifically referring to Intel's
patches that they push recently where
were some systems like Haswell and broad
wealth systems were experiencing reboots
or other instability in the environment
and those patches at this point have
been more or less recalled Intel has
actually requested that their partners
stop pushing them through official
channels so that's where we stand within
tiles
patches for the time being as for wider
reaching impact we queried GData about
the extent to which AMD is affected
because we know that intel is affected
by meltdown we know that everyone's
affected by Spectre but what is the
impact of meltdown on AMD specifically
so GData noted that AMD appears to be
unaffected by meltdown and called
meltdown the more severe of the two
issues GData also noted that handy is
affected by spectre and as our mobile
devices arm and so forth but they
further speculated that there likely
isn't much difference in severity
between Intel and AMD with regard to
spectre specifically spectre isn't as
bad as meltdown from what we've been
told but can still fully expose higher
privilege system memory and quote
shouldn't be taken lightly as for
responses to meltdown inspector coming
to public the vendors had about two
hundred days to respond to the attacks
before researchers went public with
their information thus far most vendors
have shipped patches of various
functional states some causing issues on
specific CPUs but overall G data
believes that the defenders did well in
their reactions and emphasized the
complexity of these decades-old issues
some of the proposed changes constitute
some of the biggest overall changes to
operating systems in the last decade and
they were pulled off in about six months
which GData says is impressive and says
I think there's room for improvement
both for software fixes I'm actively
researching this and hardware fixes in
terms of security benefit and
performance costs further stating as for
intel's patches they certainly are not
good solutions but it's probably all
they can do it'll take time for CPUs to
fully pass all these issues the only
real solution is waiting for new
architectures that all fully resolved
things at least what we know of today
and new things will arise as always CPUs
take years to develop
looking at long timelines 18 months for
some of the recent CPUs and that gets
even worse as you introduce new
architectures or depart from existing
architectures or rework existing designs
to quote the GData group again they seem
to think that the microcode updates
we've seen from Intel are likely to be
features meant for development being
exposed
to operating system vendors and used for
something they were never meant to do so
this is looking like at this point it's
a matter of the hardware vendors and the
OS or software vendors working together
to try and piecemeal together a solution
for the time being which is why you're
gonna see some instability and some of
those patches or some nebulous
performance depend on what type of
applications you use
now speaking of performance we also
asked the researchers about this and it
seems the general belief is that
performance impacts will not be
significant or potentially even
noticeable for the average consumer
which seems reasonable but also noted
that the high-end users which our
interpretation here based on their
response would be xoc type users anyone
fighting for clocks and for higher
scores to rank higher and competitive
overclocking or anything like that
those types of users may feel a bit of
pain because they're obviously concerned
that to some extent about security
depending on what kind of environment
you're in and then even more so about
absolute speed so that's something to
think about but in terms of overall
performance penalty the biggest hit is
going to come two specific types of the
enterprise and data center applications
which we're not covering today because
that's not really our focus or core
competency however from a consumer
standpoint nothing to worry about too
much then update all your browsers and
everything else as soon as you can and
then from a gaming standpoint you might
lose some performance it just it's gonna
depend on which CPU you're on and how it
has been patched it's to deal with these
issues so that's largely going to be a
CPU dependent thin and it will depend a
bit on the games as well so potentially
some downside there though from what
they're telling us but the big focus is
on updating browsers so recap here
there's no real evidence that these have
been used in the wild to attack anyone
yet and everyone's working together to
try and fix it manufacturers have a lot
more to worry about right now than
consumers they're the ones you have to
push out the patches you just download
them obviously you want to get some that
are stable though so you don't need to
worry too much immediately but everyone
is affected by specter Intel and the arm
basically anything modern
and Intel is primarily affected by
meltdown with no real evidence that AMD
has significant concerns regarding
meltdown specifically software patches
remain an effective stopgap solution
until there are firm hardware solutions
in the future looking a couple years out
as we move to new architectures at which
point the research to believe that this
issue should be largely resolved for
gamers and overclockers there might be a
bit of a performance cost for the added
security
but Intel did have a 200 day grace
period where they were alerted to
meltdown and the public announcement
came later along with some Paget so
they're working on it but we'll see what
happens as it's all ironed out what is
embarrassing is that Intel has had a
number of patches so far that I've
proven just generally unstable if you
have a has well abroad well system you
might experience rebooting you should
probably roll back your patches as for
the answer of where are we now
we're somewhere between the problem
being revealed and a stable solution
we're not quite there yet but we're also
not left hopeless the progress being
made is admirable thus far again these
are major operating system overhauls in
some cases especially with linux and
they've been pulled off in a matter of
six months as some of the biggest
changes in a decade from what we've been
to hold so that's a pretty massive
achievement but there's still more work
to be done
so for consumers what you should do
right now is update things as the
updates roll out and if you experience
instability contact whoever pushed the
update and hopefully it'll get resolved
with your reports but that's it for this
one
