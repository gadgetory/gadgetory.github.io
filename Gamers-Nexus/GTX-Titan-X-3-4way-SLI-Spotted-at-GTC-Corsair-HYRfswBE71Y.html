nexus and i just wanted to show off a
few high performance pcs that we
encountered at gtc 2015 the GPU
technology conference hosted in San Jose
and we also encountered one of these
items at Corsairs offices which there
will be separate content online shortly
for that visit so during the Titan X
announcement shortly thereafter nvidia
also unveiled what is called the dev box
and this is something that Jensen
announced up on stage the CEO of nvidia
and the dev box is effectively a $15,000
a high-performance pc that is not
intended for gamers it's it's meant for
computing tasks simulation high quality
renders and things of that nature so to
this end really not something you're
looking at as a gamer even remotely they
actually custom build these they
individually build and ship each order
so it is not a mass production run and
the dep box i believe is equipped with
either three or four titan axes it's
it's a lot of graphics power so that was
seen at the corsair headquarters not far
from here and the dev box is already
known we just thought we'd show a video
of one in existence on the show floor
itself we saw three gtx titan x's
running a flex demo and flex is one of
Nvidia's technologies its i believe part
of the game works suite and it is used
for physics processing its developers
can plug into it to make very accurate
very detailed physics effects so in the
instance of the shop floors demo it was
a water effect they've also shown cereal
bowls and milk and things like that in
the past it's demonstrating this so this
was operating on three GTX Titan axes
one of them was doing the simulation and
the other two were performing additional
support of tasks so pretty cool just to
see things working in an SLI capacity of
course but nothing major here just
thought I'd show there's to everyone
because it is a brand new card and
a lot of them is neat one thing I notice
in looking at the SLI tight and axes was
the limited space between each one so
you may remember in the article the news
article I mentioned that the backplate
was ditched on the Titan X and this was
done specifically for airflow purposes
in sli configurations the 980 had a back
plate with a removable piece to allow
greater airflow in sli configs but in
this instance they just dropped to
completely you can see why here because
if you had a back plate on there it just
it would be suffocating the first or
second card if you had three so those
are just some high-performance pcs I
thought I'd show off pretty cool stuff
we'll have more on tight necks and other
high-end graphics chips in the near
future as in probably next week so do
stay tuned for that and I will see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
