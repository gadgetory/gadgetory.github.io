nexus dotnet we are here in sapphire
sweet i'm joined by ed Crisler from
sapphire he is the north american PR and
marketing manager and the objective of
this video is to look at all the
different cooler options because looking
at different GPUs and video cards there
are a lot of options between price
points people get confused they they
look at these things and even with our
own product line they look and they see
dual-x tri-x vapor-x vapor-x tri-x they
see all these different descriptions and
that confuses people it really it really
messes with their minds they're like
what do I buy so let's make this simple
let's break this down real simple the
dual action try x-series these are
essentially we've taken the default PCB
the reference design from AMD and we
said yeah this is a nice bill but the
coolers not good enough throwing that
away put our own cooler on it now dual
extra tri-x will tell you how many fans
are involved but this is a simple heat
pipe cooler like anybody's used to using
so a good reference design with a heat
pipe cooler this keeps the cost really
close to a standard reference cost and
gives you the same performance with
cooler quieter operation but what if you
want a bit more what if you yet you need
to be a little cooler and a little
quieter than that well that's where the
vapor x comes in we take and we add
vapor chamber technology to the actual
cooler so this reduces the heat further
allows it to be even quieter and then
with some of the high-end stuff we do
extra features like we take the PCB and
redesign it or we've been the chip so we
get a little better overclocked from
them or in the case of our 290 290x we
actually added a PCB cooler to it so
essentially when you go to buy what you
have to decide is do I need to save a
little money get good performance and
fairly quiet operation or do I want much
quieter and cooler operation and spend
thirty forty dollars more the choice is
really based on the need and the budget
that's available now we do offer two
other well one other selection and
that's our special models for example we
have the ultimate which is a completely
fanless cooler
and then we have our ITX card which is
small form-factor card so you've got a
lot of options and that's what we've
tried to do is make sure that the gamer
has the options he needs to pick the
card that's the perfect fit for the
build he wants to do so on the on some
of these cards we saw some exposed pcs
mx-5s copper so on the on the 290 and
290x vapor-x what we have done is and
you guys will have a close-up of this
I'm sure what we have done is we've
actually exposed the copper in the core
of the PCB and put a heat sink on it now
this sounds like it why well it's
pulling heat out of the middle of the
card so we're able to actually draw out
heat that before nobody has ever touched
as near as we can tell in our testing
this is good for about 3 degrees
centigrade now that doesn't sound like a
lot but that's three degrees centigrade
essentially for free so it's a it's a
really neat little idea i like the
concept i'm hoping we'll see more models
with it in the future the end result
though has been really good for us it's
worked out really well for the way we
want the cooler to perform what about
the vapor chamber well the vapor chamber
is that the big advantage of the vapor x
and that that's what i mentioned it's
the reason it's called vapor x as we put
vapor chamber technology into this it's
funny i hate to do this i could do a
little marketing on you here you have to
understand when you look at most video
card coolers today eighty percent of the
designs were designs we pioneered we
were one of the first companies to use
heat pipe cooling we were the first
company ever to use vapor chamber
cooling on a video card or the first
company to use expose PCB coulis so we
take that cooling seriously for gamers
we want to give them the coolest
quietest card possible of course no new
AMD GP is right now we'll have more news
on that shortly so right now we're just
looking at the existing lineup check
links in the description below for more
details on sapphire will have some blown
out pictures of the of the cooler so
that's interesting to look at and thank
you for your time we'll see you all next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
