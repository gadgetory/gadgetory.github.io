and I'm with Vince aka kingpin so we
actually we were just in a fight over
the J overclocking war and I'm sorry man
I didn't mean for it to go that far haha
we're here to look at I guess first
we're doing a lab tour it's great pretty
informal this is just gonna walk me
through everything here and we'll talk
about it a bit and then we have more
content that will do on maybe like
laughing a CPU or looking at the King
1020 ATT is we're also gonna have a
secret project from EVGA at the end of
this video so make sure you watch all
the way to the end to see some secret
upcoming projects they're working on
before that this video is brought to you
by iFixit and the manta driver kit the
iFixit manta driver kit is built out as
a generalized tool for repairs of all
types with a focus on game console
repairs by including those strange
proprietary bits phone repair bits
laptop repair bits and more the bent a
driver kit includes tri Wayne bits
spanners positive Drive game bits torch
security bits and everything else for
general tech repair click the link below
to learn more
so this you're using for laughing the
CPUs yeah we use this laughing machine
for laughing the CPUs we use it for
lapping the bottom of the pots to make
them nice and flat like I told you when
I blown my pots to ten yes he loves to
put dents in the bottom of them so I
like tin is we should you should know
antennas the evil genius behind some of
the KP mods yes
so so 10 gives you the screwed up pots
yo and then you fix them with this and
then I fix them with this and you can
put a really nice lap on your CPUs using
this machine so how do we can we turn it
on yeah absolutely
this is basically a sander so basically
it has a stone platter and it's very
flat and it's and it rotates forward and
backwards variable speed and you use is
this your sanding paper yeah 200 grit
400 grit 800 1200 mm just kind of go
through all the grits right have you
seen any improvement on your thermal
since going to this from manual like is
it or is just faster definitely the
biggest improvement I see is actually
the thermal grease you know it will
crack less okay and there'll be less
grease between the two services it will
all push out right and then you can run
for a very long time
okay cool I'll check it with two hundred
first try to take all the nickel off
with like 200 or 400 and then just just
find that bit with the higher grade cool
and I think we'll we'll probably do a
video on this later with I brought a 99
8 exe cool I can show you how to use it
cool and we have a I have some thermal
data from before so complete stock and
we can do a test after as well I'll show
the improvement nice yeah nice what's
what's what's this
what's the tank okay well this is an
ultrasonic cleaner and basically what
this does is it uses cavitation bubbles
which are produced through transducers
inside the tank okay to to clean and
scrub the parts so you just have some
power connectors in there right out or
some 10 project in there these are these
are our parts holders we put the part on
top of that because if the parts on the
bottom of the tank
yeah the scrubbing action can't ok so
there's actually a basket there's a
basket that goes in here but to put a
motherboard and you can't use the basket
at me okay
so use this I guess I like to clean off
the Vaseline from the board's stuff like
that
man they come out so nice though the
boards will come out like spotless no
grease no residue no anything with with
a circuit board now with the circuit
board you you want to use IPA mmm but I
got to say IPA is a little bit dangerous
okay obviously it's very flammable right
so so any any flammable solvents like
IPA or acetone you have to be really
careful because of the fumes right hey
do you do you have anything we can drop
in here now and then come back at the
end of the video or something oh yeah
definitely
let's uh let's find something we can
drop in I guess okay let me try to find
the nastiest one
yeah this one's pretty nasty this one's
pretty nasty I think green 3z 390 yes
so there's a bunch of Vaseline on the
caps down there under the socket I guess
another thermal grease kpx everywhere
you have to protect the pins when you do
this sir no I'll put it in just like
this okay so it's not that aggressive
again oh and the board itself doesn't
move it's just basically have the liquid
to clean
right okay cool let's try it out I guess
let's bring it over so let's just put
this baby in here like that
oh yeah it's it's a known thing on
YouTube oh man you've gotta watch the
sound on this okay so we've got the
board in here is there anything anything
safety-wise wait to be worried about
okay well you we are using you can use
detergent degreaser you can use water
you can use solvents we are using
isopropyl alcohol and actually it is not
recommended to put IPA in an ultrasonic
cleaner because there's definitely a
fire hazards okay I want to make sure
people know that so don't don't do this
at home very clear about that yeah for
this industry IPA is good because it
doesn't really leave any residue I'm not
a circuit board and gives you a nice
clean product right this this is
actually I got this from a Japanese
overclocker
Japanese make such cool stuff you know
those guys are my inspiration for a lot
when I point I start so what is it it's
a it's a vice pres so you put the
motherboard in and you don't need you
don't need like a typical mounting
mechanism what yeah this you just put
the pot inside and I'll get right down
to the board that's cool this is very
nice for no IHS mmm because you can
Center the pop right on the die right
and then this is a I see the insulation
here what was this for this was actually
an old block that we tested with Robo
clocker long time ago that's insane it's
very heavy
so there are there micro fans endure big
time okay there's a lot of channels and
the it was getting uh Ellen to pumped
into it originally yes okay Ellen to
would shoot straight down the center and
then back out so does it this this can
run off ninety nine eighty five point
eight no problem nice she just get a
machined by yeah we come on locally are
we custom-made yeah
and then you know what this is neat Oh
No
okay is it is it a direct I you're okay
like that cool so you keep the the
outside of the IHS so that you have the
pressure correct and the pressure that's
really cool that's neat and the pressure
is correct and the plane of the CPU will
stay nice and way and then you just
mount this direct this is another valve
block for Robo this can also run 5.8
that's pretty impressive
yeah that smaller block yeah right damn
that's actually we had these custom-made
- yeah that's it's kind of something
interesting I don't really show that
stuff
yeah we do we test a lot of things
internally here well it's it's probably
uh I would imagine a little bit safer to
do it this way so you don't risk
cracking the die is not the concern yeah
you you can't correct the die like this
the measurements are perfect Yeah right
the Z height is everything's measuring
perfect what about this machine yeah
okay yeah this was before before we got
this machine so basically I just I cut
the socket out of the motherboard right
I've been doing this for a very long
time because this hopes to counter the
deflection that you get so when you put
the CPU in the socket you know they make
them a little bit I want to say the
surface is not flat to begin with so
when you put it in there - it will sort
of like balance out with the deflection
from that from the ilm when you could
when you know that's it down this way I
can get a better lapping hand lapping on
that I see okay so you just
would you socket it and then put it in
the lap okay cool it gives you a nice
nice and I guess when you do it by hand
you just tape the sandpaper to a surface
or something yeah like everybody does
right tape it to the table or at some
glass and pen lap is this anything
noteworthy that's the bracket for the
new icon pot which I have over
I'd like to show that yeah we can do
that my new stuff should we is this tens
lab over here yeah okay he's got lots of
interesting stuff okay sure so this is
this is ten everyone ten you were on
camera with us previously yep so this is
your section of the lab it's in the same
room with kingpin which I guess yeah
just across the goes the wall alright so
what uh where do we start
I see well we're gonna go flick from
here basically like when we designed the
new VGA card like in this case when you
try kingpin like we do all of like
different function testing and
everything so like this one of the test
rigs so pretty much everything as normal
retail pack and then we like test the
display you a function test like the
clocks to the power pretty much
everything you normally do for
developing no to be Jake are cool
so right now you just have a stock
kingpin card hooked up yep so I'm doing
some testing with there like radiator as
it like do do all the radiator and this
is all on extra nine dartboard so like
and test can take like the whole day
yeah so just runs like that and then I
do other things cool what about a is
this like a solder station yeah it's
like a resort area like when I need to
do some mods or like fix some cars like
I have the microscope soldering iron and
then air station so I can quickly and
easily replace things like yeah I can
tell that you work in a in a lab because
you have labeled your property yeah
basically that was the power supply but
like long time ago because that was the
first EVGA power supply we were working
on study and that's basically how all
the EVGA business for the power supplies
started from did you have to label it
tends property because
KP was stealing it well I sometimes had
no power supply and like like a like oh
I just wore this power supply and then I
don't see that for like a couple of
weeks cool so what about anything here
you want to talk about is this like an
active project um that's like just some
prototyping parts
when I need likes a quick cooler like I
all use that instead of like Monty and
that's yeah a lot of time like if I just
want to do a quick check there's
something together quickly cool this
this is is this the plate from the yeah
that's actually a plate for the memory
the hybrid cooler right and it helps to
maintain memory temperature so you have
the thermal pads and it's basically
similar part used on f2w three on
kington cards because we want like when
when you change the air cooler to the
hybrid you don't want to have your
memory or VRM get too hot right
otherwise you are kind of like you
making better temperatures for GPU but
going backwards on everything else yeah
so to make sure everything is balanced
like we actually have the fan on the vrm
side to blow the air through and then
you have like the memory play the
backplate with the thermal pads so it's
not as easy as just change the color to
the like water pump and right okay
can you tell me anything about these
girls yeah I have some scopes like like
the lower speed one the higher speed
once over to when I need two more
channels to like capture the complex
like maybe like our sequence and stuff
like that then I'll need more channels
and I use those codes but me my main
scope is on the desk over there
so like shown right here yep so it's
smaller scope and like you can pretty
much do a lot of things as well and this
is like one of the test stations I hear
so it's mounted like opposite direction
so I can quickly connect the VGA cards
and do different testing problems what
do you do on this I Syria I do some
voltage union and you can see like the
probe coop - s.coups I calibrate and
make sure all the settings are correct
so pretty much like when we compare like
doing the precision development and when
we like make sure the voltage reading is
correct like this pretty much this stuff
we use okay
and then like make sure that software
like to apply the correction calibration
so so for Regions match the hardware
right right because actually on the
kingpin card we implement additional
circuitry so the readings correct for
both voltage
power what about what about this scope
over here
well that's logic analyzer so the scope
will imagine analog signals so like if
you want to see like complex waveforms
you will use those to do scope ok the
logic analyzer
is it doesn't show you the waveform but
it also will show like timing so like if
you have like maybe like SPI like biased
communication between the GPU and the
SPI chip like you will use logic
analyzer to make sure the data is
correct ok so it doesn't care about
their like signal integrity but it cares
about the timing so it's also hair like
scope usually have like two channels
four channels like like high-end scopes
have up to eight channels this thing
have 288 channels so you can connect
pretty much to whole motherboard and
write whatever you want cool what's on
top of it is is this just part of the
power supply and there's the current
probe like so like if I really want to
measure the input power this is the
thing I use okay so this thing can
measure 150 m/s this is just a clamp is
it yes so you put the wire through and
then you close the clamp and then it's
at a scrap I've ever seen yeah it's
pretty expensive to like this one goes
to 150 amps and like when I do in the
full measurement form like a VGA card I
use three of these because I want to
have independent reading each connector
right so I can make sure it's everything
is balanced right cool
oh that's there like you know like
everybody's doing the voltage mods like
using the blue trim parts and like to
adjust the voltages and things so like
sometimes you want more accuracy and you
want to actually know what's the value
you set when you're doing the voltage
mode so this is essentially the same
thing but but you can read the wall at
the resistance directly so this is
hundred K steps 10 K 1 K and you just
dial in like oh okay you want okay so
you said this one zero this one zero how
often you use this we use it from time
to time like like for example for the
Titan RT expansion will like use this to
set the exactly settings you you want
right so and then you just connect this
two wires to usual like voltage more
coins okay I'm cool I see a Titan RTI
crowd up there
yeah that's what all the loops from
what's left of it yeah so there is the
rest of it in a bench right now or
something well we did some testing and
like kingpin already posted the results
for portrayal okay we have a couple of
results but that's still working
projects oh well that was like when we
were checking for the z3 90 dark during
the development like what signals go
where like so I printed just bigger like
bigger schematic layout of the board so
like I can see like oh this signal goes
there these signals go there it's just
more make work flow more simple yep yeah
that's pretty cool and then I recognize
this as that the test bench the bench
trade for the z3 $90 yeah and also like
we use the same same idea for the the x2
99 that was the first board to come and
it's just and just this is the PCB I Pro
PCB but that one doesn't have any PCB
traces and it's so we can bundle
together right retail package is there
anything special this card up here that
the oldest card I could find before like
the recycle everything that g-force to
256 okay with the DDR memory it's just
before you are working at EVGA yes yeah
I just keep it like as a piece of memory
like when all the g4 stuff started right
yeah that's the high speed scope like
similar to others just goes to seven
gears like very expensive very high
speed but I use it only for the special
purpose so it's hidden there in the rack
doesn't move in you know all of the
comments are going to be about cable
management well its desire to be better
yeah we are the same problem it's like
we do the same for actually the gigabyte
OSI lab we we saw the same comments I
think you know it's a I don't think
people are normally too serious about it
but this is clearly look you can spend a
lot of time like optimize and make
everything you don't really use it like
that way right when like we designed the
new erm like that's the test board I
made I've actually have my name on yeah
I see the Cuban card which gave Tino
kington Kington yeah this is 780ti 780ti
okay so did you just do read for fun i
guess 'sir yeah because no nobody ever
supposed to see this so alright like
secret project we made like one day like
five okay so this was just for when you
did like initial testing of the design
yeah okay you can see like actually live
erm controller is on the page board so
it's kind of like yeah yeah right there
yeah cool so that's a that's tin side of
the lab I guess we'll go over to the
last section
we're at infants currently got his
display case the twenty atti kpk up yep
and maybe an Ellen to pot so let's
switch the mics back and move over there
we got a lot of Ellen to equipment
obviously yeah whole rack of it you want
to talk about the wall of it it's what
the history this is our sort of display
case it's like our Hall of Fame there's
some some products in here weren't were
created before me and ten got here but
okay
most of these are during our during our
era is this a chronological order random
order
no of course I set it up perfectly yeah
this is chronological on K peas so five
five eighty classified 680 is this
before you or were you here this was
actually our first project together
welcome ATX 580 classified that's death
tins first design and it was our first
opportunity getting
cool that blower cooler design is insane
it's really effective that is it yeah
this card overclocked is good too so is
this an exhaust up here is it it looks
like it's channeled out the top in the
back if you yeah it's mad portion but
most of it goes out the eye okay cool
and then the 680 classified what
frequency do they have left
well the 680 plus what is the first car
to get two gears on GPU yeah okay
like we pushed like over like 20 80
almost 100 later yeah we hit 2,100 on
that and we'll actually beat was at 7970
what's Radeon Cardon I think that's
about the right era yeah yeah it was
killing all the Nvidia cards but we got
this one too 2100 took all the records
with it cool so this one I recognize
this is around when I started paying
attention to the classifieds 780
classified was sort of the the dawn of
the KP card and this this design I
recognize I remember the the clear
shroud I think we started seeing that at
CES or something
carbon clear and yeah which so out of
all these designs is there is there one
that you feel the most attached to like
I mean it's or even out of be is like
what's if I stole something from you
today which would you want me to to
least steal not that I'm planning
anything I would say probably the 780ti
is special really is this first one okay
it's the first KP card yeah and this
card was actually very very good it was
much better than anything else that was
out what's the red baseplate stock
that's it's it looks like it has a red
base plate in there so yeah that's
exactly their stock okay cool so then
you have the 980 which we we did a lot
of videos on that one and on that one
what are the stuff down here like what
is this that's our next generation a
power
he just just designed that about a year
year and a half ago yeah basically we've
had the red one that's the generation
four so whatever it is that in 2014 and
then because like the new GPUs had
higher power consumption we designed the
new one so also it's not so easy to get
even but nowadays so all the evbot
functionality is integrated on the new e
power right you just have one package
and everything it does everything and
that's easy button there yeah okay cool
I never actually I have never actually
seen eve'ybody
it's a rare bird it's a rare bird cool
when was that last made the you remember
that was made in show Minos days over a
year eight years ago
essentially like all the new regulations
for the voltage control and like
settings adjustments and everything is
limited
basically central to the software and
we're nvidia will allow you so what was
our solution back then but now you have
the software which can do similar things
so you don't really need Eva got as much
right that's one of the reasons why we
didn't actually pursue to make new
really but right right what about the
center here so let's let's talk about
this thing let's talk about the SRS or -
- yeah well this board has got some
history man this was not our design of
course this history nose board let's
start with this just because it's sticky
and a half so well this is a custom
chipset pod I made and when I would run
four-way SLI the chipset would be
blocked so I made this pot where the
cooling surface is actually under the
GPU and can it work pretty good and then
we what's angle it so you can see in the
pot because it still got like the same
there's a lot of vaseline on that board
it's not the same just like it just got
benches yeah you still have this the
drilled out areas
like increased surface area just like a
GP or CPU pot and you were telling me
earlier that this was actually necessary
right like the chipset pot yeah a
hundred percent 100 percent just needed
this to get the FSB up mmm
right right so I think I mean now on
modern boards you really don't need much
for the chipset at all yeah that's
pretty cool see that custom-made and
then what's the black gunk on top of the
plate there's a there was a temperature
probe in there and that kind of kept it
in place I say I've got some tech just
to secure it so dual socket board and
this one predated the SRX yeah this yeah
the first one right imagine imagine two
CPU pots at one two three four plus this
did you help Corrine yeah well usually
been disadvantaged with four GPUs and
two CPU hats like whoa look at the split
job basically I was pouring GPU cards
and Vince was managing the system and
for my chips apart that's cool because
when you bench it together you need to
you know how much you pour it onto and
you expect like some temperature drop
from that somebody else poriyal I'm
doing you don't know I like you this is
racket looking at the screen then your
temperature will call back and your
system will stop running right it was a
lot of fun and also a lot of frustration
with what you should do is recommission
this into Robo clock or that's what you
should do
it's a terrible idea but it would be
cool yeah this is this this is a gnarly
system man this is definitely still to
this day this is probably the most
complex and most difficult thing I've
ever overclocked yeah I believe it
doesn't that many pots to manage thanks
with joking around like oh like this new
during the hard way is too easy to run
right you said the settings you get the
temperature that seems record done
record done so now we have the secret
project part of the lab tour yeah
basically we discussed like stuff about
this r2 and we're also working about
this beast so this is the board which
will work with Intel Xeon 3175
X CPU and essentially this is a
workstation CPU which will allow
overclocking and we still early steps on
this project so this is the board PCB on
it yeah this is the the first look I
think there so yeah we didn't show this
before and essentially it will be a
workstation board in e-atx format so you
can fit in the standard workstation case
but also support overclocking so you can
see the vrm so what is the I see a year
on six six teams right yeah we opted for
the one team per channel so you have six
channels and six teams it redeems on
each side essentially you have tangia
Network PCI Express up to 48 claims from
CPU and all the connectivity you would
expect from the normal rotation board
was you to m2 was the dim choice mostly
for a form factor of the board or
forever yes pretty much we have to
rotate the circuit similar to z3 90 dark
so you can fit everything together in
there without increasing the height of
the board so because essentially we also
wanted to support normal server xeon
cpus like some golden Platinum's
and since this board would fit both
purposes for over comer and former
station if you have like 4k or 8k or
five key yes processing system as
opposed to the they exist the other two
boards are like the Dominus and the
gigabyte one are like 14 by 14 I think
they're pretty big yeah you only add a
special case yeah yeah there's like this
one supports one power supply so you
have 24 pin right angle and
for eight pins for the CPU power and
their vrm is gonna be right here I guess
yep okay yep so you have all these
phases for vrm and separate power
regulators for the memory so what is
once you get the PCB in like this what's
the next step in the process well
essentially we'll help get the PCB
assembled with all the components so we
can do the initial bring up yes the
functions make sure everything's okay
then do the bias board so we like do the
memory tuning power tuning all that and
after that we'll see like if
compatibility issues like we will try
different devices different J cards
right a different memory do all that
testing and then board will be ready
cool cool so there's the sr3 yeah I like
working name right now is there pretty
dark so we'll see how that goes okay so
we'll we'll check back on this I guess
closer to whenever it's gonna launch
yeah we're playing around Computex time
to show something working and go

cool there's your first look at past my
three then other than that uh see the
award oh yeah that's Innovation Award
yeah I prize right there and I love that
thing yeah that was those four Robo
clocker
yeah last year 2018 I think yeah when I
got that I posted it on my Instagram I'm
so proud of it and then on the right
side it's just some motherboard so what
is what is the Slap Chop
The Slap Chop is a product from like a
long time ago in the US the infomercials
it's an EVGA product no it's not a WJ
products it's just some junk us
infomercial product that's kind of a
joke it's dirtying the brand still
pretty fun
all right what uh anything else you want
to show on this side of the room I guess
let's do the let's at least just show I
guess the main bench which which bench
do you use the most frequently this one
this one over here yeah so let's show
this off is that the new pot you're
talking about yep this is my pretty much
where I live I mean I spend majority of
my days here testing everything
everything in anything these are my new
pots that's the t-rex for the CPU this
is the icon for the GPU nobody's seen
this yet actually okay I haven't sold it
so that's the brand new one yeah this is
for RTX GPUs it's got the bigger cooling
surface which actually is much better
this is that that's the main change you
made I guess improved internals - okay
it's got a little more speed and control
so what uh internally is it a visible
difference
oh yeah it's it's got more surface area
a trained eye I guess it has the surface
area where you need it up towards the
front of the die okay right the action
is more quick that makes sense because
these GPUs heat up what was the net you
said icon or it's called icon I can't
that's painful is this gonna be are you
selling this one or you just for
internal use no I'm gonna start selling
it maybe next week X okay I'm gonna put
it up for sale kingpin : calm yep
keeping cool well if anyone wants to get
in - Alan - yeah so I have to ask you
because I bought some stuff from your
website and you sent a note to my best
event or my best fan I think right
Johnny Johnny Cage reference yeah so is
that actually a reference to Johnny Cage
yeah I'd look at it alright cuz we had
we got that in and I think I showed it
on streem I was like like guys I don't
know what this reference is - and so on
yeah someone pointed it out
so is its since sure if it was
intentional I wanted to get it I wanted
to ship it that day I want yeah too
quick but actually I was gonna put in a
picture like a portrait picture with its
sign just like the friendship yeah but I
just wanted to ship it out quickly wrote
something nice well it's in the set
background now really yeah has been
there for a couple months okay cool so
that's the lab will have at least one
more video here and I guess I think I
think we need to also pull out the board
that we've been cleaning this whole
video and definitely didn't just put it
on pause and we're gonna start cleaning
it right now yeah so we'll check that
board ask well okay so we're back after
the rest of the lab tour and this has
now finished we ran it through twice I
think yep so like maybe 20 minutes or
something like that - ten minutes cycles
okay so let's let's pull it out see how
it looks
we got Jesus she's gonna be really clean
and all the Vaseline is gonna be gone
gone gone nice that is very clean oh
yeah so all the stuff that was on the
caps over here is now gone yeah does it
just drip into like a lower container
well we what we do isn't 101 when the
when the solvent gets really dirty we
can drain it okay but you can reuse it
over and over again a lot of the
sediment stuff in there right kind of
sink to the bottom okay cool so now
what's next all right let me just blow
this off clean it blow it out the
hallway
you can see that it basically removed
all the Vaseline yeah that's great it's
nice and dry now
nice yeah so oh and all the pace that
was on the socket yeah it's pretty much
gone there's a little bit of residue
right that's nothing
cool it's clean so there's your
ultrasonic cleaned board I guess
ready for reuse yeah and now you don't
have an excuse when the when the
engineers get the board's back if it's
dirty they hate my greasy hard well
thanks for watching subscribe for more
you can check out convinced off that
kingpin cooling calm right and of course
go to patreon.com/scishow and exit
topside directly thank you for joining
me
yeah Vince and Tim thank you we'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
