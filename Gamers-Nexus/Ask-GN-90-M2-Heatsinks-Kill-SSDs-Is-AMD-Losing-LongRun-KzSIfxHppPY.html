Jian episode this one has some really
good questions in it and I had to reach
out actually to an expert in solid state
storage dancer one of the questions so
we have a quote from him addressing
thermals and whether or not some of the
cooling solutions for SSDs are complete
 so that's why we're going to
talk about today
something we've covered a bit in the
past - lots of other questions though as
always leave your questions in the
comment section below for consideration
for the next time we're shooting three
today this is the first of three the
second one will also go live on the main
channel within hopefully plus or minus
18 hours of this one and then the third
one is going on the patreon discord
before that this video is brought to you
by NZXT is new h 500 case which we
recently found to have an impressively
effective cooling setup that is entirely
negative pressure when stock the H 500
is the successor of the s 340 and s 340
a lead offering high build quality
that's all steel and glass and kael
management features that are also a top
class for the $70 compact mid tower case
age 500 is a part of NZXT Zanu H series
lineup which also features options from
mini ITX
micro ATX and full ATX builds learn more
at the link of the description below
very quick note first this shirt the
teal logo version the teal teardown logo
we just restocked it in tri-blend and
cotton and we have a few women's bean
acts in stock as well so trying to cover
everyone there and when I say a few I
mean it's like eight but that should
cover us for a while so if you've wanted
one of these design shirts they are in
stock on store documents necks and snap
they were out of stock for a few weeks
thank you very much for supporting the
design it seems very popular so the
first question is from coulomb's 5 who
says why are you willing to answer a
lawsuit question on NVIDIA but not AMD
and the heavily advertised primitive
shaders and discard and HPCC for the
Vega architecture none of them have
materialized in the current discrete
vega cards i've been asking for months
but you refuse to touch the subject well
I mean probably I didn't see the
question which is probably because your
persecution complex was just so big that
I couldn't see it past the persecution
complex
guys first of all we get
tens of thousands of comments a week so
there's a giant difference between
refusing to answer and literally not
seeing it and I did check and I think
you've asked this question twice and
both of those videos were really popular
so I didn't see it or if I did to see it
I didn't feel qualified to talk about it
at the time it's one of those two things
so you kind of pushed that persecution
issue you have to the side room oh and
maybe talk to someone about that
the thing is regarding your actual
question we've gotten that dealt with
the question of am these primitive
shaders and discarding HPCC for bigger
architecture not materializing in the
current discreet cards I would agree
that proto shader discard and draw
stream bending rasterization all that
stuff those core features we actually
did talk about them first of all in the
Vega content but yeah I would agree that
they didn't really fully materialized as
we were hoping now some of these
features are on the driver side some are
on the game developers so some of AMD's
Vega features require game developer
integration one of the things you didn't
mention here what the hell was it called
it was that I can't remember their name
for it but it was the thing that moves
to FP 16 so it enabled FP 16 processing
when game developers would engage with
that in order to wrap a packed map that
was at rpm rival pack math so FP 16 is
another feature where it's just floating
point 16 it's called 1/2 precision
rather than single precision which would
be 32 FP 32 so you're using fewer
decimal points to calculate things which
is fine you don't always need 32 FP 32
for accuracy for something like a video
game
Chinese depends on what you're
calculating but for a lot of things you
can get away with that P 16 so it was
actually a good idea it's just the
problem is they're relying on game
developers to use it and so that's one
of the big walls there to actual
adoption and I when you're the smaller
vendor of 2 as AMD is anything that
requires the rest of the world to
conform to your thing and actually use
it even if it's a good thing
like rpm anything that requires people
to to leverage your specific technology
when you have you know less than 30
percent market share that's obviously
gonna be an uphill battle Andy has a lot
of battles to fight they it's it's kind
of a chicken or the egg thing they have
to be better to get more adoption and
they have to have more adoption to get
better so it's a it's a really tough
challenge for them and I thought some of
those those features of Vega we're not
going to see for that reason primitive
shader discard is one of the ones that
was more or less canned and I don't have
a great answer for why we haven't talked
about Vega card since they came out
basically because they've never been in
stock since or if they were in stock the
prices were insane so I would advise you
to look back to her Vega 56 and 64
content if you want Vega discussion I
that was several months ago it talked
about it a whole lot then as for
lawsuits I am NOT a legal expert I will
remind you I frankly don't know enough
about this specific situation to comment
on it so the question of why are you
willing to answer one and not the other
is because one was like more cut-and-dry
to me as a non lawyer and I was able to
speak to it and also I never saw your
question the first few times so anyway
whatever that's there's my thoughts on
Vega hopefully some of the actual
information that is useful for you they
had good ideas for it it's just it does
does kind of suck where you know the
some of the good ideas just aren't
feasible to be used on a wide scale
because it requires adoption and vice
versa so it is a very unique challenge
and Andes and a hard spot for it the
next question is from Creighton who says
it has been mentioned that MDOT to nvme
heatsinks may cause degradation to the
drives in some form would using an MDOT
to heatsink such as the one from ekw be
mainly for aesthetic purposes have an
appreciable negative impact
what degrades what processes are
impacted and how does it progress over
time would it be safe to use them in a
showpiece gaming system that is on and
your
the time this is a a very good question
and specifically what I like about it is
that prayed and talks about the use
cases so it's not just a wide sweeping
question of when and how should I use
this thing it's here's how I'm going to
use this thing and for your question
I approached Allen Melvin tano from PC /
Allen Melvin tano is one of the leading
storage reviewers in the space I would
if you ever have SSD questions or you
want to know how good an SSD is I would
point you towards his reviews first as I
think he's one of the forefront experts
in reviewing SSDs and he's from PC /
comm if you want to check them out so
Allen had a great answer and this comes
back to you before I read his answer
this I think this question originates
from something I've said a lot where
we've talked about that ekw b block for
SSDs and the problem is you know you
really don't want to sink the NAND if
you're going to be writing a whole lot
and that's because there is degradation
because then the flash actually prefers
to be warmer while it's doing writes and
if you're a have heard of cold storage
if you are storing it then you want it
to be cold but if it's active you want
to be warm the controller to a point
should be cooler so that it doesn't
throttle but a point of thermal throttle
is rare to hit which is something allen
talk to us let me read you his answer
here Allen said JEDEC rates that's the
group that rates these things jeddak
rates client SSDs with an operating
temperature of 40 degrees Celsius
if you force the flash down closer to
room temperature let's say 25 C then
with the same amount of writing done at
that lower temperature the end-of-life
data retention time will be cut in half
and m2 SSD without a heatsink will
naturally rise above ambient same goes
for SSDs with heat spreaders or heat
spreading labels you may have seen those
some of the stickers are literally heat
spreaders these days and he further says
that they just spread the heat more
evenly which is actually better for
endurance since the flash will also run
slightly warmer even while idle now for
the heat sink and water block problem
the goal of these items is to prevent
thermal throttling during the heavy use
but that is a controller issue not a
flash issue flash loves to be hot while
operating
specifically during writes as
that is what causes the where where the
heatsink and block makers get this wrong
is by having the thermal pad contact on
the flash we want it to only contact the
controller yes the overall temperature
will still run lower less controller
heat conducting to the flash while idle
but at least during a heavy writes the
flash will be able to rise closer to its
preferred temperature without the
heatsink actively pulling it back down
to ambient this is far less of a concern
for a showpiece system that is rarely
writing but I would still recommend the
trimming the thermal pad so that it only
contacts the controller so that is from
allen mal Ventana PC / had a bit more of
a discussion with him he gave me a chart
that hopefully you can put on the screen
at some point during this with some
temperatures power off and active
temperatures that you can look at and
also we talked about overall personal
takes on these heatsink devices for MDOT
- SSDs and Allen noted that generally
throttling is the only active the only
reason to actively cool the SSD on the
controller that is and thermal
throttling on the controller is pretty
hard to do except in benchmarks that
might not be realistic so if you know
you're throttling then it's useful but
if not it might not be worth buying and
things like the the labels that are
built in the heat spreading label is the
built-in heat sinks on some devices like
puck stores had those can do an okay job
in some instances and the main thing is
just you know maybe consider trimming
the thermal pad like Allan was saying so
I think we had one more thing we talked
out here they want to bring up a great
way to deal with a controller
overheating in rare cases like if you
only occasionally hit throttle points on
the SSD controller the great thing to do
is put some thermal pads between the
controller and the motherboard if it's
dual sided or even just on the back side
of the PCB of the SSD and the
motherboard do some other words natural
heatsink it is made of fiberglass and
copper basically so you put a thrown pad
between the controller on the board well
it's the backside of the front side
that'll sink some heat and it's going to
be targeted it won't cool the Nannes
they don't have to worry about that at
all also average case temperature it
tends to be about
/ 30s 3540 C in an environment that's 25
C so just some more information for you
next one is from bitter cynic who says
ask Jenna's Andy still losing in the
long term because of how irrelevant
their progress might be due to the to
the mainstream users due to GPU and ram
prices personally I'm disappointed with
how the potential of rise in Vega ended
up squandered instead of being picked up
by a large portion of gamers forcing the
prices of both old and new Intel and
NVIDIA parts to drop first on GP and RAM
prices yes that was a very it was
unfortunate timing for GP and Ram it
started going up right around when Rison
was coming out if I remember correctly
and when you have a large surge of
people building new systems in the
market as rise and prompted because it's
pretty good architecture for a first
launch actually very good for a first
launch of like a brand new architecture
and so there's going to be an influx a
lot of system builders and to have seat
or GPU and ram prices skyrocket at that
exact moment it's very unfortunate
timing so yeah I would say that's
unfortunate now as far as is AMD losing
in the long term I'm not trying to speak
to the financial side of this I can talk
about to the technological side I'm not
a financial expert I'm not going to
pretend so AMD isn't out of the woods
yet they they had years of being
basically non-existent in the
enthusiasts desktop CPU market and I
think that's pretty agreeable for most
people it was really small market share
for FX especially with bulldozers very
disappointing launch phenom 2 was a
fantastic architecture phenom 2 x6 or
whatever the arc was called a phenom 2
x6 was a really good processor
bulldozers pretty disappointing they
released a lot of refreshes with the FX
line some of them were better than
others and it took time it took like
what 5 years her AMD to get to a point
where they could push something like
Rison and show significant gains so it's
going to take time to recover market
share and so far anecdotally mind you
we've seen our audience just with
affiliate sales because we can see
affiliate revenue distribution via our
Amazon Newaygo the retailer partnerships
so this is anecdotally to our channel to
our channel which I believe is primarily
comprised of gamers for people who do
like the game occasionally at least for
our channel we've seen greater and the
adoption than we've seen ever in the
last like six years and I think we've
had affiliate accounts with these
companies probably six to eight years so
basically since we started doing
affiliate tracking and revenue so we've
seen more referred sales to thin and
part of this is going to be confirmation
bias because the parts we recommend will
tend to be purchased more frequently so
you know it's not a great set of data if
you're trying to analyze the market but
it's good enough for me to look at our
audience and say what are you all buying
and the answer is a lot more Rison than
any time for AMD in the past we've ever
seen ever with like the FX CPUs or the
previous ap use before Raven Ridge so I
would say there AMD although they are
not out of the woods yet they have a ton
of ground to gain still kind of
struggling in the GPU market the CPU
side of AMD has oddly kind of flipped
with the GPU side or suddenly the CPU
side's the strong department and it's
gaining a lot of ground and I think AMD
has a chance here to claw back they've
their semi-custom group is also doing
very well so so many custom designs it's
a a the group that did like the Xbox and
PlayStation and stuff like that and
these also working with China based
companies now for that dianna CPU which
is basically a China only release with a
Zen architecture x86 processor so I
would say overall AMD is doing ok but
the GPS is very weak driver side is not
great on the GPUs it has improved the
AMD red team plus people are going to
freak out and post a comment because
they'll get points and a free shirt if
they do but the fact of the matter is
that the driver side for Andy especially
on the professional side where they will
sometimes encourage professional users
of Radeon cards to use gaming drivers
because they are more up-to-date than
the professional drivers it's a problem
that side I think has the most again
right now
and I'm not sure what's going on in the
rift the Radeon technologies group but
hopefully they can gain some ground back
there so rise and I think is doing well
I think it's carrying the team right now
and Andy's gaining ground with it
threader for two should be very
interesting to look at this is where
right now Andy hasn't gained as much
server market share as you might expect
with epic but enterprise users server
users want something that's tested epics
been out a while now thread rippers been
out a while now for workstation users so
as these second generations roll out I
would expect to see more of an uptick in
their market share than previously just
because it has been tested so the second
generation is something that should have
some more eyes on it than previously if
anyone was either concerned that it
wasn't the embattled tester or tried in
a tough environment or they just didn't
have their eyes on it because it's AMD
an AMD didn't have anything impressive
up until that point so are they still
losing in the long term I can't answer
that question but I would say that Andy
is doing better in the CPU department at
least for our audience for our affiliate
revenue we can track them we've ever
seen for Andy's CPU sales GPU sales are
down and I would imagine part of that
student mining part of that's because
they can't can't get the prices to MSRP
which is a memory price issue as well so
that's a big problem GPU not I'm not
going to sugarcoat it AMD has to do a
lot here they still have a tremendous
amount of debt but they're doing the
right things on at least one side of the
business so let's hope they can do that
on the GPU side as well maybe with Nabi
and Vega 56 is a good card by the way
it's just the price is too high most the
time next question J Brian says have you
guys looked into the possibility
visualizing airflow through cases so I'm
gonna stop here yes we did and one of
our previous asked G ends if you maybe
try Google searching for like I don't
remember the episode number try just ask
GN smoke test and see what comes up the
short of it is we've done it we've even
published some of it it was ages ago
we did plumber smoke pellets so you
light them on fire and it makes a bunch
of smoke the reason I did that
because it was it didn't have any
moisture in it no water vapor so we
didn't have that conduction concern
problem is four components they'll get
kind of slimy and gross if you use water
vapor there's a concern maybe of
shorting something and we've talked to
some companies about some special
solutions for that and right now it's
not feasible but it's something we'll
continue to look into as we get more
space to work with and budget and stuff
like that
the problem is just that it doesn't show
you quite as much as we would all like
it to show you with the method that we
had previously which was the safest also
the method we had previously left the
system smelling awful so you had to test
it outside and then all the parts would
smell like smoke for weeks so anyway
yeah something we've looked into we've
done even and hopefully one day we can
do more rusty Shackelford said Steve I
couldn't help but notice on the back of
my motherboard box it says they're using
superior Japanese capacitors is this
because they are quality capacitors from
the respective company or just an odd
marketing tactic it's actually really
common for companies to boast about
Japanese caps and that's because the
origin of it is that some of the SMD
manufacturers in Japan make some really
high quality SM DS
capacitors being one of those so the
thing I wasn't sure about is I would I
mean one would assume that any country
is capable of housing companies that are
both good and bad at making something so
I would have to assume there's a bad
specific Japanese capacitor model out
there somewhere I think that would be
reasonable to assume so I don't know
that just being a Japanese capacitor is
inherently makes you the best but I did
speak with build Zoid who knows quite a
lot about vrm components and capacitors
and things like that and builds lloyd
noted to me that he's not immediately
aware of any japanese capacitors on
motherboards that are bad so I guess
there is actually some truth to that
marketing despite being marketing from
what I understand from Build Zoid it
sounds like generally speaking it's
pretty safe to assume that they're going
to be better than average in the very
least if not just outright good next
question is
from and that just comes down to who's
manufacturing stuff and Japan happens to
have a lot of small electronics
manufacturers including Omron actually
which we should tour at some point the
next question is from Jeff Lehman he
says hey Steve I just saw an older video
you made about rocket cools copper I
address for the 1151 socket how you test
it with conducts not got me thinking of
how copper reacts with liquid metal in a
bad way have you had any experiences
with bad experiences with it some
reports say the reaction is only
happening above 80 degree Celsius so
first of all between the dye and the
standard IHS the normal Intel I H s
that's nickel-plated so you're not going
to have any really problems there any
reactions that are of a meaningful
impact anything as far as the rock and
cool one so you'll get some tarnishing
on it the liquid metal will basically I
don't know what what the correct
chemical processes that's happening
there but basically if you look at the
underside of the IHS after you applies
them it'll get it'll stain it so it
stains at the color of liquid metal in
our test and we've done a lot of it it
doesn't impact the thermals in any
meaningful way so even though you have
that layer of all the liquid metal there
the thermal performance is functionally
the same it's within our margin of error
or whatever the difference is so I
wouldn't worry about it
the only thing to worry about is
definitely don't use liquid metal with
aluminum it will not like it
you'll get pitting and damage to the
aluminum it's it's pretty bad but it's
okay to use with copper it will stain it
but from our testing the stains don't
seem to impact on all performance and
that's with that's being people who
replace the liquid metal on these things
more than most average users ever would
in the lifetime of the system so I
wouldn't worry about it too much it is
possible for liquid metal to have a bad
chemical reaction with something with
some materials but they are all labeled
on the card that you get with the liquid
metals just read that it's typically
just aluminum but nickel plated you're
totally fine copper just be prepared for
some tarnishing visual tarnishing
performance doesn't seem to be impacted
in our tests and pitting you have to
worry about a bit but that's more of
using it with improper
cereals are incompatible materials which
will be listed on the instructions
hopefully next one of two more I think
is from Nelson panna who says question
what are the what are the things you've
noticed that get harder or easier as the
size of your channel increases and do
you think it's the same for other
channels or other types of channels I'm
going to keep this kind of short easier
learning how to produce content and
learning how to learn just like anything
else as you get better at something you
kind of figure out how you get better at
that thing so learning how to learn is
the is the absolute biggest asset for us
as we continue to grow and do more
things that makes us more efficient at
things it makes me better at talking to
contacts and researching stuff helps us
understand when when should we take
something research it test it and
decipher it versus when should we just
talk to someone who's an expert and get
their information because sometimes if
better work exists you really don't need
to add to it if you think you can't do a
better job than them it's always good to
have more data it's always good to do
more more work on a subject but honestly
time is the biggest resource we have
that we can't get more of and beside
from paying more people but it's not a
linear scaling that's the way YouTube
works sometimes the biggest thing we
can't get more of and sometimes it's
better to just refer to an expert on the
subject and and that will allow us more
time to work on something else so
learning how to do stuff like that's
really important and I would say access
to companies has gotten easier what's
harder keeping up the pace is hard I'm
gonna do it dammit but it's it's really
difficult sometimes the hours are long
you get tired the travel is non-stop for
I don't know eight months out of the
year so that gets harder and that keeps
getting harder because there's more
travel as more people want to bring us
or to events or talk to us so it's stuff
we can handle but I would say keeping up
the pace is the most difficult it's
something I can do though the next thing
is the signal-to-noise ratio and
comments and this is where like the
patreon discord community's been great
because it's a smaller group of people
so
it's easier for me to keep a pulse on
that than the YouTube comments where we
start getting worse signal-to-noise as
more people come in who are maybe less
mature I'll say that our core audience
all of you watching because the problem
is it's not the subscriber base people
who aren't subscribed who've never seen
us who's coming through the side channel
from a another channel that might target
a younger audience or something and
rather than just leave if they don't
like the content they'll start posting
comments that are trolling or attacking
other users personally and that's not
cool and there's not a lot we can do
about it either unfortunately last one
is actually not a question but it was a
great comment I really wanted to read it
to give it some the attention it
deserved this is from lo1 or LOL he said
off topic for memes this is from the
episode where I talked about how we
don't go to parties at events because
they're waste time lol says I wonder
what knocked at Computex parties are
like classical music people walking
around drinking 90% purified water very
quiet and Noctua engineers showing off
their fancy stuff silent auctions of
various Noctua products party games fan
airflow testing and extreme overclocking
with the nhd 15 case mods with Noctua
engineers know that acrylic triangle
will not be enough to hold up the SSD
here's a machined aluminum SSD mount
rated for key three kilograms of load
just made it with my portable laser
cutter Steve's hair cooling mount
revisited with resin 3d printers and the
end is knocked to engineer's blowing you
out of the room with a wall of NF a 12
by 24 hives so just wanted to read that
one for everyone for a good ending as
always you can go to patreon.com/scishow
and axis to get access to the bonus
episode on the main channel we'll have a
second episode whether before after this
one and also get a story I came as next
to sign that to pick one of these shirts
we just restocked the teal tear down
logo and of course we stalled the Mod
mats in stock or actually coming into
stock as I speak right now and I think
that covers it so subscribe for more
leave a question in the comments if you
have one thank you for watching I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
