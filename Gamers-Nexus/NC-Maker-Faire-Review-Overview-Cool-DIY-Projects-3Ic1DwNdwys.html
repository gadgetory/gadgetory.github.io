nexus dotnet and today we're talking
about something a little bit different
it is the maker faire specifically the
North Carolina Maker Faire that I
attended this past weekend as we are
based in North Carolina for those who
don't do not know the Maker Faire is as
the name implies all about making things
it is a DIY festival and the show is
sort of headlines by adam savage of
mythbusters fame in the Bay Area in
California that's where one of the
bigger or the biggest maker faire events
is held and there are other fairs as
well they exist in New York they exist
in Detroit in Austin and now in North
Carolina and the event is all centered
around DIY projects and workshops so a
lot of it is educational or or tutorial
like in nature so they at the the North
Carolina one I went to they taught how
to do electronic soldering and they
taught things like lock picking there
were exhibitors there who weren't
actually selling anything they just had
booth space to show off the cool stuff
they made which often featured things
like LED light panels and and PCBs and
stuff like that and electronics and
robotics so lots of cool stuff this sort
of think of this as a bit of a review of
the event if there's a maker faire near
you a lot of this information will apply
because it is a franchised event and it
is owned by one organization so they are
all effectively supplied in some
capacity by the overhead group but the
North Carolina one is growing pretty
substantially last year it was there was
a lot smaller they had a smaller space
this year they expanded to the
exhibition center at the fairgrounds and
they doubled or rather they surpassed
excuse me their attendance capacity
Justin pre-sales alone over last year so
Justin pre-sales for this year they
surpassed last year's entire attendance
from what I understand so it is growing
quite a bit featured this year like I
said there were two workshops in the
form of lock-picking and soldering there
were also
was a little robotics hockey arena where
is think of it like battle bots except
with hockey and that was predominantly
therefore for kids and for entertainment
so the event in terms of demographic
there are a lot of kids present so if
you've got kids and it's probably a
great type of event to take them to to
teach them about doing things and making
stuff but that said it's it's really for
everyone there's there are a lot of
experts there you can speak to in the
realms of 3d printing or of animatronics
or robotics or software development and
engineering so if you are a professional
or a hobbyist or an enthusiast in any of
those areas of the industry this type of
event is a great place to go to learn
from the experts there are a lot of
colleges present at least at the North
Carolina one NC State is a major sponsor
of that and they are of course one of
the the better engineering schools in
the country and one of the best on the
East Coast so a pretty pretty cool event
there were some issues we had with
registration they were a little bit
abrasive with press registration I
imagine that's because they are small
enough that they don't quite don't quite
know the etiquette for registering press
just yet but i believe they will grow
out of that as the event kind of matures
it's definitely a lot easier for us to
get into things like CES which are more
than 12 times the size so that kind of
gives you perspective of what it takes
to have a good press registration group
but beyond that normal attendance
tickets are like 10 bucks if you are
within a few hours driving range it's
well worth going and checking it out if
you've got stuff to show off it's
probably worth going to check out and
like I said a lot of this applies to the
Maker Faires and other states as well so
generally personally if I were attending
this as just a normal attendee not
covering it I would probably drive a
couple hours I'd maybe go about two
hours three hours to see it and there's
probably one to two hours of content to
look at at this North Carolina Maker
Faire it'd be a little bit more if you
did the workshops like the soldering
workshop or lock-picking workshop solder
eNOS is some
I already know for the website of course
so not something I needed to do but
pretty cool that they were teaching it
and a great opportunity for people who
want to learn so that is all I have to
say about the maker faire this year
