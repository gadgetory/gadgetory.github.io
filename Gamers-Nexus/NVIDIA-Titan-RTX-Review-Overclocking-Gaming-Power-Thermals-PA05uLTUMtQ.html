r-tx for overclocking gaming thermals
and some acoustic performance looking at
the first of the two cards in the lab we
have a third card that just arrived to
trade off for one of our defective units
which was stuck to 1350 megahertz as you
saw in another video so we'll be looking
at SLI after this the Titan r-tx cost
$2,500 outbidding the r-tx 2080 TI by
about two times and being about 500
dollars cheaper than the previous Titan
V flagship in this class it also only
enables an additional for streaming
multiprocessors with for more SMS and
256 more lanes there's not much
performance to be gained in gaming
scenarios from that change so the big
gains are in memory bound applications
as the Titan RT X has 24 gigabytes of
gddr5 from the 11 gigabytes on an RT X
20 atti today though we are going to
focus on overclocking power thermals and
gaming and then we'll look into
production applications later before
that this video is brought to you by us
and the gamers access store you can go
to store dock cameras nexus net to pick
up one of our ceramic mugs
critically-acclaimed mod mats or
educational video card tear down and PCB
anatomy posters that teach the names and
placements of all the key PCB components
learn more at store des cameras XS net
or click the link below getting into
these really briefly then as noted in
the intro the 24 gigabyte frame buffers
it's something that benefits Adobe
premier for example where when we edit
our chart the charts that you see in
this video that are lines over time
those eat a ton of memory the way that
we do them and because it's all cuda
accelerated playback it happens to fall
on the GPU and so there are times where
we'll hit maximum memory allowance on
the card 11 gigabytes or whatever it may
be and run into issues so this is
something that would maybe help in those
scenarios it's also something that would
help in blender for example where if
you're doing blender one of the best
reasons to not use CUDA acceleration in
blender is if you run out of memory on
the GPU if you have a project that is
particularly intensive on memory and
we've had them because our lead video
editor does blender animations for us as
well sometimes we have to push to the
CPU because you can fit more memory
there given the way
CPU and memory configurations work so
those would be the reasons why you would
want something like this as opposed to a
20 80 TI and we're gonna put off
production testing until our TX is fully
enabled in applications like blender or
v-ray or whatever else there may be out
there once they're fully enable then our
TX actually does something unique and
those applications will go through the
tasking but today we are going to
demonstrate gaming performance which is
more or less talking to the users who
take the I just want the best approach
because you should still know you're
getting so we've got sli 2080 TI is in
here and b link is sli it's still using
AFR and we're testing that versus the
titan RTX we have every other device
that's come out this year a few notes a
few places where things have been
retested because far cry for example had
some regression on performance but we'll
talk about that when we get to it other
than that we had one device stock up
1350 megahertz we just had an Nvidia ref
visit us locally fortunately one is in
the area and we traded him a our 13 50
megahertz unit so they can try and
diagnose it get to the bottom of the
issue and we took a new one that's
working fine and we'll continue with our
SLI testing from there so you're really
paying for memory here and that memory
is best applied towards things that
honestly we're not testing today but
there's still a lot of people who want
to buy these things for gaming and
hopefully this will help those people
figure out if it actually makes sense
for you so let's get into it
overclock stepping comes up first you'll
need to know this information to go with
our gaming benchmarks later on the Titan
RT X overclocking process follows the
same steps to the xx atti
and becomes instantly throttled by its
cooler under the out-of-the-box fan
configuration built in to be BIOS for
the fan curves under complete stock
settings we saw an average frequency of
about 1800 megahertz and times by
extreme with a 19 20 megahertz peak
frequency power measured about 280 watts
via gpu-z
that we have separate power measurements
later for some hardware measurements the
fans seem is to stick around 1515 rpm to
maintain the thermal target of 75
degrees in this configuration maximum
power target offset is only 14% extra so
114 percent total leaving us with a
limited amount of room to increase
performance in fact you'd have more room
with some of the high-end over
in 2080 TI's and just a sub mall side
note here percentage is a percentage of
a baseline so if a card is 114 and
another one 125 percent they could
actually be the same wattage like the
same maximum power and watt with
different percentages to keep that in
mind but anyway we ended up at 18 30
megahertz average up 30 megahertz and
that's without any core frequency
offsets we were also instantly
throttling at 88 degrees causing the
clock to bounce around between 1780
megahertz and 1850 mega Hertz once we
started actually applying offsets like +
102 core for example we just started
throttling a few steps later we blasted
the fan speed the 3700 rpm which we can
highlight and that's the maximum speed
and we saw a performance uplift in a
significant fashion right Lisa frequency
at maximum frequency was 20 85 when
around 62 degrees Celsius and finally
the resting point at 20 40 megahertz
peak under sixty six degrees was where
we sat for the core the trouble is that
just like the previous r-tx cards we've
become bound by an overprotective power
target and voltage limitations and then
some of the recall or limitations if you
want better noise levels we might try
and mod V bios to see if we can surpass
this or might just rip one of the shunt
resistors off the board and do build
toy's mod but stay tuned for that anyway
that's our overclock settings for the
tests overclocking is pretty limited on
this one and that's entirely because of
the power limit and gbz was reading
power draw at 330 Watts when overclocked
but the vrm can handle far more than
this as our twenty atti reference PCB
analysis demonstrates and this is the
same PCB as that it's the same card
build joy to analyze for the 2080 TI fu
launch moving on to game benchmarking
next our game benchmarks will start with
Sniper Elite 4 which is one of the
best-built games of the modern API using
DirectX 12 async compute and 4k high
settings that Nvidia Titan RT X ends up
at 112 FPS average with lows at 90 fps
and 87 fps 1% pause your point one
percent low respectively for a
comparison 1080p is an SLI do about 170
FPS average or SLI 2080 TI is do with
210 FPS average we also observed the 20
80 TI at about 180 FPS average
establishing a difference of about 4 FPS
or if you want to do it this way eight
point nine six milliseconds our training
times for the Titan versus nine point
two milliseconds for the 2080 ti we
can't think of many humans if
any who can identify a 240 microsecond
difference in frames a frame interval
overclocked in a Titan r-tx to about
2040 megahertz core gets its 126 FPS
average outperforming the overclocked 20
atti by about by about 3% the next thing
we need to test is mblink Titan RT X's
which will work on immediately after
this though
see our other video for why we got
delayed because one was stuck at 1350
megahertz here's a look at frame x
between the stock Titan RT ax and stock
28 ET i cards as a reminder frame times
of the most accurate representation of
friend frame pacing or the interval of
time from one frame to the next it's
also the best way to objectively
illustrate the raw experience without
averaging both cards perform roughly the
same lower is better and more consistent
is best but these cards are both low in
frame time and consistent in frame time
and NVIDIA has done well with frame time
consistency and pacing for this
generation for the most part and neither
of these cards experience a noteworthy
frame time spike or hey it would be
difficult to tell the two apart for
reference sixteen point six six seven
milliseconds is 60 FPS with a two
milliseconds at about 120 fps what we
care about here is that there's never
more than an 8 millisecond of 12
millisecond deviation from the mean so
the user is unlikely to detect any
hitching or interruption of fluidity
some people call this smoothness
overclocking the Titan RT X introduces
more frame time variants as you'll see
in this line plot but nothing severe
regularly hitting three millisecond
frame time increases over baseline from
seven to ten in some cases but this is
still relatively fluid and basically
unnoticeable to the user F 1 2018 give
us a look at the ego engine with DirectX
11 moving back to the more widespread
API and away from the shining example of
DX 12 that is Sniper Elite 4 for f1 2018
at 4k and ultra high were clearly GPU
bound with high ceilings set by the CPU
and our CPU reviews you'll see FPS as
high as 300 with the right CPU so this
is a good means that really tests the
limits of the GPU and avoid limiting
influence from the CPU this further is
illustrated by the sli 2080 TI is at 169
FPS average clearly pulling away from
the rest of the pack after the Titan RT
X that ends about 110 FPS average stock
placement just ahead of 2080 TI f e is
99 FPS average or the 28 e TI XC ultras
105 FPS average maximally the gap is no
greater than
10% and that reduces to about 5% with a
heavy partner model 20 atti overclocking
the Titan gets it to 118 FPS average
just ahead of the overclock 2080 TI fe
at 114 FPS average at 1440p the
overclock Titan RT X runs at 185 FPS
average and with lows at 87 fps 1%
putting it just above the 2080 TI fe
hybrid overclocked card by about 3% the
Titan RT x card hits 175 PS average one
stock sandwich a net between the
overclocked 2080 TI and stock 2080 TI x
ii ultra at 170 FPS average or stock for
the 2080 TI fe @ 1 60 FPS average
differences are minimal which is
probably expected when considering that
the Titan RT acts only ads for SMS the
GPU moving to 72 SMS from 68 SMS so the
lacking performance makes sense the VM
doesn't really help in games which is
something we all pretty much knew at
this point anyway at 1080 P we clearly
slam into a bottleneck at about 239 PS
average this is becoming CPU bound as a
scenario and so the results here are
relatively meaningless all we learn is
that the CPU can't keep up with these
cards at 1080p no big surprise there
shadow of the Tomb Raider is a DirectX
12 title that's still relatively recent
for this one note that the sli tests
were conducted without anti-aliasing as
TAA causes issues with AFR or alternate
frame rendering as a result of the lack
of previous frame data between the cards
the Titan RT x ends up at 72 FPS average
for stock performance which isn't much
better than the 2080 ti of e to 67 FPS
average the 7.6% uplift here is
undesirable in the face of a 100% price
increase but note again that the bigger
reason to buy this card is for its vram
increase not for any other reason that
all most likely benefit non gaming
applications overclocked and Titan r-tx
puts it at 70 FPS average which is about
the same as overclocking at 28 e TI card
although our 28 ET i was able to push
higher and core clock this is part
silicon lottery and likely part thermal
density as well 1440p the Titan RT X
runs at 119 FPS average stock which is
functionally tied with a 28 e TI f e
unconstrained thermally by way of hybrid
mod the 28 e TI XE ultra sits at 116 FPS
average with a fe at 114 FPS average
overclocked inputs the 28 e TI in the
lead due to higher clocks again with the
Titan RT acts just behind it
128 to 130 FPS average not far from
margin of error at 1080p the cards that
still show scaling and haven't run into
a hard limit yet but we do see the Titan
RT acts in 2080 TI XE ultra and 2080 TI
fe for that matter are all about the
same performance level there's
functionally no difference between these
devices GTA 5 gives us an interesting
spin on results for this one test
adverse at 4k the Titan RT X runs at 93
FPS average outperforming both the stock
and overclocks 2080 TI fe card the 2080
ti XE ultra ends up at 88 FPS average
and would surpass the Titan RT X with an
overclock but overclocking the Titan RT
X gets it to 98 FPS average still
outperformed by the dual GPU classes
above it
although the Titan card looks better
here than in some games it is still
clearly not worthwhile for purely gaming
use cases they can do them just fine the
best in fact but if you're only gaming
there's not a lot of value for you at
1440p the Titan RT ax ends up near the
top at 156 FPS average we're beginning
to become bound by the game engine this
engine frame caps at 180 7.5 FPS making
it impossible to see how much a more
Headroom there is for the sli cards as
an example still the Titan RT x card
stock ranks about even with an RT X 2080
tion overclocked establishing no
meaningful difference we have 1080p
results we'll put them on the screen but
at CPU bound to a point that everything
becomes equal there's nothing to learn
here so let's move on some recent game
updates made it apparent that it was
worth retesting in Far Cry 5 so we reran
the 2080 TI fe numbers for this one the
Titan RT X ends up at 70 FPS average
with the overclocked variants gaining 5
percent performance 273 FPS average the
20 ATT i retested lower than its
original results from a few months ago
placing instead at 66 FPS average with
the XE ultra also tested freshly at 67
FPS average the Titan RT X ends up ahead
at about 6 to 7 percent of a lead when
all are retested on these drivers and
with this newest game update something
here seemed to affect the performance of
the 20 atti so Titan RT ax does end up
in the lead although original testing
would have put the 20 atti in the lead
it's just that's no longer the case with
current game version and other updates
when both are stock 1440p scaling places
the Titan RT acts as 4.9% ahead of the
2080 CIF II scaling that reduces as
resolution reduces here
our original 2080 ti results would have
us at around 126 FPS average although
the new drivers and game update have
impacted scoring and that's why we reran
it we also rear and the 2080 CI for all
the other tests that you saw in here but
those results didn't really seem to
change so far cry 5 for whatever reason
got the biggest change and that's
probably because of game updates 1080p
equalizes results we are becoming CPU
bound here so all the top results are
within reasonable margin of error and
are capped by the CPU for power
consumption testing we're testing
between the wall and the system for
total system draw the test platform is
100% controlled including control over
all of minor voltage rails on the
motherboard the fan quantity the speed
the type and the keyboard and mouse even
and every single other part in the
system power supply of course is also
controlled failure to control even some
of the voltages in the motherboard and
leaving them auto like for the author
smaller voltages that you typically
would overlook in a normal system can
throw off these readings and leave them
inaccurate in some times significant
waste so we control all of that stuff
very heavily
we're also logging over time so that you
can see a proper look that includes
peaks and lows rather than an average
sum for the test this chart is with
ashes of the singularity escalation
under a 4k crazy workload giving us a
real gaming workload to look at power
consumption this pushes the GPU pretty
hard just about to the limits running
the Titan RT X card our total system
power consumption Peaks at 480 watts out
drawing the 20 ATT IFE system by an
additional 24 watts the only thing that
outdrew the Titan RT X card was our
heavily modded Vega 56 contraption which
used a 250% power target to blast power
way pass to the stock allowance putting
that total system power draw at around
640 Watts peak Vega 56 is typically
closer to 350 watts for total system
draw but the Titan RT X card as far as
stock operating cards is heavier in
terms of power requirements than the 28
e TI fe although not by that much but an
additional 24 watts is something to keep
in mind and a lot of that is probably
from the additional memory too
because it is driving a little over two
times the amount of memory as on the
twenty-eighth ETI thermal testing puts
the titan r-tx under load with either
fur mark or 3d marks depending on the
test thermocouples are attached to a hot
spot GDD our six module and a hot spot
MOSFET both are in the centre of the
rest of the SM DS in the area gpu-z is
used for logging the rest of performance
counters at the aida64 for additional
validation for our power virus workload
we monitored a maximum GPU temperature
infirm of about eighty degrees Celsius
with the hottest GTR six module at 76
degrees this is on a functional card so
it wasn't locked to 1350 the MOSFET was
running at around 80 degrees and GPU
temperature here is it's warm definitely
and it will impact frequency we already
know that frequency steps incrementally
with every couple degrees on NVIDIA
architectures so to be in the 80s for
the stock cooler is unimpressive but
also expected this becomes more of a
problem for anyone stacking multiple of
these cards in an array because you no
longer have the argument of being a
blower device that can get rid of all
that heat you're gonna have one fan at
least that a sandwich in a very hot area
with its fan up against the back plate
of another card so that's a point of
concern for you as for the vram
temperature it's completely fine for one
device in an open bench 90 to 95 degrees
is
spec and the mosfet can take 125 to 150
degrees so both are with an operating
spec and even if you put it in a case
it'll be fine it's just once you start
stacking multiple devices you have to
keep an eye out with fire strike
endurance test and we saw a frequency
start at about nineteen thirty five
megahertz when at 40 degrees then drop
to about eighteen thirty megahertz 1845
megahertz and fluctuate based upon core
temperature the temperature seems to hit
about 84 degrees before it lightly
throttles down the clock and hits 80
degrees and tries to stay there overall
this is the final chart for the review
noise for the Titan r-tx runs a 33.9 DBA
level when set to 41% speed which is the
slowest possible
that's much louder than most other
partner models under idle conditions or
low speed conditions at the average fan
speed of 60% we're at forty two point
nine DBA going to 100% pushes us to 58
DBA expect on average to be at around 43
DBA for most you
cases this card is acoustically
outperformed by board partners but
unfortunately no board partner tighten
our TX cards will exist that said you
can stick a water block on this or a
reference 20 atti card cooler on it for
instance because the same PCB so that's
the review for the Titan r-tx as it
stands for gaming and overclocking and
we're gonna take this further for
overclocking so you'll want to check
back soon for that make sure you
subscribe because it will start getting
crazy with these devices the cool thing
with these they have our TX 2080 TI fe
PCBs that means that really as I have
99% certainty that 20 80 TI water blocks
will work on these unmodified so it's
the same PCB it's the same GPU there's
really no reason it shouldn't work as
far as we're aware there is not a single
component that's different so you could
take a water block for a 20 DTI that
already exists throw it on a Titan RT X
and it shouldn't make for some really
fun content which we'll do separately
now that's performance oriented it's
more of a drag race at that point then a
functional or practical look at the
device but it can teach us a few things
about overclocking and how the
architecture and touring scales so
you'll want to check back for that but
as for whether you should buy it
well it's pretty straightforward really
if you're just playing games then the
answer is no because you can get to 20
80 I is for the price of one of these
and we don't necessarily recommend to
that either but if you're spending that
much it's just there's really no
performance to be had now we didn't see
performance regression we did originally
in Far Cry 5 until we reran the 2080 Ti
and then we reran it at every other game
just for certainty results in that
really game pretty much it's the same
but far cry 5 we saw a performance
regression where FPS fell down a bit as
like 8 FP s or something off the top so
that impacts the performance but the
Titan r-tx remain in the lead by a bit
it's like three to seven percent on
average behind the game and that's just
not exciting but to be fair to Nvidia
they haven't marketed this as an extreme
gamer card so this should really just
goes out to people who are thinking of
buying Titan RT X for gaming because it
cost the most and is therefore the best
if you see this video then save yourself
the money get a step down put that money
towards anything else like literally
anything else and this
or just keep it there's nothing wrong
with that either so we're really really
hoping to look at these from a
production standpoint you recently did a
video by Rob Williams contributor here
at workstation contributor on
workstation GPU performance you can
check that out it's about a month ago
we're hoping to revamp that kind of
approach with some of these higher-end
r-tx devices so you'll get a production
look at it just that's gonna take some
