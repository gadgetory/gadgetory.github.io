most expensive thing I've ever taken
apart which is a Titan V that we bought
ourselves for review the testing is all
done at this point we just need to film
that but we're gonna do a teardown here
look at the PCB which is quite
interesting and see what we can learn
about the inner workings of the Titan v
card by Nvidia this is a three thousand
dollar graphics card and hopefully we
get ROI and it doesn't die in the
process but before we get into that this
coverage is brought to you by ifixit.com
and their protec toolkit i fix it as
refreshing they're pro tect toolkit in
time for the holidays you can find a
link in the description below to the
protec toolkit and other toolkits that
iFixit sells we find the protec and
essentials kits to be the most useful
for DIY enthusiasts for the exterior of
the card you can see that it's got this
sort of off beige like like if you took
if you took this box if we took this
white box and maybe left it in the back
of a car for about two or three years
I'd probably look about the color of the
Titan V's shroud so that's why the color
the shroud I guess they're going for
like a champagne color also reminds me
of an old NES so that's what we've got
for the Hat side for the rest of it
though this is just the standard cooler
that nvidia does so we've got the titan
XP and a titan v here next to each other
and it's the same cooler it should be
the same heat sink as well we'll find
out when we take it apart and other than
that I mean yeah all the specs are in
our news video it's no point going over
those let's just take it apart and see
what it looks like underneath so we need
some Phillips heads and I think that's
about all we're gonna need I'll take a
moment here and mention our new mod mat
that I'm using right now this is an
anti-static mat we're pretty excited
about it you can find a link in the
description below for pre-orders and
it's going to help us protect the card
I'll put the ESD strap so once we get
into the card I'll switch over to the
anti-static strap just because it's
3,000 bucks so no point and killing it
over something really easy to control
like that
this backplates held on by a bunch of
tiny screws we've shown these before the
trick to these when you put them back on
is to be very gentle you do not need
much force at all tighten these back on
as soon as you face resistance stop
immediately if you keep going it will
snap the screw at the stem at the screw
head so we don't want that we've done it
before actually alright so this is the
same as all the founders edition cards
in front they were well founders
addition up front to your addition all
the founders different cards are built
this way underneath here we're gonna
have some hex heads that hold the base
plate into the the back of the card the
back of the PCB that secures those
together so here's our back plate and if
we bring the counter back over here you
can already see the back side of the PCB
is pretty dense so front sides can be
very dense I think this is a 16 phase
vrm so this is going to be a pretty
healthy size to be our rabbit I'll take
up most the board height vertically and
there's our hex heads so I need to take
those off let's secure the vapor chamber
which I'm assuming there's a vapor
chamber so let's let's get these use
these hold the base plate in if you've
ever wondered what I think about well
taking out a thousand screws it's not
only things like what thumbnail would be
successful but not over-the-top an
example of over-the-top but successful
would be something like what could go
wrong with a picture of the card and
maybe some fire some crazy facial
expressions as much as I would love to
do that for the for the views it goes
against sort of what we do here so we
will not have what could go wrong on the
thumbnail but we do have two larger
screws here as a standard on all the
founders edition does
and then three the smaller ones for the
expansion shields we can take those out
these don't really need to necessarily
come off generally I can't remember
exactly but you normally you don't have
to take all of these out it does allow
you to take the rest of the vapor
chamber out though if we end up wanting
to do that so we may do that anyway but
it's not a requirement if you're just
redoing the thermal paste or something
for example okay cool so what's holding
us on their own pads and all pads are
holding us on at this point holy crap
that is so much thermal paste so yeah
fan connector over here is what we just
disconnected we have 1 by 8 1 by 6
connectors there will only be this
version of the card there's not going to
be board partner versions so this is
everything you'll see and let's clean
off the insane amount of thermal paste
and just get an idea for what the HBM
and the dialect like together so we were
doing some thermals earlier and this
cooler is not the best in the world
we've talked about this cooler on all
the founders edition cards and this
particular GPU does not only draw a lot
of power but it's got HBM around it
drawing power and the thermal paste here
just to kind of be clear it's not bad
that there's a lot of it there's just a
lot of it because there's a lot of
surface area to cover because you've got
HBM and the GPU and hopefully we can
illustrate that once we clean it off so
like Vega this card and like the V 100
which came out first and had HBM this
card also has HP M so the V 100 was a an
enterprise solution $10,000 developer
kit that came with the first of Alta GPU
and this is a $3,000 variant the goal of
this card is not
Gaming Volta will probably go that
direction soon but it is actually things
like machine learning and so HBM is
beneficial in that space particularly
and the extra cost really doesn't matter
when you're dealing with people who have
a lot of money to do things like machine
learning because getting it done faster
of course will help pay it off whereas
just gaming you don't really don't
really care he just needed to be
affordable so you can see the four HBM
modules on there all four of them flank
the GPU proper the GPU and the HBM
modules are all on the substrate
together so they have a very short
distance to communicate which is one of
the benefits of HBM it's also got a 30
72 bit wide memory bus if memory serves
and that's another part of the reason
bandwidth on this card is pretty high
compared to what we typically see with
NVIDIA GPUs that should be clean enough
for now we don't really need to get this
stuff out of the corners and risk
scratching capacitors or things like
that but that's a so that's the Titan v
GP you the proper GPU this is a taiwan
made one is called GV 100 so that's
known - 400 that's new and it's an a.1
rev which means it's one of the first
production rev basically and the spacing
you see between the HBM is effectively
an epoxy resin that brings the surface
of the inner pose are all level up with
the HBM and the GPU so we actually can't
see the enterprise right now it's
underneath that epoxy resin it's a
protecting layer if you ate interposers
are actually very fragile if I were to
do what I'm doing right now just with my
fingernail cleaning paste out you do
that to an inner poser that's exposed
you cannot actually kill it and that
kills your GPU but this has the epoxy
resin layer that should help out a bit
and prevent any concerns on that front
so there's our GPU all shiny this is
about a truckload of throwing fit you
could do multiple
I nine CPUs with this man look at that
again that's not like it's not a bad
thing it's a lot of surface area to
cover but it's just kind of amusing
actually with with GPUs it with CPUs
there's kind of a limit on the IHS - how
much compound you can put before you're
actually making performance worse with
GPUs that's not really the case it's not
it's just exposed there's no IHS to
worry about the more pastes you get in
there like the if there's access it'll
come out of the side so it's okay so
let's get a look at the PCB we'll come
back to the cooler the PCB is gonna be a
bit of work here because there's a lot
of thermal pads and we need to kind of
be careful removing them I have spares I
can put back on in their place but
that's working surprisingly very well
actually these are kind of like a cloth
they're all pad I remove them by hand
before and they're very easy to destroy
they just kind of fray if you use your
fingernails so you need a really thin
tool to get in there and get those off
we've successfully remove that let's
just put that to the side right now that
back on there later might as well get
some of these others off oh actually is
this more of ER I'm over here this is
more of ER I'm over here so we have erm
over here and we have part of the VR I'm
over here it's pretty interesting this
is what you would it's getting pretty
close to optimal vrm design because if
you think of the Vega cards the
reference Vega boards those had that
l-shaped VR on that came like this and
that's also a very good design they get
the vrm components closer to the core it
allows for a more consistent voltage and
power throughput across the entire GPU
and it also reduces propagation delays
so this would be a continuation of that
idea of getting a more optimal vrm
layout now the reason they can do this
on both and the
and the new Nvidia test or Titan v100 or
Titan B rather with a V 100 is because
there's no G DDR so we're not
surrounding the GPU with all that stuff
we can surround with the vrm instead so
we've got that uncovered we'll look at
the of the names in a moment let's see
if we can find the voltage controller
make sure it's not on the back first
it's where you can really see that
fabric the sort of almost canvas weave
coming out of the sides of these they're
all pads these are really thin they're
woven they because they are pretty thin
you have less concern of thermal
resistivity sort of optimization issues
that you would have with thicker pads as
long as they still contact what they're
trying to contact you're good all right
it's pretty much everything so first of
all what are we leaving room for here
that's just just cutouts
that's all we're seeing here now this
sort of gloss this plate although it is
aluminum it's not gonna do a lot for you
we've got a gloss sort of vinyl coating
type thing here and that's to prevent
any electrical shorts to the plate or to
any other objects in the vicinity so
that's not helping us with thermals at
all and it's not really necessarily
meant to you get some direct contact in
these channels here but it doesn't do a
whole lot it's primarily cosmetic and
we've tested that before with
thermocouples on the backside and
everything so let's look at the vrm core
components so we have a 16 phase as
advertised it's gonna be doubled in some
capacity
we'll have build Zoid analyze the
specifics actually we've got a couple
more phases over here probably from
memory so we'll have builds way to
analyze the specifics of the vrm but
layout core layout is 16 phase and then
we've got another setup another one over
here another phase over there so let's
take a look at the cooler something I
know more about build toy's got the PCB
I'll take the cooler so cooler this is
the base
baseplate mounts directly to the PCB you
can see individual standoffs these are
raised from the aluminum base plate that
connect directly with the MOSFETs and
with other board components we have some
raised elements over here as well
connecting with various inductors and
MOSFETs and a couple of caps are
connected to this plate as well so
that's the base plate let's get this off
and take a look at the actual cooler and
the fan this these screws are for
mounting the fan so if we remove that
the fan will come loose but we can't get
at it right now anyway so might as well
wait for that what size is that 2.5 over
here so that's a 2.5 that's a 2 ok so a
2.5 minute - all right so we've gotten
that loose we need to pull these
embellishments off as well and that for
sure needs to come out okay there's your
Titan V plate nothing special it's the
same as all the others there's the
window and this looks actually a little
bit revised at least yeah this is
definitely revised actually okay so the
cooler is not 100% the same as the
previous founders Edition coolers it is
actually a little bit different are we
still screwed in somewhere or can i just
sort of work this out okay there we go
so differences from memory from the last
time these little flanges are new over
here and the bumps in here are new the
channels that are sort of chamfered
other than that some of the stuff that's
the same as previously this border over
here with the foam damper for noise
reasons and it's just a standard
aluminum thin stack you can see straight
down the center no heat pipes because it
is in fact a vapor chamber cooler which
you can kind of tell and it's
partly obvious but also well I just say
partly obvious because there's no heat
pipes
there's no density down the fins of
anything other than just air channels
and this plate here has this sort of
what you might think as a mini copper
heat pipe so that's an indicator of
vapor chamber so that's our cooling
block it is a little revised from
previously but not a whole lot and other
than that you're left with this which is
the blower fan standard radial fan and I
guess we could get the ratings on that
if we wanted to take that apart too but
that would require removing all this
stuff and it's going to be the same as
all the previous fans from Nvidia so so
that's basically the Titan V there's not
much left to take apart here so I think
what we are left with at this point is a
PCB that needs analysis so this will be
looked at by build Zoid on our channel
you can subscribe to make sure you catch
that content when it goes up bill joy is
gonna be doing a full analysis of the
vrm and its capabilities he has quite a
few curiosities about the power
potential limitations on this board and
GPU or at least on the GPU and we've got
some notes on that as well so make sure
you check back our game benchmarks will
be up first after the game benchmarks we
intend to be posting some production
level benchmarks thermals power noise
all that stuff so that's all for this
