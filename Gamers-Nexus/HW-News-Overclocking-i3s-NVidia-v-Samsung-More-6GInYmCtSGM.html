dotnet and we are here to recap last
week's hardware news we're starting off
with an asrock and msi bios update which
allows some Z 170 boards to overclock
intel i3 cpus and if you know anything
about the sky lake i3 skews none of them
have AK identifiers and that is intel's
way of saying it is unlocked for
overclocking so the i3 is not natively
an overclocking chip it is not natively
and officially supported with the MSI
and asrock BIOS updates you can sort of
patch the firmware on existing boards
including the x power gaming te the
gaming m9 gaming m7 and m5 and g 45 from
msi and a number of the x the extreme
series boards from asrock the extreme
seven and so on and you can unlock those
to allow overclocking of Intel i3 cpus
the sky li quans there's no guarantee
that this will continue to work going
forward or if they'll be blocked or not
but it works for now so if you do have
one of those e170 boards from asrock or
msi you have an i3 cpu it may be worth
investigating and seeing if you can
actually overclock them or not and how
far you can get the next news item
pertains to the Samsung and NVIDIA
patent lawsuits that upon going from
both companies so they've taken turns
exchanging blows with one another over
various patents and other issues and
this sort of retaliatory lawsuit that
nvidia filed recently alleges that
samson is infringing on Nvidia's patents
in their mobile devices and they have
bundled qualcomm into that sort of mess
of company suing each other so qualcomm
is a mobile device manufacturer they
make chips for CPUs and GPUs for phones
and Samsung is obviously a phone and
tablet and manufacturer of many things
so and video was suing them Samsung over
this patent allegation the original
ruling overturned this suit nvidia
appealed it went to a higher judge they
overturned it and said not only was it
over
the first time but the patent one of the
patents was invalidated this particular
one but another nvidia patent wasn't
validated in the process so a bit of
attrition I guess you could say in that
process and now nvidia is appealing
again it will go to another court at
some point in the future and we'll see
if it actually goes anywhere or if it
just sits in the court system forever so
no concern for samson right now
basically as it stands the next news
item is a pretty big one this is about
micron micron is a manufacturer of flash
nand for ssds so a lot of the big player
manufacturers and SSD brands will source
some of their supply from micron and
intel is included in this Intel actually
owns micron and their flash supply comes
from micron so that's used in a lot of
the intel ssds including the PCIe new
SSDs so micron is buying a company
called in Otara and that is for 3.2
billion dollars which buys out the
remaining sixty-seven percent stake in
this company and this is a partnership
micron has had with in Otara for about
seven years now they've decided to
officially by the company and now we'll
be able to purchase their DRAM at cost
and yet better access to some of the
memory devices that micron does not
already make in the house so that gives
a micron direct access the DRAM it
should help lower their bill of
materials or bo em and that will feed
into the SSD manufacturers as well
hopefully like intel and may cause some
price drops next news item is and these
four gigabyte card so the r9 390 is an
eight gigabyte video card and that is
that's available everywhere in China as
of recently the last week or so the r9
390 began shipping for with 4 gigabytes
for slightly cheaper price so that
hasn't come to the US yet if it does
would expect a lower price because the
vram is cheaper if you have less of it
so that is something to look out for it
something I really get excited about
because the 390 is already fairly cheap
300 300 otters maybe
and with 4 gigabytes unless it drops a
substantial amount from the cost which I
don't think it will it's it's not too
worth getting hyped about but it is
certainly a newsworthy item that there
will be a 4 gigabyte 390 model out there
now the last item for the week for last
week's roundup is the HTC vive so this
is a device that we've talked about a
few times on the channel and on the
website and great depth actually talking
about the engineering and how the vive
works and the vibe just a quick recap is
a virtual reality solution it is
basically designed and engineered by
valve and the HTC is using their
production facilities to to manufacture
it and ship it more quickly so it is the
HTC vive or the valve I've or steam VR
whatever you want to call it that uses
lighthouses which go in the corners of
the room and those use IR and laser
scanning the track your position the
some diodes that are on the headset so
the diodes receive the light and
transmit your location of the room so
that is the HTC vive and the news item
is that its consumer release has been
pushed back to april twenty sixteen but
pre-orders will open in February so
that's just after CES speaking of CES we
will be there as always and HTC vive
will have their development kit
available on site for preview and we're
hoping to get a look at that and of
course we'll let you all know if that
happens so that's it for last week's
news recapped we're going to take a bit
slower this week for obvious holiday
reasons but we do have some major
content coming up through the next
couple of days as always and then CES is
after that so big stuff coming from
there for sure that's all for this time
