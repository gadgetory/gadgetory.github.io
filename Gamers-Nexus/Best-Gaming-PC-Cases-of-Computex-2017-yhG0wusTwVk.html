this year like the wheel of star mod at
: masters booth
the massive Corsair concept slate
enclosure that used to lean costing
nearly three-quarters of a million
dollars and the throne will take level
20 monolith of aluminum and glass but we
also had a chance to cover more consumer
targeted cases and today we're looking
at the best ATX cases at the show
including Leon the Silverstone EVGA
cooler master thermaltake and be quiet
in the front-runner group there's also a
bonus entry in the micro STX category as
well before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by Corsairs
new at t1 race chair which is a $350
gaming targetted chair using a bucket
style race seat the chair arms have four
directional movement for configuration
to your liking and has a bonus they use
rollerblade wheels
learn more at the link in the
description below this case roundup
won't include every single thing we saw
at the show and will exclude some of the
more exotic cases like the concept slate
the in win-win bot for example the
floating and the Thermaltake level 20
but there's still plenty to get through
the article below contain an updated
table with each case and links to
further information on everything here
if you want more depth we're starting
with Leon Lee is a new alpha series of
cases as the company makes another
attempt to enter the mass consumer
market rather than use aluminum and lots
of glass in the Alpha 330 and 350 cases
Leon Lee is instead using steel to help
lower price and bring it to mass market
this means that shipping lower end alpha
330s will not include any fans with them
as Lee only wants you to buy your own to
again help lower price the Alpha 330
targets a $100 price point and using the
same tool and as the 350 internally just
with a difference in top and front panel
height where the 350 is running a taller
build with front IO and additional
buttons for LEDs we think of 330 is the
most interesting here given its lower
price and could make for one of Li only
the best ventures in the consumer market
last far we're not sure how airflow will
pan out with the glass panel front but
the company might still make some
changes like slits on the side panel or
the side of the front panel for better
breathing but we'll look at all that in
due time for now the Alpha 330 is one of
the best cases to watch from Leon Lee in
both cases come in both black and white
ishes silverstone had three new ATX
cases on display that will talk about
the rv0 for in a moment for non ATX case
the PS 15 is Silverstone's most
noteworthy case from the show we think
everything is still subject to change
here including case tooling but most of
the cases use some sort of familiar
Silverstone cooling from me the red
liner could buy cases of the past we saw
bits and pieces of the previous Qi and
redline case in the newcomers and the PS
50 makes the best mixture of function
focused cooling ventilation and some of
the front panel looks that Silverstone
is trying to adopt given the current
market trend the RL 0-6 recently chart
topped in our benchmarks with
significantly better cooling than all of
its competition that we've tested
something afforded by the cases that
mesh front intake and focus on removing
solid panel restrictions to airflow and
while the PS 15 takes parts of this
approach they also try to account for
that current trend of covering up the
front with something solid so they do
that with a somewhat mesh and ventilated
front panel that's a bit denser in the
steel parts of the mesh also keeping
with trends the PS 15 uses a tinted
tempered glass side panel with a
minimalistic approach to drive support
another major trend lately the case is
more of a mid tower like all three cases
that we're looking at from Silverstone
right now the PS 15 will be priced at
$60 the other cases at the show where
the $70 are l08 those Silverstone might
rename it to the cupola family and the
80 to $90 redline o 7 which features a
geometric split down the center whereas
the RL 0 8 uses more of an s-shaped
curve with red lighting neither of these
two cases have a focus on cooling and
are clearly trying to stick with trends
of blocked front ventilation for this
reason we think the PS 15 is the most
interesting of the lot right now as for
the honorable mention from silverstone
the new raven r VZ 0 4 is the smallest
possible form factor that can still
support a gaming machine it's able to
achieve this by using a micro STX
motherboard which are available rarely
but primarily from asrock along with an
MSM video card here's the problem though
this case and its platform hinges on
users being vocal about one in it
the r VZ is 0 for can fit an MX m gtx
1070 and a micro SD x motherboard of the
high NCP
but that won't matter until AMD and
NVIDIA make em X em cards available
through retail channels right now you
can only get them really in sort of a
gray market meaning that they're
expensive as well we think Nvidia and
AMD might be hesitant to make em XM
cards available because they don't want
users keeping old laptops alive or not
really sure if there's a legitimate
reason otherwise if mxm ends up on
retail channels the RV's e04 and its
micro-st x platform could permit one of
these smallest gaming PC builds possible
silverstone is even making custom MXM
GPU coolers to accommodate the platform
Coolermaster is making a big return to
cases this year primarily there are
older case lines the cosmos is they
return to the big cases of your though
it's still useful for a shrinking market
of data enthusiasts or large at
workstation users the cosmos C 700p
leverages its size to permit an
invertible motherboard tray similar to
the be quiet dark bass pro 900 the
motherboard tray can be completely
removed from the system the system can
then be installed and it can be placed
back in the case facing either left or
right depending on preference the side
panels are also sigh diagnostic making
it easy to completely rotate case layout
if desirable and this follows cooler
masters new modular focus aside from
this the C 700 P can outfit 8 drives in
the front something we haven't heard
much in the last few years and has
additional space on the front of the
power supply shroud for a primary SSD
mount the front of the case folds out
for access to a dust filter which also
folds out and the 140 millimeter fans
sits behind this another large dust
filter covers the bottom of the case
where the C 700 P is higher legs elevate
to the enclosure for cool air intake and
a radiator cage is present under the PSU
shroud for this region of the case given
it exposure to outside air through the
underside of the enclosure there is
support for 3 140 milliliter fans in the
front of the case 1 140 millimeter in
the rear and then a couple of the top as
well and stock the case comes with 2 140
milliliter front fans in the bottom two
sections of the installation area and
one 140 millimeter rear fan none of
these have LEDs just a bit different
from the H 500 P that we'll be talking
about later this is a true workstation
enclosure for now coolermaster is
expecting pricing to be in the 300 to
350 dollar range partially because of
the 4
to fake tempered-glass side panel with
tapered sides and its hinge and release
is sometime in October if you're
building a machine that's going to be
working with a lot of data and as more
of a workstation focus this is a good
case to look at and in that similar
market this next one is quick since it's
based on a case that we covered last
year be quiet has refreshed it's dark
based Pro 900 line with a new white
edition which will ship in a limited
quantity of 2,000 units at first but the
white looks good on this case white is
notoriously difficult to get right when
mixing materials so be quiet spent most
of its time ramping up this case
manufacturing with tone matching the
plastics and the metals of the case and
was able to get the white to match on
all the panels we can't say that for all
the cases we've reviewed in the past
that are white though the case should
run about ten dollars more than the
standard DB pro 900 making it around 260
dollars and will otherwise be identical
each case will include a nameplate with
the case number of the production run
availability will start in late quarter
three early quarter four and be quiet
might add on more to the production run
if it's in high demand and we're hoping
to review this one once it comes out
though the core features are the same as
the previous black version which
includes an invertible motherboard tray
just like the C 700p with some more
unique customizable and modular features
that be quite advertised at last year's
show for something more affordable EVGA
zg7 series of cases will finally hit
production after a long delay we first
saw the D g7 at CES this year but the
case has now been finalized into a
series of D g7 cases including the G G
73 75 76 and 77 the only number they
skipped is the 74 all three cases carry
the same tooling with the difference
primarily being cosmetic to where the
tempered glass plates are the DG 73 will
be more budget focused and should be
priced roughly around $60 EVGA the G 73
will include a single stock fan will
have only one tempered glass panel on
the front and will use an acrylic side
window on the left side this is a bit
different from most cases that use
tempered glass for one side since they
tend to put it on the left so that sets
the D g7 apart in some ways the higher
end of the spectrum the 77 and 76 are
differentiated from each other primarily
by the presence of a K boost button and
an extra fan on the DG 77 the cables
button if you're not familiar basically
just maxes out the
the CPU in their highest P States at all
times so if you wanted to run your max
clocks for some reason you can do that
with the KBS button without needing
software so 77 should be priced under
$150 and will include three tempered
glass panels on the front and on both
sides looking now at thermal takes view
21 and cord g21 these cases also targets
the more affordable price point at
around 70 dollars and they will do so
with two different phase plates the view
21 uses an acrylic panel in the front
with a rounded front end on the left
side wrapping around the case and
allowing intake on the right side the
g21 meanwhile sticks with the mesh front
the mesh is a bit dense and not as
breathable as again the are l06 for
example but still breathes a whole lot
more air than most the cases on the
market today both cases have a tempered
glass left side panel continuing the
trend of cases in the 60 70 dollar range
with tempered glass paneling which seems
to be a big theme this year and details
are TVD on how many fans are included a
lot of these cases are still prototypes
or early versions Thermaltake also had
new cases in the 7 &amp;amp; 9 TVs like the view
91 TG which has suicide doors on each
side vertical GPU mount and some tooling
from the W 100 just with a new back
panel for the GPU mouthing and a
different paneling on the outside of the
case and next we're moving on to the
case that takes our highest award for
the best case at Computex 2017 and
that's the cooler master H 500 P the H
500 P has the most excited for
benchmarking and analysis because it is
a revisit to the companies that
critically acclaimed half-line we
actually used the half ex heavily in one
of our earliest test benches the half
series hasn't aged well though it
features old hat design cues with a dust
heavy approach to the exterior and the H
500 P aims to resurrect the half brand
but does so while borrowing modern
design tropes to limit dust and noise
while still hanging on to its signature
200 millimeter fans and high airflow
focus this includes it - 200 millimeter
fans on the front with RGB LEDs included
in the case stock and then it's also got
room for 200 in the top or you can go
with 140 s on the top part of the top
section so it's 2 top sections one on
the inside of the case one of the top of
the case the one on the inside allows
for 3 120 millimeter fans the one on the
top allows for 3 141
and we have a full video talking about
the rest of details of this case
including the price and the release date
and finally we have the needs work
category for some cases at the show that
are still in prototype staging and have
time to make changes that people have
talked about online but we think aren't
quite there yet the BitFenix and so
lands on this list first it's another
case targeting the 60 to 70 dollar range
with tempered glass while keeping some
RGB on it but it presently has
absolutely no front intake this case
will heat up like a hot box and has no
means to get cool air in but after
talking about Phoenix it sounds like the
company is considering adding some mesh
or ventilated front intake along with
its included RGB LED strip this is a
scenario where we see it looks taking
priority over engineering but it's still
possible for the two to co-exist and
it's important that BitFenix realizes
this and fixes some sort of intake
before release in the case it does have
a lot of potential though particularly
in these 60 to 70 dollar markets and
another case and the needs work category
is the in when 806 though we do think
it's getting there quickly
the 806 shows in one's unique idea to
add wood to a case making very sort of
modern type design for a home this looks
best on the gaming a1 cube which could
find its place in the living room of a
Frank Lloyd Wright house for example but
it still looks ok on the 806 we're told
that the 806 will use Sun wood which is
effectively a plywood with the other two
cases using it maple and Cypress the Sun
wood panel looks ok but with a target of
$250 we're hoping anyone does more to
improve something else in the case maybe
cooling for example so that is better on
this halo case in the previous halo case
which was the infinity so far it looks
like they're on the right track there's
about an inch of intake on the sides of
the front and top of that wood panel
which anyone specifically pointed out to
us given our criticism of the infinity
so that shows that they've really taken
note of the cooling limitations of
previous designs a bit more work to be
done yet but it's well on its way to
being a unique case that's still
functional and that's it for this case
roundup we have plenty of individual
case coverage from the show at each of
the booths there are some more halo type
products or just interesting ones in
general like we in wind wind bot be in
win the floating case and then Thurman
will take level 28 Corsairs slate con
case which may not even make it to
market though probably will in some form
by the end of the year so check all that
