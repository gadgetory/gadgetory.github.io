uses the same internal tool and as the
spec oh one from a few years back
borrows from the newer respect alpha but
lowers the price point to $50 and
reduces fan count to one one twenty
millimeter intake pre-installed fan for
lightweight box at fifty dollars it
seems suitable for ultra budget PC build
but we'll soon find out how it performs
thermally acoustically and how the
quality holds up to a real build before
getting to that this content is brought
to you by v1 tech comm who make the
custom backplate shown in our b-roll on
the screen of the MSI gaming X they've
also got plenty of on the back plates
you can go to their website and use code
gamers Nexus 5 for $5 off click the link
of the description below for more
information we've got a lot of testing
for this case in this one including some
frequency versus time plots we don't
normally need with cases but we'll show
you why in a bit and then we also have
some tests but what happens if you add a
fan in the front or in the back slot but
going over the basics first before
getting into the testing it's a $50
enclosure that means that obviously you
can't be too picky about the different
small things on the case that you might
gain a larger more expensive case for
but with this one what you're looking at
is a budget target build the tooling is
the same internally as a speck of one if
you know the spec of one you pretty much
know what this looks like internally the
spec alpha is not too different it's a
bit different in the visual Department
exterior wise but internally not too
many changes for this case there's a
drive cage in the bottom front it is
separable you can remove it and if you
do that you could add another front
impact pen at the bottom potentially
helping with GPU cooling there's a front
intake fan option in the top but the
included intake fan is a 120 millimeter
with an off white off blue white LED
dead centre that splits there between
the CV and the GP we'll test that in a
bit the top there are two mounting
options but the clearance on the top is
not that great as you've noticed this is
a pretty small case and being a small
case that means that your movement and
your ability to fit different things up
there is going to be limited based on
the CPU cooler you choose and other
things like that there's also a rear
exhaust option if you wanted to install
a fan on the back and then for the rest
of the case we're looking at limited
side panel cable management but enough
to get you by with a budget build
and bottom oriented PS you know PSU
Shroud whatsoever which helps save on
cost not everything needs a shroud
anyway in terms of the dimensions this
case is 492 by 201 by 433 millimeters it
weighs four point two kilograms empty so
it's pretty damn light and it's a small
box the front panel IO has one USB 3.0
ports and one USB 2.0 ports rather than
from million two USB 3 into one cable
which is what you normally find they've
gone with one and one USB 3 and USB 2 so
not not a favorite there but really not
that big of a deal the spec alpha has 2
USB 3 if you preferred it and is
currently available around 60-63 dollars
not that much more expensive
other than that cable management isn't
bad it's really nothing to write home
about
it's not dismal you can hide stuff in
the back there are cable tie points in
the back so you can hide stuff and tie
it down but it's not necessarily going
to be the prettiest without a lot of
work so you'll have to put some time in
managing cables interior is pretty
straightforward build process nothing is
special here nothing is different from
normal PC building the back the rear i/o
and the expansion covers have the offset
screws in the back of the case rather
than inside the case which personally I
prefer that's more of a subjective
preference thing but I do prefer when
they've exposed the screws for the
expansion devices like the video card
through the outside because then you can
get at the screw without cross threading
so that's always a nice thing to see and
it's just it's a small thing but other
than that is the standard case will just
roll straight into the testing for
testing methodology as always check the
article links in the description below
where we've also got Patrick Layton's
written review of this case he's one who
worked with the build for the most part
and then for testing we've got a few new
things here so first of all we've been
slowly rolling out some new thermal
tests for these and that includes a
blender pass on the CPU and a blender
pass on the GPU that gives you a
real-world scenario to look at rather
than just stress testing and we've also
added a 3d mark pass which sort of
simulates gaming because it's load on
both the GPU and the CPU but it's not as
torturous as the power virus workload
that we run for our torture scenario to
see where the the maximum potential is
for all these cases in term
of thermals so that's been added we have
the normal noise testing and we've also
up front got some extra fans we
positioned an extra fan in the front top
up here which helps with CPU airflow for
the most part we also position one in
the back they're both 120 millimeter
fans we did not do more than one fan for
the extra fan testing because honestly
if you're spending $50 on a case and
then $8 on a fan you add a second fan
you're basically spending 20 more
dollars you might as well just buy a
better case so there's no real point in
testing that from our standpoint even
may as well look at something like a 270
our windowed version for 70 bucks save
yourself the trouble and get something
that's better out of box altogether
anyway so we tell us with one extra fan
top front and back and then the stock
configuration let's start with the extra
fan testing and is a competitive testing
against other cases starting with the
CPU torture test temperatures for extra
fans that we see that adding a fan to
the front grants and immediate performs
up with about 10,000 reducing
temperatures to 57.8 tell these delta t
/ ambient this helps dramatically in CPU
temperatures and brings us down under
throttling territory unfortunately the
fan is partially obstructed by the front
panel so its ability to improve thermals
is limited by this and for that reason
the rear exhaust configuration also
helps about the same amount marginally
more just outside of our test resolution
and can be explained by ridding of
radiative heat off the GPU backplate in
addition to being less obstructed as the
front fan is either way adding one fans
the case helps tremendously and would be
worthwhile as an investment for 8 bucks
10 bucks but no more than that here's a
look at TV frequency versus time with
these configurations with the stock
configuration we can see clear
throttling as the CPU enters 90 to 100 C
range of our torture workload keep in
mind that this will vary heavily based
on the CPU cooler you've selected and
also will depend on the type of workload
you're putting the CPU through we're
using a torture scenario here so it gets
a bit better after this this is one of
the worst cases adding a fan in either
configuration removes the throttle event
and smooth things out for the CPU
overall looking at GPU temperatures
after adding an extra fan we see a
reduction from sixty-four Celsius LT
over ambient which is roughly the
throttle points after you factor in
ambient to around sixty point five
celsius delta T with an extra rear fan
or around 60,000 with an extra front fan
performance between these two is then
significantly
friends meaning that they are within
peasant has variance and resolution and
accuracy of our testing the two are
effectively the same for GP performance
and we can't really claim with
definitive advantage between the front
and rear mount options especially given
that case testing vary so much based on
configuration what we can say is that
adding a fan is definitely worthwhile
especially being get one for less than
ten bucks so that the case doesn't
really exceed the sixty dollar mark
3dmark is one of our new introductions
to case testing we're using a looping
fire strike extreme test for in half an
hour here producing a load on both the
CPU and GPU but unless torturous of a
manner than the one done in the extreme
burnin that was just shown previously
this more closely resembles gaming
workloads for extended periods of time
and as the tests are new we are still
adding to the charts and only have two
devices presently plotted the corsair
stack of four runs with CPU temperature
thirty eight point nine Celsius Delta Z
over ambient to the 3d mark burnin which
is about nine Celsius higher than our
open-air Corp III configuration
effectively the resting state of where
you'd be testing without an enclosure
the GPU temperatures run about five
Celsius higher with a delta T of fifty
nine up four Celsius on the Corsair
configuration to get a better idea of
how this looks in reality let's look at
a frequency versus temperature chart
like we do in our GPU reviews in this
chart we can see how a GPU frequency
response to rising temperatures our fan
is fixed in 55 percent rpm which is
around where the GPU fans tend to
configure their maximum profile before
sacrificing frequency rather than noise
but the times I want you by of course
technically you could run a higher DP
fan speed and solve for this frequency
throttling problem but you'd be
drastically increasing noise something
to the effect of T times perceived noise
increase depending on what video card is
to use if you start watching the 80 to
90 percent fan speed territory
regardless there's a clear downtrend in
core frequency until a point where it
fluctuates between the high 1700 to 1800
results in 784 cells his maximum
desirable GP core temperature the V bios
begins throttling back performance to
sustain this temperature target under
stock configurations which means losing
frame rate due to heat and again this
isn't a torturer workload it's just 3d
mark moving on from the torture workload
and from 3d mark we can list a blender
next which are real use cases for 3d
animators everywhere with CPU rendering
enabled we see the Corsair spec code for
with a single famishing the CPU to 43.5
celsius LT over an inch with our cooler
about 6.1 qaulity is warmer than an open
Thermaltake core p3 configuration which
runs a load cpu DT of about 37.3 Celsius
idle temperatures are also a few degrees
higher on the GPU which isn't doing work
in this scenario but is still humming
along in the box
moving the blender GPU rendering we've
only got two case on this chart as it's
still new but it's a good first look the
corsair spec code for with its single
fan at 1300 rpm runs the CPU DT of about
35 cells he's over ambient with the GPU
load L temperature at 37.6 Celsius over
ambient the silverstone are l06 at 1,000
rpm with its three 120 millimeter front
fan and one 120 millimeter rear fan
configuration is able to sustain a 20 T
Salty's delta T CPU temperature and 24.7
Celsius delta theory' m8 GPU temperature
and for an extra 15 dollars that's a
significant reduction in thermal so
they're almost matter to you you're
going to be running 100% workloads on
one or two of your opponents at any
given time it's worth considering the
upgrade finally for torture workload
tests check our article in the
description below for more information
on this but we can briefly go over them
this chart shows the CPU temperature
under our GPU and CPU torture scenario
placing the corsair spec of four toward
the bottom of this chart for the cpu
load and idle temperatures running 868
celsius Delta G over ambient value the
GBA tortured temperatures are also among
the worst pushing us up against the 84
Celsius threshold for this card before
we start throttling on the clock this is
the same tortures workload that we used
for the initial extra fans test and
again case testing is the least
scientific testing of all four
components just because there are so
many configuration options even between
blower fans and dual axial fans or just
the component power draws the CP and the
GPU but from this we can still garner a
baseline performance based on where we
fall with the other cases that we've
tested on our bench and the torch our
codes kind of give the biggest look at
that but we're expanding the 3dmark
workloads as well what we learn here is
that maybe if you had a GPU like a 10 to
the or 1050 Ti
you would be okay in this case it still
certainly be warm depending on how good
that GPU cooler is but you'd have more
Headroom to work with than a higher-end
device that said if you're planning to
run your CPU at 100% we're cool
or high percentage utilization at any
given time for example you're doing
blender rendering any kind of
benchmarking or if you're just running
applications that are very CPU intensive
like Excel when it's crunching all the
formulas then you might want to consider
adding that extra fan to the front top
because again a 10 Celsius decrease with
this configuration which is not an
abnormal one that we tested for someone
buying a case like this it's a
worthwhile investment and when I said
not an abnormal one you might not buy a
GTX 1084 the case of course but for the
cooler you're probably going to have a
tower cool or not dissimilar from the
one we used which is about a $30 tower
cooler if you bought a hyper 212 it
would be the same sort of configuration
in terms of how the air flow works stock
coolers a bit different but stuff colors
can be worse anyway so if you're running
a stock cooler that further solidifies
that you should get the front fan extra
for a couple bucks and call it a day
but there's a reason we look at
temperatures beyond just the thermal
reasons we also look because noise so
even if you're going to be running a GPU
temperature of 60 to 70 Celsius for a
lower-end card it doesn't mean you have
to run the higher noise output to
sustain that temperature if you have a
better case so what I'm saying is if you
get something like a better case maybe
the are l06
you can get away with running slower
internal fan RPMs on the CPU cooler and
especially the GPU cooler and therefore
a lower noise output provided the fans
in the front of the case are obviously
within a reasonable noise output as well
so you've got more noise variance and
reigns there that you can control for if
you have a better case and a better
baseline cooling to begin with if you
don't care about noise and you don't
have to care about temperatures then
disregard all that by what looks best
the corsair spec for by a nature of
running a single fan is able to get away
with a lower noise output though than
some of its neighbors so let's look at
the noise chart the case doesn't make
any attempts to contain noise especially
with that front mesh intake but it also
doesn't emit much given system
components that are reasonably inaudible
we measure about 36.7 DBA output with
the spec oh for placing it effectively
equal with the 270 our 1300 rpm which
has two fans and Silverstone's our l06
at 1,000 rpm Silverstone our l06 today
with a cool significantly
even at this reduced 1,000 rpm number
and those so while retaining its similar
noise output that said it's also an
extra $15 so it just comes down to a
cost argument and how much the noise and
thermal is matter to the user this is a
fine case for $50 it's certainly warm
warmer than the other ones we've tested
but those tend to be better for thermals
they're more expensive they come with
more fans or just better sort of airflow
path design if you can call that whereas
this one's got half the front panel
blocked off so you lose some performance
there because of that but it's an okay
case if you're building a $50 ultra
budget machine something like a g4 560
with maybe a 1030 or a 1050 TI it's a
good pairing what you might want to
consider again at $8 so it's really a
$58 case by a fan with it that's
certainly worth it and if it's within
range consider some alternatives the
alternatives of note would be Corsair
zone 270 R which is a case that we liked
quite a bit when it came out it's got
two fans for the windowed version the
design is good enough that you're going
to get better cooling overall and of
course doesn't all come down to fans it
has a pretty good noise control as well
because the front panel is largely
blocked off but it's got there's wide
side intakes on the front another option
if you still want Corsair the spec Alfa
currently is about 63 dollars that's a
rebate which brings it pretty close to
this one and it's got a similar
aesthetic that's really why you're
looking at this case and finally the
Silverstone R l06 at 75 dollars is a
really good buy if you care about
thermals and not much else which
depending on what you're building and
who you are and how you're using your
system if you're going to run CPU or GPU
at 100% when doing renders and things
like that it's a worthwhile investment
to just go that extra $15 get something
that'll keep it cool while still being
portable compared to some of the more
expensive cases so those ones to look at
this one is okay it's not offensive in
any capacity just add a fan stock it's
probably not the best thing you could
buy but once you add a fan it is a good
purchase so that is all for this one as
always you go to patreon.com/scishow and
