Nexus dotnet and today we're looking at
Skyrim again it's been quite a while
we've published several graphics mod
overhauls and general game overhauls in
the past few years I think our most
recent was 2012 or 2013 so it's been a
while Skyrim of course came out in 2011
and what we're doing here today is
updating the graphics so that it looks a
little bit more modern but we're trying
to do this with two key elements in mind
one is we would like to retain the
original aesthetic of the game a lot of
mod overhauls to sort of throw that out
the window and two we're looking to do
this graphics update without nuking
performance and this is pretty critical
because it's very easy to go overboard
with Skyrim modding and just sort of
destroy your performance we're doing
this in a few ways one of them is by
avoiding 4k textures we're opting
instead for 2k textures and this will
also help avoid mod conflicts where
optimization is done on most mods for 2k
textures so this helps prevent
flickering tearing and anomalies where
you have textures that are lower
resolution than everything around them
so that's that's one thing and then
we're also just sticking more heavily to
color correction and lighting effects
because a huge amount can be
accomplished by using these two features
with things like bloom depth of field
and color correction and then we'll sort
of pad the rest of it with textures and
texture resolution mods the full list of
mods can be found on the website and
you'll need to go there to find the
links for them and the order of
installation installation does matter in
this case and we strongly recommend
using mod organizer it's effectively
required at this point it's a free
program you can download the mod
straight into it from the Skyrim mod
Nexus and then sort them accordingly
based on conflicts and things like that
we've done the hard work for you the
correct installation order is listed on
the website in the order of appearance
in the article so we're starting with
essentials here once you have the Skyrim
script extender skse that enables a lot
of other mods to do what they do and
things like sky UI which is very
strongly encouraged but not as is really
required you can move on to other
essential
like climates of Tamriel which helps
bring weather and lighting overhauls
into Skyrim it has optional sound
add-ons for better ambience and the mod
is highly customizable it uses an
installation menu that can be changed
directly through Skyrim you don't have
to do it thread and organize or anything
like that and you can throw in a few
dungeon lighting mods and things like
that to tweak the game to your liking
we recommend avoiding the cold and warm
options for this as color correction
we'll be covering this through the
imaginator which is a very good mod that
I'll be talking about momentarily and
this is all basically ESP files I can
very easily be activated and deactivated
next is the Skyrim flora overhaul and
we're just covering the key mods here
and you can see the rest in the article
but key mods we've got climates of
Tamriel Skyrim flora overhaul and this
very drastically increases the quality
of the plant life and the foliage and
things like that all around Skyrim
without necessarily destroying your
performance adding things like grass
foliage and plant life is very
performance intensive but the way Skyrim
flora overhaul implements it it really
doesn't show up too much for really any
modern video cards and this is something
we'll look at later in the quick
benchmarks that I performed we're
skipping a few mods here in the list and
jumping down to enhanced lights and
effects this is a pretty important mod
e.l.f ex pumps up the values of all the
light sources in the game and it moves
and removes some of them so if there are
light sources that are maybe a little
bit too violent or too overexposing with
the new settings the mod will move those
and remove some of that negative side
effect of the exposure imaginator is a
key item to talk about you'll see some
of the settings being applied through
imaginator in this footage imaginator is
something that installs straight to the
mod configuration menu in Skyrim in the
game and you can tune color correction
to your own liking it's very easy to do
you just slide sliders around save exit
the menu and see how it looks and then
you go from there you can also
use the depth of field modifications in
the same menu system which we'll get to
through Dynavision momentarily
imaginator though one of the key mods
that we highly recommend once you've got
these installed it's time to look at
textures and for really most users on
our channel I would imagine you probably
have hardware that is of the grade of a
gtx 750ti or better in that case you can
install all this stuff and expect above
60fps performance at 1080p for sure
anything lower than that 250 X it starts
struggling but 750 Ti and better you can
install these mods to Skyrim HD is a
blanket texture mod this basically
overhauls all the textures in the game
but it just mostly helps cover gaps
because what we're gonna do is install
this first and then we install the other
texture mods on top of it and that will
force the mod organizer to defer to the
higher level mods that are installed on
top of it and then fallback only on
Skyrim HD when the other better mods are
not available for a certain texture in
the game so if we have special road
textures which we will then the Skyrim
HD roads will be overwritten by the
immersive roads textures so that's where
we start Skyrim HD can be thought of as
a bedrock make sure you download the
full versions of all these towns
dungeons landscape and miscellaneous
then there's improved NPC clothing just
very simply at overhauls the clothing of
Barkeeper's guards things like that to
be a higher resolution we also recommend
installing several of the a Midian
Bourne textures and gamma CH textures
which are all very fine-tuned for
different items so gommage will focus on
clutter and things like that
Midian Bourne will focus on weapons and
armor and that will sort of cover your
items in the game and objects and then
once these are all installed it's
important to use the static mesh
improvement mod this one's been around
forever and a lot of people are pretty
familiar with it at this point the
modification takes all the statics in
the world that were low poly and low
resolution and upgrades them so this is
necessary for some replacers to function
well like the
Clawd textures and it primarily works by
just fixing the poly count and smoothing
objects out around the edges you can see
the testing methodology in the article
it's in-depth enough to get accurate
results for Skyrim but it's certainly
not anywhere near as in-depth as our
video card reviews because it doesn't
have to be with Skyrim a very important
note is that the game is forced to
vertical sync and this actually proves
to be pretty important we disable it for
testing so that we can determine the
absolute performance of each card in a
vacuum and see which one's better
against the next but when you're playing
the game you'll probably want to enable
vsync or at least cap the FPS to
something like 85 really at a max
because Skyrim has some physics issues
when the frame rate exceeds those it is
tied to the frame rate for its physics
effects so for 4k really the performance
is pretty surprising this is the best
performing 4k game I've ever tested but
that's because I've been testing 4k as
far back as 2011 when this came out so
you see even though 285 is almost able
to handle it at average FPS but the 0.1%
low is a little bit too low for
playability so we have to jump up a bit
we jump up to the GTX 980 and there are
nine 290x are fairly playable r9 290x
struggles a bit with the 0.1% and 1%
lows but it's really not that bad moving
into 1440 you see that we're starting to
hit the bottleneck that will be more
revealed at 1080 the bottleneck is 112
fps that's either my guess would be a
software layer thing that could also be
an API thing or it may be a CPU but I
really sincerely doubt that I feel like
the bottleneck is more software or API
bound for Skyrim you can see here every
card handles the game just fine at 1440
the exceptions being the very low end
the 962 gigabytes struggles a bit with
0.1% low you can actually see quite a
gap between the 0.1% lows with two gig
and four gigabyte GTX 960 s and this
feeds into the Skyrim massive vram
modded discussion that's had commonly
and then the gtx 750ti
struggles a bit with point
some lows to the point that it's really
starting to look better to downgrade to
1080p so let's do that
going down to 1080p we see the benchmark
is throttling again at 112 fps across
the board really for almost everything
and that is probably software API is
something like that but you're gonna be
playing at 60fps on average anyway
because of the way the game locks the
framerate in the physics so anything
about 60 is good here what we're looking
at more is the point one percent lows
and really at this point everything is
very playable the only downside is the
250x which is a pretty cheap card and
only gigabyte of VRAM so nothing to
complain about here in the 750ti for
$148 card does very well with these mods
installed so this is the benchmark with
all the mods installed well they can
have very high performance for pretty
much any modern video card and I would
say just go ahead and play install these
things for any modern rig and you'll be
just fine you may run it to some two
gigabyte four gigabyte issues at the
point one percent lows but this testing
was performed in a very geometrically
complex alleyway in solitude the city so
this is sort of a worst case scenario
for the benchmark and for the most part
you'll be seeing better performance
depending on where you are in the game
so that's all for the mod overhaul check

mods and for help installing an
installation order things like that if

that you get some value out of the
