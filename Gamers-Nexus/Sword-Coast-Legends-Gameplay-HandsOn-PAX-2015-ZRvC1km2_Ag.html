dotnet and i'm joined by tim welke the
design director on Sword Coast legends
at n space and sword coast legends we
looked at previously with Dan touch and
we talked about the DM mode the campaign
mode and today we're looking at the game
as it approaches launch so launch is sep
tember September 29th on pc mac and
linux and the game is it's sort of an
RPG that is based in the older baldur's
gate style play but i guess the most
interesting thing to me is that edition
of the DM mode right for those who are
not familiar with our previous coverage
can you give a quick elevator pitch of
the DM mode yeah absolutely it's 125
players it's a we like to call it for
with one rather than four versus one
because it's a shared storytelling
experience not a competitive experience
but yeah you get to jump in and the DM
you can do as much as creating an
ongoing campaign that can go for months
if you want to we have offline tools
where you can go through and you can
tell stories that you want to tell
create quest create locations tight
together with your own unique monsters
and villains or you can do quick dungeon
crawls that you know take five minutes
to set up and be one to ten levels of
really as large as a dungeon as you want
it to be and I was playing as the demon
are in our demo so we had a couple of
options on the screen there were
different monsters you could add
different objects what were some of the
other menus that that I was presented
with there so what you played was a tiny
campaign I created had a single dungeon
it was a small simple dungeon you have
control over a lot of different
parameters that dungeon stuff that we
saw you could create a custom monster I
believe you created a zombie you gave
him some strange coloring I don't
remember you gave many new abilities but
you did affect his stats a little bit
made a little bit tougher than the party
you named him keygen killer I believe I
am Keegan dies after our cameraman
that's right so yeah we give you a lot
of control to make your own villains or
your own enemies and then you were
dropping those guys that was great stuff
that we didn't look at today as much as
we have a location tab where you can map
out locations across the entire
forgotten realms we have quests of
course you can create we have basic
templated quest you can place quickly if
you wanted to kill quest collect quest
then we have custom stuff that you can
set up to tell whatever it is that you
want to do type in dialogue
sort of thing and that was one of the
things I did like was we were talking
about how the issue that I ultimately
run into with any type of dungeon
crawler RPG like this is hitting a wall
of tedium but I liked that we had
non-combat encounters we could add like
vendors and you mentioned quest givers
right I understand there's also a story
mode can you give us any information on
story mode absolutely we have a 40-plus
our huge campaign written by our
narrative director Jay turner he's
famous and it's really exciting we can't
wait to get people in there but you can
play it solo if you'd like to or you can
get four of your friends sorry three of
your friends bless yourself to play
through cooperatively cool is starting
mode shipping that launch absolutely
absolutely and then we were also talking
about being able to share campaigns and
dungeons and things like that how does
that work that was something cool that
we actually did today that you probably
didn't realize the campaign you play
today just this small simple dungeon
something I made in Orlando before we
came I shared it got here logged in
searched all the shared modules
downloaded it and away we went so you'd
be able to create something as simple as
complex as you want share it let anyone
else play it you have the option to make
it editable or another guy can take it
and make changes to it in DM it or you
can make it where it's just your own
thing and someone else is still DM it
but then people have the option to rate
it they also rate you as a DM so don't
be too cruel or the community will know
but yeah we're really excited bout the
sharing options very powerful yeah is
we've got the release date sep tember
29th MSRP if you preorder 3499 right now
and if you preorder you get the free DLC
range of demons that we're releasing our
first dlc consoles later the year okay
very cool so that is stored chose

description below for the full article
and other information and of course
thanks again for the demo and all the
time we've enjoyed it thank you very
much we will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
