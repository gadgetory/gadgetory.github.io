Mike from Thermaltake we're here in
their offices so Mike's gonna show us
how to do a bend and a tube for an
openly liquid cooling setup I have not
done one of these before we worked a lot
with the AI OS as you've all seen but
open-loop is something that I'm still
need to so I was hoping you could give
us an overview of how it all works oh I
am definitely very excited that you guys
are here and definitely really cool to
be able to give you the opportunity to
you know do some hard - bidding so yeah
like you know this is a PE TG tubing you
know pretty durable stuff you're not
gonna really run into issues with this
but it is also very pliable so being
able to mold and shape this to give a
really cool design for your next liquid
cold PC so what do we have here just
soap water so yeah this is just
basically you know regular soap nothing
special with water works real good
because it helps prevent the evaporation
of the water inside so there is a reason
for it right you can't use other stuff
but this cleans up the best and usually
usually pretty clean up so it definitely
serves a couple of purposes so I have my
insert that I put in here this is a
specific insert designed for this tubing
it's real important because if the
insert doesn't fit right
you go to bend this it's gonna gap out
you know you could have some weird
misshapen bends and stuff so getting the
right insert for the tube is definitely
number one now that we have this here
we're just gonna start off with like
we'll do a simple 90 bent sure got our
heat gun again nothing special I mean I
got this on the sale right you know
using the coupon you know getting the
good heat gun that's a heat gun you're
just warming up the tube so that it
becomes malleable I guess yeah so as I
spin this as you see here I just
slightly rotating it kind of you think
about you know you're cooking dinner you
know you just keep rotating it getting
even heat same with like the height here
1500 watts so it gets pretty hot I do
run it on the higher setting okay
mostly because I've done this a lot
right so you know it's kind of just from
your feel and you can see I'm starting
to get see you starting to get a little
wiggle this will just start softening up
here and you don't want to go too far
but you do want to get enough so you
know
you'll get a nice good Bend so how do
you know when to stop a lot of it's just
you know that the you know the
flexibility that I start to see in it
you were like oh okay because I can just
be like boom and just be like 90 degree
Bend you know if I need to do like a 45
or something and then we also have you
know of course our our bending kit here
this is our thermal take hard to bending
kit I got it fixed on my little board so
you know before this cools let's just
kind of get this set in here i mighta
took a little too long for that but for
the most part this will give you
basically that perfect 90 bend every
time that's what a lot of people look
for so that way everything's uniform you
know and you get those nice straight
bitchin lines everybody's looking for
you know and I mean it's it's pretty
quick I mean a lot of this stuff you
know it's still a little warm to the
touch but not too bad and then it it'll
stay rigid like this once it cools I
mean it's gonna be solid I mean I've
done some crazy stuff you know spelling
out letters you know just doing other
little bends that you can do from short
little pieces you know just going from
rad to the water block or doing bigger
runs you know from grand stuff you know
where you get some pretty crazy shapes
so a lot of this will be done here this
will be like our first Bend that we'll
have and then you know definitely
important to is that once you're done
you know make sure you'll remove your
you know your silicone insert because if
this dries inside here and you got some
wicked bends going on it'd be really
hard to get out especially if you
started to do something a little
romantic it's so yeah this is kind of
the entry level like a 90-degree Bend
let's get you a fresh and do I'm excited
this so this kit you've got what are the
other options here you have a 180 and a
360 so so say you have a you get it you
get a 360 you get the 90 and the 45 or
135 and then the 180 so your horseshoe
shapes you know your standard 90s and
45s that are more traditional a lot of
people use and then even like a 360
sometimes I can use this one I'm doing
like a 180 right and I get a tighter
u-shape I can use this to kind of
stretch it out a little bit better and
you know do something more not as
extravagant as this but you know
something more of a rounded type of
shape like that just to do a bunch of
different things because you know the
goal is to get from A to B right and you
know how creative do you want to get
go in there so I'm gonna hand this over
to your boss so here's your tube here's
your insert so silicon insert and a tube
yup and then you're just soaking in so
yeah this is just so just dip it in the
soapy water and they just want to you
just want to kind of get the whole tube
kind of wet I mean you might have to
yeah stick it in there and then just
work it down just want to make sure the
tube is you know it's got the right good
amount of liquid on it doesn't have to
be too crazy cool okay and then yeah I
should just insert right in there it
should have you know be it should be
tight but definitely pliable to be able
to go in as you want it to you know not
be loose so that way your bends are good
waiting for the youtube comments on this
yeah I know liquid cooling is the best
when it comes to talk about this stuff
all right so we've got this in now what
okay so yep heat gun time so let's let's
get this over here in a good little spot
now I mean you can do this a bunch of
different ways right one of the easiest
ways is you know setting it up like this
heat guns have this design now right you
know you'll turn your heat on here and
then as you put your tube you'll pick a
spot where you want to do your 90 and
then you just put it over maybe about an
inch away around yeah and then just
continue to rotate it now one of the
tricks is is making sure that you're
keeping it in that sense of a pace and
you're not floating around that and
forth like that so you're always heating
that same area okay and as you go yeah
spin is keeping just spit a little bit
more yeah there you go
does that go too fast and yeah just kind
of wait you'll start to see the magic
happen right it'll start to become a
little pliable yeah so there it is yeah
just keep rotating don't forget to keep
the rotating going and then once you
feel like you know you're gonna you
could bend it kind of in a 90 degree
thing it's probably gonna be pretty good
okay so it's and then was right yeah
let's go and shut this off and then
comes out yourself 90 yep and then yeah
just cut that and then usually just try
to try to push this in right here don't
don't burn yourself because it directly
warm but the I hold it there is 20
seconds yeah should be pretty good so
then it's just solidified like that you
remove the insert move the insert yeah
yeah and then now you'll be set to do
your cuts so that way you can get
everything fit you know where you're
going and or if you need to make a
Justin
and everything you can always you know
pull it out and you know don't start a
fire here yeah there we go yeah and I
mean is it is it feel like it's already
pretty rigid maybe it's a little
possible yeah but yeah you can just kind
of just wait it out a little bit a lot
of the waiting in between your shirts
bend you have to heat and you have to
cool and you want to make sure you go
slow enough so you don't interfere with
multiple bands right yeah you cool so
there's the basics of headed to a 90
degree Bend we might be looking at more
of this stuff in the future looking at
hopefully you'll something like a p3 and
then as a wet bench basically because
we're starting to get those open loop
cards in three views so thank you for
the tutorial hey absolutely
I appreciate you guys coming out yeah as
always more information in the
description below patreon link in the
post well video helps that directly
subscribe for more I'll see you all next
