Nexus tonight I am joined by Chris pate
from Logitech and we are talking about
mice and sensors and sensor technology
today we've previously discussed
keyboard technology and switches with
Vincent also from Logitech and that went
live their impact prior now we're
talking about mice so there is a new
Mouse that just came out it was
announced the G 303 the 303 has some a
heavier focus on the sensors precision
and uses a similar body to the G 302 302
so that's what's going on in terms of
mice are there any major misconceptions
with gaming mice that you feel like
gamers should better understand the
biggest thing that that probably should
be made clear is that dpi is really
about just cursor sensitivity it's not a
measure of accuracy or precision and
it's not a focus of development like for
the sensor that we are the high-end said
that we've got in the 502 302 we
developed that with the idea that we're
just going to create something
incredibly accurate and responsive and
then after we've figured out how to do
that we said okay how high can it go are
there any other any other items with
gaming mice when we're looking at
specifications that as gamers we should
be paying more attention to so really
the most important thing and it's not a
pure specification is the overall
accuracy of the sensor right so when you
you hear a lot of people talking about
inaccuracy or speed really the accuracy
variance or resolution error versus
speed but most of the time you'll hear
it is as acceleration so what that means
is that for a given physical distance
that you move a mouse depending on how
fast you move it the distance to the
cursor moves on-screen can change
there's a level of
of in accuracy that people can't pick up
on but after it exceeds that level it
becomes really annoying to try to game
with muscle memory so with sensors that
we label is Delta zero it is as close as
possible to perfect accuracy as you can
actually get what about mouth smoothing
can you what what is mouth smoothing
what is its purpose and should gamers
have it or not have it
so what smoothing does is it compares
multiple frames of data from the sensor
against each other in order to literally
smooth out the day that it's being sent
to the system so in some cases a if you
are moving the cursor along you'll see
little blips up or down they're kind of
spurious motion like that
it's called ripple and smoothing
literally it compares multiple frames of
data against each other to remove or
it's a lesson that ripple so one of the
side effects of this is that depending
on how many frames of information you're
comparing against each other like you
can have multiple milliseconds of delay
between what the mouse is doing and what
the cursor is showing on screen
smoothing is a smoothing has a negative
impact on cursor feel particularly at
startup so from zero to moving smoothing
increases the time between when the
mouse starts moving and when you
actually see the cursor move and it
becomes more perceptible as frame rates
go higher and as monitors start to
refresh faster so it's more easy to pick
up on 120 Hertz around 44 Hertz monitor
than it is on a 60 Hertz monitor what
about a mouse acceleration is is that a
also something we don't want a Gary
Mouse or in general yeah acceleration or
or speed relative accuracy variance is
detrimental to the gamers ability to
play by muscle memory to do repeated
motions through practice without having
to to rely solely on what they can see
and so you just said I think speed
related accuracy very high accuracy
variance is there a reason you're using
my vs. so acceleration implies that it's
an inherent feature of the sensor when
really it's a it's a characteristic that
is made visible by changing the speed
that the mouse is moving right so the
depending on how fast the mouse is
moving you can get different the degrees
of motion on-screen so it's an accuracy
issue that is exposed by changing
physical speed of the mouse so with the
g502 and the G 302 303 sorry the we're
using the pmw 33 66 which is the most
advanced sensor that we have access to
and the the really kind of great thing
about this sensor is in addition to the
fact that it's got zero smoothing across
the entire dpi range so either from 200
for 12,000 you don't have any
post-processing that will add latency to
the cursor in order to mitigate rip
polar or other spurious motion but it
was not designed with the intent of
pushing the DPI up it was a design with
the intent of creating as pure and and
connected if a cursor experience or
point of view experience as you can get
with with current technology right so we
first designed the sensor and then we
said okay now that we've got this great
experience with zero smoothing how far
can we push it and keep the same
experience and 12,000 is is where we
decided to cut it off and ultimately I
guess as a buyer you probably want to
look at other features in the mouse
aside from the DPI number certain
including the controller used or the or
the sensor I should say that's used yeah
absolutely
in terms of dpi is that a is that a
marketing heavy number at this point is
does it still bear weight where does it
bear relevance to the consumer so dpi is
literally just sensitivity you know so
12000 dpi is just more sensitive than
10000 dpi that's it the cursor moves
faster we're not trying to like say you
need 12,000 dpi to be more accurate this
is what the sensor is capable of so
we're giving you the
to access it you can use it or not we're
trying to give people more margin than
they need right same thing with like the
sensor can track it up to 300 inches per
second the majority of people will never
exceed like 80 inches per second base of
our testing right so for pro gamers who
make a ton of money by relying on this
hardware to do exactly - what they
needed to do or exactly what they
expected to do the ability to be totally
confident that you can't move the mouse
faster than it can actually track is
incredibly beneficial so a mouse is
tracking on a 2d plane or moving the
mouse on a 2d plane but we're
interpreting it for a 3d gaming space
what are what are some of the concerns
in that scenario as it pertains to
design sensors it's maybe outside a lot
of tech science sensors or making sure
that data is received accurately by the
game and so this this ditz gets really
complex and by default every count that
it receives from from from the mouse
driver turns like some million 0.22
degrees right and what you're trying to
do is is ensure that you don't have a
level of sensitivity versus a level dpi
that causes you to jump from pixel to
pixel and potentially miss a head shot
or something like that so there's a
lotta arcane and and almost voodoo math
that goes into ray into making these
decisions but pros have kind of settled
on 400 or 800 dpi as being their
preferred starting point and they adjust
their sensitivity to what feels good
ultimately it's just like any other
component of the mouse right the shape
you you buy a shape that's comfortable
right that's what you start with you you
try to find a sensor that performs the
way that you wanted to initiate this
comfortable and you try to find settings
that are compatible with in the game and
the mouse sensor and mount of shape that
are that are
going to give you a comfortable
experience attitude so it's all about
setting it up so that it feels
comfortable and natural to you so that
you can not have to worry about
compensating for any kind of
irregularities and just focus on the
game itself right so for more
information on mice sensors the hardware
links in the description below
the g3 o3 we already have an article
online for that so check that out and
that is linked for you as well and we'll
see you all next time thanks for your
time Chris it's your thing thank you
