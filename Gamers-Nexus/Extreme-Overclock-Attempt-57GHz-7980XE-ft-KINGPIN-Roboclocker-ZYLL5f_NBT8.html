with kingpin who's got this setup so
this is the Robo clock er right we were
talking about this a TV Jay's
headquarters the other day you've made a
couple changes though before we get into
all the overclocking key tell me about
what you did here versus the other day I
put a straight pipe on the back to add a
little more drama for the crowd yes so
now we've gotten an exhaust basically
straight into our faces the system is
currently running at 5.6 gigahertz right
yep 79 80 XC running 5.6 time spy and I
think I don't know what our our goal
here is for frequency but we're gonna
push it a bit further before that this
video is brought to you by thermal takes
view 37 case the vo 37 focuses on
highlighting custom PC builds with its
full panoramic window and tinted front
acrylic and our thermal testing the view
37 performed reasonably well when
considering its looks focused build
which is partly thanks to the airflow
design and the removal of a bottom power
supply shroud for a balance of looks and
performance check the link in the
description below for the view 37 and if
you don't know what the system is
basically quick recap the Robo clock er
has this Inlet hooked up to it
to a liquid nitrogen tank off camera and
that's feeding liquid nitrogen straight
into the system it's going through two
valves to either the CPU or the GPU and
those can be open or closed based on
what our technician over here Stu 810
and he types in a value and then they
can bring down the temperature to reach
that target value he types it in that's
right it's like a Formula One team so
what are we what's the first step here
so the first step is test the limits of
the CPU the CPU is good for about 5.7 so
I think that's the target I want to
check make sure that the CPU is stable
can run and then we start to worry about
the GPU but focus on CPU first cool okay
so we're at five six now what what what
a voltage do you have right now we're
using 1.5 v core and about two point
three five on the VI n for the 79 80 XE
so that's why you take it away I guess
for the next step
I actually 1.5 is enough to max the CPU
out it'll do 5700 at 1.5 easy maybe
about 10 more degrees I think should get
us there what are we what are we
operating at right now
50 650 600 temperature temperature about
minus 85 but this CPU can actually do
around minus 100 so what's on the bat
you have a socket heater on the back
here right he walk us through I didn't
cover that in the original video we had
a cover right well the socket heater
keeps the socket warm and it keeps the
condensation from forming in the socket
it's actually really key so I came in
this morning and set this up 9:00 a.m.
it's been running time spy ever since
non-stop not one crash if it didn't have
that socket heater this system would
have been done a long time ago for sure
very cool so we got a succeeded
hopefully through this run 5.6 gigahertz
we KCBS score man I mean the system can
do this no problem
very nice so what's what's what's your
next objective where you going frequency
you next let's try five seven well let's
try five point seven the limit of this
CPU is a little over five point seven on
the best day so if this thing can do
five seven I would be pretty happy with
that in three seven cache and what are
what are you adjusting right now
basically I set the ring ratio to 37 and
I set all the CPU multipliers to 57 I'm
using you know I'm setting all the rage
all the cores to the same ratio so using
fixed ratio overclocking and this is
what the EVGA eally utility yeah elite
this one's a beta version but yeah it's
it's ru elite utility so yeah
Australians let's try five point seven
see if it'll work what uh so 980 XE is
pretty well known for power consumption
any idea what kind of power consumption
you're pushing what's the highest power
we hit on 79 80
900 watts man 900 watts that's pretty
crazy
all right sir we're going into graphics
test one what's the GPU setup for right
now right now the GPU is I think it's
running maybe nineteen hundred or two
thousand we didn't pull the GPU down yet
we want to make sure the CPUs solid
system is running good then we bring the
GPU down all right so 900 watts or
something like that and what I guess
while we're waiting for this to run
let's go through the rest of the system
here so it kind of recap the basics of
the Robo clock or what I didn't talk
about is why did you call it
Robo clock er um that's specifically
what's the automated part well the Robo
because it sounds kind of like
overclocker right and this thing sort of
replaces the big joke at work is I'm out
of a job now because we have this
machine so we're kind of like it's not
really an overclocker it's a robo
clocker so there's a name kind of fits
what's what all is automated I know you
have a software set up on the laptop to
set the target temperature so we type in
the temperature
I guess the valve is open or closed
based on what temperature these
thermocouples are reading here and also
12 volt sensing and loading sensing for
the CPU and the CPU so that's mostly the
timing the timing of the ln2 delivery
like it'll it'll hit fast it'll it'll
sustain the ln2
or it'll cut it off depending on what it
needs the power so what is it what do
you do now no you don't have to poor
Alan's here any new hobbies' you know
it's cool for the show right I mean it's
a little more dramatic than pouring I
think it's like the next level but yeah
yeah I think it's time for me to take up
a new hobby oh no maybe maybe mining who
knows something else
I don't know mining with this yeah yeah
that'd be the next step right like seven
GPUs on vows ATP is it'd be crazy
alright so other components in the
system we're still going through time
spy right now looks like it's stable
that's good other components X 299 dark
for the motherboard I can see that on
the back plate what do you have set up
I'm assuming all EVGA parts of course
2007 for the power supply 1600 t2 great
PSU for 79 80
see I don't can't really beat it and we
got the Titan V and G skill tried in C
memory ddr4 and the Titan V is modded as
we mentioned earlier yes it has some
mods on it well one of the easier mods
is just the two fans right so it's got a
couple of fans on the vrm components
then you have a custom block from Robo
clock or on the GPU and another one on
the CPU it's cool to show it a lot
mostly positive response oh it's got a
blue screen on what was your okay
storing BIOS now I max - 99 dark and
basically I'm setting it up for fire
strike so fire strike really is runs the
best on 16 cores 32 threads so I'm
disabling the last two cores on the
processor to get the best score if you
leave it at 1836 you you get a bad score
at first or some load balancing issue in
the software or something I think so
right I don't think he utilizes all
those cores so let's see let's see if
it's stable and fire strike give it
stable we'll push the card a little bit
so you're gonna rename yourself on
Hardware bots on 3d mark on all these
sites just discussing that like who gets
credit who who gets who gets credit for
the scores now right are they are they
my scores
alright so let's put the CPU of 5 7
because we know she's stable what's the
highest score you got in time spot I
don't remember we did the we also had at
79 80 XE and I think we stopped at I was
running all 18 threat or cores I think
we had 14 9 for the multiplier for the
first two cores than 48 for the rest but
I can remember the score
eh Steve I bet five seven on the CPU and
then maybe let's set 2150 on the card
2150 on the Titan me yeah what's the
highest you gotta so I think we capped
it out with an offset of about a hundred
megahertz we did so we did 200 but I
think originally when the Titan B's were
new afterburner was reading every offset
as x 2.so or divided by 2 or some offset
of 2x but yeah that'll be our target
what was your highest score alright so
for reference for x by when we did our
run we were at 15,000 494 for total
score just four times by non-extreme
graphics we were at 15,000 284 CPU were
at 16,000 803 and then four times by
extreme I think we were closer to
something like 8200 something I've had
total score okay so what are you what
are you expecting a hit
this should be easily be 16 something
and like easily mid 16
I think first run total score be nice if
we get over 17 yeah that's what I want
to see the idea of time spy extreme know
I like time spy extreme we liked it
because I'm not it's easier for me to
work with a GPU them CPU here because
I'm not as experienced so it takes a lot
of the work off of the CPU you don't
need to really do much in terms by
extreme right it doesn't doesn't it
wicked man it looks better with a
straight pipe yeah I think it looks
killer just want our camera lines to be
frozen over by the end of it they're
getting some nice air conditioning over
there it's like getting there right so
awesome
all right so uh so walk me through what
we're doing right now you've been
running around a little bit we thought
we might have a potential short or
something on the SSD but you retained
that you've never run it this cold
really in the lab eats more more for
show yeah I mean this is a demo system
right so I plugged in in at nine o'clock
and it's been running all day and for
reference it's like 4:00 p.m. now yeah
it's yeah and you can see how much I
mean it's ridiculous how much ice is on
it it's really a lot of ice so there
could be water someplace but anyways
let's keep going maybe we can see if
we're back fight it back okay so it
looks like her back maybe had a bit of a
scare with potentially numbs out too as
his D short or something like that but
after what cycling CMOS and rebooting
it's back up
it's back up and running so let's uh
let's get it running again in terms by
offset here 125 percent power target
core you're going four plus two hundred
offset with precision
let's go like this specifically 230
knobs 150 on the HBM - where do you find
the HBM - typically first how does HP
I'm to do with cold does it really it
doesn't care it doesn't it doesn't do
well all my cards the tight ends they
all overclock higher on air and then
when I put them on L into the memory
clock will go down what's your highest
I'm spy extreme score is my extreme I
think we said it as total scores 8245
something like that okay let's see what
this can do this looks fantastic I was
thinking I imagine like if you did like
a case mad was like an engine and at the
pipes and like all the exhaust if it
looked so cool so we've got time spike
strange still running 5.7 on the CPU I
lowered it a little bit I set it to five
five but I put the mesh at 37 because as
you know thanks back shame it's not so
CPU defended right can still get a great
score with even 5g and then the GPU are
offset 213 megahertz which I'm guessing
is just a number you pre-tested a know
to be stable yeah it's like always like
the starting clock but this card
actually can do almost 2300 so this one
passes and everything's good then I'll
probably leave the CPU alone and then
just bring up the GPU maybe plus 50 plus
50
on the CBO test it's the last one it's
combined neck no there's no combining
this one combined an entire spine for
killer though
AVX workload really tough on the cpu
noticed that time spiciness memory
intensive as well oh yeah it's not bad
they crashed didn't make it so he passed
on the GPS 74 43 do you be the stable
but so walk me through what's going on
right now right now we're trying to
calibrate the controller with the actual
reading temp that you're saying what's
your ideal temperature for the speed
you're going for mmm this CPU right now
needs about minus 85 real temperature on
the evaporator but - what was it it was
that minus 60 when I saw it five seven
stable man so what do we have for score
should be should be nice decent CPU
score yep 20k so that's good that's what
I want to see it's what snacks I'd try
and push the CPU further are you going
for GPU let's try this all right so it
took a little while but we finally got
through a bunch of benchmarking for the
CPU score we end up with 20 k plus n
times pi that's on a 79 80 XE 5.7
gigahertz which is pretty impressive
considering again with era and with a
deal it in liquid metal we were doing
something like 4.8 4.9 so you have 5.7
with this thing and significantly higher
score than what we could achieve earlier
so what do you what do you plan to do
with this now once copy text ends I mean
are you actually gonna use this thing or
what oh yeah for sure man I will use
this probably for all my benchmark
records we're thinking about doing for
way next so go after some 4 Way records
on 1080 Ti so four-way on an open-air
batch I guess with a CPU on it - so you
got five total loose
right yes yeah his controller has five
channels so we can run four GPUs and one
CPU and I probably won't use the case I
like I kind of like having everything
out on the table it's more more suited
than my style of benching yeah it makes
sense so as always if you missed the
original coverage of this thing we've
got it on the channel subscribe for more
copies ex coverage or just check the
link below for this thing because I
talked about it in depth and EB jhq
earlier this week and Vince thank you
for joining me no problem thank you
we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
