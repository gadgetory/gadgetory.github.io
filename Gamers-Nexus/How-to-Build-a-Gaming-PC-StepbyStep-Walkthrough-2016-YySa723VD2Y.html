darn easy as a lot of you know there's
only a couple of screws and then maybe
seven components there used to be eight
core components but with the
obsolescence of optical drives we've
dropped down and consolidated to about
seven on average so this video it talks
about how to build a gaming PC and we're
going to go over the basics of assembly
cable management and initial setup and
before we get to that some quick notes
here PC building is very modular but
there are of course some compatibility
issues so you need to make sure that
your socket type is compatible with the
CPU need to make sure that the memory is
compatible with the CPU and the
motherboard you can check all these
lists online and check the article links
in the description below for a lot more
information on compatibility checking
how you can learn to do it yourself
rather than use a tool to do it and what
you need to know with parts selection
for our build we have sort of a modular
PC build here and that is demonstrate
just how much these components can
change between different use cases for
different users so in our setup we have
two video card options two CPU options
and a couple of different memory options
the core setup here uses an msi gtx 970
or gtx 980 depending on what we want to
do really and this is sort of a
production rig for us we're going to use
it internally you can see it already
assembled here and this will be used for
video production things like that so
we're using the GTX 980 but if you
wanted to lower your cost you could drop
in something like the msi 970 gaming 4g
card here it's a four gigabyte card and
then for the motherboard we've gotten
MSI is z170a
sli board and that's for you can do sli
of course but we're not doing that here
we're just doing one card for the rest
of it the CPU cooler that of course goes
atop the 6700 k6 700k no longer includes
a CPU cooler so we're using this this is
an anti Mac's ets t40 fit there's an
aftermarket cooler that'll give us some
overclocking Headroom on our 6700 K
alternatively you could select something
like an i-5 6400 or 6500 which is one of
our parts and that would give you the
option of not overclocking and reducing
your price you can even go down to an on
z
set because the Z chipset on the the
motherboard down here is actually for
overclocking and things of that nature
some higher-end functions and the BIOS
power supply of course powers it all and
we're using an anorak digit fanless
power supply for that this this is
actually just a lower wattage PSU and
you can see in our guide you normally
don't need that much wattage especially
for a 970 build and that has no fan so
it's going to be quieter and then it's
got braided cables which is a nice add
as well SSD we're using an OC z drive
arc 100 drive that I picked up for this
build and then we'll throw in some kind
of one terabyte storage for archival
purposes and then the memory we're
running at Corsairs at vengeance LP X
memory which is 3200 megahertz
you can definitely drop the frequency on
this this is a ddr4 kit because skylake
requires ddr4 for this particular
motherboard now Scylla can do ddr3l and
some boards will do ddr3 it's definitely
a bit of a push but we're using ddr4
memory for this because that's the
motherboards built for and then the
speed is good for production tasks video
processing things like that and you can
read and view our content on dual
channel configurations the past if you
want to see how it affects the type of
tasks you do gaming not a huge impact
but we're running a 32 gigabyte kit
alternatively you could run a 16
gigabyte kit and that would be sort of
the cheaper option of course and then to
put everything in we're using an NZXT h4
40 v2 case that's this black case over
here with some of the sound damping foam
and things like that so that is our mid
tower case for this build tools for a PC
build are extremely limited and easy and
accessible you probably have them
already or at least one of them and that
is a Phillips screwdriver and then we
have this ESD wrist strap so it's an
anti-static wrist strap that grounds you
if you use it properly and a lot of
people don't use it correctly so if you
are previous content on anti-static
materials and setup and you'll see how
to build one of these cables and use it
correctly so the way we do it is we cut
the head off of a normal power supply
cable that we're not going to use we
bend the hot pins that go into the walls
we bend those so they don't go into the
wall because if they go
to the wall and you do this incorrectly
it's not good please follow our previous
guide on that but you do that cut the
cable and then just give direct access
to the copper for the sort of alligator
clip on the anti-static wrist strap you
want to make sure it's connected to the
ground wire and that you've covered up
safely any of the hot wires in there
again previous video for that but that's
what we're going to use to make sure
we're grounded during the build process
and make sure nothing gets shocked if
you feel a shot come from your finger to
a component like you would with a car
door there's a very good chance you've
damaged something even at a sort of low
level or a latent ESD event something
like that so be careful building those
are really the only things you need to
know with assembly before getting
started the rest of it is just screwing
in a couple Phillips screws and then
you're pretty much done and connecting
the cables of course so let's get
started we're first going to build this
out of the case the reason we do that is
to make sure everything works and
because it's a lot easier to get the CPU
cooler in there before installing the
motherboard into the case so we'll do
the CPU the RAM installation the CPU
cooler installation will test everything
with the power supply and then once we
know it's all good and functional we'll
put it in the case and call it a day
ok so first we're going to install the
system as much as possible outside of
the case and the reason for that is
because if something goes wrong you want
to know about it before you do all the
work of installing it in the case and
doing all the cabling so just trust me
on that
to get the CPU and there you remove the
CPU socket cover on the motherboard
which I've just done and you want to
keep that cover for warranty reasons the
Intel CPUs have two notches on either
side and you can line those notches up
with the little nubs that stick up on
the CPU socket itself and there's also
an arrow pointing to the bottom left
corner in this case but you can of
course correlate that with your socket
and the has pins in the CPU rather than
in the socket and that you can align by
looking at their missing pins where they
have transistors and things like that
and align those and then for the MDC
peas they also have an arrow on the
corner so we've got the CPU installed do
the cooler in a minute first let's do
the memory installation so for memory
you can run either four sticks or two
sticks ideally for the dual channel
setup
this particular platform and that is a
that is dependent on the cpu
architecture so this is a dual-channel
build we're assembling you can see here
if you install this way that is the only
way it will not fit so the role with Ram
is if you apply pressure and it doesn't
go stop and so you line this little
notch here up with this one rotate it
accordingly you install it and pop these
little pins out here and then once you
push down you apply some force and
you'll hear it snap so that means that
we've installed it correctly it is
seated all the way very important to be
seated all the way and in this case
we're installing all four sticks so
we'll use all four slots but if you're
only doing two sticks then you need to
look at the manual and figure out which
two slots you use to get the maximum
memory capacity dual channels not really
that critical for gaming we've done
testing on it you can actually look it
up on the channel but we're going to run
it because we're doing a build that is
very heavily targeted for production use
internally at the site that means we
want the fastest memory we can get and
that's why we're running this event lpx
set up at 3200 megahertz
with the proper dual channel
configuration so that we can render out
videos as quickly as possible so that's
how you install the memory and the CPU
now we'll do the CPU cooler so now we're
going to install the CPU cooler this
part is one of the more tedious of
building systems actually normally the
most difficult demand what board you
have so we're using a z series board and
unless you're running an extreme series
Intel motherboard it does take a bit
more work to install one of these CPU
coolers but it's not that bad first of
all you've got a backplate that goes on
the backside of the motherboard if
you're on an AMD you'll have to remove
it unless you're running an aftermarket
cooler that uses the stock backplate and
then there's these different retention
errs that are used and will depend on
the cooler that you purchase so this is
not the exact same you'll see for every
CPU cooler out there certainly not the
same for liquid coolers and we do have
an alternative automatic slick Mattox
cooler if we wanted to run a liquid
cooler for this setup so for this
process you basically first need to put
on the thermal paste if it's not pre
applied as
on liquid coolers these days and when
you're putting on the thermal face we
have a few videos on this generally
about the size anywhere from a grain of
rice to a pea depending on how large the
CPU itself is and we like to apply it in
the center and then torque down the CPU
cooler to spec and that will spread out
the thermal paste appropriately across
the surface the point of the thermal
paste is just to fill microscopic
imperfections in the surface and it's
really not supposed to fill the whole
plate the whole cold plate because that
is actually worse than copper contact if
copper contact can be made direct to CPU
mount that on top of the CPU by
following the instructions and then you
want to tighten the corners across from
each other or not don't tighten one side
or one screw all at once you definitely
want to do opposing corners for
tightening to distribute the weight
evenly so that's how you install the CPU
cooler make sure it's all good and tight
not going to fall out and then once
you're done with that plug in the four
pin CPU fan header to the specific CPU
fan plug on the motherboard don't plug
it into a chassis fan port and if you're
running a liquid cooler there's only a
pump power as well plug that in as your
manual instructs you all right so take a
good look at this this board is flexing
a lot right now
not good for the board not good for
anything on it this will happen if you
over tighten those screws so always go
with monkey tight not gorilla tight on
these you basically just want to be sort
of hand tight tight enough to hold it
down and apply pressure but not tight
enough to do this with the board so
that's what we want to avoid that is why
you do not ever over tighten screws on a
CPU cooler because it can do damage to
the system in the long term or even the
immediate future thank you this found
the point of tension okay so to finalize
our build outside of the case before
assembling everything we're going to
plug in the video card you'll want to
hang this over the edge of your table
I'm not doing it here for demonstration
purposes but you'll plug in the video
card in the top PCIe slot hang that back
silver plate over the edge of the table
and then get your power supply ready you
need the 24 pin which 24 pin goes in
right here and then you need the CPU EPS
12 volts header which goes in over here
near the CPU cooler so that's your 8 pin
in this case sometimes their 4 pin so
you plug those two cables in from the
power supply mount your video card and
then connect to your appropriate PCIe
cables Aziz you've got two banks right
here so you connect those run the power
to the wall to the power supply
flip the on switch on the power supply
and then you can hit if there is one
present hit a power button it would
normally be up here on the motherboard
and that will turn the board on if
there's not one present we have a video
on jumpin a motherboard electrically to
jump a start signal to it it's pretty
easy and as you can see here you would
basically take your screwdriver locate
the front panel headers you got two
banks here and then find the one that is
the power switch that's not a PWR
underscore SW and you would jump the two
pins that are appropriate to that switch
to get it to turn on alright so now you
install the board into the case if you
want the i/o shield which I do not do
you want the i/o shield you put that in
there before you put the motherboard in
of course and you need these standoffs
in here before you install the board
those standoffs are the black things
that are sticking up sometimes they are
a sort of brass color and those are used
to prevent a direct short so they go in
there to basically screw in the screws
in to which I'm doing right now there
eight of them and you want the standoffs
rather than straight into the case which
would potentially drag the board into
the into the steel plate on the case and
that would cause a direct short which
would mean your system would not boot so
you do all eight of these screws do not
skimp on these and once you've got those
in we'll do the power supply the power
supply cables and the video card last
for ease along with the storage devices
so now we're going to install the power
supply for NZXT h4 40s through 40 and
for Corsairs new 600 c
do this thing where the power spot is
actually in a separate compartment and
that is because they use a power supply
shroud which is what's in here and that
hides all the cabling makes things a lot
cleaner to install so those things have
these brackets this is not standard you
will not find this in every case it has
become somewhat of a standard this year
but it is not really in everything just
yet so you won't have those everywhere
but we're going to take the power supply
obviously on the side that connects the
cables to be inside the case and then we
want to expose the side with the power
plug to the rear of the the case here
and we want the fan pointed down in this
instance because that's the only way for
it to breathe so we're going to line
this up with the four holes that are
present for the power supply and screw
it in and then we'll be good to go
so now we're going to install the video
card all you need to do here is look for
the appropriate slot you don't really
want the top one and remove the cases
sort of panel protectors in the back
when you're ready to install this all it
does is sock it in it so it's just like
Ram where you get the sort of pop which
is what we just felt there and if you
want to remove it you push down a peg in
the back that's over here and then you
can just pull it out like that it should
never require any force to install or
remove if it does something's wrong stop
and look at it and figure it out
so we're going to socket this in by
lining up the rear i/o shield and then
slot that and then it's just a matter of
installing a couple of screws into the
expansion base for the case so we've got
two screws for that use both screws
because it will help prevent videocards
sag if I only use one here you'll see
that it's actually sort of sagging a bit
and that's not really good for anything
so installing two screws will help stop
that from happening and I would
recommend just sort of saving the
cabling for last and install this video
card first do the cables later and maybe
check to make sure there's not any SATA
or USB 3 cable in under the
video card that you should install first
so that's how you do the video card the
SSD we've got installed down here
already and for this particular case is
a little bit different than most cases
because that's just egos on top of the
PSU shroud it's literally just two or
four screws depending on what kind of
case you're using you install it you
mount it into a bracket and then later
on you connect the cables so that's all
there is to the SSD installation nothing
special there now we're going to do the
cabling and this is the hardest part of
the entire process which is saying a lot
because it's really not that hard
otherwise so first off two main cables
for the motherboard there's the 24 pin
power and eight or four pin power for
the CPU and the 24 pins located to the
right of the RAM all you do is line up
the clip with the clip on the socket
plug it in do not force it if you force
it and it goes in the wrong way you will
cause damage to something and then you
plug in the eight pin just the same way
up near the CPU so those are the two
main ones a lot of people overlook that
CPU header and if you do your system
won't turn on normally won't be damaged
but it won't turn on
so next after we've got those two power
headers in the board there's a couple
other power cables to plug into the
board for various things like fans and
those fan headers are the three or four
pin ones they used to be white now
they're white or black and three pin
means it is not PWM or pulse width
modulated and four pin means that it is
which means that the fan speed can be
controlled by the motherboard directly
you want that
so take the CPU header plug the CPU
header in directly to the motherboard in
the CPU slot if you didn't already do
that in our previous step where we built
the board outside the case and assemble
the CPU cooler next if it's a liquid
coil you plug in the three pin power
from the CLC to an appropriate header
and that if you got case fans you plug
in those case fans to other three pin
headers or four pin headers across the
board now some cases like our NZXT h4 40
have fan hubs in the back and so instead
of plugging your fans into the board you
want to plug those into the fan hub so
you plug it into the rear of the case
it's a lot cleaner has some control
options a lot of over voltage protection
things like that plug it in there and
then you plug that fan hub into the
power supply directly no
via 4-pin molex or SATA power connector
in this case it's for pin molex so those
all connected the next thing to look at
is the front panel headers and front
panel headers are exactly what they
sound like they are cables or wires with
headers on them and they come from the
front of the case normally for USB to
USB 3 and the power switch and LED items
on the front of the case so the power
switch plugs in with other front panel
control headers in the normally bottom
right of the board you want to look for
something like at p1 or jf p2 and then
you check the legend on the board if
there's not one present check your
manual it is not standard it's different
for every board for the most part and
you plug in corresponding cables so the
thing to look out for here if it is a
positive and negative cable set and it
cares which way they're plugged in you
basically just want the text pointing
outward so if it's in the top row of
front panel headers you plug it in with
the text facing up it's in the bottom
row you plug it in with the text facing
down and you plug in the power switch to
reset switch HDD led and power led if
you want those things if you don't want
the lights don't plug them in the next
thing also down in this area is the USB
2 headers for USB 2 in the front of the
case if you have that in that instance
you just look for the USB two headers
it's a cluster of about eight or so pins
and there's one missing
line it up plug it in you're done with
that try and manage these cables by
routing them appropriately through the
behind area of the case before
connecting them that way you can keep it
all really clean and just do all the
tied ons at the end and you can just use
those grommeted holes or what-have-you
for your case to route things and manage
them cleanly
after the USB 2 header is plugged in
it's time to connect the audio header
that is for the 3.5 milimeter jacks in
the front if present that would be HD
audio that's normally in the bottom left
of the board when oriented in a standard
rotation standing up in a normal case
finally USB 3.0 that's of course present
on basically everything now if you have
an three-plus boards a lot of those
don't have it still but you plug in the
USB 3 header into a special I think it's
a 20 pin
socket that's almost always located
basically adjacent to the 24-pin power
header you want to do this before you
connect your video card generally and
that be very careful with it because
those pins will Bend and it's just like
a CPU socket where it's a nightmare to
unbend them so plug that in line up the
notch with the gap in the socket plastic
shroud and make sure that lines up and
you'll be good to go so that covers all
of the front panel headers for the
standard case covers the power headers
for the motherboard and all that's left
for us is the GPU power so once you've
mounted your GPU and I normally do this
last personally you mount the GPU or the
video card and then you connect your six
and eight pin power headers from the
power supply into that as appropriate
try and route and manage them before you
connect them and you'll be good to go
there's one last main set of cables to
plug in and that's for the storage
devices so whether you've got an SSD or
a 3.5 inch hard drive they use the same
type of headers the only time it's
different is if you've got an MDOT two
device that connects to the board and in
that case it's still pretty darn simple
you just connect the SSD I'm not - form
factor directly into the socket you
screw it down no cables involved
whatsoever the board will power that
device for an SSD like we're using a 2.5
inch sort of standard SSD or if you have
a hard drive you need a SATA cable is
come with the motherboard plug in the
SATA cable line up the L brackets with
the receiving end on each side try and
manage it before you connect it and then
line up the L bracket for of course the
SATA power which is that sort of thin
l-shaped cable it's not at all like the
other power option for fans which would
be the four pin molex so you plug the
SATA power SATA data in and then that
takes care of the drive we've taken care
of the board the GPU the fans and the
front panel headers with USB to USB 3
and HD audio all connected as well I
don't think I'm missing anything there's
not much else in 99% of builds but if
you've got special hubs or controllers
or lights then check the instructions
and apply cables as necessary
so that's it that's all you have to do
to build a system pretty easy at the end
of the day once you get good it only
takes a few minutes to do even though
that first run-through might be a couple
hours whereas case scenario for
troubleshooting steps if you run into
issues with booting search our Channel
for troubleshooting you'll find a guide
where we talk about things to do we've
got articles on the website of course as
well for troubleshooting system boot
problems and then your next steps would
be installing Windows Linux or some
other OS and installing your core
applications I use ninite for installing
sort of bulk applications like Libre a
LibreOffice or OpenOffice or Chrome or
whatever you can use one program to do
that or do it manually and then once
you're done with that that's it you can
use your system as normally you will
want to look at bios or UEFI before
getting too deep into things and
installing your OS though make sure it's
up to either AHCI or nvme or whatever is
appropriate for your build and if you
have questions about that you can check
our forums gamers nexus dotnet go to the
forums and we'll help you out with PC
