overclocking and our hashtag rip J
hashtag rip Paul stream following up our
critically-acclaimed hashtag repeal TT
stream you missed a lot because kingpin
joined in for a bit in chat yes it was
the actual kinsman we verified it with
EVGA live during the stream and Jay was
in chat Paul or Paul's wife I'm not sure
one of the two was on Paul's account
during during the stream joining on chat
and Paul just got his own on V link
bridges so now looks like the battle is
really just getting going even though we
tried to end it earlier by taking number
one on the treaty mark times by extreme
hall of fame for now wait a minute
j-just place to score 101 points higher
than ours while we were filming this
video so we're gonna come at this with a
lot more mods next time but it's still
important to go through the recap of all
the hardware for the last streams like
you get up to where we are now and then
check back for the modded version of
this later before that this video is
brought to you by Power colors red
dragon Vega 56 which is now below MSRP
on new I got $380 with a rebate from the
28th to the 30th of September when we
first tested Vega 56 we found the card
competitive and fun for tweaking and
modding and now that it's back in stock
it's worth the consideration
Vega 56 also comes with three free games
including Assassin's Creed Odyssey star
control and a strange Brigade while
supplies last
learn more at the link below kingpin
says I'm benching with J what that's how
is that fair huh 14 862
that's good 1141 you know I wanted to
that's the same exact scores last time
that's consistent the only huije there
is I'm not no idea why Vince said that I
think he's Charlie here I don't know who
to believe before we get into all the
overclocking numbers the bios settings
the GPU settings all that stuff we did
we did have a secret weapon in here and
I'll get to that too actually couple
secret weapons but the bench itself was
the primary weapon and this thing is one
of the craziest benches we've ever built
it could certainly be better we could do
more with liquid cooling on the GPUs but
just a point a few things out the
hardware used for the stream so we have
a super fat radiator it's a 360 rad and
I just through whatever fans we had
available on it so we've got a soon on
maglev fan which is running at 3000 rpm
right now in fact it's blowing so hard
that I can feel the air all the way over
here about 10 feet away and then maybe
10 12 feet away one of the cardboard
boxes on our set shelf is moving from
the wind so a lot of air flow going on
on the bench to Corsair ml fans are on
there as well with the soon on fan so
all of our heaviest Duty cooling is on
the CPU and the reason for that is
because we have trouble getting this 79
80 X e to stabilize that anything higher
than 4.8 gigahertz so having all that
cooling helps us get to 4.9 on a couple
cores but not all J has us handily beat
there his CPU goes up as high as 5.1
although he and I were talking or both
experiencing concerns of potential cpu
quality degradation at this point but
his CPU definitely goes higher he can
make up a lot of points there our memory
is helping us out - we've got G scale
Triton Z hit set to 4000 mega so it can
do 3600 is the xmp:rating but we've got
it to 4,000 go over the settings later
then of course the actual star of the
show was the env link bridge and the
GPUs so for this we have an EVGA XC
ultra card that is unmodified completely
there's no shunt mod or anything then on
the front card we have that setup with
our hybrid cooling solution which is
just a it's the only radiator that would
fit that I had to be quiet it's not
looped to a tee we used it for the Titan
V as well and that's hooked up on the
GPU core the memory so when we checked
during the stream just you check with
thermocouples and then validate it was
something like an IR just an IR gun for
the temperature and as long as it's a
blackbody you don't have any emissivity
issues then you can get a pretty
accurate measurement it's not like it's
reflective copper or something like that
so just taking readings with the
somewhat accurate IR me a gun or
thermocouple we get about 50 degrees
Celsius on the hottest memory module
when it's under load and that is
something like 20 or 30 below stock with
the stock Nvidia cooler so we did pretty
well
on cooling the vrm and the RAM and that
is because used the as the verge would
call them tweezers to hook up a 120 fan
to the back this is a gentle typhoon fan
it's known for its reliability but it's
okay for airflow too so that's shoving
air into the left half of the vrm for
both cards it's also getting air over
the memory modules where we need it we
have just a knock to 140 up here as
exhaust we have a knock to 140 in the
front for intake into the vram and then
the GPU cooling for the second card is
hooked up with two ml 140s and those did
a decent job but at this point the next
thing we need to do is probably fill a
bucket with ice and chill one of the
radiators so whether that is the GP or
the cpu radiator not sure we're both hey
you buy an actual big like proper cooler
like you would take I don't know to the
beach or something and fill that with
ice that's probably the better way to go
and then liquid cool both cards right
now we're being held back most by the
EVGA card which is air-cooled and while
the card is fine it's getting hot for
what we're doing and that's because we
have our secret secret weapon on it
which is a BIOS mod so here's the deal
with that this card by default goes to a
130 percent power offset so stock it's
plus 1 30 percent for the power target
we worked with the XOC community and I
believe soda J and both of us got a V
bios build that goes to one 54 percent
offset so the core gets pretty damn hot
it's it's 70s 80s depending on what test
is running how long it's been running
and that impacts clocks heavily because
n videos boosts algorithm I get or their
boost stepping really it's a lookup
table the boost lookup table kind of
freaks out once you get past 28 degrees
Celsius and it starts down stepping all
the way so you drop clocks at like 28
drop clocks at temperatures all the way
up until 63 70 179 and so forth so
colder we can get this card the better
our scores will be so be able to
retaliate once J beats our score at the
top right now we have a few other things
here so we've shunt modded the worst
card we have which is the founders
Edition card the FE card pushes about
850 offset on the memory clock and we
need to go and look for Delta clocks
find like a better setting for it but
850 s its max not necessarily the best
and the core only offsets it's a bit
below the EVGA one so the the worst card
is dragging both down because SLI and so
we shut modded the worst card and we can
show some shots of that but we've got
liquid metal on the shunt resistors so
the shunt resistors currently have a bit
of liquid metal on it you should be
careful with this if you put way too
much on there it can one drip off and
short other components and destroy the
PCB or if you put it all over the solder
joints you can actually cause it to fall
off but we only leave it there for
benching so it doesn't really matter for
us clean it off afterwards the better
way to do this would be to piggyback
solder a like three million resistor on
top of the five million resistor but
we've got looking metal on there for an
hour spine so we put that on both of the
shunt resistors and that helped us a bit
with the power target but still kind of
limited on the GPU side so that is where
we got into the CPU overclocking which
fortunately we're using a high wattage
power supply so the 79 80 XC with two
GPUs and all these fans it's and I was
pulling north of a thousand watts for
the whole thing so we have a 1600 watt X
1600 ion there and I'll show you the
BIOS settings to that we used for
getting that top score on 3d mark here
the scores thence recap those we end up
at 14,000 367 after getting some help
before getting help most well actually
pretty much entirely on my own we were
at 14,000 215 ish and then came VIN
jumped into chat and you know all caps
said dude don't tell me you forgot about
the Nvidia control panel settings and
proceeded to explain to us that we
needed to change a few things so this is
I gave Jay all this advice to you so
that it's fair it's still the two of us
against each other without too much too
much puppetmaster eaten by kingpin so
kingpin was in chat for most the stream
was actually a lot of fun and we
appreciate him joining but he did point
out that this slider here which is the
adjust image settings with preview
slider in the Nvidia control panel can
be set to performance instead of
and then the managed to use settings
options globally if you have the 3dmark
program setting set to use the global
settings otherwise use three mark
stand-alone settings and program
settings so the options and here that we
want to change are the power target so
power management mode needs to be in
maximum performance and that just tells
it not to throttle down for any reason
and then also you can set the texture
filtering to be high-performance as well
and so this is still a valid score
within 3dmark doing these things it's
considered normal tweaking it is not
changing the actual benchmark you're not
modifying 3dmark or anything like that
it still falls within fair modifications
so that is fairly significant that
gained us like another couple hundred
maybe another two hundred points in the
graphics core and that mattered quite a
bit for what we were doing overall and
then for the actual scores so we were at
fourteen three sixty seven after that
and that was a fifteen thousand
fifty-three graphics score with a cpu
score of eleven thousand for 22j his
most recent submission and he's been
he's been working on beating our scores
since so it might change by the time
this video goes up his most recent
submission as i'm filming was fourteen
thousand forty three so we passed this
one he's at fourteen thousand eight
eighty four for graphics were bit ahead
there and a decent amount of that is
from that settings change because up
until that point we're about a hundred
points behind him cpa scores at ten
thousand six thirty eight or a bit ahead
of him there as well he called into the
stream and maybe we can drop some of
that call into the the call was because
chat was telling me that J is newest
score 3d mark hall-of-fame went down
because it's we sent too many people
there so went out I couldn't track
people were saying J's newest graphic
score was seventeen thousand points and
I was just like okay there's no way we
can beat that but he called in and to
know their lines either trolling you I
don't believe you so this is where he
sits right now he's having CP
degradation issues we are concerned
about that as well but J is probably
gonna respond he's got some graphics
room where he can beat us there and then
the CPU is where he's gonna have to pick
up most of his points
to really pull ahead but there is we're
still pretty close neck-and-neck right
now for bio settings we have a lot to
improve in the memory tab but on the CPU
tab we're at 48 X for the multiplier I
know for a fact we can push the first
four cores to 49 and still survive and
definitely the first two so that'll gain
us some score even in the graphics
department because one thread is
primarily responsible for rendering and
feeding draw calls to the GPUs so we
push one to 49 that will help these
scores even in the GPU Department so
that's a consideration for us once we
need to retaliate again match ratio we
have a 33 I think and J if I'm wrong
about this feel free to correct me in
the comments if you do see the video but
I think J might have had a lower mesh
ratio than us and that definitely
contributes to the scorer difference to
mesh is a big deal on these 79 ATX
processors then for the rest so we have
extreme voltage mode enabled that we
disabled the Vedra down here VIN B droop
is off extreme voltage mode is on we're
pushing a VIN of 1.95 V core we haven't
only 1.30 right now and go up higher
because cooling supports it so we could
push that higher or you keep it where it
is right now because I've tried at 1.4
with 4.9 gigahertz and it doesn't hold
the mesh we have at one point three
eight this is getting into territory
where we're a bit concerned about
degradation I'd like to be closer to one
point three five but it will not hold
100% of the time if we do that and then
for SI system agent and io voltage we
have one point two those are holding
pretty well and then we have 500 offset
for uncor for memory this is where our
weakest settings are right now and where
we can improve the most so running at
one point six five volts on the dims
they can handle a lot more we can push
one point eight no problem and we've
done it before so we have room to go
there for voltage frequencies 4000 times
we have 15 15 15 28 which is pretty damn
good for this kit of memory we can't get
it down to 14 unfortunately we've tried
everything else currently is auto and in
the past we have used profiles that had
us fine-tuning these so in the past with
the ripple TT stream we had a 15 28 set
of primary timings we did four on our
d6 for our DL and so forth so we tuned
all these which we didn't do last night
because we started experienced a lot of
crashing so this is where we stand right
now while actually the previous setting
was where we stand right now but we have
a few more things we can do to push that
score further so the last thing I wanted
to show that I forgot about is actually
our reservoir and pump mounting solution
which is a block of spare wood two
clamps and then some screws to hold that
in just sort of didn't tip over during
the stream we've got this hooked up to
longer pipes than necessary so that it
can route everything into a nice box we
want to later so that's our next big
move for the motherboard the vrm is
doing fine the X 299 dark has these vrm
fans on it so it runs really well it's
the best cool DRAM in Ex 299 that we've
tested so we might want to add a fan
though just via like a bendable arm or
something over the memory modules
because those start getting hot toward
the end of the stream but they seem fine
I think they're within spec memory can
take a lot of heat so that's the bench
that's the settings everything a lot of
fun on the stream of course our thanks
to Kane pin for joining in and in that
call I passed all that info to Jay and
fairness so he's got it too he can
respond probably beat our score now
we'll see though you can follow jay or
us on Twitter to get updates of this
live he's been tweeting about CPU
degradation and we've been interacting
with him there but otherwise I think
Paul is gonna jump in soon so Paul open
invitation join this battle and - we
already know that you threw in the flag
last time but you know if you feel like
picking it back up by which I mean if
Alex feels like picking it back up then
feel free to join as well otherwise we
were in talks with 10 pin and EVGA about
potentially either us flying out there
or them flying here probably I'd go
there to California and join kingpin and
Jay and maybe Paul or someone else in
EVGA HQ and we can do like a final OC
battle there with with kingpin
overseeing it all because really as we
said in the stream so he says have to
sell homie
that's sad it's actually really sad it's
kind of sad kingpin said it's lonely
half atop
he gets lonely up there where he's so
good now that he's not even part of the
competition
anymore if if he is first we just
consider second place to be first
because it's not fair Robo clocker does
all the work for him these days he just
sits back and watches it go so with the
closed-loop liquid-nitrogen setup how
are we gonna compete and so the way he
decided to stay in the game keep himself
entertained is to on a day after his
birthday no less join in to a four hour
livestream chat and then puppet master
Jay and myself against each other so he
can make his pawns battle each other
because he no longer has anything he
needs to do to win first place and
anything at this point
so a lot of fun doing all that with
everyone thank you for joining and of
course you can subscribe for more go to
store da Gama's nexus net to help us out
directly there because the store
directly supports our live streams and
ability to do them or patreon.com slash
