our own GT X 1080 hybrid because one was
not available at launch so it's a bit of
a an interesting project some of it was
done and sort of get away but it does
work very well and I've got all the
numbers for you so I have everything
from thermals clock right over time and
we've got fan RPMs as well for the erm
blower fan so to quickly recap things
the past two videos went through the
process of me taking this thing apart
and then building it as it is now we had
some casualties along the way but the
original sort of shroud looks like that
and that was over here where that EVGA
part is now and then this was the
original heatsink which we've replaced
with the liquid block from EVGA and
that's a hybrid cooler which originally
shipped on this 980ti hybrid that we
took apart for this purpose so this is
running nine ATI parts which means that
it's not really built for this the
cooler itself is fine it's it's the same
mounting bracket so everything works
just fine there the only thing that
doesn't work is this faceplate from EVGA
this thing does not fit as we showed in
our last video in part two because the
reference design for the outer side of
the founders Edition card is tessellated
in a fashion that these screw holes no
longer line up so we could not use that
but that's purely aesthetic so it
doesn't matter anyway I remounted the
original right side of the cooler for
the founders Edition just to give the
vrm blower fan sort of a pathway to
channel it's err that way can I at least
cool the DRAM the gddr5 X modules but
other than that everything's done under
liquid so we've got that all set up for
testing so I actually think this looks
kind of cool all said and done it's
really suboptimal the way it's built
because you can't get away with this
inside of a case it's just not really
gonna work that well we barely got away
with it in our open air test bench but I
couldn't route the pump the tubes at the
top without removing this part of the
shroud and I really didn't want to do
that because I wanted to direct the erm
airflow so you need that for that
but it looks not bad really overall
considering it's kind of a hack job
speaking of hack jobs here's part of the
hack job this was I don't know if we
even have here's the other half of it
this was part of the outside
embellishments and it's dead now so oops
but let's talk about the numbers we've
got the thermals first so equilibrium
temperatures are that equilibrium as we
call it to make it easy these are the
peak load temperatures averaged for the
cards that you see right now and the new
hybrid the GN hybrid we're calling it
runs at 18.66 Celsius delta T for load
and 1.95 Celsius delta T for idle that's
the GN hybrid then we've got 50 7.51
Celsius delta T load for the founders
edition card or the reference cooler
that's a massive difference and once you
factor in ambient again it gets pretty
close to the 80 plus range which is
where we saw some throttle and we'll
talk about in a moment idle for the
founders edition card at seven point
nine six Celsius and that is a
difference between load and load at
liquid versus air difference of a
hundred and two percent for the cooling
potential for this card so pretty good
numbers there let's look at thermals
over time this presents the data in a
different way as you'll notice the GTX
1080 GN hybrid blows away the
competition and it's got a massive
difference but both of these
temperatures for the founders edition
and logy and hybrid are sort of within
general operability because we're not
overclocked yet so they they do
technically both run just fine and we
need to look elsewhere for where we
would benefit from this crazy
Frankenstein project that we've created
and you don't really need a benefit it's
just fun to do but one of those places
is in overclocking stability and as in
the previous the review we posted you'll
see that the clock rate actually does
sort of fluctuate over time with some of
the temperature increases and so that's
something we explored here as a result
of the liquid added on to this card
liquid gives us a higher Headroom for
OCS higher frequency potential and
that's because the 82 Celsius trigger
the threshold isn't throttling down the
clock rate before we can sustain for a
long period that that overclock if
that's
the major issues is yeah you can create
an overclock on the founders Edition
that's pretty darn high but it might
only be able to hold it for 10 minutes
at a time which is great if you're just
running benchmarks and you don't
endurance test it but if you endurance
test these things like we do then it's
not going to cut it so we run a one to
two hour endurance test which is
reasonable really for review purposes
and this chart shows the clock rate
versus time so this is a pretty
interesting one this is overclock the
GTX 1080 chokes on its thermals and
begins spiralling once it's racked up
heat over a period of an hour long test
and 82 South Seas is that threshold for
thermal reduction for a clock rate
reduction on the GPU pursuant to
thermals you can see that the clock rate
remains stable for good ten plus minutes
but starts choking after that the clock
rate recovers about 15 minutes later and
these dips translate in the real world
to severe screen sort of artifacting
you'll get either artifacts or flickers
or black screens or just frame drops if
it's fluctuating up and down really fast
which it does in the beginning of the
chart it just bounces up and down
between frequencies sometimes the range
is only 60 70 megahertz but that's still
enough to see a reduction in your frame
times and that translates to in-game
performance let's look at the next chart
the first of all the more stable clock
rate on the OSI card the hybrido see the
card is major and allows us to sustain
these higher clock rates but because the
CLC keeps the 1080 below 20 Celsius
delta T which is 40 something when you
factor back in ambient because it keeps
it there we're able to run with a fan
rpm Auto controlled at around 27 to 30
percent for the VR and blower fan and of
course this thing this 120 millimeter
fan does produce its own noise but one
it's able to spin slower anyway because
it's a larger fan so can push more air
and - it's it's really not that bad the
noise is less obnoxious than a VRAM
blower fan fluctuating between 20
something percent and 55 percent which
is what you get with the founders
edition and we don't get that here it
stays perfectly flat at about 27 percent
for the blower fan so that's a good
thing for noise levels now the new
overclock results so originally I was
kind of let down because the founders
edition card only overclocked
two
20 20 megahertz to 20 50 megahertz I had
a range of about 30 and that's because
the frequency and tolerance from
thermals so that's where we were stuck
at before and that's not it's really not
bad but I was disappointed it so our new
overclock we landed at we had a couple
numbers here I'm gonna read them off to
you
maximally we hit 2200 to 2200 to
megahertz infer mark which there's a
disclaimer there in a second
but we had to cheat the voltage away
from the memory so in order to hit that
core clock I basically reduced the
memory clock maximally to negative 500
something megahertz that gave us some
extra voltage to pull away for the core
clock we're able to sustain it infer
mark it did not even come close to being
sustained in games so that is a wash
that's no good we can't really count
that as successful so gamest we're still
crashing because the fluctuation was was
not tolerable to the GPU and then our
final overclock was 2164 megahertz I
think that's a plus to seventy-five
megahertz offset and the memory OSI was
600 megahertz stable and we were able to
actually push 900 megahertz infer mark
but not in games so for games 2164 with
600 OC on the memory not as impressive
at 2202 but a damn lot better than the
2025 ish to 2050 megahertz we had on the
founders edition card so significantly
personally more satisfying overclock of
course but how does it translate into
gaming is the final question here doom
at 4k we see sixty two point three three
FPS versus 59 FPS 1% 0.1% lows are
basically identical that's a five point
five percent difference doom 14 41 11 vs
1:09 a one point eight percent
difference Mordor at 14 41 16 vs 113 a
2.6 percent difference and Mordor at 4k
sixty six point three verse 65 about two
percent difference and then finally GTA
5 at 4k sixty six point three versus 65
FPS again about a two percent difference
so these are BER clocks in terms of real
world gameplay you're not really gaining
a whole lot if you're doing this because
you want to get more FPS spoiler alert
it's
like 1 or 2 FPS and it's not worth your
time at all but that's not why we did it
we did it because the overclock is
sustained better over long periods so we
can run that higher clock we can even
run the the original clock rate we had
better because of that so we have less
fluctuation in the clock overall which
means fewer reductions in frame times or
fewer reductions in frame rate as the
clock stabilizes for thermals means that
the vrm fan runs much slower so it's
quieter the GPU itself is way cooler
useful for a lot of reasons one is
longevity and two is just general heat
in the case or in the system you're
pushing all that heat out here there's
of course heat generation in the and the
wires but you push a lot of it out the
radiator and so that means it's not
getting dumped into your case by another
type of fan so those are all good things
mostly we just I like to seen the inside
of the card and seeing how it builds and
how it breaks
uh-huh so overall fun projects would do
it again would not recommend it if
you're trying to get FPS gains if you
care about noise and thermals it's a
great project to do and but really you
should just wait for of course properly
supported if liquid cooler so you don't
end up with this crazy you know hybrid
of 980ti and 1080 that we did I'm happy
with it though if you like this stuff
comment below we'll try and do more of
these in the future pretty fun lab
projects build type thing but thank you
for watching patreon link in the postal
video if you wanna help us out directly
with future projects like this and I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
