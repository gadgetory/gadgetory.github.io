joined once again by lord british or
richard garriott and today we're talking
about some of your legacy yeah so you
and your team brought a lot of a lot of
innovation to the games industry
especially when it comes to RPGs and
mmos so what was sort of the start of
all of that yeah well the you know of
course these these gray hairs can tell
you that a war if you if you if you
wikipedia it you'll see that I've been
around for about as long as anybody has
been around in this industry you know my
very first games for example like
Calabasas ero in my mind introduced
things like tile graphics the scrolling
taya graphic maps are first in Ultima 3d
perspective line drawn dungeons first
showed up in a calla bath if you go by a
little bit further forward the word
avatar which is now obviously quite
common in our games industry that really
shroud of the avatar and I'm shroud of
the avatar with fact I I wanted to use
the word avatar in shroud of the avatar
specifically to help you know reinforce
that data point that you know prior to
Ultima 4 which was called quest of the
avatar your character in a game was
called your character and and you might
be playing the character of conan the
barbarian with Ultima 4 since it was a
game about virtue I wanted it to be you
in the virtual world since i use the
sanskrit word avatar then you as you
mentioned the term mmorpgs is really
credited to the team and I for Ultima
Online i think i actually get credit on
the internet but i'm not sure it was
actually me but it was somewhere within
the you know myself or star or some of
the other team members that first used
that term was that under origin systems
these rights yeah all everything we
mentioned has been under origin my
brother and i started to form origin in
82 although I think I incorporation
formerly was 83 1983 and of course some
other big names in from origin what
food Warren Spector chris Roberts yep
and there's part of the two but other
biggest names Tony's Rebecca also did
the Crusader series another particularly
popular one but but yeah origin when we
we settled in austin texas we were the
only entertainment software company
within probably a thousand miles and so
if you wanted to be in the games
industry you know that some of the other
early california companies might be too
far away there were a couple people on
the couple companies on the east coast
but if you're in the middle of the
united states or especially if you're in
the southern part of the nited states
everyone came to origin you know which
is how we how we got hold of chris chris
had originally been developing in
England missionaries from and and he
tried to hire our wisp it was
contracting with an artist named Dennis
Liu Bei who did familiar name who did
all of the covers of all Altimas plus a
lot of chris's stuff and and we hired
dennis nube and we said we basically
stole stole dennis from chris who when
he was free lance and so fair for Chris
came over I was going like hey what are
you doing taking my artist and who the
heck are you guys anyway down here in
Austin because his parents were living
in Austin still doing okay and and so we
said look if you want if you want to
work with Dennis just let's all work
together in terms of items you created
or contributed to with the creation
there's a went over avatar previously at
CES talked about the word shard as a pro
games two servers yeah and in fact start
is an interesting one too because you
know I if you go to a database
convention and they talk about keeping
databases duplicated on like the east
coast to the west coast they'll call
them shards but they'll have no idea
that that term comes from Ultima Online
and and the reason why that term exists
that now especially all mmos use that if
they have a copy of the server set you
know I'm on the East Coast are to the
west coast shard when we designed Ultima
Online ea's sales projections for the
lifetime of the product was 30,000 units
and we thought oh that's just way too
low they're wrong it'll be maybe a
hundred thousand and and we said will
you know in case we're wildly successful
we'll build
world that if we had a we sold a million
copies in lifetime will build Britannia
to hold that many people which means you
know concurrently maybe a hundred
thousand people playing or 1010 200,000
people and and then when we had people
sign up for the beta we had way more
people sign up for the beta you know
went 50 within a within a few days
mandame in a week we had like 50,000
people pay us five dollars a piece for
the privilege of being in the beta and
EA an estimate oh my gosh is gonna be
much bigger than we thought we're not
gonna be able fit every in one world and
I actually thought to me that was
disappointing because I was going I want
people to be together and so I didn't
want this fiction where these two worlds
were unrelated to each other and so I
invented the term shards because at the
end of Ultima one mundane the evil
wizard is immortal due to this the
existence of his gym of immortality as
the way you killed him as you first
destroy the gym and break it into shards
and the theory was that upon that
breaking of this super powerful magical
artifact a copy of the world was kept in
each shard you would join one shard I
would join another but maybe someday
we'll reunite the shards and so
therefore really part of the same world
it's very clever in fiction so that's
just an arbitrary word shard but now
it's literally used by all of online
gaming so we've got a charge which have
affected industries outside of gaming
fairly impressive in its alright at
least in terms of terminology avatars
we've got movies in addition to game all
games use avatars now movies now
obviously use the term directly and and
even things like you know tile graphics
up until 3d now has become so easy or
with hardware related you know tile
graphics obviously was also had a 20
year run as a fairly good standard for
role-playing games and so you know and
so first shroud of the avatar I hope
we're going to do it again you know the
camera we have ever talked about this
where we we have a very unique server
model for shroud of the avatar you know
because they didn't want shards I really
do want everybody to be in one
world together and so we have instead of
having a client-server model which is
the way almost all mmos are marketed are
architected we actually distribute the
server into everyone's machine and so
that lets you first of all play solo
player if you wish but it also means
that if the three of us are in and an
instance that is private we can we're
all running the server and so it means
that we only need to check in with a
home office for validation of gold
transactions or deaths or other things
cheating but since we're all three
simultaneously keeping the heartbeat of
the server going if one of us drops out
or their machine blue screens the other
people in the communities keep going so
it's not a like traditional peer-to-peer
where the if the host drops then you're
screwed correct it's more sophisticated
it's more sophisticated in fact you know
as we had been talking about previously
despite this is a completely new type of
architecture we've been launching it
every month for 15 months and it's been
running 24 hours a day seven days a week
for four months and it has never failed
and part of the reason is because it has
to be so fault tolerant you know you
know someone's going to try to hack it
you know someone's machine is just going
to crash and so with the foundation of
the logic of how the servers operate
just has to be able to deal with
something goes wrong and so it's
extremely fault tolerant it's not to say
no individual persons machine has failed
because that has happened but the
service broadly has never had even one
moment of unscheduled downtime
impressive and it for shroud of the
avatar I guess we'll throw a quick plug
in there for that is there a target
release date is their price can they buy
into it now you can't bite it now it's
already on Steam early access or
directly through our website at route of
the avatar calm and any of our backers
can come in and play 24 hours a day
seven days a week will be in alpha by
summer beta by fall and
I'm going up to the the final wipe which
is the closest thing we have to
commercial release hopefully right at
the end of the year we're struggling to
try to make sure we get it into this
calendar year but it'll be close so for
more information as always links in the
description below we shot another video
just prior to this and talking out
shadow the avatar updates so if you're
interested in what you hear here check
that out and we will see you all next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
