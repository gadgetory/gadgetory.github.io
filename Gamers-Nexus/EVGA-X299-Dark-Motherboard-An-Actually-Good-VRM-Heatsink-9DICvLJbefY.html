motherboard and the craziest thing they
did evidently was add a real heatsink
the heatsink has actual fins through
which the heat pipe is routed towards
the IO and into another large aluminum
block which is decidedly less finned but
still thinned the tiny fans on top of
the board look a little silly but we
also found them to be somewhat
unnecessary in most use cases just
having a real heatsink for once gets the
board far enough and also the brilliance
of the PCH fan is that it pushes air
through both the m2 slots and eventually
towards the heatsink near the rear i/o
before we get into that this content is
brought to you by the thermal take flow
RGB closed-loop liquid cooler which is a
360 millimetre radiator plus 3 120 fans
that are RGB illuminated the if then
we'll take it ringing fans at that this
is a 4.5 done a detect pump which is one
of the faster pumps you can learn more
at the link in the description below the
last time we did an X 299 vrm piece was
on the Asus Rampage 6 motherboard the
ram-paige 6 extreme and we found that on
that board it was somewhat easy to cause
it to throttle without direct airflow
directly over the vrm pushed through a
case fan this motherboard has a few
things changed one is again that it's
got actual fins on it and then the other
is that it's got two tiny fans on top of
those now in addition to these is a PCH
fan the PCH does not need direct cooling
at all it barely needs a heatsink on the
chip set however when we took it apart
this fan blows air through the m2 slot
which is a separate story entirely but
once it gets through that slot if you
look at the back of the board there's no
place for the air to exit so it can't go
out here so it's channeled in a way that
the air is forced up into this area of
the board and although it loses a lot of
its pressure at this point because now
you've made a 90-degree turn so you lose
30% of your pressure at least plus the
distance it's traveled even though it's
lost some pressure it's still air flow
going over a small heatsink relative to
this one inside of the i/o shield or the
crowd so these are designs that have
been sorely lacking and motherboards
lately in fact the last really good fend
heatsink like this one that we saw was
probably on an Asus workstation
motherboard from the x99 series so EVGA
survived that look a little bit and it
is actually functional and this board
more or less proves it so the a series
content previously we found that we were
able to get high overclock stable with
direct airflow by putting a fan over the
heatsink they were not stable in fact
they throttled hard when we ran say 4.5
gigahertz at even 1.18 volts and I think
4.3 at 1.15 may have been throttling as
well so that was a problem and these
fats and chokes and everything EB J's
basically got the chokes directly
contacting and the MOSFETs directly
contacting and they have insane
attention to detail the MOSFETs have
individual thermal patch for them rather
than a long strip of the thermal pad
which in strict theory is better but
that's getting pretty granular and
probably into immeasurable differences
still though good attention to detail
now they've left the capacitors exposed
which is fine we did end up putting a
thermocouple on the capacitors we put a
thermocouple on one of the chokes under
the heatsink and we put another one on
one of the MOSFETs under the heatsink so
we're able to take measurements of all
three core components further we ran
tests with and without these fans
disabled and one test with this fan
disabled as well so we're able to see
the kind of impact that the fans have
and whether or not you actually need
them active on the board or at what
point you need them active on the board
just to recap quickly from the ACS
content here's a look at one of the
frequency charts where we were able to
show throttling so this throttling on
the clock occurred because of the choke
and MOSFET temperatures exceeding what
their safety value was set to in the
BIOS let's start with some perspective
looking at the EVGA boards performance
with the vrm component temperatures
between the EVGA SX 299 dark and Asus
Rampage six extreme we've got a chart
that
currently only looks at results when
we're at 4.5 gigahertz with 1.2 0 volts
with these settings the Asus Rampage
motherboard operated at a throttle point
when no direct cooling was added nearing
100 degrees Celsius on our thermocouple
measurements of the chokes and the
MOSFETs keep in mind that these are
external case measurements and that the
internal sensor would read higher
temperatures thus resulting in the
observed throttling we don't know
exactly what the internal temperature is
but that's the trip point adding on 140
millimeter case fan brought it down to
65 degrees which is well within spec
it's it's way better than it ever needs
to be in fact the EVGA x2 99 dark
motherboard operated at 73 to 74 degrees
on the chokes when disconnecting the vrm
heatsink fans
meaning that EVGA is heatsink alone with
zero fans and with no case fans on it is
able to dissipate the heat far better
part of this is a better vrm which has
four more phases than the rampage and
spreads the heat over a wider surface
area the other part is that the heatsink
is fin as a heatsink should be and
similar to the old ACS workstation x99
designs the finned heat sink then
connects via heat pipe to another block
of aluminum where the heat basically is
sitting waiting for the PCH fan to cool
it off or it just slowly dissipates and
exits the i/o shield enabling both the
vrm and PCH fans brought us down to
about 65 degrees on the choke or about
68 on the MOSFET with the uncooled
capacitors at 65 degrees perfectly
within spec once again this is
comparative with the thermal performance
of the Asus board when under a 140
millimeter case fan that's sitting on
top of the VR app now that we've gotten
the comparative data established here's
a look at all of the EVGA X 299 dark
numbers tested at various clocks under
Auto settings the fan follows system
temperature and lands at about 4200 rpm
for which we'll have noise charts in a
moment and the auto fan speeds stick to
around 50 900 to 6300 didn't have your
workload you BGA's vrm fans try to keep
the MOSFETs at around 60 to 65 degrees
from what we can see but this is still
way overkill for vrm temperature
remember these types of components can
take over 100 degrees Celsius
and the vrm heatsink is enough that
we're only ten degrees over its supposed
target of 60 see landing at 73 - so d4c
when both fans are completely
disconnected up to four point five
gigahertz and one point two volts in
open air you could use this board
without the fans active at all they
would help in the case of course but
we'd recommend just running that lower
quieter rpms if you're using a hotter
case and again vrm components can take
125 to 150 degrees Celsius depending
what they are some capacitors are
limited to 105 degrees Celsius but even
if that were the case here which it
isn't
these are running pretty cool thermal
scaling has the four point three
gigahertz and 1.15 volt configuration at
about 55 to 57 degrees with the four
point five gigahertz and one point one
eight volt testing nearing 61 degrees
four point five gigahertz and one point
two four volts which is stressful
intentionally to push the board is
landing at 67 to 70 degrees on core
components or sixty degrees on the
capacitors this was also accompanied by
a fan speed increased to 6300 rpm which
increases our noise to somewhat
noticeable levels plotted over time now
the EVGA x2 99 dark motherboard
gradually increases in temperature
without any fan support but eventually
reaches steady state it does take a long
time to achieve steady-state which
speaks to the mass of the heat sink
the passive dissipation abilities and
the vrm design the 4.5 gigahertz test
with fans unable to reach a steady state
quicker and also keeps the lower
temperatures so what obviously for
comparison here's a chart of just the
MOSFET temperatures between the ACS and
EVGA boards when at the same clocks and
voltages the EVGA board even with its
fans disabled does well to compete
unfortunately EB J's BIOS had time of
testing did not permit voltages below 1
volts so we couldn't test 0.99 2 volts
at 3.9 gigahertz on the EVGA board like
we did for a SUSE and here's the noise
chart the fan tends to stay around 50
900 to 6200 rpm which has us in a range
of thirty four point four to thirty five
point eight DBA of noise and this is
measured at twenty inches of distance of
course it's not just the noise level but
the type of
tiny fans are whiny and that means the
type of noise is more noticeable and
annoying than the lower words of bigger
fans running the fans at 5900 to 6,200
RPM is nearly entirely unnecessary in
our tested configurations though your
CPU cooler and case configuration will
also dictate performance we'd recommend
operating closer to 3300 to 4200 rpm
which measured at 28 DBA to 30 DB a with
a noise floor of 26 TVA in the room the
fans aren't too terribly loud but are
annoying at the top and particularly at
the high end of the rpm scale where we
measured 46 point 3 decibels
that's nearing the noise levels of some
graphics cards that moderate rpm for
load level cooling so this is just a
board we wanted to highlight for doing
something actually sensible for the vrm
heatsink it's a real heatsink you can
tell that EVGA is primarily a GPU or a
video card company because the heatsink
they've stuck on here it's not that
different from the video cards that they
make from the heat things they make for
video cards so they've done well with
that the fans are unnecessary for the
most part you could probably make use of
them in a warmer case for instance
likely the dg7 that EVGA also makes but
the overall execution of this is it's
mixes of brilliant and mixes of
unnecessary brute force I would say this
is unnecessary brute force they're kind
of annoying once they're really spinning
up you will notice it they get whiny but
if you manually control it it'll be fine
evj could do a better job here by tuning
the fan profile on these fans to slow
them down a bit though you have that
ability as well within BIOS you just
change it to either a fixed percentage
or smart mode and then set your
thresholds manually the ones that are
set right now are pretty aggressive
you don't need anywhere near that level
of cooling for open-air and for the
frequencies we test it in voltages this
is pretty smart as well there's a story
behind this that is perhaps worth
exploring later but the short of it is
it cools the m2 device and then it gets
some very tiny often unimpacted
temperature check or airflow through the
extra heat sink over here which is
attached via a heat pipe as far as I'm
cooling don't get too excited about that
you're almost certainly not going to
throttle and I'm too SSD controller and
if you do technically speaking yes the
controller wants to be cold but the
flash actually wants to be warm and by
reducing temperature too much you
technically shorten its life now is it
meaningful
probably not without some serious
cooling or low ambient cooling or
something like that but something to
think about
these are cooling them to devices is
largely marketing at this point but
regardless the fan here that uses a
larger blower fan radial design pushing
air over into that chamber is pretty
good and we like it builds ideas
analyzing this board for us he will have
a separate video with full PCB analysis
and vrm analysis on this channel and
we're going to be doing some quick
memory tests to see if EVGA has fixed
their long-standing problem of poor
memory clock performance on their
motherboards if they have that's a big
deal it has every bit of hardware that
it needs the X 299 dark to approach and
achieve that goal of better memory
clocks we just need to see if it
actually does but as far as the cooling
the heatsink is well designed and it's
sad that we have to explicitly call that
out like this but it deserves it and
hopefully other motherboard makers take
note because you know the argument we
hear is making a heatsink like this
that's finned doesn't look as good I
think it looks pretty damn good and I
know it cools infinitely better then
pretty much every other heatsink on the
market yes like this one this is an EVGA
x99 board that heatsink design is awful
but that has been extended now into
basically every board on the market like
the a C's rampage so there's clearly
there's a lot that can be gained from
this level of density and surface area
and you know if you really want it to
look good motherboard manufacturers you
just put a
sort of plastic cover right on the very
top but leave the rest of it open for
airflow and then you get a mix of it
looks kind of good and it's actually
functional but of course I think
function looks good and that's
subjective anyway so that's all for this
