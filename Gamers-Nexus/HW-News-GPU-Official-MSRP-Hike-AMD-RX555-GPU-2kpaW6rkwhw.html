lots of cool information including some
intrigue surrounding government scrutiny
over meltdown inspector no one saw that
coming and also a couple of news items
on AMD and board partners from Nvidia
and Andy including an official GPU price
increase via MSRP and not just a
retailer increased so we'll be talking
about all that more for this week before
that this video is brought to you by
Thermaltake and the view 71 enclosure
the view 71 is a full tower case that's
capable of fitting three video cards and
most configurations it's also one of the
better cooling cases in our recent case
testing bench lineup the view 71 has
hinged a tempered glass doors on either
side that make it easy to open and show
off and it comes with at least one rain
fan though you can get the RGB version
if you prefer learn more at the link in
the description below this first news
item is pretty straightforward it's an
increase in official MSRP in some video
cards by their respective vendors so
this is something that we'll see
happening more and more over the next
month or so if if GPU prices and memory
prices remain as crazy as they are and
this is also something that we preempted
in our what do video card makers think
of miners part 2 video so in that video
we're talking about how one of the key
contributors to GPU price is not
actually cryptocurrency miners but
rather the price of memory because video
cards of course need memory and it comes
from the same people who make system
memory so keeping that in mind what we
learned was typically a GPU maker would
see a memory volatility price maybe or
price volatility of about five dollars
so if you spend X dollars your memory in
quarter three you might spend X plus 5
or X minus five and quarter 4 and that's
not really enough to adjust the official
MSRP of a card however recently that has
gone from five dollars to twenty to
thirty dollars so we had multiple
vendors tell us this where their cost
not what you pay what they pay to buy
the memory has gone up twenty to thirty
dollars for eight gigabytes of gddr5
which
means that they can't really make much
money so fun behind-the-scenes fact here
if you don't know the type of margins
that a GPU gets by the time you buy the
video card the retailer doesn't get a
whole lot of margin but they certainly
get some of it depending on if they're
gouging right now however the board
partner is somewhere in the four to
eight percent range plus or minus a bit
depending on which card it is and how
advanced it is that's not a lot of
margin a twenty to thirty dollar
increase in your cost to build the
device destroys the margin so
unfortunately some of the vendors are
now increasing their official MSRP which
means it's gonna be offset by retailers
to because they're paying more for the
device as well for their wholesale cost
or whatever it may be so it's
unfortunate however from what we've seen
the when they sell for MSRP it shouldn't
be that much of a hike compared to the
third-party retailers who are hiking it
to to 4x the MSRP so same stuff as
before just be careful who you're buying
it from but yeah that's a that's about
what watch looking like for GPS right
now basically comes down to memory price
increasing next news item is also very
interesting this one comes from Deir
Bauer who is a professional overclock or
overclocked engineer he has his own
YouTube channel and you should subscribe
to him if you haven't because he has
told us that he's got a third video in a
series of looking into epic and thread
Ripper and trying to determine how
closely related those two products are
if you remember a while ago and he put
out a statement saying that the thread
Ripper CPUs do not have what some were
calling dummy dies and we were given the
official terminology for the extra two
pieces of silicon in thread refer we
were told that those are called silicon
substrate interposers so that's what AMD
told us to call the two inactive or
dummy dies in thread Ripper they're
Bauer decided to start digging into that
he wanted to see if the thread Ripper
extra two dies are electrically
connected or not and would be basically
a bend down epoch so if the epic CPU
failed the bidding process if it failed
validation and the yields aren't quite
as good as a.m. these
as they are then potentially you could
turn epic into thread Ripper and end up
with a product that's still sellable so
that's what he's been digging into there
Bauer had two videos so far one is where
he D leads both components and visually
looks at them he was able to identify
that the PCBs are in fact different so
it's not an identical PCB for the two
CPUs there's a difference in for example
an extra resistor or SMD of some kind
and some solder pads that exist on one
product but not the other in the second
video de Brouwer sent the CPUs out to be
x-rayed to look into and these
statements about whether they're
electrically wired or not and what he
found was that they are in fact
electrically connected the extra two
dies and his conclusion was twofold
one option was that AMD is fudging the
yield rate and is using dead silicon on
the threader for CPU however Durbar
noted to us that he doesn't necessarily
believe in this option as being the the
the real one his second conclusion
possibility was that AMD is going to
release this EP with greater than 16
cores for enthusiast desktop which seems
far more likely so that's kind of where
we're at right now the Infinity fabric
does support 32 cores on the thread
river for sockets and interestingly
they're bauer or roman he was able to
test the epic CPU in an asus x 399
motherboard and found that there's an
identification pen in the 4096 pins on
this in the socket tape over the pen and
was able to get all the way up to memory
initialization and boot so it kind of
boots doesn't quite make it but a very
interesting stuff the conclusion here
was that thread of her for and the SP 3
socks for epic had the same pin out and
for the socket and he's got a third
video coming up on Saturday which is
something that he just noted to us and
that will check which ties are active on
his 1920 X and on his epic CPUs so go
subscribe to dare bower if you haven't
because that should be pretty
interesting coming out on Saturday let's
just go through a couple more AMD news
items while we're on the topic this one
we don't have a ton of information on
but Andy has officially
bacterium to some extent if this story
is accurate anyway couldn't really find
an official statement from AMD on it
however we found a statement from the
etherium Enterprise Alliance which is a
collection of fortune 500 companies
I am going to be honest and state that
we don't know a whole lot about the e3
Ameriprise Alliance and their about page
is bereft of information we went to it
it's got about 20 words on it so you
guys work with me here
but basically AMD has allegedly joined
this group alongside over 200 other
member companies of the EEA and the
website for what it's worth does say
that their objective is to quote learn
from and build upon the only smart
contract supporting blockchain currently
running in real world production
etherium to define enterprise grade
software capable of handling the most
complex highly demanding applications at
the speed of business which is of course
second only to the speed of light
so we tell you more but that's really
all that their website says so for what
it's worth it's more if if this is all
accurate it's more indication that AMD
is getting behind blockchain and that
was first shown with their Vega Frontier
Edition rebrand before it was
discontinued were they branded as a
blockchain pioneers card so more news on
that front from AMD will try and keep up
with that one if you know more about the
EEA posted below so that I can educate
myself because their website doesn't
have a lot of good information next one
Microsoft now we're getting to specter
and meltdown stuff so Microsoft has
rolled back the Intel meltdown patches
that were pushed some of these were
causing reboots and other system and
stability issues for users who applied
them Windows has released an update that
quote specifically disables only the
mitigation against CBE
2017 - five seven one five which would
be branch target injection
vulnerabilities and basically that means
it's rolling the patch back this is done
because the reboot bugs that were
causing problems and are associated with
Intel's microcode push Microsoft is
taking most of the blame for that even
though it was an Intel micro code update
Intel recommended a halting deployment
of the current
microcode On January 22nd and Microsoft
has had to rely on Intel for updated
micro code so this is an intel's court
not microsoft's even though they're the
ones who looked the fools for pushing a
patch and then rolling it back i'm sure
they were very happy about that but the
mitigation patch was preventative and
microsoft says that there are no known
reports of this being used in attacks
yet the CBE 5 7 1 5 or meltdown attacks
so if you had the patch it's going away
but also in news for a specter and mouth
on this one is pretty interesting as
well the US government is getting
involved now and oregon congressman Greg
Walden alongside ranking member Frank
pallone from New Jersey issued letters
to Intel arm Microsoft and Amazon and
yet undisclosed companies pertaining to
the secrecy surrounding meltdown and
spectre vulnerabilities for which we
recently published a series of expert
interviews so if you want more
information check out our interviews one
of the letters addresses Apple CEO Tim
Cook directly and this is from those two
congressmen and the letter states while
we acknowledge that critical
vulnerabilities such as these create
challenging trade-offs between
disclosure and secrecy we believe that
this situation has shown the need for
additional scrutiny regarding multi
party coordinated of vulnerability
disclosures therefore and pursuant to
rules 10 and 11 of the United States
House of Representatives we ask that you
respond to the following questions as
soon as possible but no later than
February 7th 2018 the question sent to
cook and others include requests for
information pertaining to the companies
that were involved in proposing the
information embargo on spectra and
meltdown and again to clarify this is
not the kind of embargo with that press
is involved in we had no idea what was
going on this is a special embargo for
software and hardware companies to
ensure that they can secure their
devices prior to anyone knowing
including press and that lifted on in
January early January so other questions
asked for information or analysis on
efforts used to contain and close the
exploits and basically was taken a stab
at the fact that
these the small group of companies
including the five listed were basically
exclusively informed to the point where
you now have small business or
Enterprise IT groups scrambling to
rework their security and and
infrastructure for servers with very
little notice only a few companies
including Amazon had the information
early the fact that Amazon had the
information early means that they
potentially had a business advantage as
they were able to update their services
a bit before some of their competitors
and what this sort of government
scrutiny seems to be looking at so to
borrow a quote from our interview with
GData and some experts on meltdown and
specter enters Fogg said we really need
to have a discussion about ad networks
use of JavaScript and this story is
related to that one this story is about
certain advertisers leveraging the
YouTube ad network not the pre-rolls
that we make but the ads you see before
the videos to use consumer computers to
mine coin hive is being used here it's a
JavaScript cryptocurrency mining
software that can be run in browser and
it can be used to hijack CPU resources
Trend Micro has spotted a 285 percent
increase in coin hi of miners which
alerted them to the problem someone was
distributing coin hi via Google
double-click ads on YouTube or other
websites that run double click ads and
Trend Micro noted that this affected
countries including Japan France Taiwan
Italy and Spain and the best protection
here is to keep your browsers up to date
this is something that we've seen in the
past where websites like the Pirate Bay
have leveraged computer resources of
their visitors to actively mine which is
something that as website owners we
actually strongly disagree with that
idea I would rather serve ads then burn
your GPU at a hundred percent load while
you're visiting the site however not
everyone believes in that so this new
one is violating to be clear Google and
YouTube's Terms of Use for their ad
networks but that doesn't stop
advertisers from pushing through a
malicious ad that violates those terms
it does however get them removed once
Google discovers it so there's a
a figure we have from Trend Micro that
shows the activity of the what they call
malvert izing campaign from January 18th
to 24th and it's it's pretty interesting
data's how basically as anders fogh from
GData said we need to have a look at how
ads are served and secure that this next
one goes back to Andy for a moment and
sapphires so Sapphire created what is
effectively an RX 555 GPU or a slightly
lower tier 560 this is adding to the
confusion surrounding and these low-end
components where you have different Cu
counts there's a little while ago we had
a story about I think it was the 5/6
that one between 14 and 16 to use going
against the initial launch specification
and now the rx 550 is being modified by
sapphire so the spec for the rx 550
low-end GPU which was released to
compete with the 1050 calls for 8
compute units so 8c use and the rx 550
poles from the Sapphire will contain 10
compute units the same amount as the
original no the same amount as one of
the RX 5 60s getting a bit confusing now
so 10 compute units at 64 stream
processors for compute unit per M these
architecture but you had 640 streaming
processors as opposed to the original
512 stream processors so quite a big
difference there actually in performance
potential and AMD's specification
website we checked it just to make sure
that website lists the compute unit
count for every other card that they
make that we could see from the RX 500
series except for the rx 550 so there's
no official documentation on their
current version of the website that says
whether it should be 8 or 10 to use it's
just left blank
but either way Sapphire is creating an
rx 550 that will have 10c use so just
like you have to do with the 5 60s now
where some of them are basically four
sixties that have been rebranded you'll
need to look carefully at the five
fences you're buying because if someone
reviews the pulse-width tends to use
that performance will not be the same as
one of the cards with 8 CS just be aware
of what you're buying make sure you read
the description pages it's not as simple
as just the name of the
anymore next news item is on hardware
info hardware info 64 is one of the best
logging utilities we certainly recommend
using it it's a software utility and
they just released an update that listed
unreleased and the products in their
update notes for supporting those
products in logging activities and this
included quote enhanced support of AMD's
starship Matisse and Radeon rx Vega M
GPUs matisse is theoretically the
desktop send to component and starship
is potentially according to video cards
a 48 Core 96 thread processor and that's
based on an old road map that video
cards obtained so grain of salt with
that one but hardware info has since
amended their update to read simply
enhanced support of AMD Radeon rx Vega
am removing the Matisse and starship
notes so it seems like that's been
modified prayer requests I'm sure but
either way it gives us a bit of info as
what's coming out and when and then a
couple of small site news items here
we've been tasking dragon ball fighter z
deal with it her performance and we'll
have an article on the website with
graphs of a dragon ball fighter Z's
performance in terms of the frame rate
and if it operates at sixty or thirty
and when it operates at thirty and so
forth it was part of our ongoing efforts
to expand and iterate on our console
testing methodology the game does not
really deserve a video it's pretty
straightforward but we're gonna put out
an article and then we use the game to
further advance our software free
consultation which will allow us to do
more console versus PC comparisons in
the future the very short summary of
this is that it's a sell shader
cel-shaded fighting game it's not really
that Hardware intensive some of the
animations appear to be hand drawn or
handcrafted via software and those
animations run at 30 fps or less and
then the game is about 60 FPS almost
100% of the time with a couple of drops
every now and then so we've got tests on
that and we'll publish that on the
website very soon that gamers nexus net
next is a new series so we're doing
videos that we are using a working title
of bench theory for where they are
basically
behind-the-scenes deep dives of what
research goes into our benchmarking
methodology we are revising our bench
methodology for GPU CP is pretty much
everything this year for 2018 this is
something we do every year around this
time and as such it's a good time now to
provide some extra information on what
we did for the last year because a lot
of it we do make public but some stuff
we keep behind closed doors until we
advance our own testing for competitive
reasons obviously however because we're
changing everything it's a good time to
put it out so I keep an eye out for a
bench Theory series we have a couple
coming up one of them that should be
live when this goes up is a look at
benchmark duration ie 30 seconds 1
minute 90 seconds 5 minutes how much is
enough and when do you need to change
those intervals and we all we're also
looking at the standard deviation run to
run and test variance between different
games to determine how accurate are the
games which then helps us know how many
times we need to run a test for averages
to be actually accurate for example if
you have a lot of variants standard
deviation of 10 FPS 4.1 or something low
as you probably need to run the test
more times or it's just a highly
variable game and if that's the case
need to make a note of that in the
content so we have all that coming soon
