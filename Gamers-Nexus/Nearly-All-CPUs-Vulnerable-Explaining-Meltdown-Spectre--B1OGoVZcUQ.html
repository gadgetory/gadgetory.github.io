several tweets messages and emails about
one topic in rapid succession and that
topic is the new Intel and potentially
AMD an armed security vulnerability
that's been discussed on the Internet
this would be pertaining to specter and
meltdown two new attacks that can be
used to gain access to information on
your computer these topics enter areas
where I am personally not an expert I am
NOT knowledgeable enough on them to
provide an opinionated response and a
lot of you wanted that when tweeting at
us so what we did instead is some
research we looked around a lot dug up
all the information we could on these
topics and we've put together a piece
that should hopefully give you
information on what this vulnerability
is from a non opinionated standpoint
just strict facts about everything and
how it impacts you what the next steps
are for the companies involved and the
discussion on performance so the point
here is to look at this completely
factually and journalistically and avoid
opinions because again it's not really
what we do but we can do research and we
do know a technology a bit so hopefully
this helps you out with understanding
what all of this is before we get into
that this content is brought to you by
the Thermaltake flow RGB closed-loop
liquid cooler which is a 360 millimetre
radiator plus 3 120 fans that are RGB
illuminated if then we'll take it ringg
fans at that this is a 4.5 done a stack
pump which is one of the faster pumps
you can learn more at the link in the
description below the shortest version
of the issue is this Linux and windows
operating systems are undergoing major
reworks to cope with security
vulnerabilities that are present on the
last 10 years worth of Intel CPUs with
Spectre exploits discovered on AMD arm
and Intel CPUs alike everyone is
affected and at least some capacity but
the exploits affecting each vendor vary
the hardware itself isn't insecure or
physically compromised but it requires
software changes to close security holes
that are present the concern from the
community has been how these security
holes will change the performance
because as we close those initial
reports from gr secure
indicated between 5% and 29% performance
deficit and note that the commonly cited
29% number was derived from a 6700 test
bench with page table isolation one of
the proposed hardening techniques for
increasing security this was found with
our ap or rap Linux benchmarks and the
number is not a blanket number for all
performance changes but we'll get to
that momentarily
what is the vulnerability though project
zero a Google team reported that there
is a system call issue with the kernel
which could lead to security
vulnerabilities when a virtual memory
allocation is read projects a zero
reported this issue to not only Intel
but also AMD an arm back in June of 2017
there are two separate attacks that have
been developed around this security
vulnerability and they are codenamed
meltdown and specter meltdown is a
breakout attack this means it's capable
of exiting the confines of virtual
environments and spectre is a
speculation execution attack meltdown is
the worst of the two attacks and is
known presently to affect Intel with
indeterminate effect on Andy and arm the
team is still researching and Spectre
does affect Intel Andy and arm alike but
we'll see about meltdown both attacks
are capable of intercepting user data
that is currently being read
particularly when involving virtual
memory allocation these attacks give
access to data stored in memory which
could include passwords usernames and
other transactions that are being
actively moved between memory and the
CPU this is particularly concerning from
an enterprise or service standpoint as
one of the attacks leverages at branch
prediction exploits too as a KVM guest
read the memory of the host kernel this
has severe implications for virtual
machine users primarily those who may
slice servers into multiple virtualized
environments for customer use meltdown
for example is capable of granting an
attacker full access or control over the
contents of physical memory on the
machine and that breaks the boundaries
of virtual machines project zero notes
that the meltdown quote
brakes the mechanism that keeps
applications from accessing arbitrary
system memory and that quote Specter
tricks other applications into accessing
arbitrary memory locations in their
memory stating further that both attacks
use side-channel attacks to obtain
information from the accessed memory
location the researchers at behind
meltdown inspector have published papers
on these exploits and have also
published an FAQ for consumers the very
first question am i affected by the bug
the answer is equally simple most
certainly yes the researchers note that
we meltdown exploit has worked on Intel
CPUs dating back to 2011 and they've
also noted that they are not yet clear
on whether meltdown
explicitly works on arm or AMD
processors when we asked Intel for a
statement we were sent this page where
the company alleges that these exploits
may also affect Andy and arm
we've asked AMD for a statement
countering this but we are currently in
a holding pattern Andy did however
publish its own a short note about these
exploits as of now Andy isn't mostly
noting that they're aware of the
vulnerabilities and that the company is
investigating further critically Andy
notes that they do not think these
exploits have been used in the public
domain
though the meltdown researchers say that
they are uncertain whether meltdown or
meltdown like attacks have been deployed
publicly so we're not fully sure yet as
for the specter attack the team notes
that this exploit has been verified on
Intel Andy and ARM processors and notes
that it will work against nearly every
type of computer including smartphones
and cloud servers Google by the way has
confirmed that Android is affected and
has issued a security advisory about the
attack Intel issued a statement
finally and Andy issued its own short
news item neither of the latter have had
much information while google has
published some of the most detail on the
subject if you're interested in further
reading check out what project 0 wrote
so then why did this happen at all to
begin with the meltdown white paper
indicates a root cause being branch
prediction on the cpu's particularly
speculative
branch prediction the foundation for
spectres name speculative prediction is
something we have talked about before
primarily with GPU architectures branch
prediction is the goal of the CPU or GPU
to execute commands before those
commands are ever issued the idea is to
reduce wait time maybe the command never
comes and so the work is wasted but the
potential upside is worth it as the
pipeline is sped up and tasks can
execute with lower latency and in this
instance of the attack some data can get
left behind in l1 cache which should be
protected data but the exploit is able
to gain access to that orphaned
information giving attackers access to
potentially sensitive data like
passwords or usernames Specter is
interesting this one is able to attack
user space in virtual machines the white
paper details an example where Java
Script code running inside of a Google
Chrome browser could be leveraged to
read data sent through Chrome like
reading a field from inputs on websites
this attack can be deployed through
JavaScript downloads and as we
understand it this could mean that an ad
network compromised for example could
have disastrous effect this has already
been tested as successful by the way on
the Chrome browser and could
theoretically work on other browsers so
it's not just hypothetical this works as
an attack this issue doesn't come down
to just sacrificing security for sake of
speed either kernel level security would
indicate that memory should be protected
by other models like address space
layout randomization GN patreon backer
Steve straizo was able to provide a
great example of this and quoting Steve
with address space layout randomization
or ASLR it's basically real inking a
program at random locations at launch
time you can't just say give me the
memory at zero by de adb EEF because I
know that the users password is there as
well as kernel ASLR or a KS lr which
does the same thing but for kernel
memory since the kernels memory isn't
protected any more it can be read at
will by the attacker it's not a speed
versus security thing the security was
supposed to happen elsewhere what
happens now
I expect a large dump of information on
January 9th this is when the embargo
lifts on everything that's been kept
behind doors so far this will be the
next major milestone for us and we point
at which the general consumer and in our
community we should be able to obtain a
better understanding of what's going on
and if it changes the way pcs perform
the most immediate steps are being taken
by the hardware and software
manufacturers with Microsoft
fast-tracking updates to Windows for
security this is a software level
solution as the hardware itself is not
physically compromised if you own
affected CPUs and you do even if
specters affecting AMD you can expect
software level patches to help resolve
some of these concerns arm has already
developed software solutions that can
mitigate the effect of Spectre
specifically Linux kernel virtual memory
systems are already being overhauled and
Microsoft is working toward a January
9th patch and has already issued
improvements to the fast-track or fast
train users the question is whether or
not any of these fixes will impact
performance negatively that's the big
concern
so then performance claims early claims
by gr security have gone through a game
of telephone at this point initial
reports showed potential for 5% to 30%
performance deficit in some specific
tasks with different tasks suffering in
different ways the performance loss
comes by the way of introducing more
latency done by nature of adding more
layers of security what this does not
mean however is that every CPU in every
application will instantly be 30% slower
most of the major performance slowdowns
have been reported with enterprise level
software not necessarily consumer level
software for onyx for instance has
already published some preliminary
gaming benchmarks on Linux and they have
shown a performance deficit that is
largely within margin of error this is
only one operating system of course with
only a few games so there's room for
other games OS Azure CPUs to be impacted
in greater ways but for now it doesn't
look too bad for gaming what we're most
curious about though is the impact to
workstation and for
type applications these straddle a line
between consumer and enterprise uses and
we're unclear of the performance losses
and whether they can be mitigated with
more time for example of these panicked
fixes were just thrown together quickly
there may be better solutions later this
isn't to downplay the significance of
the exploit nor the significance of lost
performance but to restore some sanity
to the discussion when citing numbers
for example 30% performance loss it's
important to know where they come from
and if they impact the implications
you're talking about in that context
we're waiting on further performance
testing at this point and we'll have to
see how that goes with CES going on as
well because right now we've got CES to
worry about as does everyone else and
the patch publicly will launch on
january 9th which is when CES is
basically starting so that's nice gifts
from Microsoft and everyone else in the
community we will be talking with
vendors at CES about this performance
concern or these security concerns in
general and we'll just have to update
from there until that time though we're
gonna do our best to stay on top of the
story you can get faster and updates to
Windows and do some preliminary testing
we might but it's just a question of if
we have time before the flight and we
probably don't but we'll try and in the
meantime don't be too concerned because
there's not a lot you can do anyway and
just see what happens with the patch if
you do want to use the faster an update
though of course be aware that there are
some stability concerns with any early
deployments of a patch or OS and it's
just a matter of how much you think or
how likely you think you are to be
affected by this bug Intel statements
thus far have left a lot to be desired
they are not responding in a way that
that really reveals information that
could be useful in determining what
specifically they plan to do in the
future to resolve this and tailed it a
big statement saying they're gonna be
more aggressive in the future so this
would be a good time Intel to show us
what you mean by that
Andy has issued a brief it's not really
a statement but just just a brief really
short quote that they are aware of
vulnerabilities and they're researching
them we've been in contact with both
companies we did not receive more from
Intel than the statement they've already
publicly posted andy is they basically
have us in a holding pattern and we'll
update everyone via the website gamers
nexus net which will link below if they
do provide more information for us but
that's all for now
hopefully this type of video worked out
for you because as stated it's not
really our core expertise so it came
down to researching and compiling
everything to just provide a facts only
overview of it and hopefully we did an
okay job of that for you
