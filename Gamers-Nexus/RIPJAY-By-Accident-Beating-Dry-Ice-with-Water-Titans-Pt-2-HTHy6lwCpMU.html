extreme overclocking rig except it's not
it's not using that exotic of a cooling
solution we're using a giant 78 quart
ice bucket and we're insulating
everything differences this time I'm
insulating it better
well I school everything so the cpu
included not just the GPUs and we have
these Titan RT X's that are under 20 80
TI water blocks to this in part one
these will also be sub ambient cooling
so pretty excited about the the
performance there and the goal is to see
how high up the leaderboard we can get
for overclocking referring back to the
RIP J series but J went with dry ice I I
really want to see if we can get close
to his score without dry ice just by
using a 90 90 d XE and to tighten our t
axis just just like $7000 of hardware
basically because he was on a 79 80 XC
and 220 ATT ice which is what we used
originally then he had a dry ice we're
gonna see if we can get up to where he
is just by using the refreshes of the
hardware and slightly unlocked Titan RT
X and we already did some board
insulation in part one as well with the
kneadable eraser and shop towel
everywhere so now in part two we're
gonna do two browning and finalizing
some of the configuration for the
hardware side of things before we start
considering BIOS and software settings
and most of that will likely be in the
live streams before that this video is
brought to you by the gigabyte z 390 ARS
master motherboard which comes equipped
with one of the more powerful Z 390 VRMs
for heavier overclocks on the new 9th
gen intel cpus the ARS master is also
one of the few motherboards with a real
heatsink this generation featuring a mix
of high surface area fins and looks
oriented cover blocks oh and it's also
got updated our DV illumination
learn more at the link below okay so
we're just gonna cut this together
really quickly where we're gonna
insulate the back of these it's
something you already saw in part 1 it's
going to keep it short
I am the point of this insulation is to
block air from hitting the card and
forming condensation because the front
of the card the cooler will be below
ambient that will form condensation on
the back and we just need to be careful
about that look
metal so that's the the biggest concern
here all right so that's gonna cut down
a lot but that took like 20 minutes or
something it's pretty pretty meticulous
so we've got some kneadable eraser on
there
I left the area with the shunt resistor
that's got liquid metal on it exposed so
I can easily access it one problem is if
you put too much liquid metal on and I
did put a lot on this time I don't wanna
do much less than this maybe do too much
then it'll just trip and protection and
you'll be like 35 megahertz so I left
that exposed that way if it is too much
we can remove it and if you do too
little it just it doesn't change
anything
so hopefully this is a good middle
ground where we get boosted power target
by tricking the circuit into thinking
we're drawing less power than we are
without breaking it and it's not a
permanent break you just remove it
you're good so it's not a big risk I
should know that liquid metal on cards
isn't a great idea for long-term use
period but it's fine for what we're
doing which is competitive benchmarking
so now we need to figure out the tube
length of everything
that means starting to install the
actual test bench itself oh yeah we can
do that actually I have to take all the
fans off of this to moderately
successful removal of everything we have
a pile of mounting hardware in the
bottom of the radiator so this is the
Mora 360 rad or no it's the more a three
rad and it has it had four 200 fans on
the front and it can fit nine 140 s on
each side so we had four 140 s on the
back for 200 on the front before
realizing that's enough
don't need more than this this was for
the previous project still connected to
the fan controller and all of that's
taken off now including the special
bracket for the 200s and now we just
need to prepare to submerge it in the in
the tank and the ice tank we also have a
pile of screws so if you ever need some
200 mil or some some screws for all the
200 fans we've got them this mounting
rail kit
also comes off there so we never showed
this process when we did the build the
first time but it's got these two rails
that go on to provide screw points in
the middle of the radiator and then
that's used for like the 140s or the
120s or whatever you may use and then
the 200 to use the the big one but we
only had one of those for the front so
because I got to get those the mounting
hardware out of there and then we can
start preparing to submerge it the water
cool maura 3 is is fun for everyone it's
fun for the whole team and now it's time
to transplant it I think into a into the
bucket to start planning that phase so
I'm gonna move it and then get the the
bench here let's start building that out
run all the tubes and figure out the
loop order that's gonna be the big thing
to do I always have to think through
that kind of before really committing to
it because there's a lot of stuff going
on in the in the loop so we need the
bucket this has been here since the last
stream that's a 540 radiator if you
didn't see that one it has a bunch of ek
Furious fans which are insane 2500 rpm
we still have some insulation on the CPU
loop and the cooler is covered in debris
from the ceiling tile from when we were
doing some electrical work so it's time
for this to come out I guess it's still
still got water in it I need your
assistance can you hold this for a
second ok thanks
yeah let's elevate it just to get this
high enough that I can empty it into the
bucket later oh that's pretty stable I
guess I should take the feet off of this
too let's see how this fits oh yeah this
so this thing I just remembered as I was
I almost came into contact with the fins
these fins are absurdly sharp like I
sliced my fingers open I was working on
this the first time and it it was not
pretty so really sharp if you do happen
to buy one just be aware of that I think
I need to put it in like this so the
tubes are up and I'm trying to keep my
fingers clear of the fins that's pretty
good we'll have 60% coverage and then I
can just like suction cup pumped a pond
pump to the wall behind it and then
that'll circulate water through it so
one of the big things here is keeping
water moving to get the warm water away
from it and we'll do that by sticking a
pond pump in there still on loan from
Ritchie and our patreon tide need to
send that back to him I don't know if I
can get this more submerged than that
really I mean like maybe I guess I can
do this that would get us a little more
submerged Oh a couple things I should
update everyone on this so after the
whole ripped Jay everything was done
last time after Jays last response we
have that review cycle for a whole bunch
of products and part of that review
cycle involved me removing the lid again
from the 79 80 XE
for testing against the 9090 DXE which
was not publicly out yet or announced
and in the process of doing that this is
after Jai's response
I removed the lid and reapplied it and
then the the temperatures for testing
dropped significantly so what had
happened was in doing the extreme
testing versus Jai somewhere along the
line moving the CPU around the lid got
got kind of pushed the jar enough now
this was never in any of our official
testing or reviews or anything like that
it was just in the rip J competition but
I got pushed around enough that the the
thermals were significantly higher than
what they should have been so for the
GPUs in the ice bucket they did great
the CPU was way higher like I mean it
was some of the cores weren't really
contacting the IHS properly which
resulted in in the IHS well I mean it
resulted in basically lower clocks than
we could have gotten so realizing that
we had a bit more room left in the CPU I
think I did not know that we were so
thermally constrained because I didn't
think to really check so okay well this
is good for that it's only one radiator
it is quite large but it's the only one
radiator so I don't I don't know I'm
thinking loop order is GPUs they're the
most thermally dependent and then the
CPU my concern is that the GPUs are
going to be limited by the v bios and i
don't know what to do about that yet
that's gonna have biggest limitation
right now so it'll be reservoir water it
goes down it goes into the inlet on the
dual DDC pump there's an EK dual pump
comes out and the dual pump is kind of
necessary for how much how far we're
going to be pushing this liquid comes
out goes into the radiator so it is now
the coldest that can possibly be so at
this point it should go directly to a
component and that's gonna be with this
into a GPU and then that GPU will go
into the second GPU in the middle of the
board so this tube will go to a GPU here
that GPU will go to this GPU and I don't
think I have a terminal to connect them
I think we'll just run a loop and then
that'll go into the CPU and then the CPU
will exit and go into the bottom of the
reservoir with this hanging thing so I
don't need I don't need much to connect
those and then then it will loop so
that's going to be our loop
I think the bench probably positioned
about here give us the most space for a
monitor during a live stream something
like that yes I probably want access no
give it back I upon access to the button
so I'll keep this probably oriented like
that all right so then this will connect
back into the radiator and I don't think
I even need to retube anything for that
or into the reservoir I may not read
either so those would hook up there I
don't I haven't really checked the
performance on they used to see what
your overclocks better I did it
overclocked them but I didn't test them
versus each other and I need more
extreme scenarios so that will go there
and have to disable that fan down there
I think I can do that in BIOS though
that PCH fan that's gonna create airflow
that I really don't want anywhere close
to video cards but I'm pretty confident
I can disable that in in BIOS the cool
thing of this radiator is that it runs
cold enough without any fans that
without even ice I can boot it get into
BIOS and change whatever I want and it's
not going to overheat for a while so
okay
just in case I accidentally do turn this
fan on at some point I'm gonna block its
its exhaust so this fan there's another
piece that goes here typically it's a
plastic piece we currently have it
removed and the fan will push the air
down that funnel and down this this
chamber down here and it exhausts back
here somewhere
it's meant to go out this way out of the
i/o so I'm just gonna obstruct it just
in case I mean my plan is to disable the
fan but just in case I'm in a live
stream and I some reason said all the
fans to max will be covered sockets
itself that coppers so so heavy this is
an interest in water block I'm really
curious to see how it performs okay so
we'll use these slots for clearance make
sure I have a bridge that'll reach that
gap yes okay cool
help
it got me
I can't leave now I don't know if these
would be significantly improved with the
real envy link bridge like the actual
super expensive one with full bandwidth
and resource sharing and all that stuff
I don't know that that really matters
for this kind of test where that's even
supported in time spy okay
so Wow so water comes out here go into
one of these all right I need to see
what parts we have I don't know what
liquid cooling parts we have so check if
I know we have a lot of fittings and
stuff like that I just need to check if
we have terminals we have been of
miscellaneous alpha cool stuff we have
liquid cooling fittings plenty of those
from all brands Xbox 360 cooler no
thanks none of these are gonna be good
bridge GPU clean parts GPX upgrade kit
wow that's that's sunblock hmm okay now
okay nothing here so I gotta check a
different shelf GPU dual link that's
interest that's that's promising let's
see if this will fit yes if it doesn't I
will probably regret not using two ek
blocks instead
this is from water cool okay I got it
mixed up I brought out a threader if it
thing you're not gonna use so there's
our water cool bridge that would also
need to be completely wrapped in paper
towels but then that would make my life
a lot easier
yeah if it fit and it's not going to do
that I'm being told by Ritchie c77 we
just had part one of this live and he he
helped me with this with some of the
parts sourcing for water cooling parts
when we did our first round of this cuz
Jays got a massive inventory of it and I
didn't and he just messaged me after
seeing our first part of the video
shout out to Ritchie c77 he's on the
leaderboard - he says dice for Jay dry
ice for Jay was more based on an
experience so he's he's more or less
saying that it's worth trying just be
careful with it the first time trying it
out and that chilled water and full
coverage can be tricky to deal with for
condensation that will build on the
backside of the block which I am aware
of but also not positive how to solve
sort of just blocking every possible
entrance for air so I probably need to
go over this these some more with with
paper towel but will will go ahead and
finish the loop planning before I do
that but this thing that I stopped to
look up in the first place let's see the
necessary stereo plug is not included
GPX to link covers
okay so covers all common configurations
of two or three video cards okay one
cover bridge to close the unused slots I
see okay so we're not gonna be able do
anything with that which means I'm just
gonna run tubes for all of this
so asking Ricci see for his thoughts on
how I can best use a full-coverage
blocks like this because previously
previously I just used the supremacy
block and that was pretty easy because I
it's one block and I just kind of
covered everything around the block with
paper towel but now we have this whole
full coverage block and there's contact
obviously everywhere on the card some
stuffs not flush contacting so
condensation could form there so it
might be easier to go with the supremacy
blocks but we'll see I would really
prefer not to these fittings have been
extremely useful
what are these even called I don't know
ek hfb fittings I've just I've liked
working with these they are easy to
install and remove and it's pretty cool
actually this one doesn't fit but you
just stick an allen key in there I don't
know if it's I guess a 10 millimeter
allen key and then you can tighten it
like that so these have been great to
work with I think I probably want a
right-angle one on one side of the card
though so he's got a good point here
Ritchie says that blocking off
everything blocking off everything to
the card like all possible entrances for
air should stop a condensation whatever
air is left inside of it will condense
so that's a point of concern but he does
say it's a minor amount and then he says
he ran the titan v with a full block and
all of the exposed areas had
condensation on them so maybe let's I
don't know if he did I think
the chilled water I think you did what
we're doing so we just need to be
careful with making sure nothing's
really exposed alright cool so I'm
getting a bit more confidence as I talk
with Ritchie our our patreon backer who
happens to have some some top 10 extreme
OC experience recently getting more
confidence that this is is not going to
be terrible as long as I just block
everything with a shop towel and we I'm
just going to finish installing the
fittings and stuff and then we'll go
ahead and do that so this we're gonna
have water in and then out here in that
should be a rotated one as well
that's good and then loop alright sweet
that's gonna be pretty nice so I don't
want to use this one that one's got a
problem so it's gonna be tube straight
into here both sides so basically the
loops gonna come over from over there
out of the big radiator quick disconnect
just to make things easier it it impedes
flow a bit but we should be fine so QDC
and then tube with QDC straight into
there so this will be the first card
first device in the loop and then exit
and then go straight into there and then
exit and I'll disconnect this one and
just strap it straight there and I
should probably do a cutie see there as
well otherwise not gonna be able
disguise clip so probably do a small
really is really small loop right or
cutie see right there that goes into the
CPU CPU connects to the reservoir the
reservoir exits and goes into the dual
DDC and then the dual DDC goes into the
radiator on the other side and we'll
have a pond pump for the rest think that
covers the the idea here the concept so
now I just need to to tape the rest of
these up and make sure I'm covered on
the condensation front so that's that'll
take a little while but will will burn
through that pretty quickly in the
editing at least okay so we're leaving
for CES tomorrow or today depending when
the video goes live and we don't have a
ton of time here but we have enough time
do one quick test with the RIP J system
ji I understand he responded I don't
know I don't watch his videos but I
think he responded and I think he did a
single GPU test so he J you're pulling a
Linus it's what you're doing right now
you're you're winning the wrong
benchmark you're in the race too no one
else is in so we've got two GPUs set up
which is still what we're doing and
bucket of ice salt in it and my goal is
again to beat J's dry ice score from
previously his Allen T score doesn't
apply because he didn't do it with two
cards so we were still competing against
a dry ice score without dry ice and if
we can beat that that'll be the cool
part we've upped it to tighten our t
axis though and this took long enough
that we got our new the old mugs in in
the time we were working on everything
but we'll have that on the store on
store that game is X its Donna if you do
want to check those out separately so a
test bench really quickly cuz I want to
be done so we can fly more a three
radiator in the ice bucket ice salt on
the ice to lower the freezing point to
about negative eight degrees Celsius we
have closed it a little bit but we have
a pond pump in there close it when we
can to keep some of the cool air down
Dooley to see smallish reservoir dual
Titan our T axis everything is insulated
like crazy and then we had briefly two
power supplies hooked up I've cut it
back to just one and that originally was
so that we could run them on two
separate circuits so that we could
ensure there was no V droop in the line
okay so there's a we're running off one
power supply now which has been
sufficient having an issue where I'm
getting a shutdown at 1.5 volts and it
seems like OCP but I've tried two
different power supplies and it still
does it so not sure what that is but we
can still beat the score without 1.5
volts even though it would be nice to
have that so we get five point three
gigahertz all core we're still at 5.1
5.2 so let's run a couple benchmarks and
then get on a plane so I can go see J in
person okay so we just booted it up and
it currently has similar settings I've
just pushed it to 51 all core but it has
the same settings as our previous 99 80
XE livestream and we're at 33 mesh 51
all core 1.95 just put it to one point
for two bolts for V core so this is
basically the not currently trying
profile it's the let's make sure it's
stable profile we're at 3800 megahertz
so all we're doing is just seeing if
this thing actually will run presently
because well it's freshly assembled so
that's the first test okay so I haven't
really stability tested these to see
where like I know where one of them
performs based on the review but we're
just going to conscience some numbers
that are probably stable and see where
that gets us and then 11 20 memory 170
offset core max power not gonna do any
hotkeys or any of that this time stone
don't really feel like it right now
we've cut travel immediately so let's
see what our baseline is with these
settings might as well close gpu-z
I'll check the temperature okay GP is
kind of hot 10 degrees right now our
target it's normally about 8 and CPU is
at 19 so okay well first test pass is
done J's 2 cents fifteen thousand four
hundred fifteen thousand four hundred
fifty five dual GPU
and we just did 15,000 826 without
trying before getting on a plane dare
Bowers at 16,000 248 and I'm sure he
hasn't tried in several months but with
more time we can potentially catch up to
dare Bower but I'll take that 170
megahertz offset core 1120 memory your
move Jay I guess it's kind of a lot of
work to do one test so if you could like
do something that'd be good so Jays Jays
moved on to ellentube for single GPU
because his to tighten RT axes are tied
up in a pretty build he's making so I
don't know hopefully Jay breaks out the
Titan RT access to do do some real work
see some benchmarking and and comes back
after CES but for now in the very least
we've knocked them down the dual GPU
charts will probably do some live
streams after CES at some point within
maybe two weeks of coming back from CES
so keep an eye out for that
but for now you got to see a pretty cool
overclocking setup that was used once
and we're gonna go get on a plane thank
you for watching subscribe for more you
can go to store like Aaron's access net
to pick up something like the new copper
meal mug which is hopefully up there by
