beat X 2019 this one's going to be a
little bit rough and not for me we'll
start with the good stuff so this is a
new pump design it's a dual chamber pump
this comes after some of the concerns
about like the tr4 pump and corrosion
which I did talk to them about that so I
have some news on why that was happening
and how I know max thinks they have
fixed it
we'll also be talking about some cases
that could use a little bit of work and
and then well yeah let's let's start
with a good thing though before that
this video is brought to you by thermal
takes ring duo 12 radiator fans the
reading duo 12 fan kit comes with three
a RGB 120mm fans with a controller and
each fan equipped with 18 LEDs and a
diffuser for a glowing color inside of
the fan rain with fluid color changes
when cycling through the color spectrum
the fans are made for use on radiators
and use hydraulic bearings for long
lifespan rated at 40,000 hours for the
fan the fans have an RPM range of 500 to
1500 giving the ability to quiet down
the fans under low load or boost them
for heavy workloads the ring duo a 12s
are available now learn more at the link
in the description below so the pump
this is a new design they're trying to
get a patent on it or maybe already
patented dual chamber pretty
straightforward so plain English it's
got two chambers the inlet as
illustrated by this giant cross-section
which is actually pretty sweet and
really appreciate them doing this inlets
over here it drops in sort of towards by
this illustration it drops in like at
the outer edge of the cold plate by that
one it drops in in the center they've
told me the center so I think maybe the
cross section is the inaccurate bit but
either way in theory the water supposed
to come down the middle somehow I think
it drops in here and like hits the upper
chamber and then flows over and then
drops down this hole there's a hole in
the cross-section in the middle so
chamber one flows then falls down to the
micro fins and then chamber two is the
top part so you've got the electromagnet
of and motor of the actual pump up top
and then underneath it is where the
impeller sits so that would be the
obviously the spinning bit see yeah new
pump design it's already on the aqua
fusion so they have 120 to 240 here
supposed to be on the lick tech to I
think
then the older coolers obviously don't
have this as for the lik tech TR for the
first one so we did that video
disassembling ours and showing some some
corrosion in it some gunk buildup stuff
like that and the the issue was we
thought potentially a like either a
disintegration of the gasket or a
corrosion or a lack of biocide or
something like that we've heard a few
theories about it we actually had one of
you in our audience
email us I think a son who who works at
like a government agency or something an
offer to send like over a dozen of these
so we're gonna do some failure analysis
when we get home but in first things
first I guess if you have an issue with
the tr4 cooler then animatics is
replacing them for free under RMA and if
they try to charge you shipping let us
know and we'll find it for you but
you're supposed to be able to get a free
replacement which is good so they taking
the right steps there the downside is
that obviously there was a failure to
begin with so we spoke to an engineer
from another company who has a theory
about it and we spoke with NR max the
engineer from the other company think
that thinks that there's a zinc
contamination in the liquid that's being
used to to sort of like I don't know to
join with the coolant so to like distill
it down or something so he that's his
theory and it thinks that the zinc is is
encountering a chemical reaction with
the propylene glycol causing the
contamination to build what enter max
thinks is that the the vacuum seal for
the original cooler was built for the
smaller pumps and so it wasn't built for
the larger TR for pump so with the tr4
to design that's supposed to be solved
so if you have the issue on cr.42 let us
know we'll look into it but it's
supposed to be fixed so yeah that's
that's the story so it's potentially a
vacuum seal issue is what it comes down
to but that'll walk us through the
coolers the pump is the new thing it's a
dual chamber design like I said coming
out on these coolers on the table here
and let's talk about the case is next
and I guess there's a brief interjection
there are some square fan so they're
square a RGB or square GB I guess is the
name so this square design there's a 200
as 120 there's 140 they've got
blackouts over there I think there's a
couple of white ones and then that's the
new fan but let's go take a look at the
cases and see what they have for ATX and
micro ATX so the next there's a couple
cases here there's this one which is a
80 X is another 80 X it's a micro ATX
and we'll start with the IG 50 so this
is the one that I mostly want to point
out there's two different panels where
there's a glass and then there's a mesh
panel which is good I'm really glad that
they showed this to me because Achtung
vas mocks - so we've encountered two
extreme overclockers today stepan z who
stole the mic from me in the in one
video and the headings here bauer and i
guess i'll link him below he's just
trying to get free links to his channel
i think by a period in the videos anyway
IG 50 so it's an ATX case supposed to be
$110 quarter for for the launch target
that's got to 200 millimeter fans
pre-install in the front a RGB and then
it has to 200 slots on the top not pre
installs he had to buy those with a slot
in the back for 120 or 140 and vertical
GPU mount all that stuff it's a new
tooling so this hasn't been used on
previous animatics cases no fan on the
power supply shroud but there are i
think you could maybe mountain SSD there
but no fan on it
so obviously points of discussion let me
throw this first this wasn't shuns me
until I started making a lot of
suggestions I guess is the best way you
could phrase it but so this is a
prototype it's a mesh panel what I need
you to do is help me convince enter max
that people prefer this over the glass
option um so mesh panel that's got a
dust filter on it it is a prototype I
don't know if it's going to have like
this case will have asked you that ships
with it or not
not sure I think it'll probably depend
on the response like to this video and
others but if it does then well you've
got an H 500 piece scenario like the
original one where it ships with a panel
that's extremely restrictive to the
point of being terrible to being
actually pretty good for airflow so
obviously you know the concern is you've
got a couple holes up here it is a
plastic panel you probably have like 5%
exposure to air and then the fans are
actually on the outside of the chassis
instead of recessed so they're pressed
all the way against the glass 200
millimeter fans are low static pressure
they have a lot of trouble pulling air
through
something that's impeding them so
anything with any kind of you know
impedance or restriction to airflow it
chokes it off a lot worse than like a
120 where it's got higher static
pressure to overcome that kind of issue
so anyway my complaint was obvious you
know you've got glass panel 200 and it's
it's literally the H 500 P all over
again except even worse intake on the
side so it was good to see that this is
a potential option and I hope this is
the one that they choose because you
don't even have to retool the panel so
that's the good thing is that the glass
here it's not like it's too late the
glass is just like maybe glued in or
something I think it's glued it's pretty
standard to do that looks like it's
glued to the inner wall of the front
plastic panel so in theory you can just
not use the glass and then put in a mesh
and stand they've already got the
tooling for that so that's what I hope
to see with IG 50 enter max does have a
lot they can improve on with this case
but it looks like they have the right
idea so next one well I shouldn't say
that it looks like they might have the
right idea if they do this it's still
expensive one hundred ten dollars and
it'll be competing with like the
original H 500 non P non M so H 500 from
Coolermaster about a hundred dollars
that's probably the primary competition
that's a really good case so I kind of
take that back I don't know that they do
have the right idea but I hope I've
given them the right idea because we
talked a lot about this case and the
improvements that could be made the
marble I think you all likely know what
I think of this front panel it's a
problem so it's this is the MS 30 this
is the MS 24 the fans it's got three 120
options the front one 120 in the rear
actually I'll talk after this this booth
will shoot a separate segment somewhere
else and I'll talk more openly but yeah
120 s back no 140 support on the micro
ATX or actually on the ATX micro ATX it
doesn't have a lot of representation at
the show so I've only seen one other
micro ATX case this year and this is one
of two so if you like micro ATX and you
hate air then you could get this maybe
there'll be a mass version who knows
this one is supposed to be a $60 to the
MS 3050 dollars to the ms-20 and there's
to be white and black versions we have
video both once
140 support and I think the 80 acts for
the front and micro-atx also supports
140 in the front in the last case
there's two more there's one behind me
that's the excellence for Japan so enter
max has gotten some awards in Japan I'm
told and apparently they've decided to
make an excellent model for Japan that's
got a gold rap on it like a wall paper
so there's a gold wallpaper on the
equivalence is supposed to be a thousand
dollar case up from about a hundred
dollars you ask for the standard version
it's a limited edition special one it's
got squares that of gold that stick on
the panel so it's like a gold foil and
I'll leave that that one there but
that's gonna be Japan only launched and
I think limited the Flex crepe DC 30s on
the other side of the wall here it's the
same structure as the sf-36 and you know
this one already that's supposed to be
quarter three there might be system
integrator customization on that and
that would be like your cyber power I'm
a power of the world people like that
could customize the panel's they've done
some samples of that looked kind of cool
$70 Target for that through and twenties
front ones 120 in the rear and two 140 s
in the top and like I said quarter three
for that one so that will cover the
cases let's let's shoot the conclusion
elsewhere
okay so part of what we do at the shows
is a lot of conversation with the
manufacturers to say like you know look
this is this is really disappointing to
see I'm very sad to see that you've
learned nothing from last year and we
talked about like genuine concerns
versus like like GaN being pedantic
concerns I try to be realistic about it
and there were some genuine concerns
there a lot of them and I've had this
conversation with NR max I think every
year for like for PR people now that's
how many they've gone through since we
started having this conversation so I
think it's time to just have the
conversation on video so that people can
see it and hopefully they feel a bit
more pressure to improve because I think
enter max yeah I want to see the
companies improve and do good things and
do things worth buying and I know max is
a fairly large company it's not huge but
big enough and they can improve but
they're just they're they're not in a
lot of ways they are in some ways very
small but not in cases
thus a brayer was a great case but the
stuff here today was just not good and
the marble one the SM one I didn't want
to keep knocking everything right in
front of them but they'll see the video
anyway but I the marble one just like
absolutely terrible airflow it's it's
totally tone deaf to the market and you
can still do a cool design without
suffocating the case you can do a side
and take if you had to you get to the
top and take pre-installed if you had to
you do bottom it there's a lot of stuff
you could do and still have a closed out
front but they're not doing it
the next thing small stuff so all of the
systems every one of them except for the
200 millimeter system the first one we
talked about they all had the fans on
the radiator in the front where exhaust
the fan in the back was exhaust and the
fans in the top were exhaust you know
anyway so exhaust exhaust exhaust there
was zero intake anywhere and this is
like actually zero and so you're left
with a negative pressure system with no
holes anywhere so there's no way to even
bring the area in so it's gonna find its
way in through small cracks and side
panels it's gonna find a way in through
small holes in the bottom none of that
will ever make it to the system and the
thing is those are just demo system
builds so it doesn't actually matter
like you can build the computer your own
way obviously when you get the case but
the problem is as I was explaining to
enter max is that it just makes it look
like you have no idea what you're doing
like you don't even look like you've
ever built a system before so I asked
you built the systems they said one of
our engineers which is just extremely
disappointing if that's true
so anyway it's I guess it all comes
together we're like some of these things
don't matter because you're not gonna
buy it like that some of them matter a
lot because it's actually affecting the
end product and what you buy so they all
come together and it creates the
appearance of a company that's
completely tone-deaf to the industry
oblivious to what they're doing has no
idea how to even build a computer with a
fan orientation properly and I'm sure
some people at this company do of course
but that presentation will has terrible
so the cases have a lot of them from
grew to the IG 50 as an example is the
only one that's even remotely promising
because there's a proto
at mesh panel that was only shown to me
after I asked for a case PM they brought
them over and then I explained the
issues for like ten minutes and then it
was shown to me so an ER Mac seemed like
they were listening I don't know if it's
gonna go anywhere I hope maybe this
video convinces people out like HQ
higher up that there's a problem like NR
max has a lot it needs to improve on and
this show just made them look
incompetent frankly so anyway very
disappointed in the booth and I don't
like doing negative show coverage
because like a lot of the time stuff is
prototypes and we're happy to see them
but this stuff is like now three times
running I think three shows where it's
just been bad so the same rate was the
last good thing they showed us so that's
it for this one thanks for watching
