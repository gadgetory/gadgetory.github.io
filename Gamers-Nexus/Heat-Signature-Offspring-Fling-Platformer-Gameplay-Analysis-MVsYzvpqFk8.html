and access dot net and today we were
looking at offspring and flame for a
heat signature which is our series that
I will be expanding now to be a more
analytical look at what makes these
indie games so great and why you should
pay more attention to them
offspring flame is available on Steam it
is a platformer game that is actually
based on a to quote the games about
section poor forest creature that has
misplaced all of her children and you
have to fight through the levels
basically throwing these baby
Pikachu things at different obstacles or
walls or challenges and you're using
them very similar in in the way that
Yoshi's Island or Yoshi's Story used the
Yoshi eggs of course in the older games
if you're familiar with those
you are basically picking them up and
throwing them to complete challenges and
then your goal ultimately is to get them
to the end of the level and save them
all which is where it differs slightly
from Yoshi's Story so that's the basic
mechanic it's it's just a typical
platformer you're running jumping and
throwing all of that good stuff and
completing different obstacles which
means that the game is highly level
focused because in platformers as many
of us know it is going to be skill and
level focused putting major emphasis on
dexterity and of course the developer's
ability to design a fluid level
offspring flames levels are very fluid
and they make you want to replay them
after getting through them the first
time that's something that really made
me play through this and hooked me
immediately some of the levels wear you
out and you kinda you say bump that I'm
not gonna do that a second time and
you're just happy to get it over with
but for the most part the timings and
goals set by the game the gold award
silver award which is basically just
completing it and the developer time
award means that it is a time trial
based challenge system you are not
required to beat them in a certain
amount of time because the timer takes
up and not down but it does keep you
playing
and the timings and goals are set so
accurately that you are often within
reasonable reach of the goal maybe a
second or two and that provides
encouragement to achieving it so that's
where the natural playability comes in
it the game and I'll be using the sword
a lot the game naturally lends itself to
just being highly playable and very easy
to just run through and kind of play for
a while and have fun and take it easy
while still having a very challenging
obstacle or level to complete so it's
not like it's easy mode but it does
appeal to both casual players and more
hardcore platformer players so it is uh
it is very good at educating the player
again it's it naturally lends itself to
educating the player actually and it's
levels are fast enough for dine stands
more as a point of learning unless as a
point of punishment you'll make mistakes
on each major step of the way it's just
that's just how these platformers work
we all know it you're gonna fall down
the hole or fall into lava or throw your
baby into the pit of acid so sorry I
swear I didn't mean to and you'll make
these mistakes definitely on the way but
the important thing is that the mistakes
are highly obvious it's you know
immediately why you failed or screwed up
or whatever you know why and that makes
it that much easier to overcome there's
never a question of why the heck that I
just died right there you know and you
can kind of study what just happened and
figure out okay I need to jump here and
then duck here or whatever in your next
patch through the level and and that
just means you're gonna die another
three seconds later to something else
and then you'll figure that one out and
you eventually make it through the
entire level without dying and then you
start speedrunning it because your first
time through you'll probably see okay
I'm five seconds away from getting the
gold time I can totally do that
you grab gold then you get within a
second or two of the developers time and
you
see the developers ghost character
running through the level if you're
close enough to his time and when you
see that that's kind of when you can
study exactly how he plays it and try to
beat his time which is actually fairly
challenging that's the biggest challenge
of the game so it it all makes you feel
very smart actually when you complete
these challenges and only to immediately
die and the cycle repeats itself but in
and out inevitably leads to your
completion of the level and it's it's
just really well-designed that's all I
can say about it the challenges are hard
without being prohibitively frustrating
and they still require dexterity and
planning to overcome in some cases so
everything seems to flow very well
together and it's all I'll definitely
thought out it has a fun look to the
game it's just it has really good art
style and fun characters and a fun idea
in general just throwing these babies
around to overcome things so that's the
word of the day for this game it's just
fun and I guess naturally flew it as I
said earlier so that's what makes it
good is just everything I just said why
you feel you feel smart when you
complete the challenges you don't feel
like you're getting beat up when you
keep falling and dying and it'll let you
skip a level and go to the next one if
you feel like the current one is just is
too tough for you or you don't like
something about it
so dine may make you lose 30 seconds
probably less and it's always obvious
what the cause was but not necessarily
obvious what the solution is and that's
where the game comes in with its reward
of both trial and error players if
you're one of those it will reward you
just as much as it rewards the slower
more strategic and thoughtful play
styles so if you see something that
looks like it might work and you can see
it from where you are but you're not
quite sure you know can I throw this
thing and jump and catch it and then
throw it again will that work or will I
die you can try that and you might lose
a couple seconds it's really not a big
deal which makes it perfect if you're
not the type of person who will sit
there before the game the level starts
and say okay this is my path I'm gonna
take go the game is welcoming and
encouraging of multiple play styles its
accessibility makes it fun for challenge
driven players and more casual players
and the egotistical I'm so smart
mechanic that rewards you for for
completing a playthrough quickly or even
just completing a level if it's a
particularly tough one is what drives
the whole game it drives it all home and
that's what makes it's it's the adhesive
the entire reward of these platformers
is to make the player feel good about
what they did and feel skilled and feel
like they're learning other it's not
like there's a story holding it together
we know that okay there's a baby and
whatever you got to save a big deal it's
you know just like lemmings you're it's
all skill and fun and and there's some
exploring element to it too of course
it's also accessible in its graphics
which make it a solid travel or laptop
or play at work game just because it is
going to be playable on nearly any PC of
course you can check our website for
more PC builds on that but that's that's
off spring fling that's everything you
need to know so go out there and check
it out it is on Steam currently for $8 I
highly recommend it I picked it up for
three during the sale but I would buy it
for eight definitely
I really enjoyed this game and I don't
enjoy games a lot anymore I've played a
lot of them so it definitely gets my
vote in terms of something highly
playable highly accessible that you can
have fun with without getting too
enraged and without without it being too
easy as well so check that out and we
are working on more hardware videos this
week as well as more of course game
based videos we'll have some stuff
online soon for you to check out on
castle story and other games that we've
covered previously so definitely give
all that a look if you like this video

make more of these and I will talk to
