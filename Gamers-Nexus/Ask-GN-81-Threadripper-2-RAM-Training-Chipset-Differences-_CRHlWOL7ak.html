episode as always leave your comments in
the questions section below kind of flip
that around if you have questions leave
them down there I'll get them next time
if I can we're still gonna go forward
and try the two episodes per week thing
we're basically gonna try and eventually
gap them about 12 to 15 hours apart and
if it goes over well we'll keep doing it
otherwise we'll go back to one so leave
your questions if you have them this
week we have a couple good ones on
chipset differences which definitely
need some clarification so I'll be
talking about that before that this
video is brought to you by thermal
Grizzly's high-end thermal paste and
liquid metal thermal Grizzly's cryo knot
is an affordable high quality thermal
compound that doesn't face some of the
aging limitations of other pastes on the
market cryo not has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted tests buy a tube at the link
in the description below quick update on
the mod mats first if you haven't back
ordered one you definitely should
because we still have them in stock
though we do tend to sell out of all of
them right around when our orders come
in that next order is already on the way
here it'll be here before we leave for
Computex which is next week from the
area of this video so they will be
shipping out around then it'll be about
a week from now that they ship out to
all of you then adding the time for your
regions and I think they'll be in here
with just enough time for me to
autograph the ones that you all wanted
to autograph so we should be good there
if you haven't backward one though get
it in because they're shipping out in
about a week next our first question is
from olivia turner who says what are the
differences between z 370 and z 390 from
a mainstream game or PC users and point
of view well actually you can look at it
from any user's point of view because e3
70 and 90 are really simple and it does
I agree that it requires some
clarification because I needed it to not
long ago we talked about this I think in
a news video but XIII 70 and 90 if you
look at two block diagrams side-by-side
which we did in that news video
it's basically identical the only
difference is the wireless AC support so
Intel has integrated wireless AC support
in the chipset now chips
level rather than just a board level and
that's on Z 390 other than that same
lanes same everything else there's I
think I know there are a couple more USB
3.1 options with Z 390 but that's not
really relevant to most people because
you're talking about like six versus ten
or ten verses fourteen USB ports so does
it really matter no not a whole lot it's
not like you're getting more lanes for
graphics which generally come off the
cpu anyway you can pull them from the
chipset but you don't really want to but
you're not getting more Aegis i/o lanes
high-speed i/o lanes and HS io lanes if
you don't know are basically chipset
lanes that the motherboard manufacturers
to some extent can control so say you
have 30 HS io lanes available to you
made available via the chipset by Intel
the motherboard manufacturer can decide
we're gonna we have these ones that are
required to be components X Y Z we're
gonna pull the other we're gonna pull
four of them and allocate them to a PCIe
slot for M 2 devices we're gonna pull
another 4 and allocate it to whatever
Paul Cal for more and give it to Gigabit
Ethernet and so forth so ancients IO is
assignable by the motherboard
manufacturer to some extent but you
don't get more of those with 390 versus
370 basically it's the same chipset so
in terms of functionality nothing is
really changing in a meaningful way
other than wireless AC which is not that
meaningful for a lot of us for desktop
use so you end up in a situation where
probably the only reason you're getting
a z3 90 board is to support the 8 core
CPU is if they have new power
requirements that the existing six core
CPUs don't have and we don't really know
exactly what's happening there yet I
know that some of the higher-end Z 370
boards have V around that are still
powerful enough for the eight core CPUs
coming out but I don't know anything
else beyond that that's really the
extent of my information that said we'll
see if anything comes about at Computex
which again officially I think it starts
June 4th or 5th and ends on the 9th
typically there's some coverage before
the show and a little bit after it so
make sure you tune in and we'll see if
we can find more on the new chipset
sometimes it comes out whether or not
Intel wants it to as for other chipsets
it is a little bit kind of a confusing
market right now with and the
more or less having copied Intel's names
to the point where Andy's launching a z4
90 I get why I am Dee did it that's fine
I do find it annoying that even on the
review side I can't keep straight which
motherboard is from which vendor without
looking at the socket anywhere that's
pretty annoying but if you're talking
like B 460 B 450 be 350 B 360 whatever
there are a lot of it's very easy to mix
them up now so if anyone's confused
about the chipset differences between a
chipset that has a 10-digit difference
like 350 versus 360 the difference is
one of them is for AMD and ones for
Intel and you can't really cross compare
them so you know you pick the one that
fits with the CPU you're buying but as
for intra company differences if you
7390 basically the same thing x4 70 X
370 more or less the same thing as well
except a couple things we talked about
in our 2700 X review if you're curious
check the review I think I talked about
it there not too much has changed though
for any of these new high-end chipsets
next question is from X Cleo who says
how does increase in VR I'm switching
frequency help overclocked in and what
way is performance affected by
increasing it higher is better question
mark this is a setting if you're not
familiar with it it's a BIOS setting and
most higher-end at least motherboard
BIOS options and I actually I posed this
question to build Zoid because I haven't
personally messed with VR I'm switching
frequency too much and build Zoid said
builds lloyd's from actually hardcore
overclocking YouTube channel if you
don't know it could check it out
he says vrm efficiency goes down if you
this is with increasing the switching
frequency BRM efficiency goes down
voltage regulation accuracy goes up and
ripple goes down so that's pretty direct
answer if you have voltage ripple
concerns then it sounds like it's
changing or increase in the switching
frequency would assist with those
regulation accuracy as he said goes up
so you end up with probably a flatter
voltage that's closer to what you want
more or less and then you could validate
it at the back of the socket if you
really wanted to by checking one of the
caps for the vrm the vcore vrm and yeah
i think that that more or less answers
there very directly though next question
from nori who says what's the difference
between dual channel and quad channel
memory clearly there is some hardware
difference check out these two sticks of
course here are GB thirty-two hundred
megahertz bottom is quad channel rise in
specific per quarter actually there is
no such thing as dual channel or quad
channel memory there is dual channel
configurations there are dual channel
configurations for motherboards there
quad channel configurations for
motherboards it's actually determined at
a platform level so technically it's
incorrect to say dual channel memory but
everyone will know what you mean if you
say it if you buy a kit of four sticks
of memory
it could be quad channel memory if you
wanted to call it that it's not really
the accurate thing to say but you have
four sticks of memory if you have a quad
channel motherboard then you could put
your four sticks of memory into a quad
channel motherboard and call it I guess
quad channel memory as long as the board
and the platform support it if it
doesn't support it if you're using like
a z 370 or x3 70 board that's dual
channel only then and you have four
sticks then it's put into a dual channel
configuration it could still be run as
quad channel but you need a platform
that supports it so the point is there's
actually no such thing as dual channel
memory or as quad channel memory even
though yes new I will list things like
that sometimes so if you ever are
looking for we've had people ask in the
past
why's quad channel memory so expensive
often it's because if you go to a retail
site and select that you're looking for
quad channel memory as they specify it
you're gonna get a really limited list
of things that are more expensive when
you could search for just any kind of
memory and as long as it's for sticks
it'll do quad channel assuming that the
motherboard has validated that supported
obviously as as we discussed in another
recent video stn video so actually that
was a patreon asked Jian video so if
you're not a patreon backer patreon.com
slash cameras and access all tiers get
the SP ends on the patreon upload it's
it's basically a bonus episode of this
and I talk about memory support actually
on that episode so you can check that
one out for more but anyway the point is
there's no such thing as that that said
I get your question so you can have
things like
dual ranked versus a single rank memory
you can have basically more modules on a
given PCB to achieve the same amount of
capacity so your density might change
per module and that does impact
performance it is more sensitive on some
platforms than others and that's I think
what your question comes down to it's
basically you're talking about how many
modules are on it to achieve the same
capacity which comes down to a question
of the density per module in terms of
gigabits how many gigabits per module on
the stick of memory basically and then
as noted some of them are dual sided
versus single sided and that also has
some impact on on how they branded or
what its performance is or how it looks
if you're looking if you take the cooler
the heatsink off said yes it'll look
different
next question Xanadu man says will AMD
be releasing a second generation
threader for line 29 xx I'm looking to
upgrade soon and I've had my eye on
thread Ripper
but if they plan on doing a second gen
soon I'll wait they are doing a second
gen as I'm aware the current plan is
August I think that was the last update
and they put out and I or I think they
put it out I think it was them I don't
know we weren't at the recent 2003 s
launch event but from what I understand
it was discussed there whether thread
referred to would be coming out and the
answer was probably August but I don't
know if that's changed and I'll
certainly let you all know when we find
out so that's my understanding whether
or not you want to wait that long is up
to you generally the way I look at this
should I buy or wait questions is are
you happy with the PC you have now today
or is there something really
specifically that's making you unhappy
with it to a point where you can't work
that efficiently or you don't enjoy
playing games on it if it's the latter
case then just just upgrade now cuz if
it's making you unhappy it's not worth
waiting because you're talking often
single-digit percentage changes it's not
like thread report versus a fax it's
threaded professor starter for two and
there will be an improvement certainly
if you are really core starved then
maybe wait because I think thread Ripper
two might have more cores but I'm not
positive on that if you're not and you
just want a high-end platform and you
kind of need something today just buy it
today if but yeah I mean just depends on
how desperate you are
next on Red Mage Cecil says for your
mitx case testing do you think there's
value in having a standardized
expandable test set eg full-length GPU
full-size tower cooler used in your
standard case reviews that you can use
to flex particular mitx cases that can
accommodate larger hardware to give a
more real-world representation of what
the cases are capable of where do you
think in muddy the data too much the
answer is yes it it would be beneficial
in some ways to have say a full length
GPU that we could test in off camera
maybe the SG 13 silverstone case we
talked about the eternal take core v1
both of those can fit longer GPUs it be
useful to test and I would agree that
there's there are definitely limitations
to testing Mini ITX cases with a
standardized test set of hardware
because as noted in the review there are
so many variables specifically with many
ITX cases that don't exist elsewhere
that it's really easy to kind of get
lost in a data set and not see that you
know you could put for example in the v1
a bigger cooler on it so like with the
testing we just posted you have the cry
rig otaku where it only fits like a 50
millimeter cooler and you have the v1
which could fit a mini tower cool or
maybe I don't know 90 millimeters or
something like that I'm not really sure
but it could certainly fit a bigger one
so yeah the the v1 could perform much
better in that regard but if we're
trying to standardize the test and you
can't cross compare them as everyone
knows so if we had a bigger cooler on
the v1 but not the Taku it's not really
a proper comparison so there's
definitely a methodological question of
to what extent can you synthesize
performance and validate box a versus B
for cooling abilities or for airflow if
ultimately you could put a better cooler
and box B because it's bigger so we
talked about that a bit whether or not
would it be worth it like he said I
would like to add more hardware I'd like
to add a full-length GPU or different
coolers for larger cases the problem is
it costs a lot of money to do that
not because the products cost money to
get necessarily but because we already
can invest several days in testing a
case and I have to
pay people to do that we pay to produce
the videos I pay to pay Patrick to do a
lot of the testing or building I have a
time cost as well and once you factor
all that stuff in we start losing money
really fast if I'm testing say two
different GPUs and two different coolers
even those to do the different fan
configurations we do it gets expensive
fast we're not careful and go kind of
crazy with it so depend on how popular
the content is it can be worth it like
if we if we revisit it into the
standalone content piece of just here's
a bunch of ITX cases that can fit
full-length cards let's test only those
and nothing else it might be worth it if
we're not switching cards but if we're
switching devices just I mean
realistically I have to make money to
keep a business going and it cost me a
lot of money to do that you're talking
multiple extra days of work because if
we take our current test set and say it
takes two to three days and we multiply
it by two configurations it's a linear
so easy math four to six days you add
another cooler configuration now you're
looking at like more than a week and you
definitely in our position would lose
money doing that so certainly as the
channel grows we can continue to expand
like that that's why we added ITX cases
because we've grown to a point where I
can support it now it's just it's gonna
have to be an incremental thing I do
want to get there but you know just be
patient with me as a channel continues
to pick up speed we'll continue to add
stuff like that because we'll be able to
afford it more or justify it from a
business standpoint because ultimately I
have to pay people so but I do agree it
would be absolutely something I want to
do it just a matter when can we afford
to do it or justify it
next question Doctor Who who says this
question is about rammed training we
have heard the term used many times what
actually goes into Ram training is this
a handshake between motherboard and RAM
then reported back to BIOS or the
chipset our multiple boot records of
frequencies that worked stored by the
motherboard so upon next boot it knows
what should probably work this is we
actually have a piece coming up somewhat
soon on this question I'm going to read
an excerpt from the scripts for that
because it addresses it pretty directly
this is written by Patrick Nathan who
works for us on some of that stuff and
Patrick wrote Ram doesn't set its own
frequency and timings ultimately the
BIOS does with SPD XMP
a starting point on Intel boards this
element of BIOS is called the MRC which
means memory reference code this is one
area where board manufacturers can
secure an advantage in performance
because the sheer variety of RAM and the
difference is between Samsung micron and
hynek's those are the chip makers not
the memory manufacturers they the
differences between them make tertiary
timings hideously complex to adjust
memory and board manufacturers can work
together to bacon optimal timings for
popular kits but for the most part there
are determined if they are determined if
left on auto at post so that answers a
lot of your question where they should
remain unchanged unless they're a boot
failures so during training the
integrated memory controller the IMC
will attempt different timings it tries
other things too there's more than just
timings but it'll try to pin timings try
to boot and it might fail so if it fails
a lot of the times the solution to a
boot failure related to memory is to
wait and try it again and the board will
cycle maybe three times and if you can't
do it it'll go back into BIOS but if you
feel like sitting there and pushing the
retry button over and over some boards
have a white reach high button on it you
can often get it to boot with timings
that it's trained that's what training
is to work and from that point on you
should be good it'll mostly stabilize
things every now and then if it's really
borderline you might end up with memory
failure or memory errors not failure
memory errors during a really memory
intensive benchmark but if you're just
doing like time aspire gaming it'll be
okay to be doing anything super memory
intensive and calculation intensive then
obviously fix it but so yeah during
training by EMC tries a variety of
settings to stabilize the system not all
of which are timings and it retries on
each boot until it succeeds so if memory
isn't stable with XMP just allow it to
reboot a few times before giving up
basically and we'll talk about this more
soon next one there's only a couple left
here
Jason Blasi says my brother put
conducting on his 580 and now it won't
boot guessing he shorted it anything we
can do to get it running again already
tried cleaning it off and reapplying
Arctic silver 5 instead yeah that's this
is why we don't generally do liquid
metal on a bare die for a GPU
so you could do stuff like I mean first
of all for your situation clean it like
really thoroughly and not just the dye
area but the whole board just liquid
metal has a tendency to kinda jump
around as you're cleaning it if anyone's
ever pushed liquid metal around with
like a q-tip or a paper towel you'll see
that kind of balls up and it's really
easy for it to just jump it'll kind of
like almost almost in a magnetic fashion
grab on to a nearby component so it's
possible that there's just some that you
missed I would say rubbing alcohol works
the best hit the dye and everything
around the dye be really careful with
applying fingernails like if you try to
put pressure around the die area to
scrub stuff off and you're using your
fingernails and you hit an SM like a
small surface mount device SMD like a
pastor it's really easy to rip those off
so be careful but Robbie and alcohol
should fix it use a q-tip where there's
really tight areas that you can't really
get with paper towel
hopefully that fixes it you could try
compressed air I guess anti-static
compressed air should be fine I would
prefer to just clean off with rubbing
alcohol because then you know you're not
blowing it around into other components
but if you really have to you can try
that as far as preventing this in the
future probably use the last liquid
metal and then assuming it's a
horizontally mounted GPU just apply like
a nail polish to the area around the GPU
or if you don't want to do that you can
use different types of tapes like
captain tape which is a thermal tape and
that'll protect it in case some of the
liquid metal spills off the sides but
otherwise yeah just clean it and be
really careful make sure it's absolutely
clean because you don't want to end up
in a situation where it's it shorts
something to a point that you fry a
component if it's just short circuiting
that like a direct short you can
normally still fix it get it to boot
just fine once it's clean is this the
last one this is the US from the same
guy Doctor Who doctor who says again I
went back in time to ask another
question this question concerns power
supplies and maybe something you can
integrate into your upcoming testing if
it is in fact if it is in fact different
depending on the power supply but who
actually makes the power supplies are
they designed in-house
components delivered and built at a
known Factory are they designed by the
company but actually making the product
is outsourced or are they completely
outsourced for a specific unit is
designed and built by and then the logo
slapped onto it the answer is yes to
basically all of those so the first
question who makes the power supply's
like most things like this liquid cooler
this is made by ASA TAC technically they
make the pump they assemble the radiator
base but they work with NZXT to specify
everything so in the case of a liquid
cooler NZXT specified with a stack that
they want this braided sleeve on it they
NZXT built a custom PCB to go in here
for RGB lighting all that stuff not a
nun's exe ad just saying that's the
differences that they do so ultimately
the performance of this thing that is
dictated by ASA Tech for the most part
other than the fans which to some extent
are made by the manufacturing partner
power supplies are the same way so power
supply manufacturers or suppliers
include C Sonic channel while technology
super flower there's a couple other ones
great wall sir tech Flextronics so
they're cut and some of those are much
bigger than others but see Sonic's
common one channel while technology is
pretty popular as well and so it's super
flower so there's kind of three of the
bigger groups they are the suppliers for
a lot of it and then the companies like
Coursera EVGA etc will work with those
companies see Sonic making their own
kinda like Samsung makes their own
memory devices they'll work with them to
specify what they want Corsair does
stuff like puts in special PFC chips and
things like that so there's some level
of customization certainly by the
manufacturing partners it's made in a
factory often owned by one of the
suppliers I just listed but that doesn't
mean that EVGA Corsair and all of them
aren't making the power supply in the
sense that they are still designing them
and they saw the engineers working to
solve specific problems that their users
have and the suppliers work to the spec
now it's also true that a supplier can
have a platform just like AZ Tech has a
Gen 5 platform offer it to the partners
manufacturing partners and say this is
what we got here are the few things that
you can change on the list is maybe RGB
LEDs or maybe the fan or some other
small
cables so if if it's a cheaper power
supply there's a good chance they're
working off of an existing platform and
customizing very little if it's a high
end power supply like an X 1600 I or
something like that they've probably
customized quite a lot just it really
depends on what it is and then also
finally to answer your last question do
they design stuff and then or do they
just slap their logo on it
they're definitely power supply's where
they just slap that logo on it just like
there are with coolers to the for
example is I'm the original Arctic
coolers the whatever they called it
liquid freeze or whatever they were some
of those were basically just out of the
box is tacky and it's with almost zero
customization so you can have that too
it just depends on the price the unit
and we'll talk about more soon so that's
it for this time as always there's a
patreon special episode we'll have
another ass Jen coming up soon if this
isn't the first one it'll be a second
one obviously go to patreon.com/scishow
