we're gonna be taking a look at EVGA s
1080 FTW gaming hybrid PCD damn that
names along yeah this PCB actually gets
reused on the regular 1080 FTW as well
as the 1070 FTW and the 1070 FTW gaming
hybrid I'm not sure if it includes the
gaming
either way the water-cooled 1070 FTW
from EVGA also uses this PCB before
getting to build Zoids PCB analysis this
content is brought to you by iBUYPOWER
and their new element gaming pc with a
full tempered glass side window tempered
glass front LED is in the front and
bottom and it is basically a modified
s340 there is some slight slight
alterations for the 1070 s and we'll
cover those right after we cover all the
major VRMs on this card so first things
first core voltage is right here and
second so that there is the core voltage
erm above that we find the memory the RM
then down here you get the 1 1 volt PLL
so this is basically a miner rail that
goes to the GPU core and it's necessary
for some non calculation related non
compute related functionality inside the
GPU core so the GPU won't work without
it but it's not important enough to you
know have variable voltage control or
anything it just needs to be
ever-present
you can access it via software it is not
affected by overclocking in any way
shape or form and raising the voltage on
this really doesn't affect overclocking
either so you don't have to worry about
it
it is however copy pasted right off the
founders Edition like literally even the
component layout right here is the same
as on the founders Edition and so you
really don't have to be work like if
Nvidia thinks this will last the
lifetime of a GTX 1080
then there's no reason to think you know
to think that you need a stronger vrm
here so this is perfectly fine and you
can forget about it then
over here we get the last vrm that's
located on this card this is the 1.8
volts for the gddr5 X so this goes to
the gddr5 X chips 1.8 volts functions
similar to this vrm right here it has no
impact on overclocking it is not an
important vrm and does not need to
produce a lot of power
however the gddr5 X won't work without
it on the other hand gddr5 does work
without this and so the 1070 FTW s don't
have this vrm this is just cut off on
the 10 17 s because they run gddr5 and
this is only required for gddr5 X so
that covers all the major VRMs on the
card now let's actually look at the
details of the V RMS so this is our core
voltage v RM and it has 10 phases 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and of course we have
also 10 power stage things to accompany
them right so there that's 10 as well
now I call them power stage things so
let's talk about these ICS here these
are NCP 8 1 3 8 2 's and I call them
power stage things because they're
almost everything you need to make a
power stage except they lack some of the
more advanced features that a power
stage usually has these things are a
high side MOSFET low side MOSFET and a
driver IC put into one chip so basically
it saves cost
it saves PCB space it improves
efficiency because there's you know all
over the ice like all of your different
MOSFETs are all integrated really close
together so that obviously improves
their efficiency there's really no
downside to this design so array for
integrating everything either way these
things are rated to do 35 amps average
current and 70 amps
keek so you know that basically means
this vrm right here can provide 350 amps
continuous current with ease the GT X
1080 FTW you know a GT X 1080 at stock
clocks requires about 160 M so this V R
M this one right here is extremely
overkill right because it feeds the GPU
core which means about 160 amps at stop
clocks the typical overclocking range on
the 10 series cards is about 15% soo and
you can't raise voltage on them so 160
times you know you know let's just slap
on 20% onto that so that's what 20% of
that is 32 so that gets us to just under
200 amps average power draw this is
built for 350 you really don't have to
worry about this about breaking this vrm
because you don't you can't control the
voltage and the GTX 1080 is incredibly
power efficient so yep this is extremely
overbuilt extremely extremely over built
so yeah but before we move on to the
memory of erm I would like to address
one thing you can't make 10 phases which
is weird cuz I just said we have 10
phases here right but you can't make 10
phases well I mean you can make 10
phases worth of components but you can't
run them like you actually have 10
phases so the thing is they're they're
the current like if you're going to go
shopping for a voltage controller right
the highest phase count you can get from
the voltage controller is going to be 8
nobody makes a 10 phase voltage
controller there is a very good reason
for this because 10 phases have
basically no performance improvement
over eight phases and they are a hell of
a lot more expensive to do just because
of the the complexity required to do
more and more phases is actually
not linear it gets worse and worse as
you try to add more and more phases so
this has ten phases and nobody makes a
ten phase a voltage controller so how
does EVGA get ten phases so they use
doubler ICS which are right here and if
you know to something one two three four
five so there's five of them right and
they're doublers so obviously five goes
in times two you get ten and these are
NCP eight one one 62s
they do offer like they're not
completely brain-dead but with how VR
M's work they basically offer no real
advantage over brain-dead doublers and
by brain-dead doublers I mean so usually
what you have is you have the control
signal from the voltage controller it
goes into like if you have an eight
phase voltage controller what right you
get eight control signals but here we
have a five phase voltage controller
well I actually don't know how many
phases the controller has because I
never found a datasheet for it but it
has at least five so you have five
control signals right and so the
controller know will control the fly
will feed the five doublers and what the
doublers do is they take that control
signal and they pass it between the two
phases they don't actually you know they
don't do anything miraculous to improve
your control over the two different
phases so usually one of these control
signals will be like 400 kilohertz and
the control signal is literally pwm
that's literally how phases get
controlled by PWM so you have a 400
kilohertz PWM signal going into the
doubler and basically what these
doublers will do is they will give that
PWM pulse to whichever phase currently
has the least current going through it
so that is some you know more advanced
functionality but just because of how VR
M's work the the the phase that has the
least current through it will almost
always be the phase that wasn't
charged the last PWM impulse so these
don't really offer any kinds of control
advantages and so essentially you have
the same control over your phases as if
you had a five phase because the voltage
controller is doing you know it's
putting out 400 kilohertz of PLM signals
but the actual phase is C 200 kilohertz
so yeah this is pretty much the same
power quality as a five phase EVGA could
have very easily opted to build a five
phase vrm with much much higher power
phases right so these are 35 amp phases
EVGA could have gone and built a five
phase with 70 M phases and for all
intents and purposes
it should like if they didn't really
mess up with any of the components too
much it would get the exact same
performance as this here 10 phase VRM so
the 10 phases are very much a marketing
stunt from my point of view like I see
it as a marketing stunt now ten phases
is not a complete waste of time and
money and energy and effort okay they do
have some benefits having lots of phases
first of all you spread your heat load
so the vrm will run cooler because well
you have ten phases which you know are
putting out heat instead of having five
phases putting out heat because even
five high-power phases are still
relatively small and so you get really
high heat density with a low phase count
which makes the vrm run hotter than if
you have a lot more phases doing less
work you know and sharing the work more
so this does have better thermals but it
doesn't really perform any better than a
five phase running at 400 kilo hertz
would so mostly a marketing thing here
as far as I'm concerned now you know a
10 phase does actually have a benefit
because if you want to you can crank up
the frequency on the voltage controller
well on some of them if you have control
over them you can actually crank up the
frequency and then you actually can get
you know you can put like a megahertz
into the doublers and then the actual
phases see 500 kilohertz and then it
would actually perform better than a
five phase unless you also took the 5mm
phase to a megahertz except that would
lower your efficiency because switching
phases really really really quickly
lowers your efficiency so yeah this will
be more efficient and it'll have better
thermals but it will not deliver better
power quality well it's not even power
quality voltage quality then a five
phase properly designed five phase but
still you know I think better efficiency
and better thermals are probably enough
to make this a justified use of ten
phases even though I personally think
they really didn't have to go ten they
could have done an eight or six or so
many other vrm yeah you know it's just
yeah oh well at least they have one of
the GTX 1080s with the most phases
because that's kind of what I think was
the decision behind choosing the number
ten because it's more than most of the
other ten 80s as far as I know I think
only ZOTAC has a sixteen phase card so
yeah mostly a marketing thing it does
have some benefits but that that could
be argued then above that we have the
memory vrm this is a two phase using 4c
85n you know 4c 85n on semiconductor
MOSFETs again well normal sets the these
right here are a high side and the low
side MOSFET integrated into one chip so
that's why we have two phases and only
two two ICS instead of two phases and
for ICS the drivers for these aren't
present because the voltage controller
for these integrates the light has
powerful enough PWM signals to actually
fully power these on its own so yeah
each of these can do about 30 amps at
125 degrees that's worst case scenario
so that's 30 amps continuous if
not running them continuous then they
can do a lot more since they're in a vrm
you know in a two-phase vrm then they're
not gonna and even if they were in a 1
phase they're not gonna run continuous
in a vrm like this producing low voltage
out of 12 volts so yeah no concerns here
so you have 30 amps in each of those so
the whole vrm is 60 amps and incredibly
overkill because gddr5 x usually pulls
around less than 20 so yeah these chips
all together pull less than 20 amps so
yeah very very overkill again and really
no complaints about any of the power
quality on the card I mean the 10 phase
is a marketing stunt but hey it's still
a good vrm so you know there's no reason
to match EVGA for it it's just it's just
I'm trying to make sure that you
understand that just because you have
ten phases doesn't mean that they're
better than eight phases or six phases
or five phases right they are better
than four because you because of four is
worse controlled than than of five but a
five a six and an eight can actually
rival this here vrm just fine for
everything except maybe efficiency
depending on how it's driven so yeah so
that's the vrm is covered and over here
nice little detail EVGA gives you a BIOS
which so you know if you're interested
in BIOS loading this card will have you
covered if you screw up or if somebody
puts out a unlocked BIOS for the FTW
that actually gets you voltage control
and higher power limits or whatever you
can go to town on the card because this
vrm will definitely hold you know
survive pretty much anything you can
throw at it
and this BIOS which will make sure that
when you flash the BIOS you're not
screwed if something goes
wrong so yeah this PCB here is you know
really really nice I'm gonna stop
ripping on the ten phases now but yeah
it's a nice PCB there is really no
nothing wrong with it you know you can
yeah you can definitely overclock it to
on air coat like on the stock cooler so
you know this comes with an air cooler
or the or a closed-loop AIO
for the hybrid model on either of those
you don't have to worry about ever you
know getting anywhere near the limits of
what this VP CV can actually power of
what this VR I'm can power and this vrm
can power even on ln2 I'd be pretty I'd
feel pretty safe running this card on it
lnto my only complaint for trying to run
this on ln2 is that voltage controller
doesn't have a public data sheet so I
wouldn't be able to go anywhere with it
and that about yeah that covers
everything there is to know about well
everything worth knowing about the 1080
FTW gaming hybrid PCB from EVGA as well
as the you know the 1070 FTW and the
1080 FTW regular air-cooled card so yeah
