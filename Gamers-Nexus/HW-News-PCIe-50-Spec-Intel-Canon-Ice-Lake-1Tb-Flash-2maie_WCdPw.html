for the past week of hardware launches
including some new stuff today kind of
from e3 and then a lot of stuff from
Computex some that we didn't get a
chance to see at the show items of note
include logitech new wireless charging
mouse and mouse pad which is basically a
it's a magnetic resonance charger the
cryo reg CPU coolers are also on our
list we're talking about some of the
other cooling solutions at Computex
alpha cool FSP and so on and then PCIe
5.0 in the industry section of the news
roundup before that this content is
brought to you by custom backplate
makers at v1 tech comm v1 tech build GPU
back plates to order with their online
customization tool making it easy to
theme upcoming PC build back plates cost
$25 and up and are installed via magnet
and can be seen in some shots of the
cards reviewing that lately used code
gamers Nexus 5 for $5 off your order or
click the link below
starting with Logitech's announcement at
e3 today the company is putting out a
new series of products there's the G 703
mouse and g9 o 3 Mouse both of these
mice have the same weight cartridge or
container in the bottom of the mouse but
it's actually functional now it's not
just a 10 gram weight or whatever it may
be the weight cartridge now can contain
a unit that I think they're calling a
Power Core or power module and that is
used to make contact with basically a
second mouse pad so there's a power play
pad they call it which is a charging
station for the mouse and that sits
underneath the mouse mat the normal mat
it's about 2 millimeters thick so it's
not too much taller than normally and
that is able to provide enough current
to the mouse just via USB 2.0 in order
to power both the receiver the wireless
receiver and power the charging to a
level that you could charge and slightly
trickle charge the mouse while using it
or if you wanted to you could plug it in
for a faster charge we'll have a lot
more detail on this in the article below
but the basics of it are just tuned in
mice the G 903 is the G 900 but now
compatible with this power play set up
the mat is about 100 bucks so if you
wanted to add the wireless charging
support it would be $100 more it is not
the most efficient way to charge a
product this never has been inductive
charging is a bit more efficient but
also not nearly as efficient as plugging
something in but it's a way to remove
the mouse from the cable to the mouse so
if you want to do that this is really
the only way to achieve that without
ever having to plug it in between use or
something like that we'll look at this
in more depth and review it properly but
for now it's USB 2.0 so it can deliver
500 milliamps at 5 volts we don't know
how much current is actually transferred
to the device during use we'll talk to
them more about that it the base
underlying base creates a an e/m field
that charges the mouse from a radius out
of the center of the pad the powerplay
mat and towards the edges it will be
weaker but hopefully not over towards
the edges anyway works via magnetic
resonance not the same as course there's
new wirelessly charge Mouse that you may
have seen at copy text which I believe
uses the Qi charging setup so it's a bit
different than that this power play mat
because of the way it's designed means
it won't work if you have a metal table
or other large metal objects like a
metal mouse pad on top of it but it will
work with normal Mouse pads of some kind
of fabric so again more information on
that in the article below
but moving on now is a cryo rig on top
of launching the new Taku K is currently
on Kickstarter cryo rig has a new series
of CPU coolers so they have an update to
the CPU power series that would include
the cryo reg c7 and the r5 and the new
coolers some of them will have variants
that include copper for the thin stack
rather than aluminum this is interesting
for a few reasons now one thing coppers
heavier it's more expensive so that'll
be reflected in the price and in support
for how large the cooler can be before
it starts posing a problem for the
socket spec for mounting force and
weight but it also has a lot greater
thermal conductivity although because of
the way copper works with its specific
heat capacity versus aluminum you end up
with a situation where thermal
conductivity is far greater but it also
will take longer to heat up and cool
down
so this is interesting because it makes
it act sort of like a liquid cooling
radiator where you see those longer soak
times where the cooling device takes
longer to to soak the temperature so
like with a liquid cooler you end up
with a more even fan curve over time the
fan ramping speed should be a little bit
slower hard to say just how much without
actually testing it we have asked them
for both aluminum and copper units to
test that so
fan ramp will be a bit slower and other
than that once you at steady state the
difference probably won't be huge maybe
a couple degrees but we'll look into all
that hopefully if we can get one of each
cooler and that will be coming out the
c7 comes out first and on the r5 will
come out later this year and other than
that it's it's priority coolers as
normal
also at combi Tech's FSP demonstrated a
new liquid cooled power supply which is
an interesting mixture of things to have
in a power supply $700 price for this
one it looks like it should be called
the FSP hydro PTM plus 80 plus platinum
RGB LEDs of course
and again liquid cooled now a few things
about this liquid cooling a power supply
for our type of system builds enthusiast
audience isn't really necessary you can
passively cool a lot of power supplies
if you have the money to pay for it
these days and you still need to have a
fan active anyway so liquid coin and
power supplies is very much a bling
factor type of thing there may be some
functional adds to it that are not
covered in our use cases or for our
audience but for our audience this is
it's just so you could say you have a
liquid cooled power supply that's
probably the start in the end of it so
something to look out for personally
speaking I don't know that I want a
liquid cooled power supply in my system
liquid cooling in general is fairly safe
and if there is some sort of leak maybe
it goes into the back of the video card
and you kill a video card worst case
scenario but certainly not not a power
supply so I'm very interested to hear
more from FSP about how the power supply
works how they've insulated things first
if the it you would think it has to be
done and how how the liquid actually
impacts performance for a longer up time
at a higher load but we look into all
that more as with all this other stuff
from Computex times need the rest of
this year alpha cool is the next in
cooling news so they have new CPU and
GPU blocks that were shown at Computex
as well and they also have new helix
reservoirs they're called in addition to
the water blocks the helix reservoirs
and the RGB illumination at the head of
the show alcohol also has a new 420
millimeter ice bear a i/o cooler or CLC
if you prefer and their Aurora HT
lighting accessory which is used for
illuminated tubing and coolant and then
they've also got a custom cable modding
kit so they're branching out of it this
year the company's new water blocks by
the way will be using nylon so that's a
bit different alpha cool notes this has
been more resistant to cracking and
warping over time also in accessories
news that Sapphire has new add-ons for
their nitro series of video cards
primarily colorized back plates and
shrouds so you can add some color to the
existing nitro video card lineup and
they also showed off mini ITX cards and
an external GPU adapter which seems to
be increasingly popular last year we saw
a lot of them and that trend has died
off a bit this year but it's still
continuing for external GPUs moving on
to industry topics now SK Hynix is at 72
layer nand is on track to ship this year
and the memory maker has made it known
that they are currently working on noon
and with 96 and 128 layers respectively
this will allow for 512 gigabits and one
terabytes die capacity and for one tear
of it that's actually a hundred twenty
eight gigabytes on a single die which is
really dense data storage micron and
Toshiba are working on 64 layer 3d man
now as well though that should ship a
bit sooner than the multi-year project
that SK Hynix is currently developing
now one of the more interesting news
topics for this week although we don't
have a ton of data on it right now the
PC is IG board is working on developing
its spec for PCIe 5.0 4.0 of course not
being out yet 4.0 it looks like it's
supposed to start being used
some level anyway in 2018 and 5.0 should
have the spec finalized and released to
manufacturers in 2019 that does not mean
they'll start using it in 2019 just
means they're going to have it just like
the PCIe 4.0 specs been available for a
little while now but isn't actually on
boards yet for for any of our markets so
PCIe 5 it looks like it should offer
over 32 gig transfers per second for a
single lane and to put that into
perspective that's the speed we get
today for pcie 3.0 by 4 so four lanes of
3.0 gets you the same as a single lane
of 5.0 at 32 gig of transfers per second
with PCIe 4.0 being in between the two
and shipping sooner probably next year
for some of its initial appearances and
as we move towards more big data
applications
it looks like PCIe might be getting a
bit of a fast-track as the interface
needs to develop to keep pace with other
products video cards and adding cards
and accelerators and all that stuff so
keep an eye on the PC is IG board going
forward but for now PCIe 5.0 is the item
to talk about and I'm looking at Intel's
lineup Canon Lake and ice Lake have a
bit more information out Intel's pushing
ever onward with their seemingly
Ackerson 10 nanometer production however
in a recent celebratory tweet by Intel
the company's how did reaching a
milestone with 10 nanometers Canon Lake
is on track for shipping in the second
half of 2017 and ice Lake is taped out
or in the final stages of design
development and so forth before hitting
the fab Intel's 440 nanometer chips
Coffee Lake is still expected to ship
this year as well so they're gonna have
a busy final half of the year and
speaking of Intel the company's products
were used to set new overclocking world
records last week at Computex with the
i7 77 40k and X $2.99 platform MSI
gigabyte and g.skill were all applauding
overclocking records this past week
achieved on that platform and gigabyte
and their teams of overclockers that
burned through $20,000 of liquid helium
to hit a 7.5 gigahertz clock on the new
i7 CPU while ln2 is used to push
a presumably new memory kid from g.skill
to 5.5 gigahertz or 50 500 megahertz
ddr4 we covered both of these beats and
a bit more depth over on the website if
you want to check those articles out and
just for some perspective on that cost
we were speaking with their Bauer at the
g.skill booth when we did that deal it
in video with him and I asked how much
does it cost you when you start using
liquid helium and where he is his region
of the world it's about four point four
dollars per second is that it's open
just to put that $20,000 number into its
perspective so definitely a lot more
expensive than ln2 or you might pay
something like $1 maybe $2 per liter big
difference there finally there were some
displays there's a whole lot of
miscellaneous news for this past week
but for display news we tend to include
a bit of this towards the end Samsung's
got a new cue LED and HDR gaming monitor
lineup including some that are in the 40
plus inch range if that's something
you're interested in of these they
announced the VA panels that are HDR
enabled the screens are curved that's a
thing now and they feature the same 1800
hour curvature you see everywhere else
so curved screens are kind of like
tempered glass at this point where you
seen it everywhere but depending on how
big the monitor is it can actually be
useful speaking from experience the
modders are looking at 144 Hertz refresh
rates on some of them freesync to will
be supported so that was announced at
CES and is finally getting
implementation and prices range from
$600 to $1500 asus has new rog swift PG
27 UQ monitors coming out as well and
these will also be HDR displays quantum
dot enabled and will be a 4k
twenty-seven inch IPS panel also with a
refresh rate of 144 Hertz so that pretty
much covers us for the last week and
news plenty of smaller stuff at the show
and stuff that we just didn't get to for
example and our max max Titan power
supplies if power supplies interest you
guile has an nvme SSD EK water blocks
has an MSI X 370 X power titanium mono
block coming out and then there's also
the Apple iMac Pro
I guess so that covers everything as
always you can you can subscribe for
more information and go to

head directly thanks for watching I'll
see you all next time
however in a recent celebratory however
in a recent celebrate celebrate in a
recent celibate celebratory it's hard to
say fast</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
