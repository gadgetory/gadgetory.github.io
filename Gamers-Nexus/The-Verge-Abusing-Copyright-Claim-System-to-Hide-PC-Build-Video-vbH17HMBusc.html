important topic for YouTube and those of
us who live off of YouTube
so the verge recently filed a copyright
claim against Pitt with Kyle which
turned into a strike temporarily it also
filed one against review tech USA and
presumably other youtubers for their
parodies of the Verge's a four month old
video on how to build a gaming PC and
most of us know how that went at this
point it would did not go over well the
video was very bad if you missed out on
that
so this video it had its commons
disabled before being ultimately removed
from the site it has been gone from the
site from several months now we've all
pretty much forgotten about this thing
but it's a big aggression coming out of
nowhere from a professional highly
respected news organization such as the
verge hey youtube it's me Nilay Patel
editor-in-chief of the verge we have a
big team of tech reporters with a deep
understanding of tech and how it affects
the world jump I actually jump in I can
punch and I'm just knocking buildings
over is sheer stupidity
there's just no content but they find a
way to remind everybody that they exist
and let's sign back there that's another
example of it this is so depressing we
believe and YouTube does too evidently
that Kyle's video constituted fair use
specifically parody or satire seen as
that's what it was and YouTube did side
with Kyle eventually although when we
started working on this it had been
undecided at that point and YouTube
reinstated his video it also presented
concerns to the verge parent company Vox
media over potentially illegitimate
claims filed in this instance and media
organizations have used the DMCA it to
get back at each other for criticisms in
the past it's actually that's what I
just said that's a quote from the verge
they wrote it in 2015
referencing the Sunday Times and a DMCA
notice that was filed by it and then the
verge went on to further states quote it
set off the Streisand effect at most and
will probably go no further
the irony is
tangible here before that this video is
brought to you by us and the new gamers
Nexus medium mod matte this is a 32 inch

service meant to protect your desk and
your components while building systems

bioships shunt resistors and more and is

screw grids for your convenience grab
your GN medium mod mat GBA teardown
edition on store doc gamers nexus dotnet
or click the link below we see these
actions by Vox media as an egregious
abuse of its position and power in the
market
although the verge has a 30% reduction
year-over-year in traffic volume which
is a sort of staggering loss in the
amount of visitors its website is
receiving it is still unarguably a
massive website and this isn't just
YouTube drama here it's an important
Keystone weakness in YouTube's copyright
claim system and it's one that has
affected us in the past we have always
successfully battled these claims when
they're filed because they are in every
instance that we've battled thus far
invalid and that's because well really
for the most part almost anyone can file
one and although it has gotten better
recently you didn't always have to be in
any sort of legitimate positioning to
make that filing so you can sort of
temporarily withhold the advertising
revenue from those who return those
content creators by filing such a claim
in this instance though it wasn't really
that type of claim it was a takedown the
video was gone and Kyle had to go
through YouTube to get it reinstated so
this is a wide-reaching thing these are
issues that we deal with or at least
think about on a daily basis across all
the creators in the community so even if
the claims are illegitimate or
short-lived and resolved they are still
problematic it takes time from us it
takes money
sometimes the fights depending on how
fiercely the other side wants to keep
that claim in place and this could be
leveraged by manufacturers in much the
same way that the verge is attempting to
leverage it to control damage that well
really was just a parody of its own
missteps from form
ago and to that end you know a
manufacturer could try to file a similar
type of copyright claim in fact game
developers and publishers have done this
in the past we've had those as well
for negative or critical reviews or
reviews which they believe show their
game in a light that is undesirable so
it is not a far leap to suggest that a
component manufacturer could attempts to
follow the same path if it's so desired
and we're clueless enough and in an
intensive pollak state to do so so this
is something that the verge even knows
it's well aware of this the verge and
its staff presumably are self-aware to
some extent and one of the 2017 articles
that the verge published referred to
this specific type of use the one that
they're doing now of copyright claims on
YouTube as a quote weaponization of
copyright let's level here all media
organizations make mistakes the world
moves too fast we published too much
content it happens and we make mistakes
I mean just recently we published a
video where we swapped firestrike GT 1
GT 2 footage and the content now the
thing is how do you deal with those
mistakes Publishing a correction is
difficult with YouTube but can certainly
be done we have used Twitter as a source
for example and comments and things like
that and retracting content is of course
another option if it is severe enough to
require a retraction in the case of the
Verge's PC building video it determined
eventually that the the inaccuracies in
the content were severe enough to
retract the video or in the very least
the response and the reputation damage
were severe enough to retract the video
so what matters is how do you deal with
those mistakes when you make them and
this is again something that all of us
have to know how to deal with even
outside of media of course but
especially in media because it does sort
of propagate in a way that is difficult
to to fix so once that information gets
out there if it's wrong so on the verge
there is a statement on the website
there are written guidelines by the
verge by Vox media for what to do when
there is some sort of incorrect
information published
and that guideline states quote Vox
media makes every effort for content to
be completely accurate upon publication
if a correction is required however we
are transparent and will update a story
if new information either adds to or
corrects an aspect of the original story
we will issue corrections for a factual
error or if a typo in the copy could
cause audiences to misunderstand the
story in this instance the verge
disabled its YouTube comments it took
down into their own video and updated
its article with a sort of weak defense
of the content and brushed a bunch of
things under the rug so this is the very
opposite of what we would consider to be
I don't know transparent has the verge
and its guidelines do suggest it tries
to be it's not quite transparent to
other than well I guess transparent and
so far as transparent in its efforts to
try and hide the accidents of the past
and prevent further embarrassment to
itself but rather than follow its own
written guideline what happened here's
Vox media made and the verge every
single bad play in the playbook that
they could make ensuring that nobody
will ever forget this video I mean we
have references to it on one of our
disappointments sure on the 2018
disappointment built shirt for instance
we it's it's there forever so if you
have one you've got a piece in history
maybe they'll send you a copyright claim
in our research on illegitimate claims
here because the verge is sort of
resurfacing this content now in our
research on illegitimate claims which
even YouTube questioned in its response
to Vox media we found a 20-17 article
that states the following of some of
fire watches own copyright claims made
on YouTube quote if the studio knew it
was fair use it could even be punished
for filing a false report the source of
that article was the verge by the way
you might have guessed by now the
company also wrote an article in 2016
that was entitled quote a fine mess how
not to assert your copyright in the
YouTube age where and it encouraged the
fine brothers for releasing illegitimate
Content ID claims on YouTube as a means
to quote
the evil from their public image and
start afresh in that same piece The
Verge wrote that the fine brothers
overreach of trademark and copyright
protectionism could direct quote here
have led to a real suppression of
creativity on YouTube and also set a
horrible precedent for any related
genres of user-generated videos so this
is this is the verge these are quotes
from them we looked up about 10 years of
their articles and they made a lot of ad
money from us to you because I didn't
disable their ad so you're welcome to
bridge but we worked up a lot of their
articles here this is a consistent theme
The Verge and its authors do regularly
make these statements about how this
type of abuse of copyright is a bad
thing I'm paraphrasing there but you get
the idea I mean I just read you a quote
a second ago so pretty clear what what
that author of the verge thought anyway
so it does seem that the verge knew the
precedent that its actions could set
specifically when speaking of the fine
brothers and previously of other content
so this is an abuse of the same system
to file illegitimate claims as the verge
was potentially while actually was
directly criticizing in that previous
article and the verge reinforces itself
to and it's 2016 reports the verge no
surprise noted that Google had been
inundated with over 75 million copyright
takedowns in February of 2016 alone many
of these were legitimate to be
completely fair to the content however
as the author wrote quotes the
ballooning number of requests shows that
copyright holders are still very eager
to leverage the DMCA at every
opportunity and this was also speaking
of music at the time movies things like
that but did briefly mention the the
other type of request here that we're
discussing today so the trouble is that
there are functionally no repercussions
for a company which follows the actions
that Vox media did today it is a company
trying to bully content creators into
removal of their content this is already
something we deal with where companies
try to force us to modify our content we
of course do not stand for that but
it is something that happens behind
closed doors and certainly some content
you've seen somewhere has been at least
partially influenced or modified at the
request of a company taking down a video
can remove it entirely from a site in
the worst case actually in a worst case
than that the content creator receives a
copyright strike as Kyle briefly did you
get a couple of those about three before
you are functionally banned from the
platform and eliminated with your means
of making a living gone in the blink of
an eye and this is a system which is
still somewhat automated there was
manual oversight in the case of Kyle's
issue where he did bring it to YouTube's
attention but this is a it's it's a it's
a serious concern I mean just just think
about going to sleep every night with
the realization that you could wake up
and you've got copyright strikes that
have shut down your channel until you
can get it resolved and in the worst
case you might not be able to get it
resolved you can reference the channel I
hate everything where his channel was
effectively gone overnight although it
was eventually I believe resolved but
that didn't really help things for the
prolonged period of time at which it was
gone
along with all income so this is it's a
problem and really what we're looking at
here is I mean there was let's look at
this there's a pivotal case in 2015 on
fair use which is the issue we're
talking about today the judge took the
side of fair use and wrote to that quote
fair use is not just excused by the law
it is wholly authorized by the law this
is the famous dancing baby case if
you're familiar with that from a couple
years ago so in its analysis of this
decision The Verge wrote in 2015 the
following quote the decision chips away
at the perception that any use of
copyrighted material is probably illegal
setting a higher bar for the copyright
holders and further The Verge wrote that
quote in order to file a takedown notice
copyright holders must have a good faith
belief that someone is using their work
illegally but because the bar for
getting content removed is fairly low
and there are rarely repercussions for
filing obviously incorrect from
Planes this system is open to abuse so
the verge won't have any meaningful
representations YouTube will likely not
act against the verge as we're aware a
YouTube does not in any common case take
away the powers of these copyright
holders which is all of us really but it
to our knowledge YouTube doesn't take
away those powers to file those
copyright claims and maybe in a mid step
this instance YouTube could have some
sort of dulling of those powers I mean
if a company like in this instance Fox
media
- our belief is abusing the ability to
file copyright claims which lead to
strikes and it does so repeatedly and
has a history of doing so and has a
history of losing when YouTube
ultimately reviews the issue and
reverses the removal of the video then
perhaps YouTube could at least consider
making those filing of the copyright
complaints not instantly disabled the
video just maybe pitch it to the creator
first let them respond because I'm 48
hours and then remove the video if the
company that has filed the claim has a
history of abusing the system short of
just completely taking away the powers
although that does seem a bit extreme
because there are valid uses there -
even if they abused it normally so
youtube's probably not going to act
against the verge in any way here we'll
see of course this is opinion this whole
content piece is to be viewed as opinion
or satire in some instances and these
quotes of the content from the verge are
not the heart of the content they are
quotes which have been attributed and if
you would like links to them we can
provide some of those as well do that
below I suppose so if you're watching
The Verge and Vox media hello it's fair
use so I deal with it but otherwise this
is you know it's it's something that
concerned us and to be real here the
verge for all of the silliness in that
video really it did not
deserve an eternity of being criticized
for that video we kind of all got it out
of our systems in the first couple of
weeks there and everyone moved on
there's the occasional reference to
tweezers instead of zip ties but at this
point they're so far removed from that
reference that it's just kind of a funny
joke in the community and now the
Streisand effect as the verge so so
pointedly highlighted is in full effect
because we are all reminded of this
content once again and it's for the
wrong reasons it's out of this weird you
just sort of feel bad for Vox media it's
the company or whoever is over there
controlling this is so embarrassed of
this content that it waited several
months someone over there stood over
this content and how it's embarrassing
them or how they perceive it's
embarrassing them for four months before
acting on anything hoping that probably
no one would notice the opposite in fact
is true we never made a video entirely
dedicated to the verge PC when it first
happened and here we are now talking
about the actually serious legal issues
that are being brought to the forefront
because of the follow-on effect of the
Vox media trying to remove Kyle's
content and if you take USA's content
and who knows who else because they
thought it made them look stupid and the
verge you alone we're responsible for
looking stupid is sheer stupidity you
can't really blame the other guys for
pulling bits and pieces of the video
showing it and then making fun of it
commentating on it through satire
through whatever shows like well comedy
shows that make fun of other networks of
other programs of movies of books of TV
they wouldn't exist if they had the the
same sort of issue we're dealing with
here on YouTube because they're
protected under fair use as we are on
YouTube now because of that 2015 ruling
so anyway it's you know it's it's a bit
different we don't want this to appear
like some sort of YouTube drama video of
any kind
why I didn't really go too hard with
knocking the Virgin this one instead
using their own quotes to highlight the
inanity of it all because I think
honestly the verge through its points
and counterpoint here that we've laid
out on its behalf
does a good job of telling the story and
I don't think we need to count with a
whole lot more so anyway hopefully
hopefully this brought some attention of
the matter to you it is I believe
resolved Kyle seems to be in fine shape
now it looks like YouTube has heard his
side of it and heard the the viewership
on Twitter so we thank you for your
support of the community of course this
affected Kyle directly but it affects
all of us indirectly it is a a concern
of all of ours that you can receive this
type of action illegitimately from
companies that just don't like you and
it can shut things down or in the very
least can remove and censor content for
the period of time in which the content
is relevant you might not get it back up
in time for people to care anymore it
can just disappear so that's that's
ultimately concerned and I don't think
this is uh this is the last you'll hear
about this type of issue so subscribe
for more as always we'll have some
actually good content like benchmark you
know coming up soon I apologize if this
is not the type of content you like from
us I don't particularly like making it
but I do find it very important and this
is my livelihood this is my team's
livelihood we deeply care about what
happens on YouTube as a platform we
deeply care about the politics of
YouTube as a platform and we deeply care
about the legal matters of YouTube and
how it affects our peers in the space
because it will to affect us at a later
date so this is greatly important to us
and I know it's not benchmark content
but I appreciate you hearing me out
because you know I pay people based on
YouTube I pay myself based on YouTube
and we are we can't do this without
YouTube as a platform but to also live
in sort of a fear of what could happen
if the systems of YouTube are abused and
leveraged against you in a way that you
can't respond quickly enough that's
obviously concerning so anyway that's
for now let's go back to the real
content thanks for watching
you can support us through the normal
means patreon.com slash gamers an access
code subscribe to kyle or tweet at them
or something and give them some kind
words and I'll see you all next time
a Swiss Army knife
and it hopefully has ever since Reviver
in it hopefully has it's true Vipers in
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
