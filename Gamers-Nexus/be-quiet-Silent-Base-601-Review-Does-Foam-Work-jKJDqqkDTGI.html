name specifically it's a lowercase B
lowercase Q and exclamation points and
anything else will get you yelled at
they're also very particular about their
cases and that is to focus primarily on
silence there's something we've talked
about a lot in the past and now with the
be quiet silent base 601 we'll be
revisiting the topic of how B quiets
cases performed both thermally and
acoustically which is their primary
selling point we also have a bit of an
interesting discussion to get into
perhaps in a future video at what points
do you hit diminishing returns with
silence to the point where you could
just run a more airflow focused PC with
slower fans before that this video is
brought to you by Thermaltake and the
view 71 enclosure the view 71 is a full
tower case that's capable of fitting
three video cards and most
configurations it's also one of the
better cooling cases in our recent case
testing bench lineup the view 71 has
hinged a tempered glass doors on either
side that make it easy to open and show
off and it comes with at least one rain
fan though you can get the RGB version
if you prefer learn more at the link in
the description below
the entire oh one series from be quiet
is a follow up series so they had the
dark-faced Pro 900 conveniently not
named oh one in that instance it was the
900 Rev 2 but the 601 is a follow up of
the previous 600 and there are a few
updates we talked about that my Computex
when it was in apps but let's go through
the case as it is featured today it's
about 130 bucks on new egg in the US
anyway so that puts it on the lower end
versus what we reviewed the last few
weeks but it is still certainly one of
the more expensive cases the big feature
here for this case is going to be all
the noise damping features we talked
about these and our thermal and acoustic
testing Patrick's build notes coming up
we'll also have more information but
this foam is some of the thickest foam
we've ever seen in a case the way this
stuff works we'll talk about more in a
second but very basics it primarily
helps with high frequency noise so
things like fan whine potentially a
little bit of coil whine whereas the
panel thickness is what will help you
with lower frequency noises so more of
like a lower hum so foam doesn't really
do a whole lot for you there compared to
the higher frequency noise or the one
thing I want to go
back on here and point out is that well
first of all this is mounting procedure
is pretty nice they did a good job on
this with the case where it slots in
which actually has a functional purpose
other than being convenient and it's
because on the backside that extra foam
thickness pushes up against the cable so
hard that if it didn't just hinge in you
would have issues closing it because the
cable is hitting the foam so it actually
is functional but if they don't want to
point out so there's a side panel so no
there's no window in that panel there's
a windowed version of course there's for
everything but you pull this off and
behind the windowless side panel there
is a feature which is purely for
aesthetic purposes that's the power
supply shroud power supply shreds are
made for hiding cables and power
supplies because they're the ugliest
part of your PC you already can't see
the thing you can't see the cables
because there's a steel wall in front of
it so to put a power supply shroud here
really just kind of inhibits the build
process it inhibits air flow in ways
which we have shown previously are
actually important and it's really for
no gain now you might say it looks nicer
but then again I would ask are you
looking at it through that window and if
so can I have your super powers the only
reason you'd really want this thing is
for the tempered glass variant and
that's fine
if you want it that's a subjective thing
we're not gonna argue with you that's
that's totally up to you with the
tempered glass panel however keep in
mind that you lose the foam so you do
lose I mean it's got let's see foam on
all panels so you lose maybe 15-20
percent of the foam on the case a
silence focused case in the most
actually more than that because if
you're just going by panel size it's
quite significant it's probably closer
to 40 percent of the foam just for a
window and I guess at that point I our
suggestion would be to look at what you
want in a case and then evaluate other
options on the market because it is kind
of missing the point on this one
but anyway 130 bucks is the case with
the steel panel at least there's
windowed version insides pretty standard
be quiet is efficient in
using tooling and they've done that
again here in some areas so the case is
fairly familiar and I guess we can talk
through the rest of it and Patricks
build notes before getting through the
thermals noise and the conclusion also
note one more thing that's pretty
important for the thermal section here
there are two fans and they are the pure
wings to 140 millimeter fans there's one
of the front one of the rear and the one
in the front is the important one that
one is positioned pretty low in the case
it's right on top of the power supply
shroud so almost all of its air is going
to be pulled by the GPU by the video
card before the CPU can ever get access
to it and the CPU fan really can't hope
to fight the pressure of the video card
fans that are so close to that front
intake so keep that in mind that means
the CPU thermals will be higher in the
stock configuration than the GPU thermal
is comparatively the 601 comes with
orange black or silver trim and is sold
with either one steel one glass panel or
two identical panels we prefer the non
windowed variety which is what we
received for review the major selling
points of B quiets cases is silence
achieved in part with a heavy layer of
noise damping foam on the case panels
and if that accomplishes anything at all
then replacing half of it with glass
won't help because it's not like we're
putting the foam on the glass the foam
is one centimeter thick it's shaped into
tiny noise baffles and it fully covers
the inner surfaces of the front the top
and the sides of the case the attention
to detail on where the foam goes is
pretty extensive the concept of noise
damping foam is based on basic science
with a lot of small divots in the
material the higher frequency sound
waves can bounce around within the foam
indents and lose energy this
theoretically reduces noise escaping the
case but primarily changes the type of
noise to reduce shorter wavelength
exposure to the user long wavelength
exposure remains largely unaffected by
foam like this and is more affected by
thickness of material like thicker
aluminum or steel paneling visually the
601 is similar to the rest of be quite
scaled corners and angular strips of
trim but they don't appear to be reusing
old parts given how elaborate B quiets
cases usually
are with invertible layouts and
removable hard drive bays and rubber
grommets crammed in everywhere it's
impressive how low be quiet keeps cost
on the silent base and pure baselines
considering the rest of the features
obviously some parts like the hard drive
bays are shared and they only have a few
case models in production at any given
time but it's sort of bizarre in this
respect that buying arisin tech affion
and adding to pure wins - fans - it
would cost about as much as the 601 des
with larger versions of those fans
already installed this speaks partially
to efficiency of men maxing the tooling
presently deployed something that be
quiet does well and deoxys aged 700 I
introduced a quick button ejection
system for side panels that we found
clever and intuitive and it looks like
be quiet is trying to do something
similar
the silent based 601 implements this on
both side panels even in the windowed
version of the case which is a notable
improvement over the thumb screws used
in the company's own dark based Pro 900
pressing the buttons to release the
panel's allows them to hinge out just
enough so they can be pulled upwards
that keeps the panels from flopping out
and onto the floor but the natural
instinct is still to try and pull the
panel's out rather than up so keep this
in mind it's still kind of a novelty but
it serves more of a purpose for be quiet
than it would for other manufacturers
because of that thick noise damping foam
with normal side panels it can be
difficult to get the cables and foam to
all squeeze together enough to slide
them into place and this installation
practice helps offset that there's no
magnetic front door like the one on the
dark bass 900 but the metal cover over
the front filter does easily slide up
and out the bottom filter ejects from
the front of the case rather than the
back which is always a welcome feature
other small quality-of-life features
that deserve note or praise are the
removable power supply frame and a top
fan radiator mount that slides out from
the side this mounts is particularly
nice and it's possible to slide it out
partially install a radiator and not
need to take the whole thing out of the
case the fan controller is three speed
and can handle up to three fans like the
dark bass 700 the 601 grams the
controller switch into a former USB port
in the front panel we tend to not use
fan controllers if we can avoid it so we
this simple and unobtrusive controller
to the fancier one found in the dark
Bass Pro 900 it's difficult for case
fans to move air through tight spaces
and right angles and we criticize cases
that carelessly ignore this the key
there is carelessly ignore this with the
silent based 601 it's intentional it's
part of the design and it trades ease of
cooling for silence instead these also
included in the thermal section later in
this review but it doesn't take a genius
to figure out that the 600 ones front
panel is more restrictive than something
like the mesh of I see we draw the line
of distinction at marketing this case
isn't marketed as a high airflow case
does not promise to be the coolest case
on the market and instead it markets
silence these two features are often at
odds with be quiet choosing its namesake
feature over cooling cable management
space is limited there's about three
centimeters at best but the foam and
grommets and various bits of metal
Hardware cut into that the one
centimeter thick foam is soft so it's
technically possible to squeeze in more
but that risks leaving permanent dents
in the foam if that's something you care
about we'd recommend removing the hard
drive cage and using the extra room
inside the power supply shroud for
cables and if you need one use be quiet
free-floating hard drive bays instead
only one is included with the 601 but
it's the same kind that the other be
quiet cases use and extras are available
for ten dollars up to five of these can
fit in the case we're not really big
fans of DLC add-ons or cases as we've
said in the past
be quiet does include a sufficient
amount of hard drive mounting support
stock it's just it's not where we want
it the trouble is that it's in places
we'd rather leave open for cables given
how tight the paneling is here
moving on to thermals and noise the big
one being noise for this towards the end
of the charts stock configuration for
the 601 is too pure wanes to 140
millimeter fans one in rear exhaust and
one in front intake just above the power
splash route both plugged into the
motherboard and set to max speed
additional tests were done with no front
panel orienting the GPU vertically and
using the fan controller at minimum
speed the vertical GB amount has clearly
only intended to be used with the
windowed version of the case and there's
less clearance in our version thanks to
the foam so performance is worse than it
would be with a window remove the front
here means that the metal cover is taken
off of the front but we leave the filter
and the rest of the panel in place so
time to get into the charts we're
starting with just a bunch of be quiet
cases and then we'll move on to
comparative testing between competitors
for the stock silent basic so on average
CPU temperature during torture testing
was sixty point five degrees Celsius
over ambient using the fan controller to
lower the speed to level one raise
thermals to 72 point nine degrees over
ambiens which is obviously a very poor
use case these results illustrate that
you really should only be using these
low-speed settings where idle or
browsing type work not for gaming or
heavy loads this is illustrated by all
the other be quiet devices with lowest
fan speeds - including the dark base 700
for the sine base 601 removing the front
panel lower the temperature to 54 point
one degrees over ambiens the front panel
obstructs an airflow heavily but it's
also clear that the fan is still able to
effectively cool at matok speed even
with the obstruction now I'm seeing the
GPU vertically raise the temperature a
couple of degrees from baseline but that
test has more relevance to the GPU
Thermal section the baseline sixty-two
point five degree temperature is one of
the warmest on the chart when we look
comparatively at other cases right
around the Antec PA and performance for
reference we previously described the
antique p8 as having the cooling
capacity of a toaster so this isn't a
good part of the chart to occupy the
dark base pro 900 is delta-t result was
about four degrees lower but it is a
larger case with more breathing room and
more fans even 54.1 degrees Celsius
without the front panel cover isn't
terribly low just about on par with
these stock mesh of IC the single intake
fan has a much more directly at the GPU
than the CPU cooler when looking at the
silent basics or one more closely so
that's where all of our air is going
we'll have to look at GPU performance
results to prove that really competitive
cooling in this case would require two
or more fans added to it but that would
also generate more noise beginning to
negate these silenced focus of the case
so it's a difficult to spot to be in we
need to look at some more numbers
including noise numbers before we reach
anything conclusive be quiet can't be
things too hard for being warm when the
entire goal is silence not cooling
moving onto the GPU test with just be
quiet cases for now G via thermal
average fifty two point eight degrees
Celsius over amides and the SB 601 is
torture test this was lowered a few
degrees to forty nine point
degrees Celsius delta T by removing the
front panel raised to 57 point seven
degrees by lowering the case fan speed
and raised again to sixty two point two
degrees up by mounting the GV vertically
Mountain AEG be vertically flush with
the side panel while always worse and
cooling and there's absolutely no reason
to do it in a case with no window with
the window reserve it for open-loop
solutions comparatively fifty two point
eight degrees delta T over ambiens is a
bit below the center of the charge
actually below the other be quiet cases
we've tested and closer to the Corsair
270 yarn performance it's not impressive
but we still have noise look forward to
that'll be at the end and this is a
major opportunity for redemption of
performance fire strike extreme stress
testing raised GPU temperature to fifty
five point three degrees Celsius over
ambiens a more mediocre rank than in the
torture test but still not bad that's on
the same level as the Silverstone klo 7
and PMO two too intensely forgettable
cases it's also better than the dark
bass pro 900 but not nearly as good as
the revision two of that case the silent
bass 601 CPU thermals and fires rec are
remarkably high up there with recent SL
600 M testing where the CPU is largely
compartmentalized and isolated by a wall
of GPU below it CPU temperature and
blender C be rendering test was 41 point
five degrees over ambience one of the
warmest temperatures on the chart like
the torture test results this is
equivalent to the Antec p8 and not
distant from the BitFenix and so despite
a science focus high-end machines with
air coolers would benefit from an
additional fan or from a brute force at
liquid cooling approach GPO temperature
in the blender GB render tasks with
twenty five point six degrees Celsius
another decent DB result on the same
level as the H five heavy mesh and stock
eight seven hundred I be quiet get some
redemption here ranking in the upper
half of performance in the blender GPU
test as a reminder this happens largely
because that front fan is centered on
the GPU benefitting it tremendously
noise suppression is the main attraction
here and the silent base 601 delivers we
measured it at 36 DBA with the fans at
maximum speed which is where most of
those thermal results were recorded that
puts the silent basic so on at around
the s2 the land cold one and the defined
see an acoustic performance always
measured at thirty two point eight DBA
with the fan speed minimized via the
controller the max annoys level is
comparable to the Lanco one or dark bass
100 at the level 3 setting while the
minimum is closer to the dark Bass Pro
900 minimum noise level note again that
the minimum setting it's really only
suitable for low load work the case
overall it's really good build quality
so definitely be quiet on a good job
just in terms of the construction the
hinged doors with the button for
ejection is really nice it's something
that NZXT did on their cases previously
we liked it there we liked here so build
quality overall job well done by be
quiet and this is I mean you can even
just look at attention to detail so for
example the fans every screw for each of
the fans has a rubber o-ring or washer
basically between the screw and the case
and that's to help with small vibrations
that you might get from the fan motor
it's a really small piece of Intel that
a lot of case manufacturers don't care
about miss don't think it's important
whatever but the point is be quiet does
get this one every time and be quiet
also goes through and hits basically
everything else that they can think of
that might cause vibration that might
have a slight gap in it where noise can
escape except for this one weird random
hole in the back but they do a good job
as a company of really paying attention
to those finer noise details that you
kind of look at it it's like a rubber
train around a screw okay what does that
really do for me but it's really a sum
of the parts in this case that makes for
a better enclosure and use the word case
twice so they've done well over build
quality competitively it's a rough
market right now 130 bucks puts be quiet
up against a whole lot of good options
that we had on our chart so depending on
what you're looking for if you're
looking for exactly this something
that's extremely silence focused and you
can maybe afford to budget for another
fan in the front you'll do pretty well
for it this really does deserve an
additional fan on the front we think so
that the CPU can get some air as well
the CPU gets air from another top
mounted or front mounted in the top fan
then both components will be acceptable
they're not gonna be great they won't
beat open front cases but they'll be
acceptable if your goal is silence the
next question is well okay but if I just
buy a case with a more open front panel
and then spin down the fan rpm into a
coil
noise and match the DBA output or the
DBA measurement at what point am I then
getting superior cooling for the same
noise level not something we're
investigating for sever piece because
it's an interesting question and and
we're glad you didn't ask but that's it
for this case I mean one hundred thirty
bucks it's fine build quality is good
thermal performance on the GPU is
acceptable thermal performance on the
CPU is not good but if you buy an extra
fan for the top in that front panel it's
fine
or will be fine it's just stock it it
does not fare too well for sustained
render loads on the CPU or sustained
workload on the CPU just get that extra
fan in there because it will be a bit
hot you could brute-force it with the
CLC but relative to the CLC in other
cases it will of course they'll be
hotter so I guess that's it for this one
alternatives we will link in the article
