480 news to do before we start winding
down this coverage i assure you we're
looking at other content coming up very
shortly but we do have more to talk
about with the RX 41st and the first
item is some of the AIB partner
aftermarket models of this reference
card this is the one that AMD provided
and now asus and sapphire have announced
and shown their new models we haven't
gotten any information from the other
board partners as of yet this coverage
is brought to you by origin pc and a new
origin chronos gaming PC with the RX 480
is customizable upgradable and ready for
VR asus has their Strix are x 480 these
tricks are x4 ID is the direct CU 3
cooler the direct CU 3 cooler looks like
what's on the screen it's got three fans
and it uses a sort of standard heat pipe
design with an aluminum heatsink the
heat pipe is copper it's 10 millimeters
goes into a cold plate and there is of
course other heat pipes in there as well
that's got an aluminum heatsink attached
to it there's an aura RGB effect this is
a Seuss's version of RGB LEDs they
backlight the faceplate of the card and
then there is a back plate on the card
as well which she kind of want for
structural integrity there's additional
support since it is a larger card in
addition to this the marketing text for
this a csr x480 Strix says the direct CU
3 cooler has triple wing blade 0 DB fan
designs with an exclusive asu's auto
extreme technology with super alloy
power to for premium quality and best
reliability so basically it's got a
copper and aluminum cooler with some
fans on it the next card is the sapphire
nitro r x 480 this one is using a dual
fan controller rather than 3 it will be
closer to this size actually not it may
be smaller but i'm not sure just yet
because if you look at the back of this
the board is actually smaller than the
cooler so sapphires is the Nitro design
cooler that is a more affordable bracket
for sapphire it will be priced at 250
British pounds just based on what
overclockers UK has stated but i'm not
sure what the US
price will be the cooler does have a
back plate attached to it and that it's
normal again heat pipe design with two
fans or the cool things here the fans
can be removed pretty easily that is for
cleaning purposes to get the dust out
it's got a button on the back plate to
toggle or switch through the LED
lighting modes and finally it has and
this is the most important one 8-pin
connector rather than the six pin on
reference and that eight pin power
header now eight pins it's just two
extra pins over six and those two pins
provide extra grounding that said they
are rated for 150 watts where the six
pin is rated for 75 watts so that should
resolve some the PCIe bus stuff if it
siphons more power from the power supply
directly and also potentially give extra
room for overclocking but we will see
how that goes so that's all for this
quick roundup of the two cards currently
announced as always we'll be following
this stuff as it comes out along with a
couple of other products we use coming
up this week so links in the description
