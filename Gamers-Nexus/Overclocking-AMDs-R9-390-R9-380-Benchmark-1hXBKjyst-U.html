and today we're talking about the r9 390
and r9 380 I know it's old news now that
the fury X is out and speaking of which
we've got to fury axes here on the table
as stand-ins because I had to send the
390 and 380 back as part of our reviewer
agreement with sapphire so we're doing a
retro look I already overclocked 390 and
380 it's already on the website but
haven't published it yet and that's what
we're looking at today for for video
format of the overclocking and
procedures for the 390 and 380 it's
pretty easy we basically use AMD's
overdrive at the time of review which
was when these cards launched there were
no proper tools available for for over
volting there's only and these overdrive
which allows overclocking of the core
clock the memory clock and the power
percent target increase which is the
same as Maxwell's power percent increase
he basically just increased the percent
power allowance over TDP over talking
the video cards will impact a few things
were mostly changing the memory and core
clock the power percent increase allows
these jumps in the clock rates but
doesn't really change watch house the
obviously draws a bit more power but
that's sort of the end of the story
there and the base power is to 75 watts
for the 390 the r9 390 so that's TDP and
the 380 is 190 watts which is actually a
slight improvement over the 280 both of
these cards are refresh is of the 200
series
so the 285 would be one of them the 290
and I'm using the word refresh because a
little bit different than a rebadged
with a refresh andy has taken the same
architecture and slightly improved it by
doing a few things like overclocking it
by an extra 50 megahertz and things like
that and because of this overclock
there's not a lot of room for us to
further overclock it because they've
already done it factory to really the
level that the sort of old architecture
will allow at this point overclocking
the core clock will impact the texture
fill rate which is a product of the TM
use the texture mapping units and the
core clock you multiply them to get the
texture fill rate and then it also just
generally speeds things up a bit
overclock from the memory speeds up
memory transactions so this actually
have a slight impact on the non HBM
cards and that's worth noting here only
the fury X is HBM right now high
bandwidth memory so the 390 and 380 that
we looked at a couple weeks ago when I
did this overclocking test we're on the
more traditional gddr5 this chart shows
the performance output gained by the
small over clocks that were done so what
you're looking at is the increment for
each overclock and you see them in steps
and they're performed with two tests
there is a short pass basically five
minutes does it work and then there's an
endurance test that's 25 minutes to see
if it actually survives in the long term
when playing a game you can see that we
increase the power percent target by the
maximum 20% allowed for the r9 380 and
50% for the r9 390 and the clock rate of
the 380 we were able to get a total
overclock of 8.4 percent which is
certainly not huge and the overclock for
the 93 98 point 5 percent any more than
this and we suddenly exhibited
instability which in this instance is
described as red flickering and textures
flickering artifacting visually and then
eventually a driver failure if you go
too far over the line so that's where
our limiter was with these tests whether
or not this impact performance is really
shown in these charts and and it's kind
of questionable whether it's worth your
time so for the 390 and 380 overclocked
looking at the benchmark charts the FPS
you see about a 1 to 7 percent framerate
gain frame rates per second for the AMD
cards when overclocked and again this is
because they've already eked out as much
as possible in terms of the core clock
for the new series over the existing
architecture on the old series so at
best you get 7 percent in our testing
eyes maybe 8 percent at Absolute Max and
your increase increasing the power draw
increasing the abuse on the GPU itself
so whether that trade-off is worth 4 to
5 frames per second is really somewhat
questionable I certainly wouldn't do it
but if you'd like to it's not hard it's
very easy with and these overdrive
utility
there are tools that exist with voltage
changes as well I haven't used any of
them for the 300 series because we don't
have 300 cards anymore but that's where
the results live for the AMD 300 series
overclocking to items that are worth
notes the power draw increase I've
gotten this chart as well is under 20
watts additional for system peak load
for both of these cards when overclocked
so not a huge power draw game but
they're pretty high at the the 275 and
190 watt range anyway so you do get a
bit more draw out of that when
overclocked and then for the
temperatures these sapphire coolers are
actually again very impressive this was
the thing I was most impressed with when
I benchmarked and reviewed the 393 a
week or two ago was the sapphire cooler
and in this case we can see if they're
effectively the same temperature with
the overclock and a lot of that is
because the the fans will increase their
speed based on demand of the GPU they're
trying to keep it at a certain
temperature and in this case it's about
45 Celsius delta T which is 60 65 66
absolute temperature overall the
overclocking experience with the 390 and
380 feels somewhat pointless we only get
one to 7% frame rate increase which in
the real world translates to maybe 5
frames per second increase so if you're
playing a game and you're borderline 60
55 to 60 you're really not going to
notice for the most part you'll see a
tear every now and then but it's it's
certainly not in my view worth the added
abuse to the card it's definitely
something I would recommend try and if
you have a MD devices it's certainly
worth playing around with to learn about
overclocking but I wouldn't push it at
the absolute maximum power percent
target and core clock for long periods
of time because it does wear down the
GPU and this isn't just a MD I'm talking
about this is anything this is Intel
CPUs AMD CPUs and videos GPUs any kind
of overclocking
does add abuse to the chip especially if
you're over bolting it can kill it early
it decreases the longevity of the
silicon die in there and compared to the
gtx 980ti that i reviewed recently
though we're talking for the 300 series
is is certainly a bit lower it's not as
exciting the gtx 980ti
about a 40% clock rate gain which is a
noteworthy performance gain when
overclocked and the 980ti hybrid which
is the liquid cooled one can overclock
even higher than reference because it's
on a liquid and that's that's a lot of
room to play with that gets to be fairly
substantial in your frame rate as
indicated by the 980ti hybrid
outperforming the Titan X which is a
much more expensive card by a couple
hundred dollars so in that instance
overclocking is worth it but you still
have these same warnings in place and
the same concerns of damaging longevity
of the chip for the 390 and 380 it's not
really too worth it unless you just want
to play around the fury X is what we're
targeting next so do stay tuned for that
