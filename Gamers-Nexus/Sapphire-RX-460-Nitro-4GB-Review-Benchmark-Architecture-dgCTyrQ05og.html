company's Polaris lineup this time with
Polaris 11 the lower-end GPU the RX 460
has an MSRP of $110 but we'll see how
that sticks obviously through they have
you partner models as they roll out this
is not a reference card so there will
only be partner models and we don't know
what the four and two gigabyte prices
will shake out to be just yet but $110
is the recommended price from AMD the
card we're testing is the sapphire RX
460 nitro and it is pre overclocked
we'll talk with that in a moment in
terms of testing we've added overwatch
and dota 2 to our test bench
specifically for this card it's a
limited run of cards on those two games
but it will give a better idea of
performance with the lower end games on
the screen now is the spec stable for
the latest cards the rx 460 is pretty
stripped down compared to the RX 470 and
480 his block diagram is on the screen
now the RX 480 and 470 is a Polaris 10
GPU with the 470 removing forces and
drop into 32 from 36 on the 480 and the
RX 460 block diagram which is now on the
screen shows the cards 14 see us and 896
stream processors the architecture is
similar to previous chips we reviewed
and we're still working with fourth gen
GC ncu layout so that's all the same and
still running 64 cores per Cu with 4 TM
use per see you learn more about the
architecture discussion in the article
linked in the description below or we
have the review and go into greater
depth as for top-level specs we're
looking at an AMD recommended clock rate
of twelve hundred megahertz boost but
there won't be a reference model so it's
just partner decisions on the actual
final clock rate the card will also ship
in two and four gigabyte variants and
we're not sure on the pricing of those
at the time of filming but those prices
will be added to the article again once
that goes live and our model here is a 4
gigabyte nitro which is pre overclocked
to 1250 mega Hertz from 1200 recommended
and that's with a dual fan push cooler
let's dive straight in the test bench is
on the screen now and test methodology
can be viewed on the website for full
depth and drivers used we're starting
with thermals which we actively measure
ambient and create delta values for and
you can see why with these screenshots
endurance shows non delta readings but
the rest is all Delta values here's a
look at peak average load
amateurs and idle temperatures the
Sapphire rx 460 nitro operates warm as a
result of its low fan rpm and that's
mostly for silence reasons
sapphires nitro also the 460 operates at
51 Celsius delta T over ambient though
maintains a low idle by nature of the
low power consumption of the Polaris 11
chip the RX 470 from sapphire the
Platinum Edition which is a reference
are X 480 cooler sits at 53 Celsius
delta T but is thermally throttling at
that point and runs a higher fan rpm
hence the difference we discuss both of
these in our review of the 470 and then
again in the teardown of the card if you
want to learn more about how that fan
works and things like that
here's a quick look at temperature over
time this chart reveals the per second
performance of the cards though the data
is the same as the previous charts it's
just been plotted against another axis
moving to endurance tests we see the rx
416 by TroKar maintains a fairly flat
clock rate which is ideal and that means
that the clock is hitting and sticking
to its 12 50 megahertz target and the
temperatures fluctuate only within a
range of about 72 to 75 Celsius and
these by the way our diode values not
Delta values the clock rate is properly
stable with this variant of the rx 460
and is more than we can say for any of
the reference cards from the GPU
manufacturers out including the 480 and
the GTX bounders edition cards the RX
460 is a low enough power chip that is
able to carry reduced fan speed in favor
of thermals with the nitro cooler and
the fan spins at around a thousand to
1,200 rpm during most testing but we
unfortunately cannot plot the per second
fan speed at this time because the
software doesn't measure it just yet
moving on to power tests we test power
draw at the wall so this is total system
power draw using the same bench but with
different cards not a per card power
draw test the RX 460 nitro operates at
169 volt amps when loaded 100% with an
idle output of 73 volt amps that places
us between the gtx 750ti first gen
maxwell card and the gtx at 9:50 second
gen maxwell card the RX 460 operates
well below the arch for 70's systems
power drop by the way at 222 volt amps
versus again the four sixties of 169
both hands moving on to game
benchmarking again the method
in the description below and that's
where you'll find driver information
things like that
we did have some driver issues with some
of the latest AMD updates 1673
particularly and 16.8 dot one also is
not free of issues but we'll talk about
that towards the end overwatch is an
interesting title to benchmark mostly
because it's got some quirks in its
graphics menu restarting the game will
occasionally reset some of the settings
not sure what triggers that and the game
also does not equally apply its preset
graphics across all advanced settings
for all hardware configurations for
example a gtx 750ti will receive lower
settings with the preset ultra than a
gtx 950 even though you're still
choosing ultra on both so the game is
dynamically scaling its graphics
settings even though all those options
are still available and this means that
anyone testing overwatch and playing it
for that matter should ensure due
diligence by clicking the Advanced tab
and identifying that the settings are
equal across all the tested hardware so
if you're trying to validate your own
gaming performance versus ours do that
and make sure the settings on the screen
that we have now match yours note this
was also a small task compared to the
other hardware configs as we're just
adding overwatch for low-end cards at
1080p with our ultra settings the ones
we configured by hand anyway we're
seeing an output of about 67 FPS average
on the sapphire rx 460 nitro card with a
53 fps one resent low in 52 0.1% low the
lows are fairly tightly times an
overwatch and produce note noticeable
stutters during our testing
comparatively the 2013 r9 270x reference
card with stock clocks is performing at
73 FPS average 57 low and 55 0.1% lows
to refresh everyone's memory that card
sat in about the 150 dollar price range
the majority of its life and above that
is ranked the gtx 950 Strix version of
the card with 2 gigabytes of vram and
that sells about 160 dollars before
rebates and that card is performing at
80 3.7 FPS average and maintain sixty
seven and sixty four point seven lows at
the bottom of the stack is the gtx 750ti
SC with two gigabytes of vram performing
close to the RX 460 and that's a 4.7
percent change from the 750 Ti to the rx
460 and here's the the depiction of
percent change by the way with the rx
460 as the bay
zero percent and you can just use this
for reference of where they perform just
for further reference we were hitting 42
FPS average an overwatch one at 1440p
with the RX 460 not bad and if you
dropped settings kind of hard you could
play in your 60fps with 1440p let's move
on to dota 2 our settings for this game
are shown on the screen as well read the
review link below for more information
dota 2 isn't that demanding we were
hitting 189 PS average on the RX 460
nitro with a 75 FPS 1% low and 50 0.1%
low for comparison the r9 270x performed
about equally at 120 points 7 FPS
average and about the same low as the
gtx 950 Strix operates at 1 45.7 average
with a consistently lower 1% low though
negligible to actual gameplay and nearly
a 50 for FPS 0.1% low the bottom of the
stack again contains the gtx 750ti which
is about $100 these days and that's at
109 FPS average and plants the RX for
68% ahead of the gtx 750ti old to new
and here's another percent change chart
for ease for reading that information as
that's on the screen the note that we're
hitting 79 FPS average with 40 FPS 1%
low as I'm thirty two point three FPS
0.1% lows with the rx 460 at 1440p using
the same ultra settings let's move on to
our normal test suite looking at doom
with OpenGL first we see the rx 460
nitro at 45 FPS average with 1080p ultra
settings large for 74 comparison push is
about 76 FPS average with the 480 at 85
average Nvidia's GTX 1060 F II runs at
98.3 FPS average and let's look now at
how Vulcan impacts that performance with
Vulcan enabled we're operating at fifty
six point eight FPS average on the rx
460 and it was playable before but is
now more fluid with a 12 FPS gain and
the rx 470 and 480 are outpacing a stock
GTX 1060 reference card you can view our
470 and 1060 reviews if these numbers
interest you switching over to 1440p
with OpenGL only the rx 460 operates at
twenty eight point seven FPS average not
really playable especially considering
the low values and the rx where 70
remains fairly playable at 1440p
volcán doesn't help too much though
does rhe
if some of the workload when we look at
these charts by shifting us up to 30 4.6
FPS average on the RX 460 and the RX 470
is now in excess of 60 FPS average of
course the 460 is not really meant for
1440p either though it can handle the
resolution with some games like dota 2
and sort of overwatch called duty black
ops 3 is one of the best optimized
titles on the bench with regard to
graphics and framerate hit and we test
with high settings so there's room to
increase graphics options of performance
allows at 1080p high the rx 460 outputs
about 65 FPS average with 54 and 51 fps
low is more or less the r9 380 X
operates at 94 fps or a percent change
of 45% from the 460 and 380 X and we
decided to test on 1440p with the same
settings out of curiosity 460 performs
at 39 FPS at 1440p certainly not ideal
but really not bad considering the price
of the card and let's talk about this
for a second this is a card that's
priced in theory at 110 dollars I'm a
Sharpie if it sticks and that's pushing
40 FPS average at 1440p the same could
be said for the 470 480 from AMD or the
10 16 1070 from Nvidia this generation
of cards from both vendors has clearly
made 1440p a real possibility for play
and the high-end cards previously we're
hitting about these frame rates so we're
really past that point now and that
should shape your future monitor
purchases GTA 5 at 1080p with very high
in ultra settings operates at 44 FPS
average with lows that dip below 30 fps
planting it above the 750ti and below
the r9 270x and 380 X large 460 would be
capable of playing GTA 5 if you dip
settings down too high but the rank in
between cars remains linear across the
board so you can extrapolate performance
from this chart you can view more FPS
charts on the website link in the
description below
and those include Metro last light
Mordor ashes of the singularity Mirror's
Edge catalyst and some additional
thermal information overclocked in the
RX 460 is the same as the 470 and 480 we
use wot man for that because no
aftermarket software is available as of
yet and you can see our clock stepping
and progression on the screen now our
clock rate settled at about thirteen
hundred megahertz with an 1800 megahertz
memory overclock using maxed out V core
at 11:15
note that measurement software is fairly
infantile at this point so we don't have
a good way to check chip power draw
until software updates at least not
consistently and note also that memory
clock is restricted to a 50 megahertz OC
which seems to have been instated with
16.7 3 onward and the next drivers may
resolve this from what Andy has told us
the overclock puts us about 50 megahertz
over the pre overclock from sapphire or
nearly a hundred megahertz off of the
reference clock rate recommendation from
AMD and here's a look at the frame rate
differences we're not seeing much of a
performance jump on average from 1250 to
$12.99 a megahertz the overclock
generally about one maybe two fps or a
couple of percentage points maximum a
quick note on drivers before the
conclusion we had serious issues with
the drivers for this card it's similar
to what we saw on 60 not 7.3 that we
reported on a separate video and 16.8
dot one those issues seem to stem from
the sixteen seven three update it's
probably built on the same package so
that makes sense the drivers hard crash
and create sort of colored screen output
screen Orange whatever random color
occasional blue screens black screens
basically dyes we had issues with the
card recovering from a display sleep so
if the display turns itself off for
power saving we had issues where it
would just be black and not come back on
without a restart there's also the
restriction on memory overclocked though
Andy did tell us that that should be
removed in the next update and after
testing on three different benches we
finally figured out that to say when
Andy shader cash and reverting to use
application settings as the option
within the drivers fixes most of these
issues at least temporarily or works
around them or whatever you want to use
luckily we already test this way but it
did take hours to figure out and can
only really be done by getting lucky
enough and avoiding a hey mod enough to
make the change before it crashes anyway
Andy told us that there's a fix rolling
out for some of these issues at least so
we'll keep an eye on that and let you
know if it changes the rx 460 is
positioned in a somewhat uncontested
market right now sort of like the 470
was until its pricing was higher than we
were told anyway at least for this model
but the 460 even though it's uncontested
in it's sort of $100 market and why I
say uncontested I mean very specifically
for current as a new generation
architecture the position is weird
because if you have something like a two
70 X or a 750ti this is really not an
upgrade or not much of one from the
750ti and actually downgrade from the
270 X so you have one of those cards
this is off your list already you should
be looking at a higher skew what it's
really targeted toward is something like
a new system build where you don't have
anything you're not upgrading and that
makes the rx 460 tougher to justify than
the rx 470 480 and gtx 1060 cards on
average it's an underperformed by design
the Polaris 11 chip is pretty weak it's
about 2 2.2 teraflops
and it's even beaten by 2 gigabyte gtx
950 s as the 4 gigabyte v Ram will
commonly choke on wraps or cores or
something else before choking on its
memory capacity the gtx 950 is priced a
bit higher than the RX 460 MSRP the
board partners will be all over the map
as usual so we will really just have to
wait and see how the pricing shakes out
ultimately Polaris 11 is sort of meant
to be a laptop chip that's something
we've talked about a bit now and it
makes more sense in something like a
notebook where you can't have the higher
power draw of some of the other chips
and it's not producing as much heat so
the thermal solutions on it is difficult
to design so it kind of makes sense
maybe there but we'll test that once
it's in laptops if we get one as a video
card the performance isn't really that
acceptable to me I especially with the
driver issues we encountered that those
will probably be fixed so it may be
scrub that a little bit and see how it
comes out in our future update videos
but as a video card standalone in a
vacuum of drivers that are a non-issue
it still makes more sense to get an rx
470 if you can afford it and it's less
than $200 I'd watch our other video for
why it doesn't make sense more than that
a gtx 1060 or 480 if you're pushing
pretty far into the 250 plus price range
and that is a really big push or if
you're trying to stay below 200 and the
470 is a non option or it's a little too
expensive you can drop down to about 150
$140 and do something like a gtx 950 i
know it's last gen but there's no 1050
to replace it right now and it's still a
better performing than this upwards of
25% in some cases and it's about the
same price as probably some of the board
partner models will be or if you want
AMD the r9 380
is also generally fluctuating between
152 these days less than 170 bucks on
average depending where you look and
that's also a card that's a better
performer than this one is so both of
those even though the last gen it's not
really that old of an architecture it's
still fairly new and they're better
performers and they're not far in price
and they'll be in stock so that's where
I would push most users if you're a
really strict budget maybe this can work
if you really can't stretch the extra
twenty thirty dollars whatever it may be
for something better but I would try to
do that honestly depending on what
you're doing so we'll see where board
partners shake out other prices
recommendations one hundred ten dollars
I'm assuming some of the four gigabyte
bottles will be encroaching on $150.00
territory but article in the description
below for the actual final prices when
we do have those will update their
retailers will be dumping stock the
older cards so if you're again at a
budget that's the place to look as
