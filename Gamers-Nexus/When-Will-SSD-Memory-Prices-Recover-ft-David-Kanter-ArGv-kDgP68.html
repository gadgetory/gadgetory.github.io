Cantor of real-world techcom we have
another video that should be up by now
talking about what is a coup de coeur
and does it exist it's a bit of an
existential question that's right and
that one now we're gonna be talking
about the the memory and flash market
before that this video is brought to you
by thermal takes view 37 case the view
37 focuses on highlighting custom PC
builds with its full panoramic window
and tinted front acrylic and our thermal
testing the view 37 performed reasonably
well when considering its looks focus
build which is partly thanks to the
airflow design and the removal of a
bottom power supply shroud for a balance
of looks and performance check the link
in the description below for the view 37
so David works as an analyst I guess is
accurate right for a descriptor I spend
time analyzing things you know and but
you know when it comes to computing you
know obviously I pay a lot of attention
to CPUs to GPUs right but at the end of
the day we also need to you know the
phrase is always feed the beast right
we've got to get the memory we've got to
get the storage and got to bring it all
together and so you known and is
something that is undergoing a bit of a
revolution and so what we're seeing in
terms of the shortage of NAND is more of
a consequence of that and so for a long
time the basic NAND cell was shrunk at
every generation and so the the problem
we ran into is eventually it got to be
there weren't a large number of
electrons representing each bit you know
you might have 10 20 50 100 and it got
to the point where the statistics of
something going wrong made it very
difficult to scale and so the the
industry decided that they would go in
3d in the third dimension just sort of
like with FinFETs right where we went
for vertical transit riders to get
better control same sort of deal and so
we have this new 3d NAND and the rough
idea is that you take rather than having
a really small planner so you make a
bigger planner cell
but then you drop 24 32 64 96 of them on
top of another right exactly and so you
know Samsung was really the first guys
to do a lot of research on this they do
64 layer is that what they're up to now
yeah so right now everyone's doing 64
layer and that's pretty economical and
the real challenge is that you know of
course the first time you do anything
you don't do it quite as well right as
it could be and so there's some scaling
that needs to happen is you get
experience with these things and so the
early 32 layer that Samsung did was not
cost competitive with planner NAND and
so the problem is you had this situation
where every one you know Intel my Intel
and micron Samsung Hynix and Toshiba and
SanDisk you know needed to make some
investment decisions about what kind of
factories are they gonna go right and
everyone knew that 32 layer was not
quite gonna work out but it had better
reliability better endurance and so
Samsung was selling it into like
datacenter applications and ultimately
this plays back into price and things
like that - we're talking about for our
audience consumer facing price of SSDs
and memory yeah and in the I guess the
way I look at it correct me if I'm wrong
but I guess my understanding is if the
memory makers are the NAND makers are
refactoring their facilities or their
process or whatever you know processes
then that's taking part of the assembly
off line yeah during that period so that
would presumably that would lower your
supply for the period your refactoring
yeah well and that's just assuming that
they don't add factory space and I think
in a lot of cases they did but the catch
is that in the early days their yields
were just not as good right as they were
and so you had this combination of more
advanced inexpensive technology lower
initial yields and the density was not
was sort of not as much of an advantage
as you would hope at 32 layer because
you know remember I said they went from
a really small plane
sell to a bigger cell but step on top of
each other so yeah then that effect was
in essence we reduced the amount of NAND
in the marketplace but everyone agreed
that 64 layer NAND was definitely a win
over any planner NAND and so at that
point once everyone once all of the the
four vendors or manufacturers are on 3d
NAND and they've got their yields we're
gonna see supply go back up to normal
and I think what we will probably see
his prices going down and you know
you're probably maybe a little bit
better tuned into this than I am but I
think that's what we've seen in the last
couple months yeah SSDs and the very
least have not gone up in the way that
memory has yeah like DRAM and it's
definitely it's stagnated I think cuz
when we were putting together sales
guides for end of year last year mm-hmm
memory was never on so I mean it was on
sale like twice yeah and the sale was
ten dollars yeah but SSDs they weren't
on sale there they're typically always
at the same price as they were the year
before so it didn't go up yeah but it
didn't really come down I think it might
be taking a slight dip down now finally
which I guess it sounds like you're
saying part of that as the industry
coming to consensus on 64 layer yeah
that's right and in you know they'll be
moving tune in 96 layer in the future
right and then there are other options
to give you better density so you can do
three bits per cell right which is
actually kind of crazy when you look at
the mechanics of how it work and it
makes your write endurance worse but you
know there's definitely a lot of
applications where that's that's really
a fine trade-off to make so as with TLC
versus vena and I guess if we're talking
because TLC MLC LLC those are all planar
well so that just refers to how many
bits are cell-cell and so the you know
the right way to think about it and this
is a little bit of a simplification is
in the SLC case all you kind of want to
know is is it on or is it off whereas
we're checking of a voltage state for
the
or something right exactly it's kind of
is it a one or is it a zero higher low
whereas with MLC it's more like well
okay now you've got four states you need
right back so is it you know low middle
low middle high or really high right and
then you can imagine with TLC now you've
got eight states and it's even more
complicated and so you know the real you
know NAND is a little bit more
complicated than dear iam from buying
perspective because it's you know
there's density there's price there's
performance but then you have the
endurance and so all of these techniques
to cram more bits in a cell make the
write endurance worse and smaller cells
make the write endurance work right so
you know part of what happened is with
the you know vini and or or whatever you
want to call it three dean and as
everyone said well now we've got these
bigger cells let's go take that
endurance that we got and use it to go
to TLC right okay and you know for again
for some people that's exactly the right
choice but you know some folks will
really want a lot of right endurance and
that may not be the best thing for sure
so then the SSD market in terms of
pricing and flash market sounds like it
should be recovering or stabilizing the
memory market does not seem like there's
an end in sight to the current price
trends you know I think we were talking
about this before how much memory did we
pay for our 16 gigabytes right kits in
our systems yeah you know I think I got
in it like a hundred maybe eighty
dollars something like that right those
are the good old days yeah and you know
I have a hard time seeing that happen
again for a while I you know ultimately
memory is a commodity and so it's all a
question of supply and demand and really
when you get down to it you know the
mobile phone market is growing yeah the
server market is definitely growing and
there are only three real suppliers
right exactly two depending on what kind
of memory
by I guess - were talking graphics
memory or something like that
great well you know I think they all do
graphics memory but I do
HBM - I guess yeah because you've got a
you have Samsung who does HP m2 on
bigger cards presently hynek's is more
or less capable of doing it at this
point
yep and I don't think microns got
anything right now yeah so micron had a
very interesting strategy and if you
remember the Xeon Phi it uses Hybrid
memory cube and so that was something
that micron put together and it is
proprietary and so it hasn't caught on
quite as much but it has some benefits
relative to HBM but just you know it
again did not really catch on super
widely although you know there's a lot
of super computers a lot of networking
and fpga is using it so it's just as you
know not going to make it integrate yeah
different market yeah and so I think
sooner or later micron will get around
to doing HBM it's just a question of
when frankly yeah well and then ddr4
prices - I mean as a desktop component
if you're building your own system right
it's kind of a low on the totem pole for
what the suppliers want to focus on
that's right margins gonna be better on
enterprise and server totally yeah and
you know there's a lot of cases where
and not just that but you know if you
think about someone the size of Apple or
Dell they obviously get way better
discounts and what new AG or we do right
at the end of the day so you know if you
if you happen to find a screaming deal
on memory you should let us know let
your friends know or maybe just hoard it
for yourself and then sell it to your
friends I don't know but you know I
think we'll see see SSDs coming down and
then you know there's also you have
Intel's obtained or you know 3d
crosspoint and you know in some ways
that's maybe one of the things I'm more
optimistic about I think you know they
still have some kinks to work out in it
the write endurance again seems to be an
issue there as a dram replacement but as
an SSD that stuff is screaming fast and
really amazing but I mean I just gotta
throw it out there that I am totally
looking forward to like a day when I can
get like enough a 3d crosspoint that you
know I can put the boot drive right in
3d crosspoint and you know like truly
instant on system and you know just to
hold everything in memory yeah that
would be pretty cool
yeah well Intel I guess they're pushing
for it they have their obtained dims
they want to do yeah that's that's what
I'm really that'll be really interesting
yeah so recapping yeah flash and SSD
market kind of stabilizing slightly
improved and then no end in sight for
ddr4 that's right yeah treat it like
cryptocurrency buy it and hoard it I
guess yeah end up with a thousand
percent gains next year but definitely
if you get a good deal on it buy it and
you know I mean I think it's always
interesting to look at new technologies
whether it's 3d crosspoint or someone
else's envy dims I mean I think one of
the things that we're starting to see is
a lot more innovation in memory just
because some of the other factors that
we use to get to performance or slowing
down a bit
so you know HBM 2 is a great example
yeah that makes sense yeah you know I
think for from a consumer standpoint you
hit the nail on the head
you know SSDs will probably come down in
price or you know maybe even if they
don't come down in price will at least
get better density so you know maybe
what's one terabyte today will be 2
terabytes or or whatnot but you know
just remember that did that you know
DRAM is actually expensive yeah very and
we'll talk about that more in the future
as well but if you want more David
Cantor's content check the link in the
description below or real-world tax calm
and thank you for joining me again
yeahbsolutely we'll see you all next
