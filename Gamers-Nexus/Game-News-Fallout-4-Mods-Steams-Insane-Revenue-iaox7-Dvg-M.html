net and this is your weekly game news
recap a new fallout 4 mod adds seasons
to the wastelands bringing a change of
pace to the desolate terrain by adding
desolate winter and Tesla it's sprained
hey there's always so much that Ahmad
can do the new mod makes for bright
sprains filled with green scenery gray
winters rot with steep snow banks and
somber falls with changing leaves and
fiercely bright summer's accompanying
those in its current state the mod does
not dynamically update the season based
on in-game clock so players have to
install the mod season which they most
want and leave it until that's manually
updated by the player the Mater hopes to
implement dynamic season changes in the
future and that's not available right
now but as a reminder fallout 4 doesn't
yet have an official toolkit so all of
this is being done with limited
resources overwrites ini files and some
carryover Elder Scrolls tools and that
limits the level of dynamic interaction
that mods can have at this time
Activision's call of duty franchise has
remained a front-runner for the games
industry for years and it's sequels
regularly top retail charts black ops 3
has just been named as the best-selling
physical retail game 4 2015 in a new
study released by the NPD group and the
analysis doesn't include digital sales
which basically eliminates pc from the
list but it still provides a look at
popularity of games sold predominantly
to console or casual players on that
list is call of duty black ops 3 in
first place with 250 million copies sold
followed by madden nfl 16 and fallout 4
then battlefront and fourth place grand
theft auto 5 took fifth place for
physical retail sales for 2015 in a
shrinking market for physical box goods
and considering that almost no PC
players buy stuff in store these days
that's a small cross section of the
industry luckily we've got some steam
stats for you to that look at the
Digital side of things a new report by
medium.com uses steam spy statistics to
dig up valves unruhe
old success in its winter sales the
report looks at sales volume for games
during winter sales and ultimately
concludes that valves volume has
increased by staggering fifty percent
over the summer sale according to steam
spy it looks like 46 million games were
sold just during the winter sale alone
including three hundred ten thousand
copies of fallout 4 grossing 14 million
in revenue and 339 thousand copies of
GTA 5 grossing 11 million in revenue the
winter sale as medium calculates should
have netted about 270 million in gross
revenue for the digital games publisher
and that's just from the winter sales
alone not counting other sources of
income an order the top sellers are
counter strike global offensive
unchallenged in first place with 575,000
sales though the game only quote unquote
made 4 million in revenue rocket League
is next with four hundred seven thousand
sales at five million in gross revenue
GTA 5 with three hundred thirty-nine
thousand quite a lot for a game that is
considerably older than some of these
other titles though global Offensive is
certainly no newcomer fallout 4 had
three hundred ten thousand sales though
the highest revenue out of all of them
and the indie title undertale was
following these much larger titles with
312,000 sales grossing 2.2 million in
revenue for the small developer
definitely a massive feat for undertale
the games industry quite obviously has
gotten crazy big ESPN the largest sports
broadcasting network in the u.s. anyway
has historically had conflicting
opinions about the world of eSports
we've heard broadcasters say they'd
sooner quit then commentate dota players
for instance and that's just won't of
the future of gaming but they've also
looked into the option of supporting
eSports in a new announcement ESPN it
looks like it's finally catching on to
gaming as a professional competitive
sport and as such the network will begin
covering eSports in the immediate future
ESPN launched a new hub to eSports where
the network promises to cover gaming
events and has already made moves to
employ known eSports reporters
interestingly activism CEO Bobby Kotick
is potentially one of the most hated men
in the games industry promise to turn
MLG which Activision just acquired for
46 million dollars into a quote ESPN of
eSports so and it's hopes to do so
Activision Blizzard on-boarded Steve
bornstein former ESPN CEO to head up
Activision to eSports network now
there's an actual eSports ESPN these
days so I'm not sure how Co takes plans
will change to accommodate that but it
will be an interesting battle for
relevance between the two as ESPN has
pulled on slasher a pretty well-known
gamespot commentator of older days and
former on gamers sports editor before he
was sacked following a reddit scandal
ESPN also hired a zoo booze Darren
quillin ski another qualified eSports
reporter and that's ramping up the world
of eSports pretty heavily in the
immediate future at least through 2016
the last bit of weekly news wraps with
Intel's Extreme Masters challenge or I
am and the next polish IEM event will
feature Intel Extreme Masters expo which
is a woman's csgo league and aims to
post 30,000 in prizes for counter strike
global offensive the event will be
hosted March 4th to 6th this year the
same time as IEM proper for lack of a
better differentiator and the 30,000
prizes that makes this one of the
largest women's eSports events to date
and should showcase some intense FPS
matchups definitely worth a tune in
that's all for this week's gaming news
