first stop is Lian Li is a factory so
we're gonna have a factory tour which
will be really cool ease check back for
that and also talking about some of
their new products this is the 11 air
you haven't seen it since CES actually
but they're a couple of updates and it's
getting close to launch then there's
also the land cool one that we'll be
talking about and a new sort of small
accessory these streamers before that
this video is brought to you by the EVGA
X 299 dark motherboard the one that we
recently used to take a top 5 world
record for fire strike overclocking
results the EVGA x2 99 dark board is one
of the best we've used presently in this
current generation and it has a coupon
code of gamers nexus for a savings of
$75 off for us customers expires on May
31st you've been interested in the X 299
dark with its actual vrm heatsink and
actual vrm cooling capabilities that was
a good time to grab it use code gamers
next as that check out click the link in
the description below starting with the
O 11 err this is the one we were most
interested in at CES and this case is
actually designed in collaboration with
one mr. dare Bauer who is an overclocker
he should check out his channel on
youtube if you don't know it so the O 11
air is supposed to now with its more
finalized specs but it's come with two
options so me $150 model which will have
six fans and then a $130 model that'll
have three fans so it's still kind of
TBD on the release date officially
there'll be a pre-order period just like
the 11 dynamic we're hoping to review it
11th dynamic did pretty well for airflow
actually in cooling in general and then
the O 11 air is really what I've been
looking forward to so the O 11 air
changes primarily in the top being a
grill and the front being a grill
obviously pretty clear small differences
include the back so the back now versus
the 11 dynamic has two 80 millimeter fan
mounts in the back and I think that's
more or less the majority of the changes
on this case so if you're excited about
at CES you can look forward to it
probably let's just call it before
August sometime
most likely and then for other products
there's the land cool one which we
talked about at CES as well we'll put
some b-roll up on the screen of that one
land cool ones had the most changes
since CES it's more or less been refined
internally on top of the power supply
shroud there now removable or socketable
SSD covers and if you remove them you
can actually install 120 millimeter fans
on top of the power supply shroud and
that's sort of interesting because we've
done testing the past with PSU shrouds
they're big inhibitors to airflow on
GPUs however if you take something like
an H some 100 I and tape over the holes
in the PSU shroud it actually doesn't
improve cooling a whole lot for the GPS
so it depends a lot on the case so for
this one the Emily's got the fan mounts
on top of the power splash shroud and
that should have enough pressure to pull
at least some air in through the bottom
of the case so if the power supply isn't
taking up the entire bottom you'll get
some airflow through there and then from
the front of the case although it's
quite distant at that point but either
way it's gonna be better than nothing so
that's probably the most interesting
aspect of that case the front where it's
got kind of a hole down the middle of
the front panel that's I mean you saw
that at CES I don't know if I don't
think it's changed a whole lot in terms
of the width but airflow wise you should
be fine overall it's not like it's gonna
be the best on the charts if you're
looking at something like an RL or 6
that'll be far better than 90% of the
other cases on the market so we're gonna
look at that one not clear yet on the
fans back the land cool one
and that's all so sometime soon ish for
later this year and finally this is the
streamers so this is one that we can
have some audience participation on
we're gonna go ahead and show some
b-roll of this and what I want you to do
is at some point
leave a comment and say what your
interest is in a product like this if
you would buy it and then perhaps what
you might spend for it so it's basically
a 24-pin ATX extension sits between your
power supply 24 pin and the motherboard
and it's got basically a fiber optic
sort of light pipe on top which has I
think 12 LEDs in it and then just kind
of an interesting bit of information is
this plate up here it's just a plastic
plate on the top on the other side
there's an aluminum more or less heat
spreader it's dealing with maybe four or
five watts of heat so not a whole lot of
heat but LEDs generate something so that
sits just between your motherboard and
power supply gives you some more LED
options if you're interested in those
I'll leave a comment let me know what
you're interested it is and something
like this and what you might pay for it
so I think that covers the new
for copy text 1:18 we're gonna do a
factory tour as well make sure you
subscribe the catch of that and as
always check out our store at store like
