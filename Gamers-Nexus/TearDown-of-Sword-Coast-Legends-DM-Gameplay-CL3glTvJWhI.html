dotnet and today we're reviewing sword
coast legends sword coast legends which
I'm abbreviating to scl is a newly
released dnd see RPG that has entrenched
itself deeply within Wizards of the
coast territory all the way down to
adoption of the 5th edition core rule
set of Dungeons and Dragons the tabletop
game for those who haven't yet dug their
way out of insurmountable piles of 3.5
books like I haven't the rule set may be
unfamiliar but it's still D&amp;amp;D and the
game looks similar in some regard to
older ddc RPG titles like baldur's gate
but strays in a few critical ways that
will discuss in this video notably we're
still on the Sword Coast within
Forgotten Realms content of faeren and
forgotten realms is a fantasy universe
with an extensive population of real
world's books and authors probably the
most famous of whom is RA Salvatore II
for his drizz Deward in series and he
also has contributed to the video games
world so you may know him from there as
well there are iconic cities in the
Forgotten Realms universe like water
deep baldur's gate and neverwinter which
should probably be familiar to many of
you if your experience with RPGs and
then there are other known regions like
icewind dale which has had its own game
series and the spine of the world and
shadow of em and things like that scl
allows up to four players cooperatively
playing in a party with an optional
fifth player as the DM or dungeon master
who plays non competitively with the
players there are two primary modes of
play you're either playing a dungeon
crawl or a campaign mode the latter of
which would include the game's built-in
story and player made modules and
campaigns alongside developer made
modules all available for free through
downloads in the in-game menus there's a
DM tool kit that allows players to build
their own campaigns complete with
dialogue stories quests and mob
placement and we're focusing on that
today with the objective of tearing down
into the really detailed insides of the
DM toolkit I spend about eight hours
building my own DM style playthrough
with a
DM required for my group and my group of
players is from the tabletop games that
I've played in my 9 year history of 3.5
fourth edition and savage worlds of
tabletop RPGs so we've got quite a bit
of history and experience together and
that does mean we were able to have some
more fun with Sword Coast legends than
perhaps a random drop in and play group
a good D&amp;amp;D campaign requires unique
locations colorful NPC party members and
companions loot and story and we're
going to go through STL's ability to
enable the DM to add each of these items
to their custom campaign with in scl the
M mode allows players to create
locations within Ferrin and the
underdark each using a set of
prepackaged thumb attic tiles for the
maps generation and when I say tiles I
mean that it's similar to the tile sets
you can buy for miniature gaming but
basically you're not placing tiles tiles
is just a word that means a theme for
the dungeon or area for example bandit
caves or under dark so we can create
bandit caves cavernous under dark
passages cities for the dark dwarves or
the doer gar human cities and similar
environments upon creating a location
the game rolls the dice to randomly
generate rooms and passages within a DM
spec and the DMS specification is
limited to just two items size and
complexity ranging from small to large
and from simple to complex this approach
allows for rapid deployment of dungeons
and leaves some room for the DM to
manually position prefab objects which
can include custom text assignable
quests and discoverability basically if
a player searches will they find the
item or the items action text like if
you had an engraving on a statue you
might see the statue but you need to
succeed a search or spot equivalent
check which I believe might just be
called perception these days in order to
find it sadly the DM has no means to
manually carve dungeon pathing or rooms
out of solid bedrock so we're contained
within the con
vines of the games random number
generator as far as the map creation
goes maps can be managed to a very
limited extent by blocking off undesired
rooms with impossible to find secret
doors but that's about the extent of our
dungeon layout management so thankfully
through workarounds that we found if you
really don't like how a dungeon is
potentially sending players to the boss
room before they find the rest of the
dungeon then you can set the bathrooms
door to be a secret door set its search
DC to impossible and then just pretend
through narrative that they find a key
or some means to access that door later
and we'll talk about that in a moment
there is no way to place freeform
buildings in cities and no way to add or
remove dungeon rooms or pathways so you
are bound to your abilities to utilize
the prefab objects like vendor carts
statues chests tents and so forth to get
as far as as they'll allow you these can
get us pretty far in terms of amping up
a dungeons design but you're still
assuming that your player group actually
likes inspecting things reading flavor
text and stuff like that because prefab
objects are no replacement for actual
customization or design or City design
or things like that the restriction
feels survivable we can get by without
the ability to customize our dungeons
and cities but it demands more
pre-configured locations to adequately
sate DM creativity otherwise you're just
putting the DM in a box and really
strictly limiting creativity at present
only eight dungeons and eight open area
tile sets are available with several
dungeons feeling overly similar they're
more of the same just with a slightly
tuned lighting effect and maybe some
different moss versus dungeon tile
things like that I would be more
forgiving of the lack of location
customization where more locales
available but it just feels like
something we won't see until maybe DLC
at this point overlooking this
restriction we then turn to party
members the backbone of a good campaign
in my experience and tabletop and in
video games for the matter is a strong
cast
of NPCs who support the party sometimes
they're needed to level the difficulty
if you want to create a harder encounter
but still allow the player party to
defeat the encounter sometimes a good
for comic relief they're good for story
most of the time and that's critical to
any RPG where you are building some sort
of world for players to explore and this
is true of Neverwinter as well in scl
there's no DM mode option to add new
party members so you're stuck with the
same 5 NPCs from story mode all with
their progression saved from previous
games the best we can do is add a
friendly character who's controlled by
the DM so basically a DM PC has it is
called and that's certainly not ideal
the DM pc won't automatically spawn on
level loads so it won't follow the party
from zone to zone as they encounter
loading screens and the only way to get
it to spawn there is to pre place it as
the DM or place it live during play the
DMP see also won't automatically follow
the party unless it is DM controlled the
DM can possess the NPC which requires
some level of threat the DM currency for
placing objects and the MPC also won't
gain experience in levels it has limited
dialogue to whatever you set for it
through a cumbersome quest menu and it's
really ultimately an extra layer of work
for the DM to manage then it's worth
when adding a DM PC to the game because
you can't just add it to the players
party and allow them to control it which
would certainly be ideal this seems like
a tremendous oversight to me for a game
that offers custom modules and a
campaign mode but it feeds into our
forthcoming conclusion which is that
sword coast Legends is unnecessarily
obsessed with game balance this is best
represented by the restrictions placed
on party loot dm's can't create custom
items or plant specific items in chests
or as quest rewards all quest rewards
are restricted to quote random weapon
random armor and random trinket with an
immutable option to quote reward gold
you don't have an amount you can define
it's just reward gold and then the game
will sort out what it thinks
a balanced amount of gold's reward
chaste Alou is random and without
control and further there is a
restriction placed on how many chests
are allowed within a level that's pretty
annoying at times and this severely
challenges creative minds who want to
figure out means of narrative and
conveyance through traditional pathways
like items whether their weapons armor
or just books and things of that nature
that you might find and this challenge
makes for difficulty with what would
otherwise require interesting and fun
items to progress story the best
solution my group of friends found was a
lot of shoehorned narration by the DM
and that's fine it's certainly something
we're used to but at that point you
really might as well just play the
tabletop game or play with a tabletop
simulator like roll20 or something like
that assuming you are an actual DM or
tabletop RPG player and not just coming
for the PC aspect of Sword Coast Legends
Sword Coast Legends is so grossly
concerned with keeping the party
balanced that it hamstrings itself
significantly it removes its own ability
to offer a design tool kit for online
DMS want to really bring their gaming to
the next level when it comes to a PC RPG
by creating a fun interesting and
challenging experience for their friends
the game has to appeal to an online
audience and that online audience may
want random drop in and play of course
so that's a big consideration for the
developers make and that's where the
obsession with balance comes in
unfortunately it does limit the game's
actual potential to be something truly
great and unique and it's just generally
good practice to sacrifice some control
as a developer in exchange for more fun
as a player anyway and that's definitely
something that reigns true here where
we're not in a player versus player
environment so there's really not as
much of a demand for game balance even
if someone wanted to challenge me on all
this is if one of the developers came to
me and said you know I disagree that
we're being too limiting here we are
being limiting for these reasons and
these reasons make sense even in that
instance non-mechanical restrictions are
equally heavy for instance we can't just
add on click speech to idle
city-dwellers to provide some background
and flavor on the setting you have to go
through a series of somewhat difficult
to navigate menus with a lot of clicks
in between to create quests and NPCs and
things of that nature that are not just
the normal probable monsters which you
can set to neutral and ideally would be
able to allow them to talk to the
players have clicked on for example if I
wanted the town's folk to talk about the
big bad evil guy when clicked on to
build some suspense before the adventure
for instance the only way to really do
that well is through a sort of haphazard
work around that I discovered you create
a custom quest you name the quest
dialogue or something like that assign
it no rewards and then assign that quest
to all relevant NBC's and then type
their text this has the contingency that
the PCs have the quote unquote accept
the quest which you can certainly tell
them to do and it's very cumbersome it
immediately flags all npcs with quest
icons just for basic dialogue which you
don't want because you don't want to
sidetrack the player characters into
thinking that every one of these npcs is
critical to talk to they're not it just
adds flavor and background and to
further limit this sort of cumbersome
option the dialog has a restricted
length and it's actually pretty
restrictive so that's another creative
cage for the DM you can't have multiple
pages of dialogue it's just whatever
fits in that premade box that's what you
can type and if you want more you have
to either create more quests and get
creative with a lengthy series of quest
updates and progression for really doing
nothing or you have to create multiple
MVC's to talk through the same thing
action text can be assigned to objects
though so that's some help I often opted
for the talking statues trope rather
than navigating through menus and
workarounds just to get an NPC talking
triggers would have been a phenomenal
addition to the SEL editor there's a
period about 14 years ago where I avidly
built complex RPG maps in of all things
a gem
to which is an RTS but I had a powerful
map editor and it had triggers it was
possible to build these RPGs and aoe2
because of the trigger cause and effect
editors and I was tremendously
disappointed to see that scl doesn't
afford dm's the option to add triggered
events as a proper rpg-like effect
instantiated dialogue or threshold
triggers for too easy examples here's an
easy and stereotypical example that I
could create an AoE 2's editor or
several other editors in about five
minutes our heroes step into an empty
foreboding room filled with nothing but
prefab spiderwebs and eggs the door
closes behind them once past the
threshold trigger and to ensure no
players locked out we could say that the
lock is open a bowl with a lockpick
action and a 30-second timer begins once
that threshold is stepped into and the
door is closed so in this order our
players enter the room they step onto a
red square which is only read to the DM
as a threshold but not to the players
it's invisible that threshold has tied
to an effect called 30-second timer will
say 30 seconds starts counting down
during this time players can interact
with interim objects foreshadowing text
and if they figure out what's going to
happen they'll ready themselves
appropriately making for some fun
strategy for the game the timer then
expires and an encounter spawns you can
guess what that is probably spiders on
the parameter of the room in order to do
this in the current system and it is
possible you'd have to manually place
the enemies in game that's fine it's
doable I guess but it's clunky and won't
have quite the same impact as just
spawning all of these monsters at a set
time at the same instant so if you
manually spawn them you're clicking and
placing them around the room it can take
several seconds to a minute to really
properly configure the encounter and
that removes a lot of the impact and the
surprise factor this also means that a
DM is now required to play the encounter
properly so that further mitigates the
game's viability as a single player or
unguided co-op adventure platformer this
is a big deal it's very important and
cannot be understated
triggers would allow the game to persist
without a DM and still have complex and
counters so that I could go in as a DM
create an adventure for myself and a
friend and then we can travel through it
without Adams direct guidance in order
to cause these events this is a totally
non sequitur throwin but I was sort of
reminded by it by the locking door
aspect i talked about it'd be fantastic
to have keys in SEL there's no way to
plant keys right now and there's no way
to associate an object with something
like a door or a chest which is really a
weird absence for an RPG so if you
wanted to plant say forget the keys you
want to plant a book that we can just
pretend through narrative has a spell in
it that opens a door so you can't tie
that book to the door you can't plant a
key because they don't exist and tie
that to the door to open it it's got to
be done by just setting the door to
locked with an impossible DC or die
check and then as a DM you you sort of
fudge numbers until the players do
whatever you want them to do and then
open the door there's also an issue with
challenge rating which as I understand
it has been largely done away with in
more recent D&amp;amp;D editions admittedly I
have not played fifth edition so you
know but still that's fine for tabletop
but it's difficult to gauge encounter
difficulty without manually testing
every encounter when playing in scl in a
self-created module that probably should
be done anyway if you really want it to
be a good encountered but being that
testing all encounters is effectively
required for a good build it makes sense
to at least give dm's access to a drop
in play test button imagine if you will
a giant play button in the top right
corner of this interface then I can
click it as a DM and it just drops me
wherever I have a player object
indicator its bonds me there player
spawn and I can test to me it make more
sense to have this droppable player
character object and hit play to begin
testing at the location dropped then to
play through the module in its entirety
every time you want to test one
encounter you can save throughout the
the progression to be fair test
developers but that is another
cumbersome interface problem of which
we've already mentioned several this is
a serious oversight that places dm's in
a hard position of do I spend hours play
testing every encounter or do I cut
corners in which case I might have to
adjust encounter difficulty on the fly
that is one thing done very well within
Sword Coast Legends though on the fly
diem tools though still lacking are
powerful enough to fudge die rolls and
ease up or strength and encounters we
can place objects and monsters on the
fly or remove them if it's too hard we
can increase or decrease their health
depending upon difficulty and challenge
and we've even got the ability to plant
last-minute vendors neutral parties with
quests assigned like collection and kill
and defeat the boss quests and
friendlies who will temporarily aid in
fights the toolkit also makes a
provision of some high quality prefab
objects replacement and levels like
statues and furniture and relevant
duraguard city ruins things like that
each with assignable action text and
discoverability to reward players for
search checks creatures and encounters
are limited to just two creature types /
dungeon for example demon cultists and
under dark dwellers but the wide range
of interesting enemy types and high
quality models within those two creature
types / dungeon is generally an ample
allowance you've got enough to work with
to make for a fun set of mobs our means
to differentiate and amp up encounters
is augmented by a monster creator tool
for handcrafted mob generation so if you
wanted to take a floating flaming
skeleton and apply it to your only
humans set of enemies you could do that
through the monster creator you know
sign custom abilities change the
attributes do a level offset all that
stuff to make it more interesting in
terms of the variety of enemies my group
also liked that DMS can ask players to
use an rng or random number generator to
roll dice in the chat window so you can
roll d6 d8 t20 things like that though
it is a bit limited right now and it's
limited in some weird ways the logic
isn't present to add relevant modifiers
rolls so if you wanted to do a knowledge
check and I can't remember if knowledge
checks or wisdom or intelligence I've
taught my head to work with me here but
if you want to do a knowledge check and
say add a wisdom modifier let's say I
have a 14 wisdom so I get a plus 2 on
that roll right now that has to be sort
of ham-fisted or you do it manually
basically so if I roll I type / rel1 d20
and then I tell the DM okay got 14 but I
have plus 2 wisdom so it's really a 16 I
have to do that manually or the DM has
to make up numbers as they go which is
certainly ok but not ideal ideally with
some level of logic in the system you'd
be able to type / roll 1d 20 plus 2 or
even better / roll 1d 20 plus Wiz or
some identifiers that fetches your
wisdom modifier and applies it to your
d20 roll something like that look at the
end of the day there's an endless amount
of stuff you could ask for in any game
especially a game that has not only a
player option but a DM or creation
option I can sit here and write a huge
list of things and there's a very good
chance that ninety percent of it was
already discussed in design meetings by
developers some of it may have even been
in the pipes and was removed but there's
a reason these things don't make it in
its normally in the industry described
as either time or money or both and
that's normal in the world of game
development some of these decisions
though were actively made to ensure
balance and accommodation of pick up and
play parties which kills the DM toolkits
potential and is really not the way that
SEL is best utilized in my opinion
without custom party members without
triggers without more fine-tuned bat
management or at least more tilesets
relax with a glorified dungeon crawler
using the dnd rule set with an optional
add of someone else to drop in more
monsters as challenge dictates which is
really not as fun as it could be that's
ultimately what the tool kit comes down
to trying to build challenging and
counters for your playgroup but it for
go is the very important aspect of
trying to build interesting and story
driven encounters you can add text but
it's limited you can add quests but you
can't add normal dialogue for just
clicking on a random neutral party in
the dungeon it's a good way to have fun
mechanically through the DM toolkit but
mechanical found only gets you so far
before you burn out and that puts scl
more in the category of a Diablo style
dungeon crawler which it's not trying to
be I mean it is in some ways but it's
got so much more potential to be more
than that with a DM toolkit with the
story-driven narratives that it wants to
form and it's just lacking in important
aspects there has to be some way to make
new and interesting encounters and I
don't just mean combat I mean
encountering items and objects and
modules otherwise players grow
accustomed to the reality of the games
minimize toolset you pick it up you
realize I have seen everything there is
to see and you move on as a player and
that's sad to me because Sword Coast
legends has huge potential but now that
the game is released it's sort of a
matter of what's tapped into through DLC
and expansion packs and maybe patches if
they feel like it but the fact that
matters the frameworks out there and
it's done so who knows how many of these
things will be taken into consideration
going forward as it stands the game
feels like a thirty-dollar crawler
that's got maybe about 20 hours of
gameplay in it I do have fun when
playing with my old school dandy group
when we can't get together to play
tabletop but that fun is still going to
be limited I know that there's a shelf
life to my play time in the game before
I get bored of it that's true with any
game but it's especially true here where
I can sense it coming and that makes it
less fun so all I've really got to say
here is I'm disappointed in the DM oh I
wish it were expanded more plain as a
player as a player with a DM as a group
it's fun you'll get places but if you
don't have that already if you don't
have an established group of friends
this game is really going to be a
glorified dungeon crawler and if you do
have the group of friends just expect to
be frustrated by the DM toolkit expect
that you will be able to make it work
and have fun but it takes a lot of extra
effort time and you have to make
sacrifices and then compensate for those
sacrifices
by filling in your own narrative vocally
over whatever voice chat you're using so
