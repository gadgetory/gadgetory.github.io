it gives us some insights as to how the
Volta architecture could react to
different games and engines as opposed
to Pascal the point isn't to look at raw
performance in a hundred different
titles but to think about what the
performance teaches us for the future
potential gaming volte cards this will
look at Volta architecture obviously you
shouldn't be spending three thousand
dollars to use a scientific card on
gaming but that's what we're doing for
now and we'll add more tests in the next
few videos
our teardown it should already be online
but for now we're focusing on
overclocking and framerate and then
we'll move on to production power and
thermal videos before that this video is
brought to you by thermal Grizzly makers
of the conductor hot liquid metal that
we recently use to drop 20 degrees off
of our temperatures thermal Grizzly also
makes traditional thermal compounds we
use on top of the IHS like cryo not and
hydro not pastes learn more at the link
below
so this is it the card is in pieces we
are currently in the process of probing
all the different MOSFETs to figure
stuff out for build Zoid for his PCB
analysis and we're working on other
tests as well but for now we're looking
at frame rate now this card to catch
everyone up to speed you can find the
specs table in the article linked below
we can put it on the screen as well no
point in going through all that when you
just read it and it's a bit boosted
over-tighten XP in CUDA cores but
there's some deficit in the core clock
which tends to happen as you increase
core count the big thing here though
with Volta are with the Titan VIII
specifically is that it's not a gaming
card that means it's got a whole lot of
stuff on the GPU that will never make it
to gaming GPUs as they roll out one of
those examples would be tensor cores
those are utilized for deep learning
machine learning type of algorithms and
have no purpose in gaming so these are
features of a card which will be
functionally off when we're playing
games and that's part of the cost that
would be removed from future gaming
cards and it also means that you can put
other stuff there it means that you
could potentially reduce the physical
footprint of the GPU or that even the
HBM might change in the future to a
different memory type we don't know the
exact details of gaming voltage cards
but it gives this gives
a foundation from which we can build a
base understanding and start to look
into Nvidia's next big architecture so
let's start with overclocking notes we
have an OC stepping table that we can
put on the screen that shows the
complete stock card starting out
operating at a peak frequency of sixteen
eighty two megahertz and firestrike
extremes at looping stress tests with an
average of 1507 megahertz after thermal
limitations are applied simply increase
in the fan speed to 90 percent
immediately pushes us to 1605 megahertz
average with no other changes and we
next increase to the power target and
fan speed
dragging us up to sixteen seventy two
megahertz average from there we
incrementally stopped core offset
upwards eventually encountering
stability issues at around two hundred
twenty five megahertz with one reboot in
between due to driver crashes our final
core offset was two hundred megahertz
and the final HBM offset was also two
hundred megahertz we left the fan at
100% speeds and were still bound by
thermals sitting at around 81 to 84
degrees Celsius will be taking the more
in-depth thermal measurements including
vrm measurements in our next few content
pieces along with power consumption but
today we're looking at gaming alone this
card has a lot more room for
overclocking in it but we need to liquid
cool it we might do things like shunt
mods in the near future with some help
from Build Zoid to really see what we
can get out of the card right now it
looks like we're running into thermal
limitations first so to be very clear on
how Pascal and it seems Volta both work
the first thing we learned about Volta
is boost functions pretty much the same
way as on Pascal there may be new things
in there we don't know about yet but as
far as how it works with thermal and
power limitations what's happening is
once you exceed the magical 60 degrees
Celsius number you do start dropping
clocks of it now obviously you tend to
always operate above that number for the
most part without going liquid or crazy
on your fans beads so you're not really
thermal throttling and so to speak
you're just not clocking as high as the
thermal limitation would allow you to
once you get to 80 degrees Celsius it
really starts dropping clocks and 84 you
basically hit a wall so that looks about
the same on volt it might be a little
bit lower on the
be the Titan V that we have here and if
it is lower its 81 or 82 degrees instead
of 84 but we're basically up against the
limit so we'll try and do a hybrid mod
but subscribe so you can catch that when
it comes up if it does when you see if
we can actually adapt a cooler to it
without crushing that we're cracking the
HBM first because $3,000
so that'll come at the end of the
process but that looks like about where
we're limited is 200 megahertz core and
memory it's actually a very good
overclocker so far we haven't really had
problems with it other than running into
thermal and power limits to things that
we are capable of somewhat resolving if
not mostly resolving so that's something
we'll be looking at shortly there will
be no partner models of this particular
card but presumably Volta will come to
consumer and if it does we would hope to
see similar overclocking behavior as
we're seeing here but the clock behaves
basically the same as Pascal as far as
it pertains to the various boost
limitations and interactions with
thermal power and voltage restrictions
we have no voltage control right now to
speak of so short of doing shunt mods
that's about where we're stuck let's
look at some of the other benchmarks
there so we can start with time spying
synthetics the point of this is to
establish a baseline for how this
particular architecture behaves with
very repeatable reliable synthetic
benchmarks that have specific elements
in their benchmarks that we can pinpoint
and say the difference between these two
numbers is tessellation or is ray
tracing or stuff like that so we'll
start with time spy as always before the
test methodology and the platform we
used you can check the article linked in
the description below times pi gave us
more trouble than fire strike or any of
the games for that matter and refused to
launch the second graphics benchmark at
all without breeding memory back down to
a 150 megahertz offset from 200 and core
down to 175 everything else was fine at
200 for each times pi measured our
graphics core at twelve thousand three
hundred eight points for the stock Titan
V plays in at twenty two percent ahead
of the stock Titan XP tested again today
that one was at ten thousand ninety two
points overclocking the msi 1080 TI
gaming x got us the closest
viii at ten thousand seven hundred
ninety eight points and this marks the
stock Titan V as fourteen percent I had
a v10 a DTI gaming X overclocked card
comparing the frame rates from each of
the two graphics tests will help us
understand where Volta is doing better
Volta holds approximately a 23% lead in
graphics test one which week in the show
and about a twenty two twenty one
percent lead in graphics test two
graphics test two has about three times
as much tessellation as graphics test
one and relies more heavily on volume
ray casting which dynamically traces
raised through the volume for each pixel
graphics test two tends to be
significantly more memory sensitive and
will crash faster under borderline
stable vm clocks this gives us a
starting point for where Pascal and
Volta diverge particularly when knowing
the tessellation versus a ray casting
differences of the two benchmarks
well yeah fire strike let's start with
ultra and check the graphic scores for
baseline this one shows that less of a
lead than x pi which uses newer lower
level programming techniques than fire
strike with fire strike ultra we're
actually seeing our Titan XP overclocked
card outperform the Titan V by about
five point three percent overclocking
the Titan V of course gets it ahead of
the overclocked Titan XP leapfrogging it
by eight point three percent this isn't
all that impressive particularly
considering how much better it did in
times by relatively versus an
overclocked 1080i gaming X the
overclocked Titan VIII is about 16%
ahead again for the price difference not
that impressive to understand why this
behavior occurs we can look at graphics
1 and graphics 2 scores once again
graphics test 1 loads the GPU with
Polly's and heavy tessellation it does
not however apply much of a compute load
graphics test 2 increases compute
workloads and can stress the memory more
similar to times by graphics s2 but with
less tessellation focused that in times
by looking at the numbers we see
somewhat considerable gains in the Titan
v with graphics s1 ranking at 48 fps
average stock as opposed to the Titan XP
is 40 FPS average stock the Titan V
manages a significant 20% lead here but
also falls behind in graphics test 2 the
V is at 26 FPS versus
26 FPS from the stock Titan XP and
graphics s2 and overclocking each card
gets them both 229 FPS for graphics s2
despite a considerable 22% lead in GT 1
for the Titan VIII the 55 versus 45 FPS
numbers for example it is tied or
slightly behind in graphics test 2 in
the worst case scenarios and a quick
shout out to the crossfire Vega 64 is
there showing that times by fire strike
and 3d mark in general still care a lot
about multi-gpu even if a lot of the
games out there nest don't necessarily
show the same level of near doubling and
performance but looking at all this data
it appears that the Titan VIII has
stronger potential in tessellation and
geometry heavy scenes and even with a
great amount of geometric complexity and
it might also be somewhat memory bound
in gt2 but we're not 100% positive on
that right now the advantage in times by
suggest that there's improved
asynchronous compute performance with
the Titan VIII over the previous Pascal
cards and this is something that we can
look into pretty easily by using lower
level API games like doom Sniper Elite 4
and potentially ashes of the singularity
all of which use either DirectX 12 or
Vulcan and let's start that off with
doom with doom at 4k and with
asynchronous compute enabled the stock
Titan V places at 132 FPS average for
average frame rate alone we're about 41%
ahead of the Titan XP stock GPU
overclocking the Titan XP actually let's
give it some help and defer to the
overclocks hybrid XP gets it to 113 FPS
average this allows the Titan via stock
card to hold a 17 percent lead and we
did actually retest doom and saw pretty
much the same numbers as we've seen for
the last couple of rounds of tasks for
the Titan XP so no improvement there to
speak of over the last few months the
stock Titan XP is largely choking on its
cooling and for starters it's also
limited in power for a restricted
performance overall either way once we
account for a Titan V overclocked we're
at 157 FPS average versus 113 FPS
average or back to 8 39.5% lead for the
Titan XP scallion is pretty linear
between stock and overclocked tests
and the Titan V does lag behind in one
key area that's frame times we think
part of this has to do with drivers in
fact if you look at our older Titan XP
data from around May you'll notice that
it's low frame time performance was
actually a bit better as was also the
case for the older 1080i data looking at
modern data sets with the Titan V and
the Titan XP that were both tested again
today we see that they're closer in lows
than they are to their older test data
like the Titan XP from previously the
big takeaway here as indicated by times
by is that the volta card seems to have
improved performance specifically an
asynchronous compute titles at least
this one doom with Vulcan and we can dig
into that theory further with sniper and
then reinforce it with D 3 D 11 titles
as for the frame time differences that
looks like it's more of a driver thing
overall or potentially a change in the
dooms offer between the original tests
and the more recent ones Sniper Elite 4
is our next title run at 4k with high
settings DirectX 12 and asynchronous
compute enabled stock the Titan VIII
operates at 115 FPS average with lows at
97 and 91 for 1% and 0.1% lowers
respectively
this place is at about 27% I had an
average FPS of the Titan XP stock GPU
posting massive leads over the
predecessor this is after retesting the
Titan XP with the latest drivers as well
so what we're seeing is a legitimate
performance uplift in the Titan v
despite its clock deficit before digging
into the rest of that chart some more
let's analyze some of the data we have
now what we've learned in the past was
Sniper Elite is that it's particularly
shader intensive on both Andy and NVIDIA
Sniper Elite is one of the few titles
where when overclocked equally the vega
56 and vega 64 cards show a bit more of
a difference than we see elsewhere it's
also one of the few titles where when
you clock them similarly ignoring the
memory differences in latency the GTX
1080 and 1070 Ti achieved pretty similar
performance in basically every title
except for sniper and doom it to some
extent because of that difference in
shader reliance so sniper actually likes
those extra shaders from the 1080 over
the 1070 ti ignore
the memory latency aspect of that
conversation and it also likes the extra
shaders from the Vegas 64 over the Vega
56 now this would then follow to the
Titan V which we're seeing significant
uplift on today and that seems to be a
shader difference potentially there's a
whole lot of other differences there we
can't account for all of them yet it's
too early but that gives us a baseline
so it makes sense the game is built to
asynchronously cue render jobs into
different shaders so having more shaders
means that you can have more
simultaneous render jobs in flight
actively so that would follow that more
shaders would help with your framerate
in this particular instance now sniper
is also pretty sensitive to clocks but
the difference between what it cares
more about is kind of nebulous it
depends on the architecture it depends
on if it's AMD or Nvidia there's a lot
of variables there but generally this
game unlike a lot of the others is
extremely sensitive to pretty much any
change in a GPU except perhaps gddr5
memory speeds back to the Sniper Elite 4
chart for a moment overclocking Titan v2
it's 200 megahertz offset gets us 41%
ahead of our overclocked Titan XP hybrid
card this is a tremendous gain and shows
that the card becomes more constrained
by its stock clocks in this particular
title and a takeaway is that the extra
shaders help but they need to be fed
with higher frequencies to really engage
Foley for reference we'll highlight a
1080 TI card they're not too far behind
all things considered and obviously make
far more sense as an affordable gaming
purchase that still permits max settings
ashes of the singularity is our final
non DirectX 11 title this one poets a
problem for us we didn't plan to ever
test cards of this caliber and so our
standard 4k test with high graphics
immediately demonstrated a CPU
bottleneck as you can see here all the
cards basically equalized around 97 to
99 FPS average so we cannot draw any
conclusions as we're now bumping against
external limits and the GPS aren't fully
engaged for this reason we reran a few
tests with 4k crazy settings and applied
an 8x MSAA option to force load on the
GPU so with 8 tab MSAA we get down to a
point where the numbers are now
comparable we don't have as many numbers
for this as it was
but you get the idea the Titan V
operates are at around 82 FPS average
when overclocked a lead of 9.5% over its
stock configuration against a Titan XP
the stock Titan V has a lead of about
10.2 percent
put a seventy four point eight five to
sixty seven point nine FPS average the
low one percent and 0.1% low values
represent frame time consistency and are
also close by this number sounds a lot
more down to earth than previously and
demonstrates the extent to which game
development impacts scoring of this
class of card we can extrapolate
wide-reaching results from the other
titles across all titles in gaming but
ashes is DirectX 12 and it does not
leverage the Titan V to the same extent
as one of the other DirectX 12 titles
Sniper Elite for either that or it
doesn't become choked on the Titan XP
pipeline enough to demonstrate those
Delta's moving on to another chart of
limited tests we have hell-blade which
is our Unreal Engine representative
hell-blade has our Titan via stock art
at 67 FPS average while our overclocked
variant operates at 74 FPS average for
an improvement of 10.5% over stock
versus the Titan XP we're at 49 FPS
average stock and 54 FPS overclocked
putting us at 37% improved when
comparing only the Titan V and a Titan
XP numbers our improvement is 37% stocks
of stock these gains are larger than
we'd anticipated considering that this
is a DirectX 11 title and several key
functions of the Titan VIII are
unutilized in games let's look at Ghost
Recon for another one at 4k and very
high settings the Titan vgpu operates at
62 FPS average with lows at 54 and 50
this is a stark difference from the last
few games the 1080i GPUs have no trouble
keeping up with the Titan B stock GPU at
all and the overclocks
1080 T is e2 somewhat proves that point
by achieving parity the $750 card shows
the importance of GPUs targeted purely
at gaming
particularly when matched against its
$3,000 scientific targeted counterpart
against the Titan XP we're still looking
at a difference of about 1 to 2 FPS
between the Titan v and XP so nothing
exciting there overclocking the Titan V
gets us a bit beyond the XP overclocked
about
6% ahead of the overclocked hybrid XP
performance and demonstrates what's
lacking Ghost Recon seems to want higher
clocks and the additional shaders just
aren't helping this is why it's
important to have a wide sweep of games
rather than just all games and then talk
about what drives those differences or
at least what we think drives those
differences there's a lot to know here
and we haven't figured it all out yet
Ghost Recon isn't more old-school in its
DirectX 11 implementation if for Honor's
shows us similar results we can start
building a case about certain DirectX 11
titles and Titan performance at least as
it pertains to Ubisoft 1440p and 1080p
results will be in the article below and
here's for honor also made by Ubisoft at
4k the stock Titan VIII has us at 83 FPS
average but with lows ranging somewhat
sporadically from 29 0.1% to 40 FPS 0.1%
the 1% lows range from 57 to 74 this
range is significantly wider than we see
on other cards and potentially indicates
driver level frame pacing issues with
the drivers the Titan VIII still manages
to chart top but it's only a couple FPS
ahead of overclocked 1080 TI cards
versus the stock Titan XP the Titan VIII
is about 14% ahead so it's a lot closer
than in some of the other titles though
the lows are somewhat difficult to
compare given their seeming randomness
moving on to destiny - for another
DirectX 11 title and starting with 4k
high settings we get another scenario
where the Titan V stock GPU only
marginally outpaces the Titan XP GPU the
difference is about 4.1 percent with the
XP showing significantly stronger frames
on consistency than the Titan V we're
not presently sure if this is a driver
optimization layer problem or a
fundamental behavior when deploying a
scientific card in a gaming scenario
here's a look at a frame time plot
between the Titan XP and a Titan V just
to give an idea of what those frame
times look like when realized over time
as they should be the lower numbers here
are better but you also want more
consistency so it's not just strictly
lower is better it's more consistent and
lower is better moving on we look at the
overclocking version of the Titan V
which got an FPS of 125 average in the
same tests provided a substantial 21%
lead over
stocke excitin b-but the card still
struggles with frame time consistency
performance is comparable to the Titan
XP and 1080 Iowan stock minimally and
illustrates there are low-level API
gains that stop with a title like
destiny - at 4k and highest settings we
only have a few cards present as the new
destiny - Nvidia drivers wiped out our
charts because we needed to retest
everything the Titan be tested at 88 FPS
average with the overclocked granting an
18% uplift still significant it would
appear that destiny cares at least a
little bit about clocks whereas some of
the other titles we looked at don't
necessarily care as much and might like
shaders more the Titan VIII also carries
a 13.6% lead over the Titan XP stock GPU
went under the highest settings and what
this illustrates for us is that as we
move towards certain types of titles
like Ghost Recon and for honor we start
seeing performance that's a lot closer
the bigger gaps for the Titan V and the
Titan XP at this point were around 14 15
percent somewhere in that range so being
that that's the widest we see obviously
that's not extremely exciting for $3,000
card to be fair it's not really meant
for that type of task but the idea is
less of what it's meant for and more of
what we're seeing in the other games
which is things that have a sink compute
things that use lower level api's and
some of that could be just coincidence
that the game developers focus more on
optimization in general we know for
example that in software put a
tremendous amount of effort into
building Doom to work extremely well
with just about everything so the fact
that we're seeing big performance gains
there it's kind of hard to pull from
that just how much does that apply to
other Vulcan titles and there aren't a
lot of Vulcan titles really test there's
Talos but no one plays that and it's
pretty old at this point anyway so we're
left wondering at that point Sniper
Elite 4 shows an asynchronous compute
direct x12 implementation that benefits
the Titan VIII pretty heavily but then
again we look at the Ubisoft titles and
you encounter questions of but how does
it look with DirectX 11 ashes of the
singularity which is a long-standing
DirectX 12 benchmark that's had plenty
of time to be optimized on all drivers
at this point so is pretty close
performance
sometimes 10 to 13 percent between the V
and the XP which again brings us back
down to earth of these aren't so
exciting gains but then again you look
at the gains that are huge and they are
kind of exciting at least from a numeric
value different standpoint so that's
what we have for the Titan V so far
basically if we're to try and learn from
this data given that it's not something
probably any of you or if any then not
many of you will buy a given that
parameter the takeaway really is just
that it looks like it's worth keeping in
the ion Volta specifically as it
pertains to things like async compute
implementations and low-level API
performance this is a key area where
NVIDIA has not increased its gains as
significantly as it's been able to with
DirectX 11 optimizations driver releases
and a long-standing code base of DirectX
11 support so given that Titan V so far
is looking pretty good in those
low-level API element ations
with the V which is admittedly a brute
force solution there might be a change
there for volta versus Pascal and
Maxwell which although not necessarily
bad in those implementations were
certainly not that impressive as
compared to their relative DirectX 11
performance where NVIDIA has spent a lot
of time and money building their
codebase drivers and architecture to
work well so this might be a point where
Nvidia starts tipping the scales towards
the lower level api's if that's true and
we're not saying that necessarily as we
need to see gaming cards if that's true
it'll come down to developers of course
actually doing more with these low-level
API is but be careful how I've already
take that because it's basically
speculation based upon some testing of a
scientific class card that has an insane
amounts of cuda cores and is not built
for this particular task so we can only
take that so far but take it for what it
is it's an economic experiment basically
the high-end card you could gain with it
if you wanted to it's just not meant for
that so 1080 Ti is still the clear
winner if you're trying to pick it for a
high-end gaming device but we'll see
what both it does when it comes to
gaming so that's all for now check back
soon for
our production test which is more what
the cards meant for and we're going to
be doing a lot with power thermals
