EVGA booth now looking at a white
edition of the DG 77 the EVGA dg7 series
cases I think we first showed it at CES
then later at Computex this word is just
white before we get into that this
content is brought to you by the
thermaltake flow RGB closed-loop liquid
cooler which is a three hundred sixty
millimeter radiator plus three 120 fans
that are RGB illuminated if then we'll
take it ringing fans at that doesn't use
a 4.5 done a stack pump which is one of
the faster pumps you can learn more at
the link in the description below so two
changes here there are the full white
versions and then a white and black
two-tone we have some photos of it and
basically the the main thing here is
just price TBD but it's supposed to be a
mid tower probably targeted around where
the 400 C or the 400 crystal would be
more likely towards the 400 crystal in
terms of the competition the case itself
supports for total fence stock so it
comes with four you can run up to a 280
on the front maybe a 360 we're not sure
we're checking on that but definitely a
280 on the front I think it looks like
120 in the rear and then we've got
support for at least 120 s on the top
but overall the case the same tooling as
the DG 7 that we showed at CES an
economy Tech's some minor changes there
changes to the product but not the
tooling this right here will eventually
be an EVGA logo it's supposed to be I
think RGB LED lit they don't have it in
here for the show but that'll be there
for launch
and then there's one on the front that
will be RGB LED lit as well in terms of
the front
it's a tempered glass panel with a white
paint on the back to fit the rest of the
theme and then the LED is supposed to
kind of sit back there and show through
it like a diffused layer the airflow is
entirely from the right side of the
front panel with some less than one
millimeter intakes around the rest of
the glass but basically your intakes on
the front right side not sure how well
it'll cool but we'll find out in terms
of the rest of stuff there's cutout in
the power supply shroud for radiators
and I'm it's a large cutout you might be
able to put our hard drive in there as
well
looks like cutouts for the PCIe cable
past it in the front some ventilation
for the PSU and then the big thing here
the DG 77 models will allow vertical
orientation video cards so as you can
see here with the FT w3 it does come
with a PCIe riser card and that's only
on the 77 model then the other models
are the three five and six they skip
four and those will be cheaper they lose
the PCI your Iser card some of them are
available in different colors and others
you lose some of the fans you lose some
of the tempered glass things like that
but you drop the price so that's what
EVGA is going for with this one well
they don't want to point out I do like
the top how it's got the two-tone white
black where the inner grille is painted
black that looks kind of good actually I
haven't seen too much of that
ventilation looks okay on the top
ventilation looks fine on the back the
fronts a little weak but we'll find out
I'm if you throw a rat in there you'll
make up for it it's just yeah we'll see
we'll see how it goes but that's the
case I have no price right now launch
date is targeted in November for this
year and it'll be shipping in three five
six and seven models skipping four so as
always you can subscribe for more help

gamers nexus thank you for watching I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
