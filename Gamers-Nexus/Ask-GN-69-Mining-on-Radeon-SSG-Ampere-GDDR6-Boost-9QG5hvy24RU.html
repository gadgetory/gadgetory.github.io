Jian episode as always you can leave
your questions for next time in the
comment section below and we also are
doing a part two of this video so
there's a two-parter this week this is
the main one
we'll have sort of an after-hours or
extras ask GN segment that is going live
for patreon backers only and we'll be
publishing that on the patreon page so
keep an eye out for that one we're gonna
film it right after this before that
this video is brought to you by
Thermaltake and the view 71 enclosure
the view 71 is a full tower case that's
capable of fitting three video cards and
most configurations it's also one of the
better cooling cases in our recent case
testing bench lineup the view 71 has
hinged a tempered glass doors on either
side that make it easy to open and show
off and it comes with at least one rain
fan though you can get the RGB version
if you prefer learn more at the link in
the description below I wanted to start
this one off with just a quick news item
on GDD our six because it'll probably be
a day or two before we do our next news
video and this is kind of noteworthy so
before getting to questions g-d dr6 has
had some news lately
the newest bit of info is from SK Hynix
who are noting that their GDD are six
chips are available for purchase now
from the partners who buy them to make
stuff so they're selling the memory
modules at 10 12 and 14 gigabits per
second this is a bit slower than the
modules that Samsung has talked about
however Samsung's aren't available yet
and they were still pre-production when
they last spoke of them I think Samsung
was indicating maybe as high as 16 to 18
gigabits per second for its speeds
whereas hynek's is capping out at 14
here and other than that the speeds risk
or the bandwidth respectively would be
40 gigabytes 48 gigabytes and 56
gigabytes per second for the hynek's
modules at 10 12 and 14 gigabits per
second so that's kind of what we got for
now voltages are 1.25 or 1.35 depending
what it is and we'll talk about this
more in a news item sometime soon but I
want to put that out there because it's
kind of interesting news and it has
implications for the GPU market we
already know that new GPUs are coming
sometime this year so that sort of I
don't know we'll see if they actually
end up on the cards or if that's
next-generation but either way they will
be ready for purchase by manufacturers
so first question for this one was
pretty interesting this is from YouTube
commenter Ben Grogan who said open van
GPU heat sinks run their fin arrays
transverse on the card is there a reason
why this is the case beyond it longer
heat pipe runs would there be any
benefit to longitudinal fins which would
allow the case front fans to encourage
front to back airflow so as I understand
it the question is basically is
convenient questions basically why are
these fins running up down versus left
right and I talked to a few people about
this including VSG from thermal bench
and I think our answer is all pretty
much aligned which is it's the same idea
as for radiators for liquid cooling
where you're in this case you're trying
to expose as much of the primary heat
transfer heat dissipation element as
possible and in the case of an
air-cooled heat sink as opposed to
liquid really what's doing most of your
work is those heat pipes so these heat
pipes in this instance are all running
left to right and that layout allows the
heat pipes to be as long as they can be
going top to bottom looking me shorter
left to right if you did the horizontal
fin layout you wouldn't get as much
contact to the heat pipes and that's
kind of from what I understand a bit
less of a concern than just the heat
pipe run length in general and to catch
our one-up I'm sure most of you know
this at this point but heat pipes do a
phase change so that's why they're so
effective at cooling there's basically a
liquid in there we've talked about its
composition in the past and content
pieces there's a liquid in the heat pipe
when it gets over the GPU in this
instance heats up turns into a gas
that's a phase change goes to the other
end of the pipe cools down condenses
uses capillary action to come back down
the heat pipe as a liquid where it
repeats the process turns the gas again
and so in that phase change process
going from liquid to gas and back you're
losing a lot of your energy in the form
of heat and that's what really does the
cooling so to get the most benefit out
of that it's got to be a longer
pipe and running across the card this
way is obviously going to give you a
bigger heat pipe than up and down so if
you go across the card can't really have
horizontal fins as well it would expose
to the front case fans better but those
are doing such little work compared to
the fans on the card anyway perhaps with
a passive card maybe like a really low
end passive card with no heat pipes or
something maybe that makes sense I could
definitely see that making sense in a
small form-factor case or something
that's just getting really putting a lot
of requirements at that point getting
really niche but other than that
let's see bite any notes from VSG so VSG
told me for his own take on it
saying as he says it's the same as for
liquid radiators the heat pipe and
coolant tube has to be on the longer
side of things to allow for as big of a
delta temperature as possible so fins
are stacks perpendicular and sometimes
in columns and rows if there's room for
more than one set of heat pipe or
coolant tubes you want to give the best
option possible for the coolant medium
so that it will do more work in this
case it would be the phase changer in
the heat pipe if you have longer fins
that's also more solder points and
logistics of making more fins versus
more heat pipes also comes into play the
solder points are up on the weakest
point of transfer in an air cooler like
this it's typically 10 there are other
types of solder though and I haven't
really thought up without any
manufacturers on when they use 10 versus
something else so that's something we
dig into more people are interested but
yeah that's your weakest point of
contact and then I think everything else
that has pretty much been inside at this
point so that's most of it very good
question though I think we can count
that as answered for now but if anyone
has add-ons to that question let me know
or if you're just interested in air
cooling parts in general we also ask the
EVGA about the heat pipes and they had a
pretty good point here they noted that
for the heat sinks they want the
shortest distance for the hot air to be
exhausted so that's accounting for the
fans on the top making sure that when
they blow air down into the card it
needs to have a clear path to get out of
the card and having longitudinal fins
would stretch that out and make
take longer for the air to get out of
the way so I was a good point as well
next question is it's from ten teraflop
APU barrier
who said ask Tien sorry if this has been
asked before when benching the
performance of a baseline GPU boost 3.0
enabled card is it fair or should these
cards have their boost clocks locked to
the manufacturer specified boost maybe
I'm misunderstanding something but it
would seem that you could see
exaggerated performance gains as now a
stock card is effectively being thrown
against an overclocked one so to be fair
the stock card is also technically
overclocking / boost spec the boost
number that Nvidia gives in this
instance it because we're talking about
3.0 that's their thin the boost number
they give is not normally what you're
actually running at it tends to be
higher if there's thermal and power
Headroom I believe it'll be lower that's
the reason there's a base and a boost it
can be lower than boost under the bad
power or thermal conditions that may be
encountered on the card it should not
ever be lower than base that's the the
actual clock specification unless you
lower your power target but to answer
the question should you basically
normalize cards you can definitely lock
the clocks it's not very reliable it
tends to be a little bit it's unstable -
like with K boost or something so I
don't really like doing that but also
you have to realize that when you're
reviewing a card anyway the silicon
variance GP - GPU is the primary driver
and differences in how are they
overclocked it's good to have a strong
vrm it doesn't necessarily matter that
much because aside from a select few
cards like kingpin cards there's really
not a lot of bending that goes on and
binning is kind of a misnomer - because
even in that case what they're really
doing is just pre-selecting so they're
testing the chips they find the good
ones and they put it on whatever the
spec is for the card so for example I'm
just using EVGA here because I know what
they do if you have something like an
FTW three high-end card and then you
might have a lower end DT
card in the same cooler design and same
PCB what they do is they'll run the
cards all of them through testing when
it's on the PCB and pass or fail if it
passes it becomes maybe the high end up
tw3 if it fails it becomes the DT Series
with a lower specified boost clock so
the point of all that is to say that
silicon quality varies a lot more than
really anything else that the AIB
partner can do for you aside from the
cooler quality so when we're testing a
card what we're really testing in terms
of its clock performance is one what's
the quality of the silicon they used
which is not really part of the review
because that's basically random and it's
controlled by Nvidia more than the board
partners the next part is how good is
the cooling solution and that's what
really determines how the frequency will
fluctuate from boost parameters that
we're talking about here so to normalize
these at a fixed frequency or something
like that would really be taking away
the advantage of a better cooling
solution or power delivery or whatever
it may be that establishes the real
differences in the cards and ultimately
again silicon variants per Nvidia's
manufacturing run will vary more than
really anything else anyway but yeah
it's a good question from a pure if
you're trying to collect really pure
data it could be interesting but you'd
have to have a big sample size to have
any confidence in it and and ultimately
we are testing the entire package the
whole card so to do that properly does
require not really messing with those
things for a stock baseline test because
you are trying to see how much Headroom
does that cooler give you for its clocks
anyway but yeah that's I think that's
that's kind of most there's a lot more
to say on this when I've said it a lot
in the past too and GP reviews but boost
makes things difficult and silicon
quality tolerances make things difficult
so that's why when we're reviewing for
example a bunch of 1080i is a 10-7 tt is
after the first one or two all the FPS
testing stops because it's it's just
it's
to be the same it's gonna be the same
plus or minus silicon quality
differences if I line up 10 1070 T is
here asu's EVGA gigabyte everybody the
difference is between them in terms of
gaming performance unless one has a
really bad cooler those differences will
amount to silicon quality if you put an
air cooler like some Aero card on there
that would be worth testing because then
your cooling performance is gonna be so
bad that you could actually have a clock
deficit so that's kind of my parameters
for testing for reviews we mostly focus
on you know thermals and things like
that anyway next question is from David
Watson who said I think it's from
YouTube Steve this has been driving me
insane why the hell are manufacturers
still using toothpaste compound for
their CPUs when we all know that by
using liquid metal you are dropping the
temperatures from anywhere between 8 and
20 degrees why haven't they cottoned up
why I think that's supposed to hey why
haven't they caught on to this obvious
and glaring fact by now surely they
realize the temperature drop only
significantly enhance the lifespan of
CPUs and make it superior product it's
insanity I've talked about this in the
past too I think it was with maybe the
79 AD XE review or one of those but
first of all liquid metal is not really
a great compound to use what you would
use instead is solder that's what I am
to use is on the rise in CPUs and intel
has used it in the past on some of their
high-end desktop even before that I want
to say Sandy Bridge I'll top my head I
think some Sandy Bridge CPUs used to
solder as well that would be your
alternative to liquid metal it'll be a
bit better it's better logistically
because you don't have to worry about
like cracking or we're just kind of
moving around and things like that
aging solder is gonna be a better
solution now why don't they do it well
liquid metal is too expensive and it's
impractical solder I don't have a great
answer for you I've tried to get one for
years and it's come down to a few things
I have a few theories on this now so for
the reason why doesn't Intel use solder
on their CPUs you could say cost cost a
bit more than doing their own paste you
could say there
intel has argued that the smaller dyes
have potential problems with solder
where they could crack over time or
develop micro fractures there's not a
great way to validate that however you
could point to any number of millions of
Sandy Bridge CPUs and other CPUs that
did use solder and were small dyes and
did not have micro fractures the larger
dies there's no that argument does not
apply so the high core count CPU is
there's no real argument there and
potentially you could start arguing
things like well maybe there's a
conflict-free side of things and tell
does that conflict free marketing I
don't know if there are any government
grants or anything like that but using
thrown paste from a conflict-free
factory or whatever it may be or source
or supplier I don't know if that gives
them any kind of incentive in terms of
money to do that whereas sourcing solder
without being hyper expensive may
interfere with that I don't know if
going like the going green side of
things is part of it as well I've heard
that kind of rumor does also with this
so I don't have a good answer
why Intel doesn't use solder I have
asked to them I have asked every PR rep
that's worked there in the last several
years I've spoken with it with about it
with their Bower a lot and we've kind of
hypothesized things on this channel
actually about why that may be the case
but anyway so liquid metals not a great
solution solder would be good there are
ups and downs I would like to point out
here that despite some of the rhetoric
Intel CPUs lately have actually improved
the high core count their own taste is
different than what the 7700 K used as
far as I'm aware and its thermal
performance is better and also at that
same base as used on the 8700 K and
overclocking them within reason is
really not that bad now if you want
maximum overclocked performance you do
have to basically delete it because it's
just you're going to run out of thermal
Headroom but they do operate pretty
reasonably with the stock compounds the
biggest problem with these high core
count compound CP
is not the thermal paste it's the
motherboard vendors blasting really high
Auto voltages to them to the point where
as we've reported in the past you get
seventy seven hundred KS operating
basically stock at ninety degrees
Celsius then you go in and manually drop
the voltage to something that's
perfectly stable and much lower and you
could be at sixty seventy degrees
Celsius with a two hundred eighty
millimeter cooler and max fan speeds so
a lot of its the voltages I will
certainly not argue that that solder
would be better but at the same time
liquid metal is not the ideal solution I
think that addresses pretty much
everything I know about the issue from
what intel's told me or not told me and
what i've spoken with other people about
but next question is from salad who said
in your recent d lidding and liquid
metal video your recommendation for
preventing liquid metal overflow or
spillage from getting on the cpu
contacts was DS nail polish an optimum
techs recent deleting liquid metal video
he recommends using silicon sealant the
same that you use on the IHS in this
video so any reason why you would not
recommend simply using the silicone
sealant to protect the contacts why
didn't you just use your silicone
sealant that you had on hand instead of
nail polish a couple reasons for that
one so the main one here is removability
so what kind of sealant you can you have
to basically pick it off to get rid of
it and there's a really good chance that
you're gonna rip off a surface mount
device when you do that those capacitors
are exceedingly fragile and you get away
with ripping one of them huff but no I'm
doing much more than that the resistors
and other things on there it's not worth
it
because if it's ever coming apart again
you should just use nail polish because
you can remove it with acetone if you
need to it's it's got a low profile it
lays perfectly around the surface of the
device you can still see the device it
doesn't create any kind of Z height
between the PCB and the IHS and again
it's easy to remove
whereas silicone adhesive if you have to
remove it because maybe your liquid
metal application has aged or you didn't
apply it very well the first time which
happens you have to remove it there's
more risk and damaging the parts if for
some
only goes wrong so that's that's my
primary reason and also it's again it's
just super easy to remove nail polish
and it does basically the same thing so
that's really all there is to that
also I hate where you can with silicone
adhesive it kind of sucks to work with
but next next question is from I don't
write down who asked this one it was in
the SDN questions challenge discord for
patreon members GM staff and Vidya
ampere and have your computing
unfortunate naming coincidence I think
that the name that people think the next
generation architecture is going to be
called might be incorrect but I'll leave
that there it might be a code name or
something we'll see if it actually ends
up being that the public name but I
that's I don't think it will be next
question is from webhead sm webhead sweb
head thank you for the difficult name a
stupid question I finally received it
new 1080 FTW if installed in the top 16
PCIe slot is a bit close to the CPU
cooler I watched the video that you did
regarding performance and 16 versus 8
lanes would it be stupid to use the
eight lanes to gain distance from the
GPU and the air cooler this would be on
my old and moldy but still rock-solid
gigabyte z77 motherboard appreciate the
input I think it's fine it's pretty
pretty straightforward PCIe gen3 I think
that might be done I don't know I think
that's still gen 3 right
it was either way it doesn't really
matter Gen 2 or gen 3 16 verses 8 if
there's difference it's gonna be like 1%
so yeah if that's what you have to do to
make sure it's got some distance and the
CPU cooler is not going to short the
card then just go with that I didn't
look up your motherboard some boards do
have by 16 slots lower down on the board
like a lot of the time you'll have you
know by 16 up here and by 8 and then
maybe another by 16 right there
so check and see if that's the case it
doesn't hurt to use 16 if you can but I
also don't think it's gonna hurt to use
8 next question vagin 64 says we're
vegan 64 I guess in this case
says with all your research how much
data did you produce in 2017 and
gigabytes I don't have an actual number
on that for the data collection from
testing I have a number on it for media
production things like that and gets
complicated because we we compress our
video files sort of once they've reached
a certain age point but we keep them
around it's fairly lossless and we also
delete our a roll files once they're
rendered into a video so it would be a
lot more but as of today I think we've
used about 10 terabytes in the last year
or so and then just reduced that by
about a terabyte today by running one of
our scripts so we can control it pretty
well using the compression scripts and
and getting rid of stuff that we
definitely don't need anymore has
allowed us to keep the same set of hard
drives for years at this point rather
than just adding on infinitely more and
more hard drives it's a lot of cost
involved in that a lot of maintenance
things like that so just easier to
organize stuff get rid of what we
definitely don't need and and then
compress everything else test data
definitely is in the hundreds of
gigabytes if you start counting the
captured videos for things like VR and
console benchmarking it's even more
hundreds of kilobytes getting two
terabytes range for the last year but we
do try and compress those as well got a
couple more here that a quick Street
guru I finally remembered what happened
to the Radeon SSG could the effect of
one terabyte of VRAM be good for miners
did they realize that the ten people
with red wasn't going to be enough of a
customer base so the Radeon SSD is
available you can buy it on B&amp;amp;H photo
and a couple other places it's like
seven thousand dollars it targets a
professional market I don't know what
kind of sales volume they have but it's
out there and you can buy it
the bigger part of the question though
and I think we can all agree the more
important one is how does it do for
mining well given the deterrent GPU
storage and the mining demand for cards
I would like to think that if I say the
cards very good at mining they'll all go
by the $7000 card and leave the other
ones alone so we'll just pretend that's
the case
in reality I did actually talk to some
people have this question I thought it
was kind of a funny one to bring out so
despite having 1/2 hair by the vram and
please if you know a lot about crypto
mining let me know below what you think
but I talked to some people and from
what I understand crypto mining is more
bandwidth intensive than it is capacity
intensive I don't know if there are any
algorithms where that's not the case
while they also remain profitable on a
$7,000 card but if they are not capacity
intensive then in fact SSD storage will
be lower bandwidth than the 16 gigabytes
of HP m2 that's on the card and at that
point you might as well buy Vega
frontier or 64 or whatever if you're
really doing mining and looking for
bandwidth because I think it'd probably
be about the same or better especially
for the $7,000 price although the gtx
1080i will soon be priced at that same
level so anyway if you know where the
capacity might come into play with my
name let us know in the comments I'm
just kind of curious at this point last
one not twist said an EVGA tech
suggested I should remove the cooler off
my 1070 TI replace remove all the
thermal pads and replace them with an
actual thermal compound is this a bad
idea yes it is most certainly have had
idea and I'm sure that's just a one-off
instance but don't do that it's a home
don't pads are there because they're
thicker they're not runny
they don't really age the same way it
will sit there always as a gap to or to
bridge the gap between the components
and thrown paste is not there
specifically because it probably isn't a
good application so I would say if you
have to replace them and buy more
thermal pads and replace it with those I
don't know what the the technician was
thinking but last one we had some fanart
from someone without a screen for a
second and that's it for this time they
were watching you could subscribe for
more as always go to patreon.com/scishow
so you can get the second part of this
ask g and it'll just be a couple more
questions if I do that or Reese more
frequently in the near future so as
always thanks for watching I'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
