Donna and I am again joined by page Dino
pillow spews hi everyone and today we're
talking about insurgency as made by a
new world interactive insurgency is the
follow-up to the steam the source mod
released on Steam a couple years ago
insurgency modern infantry combat and to
give a very quick synopsis of the first
insurgency it was a highly realistic
slow slug fest one shot one kill type of
gameplay f it's obviously it's an FPS
and it was one of the first mods
officially released on steam for
download so it got pretty popular
insurgency to they want to make it more
accessible it's a little bit less
realistic so it's got a lower barrier to
entry and that all goes to the feel of
the game as the the team put a heavy
emphasis on making sure the game
actually plays fluidly but doesn't
restrict players one of the cool things
about this is that there's a very
limited pud but carries over from the
first I ns2 this one do you're mostly
just looking at pretty much the map and
your gun there's not a lot else going on
it's really hard to tell when you get
kills nothing there's no kill feed that
you've got like a little bit of
information about your gun but other
than that it's just you're in the game
and you're playing it very slow pace the
maps are fairly large really intricate
so you'll end up you know meandering
through a map for quite a bit of time
before you get to an objective and then
from there it's about finding if anybody
is there where they're at and then going
through short periods they'll probably
like frantic combat then after that it's
back to me entering or if you're dead
you're waiting to for the next spawn
wave to go out so it really just depends
on kind of how it goes for you which is
why the team works so important because
the spawn points are far away from the
objective so once you get there you
really don't want to die first you owe
you want to get something done so that
kind of goes back into their whole
everything's of a very team-based and
objective based and when you do get into
combat scenarios it is it's still a
couple shots to kill it's not quite as
ridiculous as insurgency one but like I
mean if you round a corner and you shoot
a guy in the thigh he's probably dead
we're more than likely some guns are a
little bit more powerful than other guns
but at the same time I think most of
them are semi-automatic they've got a
few that are one shot burst guns but the
ones that you can just spray chances are
you'll unload the whole thing into a
dude because you won't even think about
the fact that he's gonna die after the
first two but you're used to
person in order to kill them yeah and
the actually on the HUD you were talking
about the HUD being kind of minimalistic
it doesn't even tell you how many
bullets are left in your chamber it
tells you magazines yes oh so that is
sort of cool I don't know if the to be
honest I'm not one hundred percent sure
if the reloading is actually magazine
based or round based but it does
definitely only display magazines which
is kind of interesting from a realism
standpoint have you ever run out of ammo
I don't think I've ever been alive long
enough I have okay I have my mother
after doing some brief testing I would
like I'd shot I shot one bullet and
reloaded and shot one bullet and the
magazine count wasn't going down so I
think there's some kind of rounds based
paint underneath and speaking of weapons
everything is done through a point
system so first all you have different
roles for the players when you spawn
into the server you select a role and
thats things like basically that the
archetypes are you know a saboteur like
a bomber or support with an LMG or recon
and snipers and stuff like that and then
once you select one of those you have
your points for the actual gun loadout
okay so basically points they comp
supply you get ten to put towards your
kit you can have a primary weapon a
secondary weapon an explosive armor
nervous now you don't have to have all
of those things everything costs a
certain amount of point gun attachments
also cut costs a certain amount of
points and some things are free so it
really just depends on how you want to
build your kit one important thing to
note is that generally you want to carry
an explosive almost all of the objective
game types require you to destroy a
cache and without a/c for a grenade or a
rocket launcher you can't you can't
destroy anything so you basically get to
an objective and you're just kind of
like well i'm here if anybody else wants
to join me okay good we just unload my
magazine into the cache yeah you can't
you can't destroy it with your bullets
uh-uh so it's it's you have to have
something to throw at it not all classes
have the ability to have a c4 or rocket
launcher generally you're only gonna
have a grenade given to you and if you
don't carry the right vest then you
can't have two grenades you only have
one grenade that would be me you're just
right you're just a ticking time bomb
anyone else do you need do the objective
yeah you people has the security and
then the insurgents so
if you're the security it's always our
was insurgents we kept yelling Freedom
Force hey yeah it's jet you either play
as freedom where you play as the bad
guys and all the maps are based and
basically you know somewhere in the
middle east and the the maps are there
fairly large there a little bit
confusing they they appear much larger
they're almost bigger on the inside than
the outside because the buildings have
all these yes totally pointless yeah
yeah we nicknamed a building on district
the infinite building because there's at
least five or six staircases and so many
hallways that have bedrooms and then
another small hallway and then a
bathroom and you're like why did I come
all the way over here there's no reason
to be here and yeah you could camp there
but like it's not going to accomplish
anything and it's cool it's like cool
from a realism standpoint but from a
gameplay standpoint and mechanics always
win over realism it's just it's
unnecessarily complex so you end up with
a lot of unused space on the map it's
mostly also because you'll you'll see an
objective on your map and you'll be
trying to get there and then you'll go
through a hallway going Oh clearly this
is going to lead me to this point and
then you get stuck if it ended and
you're like oh okay and then you try to
back to track down a staircase and you
realize you're halfway across the map
and you're like I don't even know how I
got here so you go back in the building
goes on the different hallways and
you're like a magic of the internet bill
it's so fucking few this extra
dimensional game modes we had some
issues with some of the maps should not
exist in some of the game modes because
they just don't play well with each
other but I think age is it all maps are
available on all game modes did we
decide that yeah the only difference is
that i think in co-op mode there's one
map you can't play on but pretty much on
all the multiplayer game modes they're
all same map save em gave us our own and
and that does have some balance issues
especially on modes like push where
you're playing best two out of three
it's really unfortunate the way they
designed it because you play as the same
team for all three or all two of those
rounds so in games like counter-strike
you're switching every other you know
you switch at the halfway point between
the the match so
you can play as the other team that way
if there's a balance issue its
counteract because you you both get to
play as that team and this it's it's
just it's 22 rounds of offense and
you're like great we can never break a
we haven't for the first ten minutes and
we won't for the next yeah so that is
one of the downsides I guess overall I
kind of I like the game I would always
personally go play counter-strike go
before insurgency but insurgency does
have some cool points because it's kind
if you like call of duty 4 on PC and you
miss having that around it has some
similar elements in terms of speed from
call of duty 4 but then it also has
these really tactical like you have to
slow down and kind of camp a corner
aspects of counter-strike go and it is
on the source engine so that makes sense
Paige what are your overall thoughts I
liked it I know that every time you try
to get me to play go I was like but can
we plan certain see instead I'm still
trying to get over from playing on the
console in this game this game was easy
wasn't easy but it was fun to play quick
to pick up fun to play with other people
but it also i guess wasn't so much that
you're playing against a bunch of other
people who were really good to the game
and you were bad at the game everyone
kind on the same basic level it's a lit
since it's so teamwork based it doesn't
you don't get those people who go in and
get 50 kills I think the most kills I've
seen on this game so far 18 and that's
pretty hot most people average around
court at eight and that's like in a good
game where everything's kind of balance
and you see a lot of likes like actual
actual fighting at like certain
objective points and not just like oh I
got killed going across the street and I
have to wait for my next bond with all
of that yeah and this is a really good
point you actually a lot of the time you
don't end up getting up a ton of kills
and around especially if you're playing
properly and going for objectives so you
can be zero kills and four deaths and
still win because you actually blow up
the objectives for your team I would say
it is probably worth buying it's only
like fourteen or fifteen dollars or
something that runs on the source engine
if you like source games you'll probably
like this it's basically counter-strike
except with sprinting and more damage so
the game can be frustrating like with
the
apps and game mode mismatch but on the
whole it's a pretty good game for
fifteen dollars it's it's probably an
easy pickup unless you really hate the
like hardcore mode of you know a couple
shots to kill but otherwise otherwise
I'd say it's pretty good so that is all
