GN it might be a little bit of bad code
because we're in a cable car we're a
gondola going peak to peak at Whistler
this our last day here after PAX West
drove up and we'll put a timer somewhere
in the corner because I'm on a clock for
this before we get to the other side
before that this coverage is brought to
you by the core g21 enclosure from
thermal take a $70 case with two four
millimeter thick tempered glass side
panels and a power supply shroud with
top mounted SSD sleds learn more at the
link in the description below
okay so STM first question enigma one
asked Steve what's the latest on
hardware Lux is Vega 56 under bolt
validation so that comes from the
livestream Vega 56 under volting kind of
works but sometimes it doesn't so in
that live stream you can see that I
wasn't able to successfully replicate
the results that doesn't mean the
results didn't happen it means that my
car didn't like those numbers and
specifically here's the thing it looks
like it accepts the under bolt but if
you take a DMM to the back of the card
multimeter and check the voltages it'll
actually be a bit higher than what you
tell it to run it so that's expected but
the voltage wasn't dropping as much as
we were telling it to so it looks like
it's working but it's just I'm not fully
confident in it basically I think the
software it's kind of lying to us like a
lot of other things with via the Vegas
software so I'm not sure about the
results they could be completely valid
but we can't replicate it under Bolton's
just like overclocking some silicon
likes it some doesn't next question for
him says Steve I have a question
regarding memory bandwidth and GPUs
different graphics cards can have
different bandwidth like 200 300 400
gigabits per second or gigabytes per
second rather what does that
specifically mean how much data the GPU
can move per second or something else
because higher bandwidth doesn't
really mean faster cards so as quickly
as possible this is the speed at which
the GPU can maximally move data to and
from memory some GPUs care a lot more
about memory bandwidth than others you
can look at the Vega GPUs they get
choked on bandwidth which is provable by
overclocking the HBM and basically what
it comes down to is well let's do the
calculation first so to calculate many
memory bandwidth do you take the memory
bus width divided by 8 which converts
your bits to bytes makes a bit easier
and then you multiply that by the memory
clock the actual clock drop the
effective 1 times 2 for ddr times 2 for
gddr5 and some architectures are more
bound than others so depend what number
you get they may not mean anything that
may mean a lot with Vega we tend to be
limited on bandwidth with Furio tend to
be limited this is getting very high up
and then with some of the Nvidia cards
it behaved a bit differently Nvidia
doesn't need the bandwidth quite as much
as the bigoted architecture does part of
that is the color compression memory
compression so as you push and pull data
from memory if you can compress a lot
more of that data you can compress the
colors 8 to 1 even stuff like that then
you really reduce your reliance on that
pipe being wider the memory bandwidth
being larger and in numerical value so
the more compression you have the better
off you are higher memory bandwidth
doesn't mean better card but it is
important for some architectures
especially all eventually at some level
a quick example though when I wrote down
here we take a gtx 1060 that's 192
gigabytes per second memory bandwidth
192 bit bus the equivalence between this
two numbers is basically a coincidence
so 192 divided by 8 equals 24 times 8
gigabits per second effective you get
192 gigabytes per second or if you're
working from base frequency which makes
more sense that would be 2002 megahertz
so 192 divided by 8 24 times 2002 gives
you 48,000 48 times 2 for DDR 96
gigabytes times 2 for gddr5 192
for a second so that's a quick
explanation of memory bandwidth think
we're about halfway through this video
oh yeah compression matters a lot but
that's that's the very basics maybe
we'll do something separate when I'm
like not in a car doing this as Street
guru these are all from discord today
says should Andy add an automatic under
boat utility to wat man we're in the GPU
would where and the GP would render a
scene at a user-specified frequency say
1600 megahertz or Vega then gradually
scaled down the voltage until it sees
instability where it hopefully stops
itself to prevent a crash all the data
could then be output to a file where the
user could set States and white man
accordingly this is a fantastic idea
I hope AMD takes your idea so vote
frequency tuning exists in precision and
in the NVIDIA Pascal and onward cards
there is a volt frequency curve for AMD
also it exists a lot more in Vega than
in previous article textures so it's
possible for them to do this and I would
think you'd basically run it through a
bunch of checks at different and take a
while run through different frequencies
and voltages see where it's not stable
and output your results from there and
then load them if you want to load them
and if you I don't know I think the
challenge is how do you recover from the
driver crash how do you save the stage
do you put it out to a text file for the
user or do you try and do it all for
them that's the challenge but they have
plenty of other things to work on on the
driver side so not sure that'll come
anytime soon but I next question is from
contractor three one six who says Steve
do you know if there's any qualitative
performance and/or power consumption
difference between using a single split
PCIe cable or two separate PCIe cables
to power the graphics card and what's
the effect on the power supply so not
really so this is just you don't really
want a daisy chain cables that's what
you're talking I was where you get one
that splits we did that in the cooler
master C 700p built that we did at PAX
this past weekend and I did it because
it was cleaner but I mean if you're
trying to be technically correct using
two separate cables would be
it's just a matter of are you exceeding
the amount of power that the gauge of
that cable can handle generally the
answer's no you're probably going to be
fine
but if you're working with say an
overclocked tin pin card or high
overclock lightning Z something like
that you're pushing enough power where
it's probably time to use two separate
cables reduce the heat load on the
cables so that you're not burning
through your wire by pushing 300 Watts
through it or something like that and
they can handle more than the PCIe spec
says that they can handle but there's
really there's no reason to to beat the
cables up like that if you can run an
extreme overclockers high overclock
you'll improve your stability a little
bit as you approach the upper limit of
the cables you'll reduce the heat load
on that specific cable rails come into
play here to 12 volt rails maybe we can
get builds or to talk a bit about that
sometime the future and do some
demonstrations of what happens when you
do use a daisy chain cable can you make
it catch fire or melt or anything like
that you can it just depends on what
kind of hardware you're working with and
if you are well the demonstration parts
are because you don't want it damaged
the high end card obviously I can
produce that much current and power so
that's the concern with that but yeah I
think it just comes down to like if
you're working with lower wattage cards
you'll be fine with a daisy chain but
just try to do two separate cables so
that's mostly questions I had here for
today and this thing is still going so
we can add a couple more let's talk
about the under bolting a bit more and
so the backlit card under bolting the
first question that I talked about will
have a I can put a photo have Andrew put
a photo in the video of the voltage
checkpoints on the back and you can
check for HBM to voltage that you can
check for vcore so take the you know I'm
the DMM take the black and stick it into
a ground on a molex cable that's
probably the easiest you want to be as
close to the sword as possible and then
take the red and probe the back of card
you can check the HBM to voltage you can
check v core they will be a little bit
higher than what software tells you
because just because we're you're
checking of a stage but that will give
you a better idea of if your voltage is
actually changing from the one under
bolting this is probably more accessible
than the other solution which is take a
current clamp clamp the cables and check
the current ideally you do both to make
sure that the power actually goes down
which tends to coincide with voltage
because volts times amps equals watts so
you see one go down probably the other
one went down but just to really make
sure check the voltage on the back of
card you'll see a bit higher than
software but it should go down each time
you step it down and software relative
to each other so if you drop 10
millivolts you should drop 10 millivolts
in the back of the card readout or
roughly there about so that would be
something I'd suggest we'll have a photo
to show you where you check those
yourself if you want to remove the
backplate and you're good to go on that
we're approaching the end here I think
so if you want to check out content that
was from Whistler like a bike park check
the G on Steve channel we'll leave a
link below you can subscribe to that one
thing we're gonna start building that
one up a little bit more for non-gamers
Nexus content stuff that's like kind of
related like the riding down the
mountain while talking about coffee lake
and things like that
that's probably the most related we'll
get so check out the GN Steve channel
