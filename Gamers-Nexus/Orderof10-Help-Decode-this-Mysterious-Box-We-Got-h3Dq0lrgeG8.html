box in the mail and I need your help
figuring out what it means a couple
things here this thing is it's a
briefcase it's got this sticker on it
that has one of these on the sticker
with the number 10 in the middle of it
and this is the sort of heart of the box
it's a metal triangle all black with a
code printed here and then it's got
something here that I'll tell you what
that is in a moment the code if you take
that code and redeem it which i did
because this card told me to which also
came in the box the card says to redeem
it at order of 10 calm / horizon
dilation make sounds like a medical
procedure so you go there you redeem the
code which I've done and that takes you
to the page that we're looking at right
now on the screen and this page has six
pieces one of them at the time of
filming this was still missing and that
is from another editor as far as I'm
aware six editors have received one of
these we are one of them I know
SlashGear has at least one I know
engadget has one and I've got a couple
of suspicions about the other folks who
might have it the hashtag is order of 10
which I'm sure most of them have posted
them there by the time this video has
gone live so there are five pieces
currently available and I don't know
what they mean I know it comes from our
hardware vendor and I'll tell you who I
think it is in a moment the order in
clockwise fashion from top around the
pieces are collision and this references
Einstein the letters in the bottom right
you look in the bottom right of each of
these pages you'll see some letters
those letters for this page are j k l m
so it's alphabetical the next one is
structure that's the URL referencing the
Hinton's tesseract and the letters for
that one RN o P Q and next is circles
that's referencing the time machine by
hg wells and there's a note here that
says hg wells and scientists were
inspired by him suits they're basically
saying this order of 10 thing isn't just
all scientists there are other members
like hg wells and hg wells in this
instance they're saying inspired
scientists and i have a note on that in
a moment I looked up who he inspired and
she did a bit the letters for that when
our RS
you the piece I got to this piece here
is compute so if you actually look at
this piece and you look in the corner
here then you look in the bottom left of
the image on the website this fits their
perfectly that's the one we got everyone
has one of these sort of barcodes on the
side and those line up with each other
and create some sort of letters so they
create letters basically on the page so
that's our peas we got compute okay so
we know it's a GPU vendor quite
obviously computes a thing that they
like to talk about so ours is compute
and our piece references that live in
its and the binary number system and our
letters were vwxyz and then the last
piece that we currently have is vision
which references herman thats nelons eye
chart and that's the piece that chris
bar from SlashGear got and his letters
are ABCDE okay so i'll tell you what
i've found so far in this thing and i'll
let you all sort the rest because i'm
just not smart enough to figure this out
on my own so first of all hg wells his
page on this site says that he inspired
to scientists one of those two
scientists is fer me fer me if you
haven't figured it out is one of the
code names for NVIDIA GPU architectures
that includes the 400 series pretty hot
architecture a couple years ago that was
Fermi of course after that was Kepler
than mass Maxwell and next is Pascal so
obviously there's a science theme here
and after Pascal's supposed to be Volta
so quite obviously at Nvidia at this
point and the next thing I sort of
figured out what Orwell started to
figure out was that on the collision
page there's a couple of numbers and
they're in almost like a hopscotch chart
I'm sure someone actually does what that
is I don't but it's the numbers are 9 18
27 1714 for the first chart and the one
at the bottom of the page the numbers
are 10 5 9 16 and 15 so these seem to
correspond to one of the other pages and
that page
is the hg wells page so if you go to hg
wells page you'll see that these boxes
are present and they're missing the
numbers but imagine these numbers fill
in those blanks and they correlate or
correspond to something else if you look
up the quote on the hg wells page you
can sort of google search the first
sentence and you will find the freely
available chapter from the book that
this is referencing and the missing
words are on that page whether or not
they fill in this this puzzle I'm unsure
but maybe that will point some of the
right direction the next thing I figured
out or rather a friend of mine figured
out the vision page which is the one
that /q got seems to correspond with our
compute page this is for a few reasons
one of course these all seem to be
related somehow by their edges and two
if you look at the vision page the
vision chart actually almost perfectly
basically perfectly fits the chart
that's on our computer binary number
system page you could put them side by
side which I'll do and you'll see how
they relate to one another is that's
almost everything I got I checked the
source code of the pages I couldn't find
anything that was obvious they were a
little bit too smart and concealing
things I really wanted to note that last
clue was and I could not figure it out
without the person actually redeeming it
so whoever the other editor is please
type that number in the the next thing
I've got is this so there's this little
package that came in the box and it says
these words it says we are the
inquisitive the codebreakers the truth
seekers got some illuminati stuff going
on here for centuries we have studied
the patterns that govern the universe
and the rules that drive our perceptions
of reality we toil in secret pushing the
boundaries of possibility keeping our
work underground until the world is
ready the day has come melodramatic we
are calling on you and your followers to
join us on a mission to unleash a
quantum leap forward a power so great
mysterious dot dot dot it will change
the way we see so i don't know if that
references vision or what but in this
box is one of six keys follow the trail
and reap the rewards game every
same so they've broken their illuminati
stuff with that little game everything
there at the bottom and then it says
order of 10 like everything else so
that's the note i got this was the
redemption card i thought i was a genius
and pulled out this foam from the box
and discovered a hidden compartment
which had advertisements for the company
that made this box and I'm not gonna not
going to show this their relevance and
keys so there's nothing else special in
there it's just this and the stuff that
I told you about the website so the
website where you can help me is linked
below and of course you can read our own
content on this as we figure stuff out
check gamers Nexus not met or the social
media pages and we will interact with
you all trying to work on this today
quite obviously Fermi is mentioned very
distinctly it's about scientists
excellent video card is Pascal scientist
so we know that much but that's about it
thank you for watching if you have ideas
post them below because I'm curious and
I can't figure it out because i am not
that good at this type of thing so as
always at patreon link the petrol video
comments below if you want help us out
and i'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
