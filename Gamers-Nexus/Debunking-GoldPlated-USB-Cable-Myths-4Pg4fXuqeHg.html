dotnet and today we were talking about
this this is a gold plated USB cable I
bought on Amazon gold-plated and the
reason I use scare quotes is because it
is marketing BS I bought this only so I
can show you to not buy it so I took a
hit for you you're welcome
let's talk about why gold-plated cables
for USB is complete marketing BS why you
should never buy it first of all this
cable is plated only on the outside
there are no gold plates on the inside
on the pins you know the things that
actually connect to the computer the
receiving pins are what connect to the
pins here the plate on the outside is
only to protect the house the USB you
can actually remove this this housing
the metal housing and it would still
work because it doesn't carry a signal
this cable on Amazon was advertised as
improving the signal and decreasing the
latency and with keyboards a lot of the
time you'll see companies say it's
gold-plated it decreases the latency so
your keyboard inputs faster so there's
less lag between keystrokes and that's
why it's better for gaming don't listen
to that it's BS and aside from the fact
that a lot of them are only plated on
the outside which carries no signal to
begin with and therefore it cannot
decrease latency and cannot improve the
signal the ones that are gold-plated on
the Pens they're plugging into a system
that isn't gold-plated on the receiving
side so metallurgically it might
actually be worse for the the cable in
the long run because it's not a like to
like connection it's it's aluminum or
whatever on gold and let's say
everything is gold let's say it's
receiving gold-plated it's going in
gold-plated
even then there are so few pins on USB
it's five for USB three so few pins it's
not gonna make any difference whatsoever
in the accuracy of the signal in the
latency of the signal and besides
keyboards aren't exactly high high pull
rate devices anyway you might get a
thousand Hertz or something it's not
like a video card where you have dozens
of pins and they need to be played gold
they need to be really accurate and it's
operating that gigahertz right so it's a
lot faster on a video card CPU it makes
sense to have gold pins because there
are thousands of pins and they need to
be accurate they need to be fast its
operating at several gigahertz
this is not fast it doesn't need to be
as accurate because frankly it doesn't
produce the level of output that
something like a CPU does which is on a
completely different level
technologically and the gold plating
really is just to make you spend more
money so do not buy gold plated
connectors simply because it says gold
plated if you're buying it because the
cable as a whole in the case of audio
equipment is better great do that maybe
audio equipment analog equipment that
stuff it can make sense your gold plated
for completely different reasons
normally because it's tied with the
thickness and the quality of the cable
inside USB don't go out and buy this
just because it's gold-plated by any
other USB connector you can buy these if
it's cheap anyway like why not but don't
expect it to be faster don't go around
saying your keyboard is low latency as a
result of it
so that is why gold plated connectors
are BS and why you should not be
spending more money for them and audio
is a little different but I will see you
all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
