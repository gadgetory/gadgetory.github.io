showcased an X 470 motherboard from
gigabyte with the m4 socket of course
just with an updated chipset and some
changes post rise and launch
so as the motherboard vendors have been
ironing out their side of Rison and the
two has been working on their next
iteration of verizon the Rison 2 or as
it's been called sometimes Rison plus
family of CPUs which will exist on the
zen architecture not Zen - but a Zen
architecture and also there's news on
Raven Ridge the APU integration of the
Zen or Rison core complexes and the Vega
GPU so I'll be talking about that
briefly today before that this coverage
is brought to you by Thermaltake and the
flow liquid cooler the flow is a 360
millimeter radiator with three ring RGB
LED fans you can program the fans our
custom lighting through software and
then of course benefit from the larger
radiator size and cooling performance
learn more at the link in the
description below this one's gonna be a
quick one for us we didn't go to the AMD
tech day but we collected the
information separately most of our early
efforts were focused on the x4 70
motherboard which is one of the first
one that's been shown officially you can
find that out on our channel by gigabyte
so the main information here especially
as it pertains to Raven Ridge and the AP
is is that the architecture as expected
is focused on power savings this is
something Andy's been big on it with
Rison and the Zen architecture in
general and they've had some trouble
with it with Vega but combining the two
is a bit different than just Vega stand
alone on the big d GPU PCB so combining
them Vega and risin as expected will
communicate via and these high speed
interconnect which they call infinity
fabric and that also bridges to them the
system IO via the chipset and the
integrated memory controller the IMC so
all these things are bridged together
via infinity fabric and then the other
kind of major changes there are
pertaining to precision boost
- which is what Andy is calling its
updated version of its boost technology
for Zen so the boost technology
primarily has hinged on the things you
would expect how much current is going
to the CPU on the GPU side you're
looking at current voltage power
consumption and thermals and a lot of
the same stuff is true for the CPUs so
we look at these elements for precision
boost - with the addition of
implementing a new volt frequency curve
where unlike with Zen one where you had
very hard to set frequencies for core
utilization you use one core versus two
versus all of them there's a very
defined almost binary toggle between the
frequencies unlike that now it's a more
gradual gradient for the frequencies
versus the core utilization and the
voltage so that's a big change they have
charts for that where you can see it's
it's kind of a as you increase core
count it kind of asymptotes out at the
bottom so that's different and it's
somewhat mirrors what Intel has been
doing not to say that Andy and Intel are
copying one another but that this is
clearly one of the more optimal ways to
configure your core frequencies versus
your power consumption another item here
is that AMD is looking at which thread
is under the most demand so the thread
under the most active load is the one
that will get the most power sent to it
or the most current sent to it so they
are modulating based on that not just
based on a hard lookup table or
something like that further the power
between the CPU and the GPU package are
allocated based upon the current
requirements of the applications running
so AMD is using firestrike as an example
here on one of their presentation slides
which makes a great example because fire
strike for 3dmark fire strike it has a
few tests it's got graphics tests and
physics tests physics uses almost zero
graphics compute and graphics uses very
little CPU so between the two you can
see the power allocation go up for the
Vega components the graphics component
during
the graphics test you see the allocation
go up for the CPU component during the
physics test which means that they're
able to min/max their power and current
budget because you can't just push all
of it through to both components they
don't have the budget for it so you pick
and choose to fit the smaller thermal
and power consumption limitations of
these Raven Ridge chips and that's what
they're doing here and they're able to
dynamically regulate where the power and
the current is going based on the load
of the CPU at that time or the GPU as it
were and the unfortunately some of their
slides aren't all that helpful they are
employing the bigger bar better
mentality for them where you've got a
y-axis with no label well that have a
label but no numbers an x-axis with no
numbers so it's just sort of nebulous
infinitely going in each direction with
no actual understanding of what it means
which is very unfortunate because it's
an interesting slide otherwise but this
is something we'll look at more in
testing later on just like we talked
about when Rison launched AMD is still
using LDOS or low dropout regulators for
their power management and the LDOS here
double as power gates so they can turn
things on and off based on the current
needs of the system this goes to the
extreme of being able to disable 95% of
the GPU if it's not needed which of
course is really important for any kind
of mobile chip because you care a lot
about battery life and if you have a GPU
sitting there burning power waiting to
be used
you're just burning battery life so they
can paragate down to 95% of it off and
they can further power gate with GPU
uncor so all of the uncor components
things like cash would be mitigated in
their consumption as well and save more
power power gating for SOC functions is
split into two containers so they begin
to slide for this one where the
containers are the theirs they label
them a and B one of them contains the
CPU interface the GPU interface and the
i/o hub that would be all in one and the
other one contains the multimedia hub
and the memory controller in a second
container and then these can be gated
based on which region or container they
are in they Assembly load of the system
to reduce power consumption further and
all of this allows a 99% residency on a
Windows idle screen static so they're
able to use very little power and just
sit there idle and have a lawn
standby life basically on the laptops
now we haven't tested this these are all
claims and their marketing slides but
some of this stuff's already out there
some of the rise in seven twenty seven
hundred you and the twenty five hundred
you compose have been out for a little
while now there are more coming forward
there's the well there's a couple things
interesting the r3 is twenty three
hundred you the twenty-two hundred you
are both coming out those are three
point four gigahertz boost and 2.0
gigahertz for twenty three hundred you
and two point five for the twenty two
hundred you they are twenty three
hundred years for core for thread with
six compute units and that would be 64 x
six for the streaming processors three
compute units for the twenty two hundred
you to court four threads on that one
other than these the roadmap has been
laid out as well for for the future for
AMD including a card that will compete
with Nvidia in the deep learning and
machine learning space so that will be a
new Vega GPU on seven nanometer process
the immediate road map however lists a
rise in three mobile APU for January
ninth aka now the horizon desktop AP use
for February 12th and second gen rise
and desktop processors in April which we
already knew from our earlier coverage
rise in Pro mobile quarter 2 and second
gen thread Ripper a lot of you were
interested in that second half 2018
second gen rise and pro so I can have
2018 other smaller items here included
the launch of the 400 series we already
covered that there have been some
changes to overclocking some of the
motherboard vendors have told us
directly that they are focusing on
better enabling piece date overclocking
not necessarily that useful but
soozee a thing that helps and then they
have some see be cooler updates and a
reduction permanent reduction in pricing
for rise in desktop CPUs going forward
for the ones that are out now so that's
what we have for you just a kind of
quick recap of the AMD news as we've
seen it you can find some more unique
coverage in our gigabyte X 470
