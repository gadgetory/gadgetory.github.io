few days ago but for some of you that
was not enough you wanted to know where
is the FT w3 well we didn't have one
then but we have one now this is the FT
w3 that just came in it is a three fan
cooler using the icx sensor placement
we've detailed previously and it is a
two slot cooler which in this current
generation of 10 ATI cards is not all
that common so we're going to taking
this apart today and I've been told it
is not easy to reassemble so not looking
forward to that but we're going to try
and document the teardown process so
that you can follow it yourself if for
some reason you needed to before getting
to the teardown this coverage is brought
to you by ifixit.com who provided the
tool kits for the job you can go to
ifixit.com slash gamers Nexus and use
code gamers Nexus for $5 off at checkout
and I have been told that they have a
tool kit that is called the PC
essentials toolkit it's a bit cheaper
than this one we're using the pro Tech
tool kit but it has fewer screwdrivers
and things like that and you can save a
bit of money more of the essential stuff
so let's get into the teardown here we
will be starting with probably the
backplate because that's where these
things normally start and although the
founders edition cards use a very tiny
Phillips screws for everything this one
looks like there what size is this in
the kit is called a 10 so we've got a 10
size 10 screwdriver
first of all Phillips screws for the
back plate strictly those feed into
other screws that kind of bolt through
the PCB and connect to the base plate on
the other side these four screws are
spring retention which spring retains
they go to the cooler proper and then
you can see there are some hex or allen
key screws in here for the faceplate and
that secures strictly the faceplate I
believe to the cooler proper along with
these spring retention screws that are
going to the base plate so these screws
actually keep the base plate attached to
the shroud and the cooler which
depending how you look at it is either
really nice or really annoyed I
tend to actually like it if you're only
trying to get to the card underneath and
not trying to dismantle the entire thing
because it's a bit more work to do that
there's a lot of screws actually and
these are very tight start in the middle
okay so three six 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
22 I think there are 22 total screws is
just for the back plate little excessive
EVGA just like the force required to
remove them under the tamper seal
alright this should be free now this is
held on by thermal pads I'm sure they've
gone a bit bit crazy with the thermal
pads lately which isn't necessarily a
bad thing alright so we're going to pull
the spudger and slice that okay I
already met with a cable one cable
number one so this is attached to the
led there's the back side of your chokes
and MOSFETs
these things will stretch if you're not
careful so I try to guide them as I
remove them and we're going to put this
that side down so backside cable that'll
be easy to remember something I could
have taken out of that one
this last one goes into a knot on the
other side so you have to hold that
while you remove it
okay the world's most screws for a back
plate award goes to EVGA all right cool
there's your back plate making contact
the EVGA back plates are among the few
we've tested that actually make an
impact on cooling that impact can be
both positive and negative
without the thermal pads we were seeing
somewhat of a heat trapping effect
previously with them we see that they
actually do they don't help with GP
diode temperature but they help with
temperatures elsewhere on the board or
if they do help with GPU diodes it's
very minimal and one of the EVGA icx
sensors is right there by the way not
the most useful place to take a
measurement but doesn't hurt to have the
extra sensor it does at least tell you
if the back plates causing problems or
not so that's nice to have a diagnostics
tool so this is ready to go free I think
we're going to remove the ones from the
back or the expansion area first two
three Phillips and then two of the DVI
hex heads which I think are slide maybe
a size four millimeter just that three
point eight five five millimeter
so on the magnetic mat we've got the
left side partitioned for the i/o I just
put all the bottom stuff down here
because I know where it goes I'm going
to save this space for anything
underneath because that's the stuff that
is going to throw me so now we're at a
place where we can pull this cooler off
try and pull with the PCB down so we can
leave as many thermal pads well actually
not let's do it this way so I think I
could rather have the throne beds come
off and stay on the cooler see a lot of
cables holding us in place okay so one
bottom left to right there but they
don't build it for you to take apart so
I'm not going to fault them it's just
more more stuff to keep track of
okay first ones free second one says lon
what two more all right so we've got
what is this over here
power power fans fans of three fans and
then a couple LED cables LED cable on
the back side which where's that part of
the backplate this one right here that
goes to the EVGA logo I think this is
all RGB LED if it if it weren't then it
wouldn't be 2017 so I think that's our
DB LED that's probably controllable
through software of some kind we'll look
into that later and then we've got if
you're curious to eight pin for the
power okay so for the cooler we've got
the cold plate here that you can see
I've lined it with the card so cold
plate GPU we've seen that before don't
need to clean it off to show you again
it looks like these are 8 ml heat pipes
under here which is a bit bigger than
some of the manufacturers to you
sometimes it do 10 but that's pretty
rare these days
sapphire attempts to do that the most so
heat pipes they're all pads for each the
DRAM modules including the missing on
which the
I've been keeping an eye on this the
same vram module is missing on every
single 1080 TI card we've opened so far
I was just curious if it's based on
anything they've disabled on the GPU or
why but same 1s so far for the Corby RM
there are a whole bunch of the e6
nine-30 packages which are dual end
MOSFETs
they combine high and low side sets
diode and a whole bunch of stuff in one
package but because of the thermal
solution which is actually like we saw
that c2 a topper heat pipe routed into
the inductor and MOSFET area
specifically actually this is you can
tell this is where the inductors go one
because the imprint and tube has been
dented the FETs go here and drive rice
these are in there as well so heat pipe
copper plate for pulling the heat away
and then capacitor banks right here
capacitor banks right here and then your
beer em so you six nine two zeros for
the feds if we count them up there and
we've got another VR em up here as well
if you didn't notice that one already
for shunts I've got sons here here and
here if you want to do a shunt mod and
short those that is where they are
located and the rest of it would be
visible by taking the base plate off
separately from the cooler so we can we
can try and do that it looks like it's
going to be held on just by these screws
in the corners here
okay one two three
okay got it so for this here's our base
plate oriental this way clearly and
we'll just go ahead and put that down
for a second so basically if I repeal
this up you would see more of the copper
plate that's what we looked at on the
other side if you remember heat pipe
there and that carries through to the
right side of the cooler which we can
show here yep carries all the way
through so heat pipe goes all the way
through over to here which really just
helps spread the heat out over a bigger
service area
utilize some more of that aluminum base
plate which does actually pull a
significant amount of heat off we show
that with the founders Edition cards as
well these these do a lot for you and as
long as there's an airflow of some kind
over them you'll keep the vram cold we
show that with our upcoming final Titan
XP hybrid mod these are the so-called
thin pins that's what EVGA names them
they are just aluminum standoffs that
add more surface area some wicking over
there would help you cool that as well
very tiny stacks here now how much do
these help I am Not sure that's not a
whole lot more surface area it's kinda
like Braille in terms of height it's not
a lot of surface area but in theory it
helps so that's what we have for the
base plate pretty straightforward for
the cooler
we've got really everything we already
saw the only new that new information
here well there's a few things actually
the heat pipes going from the GPU cold
plate to the vrm side of the cooler so
that's a significant amount this five
heat pipes right there of varying
thicknesses the two main ones here for
the vram and the GPU and then you can
also see these are those closed-off fins
while these are there's open ones these
are the new l-shaped fins that EVGA has
been doing actually right here as well
for the FET coin it improves service
area a bit when you're contacting with a
thermal pad as you can see here there's
actually a grill in the thermal pad
where those were contacting so the idea
is to leave them open enough that air
still gets through while improving
contact area to your transfer medium
which is a thermal pad because without
these if you're just going straight fins
which is what these ones are in the
middle straight fins a clearly less
surface area yes it does still work
we've tested it in the past with last
year's FTW they don't add testing does
still work but these work a whole lot
better and still allow for air flow so I
think that pretty much sums up the
cooler
other than the three fans which posture
if I even mentioned those so that's the
EVGA FTW three we will be testing this
separately as always thermal pads
everywhere as is the trend with EVGA
lately here's the PCB one last time so
it is a 2 slot cooler it's a bit
skinnier than some of the other stuff
we've tested like the extreme Oris and
the gaming ex same thickness as the SC 2
which we already reviewed the price on
the SC 2 when we originally reviewed it
was $720 it's gone up to 750 so kind of
along with everyone else now not as
special as it was originally this I'm
not 100% sure of the final price I think
it's going to be 780 in that case it is
one of the most expensive 1080i cards
that will be on the market perhaps
alongside some of the liquid cooled ones
like the Seahawk and theoretically a
hybrid when he when and if EVGA makes
one of those so it is an expensive card
now will it really do a whole lot for
you we'll find out in testing we'll have
a full review for you separately as
