recap for the week this week we'll be
talking on how Intel is apparently
planning to reduce its cpu prices in
response to the upcoming rise and launch
which would be a big milestone for Intel
because Intel is a company that has
basically never dropped its prices so
that well not for a long time anyway not
for several years generations Andy and
the x5 90 story and why X 590 is not
going to be a thing for this immediate
launch we'll talk about that more as
media delivery an AMD B 550 and a 520 as
we know them to be named now Intel and
Samsung are negotiating a manufacturing
contract and PCIe six along with some
more tariffs news before that this video
is brought to you by Dollar Shave Club
and their starter sets get your Dollar
Shave Club starter set for five dollars
by using our link below available
individually for shave shower or oral
care or all together in one package the
kits can be customized to your needs
with options including toothpaste and a
toothbrush hydrating shampoo face
cleanser and scrubs body wash or a razor
with cartridges and shaving cream
convenience is key and care packages can
be scheduled to send when you need a
restock go to dollarshaveclub.com slash
gamers Nexus or click the link below to
learn more so first a quick note by the
time this video goes live we'll have a
video featuring kingpin on the side
Channel and that is a bike check we look
at his electric bike that can go 60
miles per hour that was when we were in
Taiwan so fun video looking over some
bike technology that'll be on the GN
Steve side Channel and I'll link the
video below if you're interested in it
but it does feature overclocker and the
20 atti
kingpin namesake kingpin himself so that
should be fun for you Intel CPU
reduction in response or price reduction
in response to rise and a story went up
on tech power up in digit times on
Friday that indicated a CPU price
reduction by Intel motherboard
manufacturers have reportedly been told
by Intel that the Seabee prices should
reduce between ten and fifteen percent
depending on the CPU SKU and we don't
have a list of which ones will get the
15
cent cuts at this time but it's probably
going to correspond with whatever Rison
processors are nearby and how far intel
needs to come down to get close to those
prices maybe not match but we'll see so
for reference the 9900 Kay is on Amazon
in the u.s. at time of filming for four
hundred eighty five dollars a 10 percent
reduction would bring it to four hundred
thirty six dollars ish fifteen percent
might bring it down close to four ten to
four twenty so I doubt which retail you
look at some of them are more at five
hundred dollars instead of four eighty
five so that would get it sort of close
to the 3,700 X and 3,800 X which are the
eight core competitors two in tiles at
ninety nine hundred K those would be
four hundred dollars to the 3800 exits
it's quite distant from the 3700 X
actually which is three hundred thirty
dollars but the 3700 X it has a cash
difference versus the 3800 X so this
time aim these split them up in a way
that you can't just buy the lower down
skew and overclock and get everything
you had with the higher end skew so far
anyway but you could still overclock it
and aside from the other differences you
can get the frequency probably we would
assume almost certainly up to the 3100 X
there's no reason that wouldn't be true
so Intel's gonna have a hard fight ahead
of it and E is extremely competitively
positioned for this launch and a price
reduction is for the first time in a
while is genuinely necessary now Intel
doesn't have a new product coming out
for a long time the 9900 KS is the next
closest thing and that will be out till
probably towards the second well towards
the end of the year probably third
quarter but yeah so it's it's needed the
price reduction and if you look at old
Intel CPU inventory on new AG and Amazon
you'll notice that almost none of them
have been reduced in price over time the
retailers don't get any as far as we're
aware don't get a enough of a buyback or
any buyback which sometimes the
suppliers will offer for old inventory
so you end up seeing things like 7700 K
for sale at roughly the same price says
when it launched so this will be a big
move for Intel
and depending on what gets 10% and 15%
it might not even be enough so we'll see
how the competition stacks up in our
review we are getting the processors in
and obviously check back for that and
the axe 590 is actually X 570 so this is
something we received word on from a
couple of the motherboard manufacturers
when that story went live about a week
ago about an alleged and the X 590 that
was in the Bayeux century and some of
the motherboards out there so our
understanding what we were told is that
X 570 was originally going to be gen 3
PCIe and X 590 would have been Gen 4 and
all of this is long before launch we're
talking more than 6 months ago
so this happens all the time where stuff
changes it's just that typically the
public doesn't really hear about it in
any in any fashion so that was the plan
obviously X 570 ended up being Gen 4 so
X 590 doesn't need to exist anymore
there is a separate thread Ripper
chipset we don't know the name of it yet
it may very well end up being X 590 but
that would be different from the one
that was rumored and it would be
different because there would be an
additional for Gen 4 lanes going up to
the CPU so you move from 4 down upstream
to 8 between the CPU and the chipset and
that would be the change for thread
Ripper originally it was planned for X
570 and then it was changed later so
yeah X 590 won't exist in the form that
it was rumored but there will be a
thread room for chipset it'll be an
extra 4 PCIe lanes to the CPU and it's
not going to be for the m4 socket just X
574 am for Nvidia to support arm with
CUDA acceleration at the international
supercomputing conference Nvidia
announced that arm will receive the
support of the fold CUDA software stack
with a focus on AI and high performance
computing and video will work with arm
to power more energy-efficient
supercomputing and it works toward
assuring and exascale computing and
video will open its stack and offer arm
support for Nvidia CUDA xai HPC
libraries ai frameworks PGI compilers
and more with this announcement Nvidia
is officially supporting all major CPU
architectures at this time and
s CEO Jensen Wan sighted we need to
address a feature power limit as
computing advances a quote
supercomputers are the essential
instruments of scientific discovery and
achieving exascale supercomputing will
dramatically expand the frontier of
human knowledge as traditional compute
scaling ends power will limit all
supercomputers the accommodation of
Nvidia's CUDA accelerated computing and
arms energy efficient CPU architecture
will give the HPC community a boost to
exascale said Jensen want of Nvidia and
videos official support for arm is yet
another move into the realm of
supercomputing for NVIDIA the company
most recently purchased Mellanox an
Israeli chip maker that provides server
and networking hardware as well as
interconnect technology last week we
talked about why the am the x5 70
chipset is more expensive than X 470 we
also talked about why the motherboards
seem to be more expensive on average and
on average they are there are some
cheaper ones than the high-end ones that
we've looked at on the channel but
they're still a bit higher overall so
that discussion no doubt led to people
asking when B 550 and the follow up to a
series chipsets which we think is called
a 520 right now but the name may change
where when they will arrive is the
question the tentative answer as we said
at the end of last week's news episode
is supposed to be for the for 2020 and
it looks like digit x has repeated that
we heard first half of 2020 when we
originally spoke about this at CES and
recap this last week - and then digit x
has heard now early 2020 as an update so
a bit earlier than what we originally
heard digit items also reported that as
media is currently working on schedule
to finish the tape outs for the new chip
sets the B 550 chip sets an e 520
chipsets for silicon by end of year and
the opted to design x5 70 in the house
it's actually repurposing an i/o die
from Rison and using that for the
chipset and this was a departure from
the as media based chipsets in the first
and second gen Orwell - yeah first and
second gen Rison or Zen plus for the
architectures as media will be
responsible for and these budget
chipsets and may even net some
five seventy orders once it's pcie four
solutions are finalized there's also
speculation that beat 550 and a 520 will
skip PCIe for connectivity instead of
favori in 3.0 an attempt to meet the
pricing criteria and this is also
something we've heard by the way so PCIe
gen3 does reduce the price requirement
reduces the power requirement and
simplifies motherboard design it's
already been expected that a.m. these
entry-level boards will be more
expensive comparatively speaking than
the past but sticking with PCIe gen3
we'll see what happens we will have six
plus months to wait so we'll just wait
on that that said it wouldn't be
surprising to see AMD trying to keep the
pricing more affordable on the B and a
series chipsets Intel and Samsung are
negotiating a manufacturing contracts
but it's not for CPUs rumors began to
swirl earlier this week indicating Intel
and Samsung we're in talks to have
Samsung manufacturer Intel's 14
nanometer rocket Lake unsurprisingly
those rumors have been rendered false
what does appear to be in negotiations
between the two chip makers however is
chipset manufacturing according to Tom's
Hardware sources the talks between Intel
and Samsung are centered around a
simpler chips such as chipsets although
which chipset and which node would be
manufactured are currently unspecified
Intel has previously outsourced this
type of manufacturing before and as it
rolled back certain chipsets to 22
nanometers it would make sense for Intel
to continue to offload lower margin
products and focus on correcting its 40
nanometer shortage later this summer
we'll see the first PCIe 4.0 consumer
motherboards hit the market followed by
PCIe SSD s additionally just last month
the PC is IG ratified the PCIe 5.0
specification now PC is IG is already
looking down the road towards the next
specification PCIe
6 there was a long gestation period
between 3.0 and 4.0 and that's something
that PC is IG is aiming to avoid with
future protocol updates PCI 6.0 is more
in a draft state currently it is not
ratified PC is IG hopes to have the spec
finalized by 2021 and as has been the
case with the upgrade cadence 6.0 would
double the bandwidth
of previous versions based on
full-duplex the bandwidth progression
looks like it should be for a 6 X 16
slot an area should be PCIe 6.0 128
gigabyte per second if it persists so
that's the draft state right now again
not ratified not finalized for reference
5.0 is 64 gigabytes per second 4 point I
would be 32 gigabytes per second 3.0 16
gigabytes per second these are all by 16
and so forth
so a PCIe 6.0 will also be capable of 8
gigabyte per second speeds for an X 1
slot or by 1 pcie 2.0 by 16 wide slots
delivered that bandwidth in 2007 for
Reverand PCIe 6.0 will also see the
introduction of a new signalling
technology going from a non-return to 0
or nrz to a pulse amplitude modulation
or pam-4 as an intact notes the
signalling technology isn't unlike that
found in mlc nand and intech also offers
a thorough technical breakdown if that's
of interest to you and we'll link that
in our show notes below we could see
PCIe 6.0 available for general consumers
as early as 2023 if hardware vendors
move just as quickly to adopt the new
standard as they have in the past PCIe 4
was finalized in 2017 and we're just now
getting ready to see PCIe for products
in 2019 and it may go without saying but
price and bandwidth requirements will
also accelerate or decelerate the
adoption of PCIe 4.0 and consumer attack
next up consumer electronics and the
expected price chain increases we've
been talking about this for a little
while now behind the tariffs that have
been implemented recently so a new study
commissioned by the consumer technology
association or CTA highlights just how
much price tags are expected to inflate
with the 300 billion dollar tariff
proposal and that would include things
like phones tablets laptops gaming
consoles so forth all imported from
China
these are expected to rise significantly
in cost to the tune of 22% in some cases
we've also spoken with some component
manufacturers over the past couple weeks
there have been layoffs at a few of the
companies some of them not public yet
but EVGA was one that has been
publicized at this point so
and case manufacturers have been hit
with layoffs as well not sure if we can
name which ones those are just yet but
layoffs as a result partially in some
cases were entirely and others of the
tariff increase you'll see price
increases for some of the cases on the
market to the tune of about 18% the
manufacturers we spoke with are not
raising to match the 25 percent increase
for tariffs so it's going up to 25
percent tariffs now they're not matching
that for their price adjustments because
I don't buy the product it would be too
expensive so they're losing some margin
and they're increasing the price by
about 18% in the cases of those case
manufacturers we've spoken with as for
the CTA story phones coming in from
China are expected to increase 22% and
the new US average cost would rise 14
percent according to the report that
translates to a $70 price hike on
average similarly prices on notebooks
and tablets could rise as much as 21% or
$120 and a $50 increase on laptops and
tablets respectively gaming consoles
would also see a 21% increase in cost as
claimed by the CTA report and then
finally some of the companies are
pushing back on the tariffs so we're
reporting on this because it does affect
consumer pricing and that's important to
talk about companies are starting to
come out and show their opposition for
the looming tariffs set by the US
government the office of the u.s. TR US
Trade Representative is currently
holding public hearings on the tariff
proposals and companies such as Intel HP
Microsoft and Dell are making their
positions known the four companies
issued a joint statement that echoes the
concerns of the CTA study in that sharp
price increases on consumer tech will
have serious ramifications for both
consumers and US companies alike the
statement goes as far to say that the
tariffs could put laptops completely out
of reach for the most quote cost
conscious consumers the statement closed
by saying that although the tariffs
would disproportionately affect all
consumers including small businesses in
schools the most price sensitive
consumer would suffer the most
separately Apple and console makers
publicly commented on the tariff in a
joint letter Microsoft Nintendo and Sony
three companies that you don't often see
working together in the console space
noted that the tariffs would do the
following quarter to injure consumers
video game developers retailers and
console manufacturers put thousands of
high value rewarding u.s. jobs at risk
and stifle innovation in our industry
and beyond
additionally the letter addresses
concerns over the supply chain quote a
change in even a single supplier must be
vetted carefully to mitigate risks of
product quality unreliability and
consumer safety issues tariffs would
significantly disrupt our company's
businesses and add significant costs
that would depress sales of video game
consoles and games and services that
drive the profitability of this market
segment the letter reads Apple also
filed a comment Apple stated that the
tariffs would not only affect its entire
catalogue of hardware but would also
affect Apple's status as the quote
largest corporate taxpayer to the US
Treasury it's quite a quite a title to
hold this suggested that the tariffs
would stand to hinder its economic
contributions Apple also cited the fact
that Chinese competitors don't have the
same presence in America as US companies
have in China
meaning that us-based tech companies
would be more effected of the two and
