benchmarking scene is focused on testing
the AMD r7 1700 and the Intel i7 7700 K
CPUs on both the HTC vive and the oculus
rift headset we're plotting delivered
frame times dropped and synthesized
frames warp misses frame rate overall
and plane back Hardware capture of the
benchmarks in this set of tests VR
benchmarking is still new and
challenging to perform so we've limited
the tests to five games and four
configurations but even just running
those 20 total configs take
significantly longer than benchmarking
an entire GPU suite and must be preceded
with an explanation of VR testing before
getting set this coverage is brought to
you by the 1080 SC which has a new MSRP
that is it lowered with the launch of
the 1080i series at 1080 and 1060 SD
cards come with for honor or Ghost Recon
wildlands which you can choose at
checkout
learn more at the link in the
description below interpreting the data
in these charts today isn't necessarily
obvious this is a different type of
chart and the data has a different
significance than our normal test with
traditional benchmarking
so part of this is going to be
explaining what we're actually looking
at the first game benchmark that shows
up on the screen will explain what some
of the numbers are on the lines of the
bars and all that and then going forward
we'll be dumping a lot of the charts
from the games following the first one
which is dirt rally just because if we
put every single chart in this video
there would be 50 charts it'd take an
hour to go through them one minute at a
time so instead we're going to put only
the most pertinent data sets in this
video the rest as always will be linked
in the article in the description below
which will have pretty much every chart
you could possibly want including
individual breakouts of the two CPUs of
the TCPS overclocked hardware and
software monitoring and then the
comparative analysis which is what we're
mostly focusing on today in the video as
an intro to VR benchmarking our setup is
as follows we're using Hardware capture
of the headsets to intercept the footage
and send it to another machine this is
done in a way that does not impact
performance of the benchmarking system
and that's important since it's just
splitting the data a splitter box sits
between the capture machine and the
gaming machine and that feeds into a
$2,000 SC
hd4 card from vision which is capable of
accepting the high bandwidth from VR
headsets and also splitting things we
then use virtualdub to capture the
playback in the headset and on the
gaming machine and run color overlays
that bake into the output from the FCAT
VR suite
this can be later extracted to analyze
delivered and drops frames on a hardware
level and note also that you need a very
fast SSD or r8 SSDs in order to keep up
with the data because one minute of
testing can easily equal a 50 gigabyte
file we finally feed that file into our
own compression script which is creating
the files that you see in this video and
those are compressed down to a level of
hundreds of megabytes rather than tens
of gigabytes on the gaming machine we
use FCAT VR to intercept frame time
delivered frame rate drop frames and
warp miss data of note for today frame
times represent the time in milliseconds
between each frame delivery just like
always VR headsets at range from roughly
11 to 13 milliseconds for the time
required to deliver a frame before
encountering some sort of drop frame or
warp miss or other unpleasant action and
the extra 2 milliseconds there at the
end is really just an approximation
because the risk can do some funny
things at runtime
to help lengthen the amount of time
before the frame is required which is
generally 11 milliseconds if at 90 Hertz
refresh but there is some stretching
room after that the captured files look
something like what's on screen now at
which point we feed these into a
spreadsheet and into FCAT VR filter the
data and output the data you'll see in
the test later there are thousands of
individual data points for each test
which is one minute on and then the top
row is several very good variables long
as well so there's plenty of data there
to analyze and interpret the hard part
is figuring out what to do with all that
data once we've captured it
we have previous video explaining drop
frames and warp misses and what those
are if you're curious about those to
specific names as it pertains to VR
testing and in that video we also talked
about the VR pipeline so that goes
through this 11 millisecond window where
do you hit the run time when do you need
to have the frame ready and dispatched
and things like that so that's been a
previous content piece as for the
benchmarking itself for today the our
test execution is a big challenge so VR
testing in general is brand new
so we've been working on this for a few
months with FCAT VR and early iterations
but even with that experience it's not a
perfect setup so a few things here to
note first of all there's a major human
element with VR testing that cannot
really be easily resolved so it's not
only do we have to as usually execute
test passes which are fairly identical
more or less from one path to the next
but we have to do that while in VR with
a headset where you've got head movement
so the level of accuracy diminishes
compared to a standard benchmark where
you're just using a keyboard and mouse
and that's something we acknowledge and
basically use error bars in the graphs
and the bar graphs to show a margin of
error which right now is a bit wider
than I want it to be we're working on
it's sort of tightening the variance
between tests but there's only so much
we can do before you run into issues
with just VR in general not being a very
friendly platform to benchmark compared
to normal benchmarking so another
example of this outside of the human
element there's also a randomized
element with the games a lot of the VR
games right now
are king of the hill style stand in the
middle you attack enemies that spawn
around you those enemies are normally
randomly generated and depending on your
performance one run to the next it could
be that you see more enemies or fewer
enemies or whatever then in the previous
pass that's not a challenge now
fortunately we have enough data from
again the months of working on this to
know what the variance is and what the
margin of error is one pass the next
with the game and so we have that margin
of error bar on the charts it's not too
wide it's plus or minus 1.5 percent more
or less but that will give you an idea
of where the numbers fall or where they
could fall one pass the next the game is
benchmarks for today include the oculus
rift version of dirt rally oculus rift
version of elite dangerous and then we
have the HTC vive running raw data
Arizona sunshine and Everest if you're
curious about the test platform used and
the specs of the machine you can check
the article linked in the description
below but the most important element is
the GPU and that was our gtx 980ti
hybrid model that we built ourselves for
the first test we're starting with the
oculus rift and then moving on to the
vibe our rift
games include again dirt and a weed
we're testing dirt rally configured to
high settings with the event the
blending option enabled this first set
of charts will contain all the data we
have while subsequent games will only
contain a head-to-head data so they will
be simplified and faster to get through
for all of it if you want it for all the
games check the article below let's
start with the r7 1700 CPU at stock
settings only the left axis on this
chart shows frame times in milliseconds
lower is better here and we have a rough
11 millisecond window to deliver the
frame and the rift sometimes it can go
up a bit maybe around 13 of jamak the
magenta line represents the hardware
capture while the red line represents
the software capture the harbour capture
cannot see what's going on at a software
level and so only validates findings by
illustrating dropped frames never
delivered to the headset the software
line is more of what we're interested in
the lower third of the chart meanwhile
is an interval plot this one else has
visualized delivered synthesized frames
dropped frames and delivered at new
frames with everything explained now we
can start the data analysis for this
chart with the 1700 stock we can see
that the 1700 encounters a few dropped
frames or frames that were synthesized
by updating a head dragon in position
without a full update to the scene right
now we're playing a video playback of
the hardware capture for this run the
experience overall as seen in the
playback is smooth and the drops and
synthetic frames go unnoticed during use
we don't have enough to detect as a
human here that we can detect it with
tools and we'll talk about this more
going forward because again as a
reminder if you're at sixty seconds for
a test 90 Hertz that means you have
5,400 intervals so a couple drop frames
is not a big deal will show average
frame times an unconstrained FPS at the
end of this charted section next the r7
17 overclocked shows mostly the same
performance with one pretty bad drop at
the end of the capture but overall
nothing too critical
the time to deliver frames is now
shorter with the 3.9 gigahertz overclock
but there's no major difference in user
experience this next chart shows the
1700 stock and overclocked at the same
time where we can observe that the red
line representing the
values is consistently faster in frame
delivery than the yellow line or the
stock 1700 we are generally around 10
milliseconds for both devices but we'll
show that value more explicitly in a
moment and now here's the intel's i7
7700 kc view with stock settings Intel
CPU has a few drops but just like the r7
chip these are not appreciable to the
end-user frame times are closer to the
eight to nine millisecond mark with the
Hardware frame time spikes validating
the software measurements exactly at the
same moment we're playing some gameplay
of the Intel i7 7700 K benchmark now
where you'll notice that user experience
is smooth and without any significant or
noticeable hitches both CPUs can deliver
a smooth experience which is
subjectively to the human eye the same
but let's look at how they compare
objectively here's a chart showing the
seventeen hundred and seventy seven
hundred K heads ahead in stock
frequencies because we have standardized
this benchmark with the same head
movement we can see that the frame time
spikes generally aligned between both
CPUs Intel's faster overall in frame
time delivering this test with each CPU
dropping fewer than 20 frames throughout
the entire run it's not until drop
frames are significantly greater on one
config than the other that we'd actually
notice them so for all intents and
purposes the experience on each CPU is
the same that said Intel it's faster in
its frame times on this particular title
and experiences shorter spikes when the
going gets tough but let's look at a few
more charts first one more frame time
chart and then we'll look at the bar
graphs this one shows the two CPUs
overclocked until at four point nine and
a MDF 3.9 gigahertz both overclocks are
achievable on the majority of the
respective chips the drop frames are
similar again with the experience again
being effectively equivalent and these
closer to the 11 to 13 volt second
cutoff window but still within bounds
and so the experience is the same
interestingly and tell loses ground and
overclocking compared to the stock
benchmarks and we'll see that this
trying to repeat throughout the tests
let's get a bar graph on the screen for
better illustration this chart plots
delivered FPS to the headset which is
the most important metric then drop
frames of the second most important
metric and then unconstrained FPS as a
calculation unconstrained FPS is an
improved
prediction of how many frames would have
been delivered per second if the hmd did
not have a fixed update interval of 90
Hertz since they are fixed at 90 Hertz
really the most important item is
delivered at PS the unconstrained value
is calculated by taking $1000 seconds
and dividing it by the average frame
time which is done in the new FCAT VR
tool automatically the two hard metrics
are again delivered FPS which we can
validate with an effectively infallible
hardware capture setup and drop frames
also validated by hardware capture drop
frames are an absolute measure in total
frame count over the test period which
is 60 seconds at 90 Hertz a 60-second
pass will produce 5,400 refresh
intervals on the headset final note we
currently have a test variance of
roughly plus or minus 1.5% in this chart
for dirt rally we immediately see that
both the seventeen hundred and seventy
700k are capable delivering ninety FPS
to the headset that's what we want and
we next see that the drop frames have a
range of eight going from three to
eleven drop frames per test pass as we
saw in our previous charge the drop
frames are not clustered tightly enough
to be noticeable by the user in the
absolute worst case there are seven
1,700 encounters eleven drop frames over
it's 5,400 refresh intervals to put that
into perspective that yields a 0.2% drop
frames for the task period a user would
not notice this particularly when the
drop frames are spaced out over the
entire period we next see that
unconstrained FPS lands around 135 to
137 for the 7700 K while the are 770 100
is in the 105 to 115 FPS range again
this is an extrapolation we're still
seeing 90 on either device through the
HMD and let's now move to the average
frame time chart here we see where that
number is calculated this charts scale
is set to 12 milliseconds at which point
you'll probably start encountering that
drops wort misses or reprojection issues
the 7,700 case stock and overclocked
cpus perform effectively equally at
seven point three to seven point four
milliseconds the r7 1700 shows a bigger
gain from the overclock just outside
tolerances landing at eight point seven
milliseconds from nine point five four
milliseconds comparatively the 7700 K
stock experiences a 22 percent reduction
in average
over the 1700 stock and about a 14.8
percent reduction versus the overclocked
r7 1700 let's move on to next game
finally the next hosted game is elite
dangerous which has Hardware capture
footage on the screen now we're going to
simplify the frame time charts here and
only show comparative data if you want
all of the charts check the article
linked below elite has some issues with
the vive so we're using the rift this
was configured with VR high settings in
the game and played in the VR training
level this first chart shows the 1700
versus the 7700 K both had stock
frequency is the r7 1700 times to run
slower an average fan time delivery
sometimes running against the limit
before we start encountering the rift 11
to 13 most I can refresh interval again
note that oculus does some things and
run time to stretch that 11 mils I can
refresh out a little bit hence the extra
buffer at the end there as illustrated
in the interval plot at the bottom the
r7 1700 and the i7 7200 K are dropping
and sympathising a similar amount of
frames you can see that with the green
yellow and red colors on the lower two
charts neither of these is appreciably
worse than the other as a user again
this experience is equal within the
confines of human perception and with
what the heads of the Wow that said the
difference is statistically significant
you could make an argument that the
extra Headroom is valuable but we have
not yet found a scenario where we begin
encountering noticeable jarring or
stuttering on either the 1700 or the
7700 K this chart shows that
overclocking the r7 1700 it tends to
close the gap versus Intel which is also
now overclocked on the frame time and
interval plot graph that's the same as
we saw in dirt rally
it appears that over clocks don't
benefit Intel quite as much as they're
benefiting AMD here likely because of
the r7 s lower starting frequency we're
seeing a range of 6 for the drop frames
from 11 to 17 in the best and worst
cases and the i7 7700 KOC and 7700 K is
stock performed equally when looking at
the bar graphs that's within variance
and further illustrates that VR
benchmarking is not yet repeatable
enough to analyze with tight margins and
the hard statements as to what data were
seen even in the worst case of the 7
and drop frames we're still at 0.3% of
all frames delivered as drop whereas 11
drop frames would be 0.2 percent
completely imperceptible to the user the
dropped frames are also dispersed enough
to not matter with regards to actual
delivered frames we're at 90 FPS for all
four tests intel holds a lead in
unconstrained FPS as it has a shorter
frame Layton sees overall as shown in
the next chart that we're on now for
average at frame times R at roughly 8.6
milliseconds between the two Intel tests
and at nine point nine and ten point
four for the AMD test ten point four is
starting to push the limit of what we're
comfortable with but still delivers a
smooth experience in this game the
overclocked keeps us reasonably distance
from the 11 to 13 most I can mark and
again there's no perceptible difference
between the excuse given that they all
hit 90 FPS without any significant drop
frame counts that are noticeable on the
screen now our test passes for the next
game raw data we're moving on to the HTC
vive using raw data as a VR specific
title that's shown some promise this is
another king of the hill title as you
can see from the footage we've got on
the screen and these first results are
with the game configured to high
settings with zero mr-s this frame time
plot shows the 1700 versus the 7700 K
both stock neither CPU struggles here
with the 1700 generally being faster in
frame delivery that said both are below
the 6 millisecond line on average and
the interval plot below shows that Intel
encountered 0 drops or synthesized
frames and the encounters a few but
they're not significant enough to be
perceived by the wearer this seems to be
a trend between these two CPUs because
they're both pretty good at what they're
doing here these two for all intents and
purposes are again effectively
equivalent in this game here's the
overclocked data
same story here Intel drops no frames
but tends to run average frame times a
bit over the 1,700 let's just move
straight to the bar graphs delivered
frame rate post 90 FPS for all devices
with AMD dropping 6 frames in each pass
and Intel dropping 0 this is again not
really noticeable but it's worth
plotting because we can measure it Intel
CPU is again showing limited gains from
overclocking with both line items
performing effectively identically an
unconstrained
same rage and that's both 7700 KS the
same is true for AMD this time we're
overclocking doesn't really change the
fact that we're around 229 unconstrained
fps looking at average frame times we
see that the 1700 CPU stick around four
point three six milliseconds with Intel
around four point nine six milliseconds
looking back to the video capture of the
game which we can play on the screen we
think that both of these are so distant
from an eleven millisecond refresh
interval as to be effectively equivalent
in visual output you could buy either
CPU and experience an identical
experience in the headset for this raw
data pass we did on high based on our
initial testing more charts in the
article if you want to see the rest of
raw data data we're now testing it using
Arizona sunshine which is another kind
of the hill title on the vive and the
rift we're using the vibe here and
testing with advanced CPU features
enabled and very high texture quality as
you've seen oil introducing this game is
a zombie shooter game and this test is
conducted during the first swarm wave
here's the first chart both CPUs perform
at an equal framerate particularly when
considering the certainty of test
variants in this game there are seven
1,700 encounters more sins and drop
frames this time but we've still not
encountered a warp miss which is
important we have not seen a single warp
miss on any of these tests without any
warp misses between these drop frames or
without heavier drop frame saturation in
the interval plot it remains fair to say
that the experience between the two CPUs
is really not that much different
visually objectively Intel does have
fewer drop frames in this title
we're just basing a question of when
does that become noticeable to the
end-user and since VR testing is still
new it's kind of hard to say we need
more experience in the game to really
make a definitive statement on that
overclocking it helps the r7 1700 I've
seen here and post an effect of zero
change with a 7700 K again and then
finally let's move on to the next chart
here's the FPS output our seven 1700 ops
100 frames over 5400 intervals or 1.85
percent that's the most out of
everything we've seen so far but still
not a big deal and that's reflected in
the delivered frame bar as well where
we're seeing 87.5 FPS average versus
ninety FPS delivered frames to the
headset the overclock gets us down to 38
dropped frames but the gap between 57
fps and 262 FPS on our seven CPUs shows
that again this test is in
perfect this is precisely why we added
those error bars 87 verses 89 FPS is
also imperceptibly different and the
unconstrained framerate does not post a
statistically significant difference
either though objectively Intel is
better in this title at least with
regard to drop frames very quickly
here's the average frame time chart that
supports that statement again no
statistical significance in the
differences between frame times with
this test configuration they're
basically all the same
finally Everest is more of a tech demo
than the game that's the one we're
showing now it's got some high-quality
visuals that are stitched together with
photogrammetry lastly spoke to the
Everest ebbs the demo used more than
30,000 photos of the actual mountain to
build its environment we're using can
blue Icefall for the test course the
settings configured so that the bars are
2 ticks down dramatic settings and so
that they're all equal lengths in the
graphics menu which is really not a
great graphics menu here's the frame
time chart between the 1700 and 7700
Kate stock it's also the most boring
chart we've looked at thus far the
interval plot shows really no activity
other than mostly successful frame
deliveries frame times look about the
same looking at the FPS chart quickly we
see the same thing these numbers are
more or less equal average frame time
chart finally blasting through these
reinforces that everything is running
around 6 milliseconds to CP is producing
equal experience in this game with
neither superior to the other for the
most part there's no real significant
appreciable difference between these two
CPUs in these games and normally that
would be kind of a boring thing but
because VR testing is so new this data
is good to have because we can actually
start building an understanding as a
community as to what is a good
experience in VR and as we move toward
testing things like r5 and i-5 will
probably start seeing more drop frames
and limitations in VR with CPUs which of
course VR being such a high resolution
thing is almost natively a GPU
bottleneck but by controlling the
settings in the games and lowering them
down to things like high with a 1080i
hybrid we're able to eliminate a good
amount of that and still show some of
the CPU limitations it's just that the
r7 and the i7 do fine in this they don't
really have an issue in general for the
2 rift games we tested Intel tended to
do better but it was not in a way that
really
ultimately and the same was true when
Andy did better in the one or two games
where it posted superior frame times
whether that was a big or not Swain the
difference to a user was the same so
it's an interesting challenge to test
these things the heads-up Sarlacc 290
Hertz your frame rates lock 290 FPS and
unconstrained that metrics are really
interesting and cool to have be but it's
more for GPU testing where you might
have six GPS on the chart seeing on
constrained FPS in theory helps tell you
what the GPU is capable of in a more
familiar metric beyond the ninety FPS
limit which is effectively locked vsync
setting still it's an imperfect metric
because it's trying to extrapolate
something that you're not going to see
now unconstrained FPS does kind of tell
you hey this GPU or this CPU can prepare
more frames for delivery so in theory
going forward it might indicate that
that particular product performs better
but it's really too early to say if
that's how it's going to play out we'll
see
so overall first VR tests let us know
you think we have some more plans
probably for the r5 maybe the i-5 as
always you can go to patreon.com/scishow
