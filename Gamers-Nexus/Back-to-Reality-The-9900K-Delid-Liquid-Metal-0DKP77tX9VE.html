deleting the 99 hundred K and finding
its shortcomings we've been working on a
follow-up involving lapping the inside
of the IHS and applying liquid metal to
close the story on improvement potential
with the deal in process
we're also returning to bring everyone
back to reality on deleting the 99
hundred K because it's not quite as easy
as it may look from what you're seeing
online before that this video is brought
to you by the be quiet dark rock 4 and
dark rock pro for CPU coolers these
high-end coolers to focus on a smarter
approach to air cooling by adding a mini
fin stack on top of the direct contact
cold plate adding small bumps to the
fins for increased service area and by
using silent wanes 135 millimeter fans
custom-built for high performance
cooling without too much noise the pro
is a dual Tower cooler rated for 250
watt TDP while the dark rock 4 is built
for 200 watt TDP s learn more at the
link of the description below just a
quick reminder on this we already kind
of went over this process in our review
of the 9900 K but now we're adding on in
a bit so we've lapped the inside of the
IHS basically sanded it down
and we've added liquid metal and this is
something that we knew before launch
Rowan was working on as well and we
followed it up a bit after him so our
initial testing focused on thermal paste
high-end paste versus solder and you can
see those results in the previous in the
review or later on in this content but
now we're looking at liquid metal and
seeing how much further we can improve
it we'll also be talking about just is
it even worth deleting and kind of
addressed that already so the task of
lapping the inside of the IHS arose out
of necessity for this one it wasn't
because we necessarily wanted to the
truth of the matter is that no matter
what all of the tech reviewers including
us make it look like on camera it's
actually a higher level of difficulty to
do this deal it than all the previous
deal id's so there's something we tried
to touch on in the review because it's
easy to look at everyone deleting the
processors and think this is a good idea
I should do it but it's not quite that
you're seeing edited down versions of
what everyone's doing again including us
so it might take a couple hours whereas
on camera it looks like maybe 5 or 10
minutes
so it's worth talking about that and
making sure everyone's clear on if you
should actually do this or not
and the 9900 Kay to really get it
working well it's not exceedingly
difficult with addy lid but it is
definitely more work than popping the
CPU into addy litter turning a screw and
putting some liquid metal on it it's not
quite that easy
so for this job of course you'll need to
remove the silicon adhesive that's not
difficult then you'll also need to
carefully remove all the excess indium
solder from the die and the IHS
it is principally important that both
the surfaces are smooth when the deal is
done if it's not smooth and there are
chunks of indium still remaining the CPU
will almost instantly throttle and used
especially with liquid metal liquid
metal surface tension requires it to
have an opposing surface that is also
coated in liquid metal and depth
differentials could throw off the
contact and increase the likelihood of
air gaps between the liquid metal this
isn't like a paste or it'll just squish
out and fill in any of the gouges or
bumps and make up for mistakes although
we haven't tried it one could
theoretically use a liquid metal to help
dissolve some of the indium we know that
one is a gallon stand and the other ones
just indium but again we haven't tried
that we took the more barbaric approach
of a knife but this requires a lot of
patience slipping or getting too
aggressive will very likely result in a
dead CPU and it's the difficulties a bit
higher here as for internal lapping of
ice we have some footage of that process
as well there are better ways to do it
but it worked out decently so the way we
did this was we wanted to help deal with
gouges that were left over from indium
removal where I kind of use the knife
and scrape it up and you might end up
with a slight cut mark or slight
difference in depth between where the
indium was and where it wasn't of course
and so what we did we used grit 600
sandpaper then 1,200 and 2,000 then
2,000 wet and 3,000 3,000 wet ended up
with a very polished service so it
worked well there's more you can do of
course there always is with this stuff
but it was good enough there's good
enough to see an improvement and we'll
talk more about this process towards the
end but let's go over some of the new
results first and get those charts on
the screen so we're not going to reread
and re-explained everything from the
you can check the review the first
quarter of it if you want to see those
results initially so if you haven't
checked that you have questions about
testing or what-have-you then check that
content out as well when testing versus
a high end thermal grizzly cryo not
paste as we said in the review we found
that the differences didn't amount to
much Intel solder was only 4 to 5
degrees better than good paste on
average leaving plenty of room to
improve after our liquid metal
application we saw a temperature
reduction from about sixty four point
four degrees Celsius delta T over
ambient to about sixty degrees over
ambient that's an additional four degree
drop in our blender AVX workload it is
possible to get even bigger temperature
reductions of course but that might be
something we explore separately with
dice and E and this is where it's kind
of interesting the reason we didn't see
better performance here with liquid
metal or well we did but it's only four
degrees is because we have not yet
sanded down the die to be smoother the
IHS could be improved as well and so
there are some marks on the die or on
the surface of it from removing the
solder previously and those marks are
where you have issues with the surface
tension of liquid metal as opposed to
paste which can fill even fractions of a
millimeter of a dip where liquid metal
struggles and that's the point of this
content it's to illustrate how much
extra effort is required to really get
good performance
we spoke with their bearer separately
about his improvement and he spent an
entire week getting his dewitt dialed
surface smoothness is now the biggest
limiter to our performance results as a
reminder this is on our Kraken X 62
standardized test bench cooler not the
crazy setup we had for the stream a four
degree drop isn't bad considering
there's still so much more we could do
and it's what helped contribute to our
higher overclocks went on stream a few
days ago speaking of the stream let's
look at some of our overclocking results
our original overclock was confined to
5.2 gigahertz at about 1.3 five volts
after accounting for V droop as we began
running up against thermal limitations
with the solder and X 62 cooler
although the extra nine degrees will
help with overclocking on the X 62 we
switched to a 540 millimeter se radiator
from ek for our live stream we also
attached four of the Vardar furious
bands to it producing enough airflow to
create
hair flow as you can see in the
livestream footage and it was very loud
as well with all these things combined
we stopped our overclocked up to five
point three gigahertz stable or five
point four with pseudo stability and we
could definitely eventually achieve
stability with more work we also
increased the cash ratio to 50x
eventually later on and we still have a
lot more work to do on memory
configurations but we saw increases in
Cinebench and times by performance alike
I will post some of those numbers on the
screen now for Cinebench as reference
just changing memory increased the score
from about 2018 to about 2060 for
multi-threaded the point of showing that
is to just show the performance
difference from memory change as we used
a slightly different build for the live
stream here's our scaling chart with the
memory we measured 2153 CB marks when at
5.0 gigahertz all core a climb of 4.3
percent over the 2064 score going to 5.2
gigahertz all core pushed us to 22 65 CB
marks or another 5% climb over the
previous score and a climb of nine point
seven percent over the baseline 2064
marks at five point three gigahertz we
measured 22 92 cv marks and we're now
hitting diminishing returns about a 1.1
percent improvement for the extra 100
megahertz all court Cinebench did not
finish at five point four gigahertz with
this set up but times five physics did
complete four times by we measured
eleven thousand eight thirty three marks
at 5.0 all core twelve thousand 21 at
five point one or a 1.6 percent increase
then twelve thousand one 47 at five
point two another one percent climb and
then twelve thousand four hundred
nineteen at five point three and in at
twelve thousand five twenty one at five
point four gigahertz we measured a score
of twelve thousand six thirty five at
five point three with a 50 X cash ratio
and four thousand megahertz ram but this
is not comparable to the previous
results this is where we bring it back
to reality then deleting has never been
a hard requirement with intel's
processors never so it's easy to get
that confused out of the box it works it
does okay it's never really been
commendable thermally but it's fine
there's a reason they can sell it like
that and not get left out of the market
it has become a serious requirement for
actual real overclocking efforts as
we've Illustrated 20 degree reductions
on a 79 ad XE 18 core part our
very easily done with a deal it in
liquid metal so absolutely it helps this
can help outside of overclocking as well
like if you want to just drive down your
noise levels by reducing your fan speed
because the processor doesn't run as hot
anymore so there are there have been
good uses for d-lighting outside of the
livestream type stuff we do where its
competitive overclocking kind of exits
practicality with the 9900 K though that
benefit of the the practical benefits
start to fade and you start to look more
at primarily competitive overclocking
benefits which are realistically very
impractical for most users so with the
soldered CPU it's still not a
requirement to deal with it the solder
is absolutely better than the original
Dow Corning thermal paste I didn't tell
you so we give them credit for that
improvement Intel started this one out
of necessity the company could not have
achieved the clocks that it did with
thermal paste at least not as easily and
not across all eight cores not without
some form of increased cooling
efficiency and that was through a better
interface so even still it's clearly
possible to improve performance you
could go direct I to we've got to cut it
off somewhere though and as for whether
it's worth it to deal it realistically
the answer is no more so than previously
previously the answer has been maybe
just it's really not difficult you pop
it in 2d later you turn a screw you put
a new interface on it and you're done
not that hard but now and it's still not
that hard but now you remove the solder
too and there's a higher risk of Killian
or damaging the CPU there is more trial
and error testing involved where you
might think it's pretty good put it into
a system hopefully in test bench setup
not an actual computer and then maybe
it's overheating instantly which
sometimes happens with the previous deal
it attempts to but not nearly as often
so if you're going to deal it just be
aware that it might be a couple of hours
of trial and error if you're really an
experienced with this stuff and you
haven't done it before and it might be
maybe an extra thirty minutes to an hour
if you have done this before
because there is still going to be more
testing involved generally the answer
though is no it's not worth the elating
Upton extreme scenarios were you doing
competitive overclocking something like
that because an extra couple degrees
nine even 15 as de Barras on some of his
tests degrees off of the top yeah it can
help with reducing noise it can help
with other things like overclocking but
it's a lot more work involved and so
it's harder to recommend that route so
games require more attempts to get it
right there's more trial and error
testing if you start grinding down the
die lapping the IHS it's more likely
you'll see worthwhile improvements and
it's just it's not like the 798 exe
where you instantly see 20 degree drops
across all cores with less than an hour
of work involved so we'd only recommend
deleting at this point for people who
are pushing high clocks who are
competitively overclocking or who are so
neurotic about noise that a 100 200 rpm
reduction in fan speed will make your
day and there's nothing wrong with that
but that's kind of where we see it being
worth d-lighting at this point anyway
those are the results with liquid metal
we know it's possible to do better and
we know you can lap the die or send it
down I know you can grind down the
iatest some more but this I think is a
pretty good representation of something
that most people could accomplish in
less than an afternoon a couple hours of
work anything more than that you start
questioning the the time being worth it
or not more so than it is he questioned
here so that's it for this one as always
subscribe for more thanks for watching
check out our our initial review for the
foliar coverage of thermals and Romans
video of course is still worth checking
out if you want to see his more extreme
approach where he grinded down the die
