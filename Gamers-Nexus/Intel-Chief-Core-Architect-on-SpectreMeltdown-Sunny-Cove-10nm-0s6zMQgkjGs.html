joined by it's the chief core architect
Roenick single and we're gonna be
talking about a couple of topics say one
of the most important is the new sunny
Cove CPUs and just to give you some
background Roenick here worked on halen
previously so you led the performance
focus of that yep and he's been working
with Intel for a while now 22 years 22
years and the Hale um I think is
probably close to a lot of you so anyone
who who got their start with Nehalem
like I did with overclocking this is the
interview you'll want to see before that
this video is brought to you by thermal
grizzly and their high end thermal
compounds thermal grizzly makes cryo not
paced for high thermal performance and
conductivity without being electrically
conductive so you don't have to worry
about shorting components cryo knot is
particularly good for replacing stock
GPU pastes as cryo knot is a non curing
compound
learn more at the link in the
description below so let's start with a
really top level thing here because no
one at this point knows what sunny Cove
is outside of this event so what what is
sunny Cove meant will drill into it yeah
thanks to you know sunny Cove is our
next new microarchitecture so we've had
the long line of products that we've
built on the sky like microarchitecture
at sky lake a B Lake and coffee Lake
what we talked about today for the first
time was detailing what we're gonna
build on our next new microarchitecture
like you said codenamed sunny Cove it's
gonna go into a wide range of products
standard PCs laptops desktops all the
way to hours eons on the datacenter side
and so what we talked about today is
what are the big steps that we're taking
with sunny Cove in terms of general
purpose performance make the Machine
more powerful as well as new
instructions and new capabilities that
we're adding to the processor itself to
enhance algorithms like machine learning
or cryptography right there's been a lot
of advancement on the graphics front to
you which is perhaps a different topic
but some of the big ones you were
talking on in your presentation so you
had spectrum meltdown mitigations in
hardware now we were talking about 14
nanometer improvements and how that's
actually it gets brushed off a lot
we've brushed it off because you see
plus plus plus plus plus it loses the
magic of it but to intel's credit 14
animator has had significant performance
uplift right forget know and that's a
great point so you know with
Kove the first products with sunny Cove
will be on 10 nanometer but in the
meantime we do continue to advance what
we can do on 14 nanometer both through
what we do on the design and
architecture side as well as on the
manufacturing side so we've increased
the frequency you know from the first
skylights from you know 4.2 ish
gigahertz now we're up to 5km oh yeah
you know with some of the products on
the data center side we're enhancing the
architecture with new instructions for
machine learning for both inference and
training that will give us a really nice
speed-up as well there so what it what
is your biggest challenge when you're
talking about before we even get into
sunny Cove in in any detail what's your
biggest challenge when you're trying to
work with 14 animator and continue to
push it yeah there's a thermal envelope
is it what's going on yeah you know it's
actually in some ways easier to work
with amateur process technology like 40
nanometer because you have a lot of
information about it you understand all
about it and what its nuances are so
really finding way to just continue to
push the envelope on the performance
especially through frequency is
something we've been able to
successfully take advantage of over the
last year or so right
and then on sunny Koh so let's let's
touch on this one for you can't talk
frequency today right so just get that
out of the way right now
can't talk overclocking today what can
we talk i we can talk about a yes start
you know where we'd start today is to
say you know what is this is the base
foundation the microarchitecture for the
products that will come later on right
and like I said those products you'll
see desktop products you'll see PC
products and so forth but the base
capabilities does give us the
fundamental throughput advantages to
give you higher performance in addition
to wherever the frequency ends up with
these products so how do I increase the
smartness of the machine building new
algorithms how do I increase the number
of operations I can do every clock right
just that helps any of the applications
that are out there whether it's games or
multimedia applications or you know name
your favorite application really so our
focus is speed those all on with with
IPC what do you look at to improve IPC
at this point yeah you know direct you
to ways to answer that first of all when
we're doing our analysis what kind of
workloads do I look at to say how do you
know how do I tell if I'm actually
increasing performance so we look at a
lot of games we look at a lot of
multimedia applications we'll look at a
lot of things all
on the server side of things because
we're building a core to span that wide
range and we want to choose advancements
that help everybody across that but
there will be things that are more
specific to say a laptop part or a
desktop right right that we do what are
the kinds of things we do we do things
like expanding the ability to find more
instructions operate internal we do
things like making our caches bigger one
of the things we talked about today is
we're increasing the first level data
cache size by 50 percent yeah yeah that
was a big one so what let me let me
interject here for for people watching
what if they leave a comment say well
why didn't you do that before yeah and
you know the first level data cache is
one of the most fundamental pieces of
your microarchitecture and it's always a
really tricky balance between capacity
and latency and bandwidth right and so
we've really been focused on trying to
maintain the latency as much as possible
and really expanding the bandwidth over
the last few generations and if you go
back to what we were doing you mentioned
a handle me use that as a reference
point I could do one load one store at a
time and there were 16 bytes wide now I
can do today in skylake two loads one
store and I can do them up to 64 bytes
wide what we talked about today is now
we're doing two loads and two stores and
we're increasing the capacity and we're
maintaining the latency so it's really
how do you balance those three vectors
of latency capacity and bandwidth right
that makes sense
speaking of balancing things with these
security mitigations in hardware suspect
or meltdown big topic last year so now
where do you how do you deal with with
spectrum meltdown getting thrown into
the mix of things I would imagine the
the threat there is you might lose some
performance in exchange for preventing
those attacks so how do you write vent
them and so it's a great question I mean
Spectre in meltdown was you know
something that over the past year has
been a lot of focus and attention from
us both for our existing products as
well as for our future products so you
know we now have products shipping today
that have Hardware mitigations for some
of the cases like the Spector v3 or
sorry they're all done right you know
and that's what happens in whisky Lake
we'll have coming soon on the data
center side and later on on the client
side mitigations for what was called
Spectre v2 the branch target injection
case all of these are things where we
now
have a chance to harden the
microarchitecture put in hooks in the
heart and the microarchitecture and like
you said provide the protection while
bringing back the performance so what
how how long did you personally have to
work on tackling this product problem I
think they the researchers exposed it to
Intel AMD all the other affected parties
at least six months ahead of public
announcement right that's exactly right
so you know I was working on that
starting late last summer basically I
mean even when I took my summer vacation
last year while on summer vacation every
day was violent that's a great thing
that you know it was something that it
was that important to us and it was
something we had to invest in and we we
understood that you know the landscape
had changed in some ways because these
were new vulnerabilities that had these
researchers did a really good job in
identifying right so working with them
working with others in the ecosystem
that's one of the really good things
that's come out of this is working with
all of our software partners to
understand what can be done across the
ecosystem and then let's see so for
sunny Cove you had your three topics
there are security at the beginning you
talked about right deeper you talked
about a wider yep a smarter smarter
right so we went through a little bit of
those already but when you're talking
about wider what are you looking at for
sunny wider you know part of it is I can
I now have more functional units you
know we already talked about for
instance I can now do two loads and two
stores right at a time we also
introduced for instance on the vector
side the ability for certain operations
where we can do one per cycle now we can
do two per cycle in some cases so if
those are the kinds of examples of
making things wider just finding
opportunities to do more work at the
same time does this increase the package
size in a meaningful way or do you just
cram more into the same well so remember
that the first products with sunny Cove
will be on ten nanometer so we get the
advantage of the shrink factor by moving
to the new process technology so again
the overall package size will be a
function of the product in terms of
number of cores and so forth so right
we'll have more of those details right
let me throw two here that are kind of
general for you so let's
let's talk about a AVX a little bit I
came up briefly today first question for
you this is not specific to sunny coat
but just Intel in general and and
talking thermals okay so for a BX
everyone pretty much knows prime blender
as a real world example they really burn
the CPU why is a VX so much hotter than
any other application okay yeah and so a
VX is simply processing in general is
interesting right if you're able to get
take good advantage of these
instructions it's actually very energy
efficient because there's less
instructions going through the machine
to do the same amount of work however at
any given point in time instead of doing
two multiplies or four multiplies I'm
doing more of them at the same time so
at any given point in time you actually
are doing more work in the processor and
more work takes more power right right
so there are cases like you're saying
where you will see power go up as a
result of a V hmm yeah and we saw as a
recent example we retested the 2600 K
Sandy Bridge and the performance
difference there in blender versus
modern CPUs was nonlinear compared to
for example a 7700 k7r k99 RK which part
of that is of course cores than part of
it I think is the AVX capabilities yeah
so there's there's a significant
performance benefit you know and that's
one of the things we always tell people
is as we add new capabilities and new
instructions there's a lot of
opportunity for performance that people
are tuning their software right in AV X
is a great example of that right right
and anything you want to plug here for
sunny Cove at the end I mean that's
what's really interesting you well to me
you know each of these projects that we
work on whether it's an inhale amor a
Sandy Bridge or a sky like it's a long
journey and to get to the point where it
you know we're about to get it into you
know your your customers hand right you
know is an exciting time just to see
what people think of it right because
we're very excited about all the work
were poured into it how long does this
process take it's you know it's a it's
longer than you know then building a
cake or building a bed years right yeah
it's even just taping out yeah well it's
um it's a several year development cycle
on these that's
right well for more information check
the description below we'll have a link
to one of our articles or something like
that and thank you for joining me thank
you we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
