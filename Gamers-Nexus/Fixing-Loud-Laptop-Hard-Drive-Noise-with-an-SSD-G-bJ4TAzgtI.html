Christmas PC build I was able to get
another gift into the production queue
last minute and that was converting a
laptop from an internal hard drive at
7200 rpm to a solid-state drive and this
is because I hate to see computers that
function perfectly fine kind of be
thrown out or used less or whatever just
because one component that's replaceable
is failing so we're gonna talk about how
that fix a lot of problems including
noise in this video before getting to
that this content is brought to you by
AMD and the rx 480 and 470 GPUs which
are on the table and you can find links
to sales for those in the description
below but if you're not using something
like a DGP you to build an actual
desktop computer you might be using a
laptop and this is where we've done a
few videos recently one of them was
working on G ends Andrews laptop where
it had some pretty severe dust problems
if you recall we were able to improve
the thermals by I don't even remember it
was like almost 30 C in some cases but
it was a big improvement and that
improved our frequency and it removed
some bottlenecks in the system that were
caused by thermals overall fix a lot of
problems like freezing as well so that's
an instance where a laptop that works
well the silicon was all fine is being
killed by something that is resolved
well through some effort in this case it
was even easier because I didn't even
have to pull the whole thing apart and
clean it but I did a bit of cleaning
cleaned out the fan and the reason I
started there was because when you have
a laptop that's making a lot of noise
you generally think well it's probably
the fan so we went through the process
of pulling it apart looking at the fan
what's going on and it looked clean so
the next process is well maybe it needs
to be real Oubre kated or needs
something to freshen itself up replace
the fan maybe it's just bad bearings
none of those seem to be the problem
and after some heuristic checking of
putting my ear against the shell we were
able to figure out that it was the hard
drive the hard drive was spinning up to
such a high rpm basically it smacked
7200 rpm at all times including from
desktop that it was working
unnecessarily hard it was producing a
bit of extra
which of course increases the fan speed
a little bit too and just generally was
obviously on the way out so this is not
a drive that was long for this world
it's been put away in permanent storage
in a Faraday cage but other than that
the obvious next step was replacing it
so for a laptop it makes sense to do an
SSD upgrade or side grade depending what
you have in there now and that's because
of a few reasons some that you don't
think of on desktops normally of course
everyone thinks of speed as the biggest
improvement but not only that you get
some power savings so an SSD some of
them draw less than a watt of power
depending on if you're using s 0 X or
other advanced sleep and C States SSD
power savings and Windows 10 for
instance or even I think Windows 8.1 had
it but if you're using stuff like that
you get power savings and the drive is
not a physical spinning component less
risk of damage by just throwing the
laptop around in bags and it's quieter
and that noise in a laptop is a lot more
noticeable than in a desktop with other
fans and system components so that's
what we were working on the first step
was to clone the drive you can do that
by using software like Clonezilla and
you can also use a Cronus and you can
which is paid software you can use
Norton Ghost which is one of the
solutions that I used to use and liked a
lot over network he can do pixie boots
to ghost and then just clone into
everything from the network somewhere so
that's really cool and there's a couple
other free options to clone Zell is one
of the better ones but it does have some
issues so I know P you Xena Cronus went
through it's a I think a $30 Buy these
days went through an upgraded it did the
clone no problems whatsoever Windows
survived
I left BIOS setup as legacy is trying to
go to UEFI after you've already
installed it is not ideal set up as H
ahci
so everything was good no real issues
there there was one blue screen issue at
the very beginning and that was resolved
by going through and doing a check disk
so sometimes well pretty much every time
I've ever done a clone for a functional
in use real system as opposed to a test
bench you'll want to do a check disk
just to make sure everything is where it
should be so that fix that problem in
terms of improvements for this I grabbed
the UV for
drive Kingston Drive it was on sale 240
gigabyte SSD to replace something like a
480 maybe gigabyte hard drive something
like that and the drive was barely being
used so that was a fine option and we
did see gains in a few areas one of them
was reducing the boot time so that went
down from a little over a minute to
about 27 seconds as a much quicker boot
up of course and applications feel snap
here in addition to that change but we
can't really measure that easily and
that's a clear benefit on the
experiential and usability side of
things where things just kind of open
faster and it feels better but you can't
necessarily measure or quantify the
difference as for the rest the noise
levels for the original system put us at
about forty 9.1 DBA went under prolonged
idle periods without any load whatsoever
and that's almost entirely disk noise
with some fan noise thrown in because
things were heating up unnecessarily
with the SSD we're down to thirty 4.3
DBA and that's idle with a 36.3 DBA
average heavy loads that's when the
systems really working about as hard as
it'll ever work which is for things like
Excel spreadsheets PC mark benchmarks
things like that and then in a burst and
worst case scenario that should really
never occur we hit forty 3.4 DBA when
the fans were really ramping up for
short periods of time to deal with the
heat and that is not something we'll
really encounter but if we did it's
still lower than the idle noise with the
original hard drive and the louder fans
pre-cleaning and things like that so
that's really all there is to this video
the whole point is that if you've got an
old laptop because we just did another
one of these with dust it's really worth
pulling it apart and trying to fix
things piece by piece if possible if
there's not a silicon level failure with
the CPU or the GPU then normally the
fixes are trivial it's cleaning out dust
I just say trivial with air quotes
because it's trivial once you get to the
part that's a problem it might be
difficult to get there there are service
manuals you can look up online for
pretty much any laptop type in the name
of the laptop and the word service
manual and that'll tell you exactly how
to disassemble it that's the hardest
part once you're in there pull out all
the dust maybe remove the bearings and
the fans if it seems like it's necessary
it's been spinning against dust for a
while
tends to get hot and then drives of
course hard drives are pretty common
failure points and laptops primarily
because they move around a lot and
that's not good for a spinning disk so
you can get an SSD throw that in there
of course that's not news to anyone but
if the point of of prevention from doing
something like that was that you didn't
want to migrate your OS we didn't know
how the answer is very easy you can
install clones L to a USB key plug it
into a functional system ideally not the
unit you're working on there are some
pretty severe issues with a Cronus and
with Clonezilla when trying to work from
the local machine so if you have an
internal laptop drive and you have an
external drive plugged in to a USB 3
donegal or even you move it internal and
you try to boot to a USB key with
Clonezilla or a Cronus I've very rarely
had success with that
it's just something with the way the
laptops are set up it does not like but
if you plug it into a functional desktop
really no problems whatsoever you don't
even have to leave the booted
environment you'll have to go into a
special USB key environment or save mode
or anything like that it works perfectly
fine from the desktop with the
application installed so Cronus is an
option if you want a paid solution it's
a bit easier to walk through but
Clonezilla is not hard it's just it
looks more intimidating because it's got
menus that are arrowed to access all
Linux distro basically that's been
stripped down and changed into just a
very simple disk cloning and semi
partition management software parted
magic is also pretty good to look into
so I think hopefully that gives everyone
a basic idea of how you can make these
changes if you wanted to
pretty simple content overall but I was
I was very interested to see a noise
reduction from almost 50 DB to something
like 43 that's pretty substantial and 36
when it's under a more a nominal load
it's something like working with YouTube
we're at 36 DBA so that's pretty damn
good and it was exciting to work on and
as part of why I like working on
computers because you can measure the
results and see them in real time what
it does work you can watch our last
minute Christmas build 1 &amp;amp; 2 if you want
to see some of the process but doing
that troubleshooting live and
