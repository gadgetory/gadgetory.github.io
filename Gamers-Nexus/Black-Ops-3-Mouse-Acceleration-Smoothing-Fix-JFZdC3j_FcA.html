dotnet and this is just a quick note
about how to resolve some of the mouse
smoothing and acceleration experienced
in call of duty black ops 3 which just
released and you may have noticed this
if you're already playing the game but
basically and this is especially
noticeable in the menu systems there is
a slight amount of lag or spurious
motion or undesirable input from the
mouse when using certain settings in the
game so the main thing to look at first
of all is to just go to the controls
menu because there is actually a
checkbox that very simply says frame
smoothing so you just go disable that
first thing first and then go to Mouse
acceleration and mouse filtering make
sure those are zero if you are sort of
of the purebred to Counter Strike style
input player where you want almost no
modification or zero modification of
your input and then the biggest thing to
note with black ops 3 is that to a
greater degree than some other games the
mouse input will be very heavily
impacted by FPS so this is what we
talked about in our benchmark of black
ops 3 if your FPS is ever below 60 there
will actually be even in the 50s a
pretty noticeable hit to the consistency
of the mousing speed and in this way it
is worth dialing down settings even if
you're at 50 just to try and hit a
constant 60 FPS or better and
consistency is important so the max
frames per second counter is there
actually for a functional purpose in
this case it is not a bad idea to cap
your frame rate if you can hit the
higher frame rates because your mouse
input will be more predictable but you
generally want to disable the sync every
frame option which is vsync so get rid
of that and then you can play with the
other options like pneumatics frames per
second and see what feels best to you as
a user but if you're exceeding 60 if
you're exceeding a hundred frames per
second you really should not be noticing
any mouse acceleration or smoothing at
all because we're certainly not
any of the video cards we've tested in
those scenarios the only time we've seen
it is when the control options are set
to enable the filtration and smoothing
and acceleration aspects of mouse input
so do keep that in mind if you are below
60fps just get it higher and that should
fix most of your problems almost
immediately and then whatever's left go
play with the sink every frame setting
and the mouse control settings and of
course the max frames per second one as
well you'll generally just play around
with capping it and uncapping and see if
you prefer one of those types of input
so those are the items to change in the
settings of black ops 3 if you are
unhappy with your current mouse input
