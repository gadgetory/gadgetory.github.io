new an Tek case it's designed with Razer
in partnership before we get into that
this coverage is brought to you by iy
power and their new element gaming a
case which has a large tempered glass
side window a tempered glass in the
front and LEDs in the front and bottom
so this is the antic cube case as
designed by Razer it is a mini ITX case
for the basics what we know based on
looking at it anyway there's a 120
radiator in the rear so it obviously
supports 120 in the rear I don't know if
it includes a fan or not but 120 is in
there now it looks like a 240 in the
front for the radiator front support top
there is actually another acrylic panel
up here and on the other side there's an
acrylic panels it's basically acrylic
all around the rear side is what you
would expect it's cable management
component mounting for the drives so
there are two SSD sleds for 2.5 inch
support the towards the back towards me
there's a 3.5 inch drive as well that's
mounted vertically with the cables down
I believe so 3.5 the back to 2.5 s in
the front power supplies in the bottom
it is covered partially by a PSU shroud
that shroud only really covers the top
of the supply and then inside you have
your normal access to cables as you
would see in something like an s3 4 th
440 or something like that also
coincidentally designed by Razer in some
cases so the shroud extends out here
you've got the Razer logo in black no
LED is there however there are LEDs on
the bottom from what I understand these
are included they are green LED is quite
clearly and that's really everything we
know about the case there's a couple
things like dust filters small stuff
like that so is your power supply dust
filter everything else is pretty
standard got your front I Oh
over here power button in the top and I
don't know sort of what the power supply
for impacted support is or the prices
right now if we find out link in the
description below for more information
on that
and I suppose really the only thing left
is video card support it will support up
to 350 millimeter lawn video cards as
indicated by this Titan Z up in the top
so that is the antic cubic ace as
designed by Razer links the description
below for more information page on like
the poster
helps out directly I'll see you all next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
