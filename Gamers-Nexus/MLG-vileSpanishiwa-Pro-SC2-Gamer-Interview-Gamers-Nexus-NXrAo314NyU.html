Nexus of Ned and here with vows Benicia
wa how are you doing today I'm doing
pretty well
I'm out of the tournament so far so it's
just pure spectating from here but I had
a good run you had a good run who beat
you
round one it was actually a team kill
with vile illusion it was one too so it
was pretty close CBT matchup and then I
made it pretty far in the loser's
bracket I got to like round eight or
nine and then I matched up with the
Muslim and it was really close I tied it
up 1-1 but then the last game got a
bunker rush off and I've never seen the
type that he did so it just kind of
killed me yeah I mean he's been first in
grandmasters how did you like your run I
mean you'd might like it have whether
your do you expect to go higher up or
maybe lose before I was actually kind of
expecting to beat the Muslim but I was
playing spades like a round or two
before which is also another zvt I ended
up beating spades - oh but the Muslim
was like right behind me the whole time
like he was seeing what I was doing you
know my my base timings and everything
so the first game he just like totally
smashed I mean it wasn't even close I'm
guessing there was a lot of metagame
yeah yeah I was trying to like do it
like a double meta game and then it's it
was just worried yeah way to inception
it it happens it happens
alright so who do you think is going to
win I think it's good not gonna be a
foreigner unfortunately but yeah so one
of the one of the Koreans it looks like
not as playing really strongly so if
he's in a position to take it then I
think he could hopefully here well I
mean it's gonna be his first sc2
tournament ever ever
yeah alright and did you like MLG rally
how do you like rally scheduling it was
kind of hectic just because of Hurricane
Irene and you know some of the players
weren't able to show up so a lot of
Flair's got byes fortunately I wasn't
lucky to get that I got a team kill
brown one but other than that it's been
it's been a lot of fun all right
and just as a closing note would you go
will you keep going to mo g RL to MLG
rallies to em oh jeez and will
you just will we see you again um it's
definitely part of the plan I don't know
if I'll make all of them like Providence
I think it like there's some qualifying
issues and then but the other
tournaments I should be should be
attending like Orlando all right men
thank you very much this is Francisco
