i'm happy i have to say no it's really
amazing to come out here and have event
like this talking about pc gaming is i
would say that 23 years ago I felt like
doing Padma Bhushan gaming now it seems
like everyone has up his game
nothing for me when it's helpful that
said hey we're going to introduce this
new chick with both alike excellent Oh
cause push let's push the power I think
everyone knows that my games in general
boys been trying to push what you can do
with the technology and that's the
coolest thing about pc world is it up
shops it's always every year there's a
new process there there's a new GPU or
is it you peripheral like this or
something that you can really create a
new experience for it so the fact that
like be a call from the hexa core is
very cool we're really trying to
increase the multi threading ability of
like in sauces and paste we're going to
try to have more visits Fred's for
rendering creds or animation friends or
nai friends and so having more cause
definitely help them ok we get a few
freak as well so yeah really quite happy
to have a company as big as it sells for
coming back and focusing back on pc
gaming answer because for me I think the
pc gaming is what drives a lot of the
technology like on the motherboard and
graphics group is basically a one out
there I think we pretty much is always
wanting to have like coolest fastest us
thing and so that's not necessarily what
a someone is doing word processing one
said they only the change in what they
have for the machine breaks down here
no I think I ready to people all the
time there was a spouse's in fact that I
was hanging out with biliary he said I
just got my new machine is got to
tighten disease in SLR and i hope i can
be running everything look okay i said
yeah i think so yeah i'm really happy
and excited to see that you focus on pc
gaming and the star citizen side i can
still make a promise that we'll always
be trying to use whatever the coolest
newest fastest thing to push the level
of the version and trafficking fidelity
what we can in the world i don't know
how many successes and backers here
let's make this game in a way that don't
have to compromising you don't have a
publisher we all have investors we just
have you guys want the best possible
game do you want to make the best
possible game so that's what's
appreciated I don't also say other than
i was showing the game which actually
have an early version of the release
feed 0.9 of the logitech move so if
you're on the show for you go by logic
babe I think we're also showing at the
only one
screen that I've told is pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
