to set out there and really try to get
ripped off outside of maybe pain a TNT
or spectrum for Internet we still tried
though we bought this GTX 1051 gigabyte
card that was listed on eBay at least
that's what it was called the card was
$80 and was advertised as a new GT x
1050 with one gigabyte of video memory
and it even came with a questionable
definitely not malware CD in an
unbranded brown box opening up gpu-z it
even thinks that this is a gtx 1050 and
knows that it has one gigabyte of ram so
everything looks right today well
benchmark the card and explain how this
scam works and how they're able to trick
software like gpu-z before that this
video is brought to you by thermal
grizzlies high-end thermal paste and
liquid metal thermal grizzlies cryo knot
is an affordable high quality thermal
compound that doesn't face some of the
aging limitations of other pastes on the
market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted test bio tube at the link in
the description below so we'll keep this
fairly short part of what we're gonna do
today is pull off the cooler here and
see what GPU is actually underneath
because as you'll see it's on the
performance results it doesn't line up
with 1050 performance and we'll cut a
few of the charts out or really shorten
them just because it kind of you get the
point across after three or four of them
really also testing methodology no I did
not install the drivers from this
unlabeled dvd-r with butterflies on it
because I'm not sure what's on here and
I don't want it on my network whatever
it is so we got the driver straight from
Nvidia they worked just fine pulling the
latest version the card I'll note is not
Nvidia's doing so just because they made
the GT 1030 ddr4 card which is like the
worst we've looked at in the last year
don't be mad at Nvidia for this one they
deserved the anger for the 1030 ddr4
card but this one is something you'll
find basically on Alex
whereas an eBay so it is not a
sanctioned product at least not as its
advertised though it was at one point
and a video product and we'll see what
that was as we get towards the end of
the content so other than that I think
we can just constrain to the testing as
always if you want to know what platform
we use for testing check the article
linked in the description below for
testing methodology otherwise we'll go
through a couple of charts and take the
cooler off and see what it is let's
start with Ghost Recon wildlands at
1080p with medium settings just because
we already had some data on the 1050 and
rx 560 cards the card instantly maxes
out its fear on capacity and ends up
overall worst in performance the ebay
GTX 1050 1 gigabyte card operates an
average frame rate of 21 FPS with the gz
x 1050 properly at 47 FPS average note
that the 1050 is from msi and is named
1050 OC but it's not actually
overclocked they just called it that
regardless we're at over a 2x difference
between the two here's a quick frame
time plot that shows the chaotic
performance of the GTX 1050 one gigabyte
scam card remember with frame x we're
looking at frame to frame latency on
delivery so the important part is a
consistently low frame delivery interval
having the line jump up and down and all
over the place is bad and indicates
stuttery performance and also having a
higher overall line indicates a lower
frame rate 16 milliseconds would be 60
fps reverence this 1050 might actually
be worse than the GT 1030 ddr4 card that
we recently talked about ok maybe it's
not that bad this is dota 2 the GT 1030
ddr4 manages to hold its crown as the
worst card tested this year a true
accolade the GTX 1051 gigabytes cam card
manages 61 FPS average which is still
impressively worse than the GT 1030
gddr5 card 67 FPS average and is outside
of margin of error csgo shows similar
results with the GT 1030 gddr5 card
outperforming the GTX 71 gigabyte card
by 10% the new 1050 that we bought isn't
looking so good the Raven Ridge rr5 2400
G performs within arm's reach
even when overclocked to 1600 megahertz
on the IGP and this is without looking
at any real 1050 it's just the scam one
we bought so it can't even match up
really with a 1030 gddr5
Sniper Elite 4 is the last before we
pause the charge to see what's going on
under the hood before even showing the
chart take a look at this gameplay clip
of Sniper Elite Sniper Elite is dumping
the texture quality with some meshes
coming back near the texture list and
that's a result of the one gigabyte
memory capacity the card can't even keep
up enough to render the full texture
quality even still here's a chart we're
seeing 22 FPS average for the gtx 1050 1
gigabyte with the EVGA GTA 4 mean and
alleged gtx 950 1 gigabyte overall the
question remains then what's really
under the hood on this thing so now it's
time to take the cooler off and see
what's really in there because it's not
a gtx 950 it is maybe Pascal but it's
performing worse than a GT 1030 in some
cases so we'll see all that came with
the product was this brown box and this
DVD that's it and then the video card
itself if you call it a video card at
this point so there's the video card
this thing is an older design from
previous generation the single fan axial
cooler with a extremely thin aluminum
heatsink so this is an aluminum heatsink
that is not too different from some of
the 1050 cards on the market but either
way it's not a good one only four screws
holding this thing together should be
pretty quick you can see here by the way
it says gtx 1050 1 gigabyte gddr5 uh 54
100 megahertz and it claims a core of
928 megahertz also it's got HDMI and VGA
on it which if you've had a Pascal card
or have looked at Pascal VGA is
extremely uncommon though we will allow
that maybe in the Asian market it might
be more common so maybe that's a
difference there but they say it's a
1050 so let's see if it really is don't
paste alright so there's our cards
cooler is very unimpressive ok so time
to see what it is first of all this is
not a Pascal package if you've seen our
Pascal tear downs in the past they don't
look like this anymore they
orient them this way the whole spacing
is incorrect for a 1050 so it's probably
not one of those okay so it's all
cleaned now let's see this thing is GK
106 220 - a you might be asking what the
hell is a GK 106 I haven't heard of that
Pascal GPU that's because K it stands
for Kepler which is an architecture that
while the G K 106 specifically was the
650 TI
so if you remember that this GP or if
you remember the 650 Ti that's what this
is G K 106 is a 650 Ti and that card
came out and end of 2012 October 2012 is
when this GPU came out it is now almost
six years old and you can see also how
old this is because it's got Alpina
memory on it these memory modules first
of all there are four of them despite
being one gigabyte which tells us the
density of the modules but also there
al-qaeda al-qaeda was bought in 2013 by
micron they don't even really exist
anymore they've been acquired
so Alpina memory no longer exists and
that should really just show how old
this is so it's it's been secretly
rebranded as a 1050 remember this was an
Nvidia product at one point this thing
but this card as a whole branded as a
1050 certainly is not an Nvidia product
and the other sad thing here is that
even the the process is different so
Pascal is 16 nanometers and this thing
was 28 I think for Kepler very different
architectures Kepler came after Fermi
and before Maxwell and then Pascal was
after Maxwell so Pascal is is
significantly newer this is no gtx 950
it's a 650 di at the end of the day is
what we've learned here so the 650 TI
was fine at one point but how did they
do it I guess is the question it shows
up as a 1050 in GP
and another software and it does show up
with the correct amount of memory it is
1 gigabyte after all but the 10:50
labeling comes from just a BIOS so it's
a BIOS mod and all they did was renamed
the card in that bios mod it's actually
not that difficult to do
particularly on Kepler where it was
easier to do hacks on the video cards
that have been largely locked down on
Pascal's it's a lot harder to get away
with this kind of stuff now it's
unlikely that you'll see the same kind
of trick with the same level of success
in a couple of years when actual ten
fifties are branded as say 11 or 12
fifties or whatever so probably won't
see quite as much of it I'm sure they'll
still be scams but basically they just
changed the name of it in BIOS and then
flashed it onto the card and that's how
it's done so performance is a 650 T I
will put some extra charts on the screen
we did ashes we did fire strike and time
spy did a couple of other games as well
and it's just it's not worth talking
through them because I guess I guess
there's one benefit here if you've been
wondering how a 650 Ti performs we've
accidentally benchmarked it so now you
have numbers for that it's just labeled
as EBA 1050 one gigabyte so that's it
for this one don't buy the card it's 80
bucks on ebay do not buy it it is a scam
there are plenty of other ones on there
you can normally tell them apart because
the price is too good to be true if
that's the case it probably is too good
to be true especially cuz this was
branded as new it's not like it was a
used device in which case it would be
harder to detect the scam and also you
can kind of tell because there's
probably no branding on the card at all
and they probably don't list it as like
a sues gigabyte EVGA anything like that
it's probably just listed as gtx 1050 or
whatever so that's it pretty interesting
scam I guess that's the new one as
