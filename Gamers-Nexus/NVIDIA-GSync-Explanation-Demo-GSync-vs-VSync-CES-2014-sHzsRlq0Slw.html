Nexus Donna and we are here on the floor
at CES 2014 so this is our first
official day on the floor you saw some
of our msi footage now we're here with
him nvidia to look at g-sync
and i am joined by Vijay Sharma working
on g-sync Vijay what can you tell us
about how how jisuk works from a top
level and maybe give us some technical
details
great yeah jisuk is a new technology
that delivers the smoothest tear free
gaming possible are really excited about
it and we've got partner monitors on
display here today at CES which will be
available in q2
so how g-sync works let's start with how
traditional monitors work and in a
traditional monitor if we think about a
60 Hertz refresh monitor it is expecting
60 frames per second from the source or
the GPU
consistently and the GPUs however in
most modern games don't output at a
constant framerate frame rates vary so
if you think of a really simple scene a
GPU can render that very quickly but if
you have a complex scene the GPU might
take longer and so frame rates vary a
lot and when frame rates vary and the
monitors expecting a consistent frame
rate a few things happen with vsync on
you get stutter because the the monitor
re displays the previous frame and any
time that happens to get the stutter so
you can turn vsync off and if you turn
these sync off you get something else
you get tearing and you've probably as
you've played games experienced tearing
on the scene where you have these these
horizontal lines ripping through the
scene
what g-sync does is as soon as the GPU
is done rendering a frame it sends it to
the display and what that does is it
eliminates tearing eliminates display
related stutter and really importantly
for gamers it minimizes the input lag
versus vsync on so you get very fast
response time as you're as you're
playing a game
and so that's basically what g-sync does
is the monitor slaves off of the GPU the
GPU drives monitor timing and what's our
normal monitor time for a frame delivery
what it when is the monitor expecting a
frame from the GPU right so on a sixty
Hertz refresh rate display your the
monitors is expecting a frame every 16
milliseconds or so and on a 120 Hertz
monitor it's about every eight
milliseconds or so okay and in terms of
availability we know we have some of
these announced here at CES where should
our gamers be looking for g-sync enabled
devices sure so today on on display we
have six announced monitors from
partners such as a sous BenQ viewsonic
Philips and they will be available in q2
so really looking forward to that and
let's say I already have a monitor I'm
happy with any chance of a modular kit
anything you have for us yet we have
talked about a deal a do-it-yourself kit
and the kit is for one specific model of
a sous monitor it's a VG 2 for 8 QE and
what the kit is designed to do is modify
that monitor to be a g-sync monitor now
this is a kit for really core enthusiast
gamers that we built it so that we could
get g-sync into their hands as soon as
possible because like many gamers we
don't want to wait and so you can do
that do that now you should be familiar
with modding so it takes a bit of skill
and it you should be a real enthusiast
if you want to go do this it should be
available on our website by the end of
this week very cool so I think that
covers actually a lot of you guys check
out the links in the description below
for full article coverage and we'll have
some slides in there as well that show
more of how g-sync actually works in
terms of the frame delivery so you can
get a visual representation of that and
yeah thanks again we will see you all
next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
