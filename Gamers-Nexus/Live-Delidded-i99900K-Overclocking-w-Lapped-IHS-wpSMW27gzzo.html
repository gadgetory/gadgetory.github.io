we live now I think we're live now
I don't know YouTube's been telling me
all kinds of stuff for this so I let me
know if it's coming through okay I guess
YouTube has has given me mixed reporting
on if it's actually coming through
smoothly with the audio so let me know
if you can hear us and and see me and if
it's you know actually like moving
because that would be good
alright cool so it looks like everyone
everyone can see it so welcome to the
stream we're gonna be overclocking a
9,900 k today I'm looking forward to it
this should be a pretty fun one done
I've done quite a few mods since the
review and I just now seen me waving
delayed of it there so it looks like
it's smooth that's good
alright so I'll be talking about the CPU
momentarily I'm gonna let some people
join in first stuff like that and you
know this was a it's a pretty big launch
day for Intel and I haven't had a chance
Ivan had time to look through and see
what colleges online think I haven't had
time to see what what other reviewers
think so I expect to see some some chat
tonight what you think about the 99er K
because I need to get I need to get
caught up and of course the only way to
do that is to read chat apparently all
right so we've got a couple things to
talk about with a CPU I'm just waiting
for people to join in so I don't have to
say it too many times in a row and I'll
start going over the bench momentarily
once already with that so as people are
joining no not rip J today I'm sorry
what we will be doing is just a just
overclocking the CPU just then 9900 Kay
and I need to see how I forget how to
open up super chat from this new
interface I've been using for for
YouTube's live streams we're using the
events page now instead of the live
streams page it seems to be a bit more
reliable but also completely unnavigable
alright so yeah it looks like Chad's
pretty much in line with what I was
expecting
for haha for the the take on the 9900 K
okay so we should be good just to pretty
much start going through everything
duuude send out the tweet you know what
I should do that let's send out a tweet
to hide one we're live before we start
really going so we are live okay okay
told everyone at it I don't know why it
sweets in all caps a lot of exclamation
exclamation points from oh yeah all
right so yeah I'm redoing I don't know a
bit of a chat vote here let's you know
while people are joining in let's take
just kind of a quick tally so I'm gonna
be overclocking just the CPU today we're
not going to focus on the GPU really
what I want to know is someone says I
love that shirt thank you cellphone Dave
it's a new limited edition sure it's on
the store on store documents access net
if you want to pick it up we're figuring
out what sizes we need to order so we've
got a pre-order period to figure out
what size to bring in and then once
they're sold out will cut off the orders
and clit and and stop making them so
yeah benches so we have a few options
let me pitch like two or three of them
do you want to see how much do you want
to see Cinebench versus like times by
extreme or times by I guess CPU testing
that's what I want to know so times by
CPU test physics test Cinebench fire
strike physics test is another option
just type type one of those names in
chat I'm gonna take an ad hoc poll on
what it seems like people want to see
the modes you can type in I guess type
in 3d mark or Cinebench something like
that seen a bit of both right now
blender I couldn't do blender cuts sit
and watch it render it still image for
15 minutes this is exciting
Cinebench is definitely faster we do a
bit of both so we do some but we can
this do a bit of both looks like Sena
benches is pretty in demand time spine
center pitch it's like you equal so
we'll do it we'll do all right I got it
we'll do high we'll do a bit of both so
yeah welcome to the stream we are we
walk you through the parts and stuff I'm
going to tweet this out one more time or
post it on Facebook or something
and otherwise we're gonna walk through
this new CPU see how high we can
overclock I didn't try super hard for
the review I pushed the 5.2 gigahertz
without really any effort and just
stopped there and figured we do more
here today with a 540 millimeter
radiators I'll show you momentarily so
we are live with a 900
overclocked stream I guess okay alright
okay so let's uh let's get going here
chat has now updated me on what the
internet thinks about this new processor
so that's always helpful to know and at
this point we need to see how far we can
push the thing so allow oh there we go
open super chat a new window nice okay
cool we got two dollars from xes who
says you'll need an egg to cook on the
CPU yeah that's we probably get into
kind of that temperature sometimes so
let's go through this thing before I
turn it on it's off right now because as
you'll see momentarily there's a very
large radiator with a lot of fans on it
and uh here it is so this is the ek it's
one of the ek 540's they sent in for a
rip J stream which we'll get back to
after this spy in the next couple days
we'll visit that and maybe about a week
visit that again but ek7 this this was
one of ours either our GPU or our CPU
radiator was in the ice bucket and now
it's back with just fans you know I kind
of thought for this stream I want to do
something realistic that anybody could
build and that that seems like it might
be something you'd actually try an
overclock at home so I don't want to do
an ice bucket but then I used a 540
millimeter radiator so I guess I didn't
really stick to that plan z well this is
this kind of just miss I don't know it's
it's a bit misleading this is left over
I left it on there because we might end
up dunking this radiator in a future
stream and doing a chilled overclock on
the CPU but it will not be chilled below
ambient today we're just going to use
ambient air for cooling the radiator and
it has four Furious fans on it they're
called the Vardar Furious they're very
loud I can bring down the speeds later
if we need to but
we're gonna try and run at full speed
and hopefully it won't bother everyone
too much then for the loop it's actually
very simple this time so despite all the
stuff on the wood block the actual loop
is just this one so it's it's only this
pump and reservoir combo hooked up to
the Supremacy block I think which is
hooked up to the 540 it's a really
simple loop for this and what case does
that fit and I honestly am Not sure I'm
not sure what you know what case you had
fit it in deal it and conduct not yes
that's really important so ambient
temperature of the room is 22 right now
so yes it is delighted it's actually not
hard you can use the existing deal with
tools for for existing CPUs rates 8000
series 7000 series all that stuff and we
are yeah we'll do dry ice eventually yes
but I don't know about for this so it is
deleted and then the what else we got
going on I laughed the inside of the IHS
so I sanded it down and that took a long
time
so sanded that down last night and then
after that just kind of put liquid metal
on it I've got it working so so yeah
it's it's gonna be cooler than in our
review we're in the review I had just
Hydra not on there versus solder which
is a really interesting test but not
what we want to do for this so yeah
that's that's what we've got going on
you got two more super chats Joe Susan
in two dollars testing one two three
four five thank you very much
detune 32 dollars what I need to
reinstall windows 7700 Kate's in ninety
nine hundred K with Windows 10 you can
kind of get away with that I would
recommend to clean install for Best
Performance just to make sure there's
nothing sneaking the drivers left behind
I did not laugh to die so I did IHS
laughing and we didn't do the dot I know
Roman did that I talked to him about
that but we just did the IHS only so
okay let's turn this thing on when I
apologize
now for the noise and step back a bit I
don't know if we'll be able to show it
but those fans actually goes so fast
they push stuff around in the background
it is is they're very fast fans and
there are a lot of them what motherboard
are using we are using the Maximus 11 so
it is and we're gonna reset bios we're
using the Maximus 11 hero
it's an asus motherboard we've got the
we've got a half kit of g.skill Triton z
black on there it's the same memory that
we used for the rip J and repel TT stuff
but I only put two of them in there and
I have not I'm done like any overclock
on this so we're gonna be figuring this
out all alive and let's see other parts
RT X xx atti XE ultra but we're not
really going to using the GPU and then
an ax 1600 eye power supply which should
be set in single rail moment mode but
we'll find out if I trip any over over
current protections or anything like
that so let's start simple I'm gonna go
ahead and just reset straight defaults
with XMP and let's get our baseline with
this will do Cinebench and we'll do like
a time spy extreme or time spy physics
and see how that does how are you
working in the 79 80 FC is this Doctor
Who 867-5309 it's this is 1080 XE no but
thank you for the $2 a couple more Super
chats while this is booting we got a
Guido Sarducci $2 but does its crisis
probably almost definitely bazinga X $5
what do you think of enter max was
looking at there neo changer pump and
res combo I don't know anything about
that pump or reservoir or that series at
all aromatics has some some actually
surprisingly good products they have
some surprisingly very bad products like
any other company so it's I mean as a
whole I have no opinion of just straight
enter max
but they definitely have some stuff that
has has performed better than we
expected and then it found we found out
it was corroding so that was unfortunate
all right let's just launch Cinebench
and I've got like I've got stuff going
in the background secondly a perfect
score but let's just get a baseline
today you know we should blast the
brightness on this monitor and probably
wipe it off too
let me do that while we get this started
where are the buttons for this monitor
I hate navigating monitors brightness
nope Oh nope don't want that oh it's got
a navigational button it's nice okay
cool brightness 100 okay that's not what
I want that's that's good yes I'm gonna
wipe that down too but can you see it
okay and right now okay so we're gonna
wipe that down we know they don't use
this screen for streaming so it's
running Cinebench single-threaded just
for a baseline I'll get a hardware info
running in a second and we'll take some
some numbers for thermals and actually I
should use a different type of cleaner
than this and the good news about the
single-threaded test is it takes a long
time so I can walk around for a second
and clean this up so this will be
baseline all I've done is XMP and that's
pretty much it just XMP on the on the
memory which is 3600 megahertz to be
fair this is a riveting stream I guess
we don't need my test data notes anymore
since what those are all done now so
this is our live stream of cleaning a
monitor welcome we're actually venturing
into lifestyle videos now we've noticed
that those do way better get a wider
audience and gonna offer useful tips
like like the clean your monitor you can
use a paper towel I think that's pretty
new
all right better house is that like okay
on screen oh cool
okay so let me check out chat is this
the 9900 it is the 9900 kay and no
vacuum nope no vacuum we don't need a
vacuum to clean a monitor all right so I
did not break it yet it's just running
complete stock right now we're not going
to do many of these I'm only gonna do a
single core tasks like when we hit a
really stable clock so we're gonna take
a note of this when it's done and
that'll be our single core baseline and
then after that we can do multi-threaded
and a physics test so right now it's
complete stock with XMP on 3,600
megahertz for that this is going to be a
different kit of memory than we used for
our fart review so if you saw the review
we use the thirty two hundred megahertz
kit there and it looks like chat
spilling in pretty well so welcome to
everybody who's just joining them now
I'll walk you through the parts again in
a second since you missed probably a lot
of you missed the beginning but basics
here the 900k came out I from what I've
seen in chat it's pretty much expected
really expensive but high performance
just a question of is it worth it and
then we deleted ours did liquid metal on
it we talked about deleting it in our
review but didn't show the liquid metal
application and it actually worked out
pretty well so our baseline here 219 for
single so 219 1 T and that is with
complete stock I'm gonna take notes
stream notes 9900 KOC and we get to the
super chats in a minute also has a note
if you pick up the anything from the
store today especially these new foil
graph logo shirts these are going to be
limited edition shirts like and the last
one sold out within about two weeks I
think and we have like a couple left
over after that
but that was it so once once they're
gone we're not making any more they'll
be gone they've ate they were very
popular last time so I come the
this time as well but if you picked
something up on the store store deck
everything exits net I will be sure to
try and shout out as many as I can but
no promises due to the high volume I can
always get all of them so alright so two
19's are single core score let's do a
multi-threaded baseline no overclocking
just yet and see how that does how do
you clean off the solder great question
and I'll get some of the super chats in
a second - so that was just a normal
chat though so a great question how do
you clean off solder here's a knife so
yeah there's some footage of it in our
review but so to crack it open you can
use any D letter
just like with v8 the previous two
generations you can say use the same D
letters so you can use their Bauer's you
can use rocket cools if you want a
cheaper option that's what I used
and it'll just crack it open just like
they're all pay it's not advising you do
this mind you it's it's actually it's
good enough with solder that I'd really
recommend against the D letting unless
you absolutely need the last couple of
degrees for whatever competitive
overclocking you're doing so it would
not advise it but just for sake of
curiosity if you want to know how its
open do you put it in a D later you turn
the screw and it cracks it open and then
scrape off all the silicone adhesive
just like normally the Saudis are a
really soft solder so it's indium and
it's very soft you can scrape it off
even just with your fingernail but I
used a razor blade so I used a short
like box cutter razor blade that I cut
in half and that was able to get in
there and scrape most of it up and then
the problem is it's hard to get it to be
a properly smooth the surface and if you
slip with that razor blade when I was
talking with Roman dear Bauer we were
talking about this if you slipped with
that blade that CPU might be dead so
really have to be careful and it's it's
it's definitely not something I
necessarily recommend for almost anyone
but it was fun and also a huge pain
because to really get the IHS to where
it needs to be you kinda have to sand it
so I sanded it with a 600 grit 1200 mm
mm wet sand 3000 so it's really shiny on
the inside of the IHS and we can do a
bit more but anyway so our baseline
here 2064 for baseline that's within
reason I think we've seen like 2018 and
our some of our other validation runs so
just depending on this memories faster
so that makes sense so 2060 4nt complete
stock okay so are you going to file down
the dyno no I'm not I mean I might sand
off a little bit to smooth out the top
because it is kind of uneven right now
and that bothers me but I'm not really
planning on doing anything serious with
dyno Roman worked on that and I think
that's on his channel it's going to
check it out but we're just gonna
restart and do some actual overclock
stepping here probably just start with a
5 gigahertz all core it's pretty easy
it'll definitely hold there's really
take any effort and then we get a good
baseline for what happens when it's all
core or 5 gigahertz so that's something
that you can almost certainly achieve on
I would think all of these I would
certainly hope all of these
out-of-the-box with you 5.0 both core so
that'll be a good comparison then we can
do a 5 point one for some numbers there
5.2 I know is stable and 5.2 beyond
beyond that I'm not sure what happens so
we'll find that out together alright so
we have let's let's just start going
through the options here I'm gonna try
and read some super chats when I can so
AVX definitely zero offset for a BX sync
all cores we're gonna do a 50 X
multiplier or 5 gigahertz for now and
that'll be our starting all core you've
got a bit of glare up here and yep it's
that one cool and then so let's see what
else do I need to turn off here I need
turned some stuff on some stuff off we
need to disable SPID supports I'm gonna
turn that off I'm gonna go to not
touching the timings right now digit
plus power that's good
so load line calibration we're gonna set
to level seven that's pretty much a
straight line although on this CPU we do
have some V group even at level eight
LLC so I'm gonna have to increase the
voltage input more than what I actually
want which makes it kind of hard to
track current capabilities we're gonna
hit that so this is a really important
setting if you don't know much about
overclocking if you try to go into at
least on this board BIOS and overclock
the CPU
I just did and you don't set the current
limitations to max or at least higher
then it will current throttle and so you
actually won't get the overclock that
you wanted in a disable spread spectrum
and then DRAM current we're gonna max
that out as well don't expect the D ran
to be going over current but might as
well just eliminate any issues for us
early there's one more setting I think
ICC max is important just max that one
out actually there should be a couple
more to so one of the problems in in the
review that we brought up so this was in
the article but not in the video got cut
from the video due to time but some
boards out there are are actually
running with an ICC max that's higher
than Intel stock specification and so
those scores will be higher than than
what is considered stock it's kind of
like an MC e debate all over again I
talked about this in the review within
the first couple paragraphs so check out
the review article if you want to read
about that it was in the video but we
cut it for time let's just I don't know
what's like I don't know let's let's do
like one point two eight and just step
it down I'm actually not sure kind of
curious what the low is stable voltage
will be for this I need to max out the
fans too so let me get some super chats
while this is booting back in okay super
chats so we have ATO cthey it's a talk
'kathy so two dollars thank you watch
stream looks nice please share encoder
settings
it's just OBS with probably faster I
think I think it's just a six for faster
so all I'm doing right now is maxing out
the fans if the fan noise is completely
unbearable let me know but we're gonna
try and I'll just try and stay away from
them that way it's not too loud but we
do need the cooling capability that's
it's kind of the point of an
overclocking live stream
so all right there we go so super chats
we have Mustaine's by matt $2 good to
see you again
is that a PCO 11 dynamic in the corner
plans yes it is a PCO 11 dynamic and I'm
planning to use it from my production
machine in the office here so eventually
I'll be building my own system we have
ones for the editors now Patrick got one
so I just need my own production machine
at this point I plan to use that one
Doctor Who 8 6 75 3 or 9 $2.00 this is a
79 80 XE got that one already no toys
are for boys 666 thank you let there be
no evil in your CPU not sure donating
666 is going to help but I appreciate
your your reverse psychology
hopefully the CPU falls for it and at
the end there is no evil in it today
so 5 gigahertz pretty basic here I'm
going to move this over and you know we
should probably just go to let's go to
1080p make it a bit easier to see and
you got some more numbers in I don't
even know if this is gonna be stable I'm
at only one point to 8 volts input but
the actual voltage is gonna droop from
that I think so let's take a look at
that and just see what's what's
happening in that department so we care
about is V core is this motherboard yet
this is detected at the motherboards
right 1.27 currently let's see if it
even if it just freezes instantly or not
it shouldn't but we'll see so we dropped
to one point two three that's kind of
what I'm talking about I need to take a
DMM to the back of the socket your
invalidate but one point t7 gets me one
point two three something like that one
point two eight actually is what I put
in so this is something we talked to a
she's about they're aware of V droop on
the board and I don't know if they're
they plan to do anything with it or if
it's just an ICC whatever Intel thing
21:53 is our score for all Core 5
gigahertz and our original all core
baseline was 20 64 was that 2153 2153 is
the baseline there NT 5.0 all core ok
and let's just tell it to rot we already
actually don't need to run single
threaded because we already know what
that's going to score it's gonna squid
single-threaded so let's just go ahead
and do a 3d mark run while I'm catching
up through some of the super chats and
you know it not extreme let's just need
straight times by not extreme do I have
time spy on here yes the giant one time
aside
CPU physics only run custom all right
it's gonna be a bit lower cuz I'm runnin
hardware info at the same time but we do
need that data so it's important to have
it and let me read you to see if there
are any store purchases to shout out
while time supply is running here and
then we'll go through the test bench a
bit more in a minute so a couple store
orders thank you for sending those in we
have Eric from Cleveland Tennessee
picked up the new limited edition foil
graph logo shirt that's this one that
you were picking that up Eric you are
one of the first and you also got some
of the cobalt blue beer glasses
thankfully thank you for picking those
up helps us with the stream a lot to
place orders on the store because it's a
different completely different type of
content it's abuse compared to what we
normally do so it always helps get those
and Nicholas from North Carolina picked
up a also the limited edition Graff logo
shirt Thank You Nicholas so we got a
score and we read one more one or two
more of these
we got a Karen from Baltimore picked up
the limited edition shirt as well thank
you and one more here and we'll get back
to those and that we got uh here it is
we gots hey sis from California picked
up a limited edition shirt as well okay
so our score eleven thousand eight
thirty three let's just take this as a a
number for all core five gigahertz we'll
get a baseline later so let me just
separate this out five G all core and
this was eleven thousand eight thirty
three so strictly for perspective let me
open up a three more Hall of Fame
scoreboard and look at what these
straight times by CPU results are kind
at the high end just to give everyone
perspective of where this is falling so
times pi we want times by cpu scores
what I want time
spy CPU they not space it out okay
well anyway times by graphics score I
see CPU score it's not separated out
four times by standalone but it is four
times by extreme which of course I'm
very familiar with that benchmark so
anyway let's just look at our types by
extreme number for a second that was
twelve thousand for thirty three and I
think if we run this times by extreme
we're gonna where you get hit too hard
on the GPU side so I'm not going to
compare so let me go back two times pi
and we'll just pick the number let's
pick the number twenty result that's
what they sixty and seventy nine eighty
XE here's a good Saturday night ADRC
result with just straight x by fourteen
thousand three seventy eight for that
score and this person was running at an
unspecified frequency I think four point
seven gigahertz so they were at four
point seven gigahertz on the 79-80 X E
and same benchmark they got fourteen
thousand 378 now I don't know how good
that person's overclock is this is the
nineteenth results in the scoreboard but
we're at 11,000 833 just baseline and it
is an eight core this time kind of to
remember that so certainly better than
intel's previous processors for the same
thing let's see how are the temperatures
during all that we didn't do a whole lot
yet so we were maxing at in the sixties
we're doing pretty well pretty well for
temperatures part of this is the d lid
with liquid metal it brings us down a
couple degrees for sure and we'll have
more content on that later and part of
it is a 540 millimeter radiator with
four really high rpm fans hot and also
an open loop so we're doing okay for
thermals let's see let's just get a
number four v 4 51 51 X and in the
meantime we got a couple more super
chats and I need to catch up so I I
always get through all of them just be
advised that I run on a delay with super
chats because of the volume of them so
we have detuned $32.00 why does it
infinity fabric tick at ram speed i
don't have an answer for that that's
something I probably used to know when
we reviewed Rison 1000 series when it
came out and it might be in our review I
don't remember
but not something I've kept in my head
so sorry that I can't answer that right
now I'd have to I'd have to look it up I
don't memorize everything that we work
on unfortunately let's see Death Comes
it scrolled up there we go
death calm sqk 199 I pure did the 9900 K
on day one and Newegg hasn't shipped
that's messed up
come on new ik that's pretty messed up
alright so just set 51 and we're just
gonna keep it at one point to a ton till
I crashes which is really like 1.2 35
which is really low so it's doing pretty
well for for the Volt frequency curve I
would say what a dumb so for everyone
who watched Roman their power stream
what did he end up did he test with the
exotic coin or did he use like a liquid
cooler and what did he end up hitting
just curious not trying to compete with
them but curious what he got on the high
end if anyone knows it would be Roman
someone saying Amazon hasn't shipped yet
either
someone says Steve overclocked more this
isn't crashing so try more voltage on
higher frequency no no you don't do more
voltage if it's not crashing you do
higher frequency yes I'm starting to the
point is starting slow and working our
way up don't do more voltage if it's not
crashing that is the opposite of the
point okay so okay despite starting low
I actually do do kind of know what I'm
doing here so we hit 5.2 in our review
all core trivially and that's why we're
back here to actually try this time so
let's get a all core what is did we even
did I increase it to 51 I think I did
check in a second so what are they
saying what y'all saying about a Romans
you did seven point six or seven point
seven gigahertz on helium was it liquid
helium he did use liquid he'll him
that's pretty cool I'll to watch that
did he do any overclocking on a on
ambient like just on water cooling with
air I'd be curious what do you hit on
that
hi I'm their 7-point I'm here in 7.5
27.7 liquid healing that is pretty
pretty damn high look what a helium is
super expensive by the way compared to
liquid nitrogen
22:12 so is that that is a bit higher so
this is going to be 5 point 1 gigahertz
all core and we got 22 12 from
multi-threaded and then let's just go
ahead and let it through a single thread
just to see it shouldn't be too much
higher we're at 219 before I really
don't think it'd be too much higher it
loves 3 volts trust me I don't don't
believe definitely does not love 3 volts
4.8 it's on ambient 4.8 that can't be
right well the D H 15 I guess what was
he using for his software I guess if he
was using prime then yeah so there's a
prime is really nasty on these 900 K is
it it just instantly over he's instantly
even at 5.0 sometimes so prime is a
pretty abusive on these and blender is
an AV X workload but it didn't trigger
the same response which is why we use
blender in our thermal testing because
it's still a realistic use case and it
wasn't instantly thermal throttling it
okay so super chats and get a couple of
those definitely Relan five dollars
would you like some 3dfx cards for the
hologram to video call cards and another
I don't know hold on to them for now
because we're gonna do another fan mail
stream
I don't know I'm hoping maybe next week
and we needed to see what we even have
first because there's a lot of stuff in
there so definitely 3dfx beauties are
cool to have though but if you want on
you should hang onto them because it's
like piece of history at this point keV
ski 802 $2 liquid metal to soften solder
to remove from die liquid metal to
soften solder to remove from die
so oh I I don't know
would that work I'm not actually not
sure you have to talk to him but the
materials engineer Roman about that but
all I did was just scrape it off with a
knife so I guess I'm barbaric I don't
know it's going pretty well than me
Michael Hayes $10 would you recommend
going from an 8700 K to the 9900 K and
should I use my azrog Z 370 extreme for
motherboard I'm gonna say probably no
but let me look at what that motherboard
is I've not kept up with the z3 Sony
boards I am not sure how the power
delivery is on this board for the nine
NRK I would have to look into it if
build Zoids done one on this that would
be a good place to look but for
reference the 9900 K we were pushing
like 270 watts with a 5 gigahertz 1.3 5
volts set up and the reason for that was
to equate it to an 80 86 K so we used
really high voltage but 200 so T watts
kind of a lot of power so you keep that
in mind
it is certainly higher than the 8700 K
at the high end like once you start
pushing 5.2 gigahertz but out of the box
the power delivery should be fine if
you're running stock it's just when he
started overclocking like all core 5.2
I don't know how how all the different
board VRMs will hold up I haven't looked
into them l 4 R 5 men and okay 50 thank
you right should I use isopropanol to
clean at my monitor or bleach could you
I don't know you might as well just use
a mallet at that point I guess 225 so
5.1 gigahertz goddess a single core of
225 just for reference here so that's
five point one gigahertz versus 219
previously let's go ahead and get in did
we already get our we did not get our
time spot numbers yet for this pass so
let's get a time spy number in
and see how that scores I'm not gonna do
extreme because it will become GPU bound
almost instantly people are talking
about temperatures but overheating we
didn't really have too much overheating
issues on the x6 TT which is what we
used for everything it is a hot CPU but
what's not till I was doing like prime
that it was really genuinely overheating
constantly and that is an important
scenario to consider but it's not
something that that we really needed too
much to worry about because we were
focusing on blender tests for our
comparisons of solder versus paste when
we did that in the review and you should
check that out if you haven't seen the
review yet all right so this is gonna
run a baseline here let's go through the
components for those who who missed the
beginning of the stream that's gonna be
very loud the fans are kind of crazy
I'll head over the head over there he
can see hid so I has builds are done
anything - how about this evening no
actually I haven't worked with him on
this one
other than busy 50 90 godlike thing he
looked at this air is absurd so like I
don't know if you're gonna be able to
see it but this piece of foam with all
the screws on it is moving around from
the from the fans there you go it's
basically invisible and then this thing
this GM logo back here is moving from
the fans just like spinning on its own
so they're very loud let me walk you to
the parts first of all this is a
Patrick's in the room so I have to call
out Patrick's suspension bridge
engineering as Patrick you ever take any
any civil engineering classes in school
oh yeah Patrick says he played those
flash games where you build a bridge so
I think he's the most qualified to do
this this is a giant zip tie tied to a
rod holding 540 radiator that's very
heavy because we put water in it
obviously so that's our that's our
suspension engineering what fans are on
it we have ek VARs on there ek Vardar
furious excuse me very big difference
sorry about the fan noise kind of lose
it was my hair hot so far dark furious
for the fans there are four of these and
then we have some pump reservoir combo
from UK down here and we're not using
this we're not using the dual D DC pump
not using those today we're only using
this one and the board is a Maximus 11
hero I don't know how bad this VR I'm
guess I might want to put a fan on there
but it actually feels pretty ok right
now so that's cool it's also not doing a
lot right now
EK supremacy evo or whatever that box
called g.skill trident see black
thirty-six hundred megahertz right now
it's roughly I don't have a sixteen
eighteen eighteen and something will
look at the timings later power supply
is an ax sixteen hundred i RT x twenty
atti I think that covers it I can throw
a you know I'm gonna throw a current
clamp on here and we can have some fun
with seeing what kind of current draw is
there while we're running these tests so
let me grab that oh thank you
so it's pretty simple this is a current
clamp 0 it out
that's like absurd this kiss can scare
me it's the reason I have these cables
hooked up these ugly extensions is
because despite people saying things
like ketchup and mustard cables these
are the best cables 2 years so you can
actually see which ones you need to
clamp very easily and we have this pin
out on our mod mat so it does it does
show where they are but same place every
time it's standardized the yellow is 12
volt this runs nearest the the like clip
on the power header so that's gonna be
where that is let me see if I can get
this like kind of visible to camera
maybe without hitting a button somewhere
I don't know if I can get this visible
the camera or not we can open it up on a
phone if not
all right it's uh not really it's that
way I can clamp this I'm just gonna put
it there
and then if we have to we can roll in
closer so let me run another test after
I log this data so for that run twelve
thousand twenty one points and that is
at five point one gigahertz we can of
course go higher and that was with just
straight times by physics and then we
had a twenty one fifty three previously
so we've definitely gone up and we'll
look at the power
the current clamp in a minute and look
at the power consumption that should be
pretty fun let me know I spark an insult
not today just a 540 so alright let's
let's go through some more of these
super chats got a lot of them so like I
said I've run on a delay with the super
chats I do get them all but because of
the volume I'm always a bit behind so
first one is from Shelby boost five
dollars with the AC's Maximus formula
what are called the RMB better for
overclocking so from a vrm standpoint
it's very good as far as just looking at
the water-cooled part of it those VR abs
once they're that good you can just
blast them with air and they'll be fine
so water cooling the VR M is really nice
from the standpoint of you put it in a
system and use it properly not like this
in other words then it's much easier to
make sure the vrm is cool you don't
really have to worry about anything but
for purposes of like what we're doing
here you just put a fan over top of a VR
M without a heatsink on it and you'll be
fine the other problem with so it's a if
it's a mono block or if it shares the
same loop then you can run into a
problem where you're sharing all this
heat from the vrm and if it's like
before the cpu that's going to heat your
liquid temperature before it hits the
cpu and that'll drive up the cpu
temperatures as a result because it's
not getting as cold of a cooling medium
going through it and the VR AIIMS can
take 125 C plus so second in the loop
makes more sense for those since they're
gonna be fine with warmer water from the
CPU anyway that was our score
so what do we want to do next I guess
let's do it
so let's wheel the camera back over and
look to see if you can look at the
current clamp and we're gonna try and
show the power consumption during just a
time spy pass that is stable so what
we're gonna try and show the current
clamp here and what you'll be looking at
is the amperage so give us a second
Ridge moving the camera over and that is
hooked up to the EPS 12-volt cables so
not super visible maybe I can I can
manipulate it if I have to focus it got
a focus on it
there it goes okay cool okay so that's
kind of legible 2.1 yes that is somewhat
legible let's uh let's let me run it I'm
gonna click run and you should be able
to see what's going on there we go that
looks better as part of the numbers
cutoff but I can move it around so this
is going to show the current are these
both going the same direction yes so
there's a showing current basically
multiply that number by about 12 and
that gives you watts it's not really
doing anything right now I think it's
launching the benchmark so it's not
pulling any power oh no it's running
there it goes
so we're eight nine ten twelve so I'm
seeing 12 amps let me just do that math
quickly here thirteen point two so
that's okay let's just call it a peak of
thirteen point three that I've seen so
far that puts us at about 160 watts
really not that high compared to what we
know it can it can push but that gives
you an idea and I see they're super chat
so I'll get to them also get some more
of the store orders so yeah that's about
160 watts for that so far let's do I'm
gonna run another one so that was times
by owner on Cinebench in all core just
to give you an idea of how the power
consumption might differ between the two
so here is Cinebench all core and this
one's pushing about fifteen point eight
maybe from what I can see from here
anyway and that's 190 watt so that's
definitely getting up there
now this is before the vrm so this does
account for VRM
power a bit as well so if someone says
95 watt TDP as if they're making fun of
it so first of all we're overclocked and
I've over vaulted it so yeah of course
95 watt TDP doesn't apply that's not
even a good a good job at Intel high
secondly this motherboard as we
discussed in the review that so this
board is one of the few that actually
does stick to Intel spec so IC c-max it
stays pretty close to 100 watts and
it'll lock there when it wants more
power it'll still lock there on this
board unless you manually override it
whereas some of the MSI and gigabyte
boards have that same kind of MCE debate
going on I'm gonna run another one let
me run single threaded while I'm talking
just so you see that power consumption
so those will will end up drawing more
than then the Asus board does and they
also hold a bit higher wattage and sorry
bit higher clocks as a result of being
allowed to pull more power so anyway
this is just single thread in Cinebench
just to give you an idea of what one
thread pulls at this frequency and
voltage this is not a part of the review
check review for that obviously but
that's about 36 watts so anyway let's uh
let me launch one more I don't know if
Prime's gonna be stable but I will
launch it just to illustrate a point
here so let's pull up prime95 I'm just
gonna use what's already on here we have
an on a V X and we have an AV X version
let's use a V X it's gonna be very
abusive might crash we'll see now I'm
gonna run small FFT actually not I'm
gonna do a custom run and we're just
gonna do 8x8 for the FFT size it's
extremely abusive it's probably gonna
overheat but let me get up hardware info
as well and keep an eye on that current
clamp when I hit start here so if it
doesn't crash we can see what the power
consumption is so reminder we're at 5.1
G
and starch might crash might overheat we
haven't done either yet
what's our power so this is 23 amps just
to give you an idea
compared to the previous numbers that is
quite high that's two hundred and
seventy-six watts so nothing's changed
here so one says move camera I mean it's
pointed out a current clamp look the
look at the number on the clamp so yes
this is is extremely different from the
from the Cinebench and times by results
which is why this particular workload is
very abusive and we're at let's see
we're at about 70 degrees so let's bring
the camera back over now that we've
gotten that we're at about 70 degrees
for the temperatures and we're going to
show the screen now that you've seen the
current clamp so that gives you a pretty
good idea for Y prime is just so rough
on these chips a very good thermal
stressor but we've been using blender a
lot recently because it's realistic it's
a V X and just like Prime is a V X but
it's it's not quite as bad all right
so
here's the prime still running back here
are we on all course still as if any of
them looks like we dropped one thread so
it's not stable which is expected Oh
actually that one just seems to think
we've dropped two threads there we go
yeah we're dropping a few threads at
this point but the other threads that
stayed alive are in the 70s so we're
pretty good for thermals right now which
is largely thanks that massive radiator
so okay enough of that let's push this
higher we don't need too much voltage
today for these benches so far but we
will get there okay
will there be another overclocking
battle for this chip I don't know we're
definitely gonna do one for the 9090 DXE
assuming any of us get it and I still
need to follow up with our Saturday
night exe and put it under dice put on a
dry ice now well the CPU is not using
twenty three amps single core that was
that was that was prime95 across all
cores of course it wasn't single core it
was using 36 watts single cores using
like three amps um okay so what would
the temps be like on the stock cooler
though well see it as there is no stock
cooler I would say quite high so let's
just do 52 I know that was stay only for
I am NOT gonna change the voltage and
it's gonna crash but I'm curious so it's
at 1.28 let's just see what that does
while that's booting back up you should
have had PT on for an overclocking
collab alright then we got a couple
super chats couple stories so we had
some store orders as I said before one
of the best ways to support us during
these live streams is to buy from the
store on store Nigerians access not and
that super chats of course we also
readin are also very appreciated the
store that was one of the best ways to
help us out if you do want to support
what we do so Michael from California
picked up the the brand new foil Graff
logo shirt this one right here that is
limited edition we're gonna put them out
for until quantity goes through or just
putting out the mouth
pre-order now to figure out what the
size allocation is for everyone so we
can allocate our quantity to those sizes
appropriately and then once they sell
out they're gone just like the previous
one which is back there in the middle so
that one sold out within about two weeks
last time maybe two and a half something
like that so that way faster than we
thought but do you want one it's on
store like Andrews exes net and no
promises but I will try to shout out the
name so people who buy them as they come
in
we're very happy with this new graph
logo foil shirt it looks pretty damn
cool very reflective next one is from
Ashton from Washington who also picked
up the new limited graph logo shirt
Thank You Ashton we got one from Evan in
Alabama picked up the same shirt Thank
You Evan for the foil graph logo shirt
pick up and we got Andrew from Ontario
and Canada picked up one as well and we
go through a couple more here we had one
from Stephen and Australia going a long
way for that one so you've got picked up
the graph logo foil shirts as well
two more to read through here Christos
from New York picked up one of the mod
mats autograph Thank You Christos and
we'll get those out shortly I might have
to go signed some more soon Ian from
Pennsylvania picked up the foil shirt
and I have actually yep there's one more
here Marco from Zurich in Switzerland
picked up the limited graph short shirt
as well last one
Corey from Alabama picked up the GN
award crystal and one of our teal logo
anniversary shirts thank you very much
for those orders so here we go we're at
5.2 now I have not changed the voltage
it is still low and we're just gonna
watch it crash I think is probably
what's gonna happen so let's let's see
it let's see what happens to it here is
it gonna insta crash
are they gonna take a minute voltage is
pretty low right now although it might
be enough I haven't really tested the
low end of this I was just doing the
quick and dirty overclock and get it
done and make sure it it's a why for the
test super chat from Daniel or Rose niak
two dollars how do you think t 9800 X
will line up against this I'm not sure
extra memory channel should be
interesting for some things 2265 did not
crash but that's a pretty short test so
let's let me create a line item for this
5.2 G all core 2265 previously we're at
20 to 12 for 5.1 and let's go ahead and
just get some scaling in here so we can
plot it pretty nicely we'll run a single
core just to see how it increases over
you know 100 megahertz at a time what
the increases are we had another stupid
chat from New Age culture $10 hey Steve
party in a PC right now and wanting a
smooth-running streaming gaming PC
thinking about these D 390 with an 8700
k with an F tw3 1080i would that do or
should I wait for the 900k price isn't a
factor for me so first of all the 1080i
I agree with as a purchasing choice if
there's still about the same price as
2080s I haven't looked at in about a
week but I definitely agree with the
decision to go with 1080i because the
the value propositions there's just so
much better than r-tx right now so
you're good there is e 390 with an 8700
k I feel like it's kind of overkill and
you could say but I want to upgrade
later but if that's what you're saying
then I then I think you're doing it
wrong because if your plan is by Z 319
now with an 8000 series CPU and then by
a 9000 series TV which just came out
later kind of wasting money so I'd say
the guys III 70 with your 8000 series
because e 394 the 9000 series to answer
that motherboard aspect as for streaming
game we have this may interest you we
have screen benchmarks in our review of
the 1901 up today we have a huge video
section on it that has side by side and
playback fortnight and dota 2
just some basic games everyone pretty
much watches at this point and tested
the 2700 X versus the 9900 K both stock
to see how they did and just to give you
an idea this stream is playing back to
you I think with h.264 faster and the
quality is pretty damn good so faster
will run on any of those CDs or on 2700
X just fine you could save a lot of
money by going with that route the 9900
K is absolutely superior in a technical
sense insofar as its numbers are higher
where they need to be higher and lower
where they need to be lower most of the
time for those streaming benchmarks
power consumption thermal is not really
a part of the consideration here we're
just talking about the FPS and the frame
encoding throughput so yes it's better
the question is does that does that
better 'no sacktual ii get you anything
do you care because the 2700 X can
deliver objectively the same experience
to the viewer at similar encoding levels
assuming you're below medium so if
you're at like fast or faster which are
both completely acceptable quality
levels you're fine on a 2,700 extra fine
on an 80 700 K which you've parted out
here if you wanted to stick with intel
on that gen some reason it's fine if you
want to go medium or up then you're
looking at either h EDT 9900 Cato's
medium pretty damn well or you can start
overclocking things or you could get a
secondary system so we got a result back
here to 29 last thing I want to say on
that question though because it is a
good one is if you are what we've
learned from our streaming tests is you
do drop some of the frame time
consistency a bit as you start streaming
so there's some concern over over your
low-end frame time performance falling
off as you start streaming on the same
host system and to resolve that you
basically need an external system so if
you're like hyper-competitive csgo
player and you need every frame you can
get probably want a secondary system
instead but for the most part the the
cpu these days can handle both just fine
and Vianca has been update
as well so I haven't tested it yet okay
so that's gonna run time spot gave us a
baseline there still haven't crashed I
need to check hardware info on the next
run and I didn't turn on for this one
because I don't want it to contaminate
the results will turn on for the next
run and see if we're hitting any kind of
issues thermally or otherwise next
question is from Adam Schumann two
dollars no live notification sorry
YouTube does funny things lately and it
scrolled down next one Eric Hobart $10
has pre-ordered one of those shirts and
Ford beer glasses I saw yours and read
it out thanks very much good luck with
the overclocks thank you Eric for
picking those up we appreciate it
I hope you enjoy it Louis two dollars
how jealous are you about Linus's a
hematite dragon I saw that did he stream
out today I saw that that was like it's
funny it wouldn't fit in our door so he
can have it I guess um seems like the
kind of thing - would get it's very line
is it suitable for him in his office
12,000 147 versus 12,000 21 previously
so we're going up for sure
and let's do another one with hardware
info running so this will contaminate
the results a bit but I want to see
where's our you know let's run it on a
stress for a little bit stressed just a
stress test actually I'll do a looping
CPU test here so we're gonna loop the
CPU test and we are going to run a
windowed looping and abled run custom
and then what we're gonna do is look at
the hardware info readout while I go so
I'm gonna let it kind of heat up for a
bit and then we'll check the numbers in
it and about a maybe two or three
minutes and see where the core is
sitting at that point for the frequency
and voltage we specified also I need to
make sure it's actually got all cores
enabled which it does so zero to seven
so that's eight cores and just playing
around with that earlier do I need to
overclock is the UH the uncor as well I
haven't
and that definitely needs to go up but
that'll be pretty interesting to see how
much that impacts results sure fifty two
hundred for everything and V course
should be pretty low I think so it says
one point two seven right now let's see
what it says when it runs the benchmark
I probably need to run the stress test
instead one point two six pretty damn
low but this is through the motherboard
so I don't have a better readout than
that right now I'm actually gonna cancel
this and run stress test instead so it
doesn't have the loading screen in
between because I kind of I realize
that's gonna be an issue stress test go
away stop it just die just die 3dmark
okay turn it around a stress test I'll
loop and see what our temperatures look
like under a 540 rad with really loud
fans deleted with liquid metal I should
walk through all the respects again in a
second let's just run that loop and see
what that gives us so okay a couple of
things to read through let me check out
normal chat house normal chat doing
what's normal chat say chat do you not
agree we need gamers Nexus body pillows
so I see chat hasn't changed at all
it's the last time I checked on chat
make sure it's not on game yeah yeah
that was a not a great on I'm waiting
for chat that say it's something waiting
and I've been disappointed before don't
disappoint me again okay so we got love
your show thank you appreciate it
hi Steve we're good good to hear good to
hear the chat spokesperson has has
spoken for all of you you're all good
I assume you collected congregated and
and came to a mutual agreement on your
answer what else we're to go there was
an actual question there somewhere
where'd it go something about the 900k
pre-orders I can't find it I found
another one though so this stream made
me try and get my 7700 K from 4.9 to 5.0
up and running without errors with 1.2
88 well it's nice that's always really
cool to hear I'm always glad to hear
that the overclocking live streams
encourage people to try doing more of
their own overclocking cuz it's pretty
fun and if it's even on our production
systems so I pushed one of our
production machines to 5 gigahertz all
core on an 80 86 K which is not
impressive we've done 5.35 on those but
it is a significant uplift from stock
which is like 4.3 all core and we need
it to be stable so I can only sacrifice
so much stability for production but
it's way faster and it's pretty fun to
do so glad to hear chat is some of you
are are inspired by the overclocking
livestream let's check on those numbers
so when I open these up and it's fine
what am I looking for here I look for
core temperatures there we go
so there's our cores running very cool
right now with time spy it's not a heavy
load though what kind of current are we
drawing in this benchmark I think the
bench just ended so I'm gonna have to
wait a second don't let goes okay so for
currents it's gonna zero this meter out
and get a clamp reading it's four
something's weird that's not right
four oh it's cuz basically GPU because
the stress test doesn't have a looping
physics test that's annoying you know
what let's uh what some people wanted
prime earlier wanted blender
let's do prime and let's do a non a VX
prime so we're gonna do prime twenty six
point six I think it's compatible and
it's not a VX so it's abusive but it's
not as abusive not nearly as abusive and
we're gonna do custom we're gonna do
eight by eight fast Fourier transforms
and we're gonna run those in place it's
a let go so here's an on a V X workload
this is comparable to like maybe a
gaming workload or something like that
kind of a stressful gaming workload if
your CPU bound and there's our
temperatures so we're in the 60 is 270
right now with that workload theis why
wasn't enough it was only pushing so
that's why the current clamps nice the
only putting in three apps it wasn't
really doing anything and that's because
if the GPU is doing everything
apparently a stream went down for a
second but his back so I mean they'll
check on that looks like if the stream
is fine so duh should be here if you
dropped out alright sex chat is spamming
refresh stream is fine just refresh it's
amazing how quickly people drop out
without hitting at five alright so I
don't know where it uh he didn't go a
small F of T no I went smaller FFT I did
eight by eight custom f of T is so this
is twenty six point six I don't I want
to dropped out is it is it live or what
it's still playing or is YouTube no it's
still playing okay cool cool looks good
so yeah we're doing prime95 twenty six
point six and that is was Linus live
okay
I see Linus last time when we were live
and we beat his score he sent like $31
donations which probably what is one
Canadian to USD so he was he was
basically throwing 75 cents at me over
and over the period of like an hour
after we beat his score I told him I'd
get him back you know I haven't had a
chance to do that yet I think this is a
pretty good chance to do that I pull up
our chat on one side and get his window
on the other use alt f4 to refresh don't
do that I don't know if anyone still
falls for that that's kind of crazy I
don't see a stream your must only be on
is the only on twitch right now I guess
I'm looking for it PCWorld $5 keep up
the good work Steve thanks PC world so
we we featured our discussion with
Gordon on PC worlds channel in our 900k
review where Gordon's it was actually
pretty good clip Gordon said to me he
was talking about the solder intel
solder Tim and he said so
they're giving us what we wanted you
can't complain now right and I said you
can always complain then Gordon just
said okay so the key thing core at
Gordon's with it Gordon is our Thane so
this thing 26.6 prime95 non AVX workload
running at 60s to 70 for the high end
looking at 71 degrees Celsius for the
worst case we're doing pretty damn well
for temperature I am I'm happy with that
result so let's drop that out and get
back into BIOS and see how much more we
can push it we're really not pushing
voltage that much yet so looking pretty
good and I need to keep an eye out for
when - the stream goes live - of course
and also I'm going to tweet out a link
to ours let everyone know that if it
went down for them it came back see
stream is back up if you head down time
stream is back up okay so that's
rebooting that's we're gonna go into
BIOS after I it's on this tweet almost
missed it
the monitor is a lot cleaner now okay
cool
so screw the backup now live overclock
in AD lidded 9900 k with liquid metal
we're not overclocking it with liquid
metal but it has liquid metal and we're
we're overclocking it alright super
chats coming in I'll check those in a
second - is up now okay cool so I'll
send him a bunch of nickels and pennies
and then Hannah - yes so we have you
know that's just type in 53 and watch it
crash so we can all be satisfied with
that result and then start pushing the
voltage up after that it's got a crash
at some point here alright
so super chats we got I got Lewis's
murder two dollars what a i/o cooler do
you recommend its stock no overclock so
we were using at 280 CLC and stock it
did completely fine for blender it was
like I want to say in the 60s maybe but
that was with a Seuss's Auto voltage so
voltage on motherboards is variable it
depends on how well tuned it is I think
it crashed before you included by the
way so we finally got our crash you
wanted and the better the board with
with the better pro or a BIOS the more
likely you are to run lower temperatures
stock because some boards will blast the
voltage when stock just for no reason
just because they're bad so that's
something to keep an eye out for so we
finally had a crash and restart amp
Peter DKK 50 a donation towards a
haircut by the way smash records I cheer
for you well take the money for for the
record smash in for ice in the future
alright
53 did not work out let's just bump that
voltage 1.4 which is really gonna be
1.35 with V group next one tostito
bandido
one of the best names $2 please shout
out CPU and VRM
as you go up we do that I keep an eye on
it David Connelly $7 do you think the
Nvidia that Nvidia should make a cheaper
20 8020 atti in 2070 without r-tx
features also is it worth going as
computer engineering the first half of
the question feel like a cheaper 20 8020
atti in 2070 without our TX features
already exist and it's called the entire
10 series Sun Fetty already made it
they just even keep making it yes that
was my answer and well I don't think
they should I think I should keep making
intensities but they're not going to is
it worth going to computer engineering
do you like it I guess they're plenty of
fields you don't have to go to school
for it but it can't help just depends on
what you're trying to do and there are a
lot of jobs that are worth looking into
in the industry if you like this
industry so people often overlook jobs
like Technical Marketing that's really
cool on a lot of our interfaces with
different companies are in technical
marketing and despite the name marketing
they are often the least BS people in
the whole company so they kind of are
there between PR and us and they handle
technical questions and almost every
time give very straight answers and if
you're like if you're fairly technical
but you're not an electrical engineer
that's a really good field to look into
okay let's do Cinebench baseline or
actually yeah we need to see if it's
even stable we're at 5.3 now which is
where it was not stable last time I
tried this but I am going to try hit
hard this time so let's see if 5.3 will
hold I'm gonna guess no that is going to
be my guess I think it's gonna crash
within 15 seconds and if it doesn't then
that'll be really cool but it wants to
right blender so it's not really stable
all right Steve it goes support Linus
yes let's let's give a line us a couple
of pennies and nickels just to get them
back are they talking out they are
talking there's there shows basic alive
okay so if you missed it when we did our
oh it passed twenty - ninety-two so when
we did our stream
where I beat Linus's team single card
score accidentally like legitimately it
was by accident
Linus then threw a bunch of of single
dollar donations at us and so I'm gonna
get them back here what should I say
what do i what should I say to Linus in
my super chat donation let's do
everybody's not even gonna notice it
he's gonna take all the money okay so
let's do a 1kg 75 cents cuz that's what
he gave me
I think it's 76 C 76 cents I won't let
me so let me let me do a dollar so when
Linus did this to us his Hut his credit
card was frozen because he did it too
much I'm just try and avoid that but
let's I keep in mind I can't hear Linus
the stream so open up both of them cuba
side by side and see let me know if he
if he even sees the donation because I
have a feeling he's not going to he's
gonna take all the money and and no one
will have any fun okay so I'm gonna run
this single thread get our new baseline
or a new score of a 5.3 gee
it keeps wanted me to send one dollar by
and send so I'm just spamming - is
stream with super chats right now it's
almost definitely gonna try and freeze
my card - shouldn't make sure my phone's
not muted okay sorry I'm gonna do one
more maybe two
so that's running a this is running
single threaded Cinebench 5.3 gigahertz
right now and for voltage I put in at
1.4 with B drip we're probably 1.35 when
I open up hardware info next and then
after that we can we can push another
time spy score and then see if we can
get up to maybe five point four that
would be pretty cool
but I don't think five point three is
genuinely stable even though it survived
Cinebench I do not think it's stable
because it crashed in blender when I did
this last time so alright let me do one
more to them this time I have to give
can you send an actual message with one
dollar no Kenya oh yeah there's a $2
only two dollars okay
just getting you back actually dance -
dance okay that's better
dance lioness with your new dragon
alright let me know if he if he
acknowledges any other like pretty sure
Linus is aware of years what's this
alright yeah I need to like I need to
call a credit card companies or
something and say like hey just to let
you know there's gonna be a hundred one
dollar spends on my card but I it's it's
just an internet trolling attempt no
it's totally intentional don't worry
about it okay so he said Alliance is
$1.00 hope you're all happy
well they noticed they just noticed
someone sighs okay cool alright nice
I see Luke laughing so I pretty much
know what that sounds like in my head at
this point do one more two more I can
stop anytime I want
really alright it's just so easy alright
good enough okay let's get back to this
so this is still rounding single
threaded so for the store purchases
thank you very much again for picking
those up on the picking up our new
limited edition foil graph logo shirt on
the store it's sort of a quad foil you
could say it's a it's a four-way SLI
foil setup and that is limited edition
we're posting it now to figure out the
sizing distribution it's pretty damn
reflective which is cool for camera and
if you want to pick one up we will not
be making them again once we saw out the
last one sold out in about two weeks
maybe two and a half so we'd expect
these will sell out within the next I
don't know it'll be pretty short term
though does not take long to go through
these so thank you for the support one
of the best ways that support us while
we're live-streaming and we need to get
back to overclocking but let me read a
couple of these Blake from Little Rock
picked up the graph logo shirt the
standard graph logo shirt and the cobalt
blue tear down glass thank you very much
we had an order from Levi and Florida
picked up the oh yeah the zipper hoodie
the the zipper hoodies back in stock the
winter hoodies are back i restocked
those recently for the colder weather
Sean from Oklahoma picked up a limited
edition foil shirt let me read one
here no guarantees I'll get to yours but
I will try due to volume can always get
them dustin from canada picked up one as
well okay so we got our result in this
is 232 for single-threaded just to give
you a comparison to where we were
previously we started at single-threaded
of 219 and we climbed to 225 at 5.1
gigahertz we then went to and that
starting was complete stock I believe
and then or yeah complete stock and then
we went up to 229 5.2 and we got to 32
5.3 5.3 shouldn't be stable so I'm not
gonna complain too much I guess but
let's uh let's kind of dirty the scores
a bit and run the hardware info while
we're doing this just to see what kind
of numbers I'm getting so it does in
fact say 5.3 so that's good so just
reading 5.3 we're not on anywhere close
to overheating that liquid metal and the
radiator are doing their work for sure
and I should walk through that bench
again too so we're in the seventies
right now pretty damn good what's our V
core think it is it thinks it's so one
point three nine when it's not running
sounds correct when it's running we have
V Group throw one point three five ish
reading from the motherboard be a soft
or not the best way to do it but it's
the best measurement I have right now
does this report vrm temperatures it
probably does I'll have to dig for them
and I'm at a weird viewing angle on the
screen so we have some temperature
sensors in the 30s there we go
no that's obviously inaccurate okay well
we're not going to go by those then
temp 9 not sure that is 90 see either
way CP is fine that's all it really
matters how is the V around though it's
let's do the field test it's not hard
enough to make me recoil so it's under
60 degrees Celsius that's that's how you
know what temperature the vrm is okay so
we're good there let's get our time
spice core in and then we can we try to
push it harder I guess I do
uncor a bit too I'm pretty damn sure
there's a not stable in a real work lat
but times pi should be a decent stressor
as well let's run that cpu test only so
that does not take too long to do we got
another store order thank you for
sending that in Phillip from Alberts
Leia oh really
lay limited-edition foil shirt thanks
for picking that up I'm gonna check on
chat what's chat saying what did Linus
think did they say anything or did they
just laugh Linus said call I don't
believe you I'm not gonna fall if it out
of this time you completely disrupted
Linus's stream nice okay hi Linus
probably can't hear us so honey we're
5.3 running times by right now Linus
thinks your card got blocked I'll prove
to him that it didn't send super chat
$2.00 my viewers say you think my card
got blocked is this a ploy to get more
money out of me convinced to prove that
you're wrong I guess I have to give five
dollars to send that message
okay all right they're tech deals is
doing it out - he just sent them one -
holler on their stream all right okay so
time spies score 12,000 for 19 keep me
in the loop on what they're saying doing
12,000 for 19 four times by that's
pretty damn good
I don't know why it's surviving let's
run a let's run prime it might be just
surviving because the temperatures are
so much lower than last time
so let's just run prime no AVX and we're
gonna do eight by eight okay let's see
if this survives this this is not a VX
it's not the worst case but will be
pretty bad and we'll do a VX next I'm
pretty sure that I'll crash it there so
in the 80s for prime that's to be
expected
are all the cores alive is the question
all of the cores are are in fact alive
at five point three four now let's do a
check on the current clamp so this over
here is our current clamp and it's gonna
be upside down sorry but try and zoom on
that I guess maybe I should try and do
Wow okay that's still accurate all right
can you see that okay so 23.9 24 amps
right now into the EPS 12 volt headers
on our clamp
so whatever 24 times 12 is gonna give
you our power consumption in watts and I
need to get through our own Super chats
in a second but so 12 by 24
it's about 288 Watts right now it's
pretty damn high hasn't crashed we've
got one core at 90 the rest are doing
pretty damn well and let me walk you
through this setup again for those of
you who has been kind of flowing a bit
so we have some people not have been
here earlier to see the brilliant setup
that we have so first of all allow me to
point out again the suspension bridge
engineering we have with a tight rope
hey I believe I believe the verge calls
these tweezers we use the tweezer to
hold the he rather wobbly pull here
yikes to at the test bench that's got a
540 millimeter radiator on it's one of
those thin ones I think
Ek calls those s e and like I said
earlier the whole point of this was
originally I don't want to do ice
because I felt like that was too
unrealistic we do that later but I kind
of wanted to do something more realistic
so I start with an open loop and then I
put that on it so it's not that realize
the anywhere we have EK Furious fans
flying really high RPM thus are allowed
RTX 20 80 i the motherboard we have an
ASUS Maximus 11 hero that's holding up
pretty well it's not a tree coil
temperature yet that fear heatsink so
assuming it's sinking heat okay it's
doing pretty well and then we have a
g.skill Trident II black for the memory
I need to start overclocking some of
that as well so we're at 5.3 right now
that is certainly higher than our review
so that's pretty great in our review I
stopped at 5.2 I was having crashing
issues we're at 91 see in this test for
some of the cores so this is a
this is going to push the limits of what
we can do if we were to use Prime but we
can still keep pushing Cinebench and
even we've never done sort of a
Cinebench live overclocking screen
before I've got time spy in there as
well but Cinebench is different and kind
of fun to do pretty interesting to see
the scores realistic using irradiated at
that no case I know of other than maybe
Thermaltake could mount yeah I mean that
was the that was the that was the joke
so we're gonna reboot see if I can do
before I start doing uncor at this point
I like to keep on core about four points
under and multiplier the all core
multiplier but I want to see a five
point four will hold as well so let's do
that first let's chat saying put it in
the refridgerator
I'm not going to do that alright so
let's see if it crash that 5.4 we do
have all chords on right yes I don't
know why this is so stable this time I
guess it's the cooling is really
beneficial oh yeah I forgot to mention
again - has moved on someone's ass okay
finally uh-huh so I forgot to mention
for those who have just joined recently
the CPU is deleted I show the delayed
process in the review which is on the
channel and in that process we of course
encountered the solder the as Intel
calls it's Tim oreste Tim and the solder
is indium it's really soft it's pretty
easy to remove it's pretty easy to crack
I wouldn't recommend deleting this time
for most of you if you're really trying
to push the limit like what we're doing
today then yeah liquid metal is gonna
get you further removing that silicon
adhesive and thus reducing the gap
between the IHS and the dye
significantly helps in cooling the
reason the Intel stem is not as good as
things like liquid metal based on their
Barris testing and and some of our own
coming up is because the liquid metal is
a really thin sheet and the solder is
pretty thick I don't know exactly what
Roman said it was for thickness but I
don't know if it was the adhesive or the
stem the way one of those two is 0.5
millimeters pretty damn thick and that
inhibits the thermal transfer efficiency
so so that's why we're seeing better
numbers of liquid metal even though it
is a soldered chip but props to Intel
for doing solder finally because it is
better and that is important so we're
definitely overall in a better spot than
we were previously it's a I just closed
hardware info I need it open
all right 5.4 is is clocking in here ish
and is it gonna survive let's just send
a bench first I feel like that's more
likely to survive so much okay so is how
quickly will it crash or will it crash
we're not overheating on anything and
that is because it froze so as you can
see the thermals are quite good right
now it's not - any work I kind of like
the old view so do you screen better
frowny face is too stupid for me I can't
take it I got to read a sort of our own
stupid shots in a second give me a
second to get through those people are
saying they're 19 I heard caper yours
didn't ship from Amazon that's very
unfortunate
okay so we got Ben quickly two dollars
thank you please do it long-sleeve
shirts we've heard the request we'll
start looking into it a couple of you
have asked for those recently we do have
the Raglan hoodies on the store we have
the winter hoodies on the store as well
of course
so 5.4 no good let's bump that a bit 1.4
- how about that one point four two zero
four chat we got Tom's and ok 20 thank
you very much for the super chat
donation what cpu is it and does it have
a ray tracing it's it's not a setter
yeah exe this time it does it doesn't
have Ray Ray's actually the CPU has more
ray tracing than RT oxidize I guess in
that you cannot you can use it for
production tasks that involve rendering
things with ray tracing in not real-time
tre waters five dollars do you think
that the Maximus 10 heroes each be Sony
vrm it can handle overclocking the 900k
to five to five point two gigahertz
giving silicon lottery for 24/7 where do
you recommend the Maximus 11 I
even tested this on the 10 the 10 is
tied up in another test bench right now
that's great question though I will make
a note that we want to look into that
because that is a good question
so Maximus X with 9900 K okay we can you
can look into that
alright is it just gonna die instantly
again
or will it survive this time I go with
die instantly or throttle next question
Matt arias $2.00 what block are using ek
supremacy Evo I believe is what we're
using it did not seem to like this very
much okay my friend
oh let's see why I didn't like it I
think we right we're about of the limits
I'm fine threes pretty damn good oh yeah
yeah okay so it is crashing but it's not
as bad of a crash but it is a crash so
it doesn't count
let's do let's see times five times five
I'll do it if not you start playing out
Suncor next that's a very important
number that we need to log as well so I
did get numbers for 5.3 for everything
let's it survived that all right we got
a a been our chick two dollars you're
flickering LED keyboard is driving me
crazy
sorry there you go I turned them off my
logitech or no not even that my
Microsoft keyboard over here though
doesn't seem to bother anyone
the one from probably fifteen years ago
or more
okay our car ten dollars no message
thank you very much mister Fiero ten
dollars I've got a sixty seven hundred a
4.5 G one point three volts gtx 980ti i
play 1080p at 144 Hertz what an eighty
seven hundred K or ninety seven RK
benefit me in FPS and also occasional
720p streams not sure how much my CPU is
limiting my GPU honestly not a whole lot
like in games maybe you're gonna be more
limited in your streaming than you are
in your gaming for the most part 1080p
144 Hertz okay 144 hurts a bit of a
different story but hey it's right
so you upgrade I don't think you should
upgrade to an 8700 K at this point it's
good CPU but it doesn't really matter
now I kind of I want to see what happens
to the 8700 price in a couple weeks and
I want to see what happens to the 9900
price in a few weeks you're pretty happy
on your system now I'd say just wait see
what happens come Black Friday stuff
like that see if anything pops up we
have benchmarks that can help you there
with your questions so we have the 4790k
which isn't too distant from your cpu in
our 99 hundred k review so you can look
at that number look at the 8700 k number
and then kind of extrapolate a middle
that's where you are and then you can
look at the Niner k k compared to those
midpoints and figure out if it's
worthwhile for streaming 720p 60 is
really not that abusive you can use envy
encoder for that well you can use your
1080 Ti is on V ank for that just fine
you don't need the CPU to do that so I
would I met I would be pretty happy with
your system the way you have it set up
it does not seem like it needs an
upgrade at 144 Hertz if you're like you
can't hit 144 you're unhappy with it
then you ask upgrade but I'll point you
to our benchmarks to figure out which
parts you need to upgrade because I
guess it depends on what kind of games
you're playing
so 12,000 521 was our score for that
past week is it survived it did not
survive Cinebench
and let me type that down so this is
five point four G five point four
gigahertz all Core Cinebench did not
finish and times pi was 12 521 okay what
was our max temperature 76 to 80 not bad
definitely survivable pretty cool okay
so let me uh let me check on chat let's
chat up to you
how's Chad doing right now so what says
Lowell GPU encoding for streaming it's
fine the guys talking 720p like envy
encoders completely fine for that if you
really want to use the CPU for it sure
but if you're streaming to youtube I
think you'll be hard-pressed to see any
legitimate difference between them like
if you did a blind test 720p really you
think Envy encoder can't handle that
alright so chat what's going on
cinematic 15 crafted up maybe well we'll
try it again see what it does
I just restarted it to see if that um if
that did anything different for
stability and it's corrupted I can get
it obviously get it easily enough
Cinebench certainly possible so
corrupted or unstable I haven't changed
the frequency or voltage so I will have
to do that
if we get a blue screen I'll feel more
comfortable that if we get the the
Cinebench error message so what about
this freeze for a second while I do
check it on chat and everything
someone says nothing wrong with Sandy
Ridge that's definitely accurate Sandy
Bridge is a damn good product still
today what software to track CPU heat so
we're using hardware info 64 for just
everything read out hard when put 64 is
by my favorite software utility for
login anything these days it's very good
and it's free so I can recommend that
pretty well it is is very good software
see when is my threader for APU coming
I'm gonna say probably not soon okay so
that's the normal chat this is still
freezing I'm gonna I'm gonna just force
to restart on it and drop the frequency
down we're at 5.4 gigahertz now not
really stable but passing tasks kind of
I want to drop that down and and see if
sentiment will pass again or if we need
to override the files like if it got
corrupted or something okay super chats
we got $10 our card $10 thank you i game
on 1440p 60 gigahertz that's that's a
really high frame rate i plan to upgrade
to 144 gigahertz i'm thinking rise in
2700 X or 9900 K you might need like a
ninety nine thousand nine hundred and
nineteen K or something you're doing 144
gigahertz streaming so in all stages is
144 Hertz versus 60 at 1440 I don't like
/ or I like overclocking they say I
don't plan to upgrade for another five
years
what do you recommend
if 144 is what you really want to do and
you like overclocking I would say the
9900 K if price is no object keep in
mind that your GPU at 144 you're asking
a lot of both the GPU and the CPU so I
don't know what GPU you have make sure
it's well balanced if this is a scenario
where you already have a really good GPU
and you just need the CPU and you have
the money the ninety-nine hundred K will
do what you want I have no problem
saying that's that would be my pick for
that for your requirements if you don't
have a video card and you have a budget
of an amount we're buying the nine
hundred K would pull away $200 or more
from your video card purchase then I
would say get the lower end CPU and
spend more on the video card if you're
pushing 1440p but there is a there is a
disparity at 1440p between the 99
hundred K on the 2700 X this time we
showed that in our review so I'm gonna
drop this back to five point three
because I know that past and events
we're gonna see if it is corrupted or
not and then we'll do I really want to
do uncor I was just waiting for the all
core to stop working so under coarse
kind of soon there's no point in buying
anything until seven nanometers out that
is an extreme in their home video of
Technology I mean look like first of all
seven nanometer not all process is
created equal
so global foundry seven as close to
Intel's 10 secondly if Intel can ever
make ten secondly there are plenty of
reasons to buy before seven an you like
if you need a computer for example
because you don't have one that's a good
reason to buy instead of waiting and it
for who knows what price at what time
the way I look at it is if you're happy
now and you don't need an upgrade and it
does what you want then don't buy and
that respects waiting does make sense if
you need a computer just build one I
mean once you've got the money together
and you've done the research at some
point waiting is only going to
set you back especially if you use your
computer for work or something where you
can make money with that computer then
you should just build it sooner and get
that going 20:27 sort work so it wasn't
stable so it's not corrupted it just
wasn't stable that's good I need to get
through some oh we got a $10 from PC
world $10 oh hey look we're streaming
watching watching the stream please turn
in stee they just want me to give them
$9 like I did for Linus I think it was
actually 15 I gave - $15 Troxy in the
stream is Gordon Bond nice he does have
him Gordon has hang on hang on we're
gonna do this okay I don't know if Adam
is keeping tabs on these we're gonna
we're gonna infinity stream list this is
why the tech community is awesome all
right turn that around can you see that
okay
so we are streaming watching Gordon
watching our stream watching - a stream
how how deep does the rabbit hole go
Gordon we're gonna wait we're gonna wait
until his catches up to here and I want
to try and keep it I have to court him
let's see if he has a reaction right I'm
I'm with the camera now I'm watching it
so this if you don't know who that is
that's Gordon and Elena from PC world
and we did a really fun interview with
Gordon here nice this is pretty awesome
so he did a really fun interview with
Gordon where I was on his channel you
should check it out it's on their PC
world YouTube page I think it's their
main video right now
talking about the 900k before it came
out I wish I can hear what he's saying
I was to go back and watch this later
all right we'll keep an eye on that or
another huh
another benchmark you're taking the
fantex case away all right we need to
film the intro and outro still but if
you get it ready to pack I'll do the
I'll do that after the stream and then I
can finish packing it ok
so haha yeah they were there there
they're fun people at PC worlds we
appreciate their content okay so a whole
lot of YouTube community is all wah
everyone's watching each other right now
alright 2287 was our score and that's on
five point three is that compared to our
previous five point three yes twenty -
ninety-two previously so I think it's
time to we try and stabilize five point
four because it did kind of work try and
stabilize that we have a little bit of
thermal Headroom maybe like 15 degrees
to spare and we try and state get that
going for five point four and then I
need to do uncor finally and then we'll
see how it goes
Stream esepcially how do you like that
thick new die
it is pretty damn thick comparatively to
the previous ones and that's why when we
did all that 8086 benchmarking thermally
versus this one I was so happy with that
idea and deal it at it and saw that the
dyes are different I knew they were
different sizes but different
thicknesses too so it's not a perfect
comparison that's why we ended up doing
deal it with they're all paste but
backwards sure people I didn't tell her
like I don't get it they've they've been
complaining about solder for like three
years and then they put their own face
on it
why super chats what's what's up ins in
these so five dollars from Eric thanks
for doing streaming tests and your
reviews does resolution affect CPU usage
when streaming or just moving past 1080p
only stratum or GPU primarily the GPU
for the streamer side as in the player
for the viewer side that's a good
question I would imagine that it should
strain the CPU if you're doing CPU
encoding and you're encoding more pixels
that's my that's my intuition on that
but I have not tested that I have tested
different bit rates and that impacts the
CPU load a bit so I would say it is it
is reasonable to expect that resolution
would as well but I don't know if it's
linear
now I haven't tested it sir I'm sorry
one more time though we don't want 4
volts very bad let's see one point we
were at one point for two which is in
reality like one point four after droop
let's try one point four three five
let's try one point four four three five
see if that's stable this time and
Cinebench and if not then we will move
on and do uncor overclocking alex west
five dollars using liquid metal to
soften the stem should work with a bunch
of OS the indium and the liquid metal
should bond with the indium and the
solder and soften it might be worth of
video I don't know if Rowan did that in
his but that would mean I mean that
sounds reasonable
I'm not a materials engineer he is
like I said I just used a knife but that
sounds smarter I have not tried it I
can't endorse it but it is something
worth trying it for sure if we do
another one or if there's some sorry I
left on this one but I think it got it
all being that I used a knife and then
sandpaper it's pretty effective okay so
I Cosmo five dollars how often do you
condition your hair I use their own face
every morning before going into the
office
let's try to use like 12 watt per meter
Kelvin paste for that purpose okay so
that that's not stable clearly we try
more voltage but we're gonna hit up
we're gonna hit a temperature limitation
pretty soon so I think I really want
five point four though
let's try one let's see if see if we can
do it
I like 1.45 and if that's no good which
1.45 is really more like 1.4 with droop
and everything let's try that
Travis would $5 what is your opinion on
how easy 370 maximus hero X would handle
the 9900 k answer that question and the
answer was I took a note on it and I
will look into it because a couple of
you were asking Michael Creech $20 I've
been wanting the decals for a while and
I just saw you have them please make a
black mouse pad and maybe a couple
different sizes yes to both we have
submitted our designs for a black
version so it's a black and blue version
of this mousepad this when I was a
liquid metal on it
uh-hum up in the top it's got a liquid
metal stain from earlier so this is a
black and/or I'm sorry blue and white
mouse pad on store that game is X it's
net and a lot of you have asked for
black where the white is this is a
pretty popular design but there's a lot
of demand for the black and blue and I
totally get that so we submitted designs
and we should get those in I don't know
sometime in the next month for sampling
probably and then we'll put them on the
store once we do is it going to survive
I need to check Gordon stream again in a
second we also need to keep a wary eye
out for nope
Lucas paints what I was gonna say
temperatures temperatures are irrelevant
if it's only on for five seconds okay so
let's give up on 5.4 I think if I gotta
put that thing in a ice bucket I could
do 5.4
Chad says I want that mousepad you want
throwing with liquid metal on it because
it's worth more because it's probably
got like $10 of liquid metal on it okay
so are the F's for the system crashing
yes okay k never know if it's for the
stream go ahead to see it's only for the
system so that was at 5.4 it's it's
almost there I can hold it in Thai spy
can't get it incentive ang I think I
could do it with more voltage but I want
I want a a childen radiator probably for
that we're not going to be a Wonderbolt
don't worry 53 is what we're at okay I
think I was out like 1.4 or something
maybe 1.4 - let's just type in 1.4 - and
cash ratio time so we're at 53 just type
in 47 for now and see how that does do
you RAM - probably some work in a bit
let's give that a shot ice cube and the
reservoir someone says the mouse pad has
Steve's DNA on it
grow your own hardware Jesus I'm
flattered that you think my DNA is
comprised of gallon Stan compounds it's
PC world still watching I don't know
that's a doubt it let's Jack Linus is
still talking history him but it looks
like just about the news PC world is
still talking our BIOS is on there
stream right now let's see if Gordon
notices I hit a button it'll go away
eventually
now no I don't want night mode okay
let's see if Gordon notices that we're
pointing at his stream again how do I
get this to go away okay
all right let's this is a this is a wild
Gordon Mon in his natural environment
which we're streaming their chat
streaming our chat oh they're chats
telling that they're chad is telling
them that we're we're doing it so that's
a PC world stream hang on what can i I
need a I need a pen I need to send a
message to Gordon the archaic massive
methods sharp II don't work and I need a
sticky note okay we're gonna send a
message to Gordon because I'm not sure
if he can hear us
see see see what they think
let's see how about this one
here and fix our be s OD okay you zoomed
in on that enough that they can read it
hey that reaction was pretty good it's
about what I was going for it's probably
a lot of gamma laws here sorry for that
I'll the chance to check in with Gordon
see you guys later open invite by the
way Gordon if you if you can hear us
there's Adam producer I have to wait for
the other note to go up on the screen
and then we can go back over is it up
there already no no there it is
[Laughter]
all right okay so Windows booted in
that's hi it did manage to get open all
I've done is changed
I swear at five point three this is
where I'm really curious to see what's
gonna happen because we're at five point
three but I've increased the uncor to
forty seven which is a pretty big job so
will you keep an eye on that and as I
noted before one of the best ways to
support us during these streams is to
pick something up on the merch store you
can go to store that gamers axis
starting at our new limited edition oh
there they open something big Thanks
neat I don't know I didn't say need
grains
big thanks need cratons what does that
mean I had him
okay
hey let's survive so here's where we can
get some cool data 23:07 is what that
says and our previous 5.3 score was 22
92 let's run it again for a sake of
variance so we might get a bit of a
boost here I think x y will be more
sensitive to it and and we'll see how
much that uncor really matters in these
different scenarios so like I said
anyway stored okay vertex is done at
we've got the new limited edition foil
graph logo shirt this one here it's a
quad color foil so you've got there if
you don't know the story behind this
design by the way the color is on the
bars it matches our graph so go look at
one of our graphs like an art review
from today and you'll see the it's
average one percent point one percent
low that was that was Andrews design
idea for the graph logo it's one of our
best designs for the logo I think and
this is a limited edition shirt so once
once they're gone they're gone you sold
out the last one about two weeks I'm
gonna try and shout out orders for these
while they come in the second round is
20 to 15 so let's call 23 10 something
like that 23 11 soaring there and that
is five point three this time five point
three G all core with a 47 X uncor and
that is 23 15 NT okay cool let's do a
single-threaded and this is where we can
learn a bit about the single thread
performance if it cares about that cash
ratio or not then we're going to push
cash ratio some more they check on the
chat chat says andrew is a great
cameraman and then they also say shill
ception so
never change his the shirt ray-traced I
mean yes is this real life there are
arrays bouncing off of it how how much
of your life do you want to have lived
without it not have been Ben ray traced
I believe is what the famous philosopher
Thomas hardware calm said super Jets all
right so like I said we run on a bit of
delay on these but I do try I do get to
them all by the end of the stream for
sure
single slam and $5 I just wanted to give
dollars to because Jian rocks and
Patrick builds great bridges yes that is
in reference to our suspension bridge
that's very fast it's very fast fan this
you can shoot like a hair commercial
here so this is our suspension bridge
with the a couple of twists eyes holding
up a 540 radiator a topping ek supremacy
despite the insulation here it is not
chilled that is from the previous one
and maybe later we'll do that
okay so got another one from David $2
tell Andrew he's a good cameraman and 3d
designer okay Andrew is aware of this
kevin Daughtery Daughtery
$2 great vlog okay thank you appreciate
the two bucks come answer Sam how's it
going Sam five dollars can you do a PBA
auto oh is he testing with B CLK on a
2700 X and a s use X for sony board I'd
like to see the performance in games etc
since it can yield crazy clocks I will
talk to you builds write about that and
see what his thoughts are because he is
definitely an expert in that in in AMD
overclocking and he has studied it more
than I have I kind of start and stop
with the review is we should do it and
the Oh Steve I've seen some time but I
need to I need to look into it a bit
more like I know enough to get the
chorus to four points you gigahertz all
core if like 2700 X that's not a problem
but beyond that I haven't looked into
really any of the special tweaking
memory we've done some of that
Joseph ten dollars how badly would you
expect X 2 e five to be five 2687 wv2 is
to compete with a 1950 X same clocks 16
core 32 threads Ivy Bridge is pretty old
I would suspect they would not hold up
to great in multi-threaded I don't know
I don't know I don't know what the cache
is on those chips I've never paid
attention to the Xeon CPUs but my
suspicion would be that the 1950 X would
hold the lead at the same clocks in in
some applications but maybe not in
gaming I don't know I'm not familiar
with the Xeon sorry Michael Jane's ten
dollars you need to let those rad fans
blow your luxurious hair while we've
already walked by them quite a few times
there was a what cpu are you using one I
have to go find that one what CPU of
course unfortunately searching for that
finds a whole lot of results so 234 cv
marks for our single thread
and that is with a 47 X uncor and 5.3 G
all core so comparatively our previous
5.3 was to the radio it's within
reasonable error it's basically no
difference for this application let's so
it's 2 times 5 that's 2 times pi next we
can bump that that encore up for that
cash ratio is what I should say times by
physics only I will look at temperatures
in a bit and then try some more Marc
Lamont $10 would you expect the same
performance using a 9900 K on his e3
Sony Board opposed to the new z3 90
boards wondering if I'd need a new board
if I decided to upgrade so again the
board you're talking about the max was
10 I've taken a note people are
interested in it we can compare I would
suspect that stock performance should be
the same weird MCE quirks
notwithstanding in other words if you
control it to like all the same BIOS
settings and everything I would expect
there would be the same performance
overclocking performance there's
probably gonna be some differences
because the good z 390 boards do have
new power delivery circuitry so those
will carry those with a really high
overclock better than 312 387 certainly
lower than our previous high but 12 3 8
7 4 times pi as opposed to 12 4 19 at
5.3 and 12 521 for 5.4 all right let's
let's bend the temperatures for now and
just look at some other OC options
see what my options are and biased
beyond what we've done so far - is
talking chit again someone says oh thank
you
zeg thank you for pointing that out
older Zeon's are locked and overclocking
yes they had forgotten since the 3175 is
actually unlocked my degree see can you
shave off by laughing we'll be talking
about that coming up soon well in one of
our content pieces camera sucks
why you don't stream Ian andis capture
card so thank you for your really kind
message it's always a good way to get an
answer is is to be very non accusatory
and not be a jerk so you've done well
there we don't use a capture card to
answer your seemingly rhetorical
question because when it blue screens as
this has done several times the couch
cards drop out I know that epeak makes
one I talked them recently that should
survive those crashes but that would I
haven't tested it and the couch cards we
have don't survive those BSOD is very
well so it's just easier to do this and
not stop the stream every time we have
to like plug in an HDMI cable to kick it
into gear again alright
any info on x5 99 not beyond what we saw
at the Intel New York event I got some
photos there but that's kind of it we
didn't really talk about them though so
that'd probably be worth bringing up
again
okay let's try 50 seemingly this has
been fairly stable memory actually let's
do one thing at a time let's make sure
that stable and then play around with
memory Steve what is your goal with this
OC I just want to see how far it'll go
let's see what's a good target so we're
at 23 15 multi-threaded I would like to
hit I think I'd like to hit 2400 plus in
Cinebench and I'd like to maintain
12,500 and times by but that 5.4 g1
didn't count because it was unstable
have we reached steady state no because
it's constantly rebooting so the
temperatures are never steady-state
all right so let's do this with a 50
cash ratio see if it survives and I'm
gonna check on store order so like I
said great way to support us during the
streams is from the store orders I'm
gonna try and shout some of them out
while we're streaming on store dock
gamers Nexus net we have the new limited
edition foil shirts in we've also got
the mod mats in but we're running out of
this round and then they'll be on
backorder again for another month and a
half while we get them shipped
for the next round so we're running
pretty low on inventory on mod mats for
this round four first one here so Chad
from st. cloud picked up a limited
edition foil shirt Thank You jad got one
from our Toro from Washington picked up
the blue print shirt and some decals
Thank You Arturo we have one from
Stephen and Australia picked up a
limited edition foil shirt so a lot a
lot of Stephens in Australia buying the
foil shirt today I got one from Shaun in
the u.s. New York picked up the blue
print shirt and the cobalt blue tear
down beer glasses with the gold rim on
them thank you for that for those orders
and for the support so we got 23:08 not
really a change I think we need to do
some some memory timings and speed so
this is five point three gigahertz all
core 50x
cash ratio okay
let's let's see what a memory bump will
give us I know this memory does 4,000
megahertz on our ex $2.99 platform I
have not tried it on this one so for
sure the memory can do it just kind of a
question of what is the IMC bin for on
the CPU and what is the motherboard
capable of and we'll find out this
system is like pretty slow to reboot
right now so I'm just gonna push the
4000 megahertz and leave the timings
alone for now and see if that will hold
so I know the memory and everything else
can take it I just don't know if the IMC
can and then that'll be a good way to
bump up our scores especially in times
pi so okay let's do D Ram timing control
I believe is where a soos buries a lot
of their stuff so with Auto it's at 1636
whatever what are other sayings so if
you've been kind of tuning in and out
other settings we turned off MCE of
course we have SPID off it's not it's in
a different menu though AVX offset is
off CB correggio's currently pretty
stable at 5.3 and kind of working at 5.4
and times by only and nothing else
we have disabled this PID as I said
we've maxed out all the current limits
we have the cash ratio now at 50 and
voltage is typed in as 1.42 but there's
a lot of droop so it's more like 1.38
and let's just go ahead and bump up that
memory frequency to 4,000
and then go for let's see the RAM
voltage not for keep typing that in 1.8
1.65 something like that was doing point
65 first 1.8 should be fine
I don't know if we're gonna have to bump
up sa or something okay are you gonna
use liquid helium no not today
we do have an Ellen to pot somewhere
which will be used for dry ice in our
next trip J stream just been waiting to
survive the 2070 and the 9900 K launches
first okay those fans in the background
are loud yes this is an overclocking
live stream they're very loud I'm sorry
I wish I could do something about it
it was pretty quiet when we were doing
the ice bucket though so if for no other
reason then yes the the fact that
they're loud and obviously we do
apologize where we can't do anything
about it if you want to see overclocking
if for no other reason than silencing
the hosts ice buckets a good idea
so it's 4000 megahertz with one point
six five volts the dam gonna be doable
here Steve what is the best way to
measure components with an IR
temperature gun captain tape question
mark your biggest concern is the same as
thermal imaging so your concern with any
kind of thermography or just an IR gun
is going to be emissivity and reflect
reflectivity so if you pointed at like
an aluminum plate like a shiny aluminum
heatsink you're more likely going to
read the reflected temperature than the
heat sink temperature and also it's the
heat sink temperature not the component
temperatures it doesn't matter that much
it should be hot after all
so same concerns as with any like
thermal imaging devices so the best way
to do it is if you have to use an IR gun
and you can't use thermocouples where
you just throw it directly then you want
to expose the component so you'd remove
the heat
ideally and take a shot at a blackbody
surface so like a matte black surface
this is gonna give you the best
measurement if you're working with
something where you can't get a matte
surface and you always have just a
reflective object you're dealing with
like a heat sink that is reflective you
get a like a circular sticker on it like
a matte sticker and stick that to it
it's not gonna be perfect but if you
allow it to reach steady state it'll be
pretty damn close and you can use that
to spot check it I would really advise
using thermocouples instead and
sandwiching them like the really thin
ones that are 1/100 of an inch thick
like the the Li literally laser thin
ones sandwiched on between the Viren
component and the heatsink scorer 2286
is that lower I think that might be a
dip down reflective like the Jeon shirt
yes this would probably not this reflect
the room temperature if you were to take
a measurement of it so that score is
lower and I'm gonna rerun it just in
case there's some variants going on okay
you got a store purchase thank you this
one is from Jackson in Washington who
picked up the Raglan two-tone hoody that
we have the blue black hoody and some
beer glasses thank you then we got super
chance to go through here so we had
Rolling Rock $5 how did you obtain your
encyclopedic knowledge of hardware I
really don't have that do you have an
engineering degree are you self-taught
or mix of both I just experienced just
working with all the stuff so first you
have to know that you're never gonna
know everything about computer hardware
because it's insanely complicated and
once you realize that you can focus on
the areas that matter the most to you
and try to make the most sense of those
so X has to people like their Bauer and
like engineers at different companies we
work with helps a lot I have read a
couple of of hardware
nearing level books but most of the
stuff I know is just comes from
experience exposure to working with it
hands-on mostly and and then access to
engineers and people like that
sergeant's $85 Estella Patrick he is the
best case reviewer and bridge builder
here that Patrick he says thank you clay
otteri $10 Steve Roman focuses on temps
on the night I heard KD lid down about
nine degrees Celsius stock to D lid ten
minutes in Prime 9595 run prime95 run
okay yeah I mean that's
I saw those results before he published
them so yes it did look good if you feel
like D living I still don't think it's
really something I would encourage most
people do this generation because their
real pain it's not terrible like it's
not hard just takes more work than
previously
Dixon software $10 Ice Cube and res not
this time we could do that if there's
enough demand for it we'll do it at the
very end of the stream if I see enough
demand in chat I'll do it Barton Martin
Bart Todd sure with $4.99 say hey Joel
game tonight question mark keep up the
good work Steve but why not have these
79 ad acts in 9900 K review benchmark
charts we didn't run it was in the other
system for the ribcage stuff
darzee five dollars I have forty seven
ninety nine eighty graphics is okay is
it time to get ninety nine hundred K and
a twenty ATT I will I notice a
difference in my web development and not
just gaming or wait two more years I
don't I don't know it says dude GPUs
effect web development
I wouldn't expect they would I would
think most of that's I haven't any web
development in years but it was never
GPU limited in any way so I would not
factor that in unless you're aware of
some need that I am not in which case
ignore what I'm saying and research hit
because to my knowledge GP is not a huge
impact or of things you would do for web
development but maybe I don't know
something that you do not if you're
doing like 3d animations renders then
yeah it would matter ninety nine hundred
K same answer same answer I don't think
it's really that if you're doing
something that's like way more intensive
than
I'm aware of then I would have to point
you to someone specialized in
benchmarking that stuff which bowen to
this is this goes back to the person
who's asking how I know stuff and when I
said you have to first admit that you
don't know everything about computer
hardware because there's too much snow
and it's okay to tell people go read
someone else like an attack might have
some information on that with their
octane benchmarks or something I don't
know which one to X why not test beetle
Adventure Racing on Halloween why is
that a thing
22:43 this run so 23:43 i'm gonna take a
note of that so yeah it's a bit better i
would still like to hit 2400 we should
run times by and see if that has changed
at all we've done is increased the
frequency we haven't tightened the
timings we're gonna do that next we're
gonna go down to CL 15 next and that'll
bump us a lot enticed by but let's get a
baseline at 4000 mega hertz first
assuming it will open
come on three mark you can do it there
you go
okay time spy physics run let's see what
that is with 4,000 megahertz so this is
n T and now we are at 4000 mega Hertz on
the RAM so we're up from 3,600
originally we got a store purchase thank
you for those like said I'm not going to
get all of them but I'm going to try and
get them as they come in and spot check
them due to volume can't always get them
all
Austin vote from Boulder picked up a
limited edition foil graph logo shirt
Thank You Austin very much appreciated
we hope you enjoy it you and everyone
else finds an idea I'm on the first to
take a shot at it and we do typically
sell out of shirts in general pretty
quickly it's just we're not gonna
restock this one Chris from Texas picked
up a mod Matt thank you Chris
we have one from that's just finished
Ian and Bozeman picked up the limited
edition graph shirt you read one more
and then Andrew from from Baton Rouge
picked up a limited edition shirt as
well ok so we're at 12,000 635 what'd I
say I wanted 12,500 sustained so we we
got that we hit that mark well past that
mark on the CPU score now that's good
we're hitting we're achieving our goals
start achieving the the Cinebench goals
next 12000 635 beats the goal a bit and
actually we can push that a lot higher
so let's do that
and Cinebench I want to hit 2400 MT
without going further on the core
overclock because we were going to
become thermally constrained so let's
get this back in do some D Ram timings
Gordon's not still alive is he no they
are still alive
are they playing they're playing a J
video next to our video while they're
streaming nice
I still think what is what what is a
yeah I'm gonna look here's what i'ma do
this might not work I don't look at
Gordon's chat and ask what what is
Gordon and what are Gordon and Elena and
Adam talking about in their stream cuz I
I can't hear them so I don't look at his
chat
they all look at ours after that I don't
see which group wise to me more assume
assuming Gordon reads or repeats what
I'm saying than his okay so that's
stable DRAM and I'm gonna look over
there in a second
so in our chat they're saying nitrogen
that's its direct quote that's what I
was greeted with when I checked our chat
nitrogen just listing off elements I
guess Gordon Elena there are PC world so
they're streaming right now on PC world
stream and there they have our stream on
their screen while they're streaming 15
15 28 actually
31 and then we're gonna need to work on
these to refresh interval 30 2007 67 is
that the max probably is nope goes up
higher this time what's the max on this
65,000 there we go refresh interval so
our efi you want hi and RFC you want low
it's cuz you want to retain the data in
memory as long as you can for benchmarks
and then RFC is the refresh cycle time
and that wow that was super high holy
crap let's bring that down that should
be way lower than it's at 700 Auto it's
so high let's start there see what to
see if that even boots I might need more
voltage on there does PC world ever talk
about pcs yes it sounded like it crashed
but we're gonna let it try and reboot
itself it might cycle times a bit that's
gonna that's gonna cycle for sure
anymore a voltage in there - all right
do you RAM at 4,000 that is correct yes
we're there chat say so there chat says
hi Steve and are they answering my
question this is cycling right now this
is trying to do memory training we're
gonna let it do it see we see if it
kicks in oh yeah it's oh do they not
have super chat on that's unfortunate
turn super chat on Gordon I want to give
you money so that didn't work as a 390 I
think behaves a bit differently for max
- 99 let the memory bump that later
okay let's start here let's start with
just that y is zero cattle there we go
let's see if fifteen holds for sure that
holds on our X 299 with the same kid so
all right 300 is not too low on X 299 it
like it holds on this kit but it might
be on this platform or with this I'm see
you're definitely right although I do
suspect I do question your intentions
when you say 302 low a try it for 20 I
have to question that's the question
your addendums there what cpu is it 99 I
heard K New Age culture $5 I'll wait for
the night I heard k2 come back in stock
yeah we'll see when it when it ships
Alex $5 would you guys be willing to
review and compare the live gamer 4k
capture card internal and external I
would love to see these reviewed no
current plans - we have worked we
reviewed that Elgato on that was kind of
interesting with the heatsink on it that
wasn't actually connected to anything
that was a fun one review it did okay
just weird design very weird
I saw one yes
okay Jordan's chat is saying hey Steve
says turn on super chat okay so super
chats then grow again I have a 3770k
running at 4.5 gigahertz I have a strict
1080i how much am i losing performance
wise and how modern the chip do I need
to let it run free so we tested the 1080
Ti I think with a G 45 60 and a couple
of other devices - I think we started to
see throttling around 1066 a white clasp
on the G 45 60 but to answer your
question you can look at our results
from that review here's a good good way
to do it actually go back to our
previous CPE reviews we use the 1080 TI
pretty similar to yours
so if you go back to our 2700 extra
here's the most recent with our old
methodology look at our 2700 x review
numbers 4i we might have a 37 70 in
there if we don't we have really similar
ones like maybe a 47 90 something like
that look at those numbers or find an
end all CPU at 4.5 gigahertz because if
we're honest the the IPC hasn't changed
all that much
so look at one of those numbers from our
2200 X review it uses a 1080 Ti and then
what you do you look at that number and
then you look at the number for the
highest ncb we tested for that benchmark
and the Delta illustrates where you your
potential maximum the headroom if your
GPU will permit it to go that high but
that will be CPU bound because it's a CP
review so the best way to use a review
it's a bit of work on the user's end but
you look at those numbers like I just
said to figure out where's your maximum
potential CPU side and then you go look
at one of our GP reviews and you can
look at the maximum potential in similar
games for different GPUs and hopefully
the two sets of data together will help
you come to a conclusion as to how
limited you are the 3770k is going to
limit
the 1080i abit yes there are very good
CPUs out there these days so you've got
upgrade options if you really want it
but the question I would ask again is do
you feel like you're actually limited or
do you just want to spend money to
upgrade both are valid I guess but it's
being aware of why you might want to
upgrade it is helpful so this is not
happy with 15 which is unfortunate
because it's no problem on the other
platform and I'm not we might need to
bump like si or something - okay let's
try that all right so we got a super
chat from crack on PC on cotton 25
thoughts on soldering quality between
Andy and Intel that's really hard to
compare because we can't do a
like-for-like so I don't know I
genuinely don't know yeah my Roman has
deleted both I haven't dealer today and
the soldered CPUs so you might want to
check with him $10 from keratin noctua D
15 with 9900 K yea or nay seems fine to
me that that would I mean yeah that's a
big cooler magnitude de max $2 love
watching Holly and me pick between t r2
and 9900 K we haven't done the didn't
DTR to you for these benchmarks not
really gaming oriented so but hopefully
hopefully find what you need pick me
tween out in Charles John $5 just change
my radiator airflow to push instead of
pull and drops four degrees Celsius
facepalm thanks for the stream alright
that's that's pretty cool to drop for
see that easily it depends of course
entirely on your fans it depends on your
case setup so that's not gonna work for
everyone out there but
I do prefer push when I was part I need
to probably consult with build Zoey
because I am more familiar with X 299
overclocking at this point then with
actors III 9 years II 370 even as far as
memory goes so I'm not sure where kind
of my limits should be for some of these
voltages what do we do for our 8086 k
overclock what did we do then be 6k
gamers and XS we did 5.35 don't matter
what we did for anything else so I was 5
25 that was on to fewer cores though so
we're doing better than that regard we
could do some BC ok stuff I guess we did
have memory tuned decently so we're at
tier ass 28 we were at RFC of 240 we
were at our efi of 165 we had IO and si
to 1.3 with v dim at 1.85 for maximum n
of course so that we don't recommend
that for long term
I don't know how this silicon responds
to like so when does it turn red
okay it's at 1.30 let's just do it who
cares on a and not sure where the
safeties are for this silicon versus
previous but it's review sample and this
is part of the process which board are
you using reusing the Maximus 11 Maximus
11 hero I should say time for the Ice
Cube so on
- barks from we got $10 from I'm Way
behind where did it go okay
found it very work unexpected sensation
$10 great content Thank You P - 32 bucks
hey what CPU is this okay they have it
Jeff average two dollars no masses thank
you kinetic conundrum $5 memory part two
and when memory part two and will it
cover voltages in addition to secondary
times yes it is covering secondary
timings for sure I don't think we're
talking voltages I'm only really versed
in x2 99 memory tuning here kind of
hitting some of my my experience limits
on this off to consult with builds I'd
later
oh you know we were supposed to update
the BIOS for this board - I forgot about
that they count with the BIOS a couple
hours before the stream started and it
improved the memory support go figure
but also improve performance overall so
that is something I should do for the
next one okay let's do kind of out of
ideas
much like lionesses Kirk says about him
there you go refresh cycle is much more
reasonable now it's amazing how Auto
timings work when it retrains a few
times trials from seven so this is let
me just make this point really quickly
when I was talking about memory timings
being kind of all over the place and
impacting results this is one of the
things we were talking about we're going
from 700 to 374 can impact like a time
spy extreme score something really
sensitive to memory by couple percentage
points so so that's a that's a big jump
but anyway we were stable here at 240 on
this memory previously I think with 8080
6k I would see I think I want to apply
that new bios because it does stabilize
a lot of stuff
yes I'm gonna say we do that but maybe
maybe for the next livestream with an
ice bucket or something - I need to
catch up on chats Linus has a dragon now
yes I saw that I saw it yeah we have
some we have some small ones we don't
have a door big enough like Linus we
don't have a he's got like that's
bringing up a door and move everything
around catching up on chat for a second
don't get your hair stuck in the fan yes
there's a very very large fans and a lot
of them on a 540 radiator okay let me
blast through a bunch of these super
chats I really need to catch up on these
let's do that we had drunk food reviews
$10 hasty but what does it mean if you
have an overclock that makes it through
gaming and all the normal benchmarks
stress is just fine but you have the
watchdog error randomly while sitting at
desktop we've had that we have that
recently on our production machine it
can happen randomly seemingly it can
happen with one of the have most
recently for us when we were rendering
something so typically things like
increasing the voltage can help
stabilize their memory memory timings
have been a problem as well that have
triggered that for us but gives the
voltage a bit of a bump see if it goes
away and then play around from their PC
world we read that one key with a good
work Steve thank you very much we're
that ages ago at this point about an
hour behind on these let me get through
all these Jeff Evers $2 can you talk
about pre-order delays thanks yeah so a
couple of you have reported that you
pre-ordered this CPU and the 28 ET is
and you haven't gotten them yet and
that's kind of crazy to me I mean the
900k it makes sense but they should have
at least shipped it today so I don't
know I don't know what there is to talk
about like it's a
I don't know it's here's what I'll talk
about this the problem I have with it is
like the 8700 K where the product
launches and there's enough available
that people can kind of buy it and you
can justify the reviews and the presence
of the reviews and then it just vanishes
for months like it's a paper launch
basically I find those two very annoying
and it's I feel like they're typically
used to steal the Thunder away from a
competitor more so than they are to
actually drive the product to launch and
success
Michael else in Chile $5 G no we're
calling greater than wine show and
lioness eating beef jerky well thank you
we appreciate your opinion Sevilla say
two dollars any info on Amazon pre-order
my 900k hasn't shipped yet no info I'm
sorry I do not know anything about them
about the pre-orders Joey Goodwin $5.00
lovely content I was 60 600 K and have
been looking at the 87 RK or 2700 X and
now a 9700 K I'd love to hear your
opinion I play games and multitask okay
so you've got a 6600 K which I remember
correctly correctly is an i5 and quite
an aging one at this point so you're
looking out in eighty seven hundred
twenty seven hundred X 497 hundred K I'm
gonna say I haven't tested it yet
but I would say pass on the knives I'm a
hurricane let's just let's just do that
now it's an odd part eight cores eight
threads
I would you say you play games and
multitask I don't know what multitask
means to you a lot of people think that
multitasking means they have discord
open and YouTube and they listen to
music and they play a game that's not
really multitasking that's trivial for a
CPU to handle so if you do some more
serious multitasking like maybe you're
using maybe you have a turn-based game
open kind on one monitor and then you
have like giant excel sheets on another
one that are running crunching formulas
or some kind of database management on
one monitor you know some kind of game
on the other if you play EVE Online
that's basically a giant spreadsheet
simulator anyway so stuff like that live
streaming that's the more serious types
of multitasking
where
the thread benefit will matter and in
that regard an ad start my heart K is a
big jump for you from a 6600 K in terms
of gaming performance but a 2700 X
actually a 2700 and then spend an hour
overclocking it if you don't know what
you're doing it should take about an
hour
2700 is what $250 so you save like a
little over 100 bucks and if that money
is better spent to you elsewhere and you
don't have high refresh rate
requirements the 2700 or overclocked X
is the same is sufficient for gaming
without super high refresh requirements
and you still get your multitasking
needs accomplished the 8700 K is a great
chip we can recommend it firmly for
people who need that class of IPC need
that frequency I would say be aware of
your applications and what they prefer
between frequency and threads things
like Adobe Premiere you can throw a lot
of threads at it like with the 790 DX e
but we have better rendering performance
with an IG P and a consumer desktop CPU
so be aware of the applications you use
and what they want so Miccio doe $2 test
the IMC you want to see forty one thirty
three to forty two hundred twelve twelve
twelve one T this memory wall t12
we do need to test the IMC let me check
with builds right on that will do
another stream with a nice bucket or
something - and after I consult with
builds write a bit maybe their Bower and
learn more about what I need to do on
this platform for memory will come back
to it with a bigger stream with crazy or
cooling data file five dollars tell him
nice that was about lioness tell him
nice dinosaur bro it'll trigger him
because of an argument about the dragon
with his wife I think I did catch that
in the stream and talk SEK fifty already
thinking about lapping the chip in a
future video I'm sure you saw Romans no
we're not planning to but I might sand
it a bit because it's got some some I
don't know it's not perfectly smooth
that bothers me so I guess that is kind
of laughing it I don't know we'll see
it'll stick with iodized for now
Rolling Rock $2.00 plus one on time
Linus nice dinosaur man I guess I missed
that one $5.00 rrj vr6 if I decided over
card my 4790k after years of owning it
thank you for the inspiration
glad to hear hope you have fun doing
that the 4790k was a good overclocker
and had that upgraded thermal paste on
the 4770 are you okay five dollars with
the average person with an on delay to
900k and a 240 or 360 cnat number five
gigahertz yes we did 5.2 all core on a
280 CLC Kraken X 62 so yes absolutely
Steve with three e's walton 999 if you
had the bandwidth and budget to live
stream in 4k what setup would you run
also what are you using the stream right
now the problem I have with streaming in
4k is more on what happens for the
viewer like I don't know I think YouTube
actually does process it down to 1080
and there were bit rates I note which
has problems with streaming at too high
of a bit rate but we could stream in 4k
and we do have the bandwidth and we do
have the parts we just don't cuz this
seems to work well and I'm hesitant to
push it if it's unnecessary because I
don't know what happens on the viewer
side what are using a stream that we're
using at 1950 X right now a stream and
OBS $10 Eric Jackson to help with the
LTTE expenses David Connelly $5 I'm very
interested in computer engineering if I
go into it I would get a masters I'd
love to work at Andy Intel or Nvidia
making new products I think this is
referring to earlier when I was talking
about answering that other question I
mean yeah I'll say I'll say this I guess
try to figure out if there's some area
you would like to specialize in if is
computer engineering is a very broad
term it's like we talking electrical are
you talking like electromagnetic signal
integrity engineering or something like
that and the in town on video are
certainly high targets there are lots of
other good company too that you could
start at and I would also say you know I
know I guess go into it with with some
research on what aspects of computer
engineering do you like because I hear
Computer Engineering and it doesn't mean
a whole lot
to me in this industry because it's so
broad of course still very valuable but
uh yeah look do some looking around on
the options there's a lot of really cool
fields within computer engineering here
the black buy five dollars are you going
to read you the PT test the proper
methodology we did our own review and I
would refer you to that I don't need to
redo their testing because we trust our
own GA K T on sixty four seven dollars
if it's crashing but not overheating it
probably needs footage yes I don't not
sure what the point of that comment was
he serves a while ago maybe I missed
something eight zero eight eight one
seven four fifty Deborah got negative
wait what and they're gonna force c4 do
- as I'm like a reduction of four
degrees Celsius on rise and what was
your Delta on risin we didn't deal it
Rison and we'll talk about the Delta
with liquid metal on the nine or K and
an upcoming video town $5 I'm just
trying to get through all the super
chats here we're almost done almost
through all of them I think there's more
coming in but we're getting through them
pretty quickly here where did that one
go there we go
five dollars from town give them that
the 900 kg is now thicker we try to
direct I cool I would love to if I can
get a kit from Roman then yes sweet
cubed five dollars much love from Miami
Steve I wanted to ask do you have a
delayed video an overclocking tutorial
yes we do have delayed videos do you
have 5 XL shirts as well I'm a big dude
lol yes I think we do we should for the
cotton designs of maybe like the
anniversary to the line we might have a
5 X we do try to stock a couple of them
every print when we do so keep an eye
out
Alexander the greatest $5 do you think I
can get stable 5 gigahertz with a 9zx
EXO d2 and msi galaxy through 90 yes
with a 900k I'm assuming yes definitely
that's should be trivial Adam Schumann
senior 5 dollars are ordered and
received my large teardown crystal how
do I make it rotate like yours so on the
on the order page it says
rotate it is a stationary base because
the rotation thing is just for display
on the set it's a separate he we bought
it separately carlos pizarro jr. $20
steve content is great favorite channel
thank you very much Carlos lien lie on a
lion hearts $2 seat 7 heart cavers is 87
ok worth upgrading apparently I need to
do this content we tested the 4790k take
a look at those results take a look at
the 8700 k it's the same kind of idea a
little bit of a difference with the 67
RK but not too much well it's by Matt I
have that same case the dynamic waiting
on my a 9900 K to ship before I builds
very interested to see what fan and
cooling setup you go with your negative
or positive pressure a IO I'm probably
gonna do an open loop for my production
machine just for fun because it's I
don't know I'm gonna need to rebuild the
system in a year anyway to drain the
loop and I'm gonna want replace the CPU
so it seems like it'll be fun to do we
got Remy Andre $10 hello Steve how much
would I have to donate to patreon in
order to pay for a video tutorial on how
to apply liquid metal to a Vegas 64
liquid I will advise that you keep the
money and don't apply liquid metal to
graphics cards it's not worth it it's
ready direct eye contact just put good
paste on there you'll be fine it's a lot
of extra work to do liquid metal there's
some risk involved it's already direct
eye contact it's honestly just really
not worth it one dollar for Matteo thank
you and a message Moodie 13 $49.99 wow
thank you mini I wish I had seen your
video asking for someone to send the
Evolve X before I built mine are you
still planning on testing on I love your
videos and work ethic thank you your no
BS approach much love and good luck
thank you so yes we the review was shot
today we need to do the intro now for
right after the stream and then it'll be
done and we'll go up shortly jack
Reitman ten dollars I think Intel
engineers are on suicide watch today
they told us they wanted solder why
can't we win I'm sure
I'm pretty sure someone at Intel is
probably going why can't we win I think
you're probably right the solder is
definitely a massive improvement so
we're giving them credit their massive
improvement arctic nerd $20 almost is
super chats I enjoyed your chiller
overclock in your last stream what would
happen if you ran the same principle and
freezing temperatures outdoors your name
arctic nerd is very fitting such as in a
place where you get to minus 60 degrees
even submerging into a nice lake so same
idea same exact idea actually yeah I
mean who did it Joker
I think Joker did a video I liked
outside when it was snowing once yes so
GPU boost will increase the frequency as
its as the core temperature decreases so
it will boost higher we observed that in
our testing with the ice bucket if you
do it in negative 60 outside like
negative 60 C or something I'm assuming
you're saying negative 60 F but whatever
if you do it same thing outside it's
same idea it's just I guess ambient
slower so condensation is less for
concern so it probably makes it easier
in that regard yes going to the literal
arctic would make overclocking a lot
easier in that regard Jay I'm $20

firm answer these questions but there
are too many variables so I'll give you
a few answers are you running into
issues we're opening accessing files
saving files is slowing you down because
if you're seeing issues where you're
getting file access delays then an SSD
upgrade is probably where you want to go
if you're spending like 10 minutes
opening a giant project file or
something with a lot of parts in it
inside work if that's not a problem and
you have no access time limitations you
don't feel like storage like the latency
of opening things up saving things are
slowing you down then I guess spend the
budget elsewhere like a CPU because
you'll always get more improvement there
most time you will in this case
jeff gilbert $5 finally found a live
stream shoutout from new zealand
question when are you going to upgrade
your personal PC and what would you
upgrade to I'm not gonna upgrade my
system at home any time soon
it's garbage but it works I'm gonna
build a production system here so what
I'm going to do is pull us 6,800 K does
we're not going to use it again
sorry Nepal 6100 K are in Nepal next 99
deluxe ACS motherboard and whatever Ram
I can find and I think that's probably
call it a day there do some overclocking
put under it open-loop should be a lot
of fun I'm really looking forward to
working with a dynamic case for that
from Leanne Lee swing life away 92 $5.00
random question where did the 10 xx
modded BIOS come from the one that acts
similar to a shunt mod I wish there is
one for the newer Titan XP you can find
them on to overclock dotnet that is a
great resource for finding modded V
bios's with higher power limits cebiche
odo $5 let's see ddr4 4200 the 1211
11:28 220 CR one that's a really
specific request not on this kid of
memory Joe suit and then shout out to
the Gen staff you all do an amazing job
and I speak for the loyal gen fan base
when I say you do awesome work and we
love you thank you very much Joe sitt
and then Brandon and $10 take my money
because Intel clue he doesn't want it
ooh
ouch ah which Intel videos are awesome
thank you very much I think we're almost
through these super chats stop suddenly
super chat try to get through them all
um try to get through them all so we can
close out and we got some store orders
too I should shout one or two of these
out but Andrew from New York purchased
one of the foil Graff logo shirts this
one that I'm wearing today not literally
this one but you get the idea those are
selling through pretty quickly actually
these will probably sell out in a
similar amount of times of the last ones
within two weeks I would suspect next
next Super chat was night center how
tight do you screw down water cooler
pump screws onto the CPU and zft crack
on X 62 not that tight if you tighten
the coolers too much on the socket you
might trip a pressure sensor and it will
fail to boot hand tight is the answer
like just tighten it's a it's a giant
thumb screw just use your fingers to
tighten it until you can't anymore it
should be fine unless you have like
massive finger muscles in which case be
careful I guess they probably have a
torque spec but you just go hand tight
you'll be okay it does not need to be
that tight Punkie zero $10 any
recommendations for open test benches I
love the content yes so we are working
we will be working with soon open bench
table pretty soon they make a good one
it's expensive it's small it's pretty
portable so that's got some upsides the
thermal take Corp III is a good cheap
one for like a hundred bucks and you
could turn it into a test bench by
removing the feet or standing it up if
you want vertical Gordon clarifies a lot
or Steve if you turn up the switching
frequency on the chokes it should help a
lot thank you for the information
I'll talk the builds right about that
and all the other ideas a we're gonna
check one dollar thank you it burns when
Internet Protocol
I have Tyler's I will say I laugh when I
hear someone reads this name out well
worth the five dollars so that is from
it burns when I pee it burns when
Internet Protocol sent that end Thank
You president IP at a geek Koya
five dollars I always do
for your man locks love the channel
thank you James W $5 would it be
acceptable for an NC local it's come
join you for your Friday OC sorry no no
visitors thank you for the donation
though coolest see people are local
maybe we'll do a meet-up someday instead
chef William is $20 I have a 99 heart K
arriving on Wednesday currently running
as III not D 370 godlike would you
bother upgrading the motherboard or
stick with this see how it works first
if you already have it coming in just
see how it goes and if you really don't
like it if it's limiting you then
upgrade but you can probably save some
money - don't pho be argh what's cheap H
heatsink that can cool a 5.0 OC 900k
what was that be quiet one we the dark
rock pro for the dark rock for dark rock
for it's not too expensive if that could
handle it I don't know about 5.0 yeah
that 5.0 it should be able to do that
should be able to do that for sure
Martin $5 thanks for answering
I thought you missed my chat from an
hour ago yes sorry what the size of the
20 X cards do you think we will see a
mini card from ZOTAC they like to make
them maybe a mini 2070 first veeram take
space on the higher end ones Jason
Kristoff we're almost to these super
chests $9.99 hey Steve bought a I'm
going to cut off the super Chad's here
to 10:10 p.m. bought a an X 370 a C's
crosshair six hero 4 first gen rising
planning on upgrading to gentie risin
but keeping this board but keeping the
board is this a good idea yeah that's
fine that's a good board I've no problem
with that thar feve 2 dies any chance
you'll make a collared shirt so there's
a chance no current plans though
d'artagnan steal five dollars will be 9
RK have enough PCIe lanes for dual GPU
setup yeah by 8 by 8 ideal you get a
peel ax chip but most important don't
have that you don't buy it by iSAGEN 2
dollars can you review swift tech drive
x3 ao no current plans I'm not actually
sure what that one is
Dixon Salter please tell Andrew he is an
ice cube in a reservoir and what CPU is
this
you heard him
andrew says haha hehe $4.99 I had a
dream I pitched you my favorite topic
consumers ability to believe their
superhuman being things al are res I can
see 8k it requires size and distance yes
8k is tell me that will matter with very
large screens at certain distances
Jonathan oh nice we're almost to the
bottom of these thank you though for
telling the minute we're gonna end with
Kenton motley jonathan rozelle yeah
$2.00 what's your favorite 27-inch
monitor and why I don't have a favorite
because I just use whatever we have I'm
not a lot of good person for monitors
this one's pretty good
it's a 144 Hertz AC Swann I think it's
old by today's standards what is it
called mg279q so we've liked it it's
reliable I don't know how it seems fine
I don't really have serious monitor
preferences thought fix 1337 thank you
for keeping the leet alive still want to
buy your skull Kenyan water block from
you
moonlight mods contact them they'll make
one for you probably contact moon light
lodge they're the former danger done
guys that way you said skull Canyon not
Hades skull Canyon it's that I don't
even remember what skull Canyon is I was
thinking oh it is yeah I got it right
okay yeah yeah I mean like mods contact
them they made the one that we have
elite truck repairs $10 hey Steve over
1070 TI and 7700 K but I'm still
experiencing some shopping as choppiness
in my gaming I have a cheap gigabyte be
250 M will upgrading the motherboard
help yes yes and maybe the OS while
you're at it just in case
Riley Kier five dollars so I asked a
question last ask Gaea an LLC as
temperature control on skylake non k
6400 OC what is the question so I LLC as
temperature control I think is the
question LLC seven runs up to one point
three eight under load used load line
calibration to hold the voltages steady
at the places you want them to be and
you can undershirt if you're not
overclocking I guess I don't know if
that answers your question
can you explain what artifact it is
yeah if I had I don't we may be demo it
let me see if I can just demo it that'd
be pretty easy if I can get this let's
just set this up to boot it should be
pretty easy to demo so let's just reset
to optimise defaults as so much quieter
and I'm just gonna push the memory
frequency on the video card until it
artifacts artifacting you'll see like a
lot of multicolored flickering like a
lot of purple and red and yellow in time
spy extreme is gt2 that's a really good
way to test it it'll flicker like crazy
because HP I'm intensive they're not H
BAM it's memory intensive excuse me and
so as you push the memory frequency to
places where it is no longer stable
you'll see that artifacting which is
that multicolored flickering sometimes
you'll get like a crosshatch like black
bars shown through sometimes you'll get
a lot of really aggressive flickering of
the colors so it just it doesn't mean
necessarily that there's any physical
damage to the hardware you not to worry
it can indicate physical damage but
typically what it means that you've just
pushed the memory frequency to a point
where it's not stable it's not
necessarily hurting it she's not stable
and that's GPU memory frequency to be
clear I don't know if I I don't have any
video overclocking softer on here you
know what let's let's just open it up
times by extreme artifact in yeah here
we go very this is a really good example
this is from Asian Stevens on YouTube
here's your example so this is a good
example can you see that screen okay it
seems kind of dark I pasted it in chat
I'll paste it in chat this is an example
of artifacting though I'm just gonna
paste that in chat and it is from memory
frequency often being too high so one
side of what is a teardown cube earlier
we have one on the desk here let me just
paste that again
there you go okay
someone talk about no envy link 16 by 16
on the godlike that is correct you'd be
8 by 8 for those asking what's the
teardown cube that's what it is it's the
GN logo with a 3d laser engraved design
in it and it has different components so
you see like screws there's fake BRM
component stuff like that
pretty pretty damn cool that's on our
store store duck earrings X dot net for
the person asking about it so it's got
like PCIe slots and chokes and doctor or
a wallet same thing but MOSFETs all that
stuff in there anyway so yeah the that
answers the artifacting question we have
a couple more I said we'd stop at where
kin motley we're almost there a couple
away Fragger 56 $5 what do you think of
other reviewers maxing out at 5
gigahertz on their 99 arcade samples on
water Intel bending strikes again 5
gigahertz is nothing so if that's the
best Intel can send as golden samples
that's really bad because like it does
5g on one core out of the box if you
can't do a 5 gigahertz all core without
any effort you're doing something wrong
no it should 9900 k's should for sure do
5 I don't know maybe it depends on the
software testing but we did 5.2 no
problem we did 5.3 here today sort of
5.4 but it wasn't stable so at 5
gigahertz is not and that was on an X 62
by the way so 5.3 was on this big cooler
but 5.2 was on a 280 CLC unless you mean
bad binning maybe that was it
Raiden 54 $2 thanks for the streams
thank you for watching
PC world said it was fun but Pizza calls
good luck hitting six kickers we are
definitely not gonna hit six kicks
stanley Rennes $10 hey Steve I have 650
watt PSU and I run a 1080i with 240 a
i/o
GPU cooler
although our GBI can handle is 650 watts
enough for an 8700 K and a 1080 TI yes
if they're not severely overclocked yes
B no salucci $2.00 did you say it send
more super chats no kin motley $20.00
thanks for all your excellent work have
a pizza on me thank you Ken motley there
are four more I am stopping after these
four I said I'd stop with the last one
Frank litter go $2 what tastes better
liquid metal or thrown paste okay
I see how it is I wanted to do a couple
more to be nice I would not advise
tasting either of them especially liquid
metal the guerrillas $10 hey Steve I
have somebody 700k c-27 formula do you
think I should upgrade to a 9900 K or
I'll clear my 1080i to a 23
I wouldn't recommend upgrading to a 28
ETI unless you like absolutely need to
have the best and that's all that
matters to you if you're happy with it
just keep it it's fine 1080i is a good
card there's nothing wrong with still
using that card we would recommend
buying it over most the modern card so
like I said to more Jonathan Rosalia
1050 TI overclocking battle of the
bottom that would be kind of fun
also it'd be very limited very fast
you're like a five-minute stream Ben
Grogan $10 posted this in patreon with a
related link dare to go
wow this wow is finally updating to use
multi core using chunking what black
magic ways besides this are used and how
do they work
I'm not sure I understand the question
how is a world of warcraft wow ii w
wasn't capitalized it threw me off
wow it's finally updating to use multi
core i don't know i don't know anything
about how World of Warcraft is programs
unfortunately anyway so that's over the
super chats thank you like I said one of
the best ways to support us has been
through the store thank you to all of
you who purchased up on the store we
really appreciate it
these will still be there for a little
while once we saw they're gone the new
graph logo foil sure but they stuck
around for about two weeks last time two
and a half
so hopefully it sticks around again but
pick him up early if you definitely want
one because they will sell out and we're
not restocking them as for the
overclocking I got two five point three
so we did five point three pretty stable
and sent a bench in times by we hit our
time spike goal actually beat it by
quite a bit and Cinebench I still have
to go back for that one I need to
consult with build Zoid and maybe Roman
to update my knowledge on overclocking
with this platform because they've
trained to me pretty well as husbands ie
kingpin they've trained me well on X 299
but this is a bit different so I need to
learn the voltages for this one and then
we'll revisit it and maybe a week or so
and talk about putting this thing under
an ice bucket as well or something like
that I don't know well we'll have some
fun with it so stay tuned as always
subscribe for more thank you for
watching and I will see you all next
