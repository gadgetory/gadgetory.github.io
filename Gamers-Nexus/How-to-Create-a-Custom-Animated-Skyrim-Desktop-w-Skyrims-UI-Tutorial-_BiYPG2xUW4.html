sexist on net today we're doing a
tutorial video tutorial on how to create
a skyrim themed desktop it is completely
Skyrim theme that uses the Skyrim UI
actually to navigate your icons so you
can use that left vertical slider to
launch your games via the Skyrim UI and
it is functioning much better on the
Windows desktop than an actual Skyrim so
it's not like you're drinking the wrong
potion by accident and then wines kill
yourself so I'm not bitter but that's
what we're going to do and this is just
what it looks like right now this is the
completed version it uses a couple
applications here's what you're going to
need
you will need rainmeter which is
actually a free application that manages
the quote/unquote UI part of this Skyrim
set and then the background the animated
background is handled by Star docs desk
escapes which is a paid program so you
do not need it it is not required they
have a 30 day free trial then it's 20
bucks or something so you should really
only buy it if you're going to do a lot
of these and if you like showing things
off but it is not required you can just
set the desktop background to a
screenshot of your character if you
would prefer or a nice screen shot of
Skyrim the rest of it though is free so
let's dive into that first you are going
to need these files that I have in my
folder and I have linked every single
one of these in the description below
and I linked up an order of use that way
is very nicely organized and we will
just speed through this so first install
rainmeter because that's the free one
it's the easy one and pretty standard
installation just click through it once
it is installed we're going to launch it
and it will look something like this
this is the standard default background
and then after this we need to download
the Skyrim rainmeter suite Skyrim
desktop plugin which is developed by
actor on I believe of deviantART just
grab that in the description below unzip
it go into these zipped or unzipped
folder and grab test 5 Skyrim suite v2
dot RM skin double click on that it
should automatically open with rainmeter
we need to go enable it right click on
any of these sidebars that's on with
rainmeter and go to rainmeter right
click go to skins test 5 Skyrim v2 and
you can start enabling these so let's
start by enabling the launch
which you can see has hey there middle
mouse click me and set up your
applications now that's where you can
manage your icons we want to enable the
vertical sidebar for that to go on top
of and the horizontal sidebar for the
bottom bottom of the page and you can
enable CPU usage which uses by default
Magica but you can change it to health
or something and it is degrading usage
not increasing usage so it starts full
and then goes down don't get confused by
that
same for memory usage and same for
harddrive usage if you really want to
see how bad you are managing your space
and with all of those activated let's
now go ahead and get this desktop
background in if you are not using the
program the desk escapes program just
set the screen shot otherwise follow me
and install desk escapes launch it and
then when you see we have the current
background and we need to install the
Skyrim background so first go download
that from the link below and once it's
downloaded it should auto open with desk
escapes double click on it you will see
it pop up in there and then all you do
is of course click on it and hit the
apply button just like I did here just
right-click and apply very easy so now
we have an animated sovngarde background
and next all we really have left at this
point is managing that left menu so
middle click on it just like it says you
are presented with an ini file or a txt
file actually just scroll down to the
very bottom of it and we will see app
names app 1 name
hey app 1 path and all kinds of stuff
like that and these are just going to be
a pretty simple let's go ahead and make
the first one link to a desktop icon so
I'm going to make it link to I don't
know why not start path 2 just because
it's right there on my desktop so let's
rename app 1 name to Starcraft 2 I will
right click on my icon go to properties
and then grab that target ID right there
copy it and paste it in a pond path now
you'll see when we click on it it will
launch Starcraft 2 you can do this for
steam for Skyrim for CPU Z for cpuid
whatever everything you can get you just
throw it all right there I think it only
fits up to 10 so pick your 10 favorite
ones go ahead and click through them
you'll see
a launch just like they do on my screen
and now the only thing left really to
change is if you want to change your CPU
usage to a different color or memory
middle click on the widget and just
scroll through and change the color to
whatever you want so we can do like
health or stamina or any of those and
there are of course battery meters and
stuff like that but let's go ahead and
change CPU to health so that will be
underscore health just like that and now
it's red so pretty simple stuff now the
very last thing to do of course is the
mouse cursor you have seen that I have
different pointers here based on what
I'm doing and they are all at Skyrim
themes so I downloaded those also from a
link below grab that and then it's
pretty easy we did this in a video
before just launch control panel go to
mouse click on pointers and then you go
to browse and change each respective
pointer to whatever it's named in the
folder and that is everything there is
nothing left to do so we are completely
done with the Skyrim desktop at this
point enjoy it I will try to do another
one maybe Starcraft I don't know leave
your comments below tell you what kind
of desktop you want I will make it
happen as a small reminder we will be at
PAX East this weekend so I will see you
there if you are there approach anyone
with the GM shirt and say hi and please

any comments at all if you have
questions and subscribe subscribe
