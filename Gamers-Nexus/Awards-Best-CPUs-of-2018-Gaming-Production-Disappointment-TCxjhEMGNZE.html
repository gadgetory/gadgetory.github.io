of the year we're now recapping some of
the best and worst cpu launches for the
year the categories include best overall
value most well-rounded best hobbyist
production CPU best budget gaming most
fun to overclock and biggest
disappointment will be walking through a
year of testing data and reviews as
weary capsule the most memorable
products leading into Black Friday and
holiday sales as always links to the
products are provided below in the
description alongside our article for a
written recap before that this video is
brought to you by the gigabyte am the RX
580 and rx 570 mid-range video cards
gigabytes a RS rx 570 now starts at $150
us on some retailers offering an
affordable gaming solution for high
settings and 1080p these cards now come
with your choice of games picked between
Resident Evil 2 Devil May Cry 5 and the
division 2 you can pick two of three
learn more at the link in the
description below so as a reminder here
data isn't the focus for today we're
recapping coverage so we're pulling
charts from about a year's worth of
testing and reviews here and from those
older pieces need to stop doing that
thank you to the reader who sent in the
sepia fidget spinner from those older
pieces you'll have to keep in mind that
of course Windows updates Hardware
changes things like that impact
performance results so for the most
up-to-date CPU benchmarks you'll want to
check our newest CPU review that's
either going to be the 9600 K or 99 ATX
ear Aviva's going live and that'll have
the most updated numbers for you but
we're still going to start showing some
of the older charts just for perspective
on how things have changed because a
years a really long time in the world of
Microsoft Windows updates where it
updates seemingly every 15 minutes at
this point will also be mailing out GN
award crystals to the companies for
their most important products for the
year that are featured in here so Intel
and AMD will each get one for different
reasons the award crystal is a 3d laser
engraved GN tear down logo with extreme
attention to detail and although the
products have to earn the award you can
buy one for yourself at store gamers
Nexus Net the award for best overall
value goes
AMD's are 526 hundred this year which
receives the award for its new $160
price point and high marks performance
in both gaming and lightweight
production workloads as a reminder it
wasn't long ago that we were buying I
three CPUs in the 6th and 7th gen for
about $160 which were always tough to
justify against the then incumbent Intel
i5 s at around 180 to 200 dollars
although threads are into everything the
higher thread count are 5 2600 and it's
reasonable overclocked frequencies to
establish the product as a lightweight
champion with versatility for gaming and
some production tasks over the past year
we've tested the r5 2600 and streaming
while gaming simultaneously and have
found it to perform it reasonably well
with faster h.264 encoding 'z we've also
tested it for blender workloads where an
overclocked 2600 effectively at 2600 X
except a bit better to 4.2 gigahertz
ranks nearing last generations r7 1700
at stock settings we've tested the CPU
in gaming where it can keep up admirably
shown in several of our charts from at
the recent 9600 K review and will flash
through a few of those on the screen now
in case you've missed our recent
benchmarks the r5 2600 isn't the best
CPU in any one category but it does
manage to achieve genuinely universally
good performance especially at its a new
price in gaming lightweight production
and even in simultaneous at live
streaming and gaming workloads we can
strongly recommend the r5 2600 for a
mid-range gaming PC build where the
budget can't quite stretch to i7 or r7
territory for most users the CPU will be
plenty just like we once said about five
generations ago now that an i-5 is quote
enough for gamers it is now the r5 is
enough for most gamers where the r5 2600
holds a well deserved award for best
overall value the I $9.99 hundred K even
with its somewhat absurd pricing does
deserve to nab the award for most well
rounded to be fair this one is still a
toss-up between the 9900 K and the 8700
K the latter of which received this
award last year to us this category
means one thing this is a CPU that can
play games at the highest frame rates
and with the most
performance but can also execute in
common production applications with top
class performance that would include
Adobe Premiere we're and we saw the 9900
K nearly matching the performance of the
$2,000 99 ATX II it would include
Photoshop for the 99 hundred K
outperformed workstation competition and
that's because they like frequency and
it would include blender where the
overclocked 9900 K managed to complete
frames at about 17 minutes for the
monkeyhead render that put it as on par
with the 7900 X which is an impressive
feat similarly the 9900 K also chart
tops in our gaming benchmarks where it
managed some of the fastest turn
completion times in Civilization six
reducing the wait time between turns by
noticeable margins it held the highest
marks in far cry 5 at 1080p
pushing 163 FPS average at 5.2 gigahertz
and 156 FPS average at stock the 9900 K
further pushed nearly 300 fps both stock
and overclocked in f1 2018 at 1080p
despite its price and despite some of
the controversy around it the 9900 K is
genuinely very well rounded it's a good
performer in all applications tested but
it's also expensive and one would expect
it would do well when it costs as much
as it does we'd like to see this come
down in price still and until the 9900 K
does come down a bit
the 8700 K remains halfway holding on to
this award as it won it last year and
still remains in the price category
where the I $9.99 hundred K probably
should be which is about 350 bucks of
course to see any of these charts in
more detail check our previous reviews
for the best small business and hobbyist
production CPU we're giving it to the r7
2700 this category is for someone who
might be ramping into professional
workloads or who is just starting out as
a small business in the field of content
creation the r7 2700 isn't the best
gaming CPU it does fine but it's not
something you buy for only gaming builds
with ultra high refresh or something
like that it is however an excellent
value option that manages to perform
better in production applications than
its new $250 price tag would lead you to
believe it does well enough in games to
enable gaming on the side while still
maintaining a high performance
production throughput on the
inside of the machine in our blender
2.79 benchmarks we charted the r7 2700
as performing at 8700 k levels when both
were stock completing our monkey head
render in 26 minutes and our Jian logo
render in 32 minutes versus 27 minutes
and 33 minutes for the $80.00 more
expensive 8700 K for tile based
rendering applications like blender the
2700 does exceptionally well
overclocking to 4.2 gigahertz all core
got the 2700 to 23 minutes completion
time for that same monkeyhead render
ranking it as just behind the stock 9900
K which is often over 500 dollars that
level of performance for the price is
nearly unbeatable right now allowing the
2700 to earn its award in this roundup
Rison isn't always the best for
production workloads though just as a
reminder for Adobe applications desktop
class Intel CPUs tend to do better we
Illustrated this recently in Photoshop
where the 99 hundred K outperformed the
99 80 X E and 2990 W X by somewhat
significant margins that's because
Photoshop and premiere which saw similar
performance still favored raw frequency
with a secondary requirement for threads
for someone who is a heavy Photoshop
user you live in Photoshop or maybe
Premiere we would instead lean towards
one of the Intel desktop CPUs as a
recommendation for more cost friendly
hobbyist production capabilities this is
where someone who is making some money
from the work but isn't doing it
full-time just yet for blender like
rendering our Jian logo intro animation
the r7 2700 is a powerful workhorse that
pushes through frames even faster with
an easy overclock allowing it to match
2700 X levels of performance the 2700
also does well and its balance of gaming
capabilities for the occasional session
while still enabling efficient
throughput and thread intensive
applications primarily for the price of
$250 and an easy 30 minute overclocked
session the 2700 can stretch its legs at
a more affordable price point than
competing CPUs have been able to in the
past the next award is for best budget
gaming CPU last year we gave this to the
intel pentium g 45 60 which allowed for
reasonable baseline cv performance at
fifty to eighty dollars depending on the
time of the year that you bought the CPU
to
around 70 though this year the our 320
200g shakes things up a bit by
integrating a reasonable IGP for some
additional gaming horsepower although
it's priced at $100 and therefore more
expensive than our budget CPU category
typically calls for the trick is that
there's no need to buy a GPU it doesn't
get much more budget than a $100
processor that includes both the CPU and
GPU for the system the 2200 G includes a
graphics processor that's strong enough
for eSports style titles like rocket
League overwatch and csgo beyond that
you'll definitely want a dedicated GPU
and CPU because performance of the R 320
200 G suffers hard and other games total
war Warhammer is a great example where
performance plummets to well below the
performance of just about anything else
that said if you're really tight on
budget and want to save money on other
components the R 320 200 G with an
overclock will perform well in the
aforementioned games while allowing cost
savings elsewhere in the build that's
the real secret of this one you can get
a cheaper power supply a cheaper
motherboard and significantly smaller
case that can all be combined with the
2200 G for a low-cost gaming PC the CPU
is also a fun overclocker and not
difficult to push beyond its stock
settings as our previous testing
demonstrated it's good when overclocking
the IGP
and a good match for those lighter load
titles that are burgeoning in popularity
right now although we wanted to include
intel's pentium g series as a good
budget option when coupled with a
discrete GPU all pentium g cpus are
currently at or above $100 given the 14
nanometer shortage which is ridiculous
this sad side-effect means that it can't
make the cut for our list as they
combined a price with a GPU climbs to be
too high to be worth it
ultimately if you can find a 50 to $60
CPU and couple it with a $90 video card
the combination is going to be better
than a single r 320 200 G the R 320 200
G comes in cheap though and can fit in
cases that other setups can't
accommodate the r5 2400 G doesn't make
the list as it's $160 price point isn't
sensible and he'd be far better off with
a discrete GPU and CPU combination and
if you're curious we're working on a 200
GE review soon so subscribe for that
follow up to revive our most fun to
overclock award Intel receives this one
for its
8086 case if you launched this year
these are been to 8700 KS that are
nearly guaranteed to push far higher
frequencies and lower voltages than
their 8700 K counterparts although we
wouldn't recommend an 80 86 K for stock
usage there's really not much point when
considering an 8700 K instead it's
genuinely one of the most fun CPUs we've
worked with for overclocking this year a
quick deal it and some liquid metal
later and we got our first 8086 k sample
up to five point three five gigahertz
with 4000 mega Hertz memory frequencies
on just standard closed-loop liquid
cooling if you have some money to spend
and are more interested in overclocking
as a hobby or sport then in simply
gaming or building the 8086 k offers a
good Avenue to dip into the overclocking
world the fact that Headroom is often
high means that the requirement to learn
overclocking tricks will kick in sooner
posing an excellent learning opportunity
for CPU overclocking although the 8086 K
was officially limited in quantity it's
still available through several online
retailers at around $440 this brings us
all the way around to the biggest
disappointment category last year we
gave us two intel's kb lake x cpus which
were thereafter discontinued for the ax
$2.99 platform this year the biggest
disappointment goes to the Intel I $9.99
ATX II the CPU aims to revamp the 79 80
XE and overclocking favorite of ours
with solder between the IHS and die to
improve thermal transfer
unfortunately the gains can't be
realized as the core to core Delta's
from fan cavity in the IHS are
significant enough that we were able to
overclock much higher on a deleted 79 80
XE in our review of the 99 ATX e we
demonstrated thermal results at the 99
ATX e peaking at 104 for its hottest
cores another chart from our review
showed the highest to lowest core
temperature Delta of being about 40
degrees which means our hottest 5 cores
are limiting every other core in
frequency although the 90 90 DXE
improved the situation over paced for
anyone overclocking this thing it makes
far more sense to buy a 79 80 XE deal it
it and apply liquid metal the thermals
are better and the overclocking Headroom
is substantially improved by going that
route with the previous CPU
ultimately we were able to push these
soldered 99 80 XE to 5 gigahertz but
that was by using this it's a radiator
that can fit 18 140 millimeter fans or 4
200 millimeter fans per side using
something like this yes it overclocked
swell but we can achieve similar clocks
on a 79 AD XE with a liquid metal and a
reasonable radiator that can fit in a
case the 99 d DX e gets credit for
improving baseline stock performance
over the 790 DX e something we
demonstrated in benchmarks like blender
testing the limited OC Headroom limits
its target audience to a small user base
the only real user of the 99 TD XE is
someone who needs both high frequency
and high core count already a small
audience and then further only wants to
use it stock we were greatly
disappointed in the soldering solution
and the limited gains it provided and so
the 99 80 XE firmly earns its spot as
the recipient of this year's biggest
disappointment award and then the final
award here we'll do this one on camera
the final one is the best worst trend
award and the worst trend for this year
the the best of the worst trends goes to
the motherboard manufacturers so it's
not exactly a CPU but it is CPU adjacent
and this one goes to the motherboard
manufacturers for an inability to decide
on following a standardized
specification which is the one defined
by the motherboard mentor the
motherboard manufacturers primary
partner only partner the CPU makers so
this we talked about with Intel but it
happens with AMD to where there are
violations of for example TDP of turbo
durations happens on both and the end
Intel CPUs in a way that makes testing
difficult to standardize because it's so
is something new and sneaky and BIOS
they have to look out for that will
throw off the results from spec from the
stock specification on the CPU maker and
that leads to results that are just you
end up having to to really control a lot
harder than should be and then also
start drawing new conclusions of ok this
is how the product performs on mother
would a is how it performs on the way it
should perform and we end up just with
with a more difficult climate for
newcomers to enter
and try and understand the performance
of different products because they look
at different reviewers who use different
motherboards different testing patterns
and methodologies and the results are
just tremendously different in some
cases and all of this comes down to
motherboard manufacturers to some degree
and that's because they find ways to
skirt the spec and do things like enable
for example a new version of MC e rather
than going all core sync to single core
turbo they are now instead just
bypassing the turbo duration limitations
which is another really good way to
boost performance without being noticed
by most people so anyway that's that's
kind of the annoyance we've had this
year just working with motherboards and
trying to make sure our tests from board
to board remain representative of how
the CPU is sold and marketed rather than
how the mother would want to Reese peso
Phi the CPU to make the board look
better because ultimately that makes the
CPU look better than it should out of
the box and that happened again with
both CPU vendors it's up to the
motherboard makers at this point so that
was the most annoying trend for the year
but anyway as we continue our awards
shows for end of year we will be
recapping of course other devices you
can check out our case recap on the
YouTube channel already or on the
website if you prefer the written
version and keep an eye out for more CPU
benchmarks things like that we have the
200 GE coming up it's pitbull ated but
better to get it live at some point
because it's an interesting processor
