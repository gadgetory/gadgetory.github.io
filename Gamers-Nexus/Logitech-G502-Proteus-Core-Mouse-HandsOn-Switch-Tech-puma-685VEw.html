Nexus Tana and we were here at PAX East
to 2014 at the Logitech booth right now
I'm joined by Chris pate product manager
for gaming mice and we are talking about
the Proteus for mouse that we actually
just posted about hit a link in
description below for the news
announcement today we're looking at the
actual Madison person it's got a couple
new changes can you give us a just an
elevator pitch of what the core features
are sure
so proteus core is really about tuning
tunability right so we want to give
gamers the ability to make the mouse
work for them exactly the way they want
to and we started by developing a sensor
from the ground up that has zero
smoothing has zero pic surrounding is
incredibly fast it cracks it up to 300
inches per second and it has the best
accuracy that we know of in addition we
added a new feature called surface
tuning which allows you to configure the
mouse for the surface that you're on you
can actually just say okay Delta tell
the software tell the mouse okay this is
the pad I'm on and it will reconfigure
itself change the the parameters of the
the sensor so that it gets the optimal
light and reflective behavior off of the
surface that you're using it's able to
be tuned to pretty much whatever service
you want to use on not glass but pretty
close so the Logitech Gaming software is
the is what we use to actually do the
tuning process but the tuning happens
and is stored on the sensor itself
from what I understand doesn't mean
we're capable of moving the mouse from
system to system and retaining the
settings exactly we've got three onboard
memory profiles the onboard memory is
driven by a 32-bit ARM processor and you
can store up to you can store your your
surface tuning you can store multi key
macros you can store up to five dpi
settings the report rate of the mouse
can be stored on the onboard memory so
you can completely configure the product
and then either take it to another
computer or uninstall the software and
it'll just keep working the way you want
it to or use it on a non non Windows OS
and with buttons which are of course
pretty important for a mouse is it 11
buttons we have 11 programmable buttons
two of them are the tilt left and right
on the scroll wheel one of them is just
clicking the scroll wheel but we have 11
programmable controls that you can set
with again the mouse functions or
individual key constructs or multi key
back row so when you plug the mouse in
like most like a lot of gaming mice it
enumerates us both the keyboard and the
mouse so when you're paying back
keystrokes it's actually coming over the
keyboard channel so it looks to the OS
like a keyboard is typing stuff so we
use mechanical switches under every key
the left and right tilt and the scroll
wheel are not micro switches left and
right tilter are very nice
kind of square tax which in the and the
wheel click is a standard metal dome
switch we all change
the G 500 so we've changed it from a
metal wheel with the with the dual mode
scrolling to that has a rubber tire on
it to a full metal wheel in addition
we've improved the ratchet force so that
you can easily more easily feel that the
defense between the different scrolling
positions so it's easier to tell when
you've scrolled from 1 to 3 or whatever
and then in the in a in the hyper patch
mode it still spins you know for in the
marketing tax from the initial press
release it was a key feature that we're
using individual key plates now left
mouse and right mouse right can you
explain for everyone why that's
important sure so with a monolithic key
plate design which is used by a lot of
gaming mice right now it's it's easy to
get into a situation sometimes where
you're you're clicking the buttons in
such a way that the the key plate will
flex or warp which causes it to not
actuate the the switch perpendicular to
the plane of the to the surface it's on
so if you get it coming into this year
you get a less good click feeling and it
has effects on durability as well so we
get a much more perfectly perpendicular
click which feels better which is more
precise and it's with
and you run us through the endurance
packs the the distance and key clicks
sure so we got 20 million clicks on each
of the left and right keys
the feet are PTFE
polytetrafluoroethylene which has a
commercial name that we don't use it's a
it's their they're super slick they're
rated to 250 kilometers of travel the
sides are rubber and not ap so they're
much more durable than then mice have
been in the past you know it's a it's a
it's got a braided cable
you know it's it's a it it's got a three
year warranty and it'll live up to it so
one of the most important features funny
gaming mouse is the sensor this sensor
has been posted as one of the best or
the best that you guys have at least
ever made or worked with can you tell me
why sure so we actually worked really
hard to develop this new sensor from the
ground up with the idea that it was
going to be the most accurate sensor on
the market it has the highest tracking
speed available to market right now so
it goes up to 300 amps inches per second
I it has the ability to track even at
accelerations of up to 40 G's and that's
not acceleration in the sense of the
word that that people believe that a
sensor has acceleration this is the
sensors ability to handle being
accelerated or decelerated is rated at
1440 gravities which is
incredibly it's a lot matching weighing
40 times what you do right now
suck it is it has zero smoothing so we
get a huge dpi range but we do it
without any smoothing and without any
extra calculation so it does go from 200
to 12,000 dpi but we don't compromise on
performance at 12,000 dpi you are just
as accurate and responsive at 12,000 as
you are down to 200 has zero pixel
rounding which is which makes the
tracking or again makes everything is
designer I'm making the tracking more
accurate and more responsive so it's got
a lot of features inside the sensor that
haven't been implemented before in
addition to the surface shooting region
very cool so MSRP is $79.99 yep $80 I
hit links in the description below for a
full article coverage and it is the
proteus core we'll be reviewing it soon
so do check back for a full review I
always do a teardown of these mice so we
can see what's inside and we will see
you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
