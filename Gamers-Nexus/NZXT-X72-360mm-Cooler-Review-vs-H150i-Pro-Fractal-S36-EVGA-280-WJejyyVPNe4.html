and zxt is made of three hundred sixty
millimeter cooler to join their crackin
family a lot of people have been asking
for this because other companies coarser
even fractal out of nowhere kind of have
been adding three hundred sixty
millimeter coolers to their lineup
it's a popular size it's definitely
getting popular right now and it
complements 280 well for people who
can't fit the width of 140 millimeter
fan so today we're reviewing the kraken
x 72 liquid cooler from NZXT using the
same base products as the X 62 and 52
just with extra length 360 millimeters
so it's got 320 millimeter fans on it
that's what we're looking at today
before that this video is brought to you
by thermal takes view 37 case the vo 37
focuses on highlighting custom PC builds
with its full panoramic window and
tinted front acrylic and our thermal
testing the view 37 performed reasonably
well when considering its looks focused
build which is partly thanks to the
airflow design and the removal of a
bottom power supply shroud for a balance
of looks and performance check the link
in the description below for the view 37
these coolers are pretty straightforward
we previously tore down one of the
Kraken series coolers I think it was an
ex 42 but it's all the same parts so the
pump internally it's an ASA tech pump
it's a gentle and NZXT had a really
heavy hand in designing actually they
custom-made a PCB that ended up going in
there for RGB LED control that's
something that NZXT did before the 6th
generation which is now being used for
the corsair h 100 i pro season 50 i pro
h 115 i pro those have a new RGB LED PCB
in it that AC tax made and they're
offering to all their partners who by 6
generation pumps as a product itself the
sixth generation pump is not better in
any way than the 5th generation problem
the difference is almost literally just
the LEDs there are some changes in hot
spots and some changes and how the
liquid is pumped around the the actual
pump the impeller is definitely better
in 6 gen but as far as cooling
performance
they're roughly the same and six Jen is
even slightly behind in all tests that
we've done and according to all of the
thermal engineers we've spoken with so
in terms of performance fifth and six
Jen not so far apart that means that the
x70 to here which is a $200 cooler that
competes with the H 150 I Pro from
Corsair a $170 cooler both 360
millimeters that means that in terms of
the pump quality alone there's not a big
difference between them the primary
changes are things like Coursera has
specified a slightly smaller cold plate
on their Pro Series and they've also got
the six generation changes which
obviously boil down to LEDs and a better
impeller so ultimately what we're
looking at with these products like
always with something made by a supplier
like gaze attack is the fans it's who
has better fans who has better noise
normalize performance we tested all of
that and price is here just to give you
an idea the X 70 to 200 bucks 3:103 120
millimeter fans it's 360 radiator $200
that X 62 is significantly cheaper $160
EVGA CLC 280 another 280 cooler is
between 120 and 150 depending on the day
the H 150 I Pro 170 flow 360 184 so the
X 72 is definitely at the high end it is
still cheaper than something like an ek
MLC Phoenix which is a semi modular semi
open loop design so kind of riding the
line between entering it's a beginner
open or semi open loop territory which
is a dangerous place to be but if it
works well and you're definitely not
going to expand your loop that's not a
bad product for you so let's get into
this the main test we're doing 100% fans
being 100% pump speed so basically it's
just the flat-out test everything maxed
out how well does it perform with no
constraints whatsoever test after that
hundred percent fan silent pump which is
a preset and cam and then 63 percent fan
speed to get a 40 DB eight and always
normalize test for all the testing
methodology and information the bench we
use all of that click the link in the
description below it'll go to the
article you can read more about it
they're tested at flat-out speeds the
crowd
connects 72 cooler maintains a
steady-state load temperature of 35
degrees Celsius over ambient or there
abouts roughly equivalent to the corsair
h 150 i pro at mac speeds of 1600 RPM
measuring at thirty five point eight
degrees over ambience the difference is
within margin of error the ek Phoenix
360 is an expandable loop with more open
loop tendencies than closed loop
tendencies and benefits from additional
Headroom at higher rpms of 2150 ek
Phoenix does about thirty-two point six
degrees at peak performance using fans
with 150 rpm higher speed and an overall
bigger cooler and block compared more
fairly versus other three hundred sixty
millimeter coolers the crack connects 72
is right around the H 150 I Pro and the
fractal s 36 at 1900 rpm which is about
100 rpm slower than X 72 s fans running
with the X 72 at 100% fan speeds and a
silent pump setting we land at 36 point
four degrees over ambience this marks it
as roughly tied with the H 150 I Pro at
40 DBA and H 100 IV two at max fan RPMs
a significantly louder cooler but one
which performs equivalently when slowing
the X 72 pump noise normalize testing is
done to equal the playing field of the
coolers setting all of them to the same
total system noise level of 40 DBA this
allows us to test overall efficiency and
efficacy of cooler and fan design for
noise normalized cooling performance at
40 DB a total system noise the Krakken x
72 at 63% fan speeds measured at thirty
seven point one degree Celsius over
ambient this plant says right between
the h1 50 I pro 360 cooler and the
fractal s 36 360 cooler these three
numbers are all within margin of error
of one another there is no significant
difference between the coolers within
one degree of each other and the X 62 is
also functionally equivalent
when noise normalized keep in mind that
pump speeds are somewhat variable with a
10% variance plus or minus contributing
to some units unit differences and also
the fan size of these coolers is
different depending on we're looking at
280 or 360 NZXT Zacks 72 performance is
about in line with other high-end
coolers it's outdone at noise normalize
performance by the ek MLC Phoenix 360
but that's a very expensive cooling
solution with a semi open-loop
abilities for noise levels the stock
crackin X 72 with full fan and pump
speeds measures at 50 DBA the same as
the X 52 a 240 cooler with max fan
speeds and also not far from the s 36
63% fan speeds hits 40 DBA for this one
and the silent pump setting doesn't do
much to reduce noise but that's because
we had no issues with this pump making
noise to begin with some of these tech
pumps can be whiny but this particular
unit performed well and did not have any
meaningful pump whine the cooler does
perfectly fine in terms of all the
thermal and noise testing thermally it's
competitive it's not significantly
better or a significantly disadvantaged
than any of the things we tested it
including the ek Phoenix LLC which is a
different class of cooler it's a higher
class of cooler to be frank but it's
more expensive it's expandable and it
carries the whole ek theme of being sort
of open-loop ish before you get into
that really high end open-loop stuff so
that's not a fair comparison but even
when you do compare it to that product
they're not terribly different in terms
of flat-out performance for cooling one
device the CPU that means ultimately
you're left with trying to figure out
why you would buy one cooler over the
other so if they're all the same price
and you're talking about cracking X 62 H
150 I Pro H 115 I Pro H 115 cracking X
72 evj 280 all that stuff you're talking
those coolers it more or less comes down
to pick the one with the noise levels
that you want and the one with the look
that you want
pretty straightforward NZXT focus is
pretty hard on the look they definitely
have the most advanced RGB LED options
in terms of current coolers they're
miles ahead of Corsair still who are
playing catch-up with the
sixth-generation pump and if that's your
thing then NZXT is the way to go but you
still have to ask yourself if you need a
360 versus a 280 because functionally in
terms of performance they're basically
the same take the one that's cheaper
that be the X 62 in this case which is
160 bucks or if you don't care about the
LEDs go even lower
list you have something like an EVGA CLC
280 or the old courser h 159 on pro for
much cheaper than any of these that's if
you're looking at just the performance
angle though they're close enough to be
completely irrelevant and you could save
a bunch of money by going that way
but again if you can't fit it to a tee
or you really want a 360 for one reason
or another it makes your build look
better whatever X 72 is perfectly fine
as a product there's nothing
significantly wrong with it nothing
really wrong with it at all just that
price and wise it's it's up there it's
higher than the flow 360 it's higher
than the H 150 I Pro that it competes
with and as higher than the fractal last
36 and basically everything else it's
lower than the Phoenix I guess but
that's not a big victory so it comes
down to do you want the crackin next 72
specifically and it's RGB LEDs but
performance wise you have absolutely
nothing to worry about you can pick any
of these colors that we just talked
about 70 to 60 to 150 i 115 flow 360 CLC
280 any of them would be perfectly fine
in terms of performance you pick based
on the price and the looks we'll leave
that to you but as a product nothing
wrong with it at all really it's just as
I said price so look into that see what
