Nexus dotnet and today we're talking
about watchdogs this is the official
review I've already spoken about the PC
performance on multiple video cards
we've talked about mouth smoothing we've
talked about crash fixes we've talked
about PC optimization and all these
things happened because watchdogs in
short has been somewhat of a disaster in
terms of its release on the PC as a
platform so that gives you a bit of a
spoiler as to what I think in this
review the review will contain
discussion on a Hardware optimization it
will go into bugs I've experienced me
doing Ubisoft's QA job for them talking
about fundamental design issues
unintuitive
input dooming the game to user
abandonment and then the conclusion so
quite a bit of stuff to go over here
today and it's all stemming from one
single factor and that is that this game
has been hyped to oblivion and back and
it is it's completely unable to achieve
any of the expectations set by that hype
so that is a fault of the industry and
of the consumers but it's not a not
necessarily something we'll dive into
too deeply here in this review so that's
a lot of topics let's start with the
hardware since that is the easiest to
discuss putting it short watchdogs is
the most horribly optimised PC game I
have ever had the misfortune of playing
in recent years titanfall was pretty
damn bad watchdogs is entirely new
levels of bad
it was I achieved all of 53 FPS on
average when using a 780ti in
combination with the 4770k and lots and
lots of RAM that was at a very high
speed and the performance is detrimental
for several reasons first of all Ubisoft
has failed to optimize their game for
computer hardware in general
I'm sure Ronnie friends have more
acceptable on consoles but on PC it is
totally unacceptable to have 53 FPS with
almost maxed settings on a 780ti which
is a $720 video card that has 2880 cords
it's got 5 teraflops of rock compute
power a 3 gigabyte frame buffer I mean
the thin has a memory bandwidth of 336
gigabytes per second so we know we're
capable of filling that frame buffer if
necessary and yet the game performs
horribly on it so why is that well after
some research it looks like a lot of it
is it's really it's twofold one part is
anti-aliasing for some reason
anti-aliasing is a massive hit to
performance and watchdogs more so than
I've seen in every any other game I've
ever been smart and that's an issue on
Ubisoft part failing to optimize it and
probably build anti-aliasing properly
into the game and this is evidenced by
the fact that jumping between MSA a 4x
and TSM a produces almost a 2x FPS
increase whereas dropping from ultra
settings to medium is about a 10 FPS
increase on the 780 Ti so the only
reason we see a big increase on the
780ti when changing settings is when
changing anti-aliasing further when
testing with a 7870 or 270 X or a
similar architecture card those are
that's basically the same video card
with the our series branding I get frame
freezes these are actual freezes several
seconds long we got stuttering we got
frame drops I got frame drops and mic
stuttering that was quite severe when
using SLI and trying to use crossfire
was actually I heard the advisable to
disable both of those use a single GPU
because it was so bad and that's kind of
frustrating as a PC user so this all
happens because of optimization and it
happens regardless of your video card
drivers in fact updating 2:00 a.m. these
new drivers produces about a 10% FPS
improvement and you have to update
because if you don't you're gonna get a
blue screen of death when playing the
game on 14.4 with certain AMD cards so
it's a bit of a mess
I thought the CPU might be the throttle
but changing from a 35 70 K to a 4770k
saw almost no improvement in performance
that was noteworthy it was about half a
frame per second which is within margin
of error and the game overall is is
pretty underwhelming in terms of
graphics it looks great don't get me
wrong but it is not this generations
crisis it is not something that pushes
the 780ti to its limits so we've got
some kind of issue in the software
that's bottleneck in the hardware not
the other way around but moving on from
the hardware stuff because I know a lot
of you aren't necessarily as interested
in that we have plenty of other
wonderful experiences with watchdogs
that I've gone through in the last week
and a lot of it calls back to my
experience working as a test engineer at
at Dell and at other companies doing QA
so the reason I mentioned this is
because I've done Ubisoft a huge favor
and have classified several issues as
severity one or severity two in my full
article that's linked in the description
below and just kind of skimming over
some of these issues that ruin the game
experience entirely as a gamer we had I
experienced three different scenarios
when CT DS crash to desktop would happen
regularly one was with you play online
mode simply being enabled so if you
wanted to use you play which I that
makes you a rarity in and of itself if
you actually wanted to use you play and
you had online mode enabled it would
occasionally and sporadically crash the
desktop another issue
it stemmed from actually was just
completely random I
was a memory link week potentially where
the game would just crash after some
time of plane another issue was a
sporadic audio loop that caused to crash
the desktop I was unsure of which audio
file triggered this I also got blue
screens of death which is 100%
inexcusable in software it's not in the
slightest bit allowed in terms of when I
play a game if I get a blue screen of
death
I am instantly condemning that game for
all manner of reasons and that's because
if a bsod occurs first of all you're not
just losing game data now you are
threatening the users environment in
that if the OS is performing some kind
of right depending on the OS you could
potentially be you could be compromising
the OS and it's stability upon reboot
you can also be compromising the
integrity of an SSD if it's performing
some kind of garbage collection or right
function because SSDs don't like being
shut down randomly when they're
performing these functions and neither
do hard drives and then we've got the
issue of background applications if I
have a Word document open or if I have a
certain tab open in the background and
it's not saved and I get a blue screen
of death from this game I've suddenly
lost that data and so the list goes on
and it's it's problematic and frankly I
hope that other game companies can learn
from this because in my eyes it is
inexcusable for a game company to put
this sort of software out on the market
and this doesn't even get into net
negotiation failures it doesn't get into
you plays servers being unable to handle
the load of their overhyped game it
doesn't talk about servers failing to
synchronize cloud data between multiple
pcs or even on the same PC when forced
to play using local settings due to the
the server downtime and it doesn't talk
about some of the performance issues
we've already discussed and and all
these other things that are actually
frankly so bad that it it's almost
laughable and further on the performance
side a lot of this is happening because
Ubisoft is in terms of the low framerate
is happening because Ubisoft is abusing
it or misusing the page file I didn't
investigate this too heavily but if you
disallow a page file usage and watch
using the steams properties and you're
on a hard drive not an SSD I saw almost
no difference on an SSD then the salient
page file uses usage excuse me will
finally utilize a bit more of the RAM
because for some reason the game does
not natively go about above about 1.9
gigabytes utilization which is kind of
unbelievable given the era we live in
that's actually less RAM usage than
titanfall which is arguably not as
good-looking and and does not require as
much RAM as I came like watchdogs it
would so they're hitting the page file
pretty heavily they're hitting storage
pretty heavily and potentially without
reason because we've got all this very
high speed ram going untouched and that
again tells me that we've got
optimization issues when porting to PC
from consoles even given modern console
architecture largely mirroring pcs being
x86 and both incidents but now we can
talk about fundamental design issues and
move along from me doing a QA job for
free talking about design I've
complained about hand-holding in the
past where a game tells you how to play
it I find that insulting as a player and
off-putting and just really quite
unnecessary I mean we used to play
arcade games that had no hand-holding at
all and you figure it out after a couple
quarters that's because people have some
reasonable level of human intelligence
that should be expected so I've
complained about this regularly
watchdogs doesn't necessarily do a lot
of hand-holding but it does have a lot
of restrictions and we'll go into that
in a second first I want to point out
that watchdogs does a few things very
well it's got a fairly compelling story
not necessarily unique but unique within
the world of gaming it's it's a story
that we've explored in books in movies
but haven't gotten into in an
environment where we can play as the
main character and that is fairly
compelling it actually does have a bit
of emotional pull as a player the game
further has strong central characters
with very visible flaws which is always
a good thing
the backdrop as a sort of cyberpunk
dystopian society or one that is on the
precipice
thereof is very interesting and fun too
to think about the multiplayer drop in
drop out gameplay as a concept is very
good one that you play servers are
functional but all of these things are
obstructed by watchdogs itself watchdogs
in effect is getting in its own way it
is it is both interesting and awful at
the same time and is almost like
Schrodinger's cat is it is Schrodinger
here's a watchdog it is both a good and
bad game simultaneously and that's
because we can't enjoy the good parts of
it because of the bad parts of it so
starting with my hatred of the save
system as I wrote in the full review
linked below the game uses only auto
saving 100% auto saves you are not
allowed to manually save because clearly
as a player you are not qualified to
make the decision of when you should be
saving your content and so the game only
auto saves when you're completing
missions or when you meet reach a major
milestone in some kind of main quest it
doesn't really autosave almost ever
during a side mission which is
problematic and this is problematic for
a few reasons first of all just looking
at all the things I've already
enumerated in terms of bugs if we crash
during a mission especially one that
I've taken 30 minutes to try and figure
out or execute in a particular way that
impacts my reputation within the game in
a particular way and it crashes I've now
lost 30 minutes and that's assuming it
doesn't crash during the right interrupt
my save file which has happened before
by the way because of this auto saving
you're constantly losing data during
crashes if I could manually say every
quick save as I do in Skyrim every 30
seconds out of habit because of its
crashing issues with all the mods I've
installed that is my fault by the way
then this would not be an issue but alas
they don't let us do manual saving and
so we sacrifice data constantly during
crashes now maybe your game doesn't
crash so much so what's the issue then
outside of this well outside of this
removing saving as a
as a manual function from the player
suddenly takes away a huge part of an
open-world game and watchdogs is an
open-world game and the huge part it
takes away is simply the fact that you
should never tell a player how to play
within your open-world you've provided
them you can be open-world or you can be
railroaded you can't be somewhere in the
middle where you're telling them to go
down the road but also giving them the
tantalizing glimpse of the entire world
surrounding them without letting them
have their way with it and this comes
from me speaking as a veteran DM of
tabletop RPGs so so that's kind of my
viewpoint of it and the issue here is
let's take morrowind back when morrowind
was the game to be played I'd often end
a play session by going on some sort of
silly rampage or whatever out of boredom
just to create a challenge for myself
you can't do that here because if you do
you're doing it on your only file for
the character unless you copy/paste it
don't make backups now you're you're
potentially changing how your characters
perceived within game so you can't have
a splitting reality for your character
one with being more anarchistic and one
with being more of a citizen and that
removes a bit of the fun it also makes
it impossible to explore different story
lines or different pathways depending on
how you execute things because once
again you can't manually save once it
auto saves it overwrites whatever you
had before and it generally just makes
things extremely annoying but all of
that is a shadow in comparison to the
input and controls on PC and this is
where we start having issues of user
abandonment of the game the game as I've
explained in previous videos as Mouse
acceleration and mouse smoothing and
both or acceleration rather impacts both
negatively and positively and what these
things do and they exist in Skyrim as
well as they produce a very strange
unintuitive movement of the cursor
across the screen now smoothing attempts
to smooth I don't want to say smooth the
pixels that's not really a correct term
but it's if you think of it that way it
comes from the days of
mice that had the mouse ball when you
would sometimes get sort of a jump or a
jitter in your movement because it would
perhaps not track as many pixels per
inch so that's where my smoothing comes
from it's very useful with analog input
devices like controllers but it's awful
with high precision mice and we end up
with something that feels like it feels
like you've poured maple syrup on your
mousepad and you're attempting to move
your mouse through it it's very sluggish
and lags behind almost where your brain
is telling you the crosshair or the
cursor or whatever should be on the
screen Mouse acceleration is attempting
to keep a more consistent speed of the
mouse as you move it across the screen
so if you're moving too quickly and it's
mind will call it will give it a bit of
an threw for more flies there but moving
too quickly and most acceleration will
try to slow it down a bit that's
negative acceleration moving too slowly
it might try to speed you up to reach
the other side of the screen more
quickly this is atrocious on so many
levels
when it comes to a game where you're
trying to shoot things because now
especially a game like watchdogs we're
shooting them in the knees has a huge
difference from shooting them in the
face in terms of gameplay outcome not
just how efficiently you kill them
because now we we have trouble aiming at
those particular objects and this is
furthered by the fact that there is a
masa stand watchdogs on the PC which is
not only insulting but that's romantic
to the way I want to play the game and
that's just really the start of it so
moving from there we've got issues with
mouse sensitivity and speed as a whole
in different parts of the game watch
dogs is a game that has various menu and
UI elements that change depending on
what you're doing the main menu before
you start the game has an insanely fast
Mouse movement speed which can be cured
easily by decreasing the amount of sense
the the DPI in your mouse or sensitivity
in the options menu but then as soon as
you get in game you realize that the
mouse is incredibly slow because you've
decreased its speed from the menu and
the speed between the game the menu that
hammers you hack and the infrastructure
that you hack and the smartphone and
driving all feels terribly different and
although the speed doesn't actually
change from being in the game to driving
it doesn't execute the same way and this
is in part because of acceleration and
smoothing but that's sort of the it
feels different and that's all that
matters as a player it is actually
different on an objective level between
the menu the camera and in-game movement
so if i hack a camera I've got to
violently move the mouse to get the same
amount of movement I would get with a
half inch half inch pull of the mouse in
the menu and if I'm trying to shoot
someone in the game I've got to move the
mouse a different amount than when I'm
hacking the camera so that's sort of
where I'm coming from there and that's
really obnoxious on many levels as a
gamer to the point where it chases me
away and makes me want to play something
that makes me more mechanical sentence
like Counter Strike where I know exactly
and precisely how the mouse is going to
move every time I pull the mouse it's
not ever changing and the sad thing with
all this stuff is it doesn't even get
into the times that input completely
stops working like when enter no longer
functions as a key within the game
requiring you to restart the game
completely or avoid using enter which is
pretty hard to do in watchdogs since it
has horrible design to begin with in
terms of controls for PC and other than
that I have issues in minimizing I have
to Control Alt Delete to minimize and
then when it comes back up it's in
windowed mode so you have to all to
enter to resume in full-screen
and the best part I think is when alts
get stuck down prefer no apparent reason
so you jump into a car and just hear the
horn for five minutes because that's
what triggers it
so moving on from that we've still got
gameplay to discuss and this is where I
take the quote from my article and say
don't give me an open-world and then
tell me how to play in that world that's
just it's it's not even it's just
teasing the player at that point and I
say this because first of all gameplay
is a bit repetitious which is kind of
normal for open worlds but it's
basically go here hack this kill that or
disable that and and that's okay but
what's not okay is the upsetting rules
they've placed within the missions that
are in the game whether those are main
missions or not so as an example we have
something called mission zones these are
physical these are like actual circles
on the mini-map around your character
where you must execute the mission and
if you exit that zone it'll tell you hey
you're exiting the zone you have ten
seconds to get back in there or you
forfeit the mission so okay this this I
want to stem two topics off of this the
first is just that the mission zones are
very restrictive feeling and the problem
is they don't necessarily expand as you
expand your conflict with the enemy
so if I'm out running an enemy because I
need to reposition myself and I start
exiting that zone and say the enemy is
right behind me the zone doesn't expand
it just because the enemy is right
behind me I have to now turn around do a
u-turn
turn around go back in there and I can't
reposition in the way I want to which is
horrible for gameplay because I don't I
don't need to tell you why if you're all
gamers you know why that sucks it's very
annoying and it sort of kills the
immersion outside of mission zones we've
got issues of a mission failure so when
a mission has failed and you're still
alive meaning you didn't die in trigger
failure maybe because you've exited the
zone or or something when the mission
has failed it'll actually reload you at
the beginning of the mission
reload the last autosave so you lose all
your progress and that progress may
contain things like a vehicle that
you've jacked and you maybe decide you'd
rather keep that and continue playing
without completing the mission or maybe
it contains something like a simple map
positioning you've reached an area that
you'd like to stay in and and so what
should happen here is if you fail the
mission this is similar maybe to just
cause if you fail the mission it should
simply fail the mission and let you keep
playing in your open world and let the
bad guys go do whatever they were gonna
do before inevitably despawning or being
killed or whatever instead it just
reloads you at the start of it which
tampers with how the player potentially
wants to play your open-world game
you've created then we've got an option
in the game to abort or abandon a
mission and if you choose that it does
the same thing it'll reload you at some
nearby spawn or autosave and you once
again lose anything you've accumulated
during that mission and so far as map
positioning vehicles and things like
that and that's just the start of the
gameplay issues I think no matter what
whether you agree with me or not on the
gameplay there's really very little room
for argument on the objective Hardware
performance data and optimisation which
are outright terrible and I sincerely
doubt will ever be resolved to any
reasonable extent it's it's just too far
along and they already delayed the game
several months I'm gonna do it then
they're not gonna do it now they're
gonna keep making DLC and push more
content at you for you to purchase so
what does this tell us it tells us that
these game development studios and
publishers really need to learn from
watchdogs they really need to learn from
battlefield 4 they need to learn from
Titan falls abuse of its PC players and
I've written articles about that if
you're not sure what I'm talking about
and overall we need to be more careful
of hype this is something that's been
touched on for as long as the game the
game industry has been around and just I
wish watchdogs didn't have such lazy
game design because I really want to
enjoy the story but it is what it is I
would strongly urge all PC gamers to
avoid this title save yourself to $60 I
bought this game out of pocket and only
we try to get review samples
but we could not get one in time for
this one so I bought it myself did all
the benchmarking and I'm now doing this
review I would say avoid it go buy
something that's actually good is
something that respects your 50 or $100
Mouse that's got high precision is
something that respects your ability to
aim as a player and something that
respects your ability to make decisions
as a human and that's all I've got to
say about watchdogs full article linked
