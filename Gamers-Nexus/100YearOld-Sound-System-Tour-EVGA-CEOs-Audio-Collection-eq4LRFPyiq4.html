audio room a condo just outside of
Taipei that's dedicated to the most
impressive audio setup we've ever seen
Andrew Hahn CEO of EVGA sees his audio
room as a microcosm for his business and
has invested over 20 years into tuning
and tweaking his gear and acquiring part
some of the components in the room are
100 years old or older and there are two
major eye-catching pieces giant horns
from Western Electric that were made in
the early 1930s this setup gave us an
opportunity to hear what is probably the
best sound system we'll ever listen to
but also to compare sound quality
between cables digital and analog
players and more before that this video
is brought to you by US and the gamers
Nexus anti-static mod map the GN
anti-static magma is a four foot by two

high-quality industrial grade
anti-static material and includes a

dotnet to pick up a GN mod mat today at
one point in history Western Electric
was the world's most powerful electrical
engineering company Western Electric
made military radios theater sound
systems home electronics government
electronics commercial speakers and
power components and more Western
Electric was officially founded in 1869
but its engineers began producing
electrical equipment and prototypes in
the early 1800s
Western Electric was routinely leveraged
as a workaround to antitrust regulations
pertaining to Bell and AT&amp;amp;T and owned
half of Bell Labs while also
manufacturing most of the equipment that
AT&amp;amp;T used and deployed back before the
split from the government monopoly
crackdown this company also produced
high-end audio equipment including the
Western Electric horn 15a and the first
ever hi-fi sound driver the sound system
we saw consists of decades of research
and finding rare audio equipment then
working to design custom parts to make
it all fit in the audio room the most
immediately intimidating part would be
again
the Western electric horn 50 nays that
flanked the room each of which stand
upwards of 13 feet high from top to
bottom and have five foot wide openings
for symphonic audio these horns weigh
140 pounds and are primarily made of
wood
built back around 1930 originally as for
the driver that's hooked into the end of
the horn
that's the we5 five five and it's from
1926 the driver is mounted 3.1 meters
behind the horn opening and output sound
waves it down the horn tubing until it
ricochets out the end this is the first
hi-fi driver made and has a range of 120
Hertz to 4,500 Hertz the horn had to be
made large enough to make the range work
though and other frequencies are filled
in by the subwoofer and the tweeter the
total range of the system is 80 Hertz to
10 kilohertz with the we5 9:7 a tweeter
handling 4500 hertz and up and the
subwoofer handling 120 hertz and below
the driver takes the middle range for
those other parts the tweeter was made
in 1930 and is the five nine seven a the
subwoofer is an 18-inch sub with a paper
cone made of palm leaves so it's
extremely fragile but it provides the
best sound possible collecting these
parts is hard particularly as some of
them have corroded over the years or
just vanished in general a han had to
have custom wooden paneling made for the
horn to recreate the original look and I
was done by a professional reproduction
company in Italy as the original wood
had decayed long ago the stands to hold
the horns were also custom-designed
as each horn weighs 140 pounds before
accounting for the woofer box underneath
and that's another major element the
wooden panels in front of the subwoofer
are carefully angled to influence the
direction of the sound it's by design
and engineering not just to look cool
and the rear paper-thin flaps are in
place to ensure that the sound doesn't
get trapped within the lower chamber
also located in the back of the horn
there's one large inductor coil at the
base of each rated at 16 milli henries
and it acts as a part of the high-pass
filter to the subwoofer there's one
microfarad a capacitor located on top of
the horn originally from Western
Electric which is also part of the
driver set up for a canonical view of
the sound system it works like this
the sound originates at the record where
a sound specific cartridge attachment
reads the record Hahn has a container
for his cartridges and can choose the
best one for a given record or genre for
this player the sound system is using an
SME 32 R 12 inch needle which leverages
its length the better reduce torque and
provide a better sound quality overall
an air pump is located under the player
and is used to pump air under the record
to float the record when in use with a
record clamp keeping the vinyl level
during rotation when playing digital CDs
instead Hani's is an older students CD 3
which he says produces better sound than
the DSC equipment that he just got in
this step-up transformer is fed a signal
by the tech das MC phono cartridge TDC
o1 which sits at the end of the record
player needle and outputs at about 0.45
millivolts the step-up transformer takes
that voltage and amplifies it by about
600 times after the step-up transformer
the sound feeds into a preamp which then
magnifies the voltage again the real
amplifiers are the audio notes
gaaah Kwan's which use united 211 tubes
and copper plated amplifier boxes in the
back of the setup this was the final
United 211 tube in production
these tubes run at about 30 watts each
for the copper plated amps and
rectifiers and feed into the driver
tweeter and subwoofer as for what's
powering all of this there are two
primary sources
there's the preamp power which isn't all
that exciting or different and then
there are the tongue guard bulbs these
were made by GE in 1916 and are the
oldest part of the setup that we were
able to locate they were originally used
for AC to DC battery charging and the
name tongue guard comes from the
construction of the bulb these use a
tungsten filament and argon gas and were
used all the way up through these 70s in
various forms the tongue guard bulbs
pushed seven volts for the driver and
twenty four volts for the woofer
powering each horn assembly separately
but from one box the tongue guard bulbs
have interesting thermal characteristics
too and take some literal warming up to
get peak sound quality out of them as
for wattage the driver cable is dealing
with five watts or less so it's actually
not that much power at the
of the day we had an opportunity to
listen for differences between analog
and digital sound sources as a full
disclosure because this is extremely
subjective we entered this experiment
extremely skeptical this was something
that we assumed we would never hear a
difference from whatsoever and it didn't
take long though to identify some
differences between analog and digital
with analog sounding slightly fuller and
deeper and tone this we think is
primarily a result of two things one is
the digital to analog converter and the
other one is the fact that this speaker
system is likely the best we'll ever
hear in our lifetime on a lesser system
with an equivalent D to a we'd expect
the analog versus digital differences to
be minimized or impossible to hear but
for this high-end audio setup it's just
barely noticeable cables were another
interesting point of discussion for all
the audiophile tendencies of EVGA CEO
Andrew Hahn he tells us that he doesn't
believe high-end cables make a
difference in his specific setup
although Huynh tested cables that cost
several thousand dollars for a meter he
ultimately hand built his own cables for
under 150 bucks and says that there is
no audible difference in sound between
the two the sound itself is impressive
hands down is highly directional with
the best listening position about five
rows back so to speak and in the center
of the two horns because the driver is
positioned three meters behind the horn
opening with the tweeter in the middle
of the horn and the sub below it the
sound comes out with great depth you can
hear the distance of each sound one from
the other especially given that the
entire assembly is 13 feet tall for the
setup or larger and it's got a five foot
wide mouth sound is very specific to
each setup as always and this setup
makes it feel like musicians are in the
room literally positioned behind the
horn openings it's an interesting effect
from a long gating the sound wave from
the driver and works best with symphonic
and orchestral music this isn't a
surround system it's highly directional
and closest replicates a concert venue
from again a few rows back where someone
managing the sound might sit some of
these parts are a hundred years old but
managed to produce the best sound we've
ever heard as for why EVGA Cee
put all this together he sees it again
as a microcosm for his business han
tells us that he spent two decades
collecting all these parts about as long
as he spent building EVGA
and he is now in fine tuning stages of
his business han told us that he is also
tuning EVGA to continually improve
operations just like he's doing with his
high-end sound system on also set the
system up personally did all the
research and got hands-on with assembly
he sees this as a way to remain in tune
with the enthusiasts customers who like
to build things and takes great pride in
remaining active and enthusiasts
hardware assembly EVGA CEO calls some of
the parts priceless giving great credit
to eBay and Google for affording him the
tools to find individuals all over the
world who had these parts in storage or
in lingering use that concludes our
