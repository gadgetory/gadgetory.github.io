our tour in China was a company
responsible for making a product that
all of you end up with this Factory has
millions of US dollars worth of
equipment and is highly automated with
human operators needed primarily to man
computers reprogram machines or move it
one ton reels of paper around this is a
Wenli paper which is one of the
cardboard factories that coolermaster
and other product makers use to make the
boxes that their products ship in the
cardboard industry has been booming with
the increase of online retail like
Amazon allowing these factories to
rapidly expand this video will walk
through how cardboard is made by
third-party suppliers for the PC
component companies that we all buy from
before that this video is brought to you
by be quiet and it's straight power 11
series power supplies the straight power
11 PSU is shipped from 450 Watts up to a
thousand watts accommodating most of the
gaming PC build requirements you'd
encounter and focuses on delivering a
higher quality power supply that doesn't
sacrifice on efficiency or stability
noise is also a heavy point for the
straight power 11 using a 135
millimeters silent wayne's 3 fan that
can spin as low as 200 rpm for quieter
low load operation learn more at the
link in the description below cardboard
boxes start life as a mix of synthetic
materials potentially recycled materials
and trees a higher concentration of
nutrient the cardboard increases the
cost and the quality of the cardboard
and so companies often use a mix of
other materials to reduce cost or having
recently begun using partially recycled
cardboard for their new cardboard
manufacturing this factory buys its
paper supply and giant spools that weigh
one ton per roll the spools are stacked
in the tall warehouse and moved around
only by truck this Factory has a policy
to keep 7,000 tons of paper in stock for
its warehouse constantly just in case
there's a large order influx or surge
and ordering but the factory makes and
sells about 10,000 tons of cardboard
every single month the company also
processes about 700,000 square meters of
cardboard per day making it one of the
highest volume suppliers in contact with
our industry and one of
the bigger cardboard suppliers for
Coolermaster customer orders dictate the
type of cardboard being made it ranges
from low-quality stuff like you've
probably gotten in Aliexpress orders to
the high quality boxes that contain
heavier cases like what the C 700 M
might ship in where it's multiple layers
to keep the strength when shipping a
heavy box doubling the layer count costs
about 20 percent more but that cost does
add up quickly based on the order
cardboard is loaded into a machine
stretching across the entire factory
floor spanning at least a couple hundred
feet in length
multiple rolls can be added for
multi-layer cardboard manufacturing and
just for reference on what the final
cardboard box with printed art might
cost it really depends and we don't know
what cooler masters boxes cost but we
know that some of the high-end GPUs and
we can't say which ones shipping boxes
that cost upwards of $20 us and that's
cost that's not what the consumer pays
so this stuff can get expensive fast
particularly depending on how dense the
cardboard is how many bends there are
and the type of art that's applied and
any additional packing materials used
within today the factory is making
cardboard with just three layers there's
a flat top layer there's a crank old
middle layer for strength notice the
flutes and then there's another flat top
layer or liner to start the process a
driver picks up the cardboard roll and
aligns it with a chain in the floor the
chain slowly pulls the cardboard into
the Machine and each reel is stretched
across a giant slow turning roller then
fed under smaller rollers to straighten
and stretch the cardboard multiple of
these rolls of cardboard go into the
machine at a time each of which is fed
through to make the multi-layer
cardboard that comes out the other side
after the cardboard is mounted and has
begun going through the rollers the card
gets heated to 110 to 120 degrees
Celsius to make it easier to shape and
then it's been through a corrugator
wheel that creates those highly
identifiable crinkles found in stiffer
grade cardboard the cardboard conforms
to the pattern in the surface of the
wheel as it's fed through and while this
is happening the flat layers or the
liners are being fed through stretching
wheels and aligned with the new crinkled
flute piece of cardboard between other
layers of cardboard are instead fed
through an upstairs part of the machine
which unravels the thinnest pieces of
the cardboard paper into a long sheet
then stretches it as it's fed into the
lower chambers the paper is fed through
the intersection of the machine and
through several more rollers stretching
the paper as it goes and eventually
meeting the crinkled paper at a glueing
terminal this part of the machine
applies a thin layer of glue to the
cardboard so that all the layers stick
together the glue first applies to the
roller which then rolls around and
applies to the inner side of the liner
it also rolls all three individual
sheets toward the steamer the cardboard
is next steamed at about 160 to 180
degrees Celsius with all three sheets
going through the steamer and through
the wheels these begin bonding together
but the new concern is that any leftover
water could cause microbial growth or
mold to resolve this the factory feeds
the newly bonded cardboard through a
large oven which then dries out the
moisture from the earlier steaming
process the cardboard now proceeds to
get cut this machinery is highly
advanced and maintained regularly and is
responsible for finalizing the product
for the customer which would be
Coolermaster or someone like that the
sizes are programmed into the machine by
a technician then the blades can be
moved into place by the machine the
cardboard is cut first long ways by a
series of wheels the machine presently
has about seven wheels on the equipment
but only uses a few of them for this
particular order some will stay raised
if the current order doesn't require
more granularity of the cuts but
otherwise they can all be programmed
through the computer located nearby
after this cuts are made in the other
direction at which point we have our
finalized cardboard panels that make the
boxes these cuts are made with a giant
wheel that has a blade mounted long ways
slicing the cardboard as it rolled the
timing is also programs in software to
make the cuts at the appropriate time to
intervals to ensure that the cardboard
sheets come out in the size that was
specified a digital sign Hayden from the
factory ceiling gives us some detail on
how much carbon is being made regularly
links to the automated machines the sign
tells us that 1,100 meters are there
abouts of the current reel remain and
that there's about 20,000 meters that
have been sent through this machine just
today the bottom right number gives us
the service area
and then on the left side of the sign we
see the speed reported in meters per
minute the average speed and the defect
rate in that order the machine was
paused while we took this shot so it's
current speed is zero in the close up
the factory tries to keep the defect
rate to around 1% and we'll pause
occasionally for inspection if the
defect rate exceeds that threshold as we
near the end of the production line the
carpet is fed onto a large elevator
machine that slowly accepts cardboard
one sheet at a time as it fills up the
elevator lowers to accommodate more
paper in the stack once full the Machine
offloads its halt to a series of
automated conveyor belts on two
different two axes one belt offloads the
cardboard onto a sort of barge with
conveyer belts this then moves the
cardboard in front of a giant series of
fans pulling down the cardboard after
the arduous journey that involves a lot
of heating to ensure that everything
bonded together the factory tells us
that cooling the cardboard for 10 to 15
seconds will results in the strongest
final material but that some customers
may want a lower price and so will allow
for reduced targeted cooling time to
keep that price low and finally the
cardboard is placed onto a pallet jack
and prepared for the customers it can be
turned into a box at different factories
and printing happens elsewhere for any
companies that have box art but today
we're just looking at the brown
cardboard used to contain the outer
product for shipping for example from
China to the US so that's it for this
one it was a pretty short tour but shows
you how one of the least thought of
elements of a computer product is made
