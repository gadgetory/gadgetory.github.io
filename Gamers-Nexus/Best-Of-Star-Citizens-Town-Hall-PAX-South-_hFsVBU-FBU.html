panelists today but probably not what
was that but and this is actually quite
different looks of the other reveals
that we've done where we've actually had
a polished ever because that's all going
to happen in March when we sort of show
the actual planetside in operation we
show the FPS module which would be
releasing that is kind of like 1.1 will
be to social module and also including
the FPSO but we talked about it once a
crime as mobile as contact lens in game
chat punch Santa Barbara can go and
export shopping so we can't necessarily
buy stuff yet that would probably the
next major milestone on the planet side
stuff but we eventually around shouts be
able to do the movie glass see stats how
much Castle the rest of stuff and then
also we're sort of moving to a sauce
impart motif which is kind of similar to
the old wing by the way leaves happen
there's arcade machine in the pilots
referee week we want to talk about that
piece of art knock that is a jump we're
really when you sin things through
it has to go through the state and
basically what it does is it would be
seized pigeons that are like robotic
their little robotic things that go
through a jump go ahead and come out the
other side and then there's another
relay that grabs the pigeons from the
other side relays the message through
through jumping so that's what about
things very cool I read said attend to
it right because of tents and whenever i
taunted concept artists in austin has
done some pretty awesome stuff and we
want to talk about this is the complex
system this is just sort of a UI sure
yeah this so as mentioned in one of the
panels earlier basically in the short
term we're importing your contact list
from the website what we're going to
wind up doing probably the version after
the social modules we should actually
have these full true friends to where
you extend an invitation to someone and
they actually have to accept that and
basically that it
and so the relevance of the contact list
next slide introverts to the social
module is that allows you so this is a
mock-up of actually being in your
elevator and what you're seeing down
here at the bottom left is our the
destinations that you can go to what do
you do on planetside landing zones 10 in
the short-term you're going to do I
hesitate to say shopping because it's
really window shopping would be more
accurate that's exactly right you will
be able to look but you will not be able
to buy you'll be able to so this what
this is basically showing you is a
mock-up of the shopping interface early
early paintings we carry on tradition
and here's one of the first shops this
is the one where your cubby blast you
can't buy love your personal weapons of
personal armor you have grenades
ammunition things of that sort so this
is a early in game prototype muggy glass
stuff
that's my wife's going into the open to
the hour together so you can turn your
er mode and sort of show you locations
or stuff yes we're going to actually we
are we with you the whole alone to look
at it you're not necessarily gonna do
this in mobile iphone classic contacts
it's still a little and the concept with
immobilizer there's going to be all
these applications it can be loaded and
lots of the applications in the context
sensitive so the applications will be
things that you would buy a handsome
advance so you use things for shopping
or navigation marriages your friends or
talking about missions
now one other thing i guess to mention
since we will have one of the shops is
we will not have nearly as diverse a
selection of things to browse and all
the other shops because there is a huge
amount of promises that they need to be
created you know for those so we'll
probably to have some run this is that
this is the Colbert was an old if you
would disturb their phones and
Lily prototype of the baby glass I think
we're actually talking about having a
combination of an augmented reality that
you have with the contact lenses or
glasses you would wear and then if
you're currently go like doing the clip
of the web browsing that would be sort
of projected so you don't always have to
bring you are about to see stem fishes
sort of what kind of plan is this is the
customs area that we talked about
earlier that you have to pass through
regardless of whether you land in a
public land examiner in your own private
hangar you eventually have to go through
customs before your leaded to you know
the Lightning's own proper and that's
where for example they would refuse
admittance if you had a weapon on you
and you had done something that it
caused your your license to carry for
some period of time to a bit revoked at
which point you have to go back to your
ship or your hangar stow your weapon
away and then they would actually allow
you to proceed yeah this is basically
serve certain a couple different
purposes one is when you actually die
you know out you know outside or even in
town this is basically where you would
wind up us respawning this is also where
you can buy a variety of items related
to new healing defibrillators stimulant
packs bandages yeah that's worth a this
is an example of some of our early
hourly characters that have layer
systems built into them so the pants for
instance you could take the pants off of
this dude just a level of interactivity
you know that we want to achieve
starting down starting to build
characters in that with that environment
the grinning a stroke on this is Astro
Amarna it's a high-end ship dealer
that's this particular one is but this
is kind of like your kind of Porsche
dealership although they do sell right
ships not just once that's kind of the
again I mean once you go across the
galaxy you're not going to see your shop
or say see a lot of different kinds of
shops still shifts per se
you know will be different levels of
quality sharps that one just happens to
you we go you can show kind of what it's
going to look like
and we let's see the game the other side
knows you'll see how like the different
like vortexes warp it as you going
around sir there's a little bit things
you have to avoid as your flag through
jump point he was done someone has to be
good or actually takes enjoys flying so
trying to talk the audience so you want
to talk about the various places with
we're going to be going in the early
alpha of listeners so this is next salad
won't fix well mark and talk about all
the artistic aspects but basically nicks
is a being more lightly regulated planet
to where you would more likely be able
to sell some of the others know whether
the entire the entire establishment
exists within a large crater on an
asteroid and so step with your feed
regards to explaining their role it's
basically a huge excavating a crater and
around the edges they wasn't originally
a mining colony and this was it was
originally a mining colony
and they were having these machines set
up and they've been you know holy stuff
out of it for a while I could have dried
up so they left it as squatters came in
political activists and pirates and took
it over and kind of made it their own
and set up shop there there's a lot of
kind of like around the lip of this big
crater is a lot of like blown out areas
where they kind of built in you know
various various shops and things like
that so we're basically at a time like
to thank everybody again for coming out
especially when a big thank you for
chris Roberts for coming out to I spent
some time talking with is so nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
