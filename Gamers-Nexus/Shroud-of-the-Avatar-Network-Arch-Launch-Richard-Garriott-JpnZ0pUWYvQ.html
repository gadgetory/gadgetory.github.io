access net and i am joined by richard
garriott AKA lord british and me talking
about shroud of the avatar got a couple
of other topics as well that'll go up in
separate videos so check the channel for
those before getting to that content all
of our pact coverage is brought to you
by cyberpowerpc who were awarded the
reader's choice for best desktop gaming
pcs by pc magazine richard with trial
the avatar so we've done a couple of
these videos can you give a really brief
recap for everyone sure sure so you know
most people who know me would know me
i'm not only his Lord British but as the
author of the Ultima series I made nine
altimas and an ultimaum line after I
went independent created the only
science fiction game have made called
tabula rasa but I've now gone back to
medieval fantasy for my latest offering
and it really is sort of the spiritual
successor to ultima but it's merging
both what i think are the best features
of solo player storytelling out of the
Ultima series about virtues and the best
aspects of Ultima Online where the the
massively multiplayer world is not just
about level grinding and combat there's
a full life to be realized as a crafter
or as a role player that is I would
argue very very deep and while most
memos have continued to chase the world
of warcraft model we're going back to
the Ultima model which we think has some
at least personal interest and we think
still has some some lasting value so if
you liked altimas or if you have friends
who told you about them if you're too
young come treasure out of the avatar
and we we also just spoke with warren
spector an old friend co-worker of yours
and he worked on alta might as well oh
yeah absolutely hey we worked many in
fact I would argue that the best solo
player altimas definitely the best told
stories in the solar player ultimate
where times when Warren and I work
together he you know I think he would
have in fact I think then the piece I've
seen you guys talk about you know he
gives us a lot of credit me and others
at origin for teaching him some of the
game design the industry
nuts and bolts but what he definitely
brought in day one from outside the
computer gaming industry was story
crafts and so I'm very proud of the
story craft in the Ultima is you know
kind of five six seven era where Warren
and I work together on those games and
now with shroud of the avatar so you've
you've been pushing for a while now it
what's the sort of release timeline
what's the schedule yeah we we've been
going a little more than 28 months the
reason why no 28 is because we're on
release 28 and one per month and so we
had a few months where there were no
really before there was released one but
but for 28 months now on the third
Thursday of the month we released at
twelve noon central time the latest
version of the of the game and it's been
live now 24 hours a day seven days a
week not since episode one but I camber
which episode we started that in but
long ago and and we've actually have a
service now that has had zero
unscheduled downtime since the beginning
we talked about that before and when we
last thought it may have been six or
more months ago and we last talked out
that so you've kept with that record
that record and we we've we've launched
within a minute maybe two minutes of the
you know but pointed our and we've had
no unscheduled downtime which we keep
you know knocking on wood because we've
come close to unscheduled downtime we've
actually had the login servers fail so
no one knew could join it but if you
were in it was still alive so we've
technically still always been up still
counts but I mean there will come a time
when it goes down I'm sure but but it
actually has to do with the architecture
we've chosen which is why it stayed up
you know if you think of most massively
multiplayer games especially or online
games generally you you're playing on a
central server you're you're in a
client-server kind of architecture which
means if the server goes down everyone
is disconnected shroud of the avatar
doesn't operate that way shroud of the
average are operates where everyone
who's playing their machine is part of
the web
of servers that the game is using to
operate and so that foundational change
made to important changes what does it
means our servers are small what we have
in house is just the login server and
some authentication inter activities the
majority of what's happening with the
game being processed is happening in the
cloud of people and so we've already
prepared it for what happens when you
just turn off your machine or somebody
balloons blue screens or somebody's
trying to hack it or cheat and or has a
really slow machine that just doesn't
perform well since the fundamental
architecture assumed all those faults we
had to make a really fault tolerant
system that accepts the fact that
individual pieces go offline now and
then and that turned out to work much
better than we had anticipated and kept
the service running 24 hours a day seven
days a week so is this it doesn't sound
quite like p2p but it actually does have
some PDP peer-to-peer you know concepts
in it you know not only do our updates
actually spread in a actually
peer-to-peer torrent you know kind of
way but it's the the the way it sort of
works is if a group of people is in a
common area of geography that it can
portion off and say I know for a fact
these the only people in the region I
care about their machines then start to
operate in a synchronous fashion and so
actually all of us are doing the
processing of the whole game but one of
us is chosen as the the metronome you
know the this the the synchronizer you
might say but if you go offline or have
a hiccup of one kind or another it just
falls down to the next one of us to be
the the synchronization heartbeat and
the one that verifies that the truth is
happening does the game look at systems
Baxter or performance it does yeah we
don't we don't we try not to push that
on somebody with a weak machine we
actually we do that analysis and we say
whoever's got the strongest machine is
going to do it because the thing they're
going to pick up on their machine that
others don't have to pick up is AI and
so everyone everyone's machine is
independently tracking every AI but one
person is saying the reality is that
rabbit moved lat
and nobody else goes yeah I get it and I
they update their position but as soon
as your heartbeat goes down suddenly go
oh I'm the one now running the rabbits
now the rabbit moves right you know
whatever it might be and and then the
exception to this sort of round robin
synchronization is for things like
trades of gold or for victory conditions
I me know if I kill the rabbit then we
need to go let's make sure nobody's hack
their client let's make sure you know
you're not trying to steal gold from me
and so that type of activity then is
verified back at our central server and
and you know I'm sure some people will
find some way to hack it eventually and
will in the arms rate will end up in an
arms race with the players but so far
it's actually this method again because
everyone is still synchronized
everyone's machine is literally
synchronized so it's sort of like the
the Bitcoin you know process where you
know to to defeat something at that
public you have to overwhelm you know
the public belief is to what's happening
which is a bit harder right what about
the target release timeline seems like
that where should people go to find out
more yeah so the websites easy WWE
shroud of the avatar calm come join us
if you haven't already if especially if
you understand ultimate history or
frankly a lot of the other histories of
Warren and there's so many of us to work
together on so many games anything from
origin and you know a lot of the Star
Wars Galaxies folks are really X origin
also so anyway there's a common thread
through a lot of our history that for
those we remember those days a lot of
that is what we're trying to recover but
in a modern way so come join us if you
if you are so inclined and the real main
release was really at the end of the
year so if you're if you don't want to
get involved in a beta process you can
wait til December but if you like having
an impact on the game then join us
sooner and and after that we hope to
release new episodes which while the
features will just keep adding over time
month by month but the new releases of
major segments of content including new
entire continents to go explore we're
gonna do that on one year cadence so you
know Christmas time every year we should
have a nice package of wrapped up
content for you expansion content
something like that very cool so as
always information in the description
below a shroud of the avatar calm if
you're interested in learning more we've
done a few of these videos so if you
