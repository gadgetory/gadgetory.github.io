nexus donna and we just got back from
MLG raleigh 2012 it was an awesome show
with a very good run from several
players actually we saw I think my
personal favorite was crank which is who
we are talking about right now and I
have been up for 23 hours that let's do
this we have cranked who played all the
way through the open bracket through
group play and and was eventually
knocked out by hero but he became a
crowd favorite throughout the course of
the weekend by his phenomenal
performances and his consistent play and
tight control of Protoss so let's just
go through a very fast recap Before we
jump to an interview that we did with
crank first of all cranked in the open
bracket started off against a couple he
actually started off with a by in a
bracket three he had a by round two he
to ode spiral round three he 202 in
control around four he 20 Jim rising
round five he to ode tubby the fat round
six he to ott one and then continuing on
into group play he too on taysia to ode
revival and then finally was defeated in
round four of group play by hero 24 hero
/ crank where he then dropped down
played against Asia again in an extended
series where crank 143 and then replayed
against hero in the finals of the group
play where where crank lost 4-3 favoring
hero unfortunately at this point it was
determined he would be in the losers
bracket where he played against heart
and lost 2-1 favoring heart but we were
able to catch up with him after his
final match for an interview so check
out this footage from the show floor I
will warn you that the lighting was
terrible but we did our best to
accommodate it enjoy this interview with
