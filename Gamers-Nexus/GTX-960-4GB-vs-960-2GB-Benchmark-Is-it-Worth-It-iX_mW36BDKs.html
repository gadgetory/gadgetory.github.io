the gtx 960 and for gigabyte form so the
gtx 960 shipped a while ago we have a
full review on the channel and on the
website and i've described the
architecture i've described the memory
subsystem done the benchmarks today
we're looking at the 4 gigabyte version
this is an EVGA gtx at 960 Super SC it's
a super clocked card ships with higher
clocks than the reference design and it
is 4 gigabytes equipped so the stock
model ships with 2 gigabytes of memory
and that's what I have in this Asus
Strix 960 which is the one I tested the
4 gigabyte model against and this is a 2
gigabyte card so that is more similar to
what shipped a few months ago and what
we're looking at with the 4 gigabyte
card is strictly one thing here it's
will 4 gigabytes of video memory
actually get utilized will it benefit
you as a user versus the 2 gigabyte 960
model that is already out for $210 the 4
gigabyte model this EVGA one
specifically is available at about 240
250 depending on where you look so it's
a price jump of about $30 and we need to
know whether that actually gets you
anything in gaming historically for
gigabyte cards have not necessarily done
a whole lot versus 2 2 gigabyte
counterparts and this is because of all
kinds of bottlenecks elsewhere in the
architecture and with the 960 the
concerns are still present so we have a
128-bit memory interface on the gtx 960
and even the GK 106 predecessor to the
GM 206 which is what the 960 uses had a
larger memory interface it had 192 bits
however Nvidia EVGA everyone will be
very quick to tell you that the Maxwell
architecture is well optimised for
memory it actually uses a lot of memory
compression technology including Delta
color compression which compresses about
18% of the memory transactions occurring
within the chip and the memory so this
ultimately produces better performance
on the GM 206 versus the GK 106 despite
having a smaller memory interface so
it's not all just a numbers game there's
all kind
a compression going on there too if you
look at all the other technological
updates in the Maxwell architecture we
end up with about a 25% bandwidth
increase and memory capabilities and
transactions so overall it is better
than the predecessor despite the numbers
being slightly lower still 128 bits even
with the 112 is gigabytes per second
memory bandwidth of the 960 has the GM
206 has we're not 100% sure on paper
whether a four gigabyte card will
benefit the user and so that's what we
tested in these tests in order to make
sure we were actually utilizing the
memory what we did was we first measured
the video memory consumption of each of
the major titles and I'm only showing a
few of them here on this chart but we
did test all of them and they're all
linked in the description below the
whole article delves into all this very
deeply including the memory architecture
and games like Assassin's Creed unity
far cry 4 and battlefield hardline
somewhat unsurprisingly use the most
video memory and in theory should get
the most direct benefit from my 4
gigabyte card because they're actually
exceeding 2 gigabytes so one would think
that because they're exceeding 2
gigabytes then a 4 gigabyte card will
allow greater frame rates this isn't
always the case and we'll go into that
in a second here let's talk about what
video memory actually does before
looking at the benchmark numbers video
memory on a video card is gddr5 memory
and it is significantly faster than ddr3
system memory it is also located
physically on the PCB
where the GPU is located so it doesn't
have the transfer over such great
distances as we would with ddr3 it also
limits some of the interfaces and bosses
that we have to travel through to
communicate between the GPU the rest of
the card subsystems and the memory so
for this reason we want to store as much
of the games information on the video
card memory as possible some of the
things that gets stored in the video
memory would include textures which if
you download mods for Skyrim you might
have 4k resolution textures those are
definitely being stored in the video
memory up to the
Pasi limits and this allows the video
card to more rapidly transact fetch that
memory that's containing the textures
and display it on the screen without too
much of a frame drop or noticeable
jitter in the frame performance we also
store things like shadow maps and normal
maps and specular maps all these
different mapping elements that are used
artistically in the game to display
information with a certain effect those
are all stored in the video memory and
then they're accessed effectively every
frame so that's pretty regularly now
what happens when we run out of memory
on the video card
well what ends up going on is the system
memory and the video card memory must
swap with each other they have to start
swapping data and we store only the most
frequently accessed files in the video
memory or the currently accessed files
in the video memory everything else is
the system memory during the swapping
we're forcing the transaction to occur
through a PCIe bus and that adds latency
that adds physical travel time to access
the system memory so now we have added
latency just to go through the bus to
get to the system memory come back and
we're communicating with a CPU during
all this and the GPU and it adds a lot
of overhead so you want to avoid that
wherever possible and you really the
only good way to do that is to improve
the memory subsystem of the architecture
and to improve the capacity of the
memory on the video card which is the
one we've done here with the GTX 960
have four gigabytes when the video card
begins cashing out on the memory you'll
start seeing things like very large and
noticeable frame drops and gameplay so
you might see a sudden minimum of 9 FPS
your game sort of just freezes almost
out of nowhere and that's when it's
fetching dumping and swapping data most
likely it could be a million other
things as well but if we're talking
strictly on the video card side that's
sort of what it would be and then we
have to wait for it to catch up and
refresh everything and we can play at a
normal frame rate again but it's not
always this simple because everything
depends on how the game has been
optimized how the drivers have been
optimized how the video card was built
how the architecture is engineered how
the API like DirectX or mantle is
interacting with
all this in between so there's a million
parts to this and it's not as simple as
just memory but strictly for purposes of
this benchmark we're only looking at
memory to whatever extent is permissible
games like Assassin's Creed far cry 4
are very poorly optimized so we can only
get so far with those games and games
like Metro last light and grid are
extremely well optimized and that
presents other problems as we discuss in
the article linked below so it's a very
interesting problem the benchmark and to
sort of scientifically try to try to
draw conclusions of system performance
so how does this thing perform well in
Assassin's Creed unity we see one of the
biggest disparities in performance at
the 1% and 0.1% lows and these lows are
representative of your effective minimum
for the 0.1% and your most noticeable
frame drops for 1% when I say these
percentages what I mean is with 1% low
you're reflecting 1% of the lowest
performing frames so rather than looking
at an outlier like minimum which a lot
of sites do we're looking at something
that's more statistically replicable and
noticeable to the user so at 1080p
assassin's creed sees a giant jump from
the minimums at the 4 gigabyte and 2
gigabyte cards but it's not persistent
through all the other games with far cry
4 our gains are much less interesting
the only really massive difference is at
1440p where we see the lows jump 52%
using the 4 gigabyte card and that
actually does become quite noticeable in
gameplay it's a lot less jarring in this
fashion but not all games even are like
this so you have grid Autosport you see
in this chart almost no difference
whatsoever at any resolution for the
performance of 4 gigabytes versus a 2
gigabyte card and specifically talking
out this EVGA card we're testing they
market the device as up being that are
optimized for 4k gaming and better
allowing higher textures and higher
resolution gaming at 4k so 4k is sort of
a buzzword for the card in terms of
marketing speak and that's why I'm
testing all these games with 4k
resolution except for Assassin's Creed
which is really far too heavy on the GPU
to test at that resolution Metro last
light is another title that sees
effectively 0
from four gigabytes of video memory with
the GTX 960 at all resolutions from 1080
to 4k and so in this instance it's not
worth buying if you're just playing
about your last slide
we've got city skylines a new game
that's actually really cool for 4k
testing because it is the kind of game
you would want to play at 4k and I say
that because you when you zoom out you
really can see a lot of the game at once
you can fit a lot on the screen and it
looks good at a high resolution
but even so doesn't change the fact that
there's no noticeable gain using a four
gigabyte card versus a two gigabyte card
and then finally we look at battlefield
hardline a new battlefield title that
uses massive amounts of video memory 4
gigabytes effectively in the test that I
was running using a four gigabyte card
so it was maxing out the memory and in
battlefield hardline we do see pretty
substantial differences between 4k
resolutions with the cars I know this
only has average FPS that's because we
couldn't measure with fraps I'll explain
in the article regardless big difference
with 4k but still unplayable 4k even
using the 4 gigabyte card that said if
you were to tweak your settings and
lower them from Ultra down to high or
hybrid of medium high then you will see
an advantage with the 4 gigabyte card
that is actually playable 1080 and 1440
not quite as impressive and and we do
see a bit less gains at these
resolutions overall we can look at
synthetic tests like 3d mark where
there's almost no difference we can look
at real world game tests like grid where
there's almost no difference or
assassin's creed where there's a huge
difference and we're left with a very
simple answer whether the 4 gigabyte
card is worth it for you versus the 2
gigabyte card depends it entirely
depends on what games you're playing and
what you hope to do with the video card
higher resolutions will see a more
noticeable gain for different games and
in that respect to be playing 1440 you
should probably consider a 4 gigabyte
solution whether or not it's the 960 you
should be looking at something maybe
higher than 2 gigabytes regardless 4k
you're probably not going to play into
regularly on the 960 it is possible with
some games it's kind of possible with
things like City skylines but really
nothing like Assassin's Creed unity
don't expect to play that at 4k
regardless of the amount of memory on
any 960 beyond this the 9 64 gigabyte
model
is $240 so it does enter some of the AMD
price territory where there are very
competitively priced cards available and
it's not too far away from a 970 so you
do need to consider those options but I
will leave that part of the argument up
to you it is up to you to decide whether
you want to consider some of the other
devices and we've reviewed almost all of
them on the channel at this point
ultimately at the end of the day for
gigabyte 960 video cards do have a
noticeable substantial advantage in
framerate for some games that said other
games either because they use less
memory or they're better optimized will
see effectively zero advantage from the
memory increase so keep all these charts
in mind when buying the card determine
if it's right for you or not if you're
still confused leave a comment on our
forums we check those much more
regularly than the YouTube comments
