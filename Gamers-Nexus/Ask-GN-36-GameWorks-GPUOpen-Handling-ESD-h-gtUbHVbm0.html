episode of ask GN as always before we
get started if you've got questions post
them in the comments section below had a
couple repeat questions from previous
episodes finally we'll be getting to
those today so we've got some
interesting stuff on SSDs on GPUs open
jeep you open and gameworks things like
that before we get into that this
content this week is brought to you by
the a.m the RX 470 and 480 cards which
can be had for under 200 depending on
where you're looking right now because
cyber monday and black friday and of
course regardless of when those this
video is posted those deals i'm sure
will continue basically forever because
that's what retailers do now it's it's
not black friday it's black november as
you well know if you've been to newegg
they actually call it that so without
further ado the first question is from
ghulam fifth alam five who says see why
they're noticeable real-world benefits
to using m2 SSD is like the intel 600 p
which by the way we just included in one
of our buyers guides or sounds on 860
evo over conventional say 23 SSD is like
even shorter boot or load times or are
there insane insane numbers from m 2
drives being bottlenecked by other stuff
like software CP GPU first part of the
question obviously and i'm sure this is
clear for the most part but m dot 2
drives do have the benefit of they can
be used in places where satan might not
be like a smaller system but ignoring
that and looking just at the speed part
of the question it depends so for boot
times i am reventon a bunch of SSDs
including i'm about to drive so i'll be
doing boot time measurements i don't
have an answer for you right now if it's
actually noticeable if anything it's a
couple seconds because boot times are
already so fast that yeah you will be
bottlenecked at some level by things
like windows ability to sort itself out
and then just in bios alone whatever
your settings are there you can enable
things like fastboot get rid of the
usual posts kind of delay that you have
and things like that get rid of the
splash screens but those will be
limiters almost more
some extent than the SSD depend on what
SSD you're using but as far as the other
tests games will be limited by a couple
of things mostly the game and its engine
that is programming so those can only
really load so fast most the time I
don't really even with a hard drive like
I can't remember what games we tested
last time we did the an SSD review but
for the most part the loading times
between levels was pretty minimal now
there are a couple of exceptions to this
like Battlefield one which and I think
battlefront make sense same engine I
think those two games actually load
noticeably quicker with an SSD so we
used like a hyperx predator SSD which is
an m2 a I see so it's an m dot to as is
DM on an add-in card for PCI Express I
use that back then for that testing then
also used traditional hard drive for
another test system and it was actually
noticeably quicker with the load times
so there are instances where an SSD at
all makes a difference whether or not
you see it with m dot tubers aceite i
would say those differences are almost
entirely relegated to things like
production workloads where if you're
whatever you're doing is capable of
writing say upwards of two gigabytes per
second because there's no bottlenecks
anywhere in the system like maybe for
example if you're executing a script to
do mass file transfers where there's no
encode decode or transcoding involved
and it's it's just basically moving
stuff then yeah you'd see a difference
there because the sequential times
especially the reads are so much faster
on some of those m dot two drives but I
you'll be limited for games by plenty of
other things in the system where I don't
think you'll see a huge difference in
loading times that said they come back
in a week or two because i'll be
visiting that topic more thoroughly and
actually have some test data for you
that i can provide to give more actual
numbers about the differences and not
just say isn't noticeable or is it not
noticeable but in general the use case
the main use case if you set out to buy
and i'm about to drive or an nbme
enabled drive you are primarily looking
at
things like am i limited by the physical
layout of my system can I fit a SATA SSD
in there if it's 2.5 inch and there are
SE 2dr it'sit's again I'll talk about
this in the future but there's SATA
enabled m dot two PCIe lanes are split
off depending on nvme versus Zeta
interface and stuff like that all
dictated kind of by the HSI Oh set up on
your chipset or by dictated by the drive
itself talking about that soon basically
the answer is not really huge difference
unless you're doing production things
with mass file movement or a lot of
really fast right times from whatever
your production environment is in those
cases you'll see a difference for things
like capture server for example we've
set up a capture server for things like
fcat we're live captures the gameplay
and records it that's an instance where
you would want rate SSDs if you're
running off of SATA or something like an
Intel 750 series nvme drive which is
what i'm using for our capture server
because anything short of that is not
necessarily fast enough and you start to
lose data and that's bad but that's a
really specific use case that's a kind
of reviewer use case that gives you an
idea though next question tech Pascal
asks I was wondering if you can explain
in greater detail overclocking processes
and what they mean as far as power
target memory offset voltage etc also
what's the process you go through reach
overclock so for specific architectures
we've got videos and articles about how
to overclock Maxwell Pascal and Polaris
so you can check those content pieces
for that to very briefly go over this
the question about a power target so
power target setting is basically you
have a GPU it says maybe the instance of
higher on GP it says something like I
want 180 watts and that's at a hundred
percent of the power target and that if
you offset that normally you get twenty
to thirty percent offset depend on what
it is
is AMD GPUs some of them do fifty
percent offset within the same GPU from
different vendors you might get twenty
or thirty percent offset the reason that
is is because the percentage as always
is kind of a little bit deceptive
because it's with gigabyte for instance
the extreme water card that reviewed the
1080 I think technically has a higher
percentage offset than ebj is hybrid but
the base wattage is lower as well so it
comes out to be about the same if once
you account for that but that percentage
offset basically says if we're drawing a
hundred watts now we offset it an
additional 20 watts now you can draw 120
watts so you've got more power Headroom
for the clock so with NVIDIA and with
AMD basically you're looking at a my
thermally limited no okay so we'll push
the clock okay so now let's check again
am i limited by power no not really as
then next check and we limited by
voltage yes okay so then the user can do
a voltage offset you've got really
limited playroom with that for current
GPUs that are out there you only get so
much in terms of millivolts offset and
GPUs three point I was a little bit
strange with it it's kind of hard to
work with but basically the the question
is power target gives you more power
Headroom which allows you to increase
the clock rate of the card which gives
you of course the higher FPS to some
extent and then does increase thermals
though it also increases clock rate
stability because if you've got let's
say an offset power target but you
haven't touched your GPU clock rate now
there's some room where if the GP runs
into a scenario where it becomes power
limited normally under one hundred
percent offset or what sorry one hundred
percent power target it would throttle
the clock back temporarily until it
regains its footing so to speak whereas
if you offset the power target and you
have extra Headroom but you've not
overclocked now you can sustain that
boost clock basically at a flat level if
you were to plot it over time and that's
beneficial for reducing things like the
occasional stutter in your gameplay and
things like that
I think that answers the basics though
next question is from a poor of galata
says hey Steve I want to ask if desktop
replacements like the acer predator 21x
really makes sense i mean battery life
will be laughable so what exactly makes
them viable yeah so the battery life is
not great on any of cyber powers units
we've looked at things like that you
might get kind of best-case scenario if
it's a single GPU like an hour gaming
which is not great but then it's also
not great battery just for normal use
either because the nature of having
higher end a hardware bigger screen that
demands more power things like that but
or higher resolution but i guess the
tiny use cases are first of all these
are all for the most part either lost
leaders or halo products so non sa meant
to be how a company makes its money it's
more of like let's get eyes on our
company and then just like with the
corsair obsidian series cases like the
900 d not a ton of people buy that
that's really meant to be more of a halo
product and the idea is that people who
see the 900d are like this is a really
high quality case so then they recommend
whatever's below it that's the same idea
with the laptops now as far as usability
the use cases for these desktop
replacements are basically are you a
person who commutes between work and
home and you need your own system in
both locations if so and if it needs to
be a high-end system then you get one of
these and you plug it into a dock on the
other side and you use it as a desktop
the question is well why would you use
that why would you need that much power
if you're doing something like rendering
like we do we need effectively desktop
replacements for when we're traveling to
conventions to render the videos out
fast enough and with whatever filters we
want to apply it's really just not
possible on smaller laptops for the most
part what's the speed that we need but
that systems basically plugged into a
wall one hundred percent of the time so
it's okay it's just not super mobile so
the market is is again basically
production or strange use cases may
you something like is someone who's
moving around frequently between two or
more locations where they live or work
that's basically it but they aren't
really meant to be kind of the main way
for a company to make money next
question n 3 is any 5 saying how to
ground yourself when working on a build
I heard that you can touch the power
supply grill to do that but does it have
to be plugged in turned on also how do
you use an anti-static wrist bracelet do
you attached any metal surface or to a
PC plugged in I have one of those so the
setup we have is a little more elaborate
than you necessarily need but the way I
do it we've got an antistatic mat not
necessary but this plugs into the mat
and that will handle any ESD basically
from whoever's wearing it dissipated
through the surface rather than to into
devices and then for it to actually work
properly it's got to go somewhere
obviously so this is just a metal hook
it's just a circle that goes around to
ground pin in our case on anything that
plugs into a wall so the way I do it for
anti-static bracelets is you've got two
main modes normally you'll buy them like
the roseville ones for a couple bucks
you buy them they'll often have an
alligator clip at the end of it and you
can actually pull those off it's not
going to hurt anything and then this is
under it which is a banana plug it's
called you can plug those into special
banana plug outlets in a wall so you can
buy and basically an adapter for your
normal wall outlet and plug this
straight into it and you connect this to
a bracelet on the other end that's one
option another option is you get
something like we've got set up where
you have the loop at then the metal loop
this hooks around the ground pin in the
US at least that's going to be the third
pin the large circular one hooks onto
that and then you plug that into the
wall and anything that would be coming
off of me through the wrist bracelet
would go basically down the cable into
the wall into Earth and be gone
so that's how we deal with it and you
you can do it kind of you can kind of
hack an ESD solution one option I did
previously did a video on was taking a
power cable like a standard power spy
power cable and you just basically cut
the head off one end clip the hot wires
and leave the ground wire that strip the
housing off of it leave it exposed
copper then clamp into that that would
be a way to hack it and be successful
you can kind of touch a metal surface um
it becomes a bit questionable how
effective that is so one it's if you're
touching something like a power supplier
case it's got to have a path to ground
so ideally you're plugged in with the
power supply not on because you don't
want it on your building but then
there's issues with like for instance
paint paint is really not a great
interface to have between you and your
means of grounding it'll probably work
ok but some of that might just be
because you've not encountered a
scenario where ESD was an issue so hard
to say how effective that is but that
would be my backup yeah clip into the
power supply grill plug it into a wall
and then you should probably be ok but
these solutions are a bit more effective
and some of them aren't too expensive
this next question I'm not going to
answer but I wanted to point it out so
it's from ill to xbox who said basically
asked about are there any games that use
GPU acceleration for character AI if not
is it something Deb's can do in the
future if I understand correctly ai and
machine learning algorithms can
generally benefit a lot from using a GPU
basically parallels amount of GPU I
agree it's really interesting question
so I emailed that out too and the in 10
video and we'll see if I get an answer
and if so i'll address it next week but
i do not know that's that's out of my
area of expertise next question is from
mike smith who says how long do heat
pipe
last I've had one for three years or
more three different rigs now still
working well so basically forever
heatpipe coolers don't really die the
not like liquid coolers they do have
liquid basically liquid in the heat
pipes but that's a sealed system so
unless it's encountered some damage that
liquid is not going to escape anytime
soon because it's designed to sort of
evaporate and then use capillary action
come back down so it's not getting out
of there but yeah they basically last
forever the only thing you're going to
replace is the fan that's a cheap
replacement next question orvis 25 he
says hey Steve second time asking can
you explain GPU open AMD and gameworks
Nvidia specifically what the differences
are and what they do and why game works
is still used far more than GPU open and
games specifically when GPU open is free
and open source game works is also free
and video doesn't charge for that so
I'll briefly do this we talk if you want
GPU open stuff I do have a pretty long
interview with Raja Kaduri on the
channel you can watch that he explains
it pretty well just search GPU open one
word and that interview will come up he
does of course a better job explaining
it than I can in a short amount of time
because that's what he does but to get
the basics here question was why isn't
GPU open used as much even though it's
free and open source again both are free
the GP opens pretty new relatively
gameworks game works in its current form
has been around a little while but also
was preceded by individual effectively
plugins it wasn't always the game works
sdk it was individual stuff it's all
kind of unpackaged into one now so let's
do a stick game works first game works
is effectively a collection of libraries
that developers can pick and choose and
plug into their engine or game so an
instance of use might be if I'm a
developer and I say I want some fire
effects that are pre-calculated
pre-written maybe it's dynamic fire that
spread to something like that and also I
don't want to write it
myself because that's too time-consuming
too expensive too hard in that case
you'd go pull the nvidia gameworks sdk
sdk and the library for fire and plug it
in and it's mostly done you do some fine
tuning things like that and Nvidia and
AMD both have engineers available to
developers to help with that sort of
thing and optimization another option
would be same idea but for fur or hair
like what the witcher did and obviously
these plugins these libraries are going
to be optimized for nvidia hardware and
video made it they're certainly not
going to optimize on behalf of their
competitor and they're probably going to
build in a way that would work well on
their hardware and maybe that doesn't
work so well on their competitors
hardware again tessellation with hair
works in the witcher 3 at least natively
at launch anyway so that's kind of the
basics now the next question what about
GPU open GPU open does it's it's a bit
more things it does kind of the same
thing at a top level which is a
collection of libraries that can be used
to better effect in a game but also GPU
open is trying to sort of collate and
these knowledge at least into more
accessible package for developers to get
to an implement in the games and what i
mean by that is AMD and nvidia have very
specific knowledge and how to optimize
drivers and games to interact with their
hardware and this is done constantly
this is why you can see improvements
twenty or thirty percent sometimes with
drivers because the developer doesn't
necessarily know i'm working with this
particular particle effect or fire
effect or whatever it should be drawn
this way with this video card they don't
necessarily know that or optimized for
it and that's what the two companies
will do the vendors now with the new api
is that's sort of going away so this
driver layer is becoming very thin as
the GPUs interface more directly with
the software so you've got several
abstraction layers removed still a
couple on there like the compilers
making sure the code is all legal
there's not as much driver interaction
as there used to be so GP open is trying
to go out and inform developers how to
optimize their games properly without
relying necessarily on a third party
package like a driver so that's kind of
a newer effort and again the interview
with Raja kind of answers the rest of
that but I think that gives you a
starting point at least as to what each
does and so I have to say either is
better or worse than the other but
that's what they do most we have here
very quickly i'll answer this because
i've answered it so d to ricky said why
aren't we seen huge gains in dx12 out of
the top end of dx12 GPUs so much a draw
call api test is this due to the
majority testing on super high-end
hardware or more testing is being done
at higher resolutions now we've tested
both it's basically that DX I've said
this several times I think most recently
in the battlefield one CPU or GPU
benchmark if you're curious the articles
might give you more on that but to very
quickly recap directx 12 and Vulcan are
not free performance gimmies for the
developers it's not let's plug into DX
12 and we get free performance with the
CPU pulling draw calls or draw calls
being pulled from the cpu to the GPU
that's not really quite how it works
they have to do a lot of low-level
optimization they have to build
specifically for their effects their
processing their job management within
the engine so it's not a free gain and a
lot of the time at least earlier with
the x12 what you end up with is what's
called a rapper so it's a Direct X 12
rapper it's not actually doing anything
at a low level it just calls the dx12
API so it looked like dx12 to the user
but performance might actually be
slightly worse than the x11 or opengl
and that's why with early testing you
saw negative scaling because it wasn't
actually built for the API not ground up
anyway and it's just being wrapped and
it's basically executing it another API
or at last not quite as low level on the
hardware as you would hope
for one of those low-level api's so that
pretty much that answer is really mostly
questions one from last week and I a
message to Michael Kern's one of our
writers back because he's an expert in
keyboards a bit more than I am question
was from Bassam BOTS hereof he said
basically was asking got my hands on
g610 orion brown keyboard i haven't had
any mechanical keyboards my possession
before so i really had high hopes for
this one to put it mildly I was
disappointed the keys felt mushy almost
an attack how about modifiers were loud
felt more like a membrane and keyboard
to me I trade tried razer blackwidow
before and those were satisfying the
press and I asked Michael Kern's what he
thought he said quote okay so it sounds
like you don't like cherry MX Browns ie
you don't like light tactile switches a
decent amount of people myself included
don't on the other hand you like like
clicky switches like the cherry MX blue
or razor green clears and ergo clears
now yeah there's decent of people who
like uh what am I reading here there's a
decent amount of people like you and
what a lot of people like cherry emma is
cherry MX clears and ergo clears thank
you Michael for spell checking this for
me that says MX clears are so much stiff
in that they take more force than cherry
MX Browns or razor greens but ergo
clears Ahmad and he's got a link to that
desk Authority net will have the mod for
her go clears are like cherry MX Browns
what you used but with a more pronounced
bump so you may like them more i would
suggest trying amex clears as they are
somewhat easy to find in keyboards and
while ago clears maybe a bit better for
you they aren't easy to find and require
hand customization generally so there's
your answer to that as always if you've
got more questions anyone post them in
the comments below thanks for watching
page on like a post your videos
subscribe for more i'll see you all next
time
