news recap this one the first video that
we filmed in our new space the first non
moving vlog video for this week's
hardware news we have Lenovo listing the
2006 r3 and R 5 CPUs AGV 104 GPU listed
on a 264 for one of their updates and
TSM sees fabrication plans being hit
with a PC virus that actually impacted
production before that this video is
brought to you by thermal takes view 37
case the vo 37 focuses on highlighting
custom PC builds with its full panoramic
window and tinted front acrylic in our
thermal testing the view 37 performed
reasonably well when considering its
looks focused build which is partly
thanks to the airflow design and the
removal of a bottom power supply shroud
for a balance of looks and performance
check the link in the description below
for the view 37 so first bit of news is
us we are now in the new studio we have
a whole moving vlog series it's still
going on as we continue to add to the
space and improve upon it and this is
the first video we're shooting here we
have a lot of work to do this was built
like fewer than 24 hours ago the wall
behind me and we'll be talking about it
more in the moving vlog series if you're
curious but otherwise there are other
things to talk about for this week like
our products we've restocked all the
stuff on the store the glass is coming
very soon if you've been interested in
those otherwise the mod mats and the
posters are all there if you're
interested store dock gamers X is
thought net for those first news item so
8 is 64 the very popular monitoring and
stress testing software has listed an
Nvidia GB 104 as the gtx 1180 the naming
of and videos new GPUs have been up for
major debate it's not really clear
whether it's 1100 or 2000 series also
doesn't really matter but either way GB
is the demarcation for Volta and if this
listing is to be believed as legitimate
and not just because they were testing
something then final wires release of
the new beta version of a 264 indicates
support for a few new NVIDIA GPUs and
those include GV 102 g v 102 g l GV 104
and GB 104 m
additionally looking at device ID is
that the device ID one e87 lists the GV
104 as the rumored gtx 1180 as for how
consequential this is not really we know
that there are going to be new GPUs and
the name doesn't really matter a whole
lot at this time none of this shows us
anything about the specs we don't know
the performance there's no leaf
benchmarks other than what's already
been out there so this is not new in
that regard at all it's just naming and
the literal GPU ID GV 104 or whatever it
may be so if that holds then I guess we
have some ideas and possible names but
otherwise that's really all it is right
now lenovo has revealed there are 3 and
r5 series cpu containing devices
desktops laptops so forth and the new
ones are the 2000 series so 2000 series
came out several months ago at this
point but we never got the r3 and the r5
was kind of limited so their new reveals
whether intentional or not show
specifications are and these unreleased
r3 2300 X and there are 5 2500 acts in
new documents before there ThinkCentre
m73 small form-factor platform these new
CPUs are successors to the r3 1300 X for
example and the r5 1500 X which we were
never particularly fond of given the
alternative 1600 which was significantly
better not that much more money but
these are based on Andes 12 nanometers
n+ configuration so they should bring
all the same improvements that AMD has
brought forward for rise in 2000 C's
that would include things like better
power management lower latency 'z in
some areas and also significantly better
memory configurations on motherboards a
lot of that is platform side whereby OS
and firmware have improved significantly
since the initial launch so that's what
we know from them it's looking like r3
2,300 x and r5 2500 x not too far out at
this point given lenovo is accidental
leaks or potentially accidental looking
at the specs though from lenovo based
frequency is up about 100 megahertz with
boost frequencies up a notable 300
megahertz DRAM support is also increased
to ddr4 2930
three the same we saw with threader four
to make sense same move to Zen plus and
it's up from ddr4 2667 officially so you
can clock higher than that it's just
that the official JEDEC support is now
twenty nine thirty three so that's a
good move for and these upcoming
processors tsmc fabrication plant was
hit with a virus this is actually pretty
significant news and it's interesting at
that digit Times reported that the
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company halted production to clear
manufacturing systems of a wanna cry
variance of the virus that went around a
while ago now the impact of production
will set tsmc back about two percent in
quarterly revenue if 2 percent doesn't
sound high cue in mind the amount of
volume they do means that 2 percent of
its quarterly revenue equates about a
hundred and seventy million dollars in
downtime as a result of this wanna cry
variant that affected their fabrication
their systems attached to fabrication
machines and fabrication technology so
big hit therefore TSMC from something
that is kind of unexpected for a fab
plant AMD the nineteen second Jennifer
we had a whole video on this you
probably already know most the specs if
you haven't seen it check it out
we had a topological diagram showing the
dye configuration where the
interconnects are which dyes are active
for threader for to for the higher core
count 32 core CPU and for the lower core
count ones as well but just to catch
everyone up the availability and prices
were announced this week threader for 2
is based on 12 nanometers n plus as well
just like the R 3 was 4 mm series and it
brings the same improvements for the
most part that we saw with other 2000
series chips won't go over those again
but one of them is a better volt
frequency curve where you can sustain in
significant ways the same given
frequency at a lower voltage than you
could with rise in 1000 or threader per
1000 this is much needed because thread
refer to being higher core account will
be higher power consumption and so
having that improved volt frequency
curve where you can drop the voltage for
a higher frequency than previously will
enable them to make some trade-offs
without actually really losing much so
that's that's kind of a recap what we
already talked about with our threader 4
2 news post
also JEDEC speeds 29:33 precision boost
to and xfr to also available so for more
information for topology prices launch
dates see our article below or the
previous video Samsung's consumer qlc
SSD is next in the news we talk about
SSD technology every now and then
Samsung has been producing their first
consumer oriented four terabytes qlc
SATA based SSD qlc has been the
preeminent topic in NAND news lately
with micron Intel WD and Toshiba all
announcing their own qlc NAND or qlc
products Samsung's qlc SSD will use 64
layer one terabyte NAND with alleged
performance similar to that of their TLC
NAND somewhat significant here to begin
Samsung will offer one terabyte 2
terabyte and 4 terabyte options of this
of these SSDs based on this technology
and m2 drives are slated for a later
date if interested in those he'll seen
and is promising to bring lower prices
per gigabyte over TLC and Amal see this
is kind of just how it works you're
looking at voltage states per cell
basically and we have a video on how
NAND works if you're curious with all
these acronyms mean search the channel
for how it works and you should find it
but more or less when you expand the
amount of voltage states you have in a
given cell there is a potential
endurance it but it's at the increase of
gigabytes per dollar so to speak so
you're paying less money because you can
fit more in a given area than you could
with something like mlc or especially
SLC but the endurance goes down as a
result because you're pinning that that
sector more or I should say that sell
more when looking for your data so
keelson and is promising those lower
prices for price per gigabyte layout and
they are a means bring down the cost of
terabyte SSDs pushing hard drives
further out of the client storage space
next up pc hardware and many materials
relating to the manufacturing of
semiconductors or semiconductor
equipment is set to raise and cost as
much as 25 percent by the end of august
the current administration in the u.s.
is set to levy new tariffs totaling
sixteen billion dollars worth of imports
going into effect by august 23rd
this marks the second time the US has
ignored warnings from the likes of the
House of Representatives and the
semiconductor industry association
unilaterally slapping tariffs against
China and further escalating the
us-china trade war if you're interested
in this it's looking like it will
actually if this all goes through impact
the price of PC components origin PC has
spoken about this there are an SI based
in the US and have noted that they have
concerns about increasing prices as a
result of the tariffs we have in our
show notes linked below a link to the
all the products affected by the new
tariffs if you're interested or curious
about what specifically might have price
changes for us as consumers and then
another item here this one pretty
interesting NZXT pushing its game themed
custom cases they did this with pub G
recently and had a new pub G case we can
show that on the screen at some point so
the pub G case was the start of NZXT t's
push to custom paint existing lines like
the H 700 in this case there's a new
nuka-cola themed case and also
motherboards theme to nuka-cola after
the Fallout series which is times very
suspiciously for the new Fallout game
being recently discussed and this has a
motherboard with matching theme as well
available separately the case is extra
it's 300 bucks so it's quite a bit over
the stock 8 700 but it does have a
limited quantity custom paint theme if
you're really into fallout the
motherboard covers are available for an
extra $50 but are only compatible with
the NZXT and 7 motherboard so this isn't
functional it's not really a new product
but we found the effort to make cases
actually customized in a different way
for once worth talking about and
hopefully this is something that can be
managed in terms of price and they can
expand their licensing capabilities for
popular games the flash memory summit
took place this past week and there were
of course many announcements emanated
from the event well mention a couple of
the more notable ones that'll be more
likely to infiltrate the market and not
be limited to just data centers or
Enterprise Toshiba's 3d exile flash is
one example of those newer technologies
Toshiba announced their 3d exile flash
and what appears to be a response to
Intel's obtained 3d crosspoint
and Samsung's Zenith
so she was 3d Excel flash uses Toshiba's
existing SLC flash and uses shorter bit
lines and word lines and toshiba's new
flashes aimed at high performance and
low latency at the expense of capacity
as such Toshiba intends to use a flash
as a high-performing caching option
alongside its forthcoming TLC products
and potentially replacing DRAM on a hard
drives SK Hynix had an announcement as
well with four dean and sk hynix have
named their new flash technology as 4d
and which is a bit misleading Hynix
isn't adding a fourth dimension to their
hands chips but is instead using a
combination of CTF and puck no not that
one not the NZXT puck these are the
charge trap flash and periphery
undersell to reduce die size CTF and
puck can be combined which also
increases density and reduces cost while
maintaining competitiveness SK Hynix
intends to sample the first gen 14 and
in q4 2018 in the form of 96 layered TLC
one terabit dies
additionally SK Hynix is readying their
4d and four qlc as well slated for 2019
finally for hardware sales for the week
we saw EVGA GTX 1080 ftw2 at time of
variety and available for about four
hundred thirty bucks
we've also regularly been seen 1080s hit
sale prices of 472 480 which is a bit
lower than they were supposed to be
several months ago this is obviously
before what many our suggestion at this
point could be a GPU launch so based on
all the rumor articles we've seen it
makes sense that these the GPU prices
are finally dropping back to roughly
where they should have been for a year
now of course there's k70 luxe RGB is
also on sale for about 110 bucks
amazon's list price often not fully
accurate to reality at 160 so that's
potentially dropped if you're interested
in that one Corsair has a vs 550 and
this is a 550 watt power supply at time
of writing and filming it's available
for about $20 post rebate if your answer
rebates not the best but for budget
builders you could do worse for $20
certainly and finally Trident Z's RGB 16
gigabyte 36
megahertz memory given the ongoing
market for DRAM and the climate of DRAM
isn't a terrible deal either it's still
wildly over price just less so than
usually this kits been signed for around
230 but it's currently 185 so that's it
for this week as always links in the
