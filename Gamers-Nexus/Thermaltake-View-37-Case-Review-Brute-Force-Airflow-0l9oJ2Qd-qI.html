back-to-back cases with origins that are
of questionable airflow this is think
they'll take view 37 we've previously
looked at the thermal take view 71 they
have some similarities one of the
primary ones is the fan orientation each
case the view 71 previously and now the
37 have to rain fans in them for the
stock non RGB configuration and that has
them positioned bottom front and top
rear now somewhat shockingly into us the
view 71 actually did pretty damn well
and a lot of that was because of the
rest of the case so for that case
although it was tempered glass
everywhere there were gaps in the
paneling all over the place and also no
power supply shroud this one has one of
those features it's got no power supply
shroud which always tends to help with
GPU thermals but it does actually lack
the gap effect of the view 71 and that's
because it has what Thermaltake I
believe calls a panoramic panel which is
this side acrylic panel here that covers
the entire enclosure for the top and the
side and you lose one structural bar on
the top but that's for the open glass
view so we're gonna be reviewing this
one today before that this video is
brought to you by thermal Grizzly makers
of the conductor not liquid metal that
we recently used to drop 20 degrees off
of our coffee leak temperatures thermal
grizzly also makes traditional thermal
compounds we use on top of the IHS like
cryo not and hydro not pastes learn more
at the link below we generally try not
to have too many expectations going into
a products review but you can't help
building some of them based on previous
testing experience looking at this case
the instant reminder we got was aged 500
P and that's because the front is
completely closed off and you've got a
ventilation panel on the side basically
some small vents on either side then it
closed off front basically h 500 p so
you go into it expecting maybe not the
best thermals but we'll see how it does
because the view 71 did pretty well with
this configuration they use very
different fans and different layouts
internally over all the models of this
case include the $110 version that we
have here which is two fans 140 ring
non RGB fans and a $170 alternative
which has two RGB rain fans in the front
but get into it so the layouts pretty
straightforward you can mount fans in
the front 140s 120 s and even 200 s
which we did test by the way we'll have
thermals on that in a bit and if you
mounted 200 s in the front you can
technically install those inside the
chassis which is something you could not
do with aged 500 P however there's one
big downside to that and that's if you
install them internally you lose
basically the entire outer edge of any
LEDs you might have and because thermal
take when they show their marketing
images of this case with the 200 mounted
externally on the outside of the chassis
bars that's how we ended up testing it
so if you do mount it that way what you
end up with is fans that are pushed
right up against the acrylic and we'll
see how that goes in thermal testing but
that's something we've talked about in
the past for the rest of it there is
technically the option to mount a
radiator against the wall of the case
towards the front above the hard drive
cages which are located down on the
bottom front and if you were to do that
you could push the air or pull it either
way out the other side panel the right
side panel from your perspective so
that's I mean it's it's good that they
actually have ventilation on this side
over here because not every case that
has mounting support for radiators
vertically will do that surprisingly
enough so they've done well there with
something very basic but yeah you can
mount radiator there radio in the front
it just Thermaltake after all they do
liquid cooling vertical GP is an option
it's positioned somewhat significantly
further back from the glass or the
acrylic panel then typically but you're
still gonna run into thermal issues with
an open-faced cooled card as a person
open-loop card which would not have
those issues no power supply shroud as
noted and let's get the side panel off
this is the next next endeavor it'll
take a moment so we'll just speed up the
footage
so the point of that like with the
coarser one is to show that it takes
wild take off now they do actually have
a good reason for that panel the
mounting mechanism I like a lot so it
slides out on rails like this and you
just pull out and pretty straightforward
acrylic panel but the reason that it
takes so many screws to get the thing
off is because as you might expect
you're lacking a structural support beam
here so when that panel is on and this
isn't in there which it was not during
CES it's been added it's got four screws
and it goes over the back corner right
there without that in there and the
extra four screws if you apply some
torque like some torsional force to the
chassis it can actually somewhat bend
and warp in a way that you lose contact
between the acrylic side panel and the
front in the back fortunately they've
got the extra screws in there it still
is a bit structurally weak on that
corner I mean you can certainly flex it
is that relevant probably not so much
however it is a quality perceived
quality difference that isn't great but
also you can't do a whole lot about it
the only thing that I can think of would
be perhaps a triangular arm up here that
comes down and braces against the top
corner of the case and braces against
this wall but then you run into fan
clearance issues as well so what they've
done is better than what I could come up
with given the parameters that are in
this situation if you want full support
for everything you're not going to be
able to have extra structure or support
beams there without either adding an
ugly bar here adding ugly bars there
that block some fan ports so that's the
only note on structural and build
quality that's really a negative is that
there there is some flexing and bowing
and basically what it comes down to is
when you're done with the build you put
the system on the ground just apply some
light pop force on the sides to make
sure that the panels are all flush and
you don't have air gaps so it's a bit
inconvenient to get the panel off but
not a huge deal it's just something
we've been complaining about a lot
lately either way though we'd rather
have the extra screws than not in this
case a couple of other points here
before going through thermals and some
of Patrick's build notes first of all
externally this is a bit odd the bottom
here comes almost all the way down to
the table there's this very limited
amount of clearance less weight less
than an inch and the result is mounting
a fan in the bottom although it will
somewhat help the video card you're
fighting against basically the power
supply because there's no real place for
a fan although you can put one there
there's no place for a fan in the bottom
to really pull air through because it's
got a either fight against this side
skirt which leaves you fractions of an
inch to breathe or more realistically
you're fighting up the power supply
which is mounted here and is pulling in
its own air so the only real place to
breathe is in the back where there's
about an inch of height from the ground
and so that's where most your air is
coming in but there's also power supply
fan back there to consider so they do
have a full length dust filter which is
nice it's got very thick bars on it
sub-optimal for cooling but not that
relevant because ultimately the power
supply is not going to care that much
and mounting a fan in the bottom is
inadvisable anyway but that's your dust
filter it's a little bit annoying to put
back in not a huge deal sometimes it
kind of requires tilting the case to get
it lined up right but it'll eventually
go in there so that's most of the case
I'm gonna go through some of Patrick's
building notes now he had hands-on with
it pretty extensively and then we'll go
through the thermal and noise testing so
a couple of things here removing or
replacing the bottom front stock fan is
somewhat of a pain the front panel and
both side panels must be removed the
hard drive tray near it must be removed
to reveal the screws on the back of the
hard drive cage four screws must be
removed to release the cage for further
screws that can then be removed from the
cage mount and allow extra screwdriver
room and
the fan can be unscrewed from the case
so it's a lot of steps to get a fan out
we'd like to see removable fan trays
like the 500 D head and a couple of
other cases recently or a more easily
removable hard drive cage at least it's
not riveted but we feel like this is
something that Thermaltake could
relatively easily improve and it would
improve the ease of installation a lot
talking about a whole bunch of extra
screws versus just a couple if they
added in a removable fan cage or a more
easily removed hard drive cage getting
into the thermal testing before this
next part our standardized case test
bench is on the screen now as sponsored
by Cal mod you can find their cable
extensions linked in the methodology
section of the article if you're curious
let's talk about our thermal testing
configurations we tested the vertical
GPU mount and with the front panel
removed as usual we also tested with to
200 millimeter rain intake fans
installed in the front both with and
without the front panel there's a decent
amount of ventilation on either side of
the front panel but none at the bottom
and obviously none at the top of the
case due to the acrylic window clearance
between the front panel and stock fans
is tight and it's even worse when the
thicker 200 millimeter rains we're added
later clearance could be much better if
the fans were mounted inside the case
again which is actually possible but
doing that with the 200 million fans
would cover up their LEDs and defeat the
whole purpose of having them secondarily
advertisements show the case with 200
millimeter fans mounted to the outside
of the chassis so that's what we tested
with the fans moved inside the chassis
just expect the results to be between
stock and no front panel results no need
to test it separately starting with the
V 237 on the charts with just CPU
temperatures the stock configuration
operates a CV temperature of 54 point 7
degrees Celsius over ambient when using
a single 140 millimeter fan in the
bottom front this fan is mounted in the
bottom front again by default but
there's also a 140 in the top rear like
the view 71 just without the large
airflow gaps and the panels that the
view 71 had removing the stock fan and
replacing it with two ring fans mounted
like thermal takes advertising shows
results in functional equivalent CP
performance there is no uplift from
adding the large fan that's directly in
line with the CPU which points towards
similar front panel suffocation issues
that we saw
originally H 500 P and also just limited
intake vertical GPU mounting reduces
strain on the CPU a bit by moving the
back plates radiative heat away from the
heatsink as we've seen before really the
front panel doesn't improve the stock
configuration much down to 52 degrees
but we can see a change with the to 200
millimeter fans for this configuration
we moved from 54 point 9 degrees over
ambient to forty six point nine degrees
over ambient an improvement about eight
degrees by removing the front panel
quite substantial that gives us an idea
for airflow impedance and again if you
mounted them internally you could expect
somewhere in between those two numbers
we did a quick anemometer spot check for
this again using one of these hot wires
just to better understand the panel
impedance so what we can what's pretty
simple with the vo 37 panel on we
measured air flow of 560 linear feet per
minute versus 940 in our particular
point of measurement with the panel
removed that's a significant change in
performance from a front panel alone and
indicates that some additional mesh
spacing on the sides could help or a cut
out on the top or the bottom if there
can be no cutouts in the front because
they just want it to look the way it
does so a quick note though those
numbers the linear feet per minute
airflow numbers can't be compared to the
other cases or fans we've tested because
we're testing them in different ways
these are spot checks so we're testing
against only the case we're talking
about today it's this case against
itself basically with and without the
panel not comparable to the age 500p
mesh for the comparative CPU charge
comparatively the thermaltake vu 37
performs about equivalently to the view
71 for CPU thermals this makes sense as
both cases distance the CPU far from the
stock intake rear exhaust creates a
natural pressure to pull air in that
direction but we're still running on the
warmer half of this truncated chart the
view of 37 for all of its acrylic and
limited intake performs it not too
distant from the original age 500 P no
big surprise given the similar design
for the front panel the vo 71 was a case
we praised for excellent GPU thermals so
we'll see if the 37 can carry this in
the next few charts for now it's off to
a mediocre if predictable start for
cooling on the CPU for GPU testing the
view 37 stock GP thermals operate at 51
degrees Celsius over
improving to 49 degrees with no front
panel that's not a large movement from
the panel removal and again suggests
limitations on the fan configuration we
would see a larger disparity with more
fans using two 200 millimeter fans
performs at worse than a single 140 fan
despite the cases marketing photos and
initial CES unveil driving a 200
millimeter narrative it's unfortunate as
the reasons for this poor performance
are exactly the same as the aged 500 P
the single 140 is doing fine but two
200s with LEDs visible end up smashed
against acrylic there's no room to
breathe removing the panel gives us some
performance improvement for the 200s
though vertical GPO mounting is as is
often the case best reserved for
open-loop cooling configurations in this
instance we proved that again it's the
problem not unique to thermal tape it's
basically been a trend for the last year
vertically oriented the GPU out breaks
at sixty six point four degrees Celsius
over a means factor in ambient and that
puts us near in ninety degrees Pascal
hard throttles at eighty four so we're
dropping clocks hard here losing frame
rate and we end up with a vertical GP
orientation that's not great for
air-cooled cards but again not unique
the thermal take reserve this for liquid
cooled cards only the upshot though is
that unlike its competitors they're all
take does actually properly accommodate
a taller PCB card while having an air
cooler most the other ones don't have
the clearance for the larger PCBs
comparatively the view 37 actually does
shockingly well for stock GPU cooling
performance when left with a single 140
millimeter fan in the front and one in
the back its stock configuration this is
certainly better than leveraging the
looks oriented 200 millimeter slots in
the case the view 37 manages with its 51
degree readout its place functionally
equivalently to the Corsair 5 70 X and
the view 71 both cases that we actually
liked for their GPU cooling performance
these cases are within margin of error
of the view 37 and similarity to the
view 71 makes sense given the air flow
configuration the vo 37 is also within
margin of error of the stock h 500 p
mesh which we just got done praising for
its significant thermal improvements if
you remember that review the age 500
people are dead zones across from the
200 millimeter and
a fan on the graphics card responsible
for the stack that we're seeing here the
view 37 performed far better than we
expected truth be told that single rain
fan in the front is a good one
better than most stock fans in most
cases and it's positioned in a way that
directly benefits the GPU arguably the
most important element to cool because
the CPUs don't have clock throttling
until much higher temperatures unlike
the more sensitive GPUs which throttle
hold marginally every 5 degrees or so
the result is a mediocre CPU cooling
performance and given the lack of fans
on the top of the same panel that makes
sense but very competitive GPU
performance for what the case is
advertising which just looks a large
part of this performance is the lack of
the PSU shroud on the bottom combined
with a bottom focused airflow power
supply shroud to eat GPU performance by
trapping a lot of warmed air forcing
recirculation into the card in this case
illustrates how much design can change
performance even in spite of fan
configurations the fire strike extreme
workload only raised average GPU
temperature to 52 point seven degrees
roughly equal to the aged 500 beam ash
and only beaten by the PMO one RB 0 2
and 1/2 X that's excellent for a case
like this and really surprising and
given the lack of ventilation but again
it speaks to the quality and positioning
of that single fan in the front with
only one intake fan aiming it along the
bottom of the case it's a good choice to
set it up the way it is rendering our
monkeyhead test image against the cpu
average the CPU temperature of 37 point
2 degrees equivalent to thermal takes
core p3 and view 71 enclosures those
aren't cases with a focus on CV cooling
but they are well ventilated so the view
37 is in good company cases with more
active air flow towards the top like the
RL 0 6 and H 500 ppl perform this one
but it definitely isn't leaving a hot
air trapped around the CPU cooler GPU
accelerated rendering averaged twenty
five point nine degrees celsius delta T
over ambient on the GPU again roughly
equivalent to the view 70 want they're
better cooled cases on the chart but
again they're all cases that we've
specifically praised for their cooling
the Cougar concur RB 0 2 etc while the
view 37 appears to be a sealed acrylic
bubble but still doing reasonably
performance in all these thermal tests
was beyond what we were expecting if
still somewhat moderate the noise level
of the stock view 37 is
it's exactly the same as the view 71 TG
because it has the same fans and the
same layout the 140 millimeter rain fans
stayed at around 1500 rpm during testing
so they were pretty noisy so then we're
left with the reminder that cases or any
product are just as much an amalgamation
of their set of features and quality as
they are their marketing in the instance
of this case the Vue 37 from the
materials that we have pre-launch which
is the new act pages it doesn't look
like thermal takes boasting about
airflow so can't nail them for that one
the airflow is okay the thing is the CPU
does suffer a bit and that's something
we saw the view 71 as well the reason it
suffers is quite obvious the GPU does
pretty well and if you're wondering why
GP cooling can do so well in spite of it
what is a completely closed off front
and we had tests for removing the panel
and you saw the results the reason it's
doing pretty well is because that rate
and fan is actually a real fan there
including decent fans with the case so
you don't need to go out and buy and
replace it it also spins pretty fast and
it's pretty loud as you saw on the noise
chart not terrible but at the full 1400
to 1500 rpm it's certainly a faster fan
than most especially for a 140 that's
where the performance comes from for GPU
cooling and in spite of the front panel
and then the lack of the power splash
shroud is also significant because it
allows the GPU fans to do their own work
without as much impedance as we've seen
in other cases build quality is okay
overall the case has again some
weaknesses right here as you would
expect and applying any kind of
torsional force will cause a bit of a
bowing or warping of the front and the
back panels against the panoramic panel
as it's mounted not a big deal something
they could probably try to improve but
there's not a lot that could be done
without making the thing ugly or
difficult to work with for fans
so overall is there's really not a lot
they could do there whether you like the
panel is completely up to you we're not
going to comment on that it's entirely
subjective but for the rest of the case
there's a ton of Kaila management room I
could fit my entire hand
back there so that's great there's space
as a result behind the motherboard tray
for fans if you wanted to do side
mounted intake or exhaust with a
radiator there's decent liquid coin
support the fan in the front is a little
bit annoying to access not a big deal
ease of installation could be worked on
and improved for this case as we've
noted here and in the written review
links below the rest of the problems are
primarily things we've seen before like
open face cards struggling with a
vertical GPU mount not a surprise to
anyone at this point
and 200 millimeter fans not really
delivering what some might perceive
would be the best performance because
they're just not especially if you mount
them externally as in outside the frame
so that you can see the LEDs they don't
do well and that could be fixed if
they're on take would add some space
here for the mesh or the side intake
which is something we said about the H
500 P as well so they've got avenues and
vectors to improve this case quality
wise it's decent it's I put it at
average in terms of cooling GPU is
actually competitive for wear the case
it's in terms of aesthetics CPUs below
average and noise is below average in
that it's a bit louder and that's
because the fans in here are so fast
they spend fourteen hundred fifty nine
hundred rpm as noted that's gonna be a
bit louder so yeah the basically the
trade-off here is if you want acceptable
cooling performance which is clearly
possible as we've demonstrated you do
have to sacrifice some noise you're
willing to sacrifice on the noise front
and have a bit louder of a system you
can circumvent some of the cooling
impedance that the case naturally
provides if you can't deal with noise
then you basically have to go liquid or
find a different case and there are a
lot of good cases out there so to go
over a couple of them this is 110 bucks
the alternative is 170 if you wanted to
buy fans for this one you buy the $110
one with another blue fan for about 16
dollars and you'd be out well ahead of
the RGB version alternatives the pmo one
is really good we still like that case a
lot it doesn't look like this one does
you lose the panorama
thing if you don't need it it's a really
good case the PMO too disappointed us
275 are disappointed us because neither
of them added anything over their
predecessors and then fractal has the
mesh if I see not-to-distant in price
Corsair has a 400 C not too distant in
price and on the cheaper end the RL 0 6
once again get to mention those are all
cases that we've reasonably liked and
would recommend as competitors to this
one if you didn't like what you saw with
this one there are surprisingly no huge
glaring flaws with thermals really was
expecting the opposite the only huge
glaring flaw with thermals I guess there
is one is the proximity of the front
acrylic to an externally mounted fan and
thermal take if you're watching please
add a little bit of depth on that front
panel so that's not an option because
the 200 fans look great but they don't
perform well because you're smashing
them against glass panel they there's
