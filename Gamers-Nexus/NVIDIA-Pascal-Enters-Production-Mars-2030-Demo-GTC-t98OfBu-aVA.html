keynote from Nvidia's conference and the
main item here to talk about today is a
new VR demo so it's sort of like the
Everest VR demo but the new one is on
Mars so this is Mars 2030 and it's an
eight square kilometer area that uses
photogrammetry from satellite flyovers
to actually build the landscape and this
is somewhat at a top level similar to
what we talked up with the Everest VR
previously and you can read about that
in some of our CES coverage and items
like that but with Mars the demo was
actually showcase by Steve Wozniak so
that did add a bit of humor to the
element we've got the full article below
if you want to read more on that but one
of the main interactions was when at
Steve Wozniak sort of stepped into the
rover and there's actually a rover on
the surface you can either walk around
you can drive around and get it into the
rover has some audio files that were
recorded by Nvidia at NASA headquarters
so they were able to recreate audio more
accurately to what's actually going on
now in terms of other forms of accuracy
within the demo there's a physically
accurate representation of the Mars
rovers wheels and shocks as it moves
around the service so there's a
suspension movement as is appropriate
for different rocks and other terrain
elements and speaking of the rock
specifically I don't know if he was
exaggerated or not but Nvidia CEO Jensen
said that there were a million at rocks
and many of them were handcrafted on the
surface of the Mars 20 30 demo the next
major announcement at the keynote was
the introduction of Pascal Tesla p100 so
that's the first GPU for Pascal that's
being produced on mass and it just
entered volume production so that's the
p100 GPU and it's in the Tesla p100 card
the solution which is not a consumer
solution it's not a geforce product sort
of a super computes ID but just for sake
of reference the new p100 is a 15
billion ish transistor GPU it's got 10.6
teraflops of FP 32 compute more than 20
teraflops of FP 16 making it definitely
very powerful it's the largest GPU that
enmity has ever produced according to
the stage presence here at gtc and that
of course leaves the question of where's
where's geforce where's the stuff that
we care about as gamers and that's not
been announced yet here today we
obviously no Pascal is forthcoming for
gaming hbm 2 is on the Tesla p100 will
probably be on the g4 side as well but
there's currently a pretty large window
for AMD to try and get moving with their
Polaris there na'vi and their viga GPU
architecture that we talked about a GD c
naught t cg DC just a couple weeks ago
so right now it's pretty interesting
time to keep an eye on polaris and na'vi
and then see if Pascal is still going to
hit 4 2016 on the game inside on the g4
side and of course if it will include
hbm to or if they're going to be using
gddr5 x or something similar or both
which is the most likely right now from
what we've looked at previously all this
