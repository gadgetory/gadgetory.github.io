980ti we learned to that better cooling
would provide more thermal Headroom for
clock boosting without the need to blast
fan noise our reviews of the gaming ex
and gigabyte extreme RS cards furthered
that conclusion but also necessitated an
extra $50 spend over MSRP today we're
looking at EVGA GTX 10 ATT is c2 priced
at seven hundred twenty dollars and
using EVGA Zhai CX design that we
exhaustively detailed in our 1080 ftw2
IC x review before that this content is
brought to you by our patreon backers
you can go to patreon.com/scishow selves
out directly which helps us with this
in-depth reporting because it takes
quite a bit of time and that direct
support is necessary you can also go to
store dot gamers nexus dotnet if you
prefer to pick up one of our three new
shirt designs when EVGA launched its icx
design in February we really heavily
detailed it so if you're not familiar
with IC x vs AC X you might want to
check out that previous content we did a
be testing with AC X versus IC X on the
same physical GPU and all that stuff to
figure out what exactly I see X does now
at a very top level to recap every one
IC x this PCB here is equipped with a
couple of thermistor so they are NTC
they're negative type thermistors that
are hooked up to nine different
components on the board including GPU
backside which isn't really all that
useful but gu backside there are a
couple of memory thermistors mounted and
then I believe five power thermistors
mounted these are not mounted within the
die itself or on the package but
basically adjacent and we previously
validated that EVGA thermistors read
about the same as our thermocouples do
when we mount them to the same spot so
they are accurate and they are useful
primarily for determining if the vrm
components or the RAM components are
running at temperatures that make sense
now are they necessary absolutely not
but as we determined in the 1080 FTW to
review the IC XF is innovative and it's
different and that alone is worth notice
but it is just a matter of do you want
an extra toy to play with because it's
not going to improve your game
experience it just gives you more stuff
to look at and play around with which if
you like that fantastic it's worth
looking at other than that functionally
the real advantage of icx is just having
different fan speeds for the fans on the
cooler so the marketing language would
be asynchronous fans which really just
means that the vrm fan and the GPU fan
can spin at different speeds depending
on the temperatures of each the 1080i
models have the thermistors in different
locations from the 1080 models which
means that you cannot directly compare
the two chips for or I should say the
two cards for thermals which is a shame
because it'd be really cool to do but we
can do that anyway with our thermocouple
mounting so we'll have that data
separately now as for the cooling design
this stuff is somewhat simple it's stuff
that we've all seen before but EVGA
iterated on it a bit number one thing
they have gone absolutely mental with
their thermal pad placement they've
definitely over compensated and making
up for the thermal pad incident last
year so you can see all that here in
terms of things that are actually cool
this is the base plate base plates are
not too exciting the fin stack here they
are calling these pin fins
it's just cylindrical fins they are made
out of aluminum they stick out of the
base plate and they are used for helping
to spread heat over a larger surface
area from the memory modules and the
capacitor banks that are located
directly below the fin stack so these
give you more surface area just like the
small bumps over here do how much does
it help hard to say because we cannot do
a/b testing this time because the
mountains a bit different from a CX and
IC x from the 1080 to the 1080 TI so
hard to say exactly how much that helps
but other than that they've added a heat
pipe here which is a bit different so
the heat pipe is a single heat pipe it
looks like it's about a six millimeter
pipe and that connects to a copper plate
so this copper base plate is connected
to the fat so you've got connections
straight to the MOSFETs with this part
of the plate and then the rest of it
connects to the inductors pretty good
coverage overall but we'll test the
thermals roll into that stuff first
methodology as always is defined in the
article
if you don't know our testing methods
you can click that link and check it out
we use thermocouples to help validate
numbers though this board has a
thermistors attached so we don't need as
many of them and yet we can dive into
thermals versus frequency first it helps
to get a feel for the cards baseline
behaviors prior to getting further into
testing so for that we're looking at
frequency versus thermals and time with
the 1080i SETI CX card this helps us
understand how the clock fluctuates
based on temperatures the max clock
range is about 114 megahertz from peak
to dip with temperatures controlled
around 65 C look at individual power
stage and memory temperatures in moment
first let's look at a comparative chart
with competition on the screen our GPU
comparison chart contains over a year of
data at this point and it's gotten
pretty unwieldy so will crop it into
just the stuff we're talking about today
most notably the 1080 t is see too icx
card runs a GPIO temperature of 49 6
Celsius delta T over ambient went under
load which is significantly cooler than
the 1080 TI f e card that's running at
warm at 58 C delta T over ambient I see
X card also manages its temperature at a
lower noise footprint which I'd be
expected given the aftermarket cooler
look at noise in a few minutes and the
msi 1080i gaming X runs at 40 4.3 Scelzi
delta T about 3 Â°c warmer than EVGA
sse2 I see X card a gigabyte extreme
Oris version of the 1080i operates at
about the same temperature as MSI card
making EVGA is 1080i SSC to the coolest
operating gtx 980ti that we've yet
tested with the stock fan profile other
than just the cooling solution the fans
things like that there's another reason
for this so the extreme Oris card is
sinking the vram into the same cold
plate that is connected to the GPU we
talked about this in our extreme or at
review we talked about in the game and
extra view that means that the vram is
getting cooled by the same solution as a
GPU which is great for the vram but your
GPIO temperature will look a bit higher
because you're sinking more heat from
more devices into the same plate and
it's only got so much before it's
reaching up basically a thermal
saturation where you have more heat
going through the same solution so that
drives temperatures up that's part of
the difference the difference is still
favoring EVGA
and the icx sensors as we'll see
momentarily do show that the rest of the
temperatures are just fine even without
that cold plate helping out we've heard
suggestions that the new hole riddled
faceplate could actually benefit the
thermals over previous EVGA faceplate
design since the shroud covers so much
of the cooling area in those older
designs without a compatible shrouds
amounts the card the best way to a/b
test this was to close off the hole so
we pulled our Gavit tape and plugged
them all up to look something like a
Brigantine patchwork video card then we
ran the thermals this will block off air
channels in a similar fashion to filling
the holes with the shroud so we'll
simulate a closed off base plate we're
accounting for ambient fluctuations in
this first chart with a modifier value
based on thermocouple readings of the
intake temperature these tests were
conducted at 50% fan speed to ensure the
fans did not adjust to higher
temperatures between a/v execution we
also ran auto tests and found the same
results but we'll be using the 50% fan
speed numbers for this presentation we
can add GPS diode temperature over time
we can see that our a/b test posts no
real difference between the taped line
represented an orange and the stock line
in blue the temperatures are within one
celsius of each other at all times and
ramp up is a similar pace the tape
version does take a slightly wider arc
to cool down but isn't anything extreme
even idle temperatures are roughly equal
the same is true for memory module
number one as seen in this next chart
idle temperature at the start is about
equal ramp up temperature and time is
roughly equal and steady state
temperature is roughly equal cool down
takes a marginally wider arc again but
achieve the same end result in about the
same amount of time and MOSFET number
five shows the same behavior with a bit
of an anomaly in the first quarter of
the test that's likely just from
modulated load on the power virus if we
switch now it's one of G on the EQ
charts we can see that the tests are all
roughly equal the biggest change we have
is in power five which can be accounted
for in that anomalous spike in our
previous overtime chart that we showed
just a second ago
everything else is within a 1 Celsius
range for the most part if not less and
that is with ambient accounted for like
gigabytes copper insert that we talked
out in the Xtreme RS review this base
plate is largely for looks it's not
necessarily a bad thing but it's really
not going to help with the cooling
design so if you're looking at this base
plate and thank you
it's better for thermals unless you're
pointing a side intake fan straight at
it and you mount the card vertically in
something like I don't know of any cases
beside intake and a vertical GPU mount
but if you get one maybe there would be
a difference but in our testing there's
really no difference that leads not one
to speak of not one that is significant
enough to confidently declare that open
versus closed for these holes is
beneficial or not it is effectively the
same when it is taped off closed or when
it is open and if you were buying this
card based on the faceplate do it
because you like how it looks
not because it's better thermally
because that is not the case so this is
similar to the gigabyte copper backplate
insert that they have that we tested
recently no real difference it's really
just a looks thing we're moving now to
noise testing conducted at twenty inches
away from the system with all passive
components inside aside from the video
card a noise floor of the room is about
26 DBA and the EVGA card runs the same
idle noise as the other cards with a
zero spin fan policy that is it makes no
noise when idle those fans toggle off
when under a 55 Celsius load and spin up
asynchronously based on the load for
each half of the card EVGA is the fault
fan profile seems to auto spin at around
1600 rpm for the left fan and about 1700
rpm for the right then resulting in a
noise output of about 42 DBA or about 3
to 4 decibels louder than the MSI's card
at its auto speed of around 55% and
around 4 to 5 dB a quieter than the
founders vision card as a similar fan
speed EVGA could actually run a much
more conservative fan profile if they
wanted to though they'd sacrifice
thermal performance to some extent at
50% fan speeds for each fan which is
something that almost never happens on
this card the EVGA SC 2 card runs at 40
at 7.6 DBA output all of these GPAs run
at or below 55 percent fan speeds in
real-world scenarios that we've tested
so the 100% value isn't really critical
here it's more of just a validation
thing EVGA does have the fastest fans of
its size which means a louder output
when maxed out completely but you'll
ultimately never really be at 100%
anyway unless you manually tell your
card
on that fast so the thing runs fine when
it's Auto you could go into the fan
profile with EVGA precision and
configure a better one
right now the vrm fan is kicking on at
around 55 C and it spins up fairly
quickly and it doesn't need to spin that
fast because the RM components can take
a hell of a lot more heat than a GPU so
even though a 100 C would look scary on
any other type of component you're used
to really it's not a huge deal for the
VRMs now you don't want to run that high
just because you're producing a lot more
heat in the tight area that's on the PCB
and that starts heating up other
components and you eventually start
derating and losing efficiency but you
could approach 100 C and be ok so the
fat temperatures are actually pretty low
on this thing when you're using the auto
profile that is largely I would guess
because EVGA when they put these ICS
sensors on there they realize that
there's a marketing concern of we are
now giving users who may not necessarily
understand these temperatures a look
into the temperature of power components
and if they start seeing high numbers
they're going to freak out which is a
completely valid concern so if you know
what you're doing at least to some
remote extent if you watched our channel
you could go in there configure a fan
profile for the vrm fan that would be
this one and slow it down a little bit
it doesn't need to run as fast as they
do the temperatures would be fine and
you would lower your noise profile at
which point the EVGA icx cards sc2 would
now compete with a Maasai's gaming X in
both thermals and noise rather than
mostly just in the thermal Dept we're
gonna move on to FPS benchmarking next
so the thin here with these GPUs we've
done a lot of 1080p is now the numbers
are all basically the same that's what
you would expect when you have any GPU
and all you're doing is changing the PCB
in the cooler the benchmark numbers for
gaming it will look mostly the same this
is largely a thermal and noise
comparison so the the game benchmarks
will be more limited in the video if you
want all of them they will be linked in
the article below
that includes Sniper Elite for ashes of
the singularity and maybe one other game
that we won't talk about here along with
3dmark but for now we'll step through
some of the game benchmarks we've got
overclock numbers on our benchmarks here
as well so here's an OC stepping table
that shows the
a spell progress of overclocking the gtx
980ti sc2 you can see where we settled
it towards the bottom of the list of the
last passing numbers but those were a
little bit tight it was unstable in some
scenarios we stepped it back a couple
megahertz and that's where we landed
ultimately starting on our FPS
benchmarks with Ghost Recon wildlands at
4k the EVGA 1080 is see too icx card
runs an average FPS about 59 with 1% low
is at 52 and 48 FPS on the 0.1% level
metrics this ranks the sp2 between the
msi 1080i gaming x stock and the
overclocked values and just behind our
own overclocked natt I found Edition GN
hybrid mod which was a liquid-cooled mod
of the FE card stock performance for all
of these 10 atti cards is more or less
equal with differences primarily in
power limitations and out of box
configuration for the clocks we were
able to overclock the EVGA SC to a bit
higher than the gaming X card that we
overclock pushing it up to 62 FPS
average with lows at 53 and 49 the horas
place is next at 61 average effectively
identical to the sc2 and performance
placement is mostly the same at 1440p
with the EVGA sc2 card stock running an
average of 95 fps flanked on either side
by the 1080i extreme or s card at 94 FPS
on the gaming X overclocked cards note
that the gaming x OC numbers are showing
some loss in frame times in the lows
that dither more with clock fluctuation
overclocking the sc2 gets us up to about
99 FPS average with lows at 86 and 81
fps sc2 is more stable with this
overclock than our gaming act some
extreme overclocked both of which had
hits to frame time consistency with an
OC as said the hits weren't all that
critical to overall performance and were
not noticeable as an end-user 1080p
results lambda sc2 at 122 FPS average
more or less tied with the gigabyte
extreme card overclocking allows the sc2
to chart top once again with another
narrow victory over the nearby 1080i
followers Mass Effect Andromeda is next
with 4k performance topped by the
gigabyte extreme card by insignificant
amounts followed by the sc2 and gaming
act cards closely the founders edition
card for references plants at around 65
FPS average with the thermal limits
removed thanks to our hybrid mod that
would be a bit lower that's a cooler
1440p posts the same performance stack
with sc2
flanked again by the stock game in
action auras cards and you can check the
article for 1080p at Mass Effect
Andromeda results if you are interested
in those or if you need more time in the
1440p chart with doom and Vulcan the
1080i performance is all the same stack
as the previous game we're seeing
differences of a few FPS at most as
you'd expect capacity to card landing
marginally ahead of the extreme horas
and behind the gaming acts from MSI
overclocking again gets us between the
extreme Oris and msi gaming overclocked
cards moving on now to for honor at 4k
the gtx 1080i sc2 ends at around 31 FPS
average with lows at 64 and 61 this is
followed by the 1080i F II card with our
hybrid model 70 FPS or just straight F
II card at 66 FPS average that's a
reasonable gain over the reference card
with the reference cooler but not as
distant from the gaming action extreme
auras cards 1440p parcel SC to card
between the gaming ex hybrid F II and
extreme auras cards again with no real
significant advantages for any of these
1080p results will be in the article if
you really want to see them so for
sniper lis ashes and 3d mark benchmarks
check the article below
as for the conclusion of this one the
card is slightly louder than the gaming
ax unless you control it manually once
you start controlling the fans
individually and manually you can get
lower noise outputs at about the same
temperature values as the gaming ax or
the extreme RS card and even stock the
noise isn't that much louder it is about
4 DB a louder so it's noticeable to the
human ear you can pick up the difference
but it's not terrible at least not until
you get into 100% fan speeds with any of
these devices at which point they are
all completely unbearable so slightly
louder than the gaming ax you can
manually control if you want to to
account for that it's a bit cooler to be
fair to the sc2 it does run a couple
degrees Celsius cooler than the gaming X
does and then the gigabyte extreme horas
card does so out of the box the GPIO
temperature is superior on this one but
again we have to account for that vram
difference where the cooling the vram on
the other two cards with an extended
base plate so you're sinking more stuff
into one copper plate so that is worth
noting now gaming performance is the
same on all of the devices
the only difference here is if you're
getting something like a founders
Edition card or another blower based
card where it's using a low-end blower
fan with a shroud that covers the entire
thing and has no significant coin to
speak of underneath a few of those exist
the ACS turbo is one of them MSI
normally sells one of those types of
cards and then Nvidia sells the F II
card that's the only place you're going
to see a significant difference in
gaming performance because ultimately
what we're talking about here is a
thermal limit and then once you get past
the thermal limit you run into a power
or a voltage limit and that's going to
happen on all of these cards no matter
what because NVIDIA has hard limitations
on the voltage and you've got other
limitations on the power based on my
card design and ultimately voltage as
well so you can only push these things
so far overclocking yes we got this one
higher it did fantastic and the results
at chart topped the gaming benchmarks
when it was overclocked however
overclocking is a lot more based on the
chip quality than the card itself so
while it would be great to point at any
one of these cards and say this is a
fantastic overclocker it's not really
how it works
ultimately it comes down to the chip
quality the quality of this thing right
here is more important than anything
else on this board with regard to
overclocking once you've accounted for
thermal limitations and ideally power
which they've done here so over thought
it was good but they're all kind of the
same gaming they're all kind of the same
you see where I'm going with this the
only difference is in noise
temperatures and price the price of this
one is $720 it still has a good cooler
noise is okay you can account for where
it's not and it's 30 bucks cheaper than
the other two we've reviewed which are
the extreme ores and the gaming X now
the extreme Oris has a cooler RGB LEDs
if that's something you really care
about it does do those better than this
does but if you want to spend $30 for it
that's really up to you that's that's a
judgment call only you can make
ultimately $720 better price than 750
our cards better cooler than the $700
turbo type cards however there is still
$700 cards with decent coolers on
we just haven't looked at them yet
gigabyte has one of them the wind forest
cards and I'm interested in looking at
those only because if we take in all
these things stated about gaming
performance being the same and
overclocking mean roughly the same on
the cards so far if we take that get a
$700 card with a decent cooler on it
then should you just buy that card
that's what it comes down to you but for
now this is the best one we've tested in
terms of price of performance however if
you want LEDs look at the gigabyte
odorous if you want the bigger fans that
are a bit quieter look at the gaming ex
from MSI and if you want something
cheaper hang on we'll look around for
