the Final Fantasy benchmark is basically
pointless right now we still wanted to
put out the last bit of data we had on
it before moving on and that's CPU data
so the primary interesting point here is
testing the thread count and the
utilization of thread count which you
can specify through command line with
the Final Fantasy benchmark hence why
it's actually it'd be a great tool if it
worked properly but anyway we're gonna
be testing SMT and hyper threading a
couple of other things today for CPUs
not doing a whole suite of CPUs because
halfway through doing all this data
collection is when we realize like oh
this benchmarks actually not great so
but I did want to publish what we got
before we just move on completely and
forget about it till launch before that
this video is brought to you by EVGA and
their GTX ten ATT is c2 video card with
icx technology the 1080 is c2 has a nine
thermal sensors spread across the board
which allows you to easily check the
cooling performance of the vram the view
RM power components and the GPU this
makes for better noise to performance
tuning in software and you can learn
more about the sc2 at the link in the
description below
a few notes here before we get started
if you missed it we have a video about
why the Final Fantasy benchmark we think
is sort of flawed this comes back to an
issue of being optimization on square
enix side I think we talked about this
in the article a lot more than the video
there's like six paragraphs at the end
of that article talking about how
ultimately comes down to square enix not
down a game works because although game
works is implicated in this and then
Vidya does have a responsibility to
clear their name and make sure the
developers are implementing their stuff
properly it's still Square Enix who are
calling basically every object in the
game which we're working on confirming
with more tools by the way they're
calling it in and rendering it and just
loading down the GP resources all the
time so it doesn't matter if it's game
works or not game works objects like
hair works applied to the buffalo are
particularly impactful and are what
tipped us off to this problem because
you can toggle game works through an i
and i hack and run the test in an area
with zero game works
and you'll still see it performance
Delta when you turn it on versus off in
an a/b test hence leading us to the
discovery that a whole bunch of stuff is
being rendered all the time we're now
using another tool called render dock
still learning a lot about it and we've
pulled some of the meshes out from
frames that don't contain those meshes
in the camera in the viewport at all so
yeah some interesting stuff we're still
working on just out of curiosity at this
point but basically there's a lot of
stuff being drawn and that means this is
actually an awful CPU benchmark as well
because at 1080p medium we're still
bumping into a framerate limiter on a
1080i at 1080p 1920 by 1080 despite the
name being a 1080 Ti it is not actually
supposed to stop at 1080p resolution so
it's not a great benchmark 1080 low
we're still pretty much about mean up
against the cap so it's it's really just
not optimized right now and if it is
then Wow huh yikes
but yeah so let's just let's go through
the numbers and you'll see what I mean
we can start this piece by illustrating
just how easily the game bottlenecks on
the GPU even when we're trying to do a
CPU bench this is at 1080p medium
settings for the first chart and we're
clearly hitting a bottleneck at around
137 FPS average on the GPU GPU is a gtx
1080i FTW 3 i'm on one of the best
gaming cards you can get right now and
it's at 1080p medium settings and that's
still too much to be a viable cpu
benchmark with these settings we only
start seeing real divergence from
high-end parts when we step down to $100
our 3 CPUs for example so yeah
illustrating the point this comes back
to what we found with Final Fantasy 15 s
benchmarks silent rendering of nearly
everything on the map it's not just game
works it's basically all the 3d objects
like the Buffalo itself which is a game
works object it's the host of game works
objects but here's another example this
is a frame we analyzed from the game
where it's the main character on a
fishing dock and even during this frame
the game is still rendering cars that
aren't nearby rendering item chests that
aren't in frame were nearby and
rendering large portions of highway that
are located miles away we have another
shot where the characters are drive
around and we're still rendering for
example the birds and the iguanas or
whatever they are and things that are 2
minutes further into the benchmark than
they are at the current scene so we're
still looking into this still need to
clarify if this is actually stuff that's
being drawn or if it's just this utility
intercepting these things and we'll talk
about this more later but anyway it
looks like there's a lot of stuff going
on that shouldn't be so after stepping
down to 1080p low we can finally start
to plot some actual CPU performance
differences we're still bottle necking
at the high end but not as flatly as
before with these settings the Intel i7
8700 K demonstrates our point of Givi
limitations overclocked to 5 gigahertz
or stock we're still bumping up against
a rough 174 fps checkpoint the GPU
utilization is nearly 100% at this point
further illustrating that limitations of
usefulness for this benchmark are bound
by even GPUs at 1080p low anyway a shiny
note here is that the game does seem to
like threads but only up to a point with
am these r7 1700 we noticed that
performance improves a thousand he
disabled and we saw performance uplift
at 5.1 percent from the stock r7 1700 to
the rs7 1700 with SMT off for the r5
1600 X we observed a 4% vorontsov list
by disabling SMT and note also that
frame time consistency is not hugely
impacted we are technically plotting a
downtrend in low-end frame time
consistency but we can't confidently
state whether this is statistically
significant or accurate as the benchmark
is simply too inconsistent to establish
confidence in that 0.1% lowest wane this
is further illustrated by the opposite
behavior on the r7 1700 where we still
saw average FPS performance uplift but
we also saw 0.1% low performance uplift
relating this back to our previous
research with the num threads commands
we believe that the game encounters a
point of diminishing returns at around 8
threat up until that point more threads
is better and after that point though we
either lose performance from an
inefficient load balancing across the
threads or we stagnate in performance
this leads to a greater discussion on
CPU utilization
Asian for which we also have charts from
previous research because lower
utilization is not in fact a good thing
there's a misconception that a game
utilizing minimal amounts of the CPU
means that the CV has more Headroom for
background processing in reality what
this means is that we're load balancing
across all the threads inefficiently and
losing performance as a result with any
component you want to be fully engaged
or close to it in any task and a closer
to 100% the better because that means if
you're able to leverage the component to
its fullest potential not wasting any
performance the background operations
that exist should have some native load
balancing and the OS should work with
them to distribute resources as needed
otherwise you can manually do it and
back to the Final Fantasy 15 1080p low
chart the 7700 K and the r5 1400 both
demonstrate we're disabling
hyper-threading or as some tea results
and a net negative in these instances
the r5 1400 CPU sees a deficit in
average FPS and frame time consistency
the 7700 K achieves an appreciably
different average FPS but has halved
0.1% lows we attributed this to a four
thread limitation on both devices which
the game really seems to not like at the
low end highlighting the r3 CPU the r5
1400 and the 7700 K with us on T off the
game does not like working with four
threads at all at the high end with the
r7 1700 and r5 1600 X the extra threads
should actually be toggled down to a
count of eight for peak performance we
are uncertain about the 87 100 KS
performance behaviors without hyper
threading because we can't reduce GPU
load enough to limit the CPU eliminating
the CPU would require 480p or some other
really low resolution which enters a
realm of becoming a strict academic
study and exits any usefulness
whatsoever looking back at our CPU
utilization chart from a few days ago we
can show again that using num threads
commands to limit thread utilization
does have a noteworthy impact the result
is improved or equal performance with
half of the r7 seventeen hundred's
threads interestingly despite this game
seemingly hitting a point of diminishing
returns at eight threads it will still
attempt to use every thread you give it
just in a less efficient way also
interestingly this type of limitation
would indicate an IPC bias or a
frequency bias in the very least so when
we consider that but you look at the
numbers Final Fantasy 15 as a benchmark
is actually doing pretty well on rising
despite having performance behaviors
that would typically suggest a frequency
bias so in this instance we have for
example an overclocked r7 1700 at 4
gigahertz versus an i7 7700 K at 5
gigahertz and the r7 is still favored by
the Final Fantasy 15 benchmark which is
certainly noteworthy and potentially
impressive we'll see what happens as the
square-enix developers continue to
refine their game so that it's more than
just a 4 gigabyte benchmark I mean this
is not representative of anything
however from a cpu performance
standpoint I shouldn't suspect that
would change very much it seems things
would change more on the GPU side with
all the rendering issues were
encountering so from what we're seeing
now especially given one month left
there's no time to refactor the engine
or anything like that it seems likely
that the r7 will in fact retain a pretty
good performance advantage in this
particular title you will want to look
into the option of running the numbers
command will have to revisit at launch
but running num threads equals eight
would limit the thread count down to a
point where you actually get some more
performance than if you let it use all
16 and it will use all 16 if you allow
the game to however the load balancing
is a bit more favorable on eight threads
rather than 16 and I guess depend on
where you benchmark it seems to
outperform a 7700 K when both are
overclocked which is absolutely
noteworthy and the 8700 K does
outperform both of those devices as it
does have both frequency and threads
however we can't actually pinpoint how
high it would go without a GPU
bottleneck without just without doing
480p or something which is pointless so
that's kind of where we're we're stuck
now the 8700 K may be doing better than
we're seeing on the charts because we
just we don't have a way to know how
many more frames it would be drawing if
it were unencumbered by the GPU a very
interesting game benchmark anyway from a
an optimization standpoint and he is
fullness standpoint I do genuinely like
the Final Fantasy 15 benchmark as a tool
for testing I just needed to be better
so we'll see what happens when the game
launches but I think that's more or less
the last bit of data we might talk about
it and it asked Gian or some of the
short video at some point but for now
that'll wrap up most the Final Fantasy
15 benchmark stuff so as always
