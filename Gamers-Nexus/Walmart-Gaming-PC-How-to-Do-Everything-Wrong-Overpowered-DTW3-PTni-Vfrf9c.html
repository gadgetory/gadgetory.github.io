glue in there Walmart's trying to get
into building gaming pcs and it's not
looking good so this is the dt w3 we
paid two thousand two hundred fifty one
dollars and 18 cents for this gaming pc
it is a 10 a TT I build with an 8700 CPU
9 K and then we don't yet know what the
motherboard or the power supply are
there's the most interesting here
because they're the easiest parts to
cheap out on and it's supposed to have
also I believe 32 gigabytes of memory in
it so this is the most expensive one
that Walmart makes and we paid for it
bought it myself and the front panel is
the most immediate point of concern
where there is about two millimeters of
space for the fans to breathe but we're
gonna do today is take it apart look at
the quality of components and figure out
if there's anything in Walmart could
have done better for their first gaming
PC builds before that this video is
brought to you by us and the just buy it
code unlike real time ray-tracing our
merch actually exists to commemorate the
most memorable quote of the year and
also Black Friday but mostly the first
thing everything in the GM store is 10%
off with a discount code just buy it at
checkout that includes our most popular
item the critically acclaimed GN mod
mats our shirts ceramic coffee mugs and
GPU component posters and everything
else as a bonus this is also a great way
to support jion's work the code last
through November 26th go to store doc
gamers access net or click the link
below first more immediately noticeable
thing is the cable management you can
see they've actually installed a GPU
support by which I mean they're using
the USB 3.0 header to retain the video
card by the cables so yeah cable
management certainly could be better not
much room for it but we've got a bunch
of wiring running around here and that's
because the USB 3 header is running to a
an expansion slot in the back for type-c
which actually means that they end up
with no USB 3 on the top of the case I'm
more curious about this memory stick so
let's let's take this out alright
ok so the memory ddr4 2400 CL 17
sixteen gx1 7b okay so I'm gonna gonna
go ahead and say this is a 16 gigabyte
stick which is 50% of what I paid for
okay that's that's not correct video
card should be a 1080 TI it is a
gigabyte card so I'll give Kyle credit
for identifying that in his video by
only the rear ayah or the expansion
cover okay video card support bracket no
present opinion on that cuz I'm more
concerned about if we got what we paid
for the video card retention system of a
USB 3 cable is working though so okay
this video card is model GV 1070 which
is not a 1080 TI it's in fact quite far
from a 1080 TI so okay so 1070 16
gigabytes of RAM what we bought versus
what we got we bought this we put a
screenshot on the screen or something
this is a $2,100 computer before
shipping you can see GT X 1080 TI
32 gigabytes of RAM 512 gigabyte SSD the
one in here is not that either
and that's 2,100 bucks which is already
a ripoff there's already a tremendous
ripoff Walmart has the biggest margins
we've seen of any of the s i--'s it's
completely crazy because if you look at
even just like high-power CyberPower you
can get an r/t X 20 80 and a 9700 K for
cheaper than this actually so that's
already ripoff but what they've done is
rip us off more we got this so we bought
the $2,100 1080i system already being
ripped off and then we receive
the $1400 overpowered gaming dtw one and
you can actually reach that invoice on
the invoice where is it
invoice Opie game desktop DTW three PC
2000 $99 clearly I but I clicked the
right thing and I added the right thing
to the cart and I paid for the right
thing that that was a very expensive
thing to buy and what we got was ADT w1
which is a different SKU with the GTX
970 16 gigabytes of RAM so here's the
thing they shipped the ROM wrong
products there's a few ways to look at
that
but the box it came in says NVIDIA GTX
970 so they put the right computer in
the right box and I guess that makes it
all they had to do is check the invoice
to make sure the right computer went to
the right person but then if you look at
this one the external shipping container
it also says dtw 100 also separately
their logo is a Sipapu fish I guess
because that's the only it's court
Patrick that's the only fish that's
shaped like a and oh that's a pretty
colossal cup by Walmart on that one but
it could be across shipping issue I
guess the question is whether support
will help us out
hi I ordered one of the overpowered
Walmart gaming pcs and it just got here
and it's actually not not the right
product
Steve yeah so I ordered the dtw three
there's the model number and I received
the dtw one which is a it's a price
difference the the products I received
is a $1400 product and the one I paid
for is a $2,100 product so I guess
they'll ship a replacement after they
get this one back so the reason this
bothers me though is because we don't
know there's just some widespread
logistics issue or two one off and they
just got they just happen to hit a
reviewer with it but if it is a wider
spread issue the concerning point is
that it's a computer the target audience
for a Walmart computer is probably
someone who doesn't know a lot about
computers like maybe a parent find for a
kid to play for at night or something
and that audience isn't going to know
the difference between the parts and
this one and the parts and the $2,100
one we were supposed to get so the
concerning thing is if this happens on
any scale of 1 or greater there is a
high chance potentially of a customer
not knowing they got significantly less
than what they paid for and that is
ultimately the problem here with what we
ended up with I mean yeah they're going
to replace it they're not cross shipping
which is pretty annoying but they're
going to replace it it's just that it
shouldn't have to be replaced and and
the concern again is that someone won't
know they got less than what they
actually paid for it cuz computers are
complicated but anyway let's take apart
the rest of the things so clearly it's
not the correct one but we can still
critique the build process and the build
quality well that explains why
that USB 3 cable was kind of difficult
to remove they've got a big blob of hot
glue on the motherboard holding the USB
3 header in why why would you do that
it's fine like I guess for shipping
purposes they don't want it to come out
or something but seriously okay so what
what is the motherboard it is a gigabyte
h3 10 m/s - is that the 22 nanometer
chipset model let's see how was the $70
the cable management clearly could have
been done better so they've got I mean
huh hmm yeah I guess they could have
routed some of it through here I was
gonna say they don't have a ton of
options with this case but for example
this leads to SATA cables could be
routed through this hole here I'd be a
bit cleaner this could be routed through
that hole these could be routed through
this hole and then this could for
example not exist so what I really want
to know is a thermal paste application
and the power spot let's start with the
power supply there's the cables I mean
they are tied down like to their credit
they actually did kind of Cale manage
this side what's the power supply though
I'm curious if the power supply isn't is
improved as they increase the component
quote like if they actually shipped me
one of the ten atti
so does a great wall power supply
probably also the case manufacturer and
you can do 21 amps on the CPU which it's
really not not indicative of a whole lot
let's add there you go 500 watts 500
watts ten seventy eighty seven hundred
that's fine but either way I'm not a
great power supply is it rated eighty
plus anything I don't think so
they had it faced the fan was facing the
right direction that's good better than
expected CPU can do 252 watts so I mean
that's fine for an 8700 not overclocked
CPU I guess definitely garbage power
supply this whole
thing is kind of a ripoff I mean yes you
can always build your own for cheaper
but that's not really the point here the
point is that you can go to like any
other SI that's existed forever
CyberPower ibuypower
you can go to even someone like del
probably and get a better quality system
like with better parts in it for a
cheaper price so we have we we have an
iWeb power system here that's two
thousand dollars cheaper and it has an
RT X 2080 not a 1080 TI although we
never did get that and it has 9700 K and
again it's cheaper and it has like real
parts in it so that's definitely a big
difference here between Walmart's and
what the other people make incumbent uh
size so they replace the reset switch
with an LED button on the top you can
push it to change the color of the LEDs
that is plugged into an extension cable
which then goes into an LED content fan
controller well they're not a good one
but some no direct fan speed control for
the case fans so this goes on the side
and where'd it go do we have object
permanence yet it's gone
so no airflow at all on this side glass
comes all the way out to the front for
some reason that mother would an h3 10
motherboard is on this chipset they're
dealing with significantly reduced
bandwidth so the bus speed here instead
of eight Giga transfers per spec and DM
i3 with basically any other Intel
motherboard chipset like BB 360 chipset
you're getting five giga transfers per
second DMI to so that's a significant
reduction also the memory is a bit funny
here you'll notice it has two slots this
is going to be true pretty much all h3
ten motherboards they can only have one
dim perch annal so the max you can have
is really two Dimps and that is a
limiter as well USB support the i/o
support is significantly limited you're
dealing with a lot fewer USB devices the
max number of PC
Express Lanes off of the chipset is that
be that thing right there is reduced to
6 from 12 on the B 360 board so big
difference is there in chipset quality
and choosing this chipset on what is
really supposed to be a high-end gaming
machine is is a poor cost-saving move by
Walmart or whoever they are employing to
do this next thing this is just kind of
sloppy in here so you'll notice that
there is an 8 pin EPS 12 volt connector
for a four pin EPS 12 volt slot on the
motherboard and although it's fine
because I mean clearly they just split
in half anyway it's fine it's just
they should have pre split just looks
it's just sloppy to have half of the
connector handing over the motherboard
header without going without being in
use okay now the real quality inspection
can begin check that out do you need
some sticky substance on your USB 3
cable because you get it with Walmart
along with probably everything else on
there store shelves so here's our board
and pretty small board H 310 ms 2
gigabyte board - here Kyle did his video
talking about the product page and in
Kyle spirit because he can't see this in
person right now I will mention it's got
the ketchup and mustard cables
accompanied by whatever blue is
associated with blue cheese I don't know
I'm fine with those typically but that's
because I want to be able to clamp
things or know where the voltages are
for something like this I would actually
prefer them to be blackout I mean
they're expensive systems oh yeah we
should look at the fan Koonin is the fan
and or maybe if it's a pinion then maybe
soon on a thermal total solution
provider double ball bearing DC 12-volt
and probably about ninety two
millimeters but let's double check
ninety two millimeters as you can see on
the
calibers oh yeah depended I guess 85
played the blade but let's call it
roughly 92 because that's a real size
and then we can look at their thermal
paste application quality because that's
a small attention to detail thing that I
feel like they would mess up I still
can't get over that they're using an H
310 motherboard with nearly like half
the DMI as as B 360 and yet it's got an
8700 oh no my fingerprints are gonna be
in at their own pace now they'll know
let's see if there's actually an 8700
and see if they robbed us there too yep
there's an 8700 I'm gonna go with
inoffensive for the rest of that okay
this part is kind of interesting too
so drives you might be asking how many
hard drives you're not but you are now
and the reason you're asking is because
there's one a hard drive in there and
when you boot this thing into Windows
we've we've been running we already ran
thermal tests on this before the
teardown Patrick's been doing a lot of
that once you boot into Windows you'll
see that there are four partitions for
the hard drive we're not sure why there
is a beautiful an SSD that we're booting
from as well I'm not sure what spec that
is though let's try and get access to
that a data you'll see it's the it's the
critically-acclaimed
is SS three one six a data drive
540 sequential read 510 sequential right
that's fine no publicly no easily found
IOPS rating but the sequential is fine
so anyway that's the SSD
now one thing Patrick noticed here is if
you look at that controller we were
talking about the fans the the question
is it does it look familiar
so there's the Lian Li one in fact this
controller even uses the same obnoxious
fan header as the Lian Li fans so you
could put Bora fans in here those
annoying ones from before they revamp
them where it's a proprietary header
nothing else uses realistically Lian Li
is probably behind this almost certainly
buying this fan controller from the same
company as Walmart is it's not I
sincerely doubt Lian Li is oh yeah I
mean this controller for Walmart it's
probably just they've found the same
supplier but just kind of interesting if
you wanted to see some familiar parts in
here
okay so we've criticized a lot here
let's look at the upsides the upsides
are there using the SSD cages as cable
management guides okay don't try to try
to stay positive try to stay positive
they have actual kill management routing
clips here just plastic guides and
they're used pretty well so job well
done I guess for use in the space that
they have some of the cables should be
routed through different holes like I
don't know anywhere else but there's not
a whole lot of room for them to route
stuff I guess you could like I was
saying earlier push some of the cables
through this channel because the
motherboard only covers about half of
this final distance here so I it's kale
Mandarin it's okay on the back sort of
it's just that like I think that's about
the only positive thing I could find the
panel spacing is terrible dust filters
are lacking so there's zero dust filter
on the front you know we were going to
take that front panel off let's do that
where are you going need to have to send
it back all right so here's another
problem no dust filter and this is just
really really such a small expense to
skip this is a consumer facing
mainstream computer that probably
parents are buying grandparents are
buying maybe kids who who don't really
know what the
don't understand computers now why else
do you go to Walmart and pay prices that
are over every other si in the market
even if you don't want to build one
that's a valid --it you don't have to
build a computer there's no elitism here
if you want to buy one that's perfectly
fine but just buy one that makes sense
for the price and there are plenty of
competitors who will build a better
system again we've got that ibuypower
one theirs has dust filters this has no
dust filter and for something which is
probably never going to be open because
it is a prebuilt it should have some
basics like dust filtration this thing's
gonna get packed with dust as it gets
used and that is going to hurt that
small air cooler it's it's just gonna
struggle as it ages so it's just just
kind of really being chief where they
shouldn't be I think probably the just
one of the weirdest choices is this one
I keep going back to it I know but usb3
instead of coming from up there and
going into the motherboard it's going to
the back for a single type C header one
which shows the it shows that there was
zero customization of this case other
than the side panel on the front panel
being printed on or there having that
logo glued onto it because if there any
customization you could stick that into
a USB port like an existing USB 2 header
you just stick it in there and fill it
with plastic it doesn't even need to be
retooled so kind of weird but no
customization going on probably no one
really in product development who knows
what they're doing hopefully because if
they do I'm I'm sorry but anything else
I don't know I think that's about it
really the the biggest problem here
other than you know spending $600 plus
more than than the cost of this computer
by Walmart's own prices not counting the
amout they were already gouging the
price is the biggest problem I suppose
is there's looking at the core i7 8th
gen sticker is that the component choice
is bad so even for this model $1400 I
think
1070 with a single stick of 16 gigabytes
of memory in an H series h3 10
motherboard we've got one dim por
channel with a truncated diiemma or a
bus speed / DMI and that other component
choice is like well the power supply 500
watt great wall power supply no 80 plus
certification on it you can get better
components from any other si and part of
this is they've got deals in place they
have people who work there who know what
they're doing even if you don't agree
with buying a prebuilt like you got a
got acknowledge that this is objectively
worse than the pre builds from pretty
much every other SI that we all know the
nail I mean main gears kind of on the
expensive end Origen absolutely
expensive and where is kind of a joke
these days then you've still got cyber
power high power and digital storm all
the other ones in between zai dax all of
them at least they have enthusiasts
there NZXT is BLD that's a new one they
have enthusiasts there who know what
they're doing and and the component
choice generally at least uses
enthusiast grade components I mean stuff
that you can buy DIY you can buy this
great wall power supply DIY but you know
what I mean doesn't really count so it's
not brand name so uh yeah there's your
20 $100 computer it's actually a $1,400
computer I guess we got to got to work
that out with Walmart get a replacement
and very very disappointed in the build
quality overall disappointed in the
buying experience and I guess at this
point we'll finish our test we did
thermals already so we'll do some more
now and what we can do is run it through
testing and then we'll build the system
with the same core components perhaps
like an 8700 and a 1070 I guess or 1080i
and then see if there's any performance
difference from upgrading the
motherboard and upgrading the cooling
solution because the case sucks so
that's it for this one
they are watching subscribe for more you
can go to store like Aaron's access net
if you want to buy the piece
building Matt I worked on in this video
it's the one we make it's very high
quality build service or you go to
patreon.com/scishow gamers nexus x that
directly there as well and we'll have
more coverage on this so stay tuned
actually we have a head-to-head with an
incumbent SI i'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
