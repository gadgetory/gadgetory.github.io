announcement was made at pax where we
covered the be 350 a320 and xB and a 300
chipsets for sff builds those last ones
but we didn't have a high-end chipset
yet for the upcoming Zen architecture
which would include the FX revamp and
higher-end chips summit ridge being part
of that today though we know the name of
it x 370 and that's about all we know so
i guess the news there is that the
high-end chipset is theoretically called
x 370 and this was posted by XP review
one of the asian language websites will
link that down below but google
translate really won't help you out
there all they're really saying though
is that x 370 will ship alongside summit
ridge cpus and it will add lanes as
expected for the high speed i/o devices
that would be things like sada or pcie
gen3 USB gen 3.1 or what have you so
that's really all we're looking at the
build of Zen architecture does make this
a bit more unique than previously in
that the chipset doesn't play quite as
big a role as in previous architectures
and platforms from even Intel or from
AMD so the big thing here is that with
a.m. for these on architecture most of
the stuff is being piped through the CPU
most of the i/o being piped through the
CPU there's still effectively an i/o
controller on the motherboard it's kind
of like a glorified southbridge we'll
talk about that more in the future but x
370 is the name of the high-end chipset
that will be shipping alongside summit
ridge and available on it am for
platforms which is now as we've said
before the unified platform for gen 7ap
use and for zen cpus NZXT is a new era
fan series AER not a ir has been
officially announced it's a new set of
RGB fans from NZXT it enters into the
arena of RGB fans which seems like it's
really getting quite full as we talked
about at computex where the years trend
is pretty much RGB everything and
tempered glass this represents the
tempered glass side of the argument in
this news story and the xt is
representing the RGB side of the
argument at PAX we saw a Corsair has
some new RGB LED fans Thurman will take
a sort of the incumbent in this arena
with their rain fans are iing and now
NZXT with air the standout marketing
point for NZXT is that these will pair
with the hue plus which is an NZXT
product and that allows for customizable
RGB LED control including daisy chains
of fans in groups so you could put
groups of fans together on the two
separate channels on the hue plus and
configure them as you desire for within
the case the fans will be available in
120 and 140 millimeter models and use
fluid dynamic bearings that accommodate
an RPM range of 500 to 1500 rpm the low
end of that of course allowing a fairly
low noise output that we'll have to test
that separately air flow is rated by the
company at 2261 that for CFM for 120
millimeters or about 24 to about 72 for
140 millimeters eight leds are present /
fan there's a lot of LEDs so these will
probably be some of the brightest RGB or
at least most vibrant RGB LED fans we've
seen yet so again we'll have to look at
that and they use light channel to
increase the brightness and reduce
undesirable light bleed the fans like
most RGB LED fans are going to be
expensive so they are thirty dollars
piece for the 120 millimeter models and
35 for 140 millimeters if you prefer
those and then there are kits as well so
NZXT is doing a hue + + 2 fan kit with
120 or 140 you can do those setups for
eighty dollars or ninety dollars as a
good deal of money to spend on LEDs fans
obviously will help with the cooling but
if you're being honest with yourself you
buy this stuff for the LEDs so almost a
hundred bucks if you want to do that set
up with two fans and a hue plus we
reviewed the hue + separately if you're
curious about that we can do a link in
the post roll video or something but the
fans should begin shipping in October
the next news item is the roseville
cullinan case that we saw at computex
2016 this one was a little bit delayed
partly because of shipping issues
globally not really something that road
or any manufacturer had control over but
it is coming here now so as of today
this should start being listed on
websites like Newegg it will begin
shipping within a couple of weeks by end
of sep tember definitely and we have a
review coming up as obviously we have
the case so wait on our review before
making a purchasing decisions but to go
over the basics again and refresh
everyone from copy text it's got four
millimeter thick tempered glass on the
left and the right side it is a normal
mother board layout not inverted like
many of the cases we've seen lately so
normal mother board layout that means
this is the side where you'd be looking
into the case and seeing the components
other sides cabling and things like that
SSDs the front has three fans so it's
got four stock as far as we know based
on this model 120 millimeter fans three
intake and one exhaust this front panel
here does also have a tempered glass
front but on the side there's your
intake grill so obviously you can't
breathe through the glass in the front
but this isn't really new to the
industry it's just knew that it's being
done with glass now so previously the s3
40 the h 4 40 the Corsair 400 see the
course are 600 see all these cases have
sort of a flat plastic front that's the
new design aesthetic for the last few
years that's what's in so that's being
continued here just with glass and then
as with those four cases I just named
it's breathing through the side so
that's where your intake comes in the
top has it works there we go one of
these so that's your magnetic filter
also kind of in right now and was big
with the Corsair 400 °c and 600 °c and
the rest of it will talk about in the
review but that's sort of rose Wells big
case for actually the last couple years
this is the most promising thing they've
had in a while since the r5 if you
remember the r5 that was one of our
earliest reviews that I don't know if we
even made a video for it but this is the
the best thing since then it's been a
while but they're getting back into the
game MSRP is 180 street price is 150
we'll review it and look at thermals and
build quality and all that very shortly
so subscribe for that and in other case
news coolermaster just announced
Master case pro 3 we have some shots of
the cooler master booth from pax West
where they had an explosion of their
case up on the wall kind of cool to look
at from a b-roll perspective but the
master case pro 3 is a micro ATX version
of the case you've probably seen
advertised on some of the other youtuber
channels which was the master case 5 and
that's mostly marketed for its
modularity so certainly part gimmick and
part function with the master case
series from coolermaster the pro 3 does
the same as the master case 5 it uses
thumbscrews everywhere to basically make
for a modular set of drive cages modular
set of even fan mounting hardware
radiator mounting hardware all that
stuff can be removed or added if you
don't want it or if you want it the case
should be selling for around a hundred
dollars coolermaster is trying to do
kind of the DLC approach and that
they're selling accessories add on
things like that on their website to
plug into all of the will call them I
guess just really just modular sockets
which is really just thumb screws on the
chassis frame so that's positioned all
over the frame you can buy stuff from
them and upgrade the case I suppose we
haven't really tested those cases yet
but will hopefully be doing so the unit
includes it to one hundred and forty
millimeter fans at 1200 RPM max and
those are front and rear pretty standard
setup it's also got support for up to 5
fans total can fit up to a 280 mm eater
radiator so that would be the 2 140 s
set up and it can fit eight total hard
drives and all of that is semi modular
so the drive cages can be removed as
well the drive cages and the power
supply are in a separate partition
within the case kind of the lower half
but it's not quite the same as the
shrouds were seen in virtually every
other case on the market right now I
believe including this one so that's the
master case pro 5 this is the cullinan
x3 70 is the new and these n high-end
chipset or what's left of the chipsets
anyway what will enable Zen and summit
ridge at the very least an den deoxys
got the new air fans so that's all for
this news item as always patreon link in
the post roll video to help us out
directly we'll throw a link to the NZXT
eq review over there as well and then
links
from below for more information I'll see
you all next time
