as of today the product will be shipping
on July 19th and MSRP is $250 so those
are the key items that of course
everyone's interested in before getting
to that this coverage is brought to you
by MSI and their lineup of GTX 1060 1070
and 1080 gaming cards including the
gaming X that we recently reviewed in
terms of the market stack this is the
founders Edition card you can see it's a
good deal different from the 1070 this
is a frankenstein 1080 we made so pay no
attention to that a little bit different
than the 1070 in some ways but the fact
that it is called the founders Edition
remains and the 1060 EFI version will be
priced at $300 and is supposed to be
properly a limited run I don't know if
there's a production number on that run
but this will be a limited founders
edition unlike the previous ones the
card is priced at $250 if you buy the
AIB partner models that go that low but
of course they can price wherever they
want the stack they can go up to
however high they want they can go as
low as 250 for the suggested retail
price the card itself is a pretty short
PCB comparatively for the previous cards
so the 1080 and 1070 are ten and a half
inches long on the PCB and they've got a
four inch height one and a half inch
depth this card the PCB as you'll see
here is shorter than the cooler itself
the PCB is at 6 and 3/4 inches with the
card entirely at nine and a half the
height and depth are the same so the
interesting thing here before getting
into core specs is that this 6 pin
headers off to the side and if we look
at the back we can see it's actually got
some kind of soldering going on here to
run a wire off to the 6 pin so that may
make modifications interesting if you're
trying to put an Arctic cooler solution
or aftermarket solution on there or
something like that so that will be
interesting to look at we'll look at
that for review a day now in terms of
the core specs the stuff that you need
to know is that the card has 12 1280
CUDA cores and that is
for reference compared against 1920 CUDA
cores of the GTX 1070 and compared
against 2560 CUDA cores of the GTX 1080
and so this one's at 1280 total it's got
six gigabytes of gddr5 clocked at eight
gigabits per second so that's about as
high as it goes that going to g5x that's
the same as this card the 1080 is
running on g5 X which is about 10
gigabits per second so that's the
difference there there were rumors that
there's a three gigabyte GTX 1060 card
we have received nothing to validate
these rumors this card is not three
gigabytes you can look at it and see
right now and there was nothing in
Nvidia's press release about a three
gigabyte card so as it stands now the
information we have today there is only
a six gigabyte model announced and it's
$250 the rest of the specs this thing
has a boost clock the core boost clock
of 1.7 gigahertz and it's running off of
a single six pin header as shown we
don't have much more than that right now
I don't even have the drivers yet but
we'll be posting a review as soon as the
embargo lifts for reviews and just a
reminder the release date is July 19th
now in terms of other sort of statements
from Nvidia accompanying this
announcement today and video stated
quote the GTX 1060 is on average 15%
faster and over 75 percent more power
efficient than the closest competitive
product end quote and that was
specifically mentioned for gaming titles
gaming titles so that's not synthetic
benchmarks and not necessarily VR
clearly this is in reference to the rx
480 we will validate this statement on
our own benchmarking as we always do see
if it's actually that percentage faster
see if there's any trade-offs but it
will be an interesting battle to look at
certainly and that is kind of Nvidia's
posturing on it they're clearly going
after the 480 here and the power
efficiency thing I don't know if there's
75% more power efficient metric is
looking at the the our X 480 pre
optimization patch it must be seven
sixteen point seven point one so we'll
see if that changes
but that's that's something we'll look
at as the announcement actually comes up
this is a 16 nanometer chip so it's
still the same architecture as the other
Pascal chips these are GP 104
there's 104 dot 200 and 104 - 400 for
the 1070 the 1080
this is GP 106 it's a new version of
Pascal the same Pascal architecture just
a different implementation of it with
the smaller SMS and cores and things
like that so that's what we got for you
the only other item here that I haven't
mentioned is is a 120 watt TDP at full
load full 100% gaming load 120 watts is
what we're told and will support SMP and
then I suppose I'll throw in that Ansel
and VR funhouse are forthcoming in the
next few weeks as well or the next week
even but those quite honestly don't
interest me
so this is where the news is that today
stay tuned for our review of the card
will do thermal analysis hopefully some
additional VR benchmarking we might be
there by the time this is releasing but
we'll see and other than that all the
all the other tests are as they normally
are so subscribe to catch that content
as it goes live and be the first to see
how the GTX 760 performs we'll test it
worse everything that makes sense 480
1070 what have you and the pay check the
post roll video if you want helps out
directly thank you for watching I'll see
you all next time
you
$250 MSRP for the GTX 760 the founders
