about power design and I said you know
what let's let's stop this and record it
because a lot of this is over in my head
so let's just get it on camera and go
through it for viewership as well and
I'm joined by Jonathan from Asus he's an
ro GPM write work on the ROG products
and we're gonna talk through some
transient response some load line
briefly things like that on vrm design
it's really interesting information
gives you a basic like a primer on the
types of things ACS has to think about
when they're building a PRM and so I
guess we'll just point out here that
this is really top-level stuff there
we're not talking like specific use
cases or edge cases or anything like
that we're just primer only yeah so
don't don't go and try to design a vrm
with this because you'll need a lot more
information well go through the basics
today should be pretty fun and hopefully
we'll have more content like this before
that this video is brought to you by us
and the gamers Nexus toolkit on store
documents axis net our brand new toolkit
just launched and contains ten custom
made drivers for video card disassembly
reap hasting and tear downs the eight
core tools are made of high-quality
chromium vanadium alloys steel that's
built for long service life and
resistance to wear during use the other
two tools are carbon steel hex heads
that were custom ground down for
capacitor clearance on video cards all
the tools are easily mounted to a
pegboard
or stored in the GN made tool bag for
easy transport learn more at the link in
the description below ok so erm
structure let's go through this VTR
controller power status CPU over here
that I see like steps on the bottom I
guess so there's two main parts right
about of erm that people are kind of
concerned about number one the most
obvious is thermal performance right if
people want the components to run cooler
because it makes it last longer yeah
yeah and well for thermal for thermal
performance right it gets a little bit
confusing because people a lot of people
think that like adding more phases is
better and this is true because when you
add you know a second peter fourth PWM
signal here you have to add a fourth
power so now your power load is split
between four components into three right
and so when you add more face
technically it's it's it's bad
performance therm only better but when
you're talking about the phase you're
actually talking about the control
signal how you're controlling so in our
solution right now we're actually kind
of using like more power stages per P
double control signals running in
parallel and that spreads the load while
on you know removing the doublet which
you know introduced some delay you know
just an example at these two boards so
you've got I think these are like the
same board right except the prm's
changed yeah so you've got a twin and
and then an extended phase design yep so
the heat load on the e-zine what does it
look like thermally is it is it
basically do they end up looking the
same thermally or is like or just twin
perform better or a while yeah so both
of these right since the the components
that are used are exactly the same the
power spread across the same area and
the difference is actually over here you
can see these you can see these little
tiny eye sees right yeah those are the
doublers right so basically these had a
little bit of heat but that's just like
icy efficiency right
virtually nothing okay so that's like
kind of negligible but then over here is
you know the toe ball comes in over here
passes through these components and then
this then goes through you know the
bicho kind of provide power ultimately
to the CPU right and we were else
talking at how you've got the caps kind
of evenly spaced you know your your
power your a pen power can I just can't
necessarily always be closest right
you're over here right so when it comes
in over here by the time you get to this
part of the power plan there's a bit of
like they can be like some our drop or
like you know sometimes like the power
doesn't distribute perfectly evenly
across this entire distance okay and so
we these capacitors kind of act as many
batteries to hold the charge hold the
charge and then like distribute it when
necessary right right now these also
function as you know ripple of ripple
filtering right which is necessary if
you know if you're using fewer phases
right because this is something that is
a weakness you know
when you do have less faces this is
electrical we can get into that in a
little bit okay detail later but if
you're concerned about thermal
performance right what you really need
to look at is how many power stages you
have and if power stage is basically an
ICU that comprises of a driver high side
MOSFET and a low side MOSFET and
actually between those three components
the driver itself actually doesn't add
any additional heat okay the fact that
the driver is integrated with the high
side low side MOSFET the impedances they
can all be kind of tuned to be more more
ideal for each other right so it's a
more efficient package overall okay
there's two things we were talking about
mainly there's ripple and then there's
transient response or I guess right
these are the two parts that kind of
cover the electrical performance part of
okay all right and we just need to make
sure one that I understand what you're
talking about and then to that the
viewer is how much time you're talking
about so we'll go through I guess top
level of ripple and a transient response
so yeah this is the other half to kind
of more phases as batteries because when
you have more phases right they turn on
kind of interns right right then
basically so 6:16 phase on the
bright-red yeah
and then this is actually like the
amount of ripple and you see it's not it
doesn't remain constant across all duty
cycles it changes hmm
and this is actually like for example
like the the equation for in pull rebook
ripple current you can see it depends on
the phase number it's the current over
and phase number yeah and this is a
maximum current I'm going this is the
duty cycle okay right and so you can see
over here like when you you know when
you have less phases fewer phases right
ripple is worse and as you get higher
though you kind of see from 8 to 16 it
kind of starts getting into a
diminishing returns right and then right
this is what we were talking about with
the capacitors earlier where you can
have input filtering also to kind of
reduce like you know the input current
to kind of not reduce it but to buffer
the input input current and you know in
general right like one capacitor ours is
rated for five five thousand lamps which
is you know so we've got a ripple
current of under 16 on for phase 15 15
amps over there
poor face yeah and so then you know you
won't need as many capacitors as what we
put on the board itself right which is
why you know sometimes you might see
like okay like one generation has fewer
technical phases than another one right
but the capacitance have remained the
same is because you know the primary
reason for why we're using those
capacitors is actually not because
ripple is an issue it's because of you
know the you didn't write the input okay
to buffer the 12 volt keep it stable to
the BRM doubt it so now let's get into
kind of like transient okay sure I'm so
like what is transient response and like
why is it important and so like I we
were talking earlier right like this
this is very simple sorry P equals it
goes be VI right this is just power as
both there's times current right is
fairly easy to understand so what
happens like you know when you're when
you're providing power over to the CPU
right as soon as the CPU kind of hits a
high loader it's that's drawing more
current right and so you got the current
sense over here oh all right so the
current sense has to come back to the PW
has a feedback information to the PWM
controller before the PWM and controller
can start saying okay I need to give
this I need to provide more current
right so if you can imagine right if for
example we're giving maybe like we're
giving like maybe like 50 watts of power
right if your current is starting to
spike up you know it goes off from like
you know 40 amps to like you know 100
amps right yeah well if you're talking
about like 50 watts of power distributed
between these two numbers right this is
like this is gonna be like 0.2 volts
this is gonna be all I just a really bad
number um but you know much bigger than
it's gonna be
should we calculate it yeah we could all
right so we we're gonna cut ahead a bit
so that we can save some time I'm just
plotting that it grabs and everything
okay so so what are we looking at right
now so right now you know this is the V
tour this is the current and it's
plotted against time right and so we
have to pin it you have like V 2 and V 1
right here these dotted lines they
represent a grid okay all right they
represent like young this is at the same
point so I say
old Asian right same time on this and
the scale on each one okay and so what
happens is when you know your current
kind of spikes up right mmm ideal world
you'd be at the cutting your voltage of
you at the drop and then basically
stabilized right away to level out yeah
well kind of match up the numbers have
to align up right and so when you're
when you're reacting over here it comes
what actually ends up happening it
usually there's a little bit of a
because there's a lag time before when
the people in control that can react to
these so I guess ideally in a perfect
world where you have no constraints you
know basically a kind of square wave yep
or it just it squares out at the edges
on each of them but in reality you're
you're on is this yes under shoot a
different thing is that is it correct
use the phrase under shoot for this or
now uh or is that a different tactical
term undershoot understand fun things
you the term mom you guys long block
yeah technically that's a different
thing no that's that's correct okay but
then you're getting into a lot of
different ok well let's let's go back
what you're saying that um so the we
forego that for now um so let me brown
these out okay so that you know so this
is more of the this is more value what
really happens but you know it at the
same time frame kind of still flies here
right so this will this will kind of dip
right and then basically what happens
what's happening over here right is
because of you know P equals bi right
the currents increasing right and the
video the few moon control still taking
time to react huh so the way you tune it
is you start replenishing current at
this point and the will make happen is
in my kind of in my kind of increase
over I say your party of v1 and then
maybe under a little bit and then and
then stabilized takes it a little bit to
fit to to level out to where it needs to
be right and what what's happening over
here is this duration right you want
this to kind of stabilize quickly and
you have to make sure this this first
peak is not it's not too low not too
extreme yeah
okay and so what is v1 and v2 you might
be kind of like asking is like why does
why does the voltage you can change
right well if you're if you remember
right you have what's called a DC load
line uh-huh yeah right and that is the
load line looks something like this
so basically you know I took her and is
going up right this is this this drop to
this drop up here that's your low like
taking effect okay and this is why I'm
getting the load line is because like a
lot of people control concerned about
the electrical performance because they
want the best overclocking capability
right and a lot of people will think
that like a zero low line is usually
like the ideal scenario but what happens
when you have a zero low line is you're
basically forcing the voltage to try to
stay at like v2 all the time okay and so
what will happen is you know if you
don't have a an appropriately steep low
line right mm-hmm
this reaction right here will increase
as low line gets flatter okay
so if you had like a low line let me if
we're done with this let me yeah sure
clean this real plank so if we so if we
applied this over here this is this will
basically look like this right
b1 and they wanted me to okay this is
basically working at I won this is a tie
to and then if you have a shallower low
line or if you have like a really flat
low line right basically I won this will
be this will be kind of the one prior
asset okay and then e2 would price
they'd say so basically it looked like I
say basically this this will be like
much bigger okay and then the selling
time would be actually much long with a
shallower load line yeah and so that's
like that's why you would need maybe
like that's why you need to kind of play
around with you know your arms a lot
right um I mean I think there is some
truth to having a shallow line because I
mean in general if the report is tuned
very well right for the CPU
characteristics I think you can get you
can general get away with the shallower
load line where you can because it can
react properly and kind of dampen you
know some of the ball to stabilize
either stabilize the current quickly
enough right but get like a perfectly
flat load line for any CRM is actually
extremely difficult order line I think
um so that's kind of a quick primer on
transient response with a little bit
kind of scuffle around a little bit of
my little story yeah okay part of the
ladder that later date up right the
importance of that is just that you know
when you're talking about transient
response like the magnitude of the the V
min right that's like at like something
like 50 millivolts right but then your
ripple the difference between the two
ripple is like something within 5
millivolts right right so it's like a
magnitude greater you know of an issue
than ripple even though ripple is
something that you see may maybe
constantly right but because you know as
we said like the difference in CPU
characteristics now because of the piece
CJ yeah cuz of power saving the turbo
boosts turbo booster then just having
more chorus right
having that dynamic current swing right
it really changed our priorities yeah
you know this is current prophecy yeah I
mean if you remember we were stuck at
four cores for like years yeah and not
just that though if you think about like
just like like something like three
years ago x99 yeah but the King of Kings
was the ten core you know recommendation
process right now we're at eight cores
on you know on top it's like we're kind
of like baffled
you know also everybody's like oh oh
yeah I think he's selling a portable
game well like we want more performance
right and I guess this is what can be
done at yeah point right now that's
seems to be the trend of what's going on
yeah oh we're just kind of going with
the flow right you have to adjust the
designs to match it yeah and so you know
there's merits to everything you know
everything's you know nothing's perfect
right there's trade-offs you're always
gonna have to make well you have time
and cost - yeah time and money is the
ultimate decider on just about
everything so yeah yeah cool well I
guess that'll give you a brief
run-through of some basics from vrm
basics so we'll we'll throw to
potentially build Zoid video in the
future with further discussion on all
the stuff here today and thank you for
joining me thank you we'll see you all
