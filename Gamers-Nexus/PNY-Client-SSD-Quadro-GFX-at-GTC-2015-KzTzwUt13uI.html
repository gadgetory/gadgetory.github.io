nexus dotnet and we're just finishing up
another trip to the gtc 2015 show floor
gtc is the GPU technology conference and
it is hosted by nvidia so it's very
heavily focused on GPUs and on graphics
processing image processing and
enterprise stuff as well but there's a
consumer slant to it too PNY was present
on the show floor PNY of course
manufacturers nvidia equipped video
cards and also makes SSDs so we took a
quick look at the SSDs on the show floor
just to sort of refresh everyone on
where PNY is with its current lineup so
the main one that's coming out shortly
it's not presently available but will be
soon is the CL for 111 which is the new
client SSD and this is sort of similar
in class and pricing structure to
Samsung's 850 Pro that many of you are
familiar with the 850 Pro and this new
client SSD offer a little more than
gaming grade SSDs and that would include
things like enhance security and
encryption and just generally better
hardware for four different processing
tasks PNY is SSDs come in a few forms so
looking at the client SSD strictly it
ships in 240 or 480 gigabyte capacities
using the SF 2281 controller which is a
tried-and-true sandforce control it's a
bit dated now it's actually several
years old because 3rd gen has still not
officially launched and then the 960
gigabyte model uses the silicon motion
controller the sm 2246 and that's a
pretty well-liked controller performs
well and has sort of started to gain
some market share as sandforce has
continued to age the silicon motion
controller has almost two times faster
random read iops for the client SSD by
PNY it's at 71,000 versus 40,000 using
the now Seagate branded sandforce
controller but the San for Swan does
over perform a bit with write IOPS at
eighty-five thousand verses 75,000 with
silicon motion the other SSD that's been
around for a bit is the cs2 111 gaming
SSD and this is sort of in the same line
as the accelerate drives that have been
around
for a while the gaming drive they showed
has a tiger painted on it's pretty cool
looking definitely targeted at the
gaming audience and this is why
something like the client drive comes
into play because the more professional
audience wants something that's a bit
more discreet and performs to a
different spec the gaming drive does use
the silicon motion controller the same
one that the 960 gigabyte version of the
client drive has and it's shipping at
240 480 and 960 gigabyte models so you
can find more information on this in the
link in the description below for the
article aside from this PNY have their
quadro cards on display of Korra SPECT
more for professional applications media
production and hardcore rendering and
processing so not super relevant to our
channel but always cool technology to
look into because it eventually works
its way down into the consumer market so
that is PNY is booth at the gtc show
floor check the link in the description
below for more information from gtc we
covered the launch of the GTX Titan ex
and I will see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
