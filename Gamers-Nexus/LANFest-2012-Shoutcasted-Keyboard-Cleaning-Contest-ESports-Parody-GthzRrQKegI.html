nexus donna and we are shout casting a
keyboard destruction and rebuilding
contest i haven't that land fest 2012
where the competitors had to take apart
and rebuild their keyboards and the
fastest person won a new keyboard so
this was a cleaning contest in effect
let's shoutcast this and here they go go
he says go they are off in the top left
we see a ten finger all incoming from a
blue jeep gentleman he will not be able
to recover from this by setting those
keep it he's fine all over the place I
don't know if he'll be able to get it
back together in time they are all over
the map right now in the middle right we
see a black and red mechanical keyboard
he is going for a similar strategy
except he has kept his keys closer
together and he only has 101 keys on his
keyboard as it is a standard 84 + Lomb
pad looking to the middle left we have
2g 11 keywords that are just barely able
to get their first keys at what an
embarrassment for g 11 users and it
looks like here what oh no oh do you see
what's whether he just got popped in the
face by his own key this is just so sad
for that player i don't know if you oh
oh there's a judge felt excuse me let me
interrupt for a judge call he says do i
have to take the special keys out they
say yes every key but the spacebar must
come out of your keyboard so red and
black mechanical is back in the running
he is trying to catch up and uh here he
is the first to officially take apart
his keyboard he is now beginning the
rebuild process you can see he is
trembling trying to stay ahead of the
other competitors who are close behind
him except for those on them the right
side here what are they doing why are
they in the show match with pro players
these guys have 0 3 4 KP m0k p.m. again
they just can't even get any keys out at
all this is just there is no chance in
hell that these far right players will
stay in what do we what we have here
though it looks like is a turtling
player he has snuck up from behind
everyone and took his keys apart very
neatly and kept them in the way that
they must go back in so he has
definitely given us some thought that
even the red black mechanical keyboard
player may not be able to keep up with
yet oh it looks this may be game this
might be it he's calling for a judge he
he has completed his keyboard and he
holds it up to be checked by the judge
let's see what the judge has to say this
is definitely a big mo no suspense for
all of the competitors I ain't gonna win
he says it's good he's here that man
wins with his keyboard here's these
clear strategy and will now be receiving
a new keyboard as a result so for more
far from land fest 2012 check into the
channel of course we have some much more
serious in her views but this was just a
fun keyboard contest I wanted you all to
see I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
