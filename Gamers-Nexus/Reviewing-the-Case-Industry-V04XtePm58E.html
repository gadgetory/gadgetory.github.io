we're talking about problems in the case
industry lack of innovation in the case
industry Rob worked as a former what
p.m. at NZXT case case p.m. so has
experience designing things like the H
440 yesterday nope h 440 s340 and then
going further back
phantom 530 source 530 h 630 cases which
810 phantom 820 I was in the mix for a
while yeah so he's he's got about seven
years of experience in the game with
cases I've been working with them for a
long time I'm not fully satisfied with
where cases are in the industry in
general right now so it's thought we
just lay some problems out or talk about
where the current direction is before we
get into that this content is brought to
you by the Thermaltake flow RGB
closed-loop liquid cooler which is a 360
millimetre radiator plus 3 120 fans that
are RGB illuminated if then we'll take
it rain fans at that this is a 4.5 done
a stack pump which is one of the faster
pumps you can learn more at the link in
the description below
quick note anything Rob says is his own
opinion so we'll just put that after
yeah not representing a company today so
where do we want to start I think we
were talking about general lack of
innovation which is probably a symptom
of a few things yeah like one being how
how far can you really push a case and I
feel like a lot of case manufacturers
are kind of in there like tween years
they like some of them gave it like a
real hard shot hard effort to try to get
case innovation and may not have
happened and then they're like oh well
we'll still the same amount of cases if
we just kind of turn one out anyway
right let's saw the same amount either
way and it's not our leading product for
a lot of people yeah a lot of these
companies have become much more
multifaceted you know when I joined the
industry I was told to look at an tech
and coolermaster and tech and
coolermaster were the two biggest case
names in the whole industry and you know
you look at how far we've come
I don't like when was last time you
recommended and
Tech case for purchase like seriously
recommended probably I know personally I
never have but well I I did probably the
antique nine hundred back when it was
like the case yeah when it was brand new
alright and that I built in that key
that was probably my one of my my second
or third personal system
so that's mid 2000s or something yeah so
yeah I don't know they've they've got
the p8 now which we're reviewing but
it's got some issues with it as well
just like all the other cases do you you
can see antics trying to break out but
really all they're doing is catching up
they're adding a power supply shroud
they're getting rid of optical drive
bays they're using a little bit less
plastic they're going to a more
squared-off dine like it's not there's
still a lot of the same tooling though
you get you can pull bits and pieces out
of the cases where you're like oh that
was in the whatever came out six years
ago okay yeah and if you're gonna start
to do that really all you're doing is
playing a numbers game you're like
alright helmet can I get all these
features in a shared chassis and sell it
for $39 right no that that's when it
gets interesting but if you're still
trying to sell it for like over $100
it's kind of it's kind of like an insult
I feel like the end user because now
that someone who's not in the know
someone who may not fully understand
what they're trying to purchase might
just be like Integra's good yeah an
antique was I mean they were genuinely
industry-leading
yeah okay there's a reason that they're
referenced and I they were one of the
first companies they might have been the
first company to do a non brown box box
for the case like as in art on the box
yeah that's how old antic is and that's
how leading-edge they were at the time
due my um my my first memories of antic
were always going to Fry's or micro
Center they had
the endcaps they'd have a whole pallet
stack yeah of cases and you'd see it
you're like that's the case you buy like
you could get a weirder oxide style led
like super funky admittedly NZXT back in
the day but right you knew if you bought
an antique you'd be fine and it's not
really the case anymore are they kind of
resting on their laurels yeah they've
they've definitely certainly in terms of
perception have kind of fallen from
visibility so now you've got companies
like Coursera has definitely stepped in
in a big way sure they have a huge
following a lot of fans they've got some
solid designs they have some flaws like
all the other companies but I feel like
we're an tech has faded a little bit and
fallen back in the industry
there's now coursers come forward NZXT
had a big creative growth definitely so
I don't start with Corsair next so what
do we think there first of all Corsair
was memory yep right then they got into
things like power supplies where they
really did quite well
liquid coolers liquid coolers cases so
they're one of the multi-faceted
companies we're talking you know the
courser story is one of my favorite just
speak like of course there was for a
long time always just a competitor of
mine in the industry but of course their
story is always really cool because they
managed to come out with the 800 d the
800 e was their first foray into cases
at the time you know really cases
weren't that expensive for like no one
was really spending that much money was
a big halo yeah it was a huge thing it
had multiple partitions on the inside it
was kind of set up for liquid cooling
what liquid cooling was back in the day
and it really it felt expensive like
they did a great job not feeling like a
turnkey but case but bigger I think made
an incredible good job in making it feel
like if you built a computer in this
it'd be worth more than the sum of its
component all right yeah and that that
was really incredible that they went did
that and then subsequently went on made
like the 600 T which is what like a cult
favorite of mine I can just they did
they started to do things that no one
was really thinking about at that time
yeah they started they they pushed
hinged doors a lot too yeah that was a
new with the mechanism on that 800 d I
remember being very serious
yeah it was robust and the 760 T was it
I think also had the more affordable
version of the hinge door yep with a
full like full panel acrylic window and
that was pretty new as well people have
certainly done these things in some form
or another but we're talking about
bringing it to like mass market even the
busiest I I seem to be fall in love with
all the the coarser cases that never
really took off in a mainstream the
stuff like the 380 T you know like it it
it wasn't perfect and it wasn't the best
optimal you know use of use of spending
for a case but it was really cool like
you looked at it you're like I don't
know any other case that looks like this
I don't know anything I could buy that
could be comparable to it
and that's why I really like what
coarser was doing with cases right yes
then modern Corsair we've got things
like 400 to 600 see what else they have
right now that's since it on honestly
since they changed the numbering scheme
up on these model numbers it's really
hard for me to follow Corsair
in terms of placing a name onto a
project well so generally speaking what
are things that with like with Coursera
talk about an tech some of the things
that uh you know they kind of fell on
like cable management for example and
I've never caught up there what about
Corsair where can they improve because I
I think Porsche is one of the few
companies where in our testing they
routinely do pretty well in thermals
there near can't say that for alot of
yeah of course there's definitely the
more responsible as leader these days
you're gonna get a good product no
matter what now I would say that Corsair
is almost the new antic that you can't
buy a bad Corsair case you know
certainly I'll leave
to you to do the reviewing but it's
really hard to be upset with the product
that you get out of course there there
could have been improvements they could
have done things better I'll always
think that of course but they do a
pretty good job the problem with that is
you end up with a middle of the line
product in a lot of ways you don't get a
lot of new innovation out of it
Corsair tends to use a design firm for a
lot earth at their solutions they're not
in-house design right of course they're
managed by a Corsair but middle of the
line is really what what I seem to get a
lot out of it you get the current trends
that are coming up stuff like decent and
inoffensive yeah yeah they try to be a
little funky with stuff like what was
the newer boxy case that came out the
huge one yeah that had almost like the
little alien sculpted was it wasn't at a
tee yes there's 500 tee time I like a
Computex that just past it's been out
for like a year or so but you know you
get you get a little bit of funkiness
enough that you know it'll sell you know
that no one's gonna be upset with it
right and then a pretty good case but I
haven't I really would love to see
coarser do something really fresh really
new but this isn't always in their
wheelhouse you know yeah well they've
gotten with coarser seems like they
certainly follow trends pretty
effectively not not in an offensive or
insulting no but they definitely catch
up on trends quickly which some other
companies don't catch up as fast on the
trends that's you know bad for them but
trend-setting companies say we should
probably give in win some credit in win
has i i'm curious how that's actually
translated cleaning to sales for them
but i they came in really hard with the
glass like in one came to market with
glass and it was it the towel the towel
was like the first yeah they're only
showed at Computex with all that glass
and they were one of the they were the
first that sticks in my mind with doing
tempered glass yeah seriously as they
did and other companies caught up pretty
quickly I mean last year's copy that's
not not 2017 but
20:16 had tempered glass on probably 30%
of the cases oh and a lot of the the
China sourced direct him to customer
case manufacturers now - they figured
all we could change the stud on the side
panel and put a temper yeah John Jones
for example is a great example they make
the Rose well : n which is the same as
the entities crystal yeah and a lot of
the case is just like with peripherals
there's a lot of rebrand going on and
companies can differentiate it a little
bit but depending on which company
you're looking at which product it is
like if it's pretty cheap and it looks
like it has good features it's probably
because it's sourced from somewhere else
sure and you know especially like a
company with Rose well they're banking
on good reviews know if you get in at a
low price and people buy it and they're
not unhappy with the amount of money
they've just spent for that product it's
gonna have great reviews it's gonna have
great return business lots of people are
gonna end up consuming that yeah but at
the end of the day you know this is
we're really this is like case snobbery
yeah talking about me picking here on a
lot of these things you know it's it
becomes about how much further the
industry could have pushed it and what
else could you've gotten more for your
money and you know I think airflow is
probably one of the biggest problems
right now definitely there's a lot of
things being overlooked to get this
style yes this costs come in under
budget well not even just that I mean
it's it's not expensive to cut holes in
a case true so but to make it look good
you know you end up with only a couple
scenarios on how to get enough holes and
make it look good and that's usually you
know either you put vents on the side or
you put Vince on the top and then you
leave a blank front
yeah because mesh is expensive and well
also there's just a style thing yeah
everyone thinks ever since
feels like ever since the s340
everyone's trying to do flat like single
color no mesh front panel I'll walk it
I'll walk it back even further than that
and I'll give credit to fractal because
I remember working on NZXT when you know
the define r2 was out and then the r3
came out and it was like if it was black
and nondescript people were losing their
right I like do you understand how hard
it could be to work at NZXT
earlier and then when fractal becomes a
popular thing and everybody's like I
don't want that transformer I don't want
that girl there I don't want that style
and ID I can you just make it simple and
a black box yeah and I have it not break
and be kind of quiet and the fractal was
killing it back then absolutely killing
it like I think fractal contributes as
much to Corsair as being the killer of
Coolermaster right in tech back in the
day yeah that was a huge bullet and
these giant companies was this simple
design and when NZXT came out this 340
in the h 440 like it was so hard to try
to walk that line of having a design a
unique design that wasn't just the
fractal right look yeah well especially
because ultimately you're trying to
differentiate yourself from the OEMs
like Dell yeah someone like that and
their boxes are pretty plain yeah
playing black but up a good fight we're
playing better yeah and so if that's
what you're competing with the kind of
lose sight of the ID product but I mean
on the intake side of things like
pulling recent examples the Antec p8 the
EVGA dg7 that we just looked at and then
the video I was talking about it
DG seven p8 the oh the even the Corsair
review 21 or thirty-one whatever it is
it's not Corsair thermaltake view 21 or
31 those cases all have the one thing in
common which is like flat front panel
and then it's like they forgot the other
part which is you have to have mesh so
to the point where in some of our
reviews we'll see
the GPU starts dropping clocks unless
you set a custom fan curve and I don't
know how much of that is like trying to
follow the fractal and NZXT example
without realizing you need a cooling
element it's like they look at the
broader strokes it's like alright simple
design power supply shroud no plastic
right less plastic
and then try to update it like oh well
this case was from three years ago
well now we have tempered glass we could
take that plus tempered glass done
since instant success and really that's
kind of it's frustrating to me and to
most end users probably not not as much
you know I remember reading the comments
to most people were just frustrated
didn't have like rubber grommets and now
yeah these were things that that always
seemed kind of silly to me but I I love
the NZXT was able to make such a far
leap forward with the H 440 in the s 340
and it's like we're still kind of stuck
in a that era right now that refresh
cycles have slowed down yeah we're for
everybody
oh yeah men's exp has been I mean the
last case was the Manta yeah right let
me try T about even an ATX case and you
know everybody has kind of slowed down
and and what they can put in there and
so you end up with these like refresh
with flat tempered glass yeah any fresh
and powers flash and power supply strap
I'm even Silverstone Silverstone has
really done a good job at staying the
line of like our company is about
function to the point where we'll meet
up with them at an event this was
probably last year's CES and the the
PM's were asking me if you are asking me
do you think we should add RGB to this
and I was like I don't know man they're
like what do you think about RGB and
tempered glass and they ultimately caved
and started adding that stuff it's I
mean and I'm like be fair silver stones
been doing Ravens for a while - it's not
yeah well they're not in on chasing that
gamer yeah they definitely chase it but
they they do try it well like the Raven
o - you know it was functional for sure
but it also looks like gamer yeah so 50%
plastic oh yeah
you know it I think I think people's
companies definitely struggle without
having I think we've seen that that top
tier pricing fall off yeah like you
can't sell $200 case anymore
like that's phantom 820 a phantom 820
could never exist like it's which I tena
was expensive to attend was like 180 170
but things like like cosmos is coming
back yeah she does have 100 P it's gonna
be what like three hundred dollars three
hundred bucks so yeah and it's you could
or it like the feet are really cool and
the buckle the side panels are cool but
the interior looks like a rope an
erector set like it's oh and it is one
it's super functional completely modular
you know not everyone needs that kind of
like the be quiet dark Bass Pro 900 you
can do a lot of the same stuff you can
invert the motherboard tray or rotate it
and that gets you up to a 200 or 250
dollar case which it's got a lot of cool
features like it's a well-designed case
but also you pay a lot for that
functionality yeah when you win when you
can do purpose-built correctly you end
up with a much better product that's
more for a specific type of customer
well yeah and even like that's getting
into territory where see 700 P and dark
base pro 900 both have really cool
features in that you can you know
modularize them I'll say but the the
difference is like where the s3 40 tries
to differentiate by doing clean design
and a power supply shroud these are
differentiating by adding features that
cost like an extra hundred dollars to
buy companies are struggling with being
creative under a budget yes that's for
sure
you know s 340 and H 440 we keep coming
back to and the majority of the money
spent on on those products to their
costs was the tooling yeah if you look
at them the tooling first off it's not
shared with any other case and there's
things they try to reduce the amount of
rivet holes unnecessary holes just
anything that might make the product
look more utilitarian and they try to
made it make it look more like a
consumer finished product inside
outlet everything about it looks tip-top
inside sexy outside sexy what do we
think of the what are the aspects of
cases that it seems like companies are
spending an unnecessary amount of money
I'm like where's where are the aspects
that are you look at it and you go that
was a poor allocation of Matic like in
every scenario this was like at NZXT it
was really great because they were
always open to trying and doing things
so phantom 820 is a great example right
of spending a lot of money on features
that sound cool that that was acting
that was a case I really liked
originally but now I wouldn't give it a
good review exactly and so it's
something like II as a person working to
develop it you were like alright we've
got this great chassis same chassis as
switch 8:10 let's put the Phantom style
new phantom style on it yeah let's put
interior RGB LED and that was new yeah
you had the lighting controller but the
thing is runner millimeter fans in the
front yep yep and at the end of the day
though what it was was a lot of plastic
it was an LED controller that wasn't
completely ready for primetime
it was way ahead of it there's a few
version one right yeah technically yeah
you know the hue ended up coming out
after and being better than the
electronics Kashyap I remember that but
this is kind of like the fallacy of
buying a flagship case just like if you
were to buy a ten-year-old hundred
thousand dollar car it feels old now
back then it was like just trying to
innovate and what I like now what it
would why why I like these cheaper cases
that that seemed so nice is it it's like
all right what could you do in steel
what could you do with the least amount
of material what could you do to attract
the most amount of customer right I
think that's such a great puzzle to try
to make a great end-user product like I
really like making products and under
hundred dollars to make something so
cool yeah that's the challenge yeah yeah
and if you see a lot of it's been
stripped out it comes down to core
competency right now it cases you're not
getting fan control built into cases
you're not getting led
in the cases fan control was really
popular yeah that was you know was in
unnecessary as a p.m. there were things
that was like oh this is over a hundred
dollars you have to have rubber grommets
oh you have to have fan control do you
have temperature readouts do a
temperature probes you have multiple
channels you have many watts was it was
like a rabbit hole of spending money on
things that you're never gonna do as
well as the discrete product like that's
what cases were for so long motherboard
or Ivan a quarter-inch yeah add-ins yeah
and so you know you thought you were
adding value by doing things that a case
wasn't supposed to do and now cases have
become so much more pure you don't even
have an optical drive to enable these
rings and they're still not popular to
be built into a case I I like that we're
getting back to like a core
functionality of the case but I would
you know it's been a few years I'd like
to see something really kind of yeah I
don't the H 500 P is really popular
right now with viewers and people online
yeah so that one is interesting because
it's mixing old and new elements the old
being 200 millimeter fans those were so
popular with the half act and like
Phantom Menace NZXT panel yeah and they
just vanished so it was such a yeah 10
now they're coming back people are
trying to bring them back I don't know
if they'll come back but I think the
question is before you you think about
is it good that they're coming back the
question is why did they go away oh
there's a lot I actually someone asked
us on reddit a couple months ago
I mean first off there were two specs
just just like if anybody has ever
bought a 140 millimeter radiator there's
like a whole space like there are these
issues that should have just never
existed just because there were multiple
manufacturers and so like NZXT had one
size and I think they were aligned with
another company with like 193 spec and
then there were 180 and then there were
also 200 and they were all falling under
two they're also 220 fans yeah yeah and
so that the thinking was like okay well
to make a fan the same width as most
cases most cases are about 200
millimeters that's great like this is
gonna be your peak fan size you're gonna
go from an 8
to a 120 to 140 theoretically quieter
yeah eventually you would ascend to a
200 millimeter fan but the problem was
first off that meant that you had to
take up Z height so like you wouldn't be
able to clear the motherboard and have a
200 millimeter fan unless you're very
tall or very wide right then you had
bearing issues these blades were very
heavy and so you needed a heavier duty
bearing to run them but that cost money
and consumers generally don't want to
spend more money on top of the already
least amount for the fan blade so you
know to buy a good 200 millimeter fan
could be $25 $30 and then on top of that
radiator support wasn't very good they
there's no radiators yeah you know like
if you look even at one 40s it was
difficult to get good fans for 140
millimeter radiators for a while to do
it look 200 was like very difficult so
yeah I mean optimally you'd have a
radiator the same width as the fan but
also they're not they're not really
static pressure ah yeah yeah that's a
big the death so you weren't beat it fit
on there but I wouldn't see the same
performance so I think cooler masters
may be chasing something that's not
really there anymore with those 200
millimeter fans but that'll be an
interesting one because I think the case
will it looks okay I think it'll sell
because there's a lot of interest in it
it does a good job showing off the RGB
LEDs yeah I think a lot of it is like is
centralizing your LEDs and kind of just
two spots in the front so it doesn't you
don't see all the individual diodes like
you would with three friends yeah
they've got the big clear like acrylic
window or whatever it is I think there's
tempered glass on one side so I've got a
lot of the design elements that people
want or at least have the industry's
trending in what's the price on it
I think it's specially 150 so that's
where it's like that's the question
though is it's like when consumer
stopped buying SUVs like it might it
might just be too expensive I don't know
anybody who's buying cases over
thirty dollars now that's the thing
right like there's a lot of just like
the interesting thing is we can look at
things like coverage viewership yeah and
I can look at the coverage of a great
example as our Vega coverage and we got
more views on the review than products
that have shifts to date yeah right and
so and there's probably more interest in
the product expressed online than ever
will people ever people buy it there's
more interest in the H 500 P I think
then will be expressed in dollars spent
buying it and so it's really hard to
gauge right now how well it'll perform
when when when you're a case p.m. this
is like the biggest difficulty to
because you want to be a part of the
community so you're towing like
overclockers thought net or a power up
your OSI UK read some reddit sub reddits
build a PC and you hear all these things
and if you hear them twice in a day
you're like this is the thing I need to
put into my case and then 810 months
later you put it out and people are like
oh I'm gonna buy this case because of
these things and then it's just the
comments section yeah they don't
actually buy it that's that's probably
or only the conscious bias
yeah which is still not a lot of people
it's such a subjective product people
are very vocal about it you may have won
over those comments section people but
they're not always right but that's on a
magnitude also of hundreds not of
thousands one hundred hundreds doesn't
pay for cost and at the end of the day I
don't I don't know if your viewers have
a good a good sense but you need to be
selling like three to seven thousand of
these a month to make it worth your
while like you can sell less if it's a
rebranded products like those Jones both
matter a little product yeah we care
yeah you build everything into the cost
but if you're coming to the market and
you spent months years of Rd a lot of
effort into your design and features and
your marketing you need to be shipping
at least 3,000 easy
to try to recoup your money and you
start to think you need to ship 3000 a
month for several years that's a really
wide audience and it takes a really
special product to get that kind of
attention yeah and that's why you got so
much to land reuse - it's definitely why
companies are more afraid of spending
money on tooling for four cases right so
what's our recap here what are the
things that I would like to see airflow
improved on the front panels I would
really like for companies like when we
when we post reviews we've started
including frequency trend lines now yeah
because just saying it's hotter doesn't
work with these people like you got to
show that it's losing something in
addition to being hotter so GPU
temperature yeah we can ramp the fan to
70% and it's fine maybe we need a like
do you want a 60 DB a fan in your case
maybe you need to do like a summarize
performance metric for cases that a
number for the the decibel level a
number for the thermal level right like
a a subjective like a I don't know yeah
port card yeah yeah you know something
so that you could categorize these cases
I think the case industry is gonna be
booming soon though just be quiet you
we've got all these new processors
coming out coffee like yeah coffee Red
River coffee Lake is supposed to be very
very good if if it is that good I think
we'll see a lot of Sandy Bridge people
upgrading and you'll get this tidal wave
of people ready to spend money on the
industry and I hope companies are ready
with some new offerings to get them
excited yeah yeah what's if you pick one
thing out of the stack for improvement
well what would you want people to work
on
I think it's designing for the core
competency it's making look for for that
specific company it's a case the cases
job in my mind actually isn't housing
the components it's making the building
process better ease of installation of
installation and then the final product
aesthetics that the the computer looks
good right we always figured out how to
make the next case when we do the show
builds with the current case
so like CES Computex builds when you get
hands are all bloody and cut off and
you're trying to snip off zip ties that
shouldn't be mounted to certain parts of
the case and then you're like all out of
zip type point here oh we should pre
install the standoffs oh we should make
this out of metal and I'll plastic that
velcro oh they exactly exactly and you
know a fan hub is just as good as a fan
controller let that kind of stuff I want
to see a return to core competency all
right thank you rob for joining no
problem Steve I'll see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
