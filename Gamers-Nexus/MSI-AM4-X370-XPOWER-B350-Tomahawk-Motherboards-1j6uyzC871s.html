we've seen thus far for Andy's
forthcoming Zen architecture and the
a.m. for boards that we saw we're hosted
by MSI at CES 2017 they were the X 370
titanium overclocking board at a be 350
mid-range board before getting to that
this coverage is brought to you by
Thermaltake and their core p3 chassis
which now has a tempered glass
alternative you can find a link in the
description below because it serves a
good test bench as well starting with
the X 370 titanium the main things to
point out about this board immediately
would it be the power setup so if you
look near the CPU there's an 8 + 4 power
pin setup so that's your traditional EPS
12 volt 8 pin and then an additional 4
pin and that is for extra overclocking
power I don't have hard specs for how
much power can be driven to the CPU
through this board or how much the CPU
might want because AMD hasn't really
told us yet but it's there if you want
it the other board the b3 50 uses just a
typical 8 pin setup so this is something
special to the titanium series we look
at the south of the board you'll see an
extra 6 pin PCI II header on the
motherboard and that is to provide power
to the PCIe slots for graphics
overclocking this is something we've
seen in the past for example EVGA x99
classified also has this set up and that
helps by providing more power of course
the GPU it can take some load off of the
PCIe bus as well for power transfer
depending on what's configured and how
much overclocking you're trying to do
walking around the board this one gets
rid of a lot of the sort of less
functional features for example the RGB
LEDs there are none that's a good thing
this is an overclocking focus board they
don't care about things like that for
this unit you'd have to look at the Pro
carbon series which will exist for am 4
but hasn't been shown yet so since there
are none of these sort of non functional
features functional features we have
include the typical OC button that's
located in the bottom right of the board
it can toggle so you can actually swivel
the button and rotate it to use
different pre-programmed to overclock
settings that you program through the
software and that's done through MSI's
gaming software as usual next to that
your typical power and reset buttons
nothing special there there's a CMOS
reset button on the back if you care
about it and we have some b-roll of the
i/o the rear i/o you can just look at
that and figure out how many different
ports there are and that gives us some
early insight as
to the lane availability since Andy
hasn't given us much yet for Zen or for
the X 370 chipset the X 370 X power
titanium is either an 8 + 4 vrm design
or 6 plus 2 MSI told us both numbers but
you can see b-roll of the vrm for now
and we'll look at it more closely with
build Zoid in the future the X power
Titanium's of erm is capable of handling
well over 250 amps from what MSI tells
us flipping the board over you'll see in
these shots that there's a MUX setup on
the back so this is what would allow in
theory anyway for the 16 lanes from the
CPU to be split off into 2 by 8 so if
you want to do multi-gpu set up these
are the chips that would handle it kind
of like when you look at a PLA expects
chip on any other board that does this
type of thing and I don't have a price
for the X power titanium motherboard yet
we don't have any prices for anything
related to a m4 or Zen go figure but
it'll be up there this one will
definitely be a more expensive board
just by looking at it you can see the
component quality and focus on
overclocking does mean it will be a bit
more expensive the be 350 board is the
one that's supposed to be cheaper that's
the tomahawk so this is another line
that exists for MSI you can find a
tomahawk boards with the Intel 200
series chipsets if you want an idea of
how they stack up versus the pro carbon
and things like that in terms of price
but the tomahawk is a be 350 chipset and
it is also more limited in its
overclocking endeavors so one of those
examples the most obvious one would be
the vrm the BRM for the tomahawk is a 4
+ 2 setup and that one is about a 200
amp throughput so I don't know what kind
of overclocking will be enabled on B 350
but depending on that it's probably
plenty of power we'll see I really have
to have the chip in hand and test it to
tell you it seems fine though now other
things on the board I suppose the PCIe
slots below them you might have noticed
that there's PCI slots two of them
knotti just PCI so why is that there
well it's for from what MSI tells us
it's emerging markets which is common
that's something normally like China
market would use these serial ports comm
ports things like that you'll sometimes
find them on new motherboards the reason
is often just because they need to
support a wide
market then the US Europe where they
might be using those older devices
whether it's for industrial use or just
because they happen to have a lot of
them and use them so to that end not
only is PCI on there but there's also a
combo port where you can hook up those
legacy printers if you so desired in
terms of things that are relevant for
gaming it's really just a pretty
straightforward motherboard it looks
like maybe ideally with one GPU I'm not
sure what the Lane setup will be the
muxing was a bit different versus the
titanium which you would expect vrm is a
lot simpler it does have the reinforced
slots I guess which on memory one thing
here you'll notice that these
motherboard vendors now are all putting
the sort of steel or armor plating on
PCIe and on their memory slots on PCIe
it makes a little bit of sense because
if you're an SI and you ship a unit
maybe there's some concern with it
falling out ripping the slot out of the
board more likely what happens is a few
people have pulled on the cards too hard
without releasing the clip and then they
rip the PCIe slot of the motherboard
more likely still is that it's just
marketing at least Islamic sent on the
memory this one is not for reinforcement
physically as much as it as it is just
extra grounding points and that's
something we'll talk about more in the
future whether or not it's relevant but
that's really all we have for you in
terms of the two motherboards that MSI
had you can find a link in the
description below for more information
and we hopefully will have some more Zen
or rise in information coming out of
this show so as always patreon link in
the post well video to help us out
directly thank you for watching link the
description below subscribe for more
I'll see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
