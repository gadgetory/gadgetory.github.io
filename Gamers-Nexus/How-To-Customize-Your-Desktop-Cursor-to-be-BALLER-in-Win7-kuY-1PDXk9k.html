and this is dr. gong and we're gonna
talk about how to customize your desktop
to make it look baller just like it
should for starcraft 2 and dr. gone why
would you want to do that with your
desktop good questions to you the
monotony of the windows 7 theme is
already accentuated on the fact that
it's it's already accentuate oh really
so we're putting this off on it's
microsoft's fault that's good enough
yeah it can be my casa fault and uh as
you guys can see here my desktop
background is currently an Archon from
starcraft 2 obviously what else would it
be I physical and yes dr. gone what is
your favorite starcraft 2 unit i would
like to say that blue flame hey leion
but at a SI am surg i must admit that
the wiggly brood lords are my favorite
unit you know my favorite unit is dr.
gone i could say something very obscene
but I Rochelle just lady the answer is
larva that's so Opie way too much health
I wish too much armor yes so we're going
to customize your your windows theme to
be just like Starcraft you or whatever
you want you can change it it's pretty
simple we're going to go download a
patcher it'll essentially change core
windows files that allow you to
implement that new theme because before
Windows 7 didn't allow it the patcher
will be in the description below so just
download it it's called the universal
theme patcher i will be running the x 64
bit version you run 32 or 64 as is
appropriate once you have it downloaded
you just go and launched it it will pop
up a dialog box choose English hit ok it
tells you this report says if you need
the patch not click yes I do need to
patch and then you have these 3 patch
buttons that for you should be available
from either grayed out because I already
patched it prior to changing any windows
core files dr. gone will you tell us
what our users should do they should
grab coconuts put lemon in it put
bananas tomatoes and a little serving
chicken parm
so unless you wanna see what a full
description of how to make chicken
permission and then I can just send you
to my mom and my mom will tell you you
know I think we should do a video of
that next time for sure let's let's
definitely do one of those if you guys
think that's a good idea and you want to
see how to do that click the like button
so we'll know or thumbs up whatever
YouTube does the correct answer that was
you should always update all of your
files you go to do a system restore
create a restore point just in case
click those patch buttons all three of
them you can close this once it's
patched and now we are going to actually
get that theme on there for realz yo so
we can go and download this midnight
theme that is a free theme for windows 7
you can find anything you want a lot of
them are on deviantart they're free
click download and once it's downloaded
you just go find where you did it you
saved it and unzip go to that folder go
to the to uh we're going to look for
let's see i already have it loaded so
i'm going to pull up where you should go
so once you unzip it go to your folder
with the themes just keep that open on
the side for now open up a new window go
to see just like i am here windows
resources and themes and if you can't
see this for some reason you probably
have your files hidden so you just go to
push the alt button click on tools
folder options view and make sure all of
these show hidden folders are available
that way you can see it so you see here
that i already have the midnight theme
copied over and again we're just in see
windows resources themes grab your
downloaded midnight theme copy it and
paste it or drag and drop over to your
themes windows folder so it'll look just
like mine is go inside you should see
these folders and the midnight ms styles
and once all of that's done we get on to
the next part of actually applying that
theme so go ahead and right-click your
desktop click personalize and you'll see
you have my themes if you have one
selected and save that theme just in
case you like it and then you can revert
to later
scroll down you will see installed
themes and that's going to be where
midnight or the other one you download
it appears click on that it'll apply and
then you're ready to do customizations
like the background I have or like the
mouse cursor and dr. gone why should
people change what their cursor looks
like that is an obvious question
actually I will tell you the obvious
answer because whenever you have
starcraft open and you want to close
starcraft you close it and you will
never realize you actually closed it so
you will feel like the most starcraft s
person in the world that is correct so
we're going to change that cursor this
is also easy just go ahead and download
a starcraft 2 cursor set or whatever
game you want to make it i'm sure
there's some kind of cursors for Skyrim
that will be available at some point and
go to you know go to Google your
favorite browser or find it download it
and once you've done that we're simply
going to take those cursors as I have
here in my custom desktop folder grab
the cursor set and we see inside here
there's a 24 pixel version and a large
version keep that open to the side open
control panel go to mouse and click on
pointers and now you'll see that you
should unless you've customized it
before you should have none selected
which looks like this the typical black
and white cursor click on normal select
then click browse and you see here in
the drop-down that we are in see windows
cursors with that information you can
close this window open up another new
window go to see windows cursors and you
can take your new starcraft 2 or Skyrim
or whatever Chris you're set copy it
paste it over here just like I've done
here and I put it in a new folder so
it's not too cluttered and going to that
new folder and hear all your cursors
after you've done all of this you can go
back to your mouse properties window if
you closed it just control panel mouse
and then pointers click on normal select
click browse se too small for me or
whatever your folder is and then i'll
choose SC two cars are small and that's
how it happens you can also do this for
each of the other ones they should be
named appropriately by the creator so we
have a help select we have working in
the background and all of those once you
do this for all of them or most of them
I believe there's not a handwriting one
you can always make more but it's okay
to just leave the evil ones default that
you don't have once you do all this
click save as type a name for your
scheme and save it and then whenever you
want to revert to this theme or remove
it all together you can do so and you
still have their the back up click apply
and ok and that'll set your cursor so
now that you've done the cursor and the
desktop or the theme of the desktop you
can grab your wallpaper which is pretty
easy to do and a doctor gone can you
tell us what your current wallpaper is
or what your future wallpaper will be my
current wallpaper is one very nice girl
looking at a city but my next wallpaper
will be Destiny's background for
surrogates that lived for this warm
swarm for the live yes yes there we go
you're a killer man aggregator after
you've done if you find your background
which hopefully you've done by now
through our horrible horrible jokes you
just right click it and I'll do a demo
here with this one set as desktop
background and then click stretch or
whatever you want to do their Center
everyone mostly knows this so now you've
got a complete desktop you might be
noticing that your taskbar isn't
completely centered like mine if that is
the case right-click the taskbar click
properties go to taskbar buttons and
she's always combined hide labels which
it can be annoying for productivity but
it looks cool so we're going to do it
for now and then you can unlock the
taskbar Center it if you want to just
like I've done here and the way I did
that was I right clicked it
go to toolbars new toolbar and create a
folder anywhere you want so I named mine
blank toolbar select that folder like I
did here or unclick show text and
unclick show title then you just repeat
that process drag one on the left side
of your toolbar like this well I've
already got one over there but drag one
on the left side and do one on the right
side and then you just drag these
sliders closer and you can Center it
however you want it to be now mine still
says blank one tool bar because I
already have two on here so I'm just
going to remove that one and once we've
removed the unnecessary ones there you
go and now we can just drag and center
however you like just like that and once
you're done with that right click and do
lock the taskbar again and that's it for
the custom themes next we will have a
custom login screen so whenever you turn
your computer on you'll see a cool
background pop-up or a different control
the lead screen you're familiar with
when you hit ctrl delete if you do it
right now in the typical windows 7 arrow
theme it'll pop up a blue background
with the lock and taskbar and all that
stuff so we'll show you that next video
will also show hopefully custom sounds
so if you want to you can make it sound
like a ghost saying it's getting too hot
instead of that dink you have a marine
yelling blah and all that could you're
talking about you're talking about food
where my friend now it's the ghost at
yoga every time he died so he doesn't
happen as often the ghost is quite
dramatic in his death of course we all
prefer the good old high tambourine oh
yeah right yes yes we do tennety or high
templar impression for us there no no
you you must do it I am now I am no good
at head temporary impressions I'm afraid
you guys will have to wait for that
impression next time because we are over
our time so definitely look out for our
custom login screen and our high templar
impressions once we've perfected them
hopefully that tutorial work for you if
you have any problems just comment and

questions for you be sure
