nexus Donette we were at day 3 of pax
prime 2013 and there's actually a fourth
day of this year which is new i'm here
with bob stewart from vs Montcalm he
worked on the Rose well-thrown
industrial case we actually did a video
on this case previously with boo from
roseville and Bob what can you tell me
about the case how did what did Rose
will ask for when they approached you
they first met with us at CES and they
had a new case coming out the throne it
wasn't on the market yet and so they
just sent us kind of you know one of the
first ones and they and they wanted
something really awesome and they
weren't sure what they wanted so they
pretty much just said whatever you want
to do what can you tell us about the the
paint techniques use any special modding
techniques you had to employ here so
this was quite a bit of work a lot of
sleepless nights and there is actually
to start with this thing weighs in at
close to a hundred pounds so it's not
something you want to drag to a land
party really although we did make a
special crate for that has wheels and
everything so makes it easier but it's
had sheetmetal work throughout inside
and out and then we've done some
basically some fake welding on here and
we just wanted to simulate kind of a
rough industrial look in fact we named
it the throne industrial and so
everything we did throughout we wanted
to make it really rough and tough and
rugged and just kind of you know we kind
of went away from this super clean and
perfect look a little bit and things
like that so we have had a little bit of
feedback here and there on the welds and
and some comments on the quality of our
welds and things like that and you know
it's funny because they're actually not
real well so it's actually a compliment
when we see what kind of shitty welding
job we did and the fact that they think
it's a shitty well door it's a good well
it doesn't matter the fact that they
think it's a real well is it just tells
me we did our job because it's just
totally fake and however it looks real
and so you know we put in a lot of
little you know scabs welds and stuff
like that and then airbrushed in all the
burn marks and things like that and then
we kind of followed the theme all the
way through and so we did some expanded
metal on the front and then on the top
here and use some use some square bar
and wire you know just did some wire
feed welding some real welding on that
and then we we wanted to look rough as
well so what we did here was we just
left the rough welds and then we
clear-coated it so that it would match
kind of the theme that we had going on
the rest of it and everything so one of
the other things we did is you know we
always want to have a nice site window
to show off all the good stuff inside so
we had a that's actual real safety glass
wired safety glass you could punch it or
whatever you want you're not going to
break through it so
that also adds about 20 pounds to the
way to this day so all of the hardware
inside is all stainless steel so we
probably have about I would guess about
three hundred dollars just in two little
bolts and washers and all that kind of
thing it's just all stainless steel it
adds up fast and then the brackets we
made out of stainless steel perforated
metal and so everything that you look at
is either stainless steel or or aluminum
yeah we just followed that theme all the
way through created a new power supply
cover and things like that to match the
rest of the case and and so and then on
the back side we've got the name the
throne industrial painted and things
like that so and as I understand there's
a lot of machine work in here as well so
we're going to jump to a clip with rod
where we'll talk more about the machine
work and check all the links in the
description below for BS mod calm and of
course full article coverage alright so
now we are back with rod Rosenberg same
from BS mods calm he worked on the
machine work for the throne wrote
industrial case can you tell me more
about some of the custom machine work he
did what was you know what really was
pushing you in the project to show your
best efforts sure so we have a whole
industrial look so part of it was making
the metal look good we did a lot of work
with the custom case feet they're
machined out of solid block of aluminum
drawn up in Sketchup in a machine on a
CNC machine we also put a lot of focus
on the band girls they're all weld out
of steel we put 8 inch bar on the sides
to accent amount make them look like
they were all trimmed out and then left
all the weld marks and just clearcoat
over them the match the rest of the
theme can you tell me more about the
machining process itself for for our
readers who are interested in case
modding so for the machine machine is
really expensive we were lucky to have
access to a machine shop to do that
machine work we had to spend a lot of
time drawing it makes for a fit and then
a lot of prep work with the metal what
sort of software goes into designing the
the different components for the case
most of it was all designed with Google
Sketchup which is now owned by Trimble
so you can download that for free from
Trimble's website and it's actually
pretty easy to use do you have any
anything in here that you really want to
draw attention to that you feel like is
easily overlooked I think a lot the
wiring a lot of people see the big flex
conduit on the side of the case and they
think it's water cooling lines and it's
just regular flex conda's used in
hospitals and stuff to cover electrical
wiring you can buy at Home Depot and it
covers the six pin and eight pin power
connectors for the video cards very cool
and when you when you showed the case
two rows well when they saw for the
first time what was the reaction like I
think they were surprised with how heavy
it was and in the front glass and then
maybe the rough appearance a lot of
people think it'll be a showpiece it'll
be a car it'll be all waxed and shiny
but but this one's a little bit rough to
give the industrial theme what can you
tell me about this front piece right
here what's what's going on over here
and up here so in the front and top
panels we put an hour meter in that
records all the time that the system is
powered on we also had a hard drive
activity light and a custom power light
and then we put a voltage regulator a
voltmeter on the front that monitors the
5 volt and 12 volt power right off the
power supply along with a push button
that turns the strobe light on and off
very cool and I think boo showed us a
controller to control the LEDs in the
system can you tell me more about how
that's rings up sure so the LEDs in this
they're 16 feet of RGB LED throughout
the case it goes across the top across
the front and around the window those
LEDs are red green blue individual LEDs
and there are controlled by control it
sits in the five and a quarter bay and
has a 32 key remote to control any color
light you want any anything you want to
put out to aspiring modders out there
you know any advice you can give them on
getting started
it doesn't take a lot of money it takes
time it takes a file some plastic parts
and a can of paint and your rate Ahmad
awesome once again rod and Bob from BS
mods we have another video linked below
that talks about how you can get into
modding some basic overview stuff so
check that out check out the full
article coverage and I will see you guys
next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
