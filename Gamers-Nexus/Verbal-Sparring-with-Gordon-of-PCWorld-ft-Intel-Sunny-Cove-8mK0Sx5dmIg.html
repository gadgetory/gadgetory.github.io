this round Gordon you're the new host
guys steve from gamers nexus here uh so
let me ask you Gordon do you think this
is enough to convince everybody that
Intel's back is until bad I feel like
it's a trick questions everyone I'm
joined by Gordon now so Gordon is a
frequent attendee for everybody there if
I get enough miles I get a free episode
that's actually that is how it works in
fact I was on a PC worlds YouTube
channel not long ago for the Intel New
York event and Gordon you played the
role of the Internet I am going to play
the internet again we of course are at
Intel's architecture Day 2018 big news
for probably PC desktop people before
that this video is brought to you by
Emma sighs Meg Z 390 ace motherboard
which primarily offers high frequency
memory support for forty five hundred
megahertz kids and tight timings tuning
but also comes equipped with a twelve
phase V core vrm it ready for the ninety
nine hundred K a pre-installed IO shield
and an infinity mirror for RGB LEDs atop
the Left heatsink the RGB LED is
synchronized with Emma's eyes mystic
light to support RGB and rainbow LED
strips using the infinity mirror to
cascade lighting learn more at the link
in the description below we just give
you the view Steve's video on this to
find out all the details and Gordon's
article and gorn's article wherever PC
roll calm sunny Cove next generation
core followed by willow Cove and then
the last one that I'm sure people are
gonna make fun of will be golden Cove
that's right Holden Cove just too easy
to make fun of you know what that means
I can't say it's a family podcast but
I'm the Internet I'm playing the
Internet this is not my opinion I'm just
saying he's innocent here I'm innocent
I'm just saying the next generation
Intel party until the saying 10
nanometre come out some point it's worse
it's three worse than TSM see Steve is
three worse it's three digits worse it's
seven better than ten nine ten how do we
your math checks out Gordon that checks
and that I'm gonna say that what else am
I gonna say we've done
we've done the solder thing we've done
that good so I think I think the biggest
one that the internet will be counting
about now is a 10 nanometer that's
that's been on the on the books for a
while is it is it too little too late
of course it's gonna be 3 less it's
gonna be 3 less if it won't have is it
won't be cheap enough we know that right
you won't be cheap enough and never be
cheap it can never be cheap enough
because no matter what it has to be
cheaper and even if it's really cheap it
has to be cheaper than that so it can't
win that battle and the problem won't be
able to buy it any one day one and but
the good news is maybe we can get
somebody to benchmark it in a way that
we want to benchmark it you know like a
pie or somebody doing let me ask you
then what what do you think of the event
overall what's your actual opinion your
actual opinion and and then I will
proceed the phone calls
ok I'm naturally internet this is hey
you know what this is Intel who let's
admit it
they've been asleep of the throttle for
a few years now the lumbering giant
looks like it's waking up finally and
there's a lot of goodness here a lot of
really future looking stuff I think
there's a really good chance that
Intel's gonna get back into this game so
yeah be ready for the day when they may
actually have a good part and you may
actually have to admit it's faster it
may be cheaper I don't know what you can
do about it you know but yeah that's
it's a good it's a it's finally the ship
is turned a little bit that's good news
right for everybody right consumers what
about what do you think about the the
stacking approach oh yeah so this the
stack meeting is cool because they're
you know you can stack what 10 Anna
meter and 20 22 nanometers so that's
really cool because they're gonna build
chips out of very different things so
they can certain things that not might
need to be on 22 nanometer or 40
nanometer can be that way and then so
they can just sort of Lego the whole
thing together
and if they can really hit their claims
of getting the performance of what
they're getting another model of the
course as good news if I'm the internet
I would say well then you're just it's
all glued together it's not a one chip
right that's or you would say well but
you're copying right your put your
coffee and the other guys right so I
would definitely say yes that would be
that would be the internet argument I'm
right now I'm gonna go in and type well
there's somebody else did this already
you're just simply copying with chip
let's all right yeah I'll point out
though that it is it doesn't seem like a
natural direction for Silicon to go
towards multiple pieces of silicon is
just too expensive to model I think it's
getting too difficult and even Nvidia
has a big white paper out there on MCM
on multi chip modules so I don't know it
definitely seems like the future doesn't
it but I think the big difference will
be you know can is when's this gonna
come out I mean seriously tend the
problem with Intel right now even though
they've done this they've shared more
information that we've had Intel share
in years but if they can't deliver
people are very skeptical now if Intel's
ability to deliver next generation
silicon and I mean looks good yeah is
there plenty of reason to be skeptical
yeah like I'd be skeptical until you see
it right but at the same time the
internet needs to be like damn they've
actually delivered and damn they're
hitting their power thermals performance
and price then you got to give it to
them you can't just kind of retreat back
into your cubbyhole and say oh well you
know moving target how are you yeah yeah
so yeah let's we gotta be fair to them
so I think it looks good but I mean I
think if people skeptical it's fair so
right how about you Steve how of me what
what is the question what do I think do
you think you know let's turn this round
Gordon you're the new host guys Steve
from gamers Nexus here so let me ask you
Gordon do you think this is enough to
convince everybody that Intel's back is
until bad I feel like it's a trick
question like it's a trick question
Steve I think you're trying to trying to
corner me on this one it's Intel back I
think the question I will ask you is did
Intel go anywhere
sure sure they went somewhere because
their price expensive you couldn't get
the parts you know all those kind of
negatives
they couldn't have they couldnt could be
in a cork count and he's gonna beat them
seven and meaner
there's a lot of really negatives there
I I don't know if this I'm gonna buy
this if I'm the Internet I don't know I
might be skeptical so first first
Internet or Steve whoever you may be
I'll point out that a seven versus ten
isn't quite so simple it's not just a
battle of which number is higher than
they were lower than the other as you as
you pointed out there's a three
difference one is eight nine ten that's
that's a lot of what one's in there but
does it matter I think that will come
down to things like densities here
because it's not just about seven versus
ten it's about density and what else is
going on in the in the architecture but
if the box is seven and the other box
says ten I won seven right sieve
I mean gordan high that's a that's a
that's a tough question Gordon I mean
Steve I don't know if it's it's kind of
like you ever see two frequencies you
can buy a GP with 2000 megahertz or a
GPU with 1600 megahertz are those the
only two specs that matter okay what I
want to know Gordon is if you think that
this sunny Cove is gonna compete with
rise in second generation we need to
know right now
second generation of Zen as in horizon
3000 or whatever maybe confusing names
notwithstanding I'm gonna use some work
it'll compete in naming for sure it's
hard to beat the confusing mists of the
risin name and I will say that oh I
don't know I think Intel's pretty good
at confusing people with their code
names that's true
sunny Cove golden Cove willow Cove
presumably they mean something to
someone I I think to answer your
question from what I've seen now I'm
gonna go out and say yes it will compete
but I don't know specifically where and
I'm gonna go out and say that the IGP is
it may potentially have the ability to
start competing with the AP use but we
what we don't know is what's the thermal
envelope puts the power envelope how big
does it have to be to fit that higher
power IGP on there but strictly based on
performance it looks pretty competitive
with a/b is so here's other question
though so we know that I've read all the
rumors I've seen the numbers ii risin
risin to 3000 series gonna have a lot of
cores it's gonna come out they're gonna
announce it at CES is what the rumors
say if this sunny coke doesn't come out
in 2019 on desktops what do you do do
you just it doesn't come out on 2019 in
2019 that's that might be too little too
late it's 2020 I don't know you start
losing some of the steam right some of
the marketing hype so I think it's I
think it's gonna gonna happen 2019 but I
don't know I could be wrong okay so it's
got to happen 2019 for to have to be
real right I mean I think right that's
that's how products work if it doesn't
if it doesn't come out when I want it to
come out it's not a real product okay so
do they have to compete on core count
because the crazy rumors that we saw
from ad or TV the specs 16 cores and a
small socket AMD that's a lot of course
for probably not that much money does
Intel have to compete on cores of them I
will say I didn't see I didn't read
those rumors or watch them but I am
lying he's lying
we all saw those specs and rumors I
avoid I am aware of them though so it
doesn't I'll have to compete on core how
I I don't know either way say Anton has
to compete on core count with like the
high end epic or a thread repartee P is
now you could say that anthe has to
compete on frequency and in a lot of
applications frequency is really
important but then you look at something
like blender where MD really for the
price can wipe the floor with Intel with
its threads so do they have to compete I
don't think I don't think Intel has to
compete I think they can continue to
exist without come
but should they compete probably it's
just it's the price right so you don't
would you don't understand it just only
can be one winner for everything
it can't be a product suited for your
needs
it's not about personal computing it's
about the best we just need to know the
best Steve what's your prediction right
now
sunny Cove or rise in 3000 series for
2019 that's a trap it's you won't answer
he will not answer it's you know I'm
gonna I'm gonna do the answer that I
hate getting from people from companies
will just say it depends it depends on
your use case depends on what you want
and Terry I mean if you want to
overclock
I also go ahead and predict that there's
probably gonna be more Headroom there
for Intel on overclocking just based on
the current market so yeah I am these
stretching every bit of out of there CPS
that they can make server clogging kind
of boring if you're not doing anything
exotic so Intel might still hold the
place there and we did give Intel an
award for the the most fun to overclock
this year but AMD like Rison 720 700 is
extremely competitive and things like
hobbyist production if you're doing
blender 3d animation and 3d rendering
workloads I mean yeah but that could
change we could see a whole new world if
we see rise in seven 3000 come out at
CES and we do see sunny Cove next year
next year like all bets are off we don't
know what we're gonna see right yeah I
think next year is going to be if
everything happens to schedule that we
understand presently I think next year
will be a major year for CPUs now you're
looking at Intel's making some pretty
massive moves that deviate from its
current was designed a great deal
especially with join for things like
stacking and fava roasts whatever they
called that approach you know it's it's
a it's a significant change it should
make it more exciting to look at but
yeah we don't we have no idea what
that's gonna be for performance because
it could fall apart for all we know it
could be the best we've ever seen so if
I want to go on a forum and I want to
post something really negative
but Intel how am I gonna do that you
need to give me some advice well how do
I we've already heard we already heard
Steve's advice we want to hear your
advice Gordon Gordon's advice
what Gordon's advice be think Gordon's
advice first first he would get their
hands going cuz you gotta get the Gordon
hands going right Gordon hands going so
I think I think I as Gordon would say
but but it's too late but but AMD but
it's too late Gordon its timing Steve
it's too late they miss the boat
no one cares anymore I think that is
what the the mean counter would truly
find fuel to post there mean comment
that is where they would find it to be
the first is all that matters once you
get to that clearly I mean look at the
cons below this video there's probably
like five down there right now that's a
first
that's true so if you posted firsts
congratulations you won the Internet and
thank you for joining me Steve oh thank
you
Gordon for doing this interview
opportunity with gamers Nexus why are
you holding the mic has to be holding a
mic but anyway this is a channel gamers
Nexus will be signing out now back to
you Dave that's that's not actually what
I say</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
