Nexus dotnet and today we're looking at
NZXT is phantoms 630 enthusiast
McMansion gaming case I've done three
case reviews recently so this will be
the last in the line before we hit some
new liquid coolers and more gaming
content the phantom 630 is a sort of
successor to the 820 we reviewed
recently but it attempts to fill the I
don't have $250 burning a hole in my
pocket market which and this is news to
me quite a few of you peons are a part
of first and foremost I will say that
the 630 is priced at 180 dollars
hence my attribution of the McMansion
category but ships with nearly identical
cooling features although slightly
modified cable management options and
fewer shiny lights than the phantom 820
which is the the 250 dollar one as
always let's hit the hard specs and an
overview of functionality prior to
getting into my opinions and the
objective thermal data structurally
speaking NZXT phantom 630 isn't too
different from the 820 it's slightly
shorter and about 10 millimetres fatter
making for easier cable management but
the underlying frame is the same sturdy
scaffolding we're familiar with from
NZXT and the outer shell isn't all that
different either the 630 ships with for
fans presently three of which are 200
millimetres in the the front top and
side top beam exhaust and one 140
millimeter in the rear also exhaust
creating a somewhat standard airflow
pathway and there are optional expansion
slots for another 200 millimeter fan in
the top a 120 or 140 millimeter internal
pivotal fan and up to to bottom 140 or
120 millimeter fans we had some fun in
numerating a fan configurations with the
case so if you're interested in
determining what the actual difference
an extra fan or two will make stick
around for the latter half of the video
and I will show you some charts the case
will accommodate four external drives of
up to eight internal 3.5 or 2.5 drives
and two of those eight our SSD only
cages that are concealed behind the
motherboard it also hosts nine expansion
slots the case
chips in white matte black and gunmetal
and the one you're looking at is
gunmetal so the same with our 820 it was
gunmetal it's outfitted with a
split-level motherboard mounting panel
and that is it's kind of interesting it
allows cable routing through the
horizontal plane rather than the
vertical plane and this is particularly
useful when dealing with the EPS the
12-volt cable and the fan cables other
than that the the case can fit a CPU
cooler of up to 170 millimeters in
height and the that's with the side fan
in place and if you remove the side fan
that ships with it it's 200 millimeters
in height max for the CPU cooler and
video cards of up to 325 millimeters
will fit or if you remove the hard drive
cages you can fit them up to 500 and 7
millimeters
speaking of that the hard drive bays are
completely modular meaning you can
remove some of them or all of them which
opens up space for a custom cooling loop
or more breathable front intake the hard
drive bays are fitted with the same
flimsy cages that are shipped with the
820 but no real love lost there the case
in total weighs around 27 pounds so it's
only a few pounds lighter than the 820
and is mostly the same size I mean at
the end of the day it's 10 millimeters
wider I believe and slightly shorter so
once again very similar to the 820 there
is however no mini hue on this one so
the lighting options are completely
absent other than a rear i/o panel light
which is pretty nice very bright but
still nice so I suppose that contributes
a lot to the cost cutting because you're
losing out on that hue option but if you
really care you can buy your own custom
lighting system for cheaper anyway than
the $70 difference between the two cases
overall the case was the strap described
to us by NZXT reps as what they called
the perfect case for those who couldn't
quite stretch for the 820 but really
liked it and let's figure out if it is
in fact the perfect case for those who
can't stretch for the 820 so throughout
the build process I was taken aback by
how even more so than its predecessor
how these 630 is one of the easiest
cases
to build with on the market there are
others that are great in this price
range don't get me wrong but the 630
just really steps ahead and offers a
couple new features that are very cool
like the ones I've mentioned and the
cable management options first of all
are an apple and positioned perfectly
for the ATX boards and most VGA s-video
graphics adapters of course and the
split-level motherboard it just makes it
that much easier to conceal the cables
the dark side of the board features
easily exploited cable routing contours
and cable tie anchor points so while
still managing to cram two hidden SSD
compartments and all the other rear
facing features the the case very easily
accommodates all of those cables it's
there's just a ton of room even for
three or four PCIe cables a fully
modular drive bay system also allows for
very customizable liquid loops and other
airflow pathways depending on how
extreme you want to get but the case
will still mount you our standard three
by 120 millimeter and two by 120
millimeter CLC radiators and whatever
normal mostly other radiators you have
that are listed in the specs linked
below so check the respects if you're
going to buy the case that way you know
if your radiator will fit the interior
is still plenty big despite having ever
so slightly shorter stature than the 820
NZXT result several of my complaints
from their 820 including the SD card
readers inadequate clearance from the
hinged front panel previously if you saw
the the 820 review previously the front
door
would not close with an SD card inserted
it was just terrible because if you hit
that door with your knee or something
and you risk potentially damaging the
card so it just it was really
disconcerting to leave it in there but
now it does so cleanly and the card fits
so that was fixed they also replaced the
plastic key coolest X external clamps
excuse me with more rugged metal clamps
which seemed infinitely more sturdy and
reliable than the previous option
further we were told by an NZXT rep at
CES that they have changed their
painting process for cases and all those
specifics weren't given I'm hoping that
it resolves the lack of resilience in
the 820 s exterior and the paint
previously it sort of scratched very
easily just from moving it from floor to
table which is not normal in our other
cases we test overall it looks like the
company is extremely receptive to
consumer media and media feedback which
is more encouraging than anything else
really and they've taken advice from
previous cases and added it to the 630
so hopefully they'll do so again in the
future and with that let's talk about
cooling and performance the top of this
case features a three step fan
controller that effectively offers low
medium and high settings for obvious
noise and performance advantages were
desired before I tested this against
other cases I tested it against itself
using each of these settings and in
addition did a further test - to check
aftermarket cooling solutions to see
which see if it was actually worth
investing in more fans all the testing
methodology is defined in the article
linked below just to quickly note though
the aftermarket editions we made were
pretty simple I added an extra 200
millimeter NZXT fan li's same one in the
case to the second top exhaust position
and an internal 120 millimeter
silverstone AP 123 fan to the drives
cages angled upward toward both the VGA
and CPU cooler so here's the chart the
deltas are pretty uniform here but for
the aftermarket bar they're sort of
unimpressive really this has always been
the situation with NZXT cases something
about the way the airflow channels work
it just really does not improve because
at the end of the day it's already I
think the channels are sort of already
saturated unless you're using a very
large GP video card which I will talk
about more in a moment
adding a bottom fans of the h18 did
result result in a noticeable difference
in GPU thermal dissipation it was I
believe seven Celsius I think and the
same I suspect would be true with the
630 though I did not test it due to
complications explained in the article
if you do add an extra fan if you were
to add another fan it should be in the
bottom position to cool your video card
because you're not going to get any
noticeable difference in the CPU we're
talking like two to three degrees max I
personally do not see the value in
spending you know 15 20 bucks on another
200 millimeter fan just for that
so no immediate gain
let's look at the cross comparison
between other cases this is the CPU
cooling spread on all of our cases the
Nexus 4 the GPU the phantom 630 on high
settings hovers at around fifty six
point seven Celsius under load after
accounting for ambient 21 C ambient
where the 820 is 56 C with and easily
within our 5% margin of error so no huge
difference there this validates my
expectations that the two would perform
almost identically above the 630
everything above it is pretty much every
I mean really just every other case on
the bench
other than the low-end Cobra we tested
but the larger fancier cases will often
be embellished with lots of plastic
grills dust filters sound dampeners and
larger fans so don't be too surprised by
that that means that just because you're
spending more doesn't mean you get
better cooling it means that you get
better other features like a quieter
case the pea 630 is quiet and cools
efficiently whereas something like the
armored Evo is fairly noisy but
unbeatable in terms of thermal spec
here's the GPU chart once again the
differences are largely insignificant I
will make the standard disclaimer that
we moved from our old GTX 580 to smaller
cards for the new test bench and in part
to simulate mid-range configurations and
in part because modern cards are cooler
and smaller that said we found that the
deltas between GPU thermals on large and
small cases are significantly more
noticeable with large cards what does
this mean well if you're running a GTX
680 for example you're going to see more
immediate advantages to using the larger
cases than then with a 70 850 so pretty
impossible to have a universal test
bench but we do our best with all of
this known watch the end of the day
message the phantom 630 is quite simply
a resilient solid and trustworthy case
it's a pleasure to build in and as with
its predecessors somehow makes cable
management Wow I can't say those words
today cable management surprisingly fun
the case doesn't have any major quality
flaws to speak of and the performance is
about what you'd expect with that noted
the phantom 630 is here now and ready
for building so given its reliability
acceptable performance and great ease of
installation features uncomfort
recommending it to enthusiast builders
if you are looking for other options in
the price range I will once again
reference Corsair 650d 600 T cases
Silverstone's impending FTO for thermal
takes Revo though to be honest I'm not a
huge fan of that one and if you'd like
something cheaper there's currently a
fantastic deal on Rosewell store version
2 on Newegg it's a $30 off promo code on
for a couple days I think drops it to
$90 very good deal and I'd also just
suggest the P to 80 by antec and cooler
master storm series of cases

it for this video review check out the

you have any questions I'll see you all
