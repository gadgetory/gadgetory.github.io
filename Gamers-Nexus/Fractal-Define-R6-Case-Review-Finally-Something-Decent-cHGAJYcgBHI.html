case launches they've had the define C
the defined mini C case and they also
had the Mushaf I see all three of these
enclosures fall into the category of not
garbage which is pretty rare for cases
in the last year so today they're
launching the define r6 which we are
reviewing and hopefully it also falls
into the not garbage category of cases
before getting to those that this
coverage is brought to you by EB GA and
their 1080 T is c2 which we've
recommended fairly highly for its build
quality and the icx sensors which are
kind of fun to play with you can check
our full sc2 review for the 1080i if
you're curious to learn more or you can
click the link in the description below
to find the product page for the 1080i
sc2 so this is the define r6 following
up the define r5 which was a really
popular case and just again the mesh if
I see came out not too long ago we
actually liked that case a good bit the
define C had a high build quality good
kale management features all that stuff
it's a little on the warm side and not a
lot of room to improve compared to the
massif IC but there's two options there
that were both pretty good build quality
also a rarity lately this is the r6 this
one comes in a bit more expensive at
$150 so it's quite a bit more than it's
about two times the measure of IC and
it's got a couple of more flagship type
features to it so to walk you through
the basics the define r6 has all of the
marketing check box elements except for
RGB LEDs will all mourn the loss I guess
but other than that it does have
tempered glass it does have vertical GPU
support which we've been pretty you know
how we feel about that I think over the
last few months power supply shroud all
that stuff semi modular design couple
cool new features though the side panel
actually mounts in a way that is not old
or idiotic and it's mounting there's
been a lot of that this year as well so
it just pops out like that like it just
pulls and there's a release and that's
all there is to it and closed back in so
I actually really like that
it's a small feature but at this point
the smallest of the accounts with cases
especially when the $150 so job well
done fractal for making a side panel
that actually has a good removal
mechanism something that like feels like
it makes sense when you're using it they
have a button in the back that is kind
of reminiscent of what NZXT just did now
they're not copying each other these
cases take a while to develop NZXT
probably launched there as I'm sure
fractal was like uh we've been working
on that same thing for like the last six
months so they're not copying each other
I don't think but they do have a button
on the back like NZXT NZXT is pops off
the left side panel fractals button pops
up the top side the top panel now you'll
notice when I pushed it you probably
didn't really see anything happening on
camera that's because to actually remove
it you still have to get up in there
from inside the case so it's a nice idea
but it doesn't have the same tactile
feel that NZXT is does where you can
push it and a hole shoots off the side
like a rocket so yeah it's not not the
best implementation really not that much
different than just not having the
button and pushing it up with some clips
so that could use work but it was a cool
idea and we're happy to see fragile at
least trying stuff that's mechanical and
different and not poorly executed to a
point of being hugely detrimental I mean
if that's your main complaint about the
case that you push a button and there's
no spring tension release or anything
like that if that's the main complaint
you're in pretty good shape so not a big
deal
but it's definitely something they can
improve on other core features of the
case other than the mechanical stuff I
use this bit more mechanical you can
pull out this shroud on the front half
of the case it's basically a hard drive
shroud you can pull that out you pull
all the drive cages out and you can just
leave it basically open air similar to
something like well most of the cases
right now really where they have their
drives hidden in the bottom front under
the shroud and then the rest is all open
you could do more liquid cooling that
way bigger radiator support in terms of
thickness all that kind of stuff we did
test it for airflow with all the cages
removed
versus stock which is how I have it set
up right now and you'll see those
thermal numbers in a bit but other than
that they've done a good job with the
EPS 12 volt hole placement that's
something like some cases I've
overlooked this year as well so they
have them in two key locations which
will cover pretty much every board
they've also got sort of standard rubber
grommets things like that stuff that's
not too important or innovative overall
but the big thing here is something you
can't really see as much as you can feel
which is the build quality is actually
good the panel thickness comes together
in a way that there's some rigidity to
the case it doesn't feel like it's
flimsy and falling apart and the
construction quality is good the airflow
paths are okay as you'll see in the
thermals they're just kind of okay which
for a case that's marketed as more
silent focused and acoustics focused is
actually good I mean if you kind of
weight the scale and your focus is on
either airflow or noise you can't do
both then if you're doing okay average
and the one that you're not focusing on
that's really about where you want to be
you can't really be good at both noise
suppression and the high airflow doesn't
really work that way generally speaking
so they're okay they're kind of okay
with air flow the reason they're in a
decent spot with air flow relative to
their marketing which is noise focused
is because there's about maybe an inch
3/4 of an inch
side and take on the front and it is on
both sides
unlike other cases this year not sure
why that's so hard and they have two
fans pre-installed in the front they
also have one fan pre-installed and back
there's not much point and buy an extra
fans here it comes with pretty much
every slot populated that you could
populate
short of going closed loop route and
just putting better fans on it for the
sake of better fans so they actually do
populate all the slots it does matter it
does help and the ventilation is good
enough that in a noise focused case
you'll be fine
but I mean again not going to lead any
charge because ultimately that front is
still solid
there's no match there it's not gonna
lead and thermals while having that
front on it
but that's not the goal and the reason I
bring this up is because you look at
something like the H 500 P where we have
marketing materials from Coolermaster
saying guaranteed high air volume case
or you look at something like the
BitFenix and so which had marketing
material that talks about these hidden
ventilation ports on the front panel
which is like hidden in the sense of an
invisibility cloak you can't see them
because they don't exist those marketing
materials are objectively misleading or
false so we knock them for that in
fractals case they're not really
marketing high airflow at least and the
review guide the materials we've
received the marketing noise suppression
so that's we're gonna be looking at most
now to that end you pop off the other
panels and they've got this sort of it's
it's the usual foam it's maybe a
millimeter a half a millimeter thick
it's got kind of a canvas finish on it
theoretically this will primarily help
with things like oil wine high-pitched
noises stuff where you've got a really
short wave small wave form that just
hits all the divots on the side and
breaks apart and so hopefully that kind
of stops most the higher pitched higher
frequency noises from reaching you or it
mitigates them the only way to stop
lower frequency noises is thick cowling
something like five millimeter aluminum
stuff like that which is unreasonable
for most cases so yeah they're targeting
a suppression of the annoying wine
noises which is kind of what you want to
do and let the metal handle the rest the
low words and things like that so yeah
let's get into the testing we have a
full written review of this as always
that is written by Patrick Lathan who
worked on the case primarily he has a
couple of other opinions that are worth
reading linked in the article below I'm
going to focus on the thermals and the
noise for you and we'll get to the
conclusion so as always our testing
methodology will be detailed in the
article linked in the description below
we are primarily referencing temperature
as delta T over ambient so it is DT over
ambient meaning
moving ambient from the measurement and
for extra tests we removed the front
panel not just the door but the entire
front panel which is something we're
doing standard now we mounted the GPU
vertically we open the top Maji event as
fractal calls it and we reconfigured to
the open layout removing the hard drive
cages and the shroud in the front as
usual we're starting with only the
temperatures to the define r6 and it's
different configurations then we'll look
at comparative data with other cases
average CPU temperature during the
torture test was 56 degrees Celsius
but dropped to 45 point four degrees
with the whole front panel removed this
is a newly standardized test for us and
helps determine how much Headroom a case
has to thermally improve its design
we'll have to look at the resulting
noise levels later though to see what
kind of acoustic impact there is by
removing the front panel because it's
obviously not a realistic scenario this
temperature drop is to be expected with
all the noise damping and baffles in the
way of the airflow opening the top had a
much less dramatic but still significant
impact on lowered CPU temperatures which
is enough fact we've seen before
vertical GPU mounting gets the radiative
heat from the backplate away from the
CPU cooler further aiding and lower in
CPU temperatures but we'll have to see
what it does for the GPU in a moment as
for fractals open layout where in the
drive cages are removed and the side
trout is relocated the layout had no
real effect on CPU temperature so for
our configuration with air cooling we're
just not really seeing a change you
might as well leave them in there there
are certain situations where you want to
remove them though primarily with custom
water loops and things of that nature
fractals define our six next appears in
our comparative CPU benchmarks 56° is
around where the NZXT s340 elites
Coolermaster h 500 PE and stock define
SI scored middle of the chart
temperatures that aren't really
impressive by themselves but are made
impressive primarily and only by the RO
sixes emphasis on silence this becomes a
question of marketing when the product
like the BitFenix ends over the H 500 P
claims to offer high airflow and low
temperatures it needs to actually do so
define R 6 in the marketing materials we
received never claimed outright top
formants and thermals it's a silence
focused case and so we'll look at those
in a moment if the case can deliver
lower than average noise levels while
maintaining average - slightly below
average temperatures it'll be in an okay
position and then it's up to the user to
make a decision whether that makes sense
for their build or not the stock mesh if
I see and then be quiet more expensive
dark bass 700 were slightly cooler than
this but the competing dark bass pro 900
and pure bass 600 in terms of thermal
and acoustic performance were both
warmer opening the top cover though
pushed the r6 up quite a few spots
better than anything that defined see
achieved with the front panel on stock
bands and slightly better than the
Corsair 270 are removing the front panel
expectedly demonstrates that the r6
could run way cooler with an open face
but we'll see if the enclosure makes up
for this in acoustic performance is
again ultimately the marketing objective
average GPU temperature was 50 6.4
degrees in the stock torture test which
only dropped about 3 degrees when the
front panel was removed not much room
for improvement when looking at just the
define r6 is numbers here neither
opening the top cover nor the open
layout had a significant impact on GPU
temperature this makes sense as neither
is particularly beneficial to the
airflow path for the GPU specifically
anyway the vertical GPU mount caused a
huge temperature increase as usual -
seventy two point seven degrees Celsius
delta T over ambient with a definite
decrease in frequency as the GPU diode
hit 93 degrees in its actual temperature
we have a frequency overtime plot for
that so we are dropping clocks pretty
hard here as the hard throttle wall for
NVIDIA Pascal architecture is about 84
degrees Celsius and at 82 we start
dropping clocks at 60 you start dropping
clocks and so on so this is actually
driving pretty hard since Fraxel sent us
the proper PCIe riser cable we didn't
have to strap everything together with
zip ties and the GPU and CPU coolers
didn't even make contact like they had
been in some other cases so this is just
how it is with air cooled components in
this configuration as we've been saying
for six months now vertical GPU mounts
for open face cards just don't really
make sense they perform awfully and
you'd ideally use the
for an open-loop configuration as the
liquid makes up for any radiative or
airflow disadvantages
since the GPU is much more aggressive
about altering clock speed to lower
temperature the differences between
cases are smaller on our GPU comparison
chart fifty six point four degrees
Celsius delta T over ambient is just 0.2
degrees warmer than the metruff I see
and defined C with the extra Noctua
intake bands and so we can call these
functionally the same it's still on the
warm side for what we consider decent
both the be quiet dark base 702 and dark
base pro 900 have lower GPU temperatures
and the cheaper pure base 600 is roughly
equivalent we mentioned these because
they are noise focused a lot of this
comes down to that shroud
although the enclosure gets decent air
flow into it roughly on par with the
case that as to 200 millimeter fans in
the front no less the shroud is still
trapping some of the heat from the open
face card
despite that ventilation port in the top
of the shroud there is not much that can
be done about it
aside from focus any more air flow
toward the bottom of the chassis while
looping 3dmark fire striking extreme
test average GPU temperature was fifty
nine point five degrees over ambient
about on par with the BitFenix and so
and corsair spec o for this is a little
bit embarrassing for a $150 case we
define our six as its scoring alongside
one of the worst cases we've reviewed
lately the dark bass 700 was
significantly cooler at fifty four point
six degrees Celsius but both the stock
matchup IC and define c were warmer
thanks to their limited stock fans this
could be improved again by adding fans
as you would expect and you can see our
reviews for each of those to see how we
added fans and what they did rendering
our blended test on the cpu average CPU
delta T over ambient was thirty six
point nine degrees that's cooler than
any case we've run that test on except
for these Silverstone RL zero six
including the dark bass pro 900 and dark
bass 700 the our six is definitely
capable of keeping an air-cooled CPU at
safe temperatures under this kind of
load however rendering on the GPU
average GPU delta T over ambient was
twenty-nine point two degrees relative
to other cases it fared better than it
did in fire strike but still not enough
to compete with the to be quiet cases
the r6 did cool better than the massif I
see and define see and a beat the Enzo
by three degrees this teaches us
something important the r6 primarily
starts struggling with GPU and CPU
thermals when both are under load it
doesn't have enough pathways for hot air
to escape the enclosure which is
something that we don't always see pop
up as an issue because some of these
cases are more capable of exhausting the
heat than others an open phase card will
always require some form of escape for
all that air that's being shot into the
case in the stock configuration for
noise levels with the fans at max speed
the r6 reached 33.8 DBA all the baffles
and padding as you can see here really
do something they actually worked in
fractals marketing delivers with the top
cover opened noise levels increased
measurably but not necessarily audibly
to 34.9 DBA and with the front panel
removed completely it jumped to thirty
nine point seven DBA 33.8 decibels is
almost exactly the same as the pure bass
600 and the only case that's quieter at
max rpm is the Thermaltake core p3
because it has no fans so the case in
terms of build quality is actually very
good it's well done it has a good
structural feel to it you can't really
flex it like you can with a lot of cases
and although you're not gonna sit there
and try and flex your case or bow it or
anything like that the point is that
it's actually built with quality
materials and it doesn't feel like cheap
crap that you're gonna throw away in
here so they've done well there and this
is something fractal is done well with
the defined C and to some extent the
metruff IC as well so that hasn't
changed that we still would praise
fractal for their build quality and
tooling of this case the noise levels
are also pretty good they've done well
with isolating noise that can be
annoying with these foam pads they
actually do work as we've seen now one
thing we don't show is frequency
spectrum analysis that would show you if
we had the configuration the test setup
for it would show you that yes lower
frequency noises are still going to be
heard at about the same level as on
pretty much every case except for five
millimeter thick
but the higher frequency noises like
coil wine are dealt with pretty handily
by this material on the side panels and
the top panel so fractals done well
there and that fits their marketing
where they fall behind a bit is still
thermals this is acceptable to some
extent because they're not saying that
they're a high airflow case they don't
guarantee high air volume they don't say
they have hidden vents in the panel's
they're saying they're good at noise
suppression and they are so it's okay to
be a bit behind in thermals if you're
not marketing them as a leading selling
point fractal ends up about middle of
the chart for some of the thermal tests
they're pretty bad and others vertical
mounted to open-face GPU we absolutely
don't recommend and we also didn't
recommend it for the Vue 71 or any other
case that had that option you can do
open-loop if you wanted to use it the
CPU and GPU both being under intensive
load is pretty hard on the case it has
trouble getting rid of the heat once it
collects it because you've really got no
good escape for the all of that
dissipating energy from the GPU down
here so what's it do it's gonna radiate
up off the backplate the fans will
disperse it throughout the case you've
got this glass insulation on the side
and the only way really to get it out is
eventually to get sucked through the CPU
cooler if it's an air cooler like a
tower cooler and then pushed out the
back of the case that increases your CPU
temperatures a bit as well and the GPU
has its own problems with the CPU cooler
at our cooler radiating heat off of it
hitting the backplate so it does
struggle a bit when both are under heavy
load however it still functions it's not
really throttling only starts dropping
clocks hard when your side mounted with
a vertical GPU not the worst thing in
the world so yeah overall fractal has a
case that is average to slightly below
average in thermal performance however
if you weighed it relative to its
marketing which is what we do it's doing
decently for thermals compared to its
noise performance it's acoustic
performance and the build quality pretty
much makes up for everywhere that
fractal falls short thermally so they've
definitely got some stuff they can
improve on that's what you want in any
product but it's something we could
recommend at its price point which the
last like four cases reviewed I couldn't
say that for so this is refreshing and
it's nice to have a case that doesn't
suck and is actually good build quality
as far as their animals if you really
care about that kind of thing you could
buy better fans it's $150 you probably
have some money anyway
so you can improve it a bit if you had
to or you pop up the top then you
increase your noise levels by 1.5 DBA
and you decrease the temperature
significantly so those are options as
always if you want to read more about
