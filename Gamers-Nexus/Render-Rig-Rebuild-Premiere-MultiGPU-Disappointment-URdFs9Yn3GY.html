or the Adobe Media encoder says it will
take to render our video that just went
live the cpu stream video so this is
just another render pass of it to see
how long it took we're sitting here
looking at a one hour 13 minute mark and
that's not really improving so this has
been a problem for us upgrading the
cameras did a lot of things for us one
the cameras got way better ergonomics we
can make better use of it get a better
b-roll shots to it is technically better
in the technological sense it is
superior in every way more mobile better
than low-light all those things
unfortunately rendering the footage
takes a lot longer because it's 4k and
it's a higher bitrate we're doing 50 53
megabits per second or something like
that now which is 2x from what we were
before the camera capture is that
whatever it is 150 or nearly 200 and
Japan was studying to use so it's an
improvement in everything except render
times at an hour to complete the render
we're looking at days where sometimes if
we push back recording too late because
this is a daily operation we don't in
fact have weeks of content in the pipe
pushing back too late in the day means
we're waiting an hour to render and then
we're waiting probably an hour to upload
and then we're probably waiting an hour
for you to the process it then we're
probably waiting 30 minutes for anything
other than 360p to become available so
it's a problem so we can speed that up
by upgrading this machine a bit and
increasing the rendering speed by going
to a different video card setup because
we do use CUDA so that's what we're
going to do today we're going to upgrade
it we have some benchmarks on rendering
these videos just from log files and
we'll be able to see what the
improvement is there we're also going to
retest some blender animation rendering
on this specific machine not the
production machine we built the other
day so we're going through all that
today while I'm in there I'm going to
replace some fans that are making awful
noises so should be a fun build blog
before that this coverage is brought to
you by the core g21 enclosure from
thermal take a $70 case with 2 4
millimeters thick tempered glass side
panels mesh ventilation in the front for
breathability a rarity in cases these
days and a power supply shroud with top
mounted SSD sled learn more at the link
in the description below ok we got to
carry it in the other room we should
wash that out so we think we updated
this in maybe December we did a video on
it last time - it hasn't been maintained
so the dust is from December oh yeah I
do remember this these stupid screws
hold that thing in pan oh this is that
be quiet power supply so if they're not
already plugged in I have them somewhere
else doesn't look like I anticipated
adding a another video card yeah there's
not this is the only one in there ok
TUC TUC tall the way in the back corner
of a closet back in the this stuff goes
away soon pile where's the box for the
cable so you want one of these I could
undo everything and do it the right way
and take the power supply out of there
or I can fight with it until it does
what I want which I guess is what I'm
gonna do okay this needs to be yes okay
cool
it's good all right sweet not as bad as
I thought okay so I kept us another
cable doesn't Oh correction other two
Gables
okay 120 oh wait this is going to suck
yeah place the front line oh yeah in the
middle the middle ones disconnected
because it was causing the same problem
of the front ones closet now so the 360
is only had two fans operating which is
fine it was still plenty cool but it
could be better
these are those enter max anti dust fans
they spin backwards when you turn them
on they're supposed to expel dust from
the system which is a cool idea
unfortunately two out of three fans have
not caused problems the same on for each
one
and that is they make this grinding
noise that's really annoying just kind
of throughout operation the middle one I
disconnected because it's making the
same problem the front one I was like
I'm not going to just connect two out of
three fans we're just going to stop it
and start it a choice goes away but a
better solution get rid of it well we're
in here anyway there's not only can he
dusted it or anything
how's the radiator work readers doing
pretty well
all these dust filters are doing their
job so that's what you want you want to
see no dust in the radiators which
really not much in that one either so
good job Silverstone this is a
Silverstone case it has a dust filter in
the bottom has a giant dust filter in
the front where all the intake is not
that it's relevant there's dust filter
on the top as well so good job on the
case is a PMO watt if anyone cares I'm
certainly happy to recommend it see no
dust after seven months of use all the
dust is exterior and we've cleaned the
outside a couple times but haven't done
anything serious so great news there
okay
don't also look pretty good I mean the
fans look fine there's really not much
doubt that they can you see that like I
mean the dust is really not not there
how much of that is well there's and say
how much of that is attributable to the
fan I think that's probably minimal I
think what we're seeing is the effect of
the Silverstone case but I don't relat
ate it anyway okay so we need new fans
can we get that one out I think we're
gonna leave that want to leave that one
in there as a reminder of the mistake to
use these fan you can so these are 120 s
what do I have for 120 and they exceed
do we have other NTSC pens
oh I do have n DXE pants hang on I
forgot about these this sent
these with all their toxic I'm not going
to use the RGB you on the RGB LEDs will
never be seen did you only send RGB fans
okay now he's in ours
there's one for T's I think there's a
122 pack Oh a 2-pack 120 ok we're in
business
hopefully I don't need to actually test
phantom time soon I say as we're
ordering knock to offend us the funds we
want this how do we install the fan ok
alright so step 1 this is remove the
trim then how many instructions on how
to install a fan ok well thanks everyone
for watching that's it for this time not
sure what to do next so
testing fans is difficult for a lot of
reasons pressure testing all that stuff
all requires anemometers or wind tunnels
or all kinds of special equipment to
really do it properly and do it justice
so hence we don't really do a lot of
stuff with fans but this content with
whatever they're called Noctua should be
pretty interesting I think we do have
knocked with stuff coming in for sure
the magnetic oh that is magnetic okay
excellent not much point in managing
these cables but whatever
let me grab this just get the rest of
the dust just a lot of dust to get off
okay but seriously on dat that from the
bottom of my heart thank you for the
dust rag and thank you for the patience
on the fans they are now being put to
use okay what does even collegeplus say
what they call air
f 120s that's what we're using their
airflow fans in case you were confused
and thought that they were the type of
fan that doesn't cause airflow there's
no sleep really quiet and I hope I hope
NZXT I hope and I am fairly positive
that we won't have another one of these
we're just starts making all kinds of
weird grinding noises and causes me to
reach up there and just hold the fan
until it slowly goes to sleep and stops
making noises okay are we actually going
to do videocard need a video card from
the video card shelf okay these were
hidden in the background of one of our
videos recently no one cared um we're
going back to 1080i shelf and I'm going
to grab this time the gigabyte 1080
TI which is my least favorite of the
ones that we've reviewed and we're not
going to work with it again because it's
my least favorite just I'll explain in
the other room so this card this is
going that was least impressive to me
it's the biggest we have 1080i is that a
representative of 1080 T is for future
game benchmarks we have enough to do SLI
testing if we want to not for project so
I have one to spare for a build
especially one that's going to be used
at work every day for rendering videos
and it's still a 1080 TI so it'll still
render videos just fine but I just don't
find it particularly exciting to revisit
I don't think we'll ever revisit it I
think we're far more likely to revisit
something like the Asus card which was
really impressive for the noise and
cooling performance or maybe hybrid
cards or maybe the gaming x4 being a
dual fan cooler that competes with the
three fan cooler those there are lots of
reasons to revisit and bar benchmark
again and again and run game tests going
forward into the future as new games
come out but we don't need all of them
to do that some of them can be used for
rendering tasks and production machines
like this one and this one is just
really not I mean to me it just looking
at all the other ones we've now reviewed
since this came out this is really not
an exciting card to me so I like to use
these types of devices our least
favorite ones for our work machines
because they are the least important for
the actual work that is produced on a
daily basis but they can still produce
work that if you follow me there this is
awful look at this thing
talk about sag cheese oh by the way this
has 980ti for those of you who missed it
this is actually a Titan X Maxwell I
forgot Titan X Maxwell I put that hybrid
cooler on it because it's better okay
alright Titan x times got a new buddy
Steve reviewers calling the Titan X card
from 2015 are doing a disservice by
calling it Titan XM you're adding
confusion because when I talk about
Titan X I'm not talking out the Titan X
I'm talking about the Titan X so that's
AG maybe we should start doing psych
testing holy crap I mean the good news
is that'll make it to that the Maxwell
card can breeze which would be around 10
there it is that's where it really is so
we should be that there whatever please
go up here you might be saying to
yourself see why bother with the cables
at this point you didn't hide the fan
cables and to that I would say you have
a good point
do any nestled I've read to be on a nice
lie bridge for premiere right I don't
think so
doesn't care about us a lie okay might
as well put these in otherwise I'll lose
huh hey hi
they plug everything in yes this front
glass filter we really should just clean
this is what a company that's paranoid
of you taking up the case by your front
panel and dropping it does I put screws
in the front panel because they think
their users are going to hurt themselves
or their components which is probably
true 80% of the time see what I say by
true eighty percent of the time and
thanks to being liquid cold everything
is still breathing okay by breathing I
mean it's coin okay it's plan out
breathing okay but it is coin
and none of this got sucked into the
radiators which I'm very happy about
rage for the cleaning radiators really
sucks
snowflakes Nippon
okay that's not helping with my dust
problem there are cut hairs on my hands
now you're going to get back into the
case okay
side panels they better turn back on so
I thought okay so long story short after
doing our livestream in the middle of
working on this video if you missed it
by the way we worked on this EK water
setup but anyway we got a system set up
and going I ended up swapping the 1080i
into the top slot to get some extra
performance out of Premiere and our
blender render times have improved by
nearly 2 X so our test render was 1
frame from the new intro animation just
at a lower resolution 40% to 4k and that
rendered at about 12 to 13 minutes with
the Titan XM single card previously and
with a 1080i and the Titan XM in there
it's rendering at about 6 so that's huge
that is a massive upgrade for our
ability to render things locally on that
machine a not have to build a special
machine for it and also to rapidly
prototype animations and renders and
stuff like that so good news there the
less-fortunate news is that premiere as
we found out in research and found some
great articles on Puget systems premier
doesn't really seem to care about
multi-gpu at all like zero does not care
and I knew that was the case years ago
but I was hoping that by now they would
have fixed it and it's not I mean it's
just basically we get a couple percent
fit 1 to 2% faster with a 1080i
over-tighten X M big deal and the second
card is just not really utilized at all
they are accelerators they're not the
renderers and that means that ultimately
your bottleneck is the cpu so what do we
do well to fix it we could do something
like keep the x79 set up keep the
windows installed and swap it to a Xeon
processor from the same era for 200
bucks off of ebay and it would have four
more threads at a two point eight
gigahertz speed rather than four point
four gigahertz before fewer threads
whether that's worth it I'm not sure I
might try it just because it'd be kind
of fun and there's no real harm in
trying it but that would be the next
step short of building a completely new
system which I just don't feel like
doing right now but yeah so premier is
hitting a bottleneck on the CPU with
CUDA rendering that certainly speeds
things up a hell of a lot but not in a
way that takes advantage of multi-gpu
unfortunately and ultimately premier is
pretty poorly optimized as software
anyway as we've come to learn
particularly if you look into solutions
like network rendering which just isn't
going to happen unless you buy a third
party rendering tool apparently so we'll
look into that as well as an option just
if we could export stuff to another
system that'd be great but for now
blender two times faster that's pretty
good fans that don't make a lot of noise
the system is pretty cool overall and
everything's going cleaned up so that's
it for this one as always thanks for
