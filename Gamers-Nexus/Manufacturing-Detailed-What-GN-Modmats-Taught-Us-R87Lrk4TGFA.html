we're gonna go over two main things one
what we've learned from making a real
product and two how that impacts our
review process because it informs us
greatly on what's going on if you're not
familiar with the mod mat and this is
the first time you've seen it the very
basics of it it's that it's a four foot
by two foot modding service you put it
out to protect the table or the surface
underneath it is grounded so we have a
common ground point going to a snap on
the corner of the mat which terminates
in a ring that connects to a ring
terminal where you can ground directly
to a wall or another ground point like a
power supply that you tape on the
outside of the power supply something
like that and then you connect the wrist
strap from the common ground point to
your wrist keeps you grounded which if
you're doing something like just messing
with a motherboard or a video card when
they're assembled there's not a huge
amount of risk for electrostatic
discharge however once you get into
taking the things apart like you're
gonna liquid cool the video card that
was exposed to SMDs are a lot more
susceptible to any kind of damage so
it's one of those things we're working
on like a three thousand dollar Titan V
for example it's worth taking the extra
precaution because not doing it is a
three thousand dollar loss so that's the
whole point it's to protect the stuff
you're working on when you're modding
doing liquid cooling doing shunt
resistor mods stuff like that and also
look pretty cool so we have like a cheat
sheet on here with electrical wiring
where you can see the PCIe eight pin
power headers so if you're trying to do
something like a shunt resistor mod
you're shorting the shunts with the
liquid metal or something
you can take a resistance measurement of
one of the pins on here versus the shunt
resistor foot and check which chunk goes
to which eight pin power header on the
card and this would help you figure out
which pin is which which ones 12 volt
which ones ground and so forth we have a
jump start guide so if you're just
trying to jump the power supply with a
green and a black ground which we point
out for you to make it really easy and
then we have a thermal paste application
guide so again the whole point is to
provide a really nice
service to work on that will protect the
table in the components but also some
useful stuff so we've got like the
thread Ripper recommendations where we
say either just spread it thinly over
the entire surface which is the blue or
if you don't want to do that because
it's kind of a pain with like diamond
compound you do an X with some dots and
it'll spread on its own we've got rising
coffee like sky like X and so forth with
all that basic stuff out of the way
going through some of the case
manufacturing things like that going
through our own we have to oh one second
guys thanks appreciate it ok sorry I had
to deal with some really important
business so just to recap here I'm gonna
go through some of the supply chain
stuff talking about what goes into a
product just because this is stuff I've
learned in the last few weeks so it
might be interesting to you just talk
about cost everything in the process
obviously has a cost and then you also
have to deal with time related to that
cost so to get a sample made that could
take a couple weeks to get it here look
it over if there's anything we want to
change we have to communicate with the
factory they make a new sample ship it
out things like that approve it that
takes time there's also shipping time
alone so obviously when it comes from
the factory and we order a lot of them
to sell retail to all of you we deal
with do we want to put it on a boat or a
plane and here's something interesting
for you the boat takes more than 60 days
to get it all cleared here at this
location shall we so we can ship it out
60 days is too long we didn't want to
wait that long and make people who've
pre-ordered or backordered wait 60 days
just because it's done but we're waiting
for it to travel over the ocean a plane
is about 10 to 12 it's way more
expensive obviously so we eat into some
of our own ability to profit but it's
worth it because it goes out to the
customer faster we really want to just
you know we want to get them in we want
to get them out to people who bought
them and make sure everyone's happy with
it so that's something to consider you
talk again about computer cases those
typically come over on a boat because
they can weigh up to 50 pounds way too
expensive to put thousands or tens of
thousands of them on a plane at that
kind of weight and
they're typically on a boat and then you
deal with things like in the past
Coolermaster Corsair and EXT have had
stock shortages of some cases because of
strikes for example at the docks so and
then they just just sit on the water
waiting to come into support so that's
another small thing another one colors
so colors aren't really hard to get
right we've worked pretty hard on
consistency talking with the factory
getting the ink colors accurate and
exactly how we want them every time look
back at Noctua and they had that fan
color difference once which was because
run to run you can have some variants so
we've worked on that we learned kind of
on that front from nock to his fan stuff
previously couple other quick and small
things contrast and saturation something
we have to consider dimensions of when
you roll this mat up when it's rolled at
the factory into a tube like this we
have to make sure it's a limited
diameter so that it'll fit in the tubes
that we bought locally to ship them out
snap quality for the 10 millimeter snap
for the ground point distribution has a
cost
I don't ship them personally we have a
distributor for that Freight obviously
has cost pallets planes boats all that
stuff shipping time of course as noted
and then all the other fun things like
import duties taxes things like that so
yeah learned a lot about how much it
cost to make product and what the
involvement is to get it done you have
to stay on top of the fact that you're
working with to make sure the product
arrives protected make sure it's all
done right and it's it's constant PR and
human work just talking to the people
making the product to make sure
everything comes out how you want that's
really difficult so the whole process of
this even though we've made a really
cool product really happy with it it's
been a lot of work even with that stuff
aside it's informed our future reviews
of products ampuls so when in the past
I've said things like I really wish this
were 15 dollars cheaper well now I
understand just how difficult that can
be now there are times when I would
still absolutely demand that something
is cheaper but other than things like
that the deterrent cost down is pretty
difficult and so now that we've gone
this whole process start to finish
making a real product not just
merchandise not just a shirt where you
you know we make pretty cool shirts too
but we give them a design they print it
and then we ship it pretty simple to
make something like this that's fully
Kosta the anti-static mat it's special
materials we have to go to a factory
that knows what they're doing they make
stuff for clean rooms so they really
know what they're doing that's a lot of
steps it's a lot of research and then
for our reviews in the future now we
have this extra perspective that's
really valuable because I can look at
products from the perspective of not a
large manufacturer but someone who has
gone through the manufacturing process
which again highly valuable for
reviewing a product so let's go through
some of these first of all for this one
I've got here this is one of the newest
samples that just came in these are
going out in the next couple days if you
haven't already ordered one you should
pick it up stored on Karen's Nexus net
because we've got a couple left and
they're going out soon so the matte
material first of all you can see now
that this background color is the same
so it's just a straight black it's the
raw matte material as opposed previously
we had a dark gray background in between
all of the detail and that dark gray
paint although we liked it
we found that improved contrast if we
just went with a straight black matte
material so we can look at things like
for example the pin outs over here
really pop now and the blue for the logo
pops part of this is because we've
changed the backgrounds the contrast is
improved we've also talked to the
factory to make sure they improve
basically the saturation of the paint
make sure there's enough paint to really
make things bright also the millimeter
lines on the ruler so over here
millimeter lines now really pop out and
they're easier to see as well so lots of
small improvements that we've worked on
for this run I'll point out this as well
the actual ground points to the snap
it's called this is a a 10 millimeter
snap the ground point is something that
the factory punches in and then they cap
it on the back so this is smoothed over
it's not going to like dig into the
surface or anything and it also just
kind of looks nice it fits really snugly
you pop the ground point on there
everything works well and that's all
stuff that we've
worked on for the first production run
and now the follow-up runs and then we
go back to the box as I knocked over the
beginning of the video even just getting
the tubes
it's another moving part so as I said
earlier learning through the whole
process going through manufacturing a
product you realize one everything costs
money so I have to buy the mat I have to
pay for the ink to go on the mat we've
got to get the tubes to put them in we
have to get the manuals made we have to
get the ground points the anti-static
wrist straps all of these different
things there's distribution there's
shipping coming from the factory going
out to the customer and obviously that
goes through a distributor and I'm just
operating here in a garage right now so
it's something that we're taking really
seriously we're not making a ton of
money on it but the whole point is that
it's a damn cool product that I'm
actually pretty proud of and as a
completely side unexpected bonus again
learning more about what the
manufacturers go through so now when I'm
criticizing their products and I'm
asking that they drop the price a couple
bucks I've got that extra point to
consider where well now I know what they
go through can they actually do that but
we've learned a lot from it very happy
with it so as stated pick one up if you
want to and otherwise check back soon

where our other shirts and our two-tone
hoodies thanks for watching I'll see you
