episode as always you can leave your
questions in the comment section below
for the next episode and this time we
have a lot of good ones it's been a
while but we're back and I have several
questions that have been excuse me
we're Kim here that have been in the
waiting so thank you for your patience
let's get into it before that this video
is brought to you by be quiet and it's
straight power 11 series power supplies
the straight power 11 PS use ship from
450 Watts up to a thousand watts
accommodating most of the gaming PC
build requirements you'd encounter and
focuses on delivering a higher quality
power supply that doesn't sacrifice on
efficiency or stability noise is also a
heavy point for the straight power 11
using a 135 millimeters silent winds
three fan that can spin as low as 200
rpm for quieter low load operation learn
more at the link in the description
below so as always this is our Q&amp;amp;A
section
I'm currently filming at the old studio
at the house right now with the og wood
wall over there and the snowflake
joining me and we might teleport to the
normal studio in a moment
first question is regarding the Kington
card someone asked if you were mr.
moneybags gamer how high would you run
the power limit for daily use assuming
temps were okay not in an LM 2
application end because my co-host has
laughs we might as well move back to the
other studio now so one second and we're
back so the question about basically it
comes down to is it safe to overclock
GPUs 24/7
especially something like a kingpin
video card where it's built for really
high power overclocking and we had some
thoughts on this but when I hadn't
reached out to kingpin and ten anyway
and we also had Jacob from EVGA and copy
as well who's our main point of contact
over there we got answers from all three
so here's kingpins answer is pretty
straightforward it was quote I would for
sure max it out 144 percent or whatever
allows the card to get the highest
stable overclock without throttling
simple enough the next comment from
Jacob went a little bit more detailed on
some of it
and said if the viewer means power
target just max it the card is only
going to draw what it needs just raises
the ceiling and on a normal cooling
setup he would never reach a point that
would be detrimental to the GPU
regarding GPU lifespan under
overclocking without mods there are
enough safeguards built into the GPU to
prevent any long-term issues and went on
to say but if modded of course it's a
bit unknown I don't think there is
really good data on the long-term
effects if you mod the card and then
finally 10 Ilya responded as well and 10
does the the power engineering type work
on these cards and also an hour lab tour
you can see a lot of his equipment it's
really cool setup Ilya said this is
really two questions one is how power
limits affects GPU operation increasing
power limit allows a higher currents or
power consumption however even at 400
watts this is 35% higher than rated
design spec typically there is quite
significant amount of headroom left as
you know there is a process variance and
some GPUs leak more some less maxing out
power limits on stock biases 144 percent
on KPE without touching voltage will not
cause problems playing with voltage or
load line however is a different story
I'm still working on more details about
voltage tweaking for RTX KPE which will
be published on EVGA 0 C forum section
with the cards launch and just
intermission here it has launched since
this answer was provided to us so that
should be out there now Ilya went on to
say the second part of the question is
what are safe let's assume we want to
keep the card in operation for two to
three years at least power levels before
the GPU starts having issues this is a
bit of a gray area as nvidia and any
other ASIC vendor Intel AMD etc will
never publish this sort of data as it
directly represents margins and process
parameters which can often change over
time from our experience if you keep
voltage modest eg 10% increase or less
then it's hard to kill or degrade the
chip all that being said temperature is
much more important as a factor than the
power limiter itself as thermal stress
affects not only the silicon die but the
packaged PCB assembly and components
life like caps fans pumps you would want
to keep the GPU and 30 to 60 degrees
Celsius region for maximum lifetime
temperature is one of the factors why
modern smaller nodes cannot operate at
high voltages like the old-school
hardware as nodes get thinner operating
voltage levels will continue to go lower
and power delivery will continue to be
even more important in the future
there are already chips out there that
can operate from as low as 0.4 volts
core voltage for comparison old cards
like the 9800 GTX could work with
voltage droop between vrm and GPU as big
as 0.4 volts when doing zombie mods even
with Allen teapots directly attached to
the silicon die transistor density is so
high that with high-voltage little
transistors already overcooked by the
time the heat reaches the ellentube hot
service you may know that all
transistors electronic circuitry on the
modern FPGA chips like any CPU or GPU of
the last 10 years it's located on the
bottom side of the silicon die one
facing the PCB answers the question very
well so the answer is you're fine you
can max the slider the more detailed
part of the answer I got all of it but
just to emphasize a few of his points
heats of concern so Ilya mentioned that
temperature is a point of failure for
things like capacitors fans and pumps so
to expand on that with a pump like an
ace attack pump the spec for ASA tax
coolers is no higher than 60 degree
Celsius liquid temperature before
there's some permanent loss of liquids
through permeation and EVGA does use a
stack as its primary partner for a lot
of its cooling products like the EVGA
CLC series that's all ace attack so the
spec follows there but 60 degrees
Celsius liquid temperature is really
high you would need an extremely hot GP
or CPU to reach that level of liquid
temperature so I don't want people to
get scared here and see that their CPU
or their GPU is at sixty degrees Celsius
which is actually really good if it's
under load and then think that their
liquid will be 60 C and freak out and
think about it's killing the hardware
it's not so 60 C GPU or CV temperature
is way different than the liquid
temperature will ever be liquid leave
much lower than that
so anyway keep an eye on liquid
temperature some of the coolers out
there like the modern ASA tech stuff the
some of the kulit solutions have liquid
temperature monitoring
built-in they have little thermocouples
in there in the liquid and you can often
monitor it through hardware info 64 as
long as you have that USB cable attached
the same one that controls the led
colors and you can monitor it liquid
temperature that way if you're really
concerned about it or you can stick a
probe in yourself you have an open-loop
setup it's much easier to do but then
you're not dealing with the same type of
issue because it's an open-loop setup
there are a lot of different components
in that so there's different specs for
each one and obviously it shouldn't be
too hot but permeations not really that
much of a concern because you can easily
maintain it so anyway that's one aspect
the other is capacitors typically you
have caps that are rated at something
like 105 degrees Celsius for 5000 hours
or 10,000 hours or you might have
something low-end one that's 85 degrees
Celsius for 2,000 hours caps not always
gonna be that hot unless you keep it
under a hundred percent load in a really
thermally abusive environment so you
don't have to worry about this all too
much but on low-end components certainly
the capacitor life is one of the most
common points of failure so if you're in
the habit of trying to keep things alive
and the your you have a motherboard
that's been perfectly good but fail
there's something like that get good at
replacing capacitors because that's
probably the most effective way to bring
a component back to life it is often the
caps that fail depending on obviously
what you were doing with it before then
but anyway there's their answers I
it doesn't seem necessary to expand on
this further but yeah thank you
Ilia 10 and Jacob for helping out with
that I was straight from EVGA so
hopefully that helps you out this would
apply by the way to most other products
as well so if you buy most video cards
off the shelf you max up the power limit
unless you're going to do what they're
saying here like voltage mods you'll be
fine
so the obvious issue is that it draws
more power just make sure you have a
good enough power supply and you're fine
how do factory tours influence your
conclusions this was a great question so
Addison Martin asked asked this I think
this was a youtube comment I believe and
Addison Martin asked asked GN how will
all these factory to all these awesome
factories where's thank you very much
a vector judgment when reviewing new
products going forward do you think
you'll be able to give us consumers are
more fair and in depth review absolutely
so this is something we've talked about
before but the really cool thing the
behind-the-scenes stuff that hasn't made
it into those factory tour videos is
that we we get to sit down with these
p.m. as the product managers and talk at
length before we go through the factory
about like okay what is all this stuff
really cost and you know how long does
it take what's the product development
lifecycle
what's the manpower cost what's the
biggest bottleneck in the pipeline
what are your material limitations do
you have shortages or issues acquiring
materials things like that and that
really informs review of content because
you know that probably the most common
complaint in any review is well this is
a pretty good product but to be
competitive it really needs to be like
20 bucks cheaper or 50 bucks cheaper and
it's easy for all of us to say that of
course because we're not footing the
cost to make the product and you look at
the competitive marketplace and often it
is a true statement to be truly
competitive with existing solutions on
the market products do generally need to
be cheaper but to recover some of those
initial costs they often launch at a
higher price then we think is fair for
the consumer but doing these types of
tours and having that information behind
the scenes obviously informs us to know
that well okay there's a lot of moving
parts here the price isn't unfair in
that it's not asking a significant
amount of margin over the cost to make
the good even if it seems like it's
unfair as compared to competition so
there's kind of a few points a few
angles of fairness there and one of them
is is it fair to the consumer from the
manufacturers perspective and then is it
a reasonable price for the consumer to
pay from their perspective and fair from
the manufacturers perspective might be
something like with maybe say a case or
a keyboard maybe you're looking at like
thirty percent margin might go up to
fifty percent margin on some of these
products and if you're in that range
with that type of product you're feeling
pretty good about
but obviously everyone wants to profit
more so it just becomes a question of
how much can you push that margin before
you restrict your market to a point that
you have diminishing returns so you're
moving enough less volume that you're
making less money versus you know
switching it a bit but that's not
something that we really know a whole
lot about typically but these tours do
help us inform become informed on that
and be a bit smarter when we say what we
think was a shortcoming or we're not now
another thing that these help with is we
do learn what are the manufacturing
limitations so if there is well I wish
it had X great example USB type-c a lot
of people comment on our case reviews
when a case doesn't have USB type-c and
say I wish this case had USB type-c in
the front and we've certainly counted on
it in the past now Patrick and I you
know we've talked in the last episode
about bias in the industry and biases
Patrick and I don't really care about
USB type-c all that much so when we do a
case review it's reflective that we
don't care like we barely mention it and
some of you like it a lot but either way
one of the things we've learned from
these factory tours USB type-c
not so easy and not so cheap so we did
our factory tour of the cable factory we
learned that the operators are able to
make per operator a maximum of about 6
cables per hour and that's a skilled
technician and it's because of the
amount of manual wire routing involved
so that's the bottleneck is the
individual routing the sort of splaying
the wires now other machines the process
can make tens of thousands of these
types of cables per day it's just at
some point you have a bottleneck and six
per hour per person force playing the
wires is obviously a massive bottleneck
we've also learned that the pricing for
example unfortunately I can't give
specifics on this but I can say that USB
type-c is somewhere in the range of
seven to ten times more expensive than
just a normal USB three header on the
front of the case and depending on how
much it's been validated some of you
thought you were making
whereas comments in that video saying
well but 10 times 20 cents isn't that
much or 10 times 2 cents it's not it's a
it's a lot more than that like I can't
give you a number I can tell you it's in
the dollars range not in the pennies
range so this is a big deal like if you
want to add USB type-c to a case it's
not gonna happen
on a $40 case it will barely happen on a
$50 case if you make a lot of sacrifices
like if you start cutting corners on
quality if you eliminate fans then you
can make it happen
so this is not a cheap thing and that
has informed us as well other things
we've learned just like I guess
understanding this supply chain so this
was kind of a funny thing to go on a
tangent here
some people were we're sort of upset
about the like how cardboard is made in
house screws are made videos even though
the screw and really well so the the
kind of funny thing to me is these are
the same people often who praise our
content for going like really hardcore
in-depth on detail and then when we do
it for factories they're like why are
you talking about how screws are made
well because it's in it's in literally
every single product we review so it's
important to know about and that's part
of like the GM like let's let's just go
really ham with the depth on this
specific Thane until there's nothing
left to talk about ever again so what we
learned though supply chains massive
obviously and interestingly all these
companies the the factories are pretty
close to each other so for Coolermaster
coolermaster works with a cable factory
and i think it's i want to say it's in
shenzhen they work with a screw factory
in either like dong-gwon or shenzhen as
well they work with a their main
factories in hey Joe and if these words
mean nothing to you they're different
parts of of China and they're all within
roughly about maybe an hour to an hour
and a half of each other driving so this
is important and it's it's interesting
to learn because now it's like oh okay
so Coolermaster makes the product they
assemble it in this factory
maybe who a Joe and once it's done away
Joey it can it needs a box and so they
go down the street 25 minutes to the box
factory and there's your box and it's a
factory that makes just millions of
dollars worth of boxes annually for all
kinds of companies and so there's all
these different moving parts to make the
product you ultimately get where by the
time you get it there's been dozens of
hands on the product from the box to the
PCB that you may never see inside of the
product and there's also been
potentially half a dozen companies that
have had hands on some part of the
product and all of that is logistical II
challenging and expensive obviously but
you know it makes more sense still to do
this than to for coolermaster as another
example to make its own screws because
that's just why why would they bother
doing that when they go to a factory
that makes millions of them a month and
get them for far cheaper than using
their own expense of floor space to put
like a screw shop like a screw machining
shop let's rephrase that so anyway yeah
it's really taught us a lot and I don't
know I think going forward what new
perspective will we have for consumers I
think that perspective we will have is
I'll be able to to give you all more
detail on you why does this product cost
what it does and then okay let's go
through some of the materials now that I
know more about material costs time
costs and let's see if it's fair let's
see if it's actually a reasonable price
for the manufacturer to charge whether
or not it's reasonable for you to pay it
given the competitive landscape we'd
always look at it in a vacuum from that
perspective so that'll help and then
stuff like knowing timelines will help
significantly because now I understand
better like how long it takes to make
different types of products and we kind
of knew this before but now we better
understand which part takes so long so
tooling can take several months to get
tooling made and finalized and can cost
upwards of a million dollars to make all
of it and and so that's valuable to know
because now we know when we get a case
in here as an easy example we know that
the tooling for that case if it's not
going to reuse has been finalized for
at least six months at this point likely
maybe three depend on how fast the
company is at making their product so
it's all valuable to know but I don't
want to go too crazy on this but yeah I
guess one other thing to the MSI
radiation lab tour we did it was very
educational because we learned you know
about all these different certifications
that companies have to get to sell in
different regions of the world and
that's tremendously involved I mean MSI
as an example they have their own semi
anechoic chamber it's not like the most
advanced one I've ever been in but it's
more advanced than most people have and
they have their own radiation lab and
these things aren't to slap a C label on
their products but it's to validate that
their product needs to spec they have a
pretty tight tolerance for it and as
long as it meets the spec what they then
do is send that product out to be
validated by a third party really
expensive lab and get the government or
the organisation stamps on it that they
need so that was really interesting to
learn as well as you know like all these
small steps you don't even think about
like a video card is tremendously
complex obviously not even counting the
GPU and you kind of take some stuff for
granted like the i/o DisplayPort HDMI
not something we really think too hard
about and certainly not something we
think needs validated at this point for
the most part because it's so known but
every one of these cards and
motherboards has to go through
validation and that's a lot of extra
steps so what so what's the next let's
do the next question that was a great
one though I do want to talk about it
some more but we'll stop there next one
where does Gao actually quick note
please for those of you watching this
please leave more questions about the
factory tours below I saw a lot of
questions about the factory tours about
like manufacturing and China being in
China working with the companies touring
the different facilities how automation
works how different products are made
and stuff like that please leave your
questions below I saw a lot of them on
the factory tours but it's much easier
for me to collect them if they are down
there in the comments section of ask to
you
you can also press on the patreon
discord if you would like to so where we
have the bonus episode of ask GM anyway
yeah I would love to answer more fashion
questions please leave them in the
comments next one where does GM draw the
line for depth atom McQueen said hi
Steve I'm always wondering which level
of knowledge a good tech journalist
needs to make great content one of the
advantages of G n is sometimes GN has
much deeper dig into the implementation
details other than just benchmarking but
on the other hand I never see GN talking
about source code level things like
compiler ir which is commonly used in
graphics drivers and would impact
performance I totally understand
thinking too deep into source code if
there is would make G n more like open
source mail list but too shallow also
makes G oh not so GN so how does GN
balance between a hardcore source code
fpga spec level details against plain
benchmarking although the GN method of
benchmarking is already more scientific
than a lot of other tech supers so good
question driver level source code isn't
something we're doing so I and I suspect
you obviously understand that given your
question where do we draw the line is
how I'm going to interpret this question
I think where we draw the line is
largely based upon our level of
competence and knowledge on the topic so
over the years one thing longtime
viewers will have noticed is that we've
gotten more detailed and more confident
in the details as we've gone so one
thing that we've sort of phased out is
in video card reviews CB reviews we
basically never show a spec sheet
anymore of what the product has respects
like oh I'll talk through it for a
minute or so before we get into the
charts but we don't just show the spec
sheet what we used to do is spend maybe
five minutes talking about just
basically reading the spec sheet and
then might deviate a little bit and
explain what some of these things mean
but years and years ago my knowledge was
an hour knowledge as a team wasn't there
it's really expand on it so it was
reading a brochure and I didn't really
like that content approach we've now
eliminated it we understand these specs
at this point we've explained them in
great detail and other content pieces
but we've mostly eliminated going
through the spec sheet because it's like
we know
enough now about other aspects of the
product that if it's something you can
just look up on our website or another
website and look at a spec sheet there's
really no reason for us to spend minutes
reading on its it's so inefficient to
read it on camera compared to just
looking at it so that's something we've
eliminated we've drawn a line sort of at
the low end of like this is not
interesting enough to get into the video
it's it's not something we can provide
enough value on because it's literally
reading a spec sheet so we drew a line
to the bottom end cut that out and made
an extra couple of minutes of up to five
minutes that we can spend on other stuff
which is obviously very important we
draw lines that we try to keep it at
like 20 to 25 minutes max for most
reviews for really important content
I'll allow up to about 30 occasionally
we go over 30 but 30 is like a really
hard limit of it's a psychological limit
it's kind of like when you see something
that's $9 99 times 999 instead of 10 so
29 minutes versus 31 minutes there's a
big difference in how many people click
on the video so that's where we draw the
line in terms of content length now that
dictates a bit where we draw the line
for content depth because at some point
we have to cut it off for time reasons
to make sure the video scene is to cut
it off for financial reasons because if
I want to sustain the channel then
sometimes it makes more sense to split
content into multiple pieces and have
two 20 minute episodes instead of one 40
minute episode and this isn't just a
financial thing either it's a we put a
lot of work into this and want to make
sure people actually see it because it's
disappointing if they don't so sometimes
that makes more sense in terms of depth
answering your question if it's a topic
I don't feel great about in my depth of
knowledge and none of my team members
know much about it then we'll do some
research we'll try to talk to some
experts if it's an important topic and
maybe include some quotes from them but
we're not going to expand on it from
there because it's obvious when you're
out of your depth and it doesn't provide
any value to speak in vagaries and
ambiguity and sometimes we do speak in
ambiguity and vagaries normally it's for
reasons that are related to NDA's or
embargoes to try and get like a little
bit of information out there without
breaking any rules but yeah it's just if
it's not something we know a lot about
that's
that's the line so obviously our
knowledge base as a team is expanding as
we grow and he's been working on things
like RT ax and DX are in Unreal Engine
so that has informed us greatly in that
aspect of things Patrick's been learning
more about the games he's testing the
software he's testing we've done
research on all these different software
solutions for CPU benchmarks well any
more about how case thermals behave and
so all of this allows us to get more
detailed in our reviews but it's a it's
a really gradual growing process and
just we're not to use your example again
we're not going to jump into something
like source code level discussion
because we don't understand it
so I could find someone who could put
some words in my mouth but that doesn't
really seem genuine so the most will do
for that kind of stuff is if it's a
really interesting topic it's likely I
don't know what's interesting because I
don't know enough about the topic to
know that it's interesting so if it's an
important topic always feel free to let
us know Twitter is an easy way at
Cambridge Nexus patreon discord is a
great one
you got a patreon.com slash gamers nexus
tag me in the discord I see them I don't
always respond but I do see them and
read them and and then what we can do is
reach out to some experts and hopefully
get some answers and minimally mention
their answers but might not going to
death beyond that if we're not
knowledgeable in the area hopefully that
answers it though it's I mean it's it's
pretty straightforward and genuine it's
it's do we understand it yes or no now
obviously stuff we understand doesn't
always get in the video either just
because of content length or maybe it
doesn't really fit the topic or whatever
but you can always post a simple comment
or tag us on discord or whatever Twitter
and let us know like hey I noticed that
you guys didn't mention this this aspect
of the product could you expand on that
and maybe we'll find time to do so in a
news topic or something when is
replacing GPA it's worth it gam says how
old does a GPU have to be before
disassembling to replace stock paste
becomes a worthwhile endeavor so dust
mostly is the answer it is worth
replacing it as soon as like the coolers
just discussed in once you notice that
your thermals start you're on a happy
with them and it might be immediately
then it's worth replacing it now some
card is worth replacing right away
depends on the quality of the card and
in general the pace from factory is not
always that great so you can typically
get improvements by throwing like even
just some cheap like Arctic on there RQ
comics for or something will often be an
improvement over the factory level
application thermal grizzly of course is
a longtime sponsor of ours I don't know
if they're I don't think they're
sponsoring we I think we've served their
ads for the month but so cryo not if you
want something really high-end and
expensive and good that's another option
but the the answer is is it hotter than
you're comfortable with and also if
you're overclocking it and you feel like
you can get a couple more megahertz
improvement with a lower temperature
which every five degrees matters then
it's time to replace the paste yeah I
would probably go based on when you do
your first dust cleansing of the whole
system it might be a good time to
replace the paste and just you know
don't expect wonders but you should
expect some improvement especially if
dust is like getting in there it's you
know it's small it can kind of get
around the edges of the cold plate and
really make things gross let's do just
two more
apparently this Sony a7 3r turns off
after like 30 minutes so or doesn't it
stops recording so we're redoing the
last two questions here swifty bastard
from from the GN discord asks Steve what
do the lines at the end of your bar
charts mean why are they only for 1%
letters point one percent low bar is not
the average for FPS comparisons so we
answered this already in the GN discord
which you can join by going to
patreon.com/scishow cameras nexus put
your questions I answered it previously
but there's also a bar on the average
one it's just it's so small because the
deviation on that chart is basically
zero for average that you couldn't
really see it but so the bars at the end
of the chart there's this little eye
that was rotated 90 degrees and that eye
indicates the sort of a bracket of our
standard deviation or our margin of
error depending on the test on the chart
to illustrate when a benchmark is is
meaningfully different and measurably
different than another product that was
benchmarked so the point of adding those
was
bring some reality back to the benchmark
in space where people are so often
attached to one company exceeding their
succeeding over the other one that they
forget that a difference of two fps
might be completely margin of error and
totally irrelevant now even if it's not
margin of error and it's measurable it's
still imperceptible in that examples are
still irrelevant but for a different
reason so not every test is the same
tests are all imperfect and the variance
for different types of tests can be
quite large or it could be basically
nothing like in the chart you noticed
0.1% low as 1% lows have a pretty wide
variance because the nature of them is
that it's a more restricted set of data
it's excursions from the mean and so
that ends up being where you'll have
that that margin of error that standard
deviation bar on the chart be a bit
wider so if we see something like a
result that's 80 FPS 0.1% low for
product a and 68 FPS point one percent
low for product B if the two numbers
there are within that deviation of each
other there with an error of each other
you cannot fairly state that the one
with 80 is better than the one at 68
because if they're within especially if
they're well with an error maybe there's
like a 12 FPS variance on that chart
then it is unfair to come to that
conclusion because you can't we wouldn't
have the test resolution to declare that
one is significantly meaningfully better
than the other even if the data reflects
that these two numbers have ones bigger
than the other so the point is just you
know when you're looking at the charts
we do this and script around it so
hopefully you don't have to do too much
work but if you're looking at the charts
and trying to determine which products
better than the other take a look at
those bars we try to get them on every
chart sometimes we miss it but take a
look at the bars and if you see two
results are within range of each other
they're really not meaningfully
different like we can't we can't see the
difference in in our testing procedure
our testing method for that game so yeah
what we do is we take all the test
results we get standard deviation or we
calculate margin of error depending and
and then with that we can determine how
much variance there is
Rondon for each game for each product so
if you have like a game that's scoring
in the range of 200 300 FPS you could
easily have depending on the game the
engine a variance of maybe like 10 and
so if we have a product that's at 300
FPS another product that's at 292 FPS
you could say that the one at 300 better
or you could be realistic and look at
the error bars and see that actually
they are functionally the same and
that's normally the phrasing that we use
when we describe results that are within
error so that's what it just you know
keep keep your expectations within the
realm of reality because testing is all
imperfect and so everything is going to
have some error baked and not all
results are significant in terms of
their superiority over the next result
down on the chart and you could have
things that are fairly close to each
other that are actually basically the
same at the end of the day so not
getting too caught up in really small
differences and then I guess other than
that we we build these data sets based
on when you see a chart with like 20
CPUs or GPS or whatever and you see a
review go up that might have multiple
different games tested with a lot of
different products there's thousands and
thousands of cells of data there that we
go through for all these tests for all
these products and all these games and
so on you end up with really complicated
reviews there's really there's a lot of
data to look at and start piecing
together what kind of range you have for
each game and should we eliminate this
product or this game from the test
because the variance is too high and it
can't be trusted or whatever I'm sorting
right yeah the answer is those bars
illustrate the expected or the known
test range based on looking at all the
data we have and coming to a margin of
error or a standard deviation for that
title so that's the answer that one next
one last one was smoke father two months
ago said Steve looks like a retired
wrestler I think you're thinking of hype
B's Steve who last made an appearance at
CES my long-lost cousin that's over this
one as always if you want to leave
questions in the comment section below
I'll try to get them for next time if
you come up with a question in two or
three weeks from now and I want to make
sure it's seen posted on this video not
on a future video come back here and
post it here so I can see it or you can
go to patreon.com/scishow and nexus
support us there and join our discord
through the integration and post your
comment in the ask GN questions section
where i will look through for the next
episode we have a patrons ask TN episode
going up separately on that channel so
if you want to check it out and you're a
patreon backer you can get access to
that or you can sign up and get access
to it and yeah I stored our cameras
access dotnet to pick up a shirt like a
teal version of this one this was
limited but there's still teal one out
there or the mod mats thank you for
watching subscribe for more I'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
