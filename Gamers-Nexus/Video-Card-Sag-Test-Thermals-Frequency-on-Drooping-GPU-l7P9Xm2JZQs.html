images of g/b torture that is against
international conventions look at it
look don't try and look away from the
brutal slow dismemberment of gigabytes
at GT X 1080 Ti extreme this video card
was one of the lowest rated GT X 1080
eyes that we reviewed last year or well
two years ago now ending up the least
recommended out of every card we tested
this was largely due to poor assembly
quality using an odd mix of through
bolts and heavy mounting hardware that
added nothing structurally nor thermally
to the design it's also because the
plastic shroud creaks when pressed like
McDonald's toy plastic it isn't really
form-fitting and the card is bulky to a
degree of pointlessness when we tested
the 1080 TI extreme we found that its
thermal performance was worse than
competition that measured 30 percent
smaller even when those normalized at
240 DBA and that's because the extreme
just doesn't make great contact with
much of anything now after a year of
forced labor in our oldest rendering rig
we get to see the real world side effect
of a needlessly heavy card that's poorly
reinforced internally and has been
sagging for a year that's what we're
testing today before that this video is
brought to you by thermal grizzly and
their high-end thermal compounds thermal
grizzly makes cryo not paste for high
thermal performance and conductivity
without being electrically conductive so
you don't have to worry about shorting
components Crona is particularly good
for replacing stock GPU pastes as cryo
not is a non curing compound learn more
at the link in the description below
here's our test system for the GPU sag
thermal testing it's about as real-world
as it gets
especially from us we typically put
everything an open-air bench for
performance testing and run through the
third the the numbers in a very
standardized way whether that's thermal
or performance or whatever in this
instance it's a one-off test so we don't
need wide sweeping standardization and
we can do it in an actual system now the
fall here of course as always is that we
have a sample size of one and that
different GPUs different video card
assemblies will have different
performance numbers depending on how
they sag over time but this is a pretty
damn extreme example if only because the
name of the card is 1080 Ti extreme but
is an extreme example of sag because we
have b-roll shots of this but you
probably see it in a role too
all I have to do is apply some upward
pressure and there's like an inch of
drop off or something so it's it's
pretty severe and what we're doing is we
have it in a PMO one we've got three
front intake fans its stock PMO one they
are at max speed everything's controlled
within this system so all fans are
controlled the intake fans are all 100%
speed the GPU fan for the Kart that's
under test is 55% speed locked for all
tests which is intentional because it
will all otherwise fluctuate and then
all the data is invalid and we also are
logging frequency which is important
because nvidia pascal cards are really
heavy with the clock gating to a point
where if the thermals look the same it
might be possible that the frequency is
significantly higher and one test on the
other depending on how it was down
clocking based on temperature so that's
all controlled for and accounted for we
do test with the bottom card installed
and removed depending on what we're
looking at the bottom card here isn't
actually producing any load so there's
no radiative heat coming off the
backside and not any meaningful amount
the fans add about it's at the minimum
speed of 23% for the lower card it's a
980 TI it's not doing anything the only
reason it's there is to create a closer
barrier to the sagging card because as
this sags obviously it's going to cut
off some of that intake area at the
front of the two cards so that's why
that's there and I think that covers
most of what you need to know about the
test setup if you have further questions
we'll have a short article about this as
well with the system components but
that's more or less it so it's a
real-world test what we're gonna do is
see in this real system that we used for
like I don't know a couple years but
about a year with that card in it is
there a performance decay in any
meaningful fashion from the card sagging
versus resolution and the resolution was
I gave Patrick the job of I said your
job is to figure out how to make this
not sag anymore and he took some wire
that you used to hang a pic
and tied it around the the cables or the
end of the card and supported it to one
of the screws in the top of the case
actually where it's brilliantly we
wouldn't recommend it it looks awful but
it works really well so for testing
purposes that was our solution if you
want to actually fix it there's plenty
of brackets you can buy and shove in
there for this test with dual GPUs you
can just put something between the two
cards but the goal is to not obstruct
the fans so we don't change the intake
parameters during the test so let's get
through the numbers that's that's all
the test setup let's go through the
thermal numbers we've got a additional
testing of thermocouples on some of the
components as well so we can see how the
MOSFETs and the vram fare with GPU sag
this extreme in the testing with two GPS
installed
we measured the performance at when
sagging at forty nine point five degrees
over ambient for the Gigabyte extreme
1080 TI
or forty eight point one degrees celsius
over a means when sag is eliminated and
fixed with our wire this difference is
outside of our error margins but it is
overall insignificant the same is true
when looking at single GPU numbers where
we've plotted an average temperature of
42 point seven degrees over ambient with
sag or 42 point one without sag this is
also within error margins and not
significantly different and we don't
have the test resolution here to claim
that one is superior than the other
they're functionally the same as the
sort of interesting aside this chart
does consequently point out how a second
GPU even when idle will impact their own
performance of the primary GPU and that
effect is is exacerbated when the second
GPU is doing work keep in mind that this
is just one GPU and that we can't draw
conclusions for all sagging GPU
configurations from these numbers it's
just the extreme two other important
factors come into play as well both of
which we'll look at next first
Nvidia's GPU boosting algorithm is
heavily thermal dependent which means
that the difference in temperature that
we're seeing which is not much could be
complicated by how the GPU clock is
changing pursuant to that temperature so
there may be knock-on effects and
frequency that means look at second
component temperatures particularly
toward the right edge of the PCB like
MOSFETs could be more affected than GPU
core temperature well attached
thermocouples in a moment to look at
MOSFET and vram thermals
as for GPU frequency this overtime plot
will illustrate that pattern well first
we'll plot the GPU thermals again once
we reach steady state we begin averaging
over 2,000 cells of data for the thermal
numbers presented a moment ago that data
came from this distribution though note
that we've chopped the chart at 2100
seconds it's really the same the Sagan
GPU is consistently about one degree
warmer than the non sagging GPU which
makes sense when considering the
distance between the first and second
cards has increased thus allowing more
air to the primary card under test more
importantly here's a look at the
frequency for the SAG in GPU overall one
steady state is reached the average GPU
frequency is exactly 1621 0.3 megahertz
for the test again that's at
steady-state so there's no further
thermal movement next plotting the
frequency line for the non sagging GPU
after propping up the same gigabyte
1080i extreme with an unobstructed block
we see an average steady state frequency
of 1650 6.9 megahertz exactly this
increase is about 35 megahertz but our
error margin for frequency measurement
in this test is approximately 15
megahertz based on a lot of data where
we've been able to look at the standard
deviation so there's not much
significant change here keep in mind
that fir mark is also a power virus so
if you're questioning why that frequency
looks low in general it's because
frequency is instantiated differently in
this workload than in gaming scenarios
because of how the drivers are written
so overall frequency will be scaled
lower below gaming frequencies but we
can still use it as an indicator of
performance realistically this isn't all
that important it's basically the
difference between one of the board
partners pre overclocked configurations
versus and others so you can make the
case that maybe a higher stock clocked
GPU that sags is about as useful as a
lower stock clock CPU that doesn't sag
but beyond that there's not really a
difference and even that difference is
questionable as it's very close to error
margin so there's a bit of a difference
here in terms of raw numbers but not one
in terms of really meaningful impact
you're talking one two three FPS average
difference depending on the game so not
a big change we need to see what this
looks like with a single GPU though
plotted over time again we see just how
little variance there is between the
thermal results honestly
GPU configuration our scripting allows
the testing to align almost perfectly in
this plot and with less than one degree
Delta second a second we can call this a
wash it's well within error margins
adding frequency to the plot we can see
that frequency variation is almost zero
once that steady-state we average the
frequencies to be sixteen thirty two
point two megahertz for the sagging card
and sixteen thirty three point four
megahertz for the non sagging card we
are within our rough fifteen megahertz
error margin and also within margin of
the higher frequency card or very close
to it anyway for the dual GPU test so
far there aren't huge differences the
last place the check would be component
temperatures so we removed the GPU and
disassembled it then reassembled it with
thermocouples on a hotspot MOSFET and
gddr5 X memory module keep in mind that
this test data is incomparable to the
previous data as it required disassembly
and so new paste was applied we ran two
configurations single GPU with sag and
single GPU without sag comparable to
each other directly for this task we
measured GPU core thermals as within one
degree of each other yet again placing
within range of our first round of test
results note that these aren't
incomparable again as thrown face change
but the proximity to the previous
results is reassuring of test
methodology for gddr5 X memory module
thermals we measured the sagging card at
fifty one point eight degrees over
ambient and the non sagging card at
fifty one point three degrees over
ambient both are well within spec and
also well within error margins
establishing no meaningful difference
MOSFET temperatures were within half a
degree of each other also well within
error margins and we're not anywhere
close to throttling if anyone's
wondering about that were for about
seventy degrees away from that so even
when trying to find thermal differences
in board components like the MOSFET
toward the right edge we still could not
establish a meaningful Delta the dual
GPU configuration produced the largest
gap or the most promising difference in
thermals earlier but even that was minor
and the frequency difference really kind
of becomes insignificant given the
natural variants and how the program
operates this could also be used as a
stand-in for cases where the PSU shroud
is excessively close to the GPU same
idea as a dual GPU test here keeping in
mind that this is a a single card
configuration it's a while it's a single
configuration it's got one card or
two cards but it's all the same fixed
hardware it's the same GPU ultimately
that we're testing it's not like we had
multiple that are sagging here keeping
that in mind we couldn't measure a
meaningful thermal difference really in
any way in this setup so sometimes
there's a difference of about a degree
and sometimes it was enough to start
exiting margins of error but even then
it's just it's not meaningful it doesn't
really show up on the radar and except
for in extremely controlled scenarios
and testing scenarios and environments
it's not a number that you will be able
to to produce as a user and confidently
no there's a difference with this setup
now that's not going to be true globally
so if you have an instance of GPU sag
where you saw the opposite please leave
a comment below let us know what card it
was and did you do anything to fix it
because of course this isn't a
representative of all video cards ever
there are a lot of cards that sag out
there a lot of really heavy cards but it
is representative of some of them and so
from that perspective it wasn't really a
thermal concern ultimately it wasn't
really a performance concern we do have
concerns though one of course
aesthetically it just looks bad it's not
a good look anyone who doesn't know
computers look at it probably won't know
the difference
anyone who does know computers if they
look in the system all they're gonna see
is GPU sag so that's enough reason for
some people to to be bothered by this to
a point of fixing it or maybe buying a
different card next time maybe something
that's not as heavy or pointlessly heavy
as this one is a second concern over
time the card can pull itself further
and further away from PCIe slot now will
it ever get far enough where contact
between the pins is reduced to a point
of maybe creating some flicker or you
lose display out occasionally that
depends again on the configuration
depends on the case depends on how
secure everything is it's possible
though we found some forum posts where
that happens so potential concern but
something that can be fixed by just
restocking the cards though it's gonna
fall out and crush anything it's just
that it's it's slowly pulling away from
that socket and it's it's just a contact
could become poor with time
how relevant that is well probably not
super relevant but something to keep in
mind something annoying the troubleshoot
if you run into that issue third concern
is that over time some cards that are
particularly heavy on the right side
like this one is the right side being
towards the camera right now
those might have less right side support
you might start seeing pads pulling away
just slightly from some of those farther
right vrm or power componentry
so like the MOSFETs would be about as
far to the side as you can get before
you start getting into minor voltage
rails and things like that that aren't
that important to measure or even that
hot but the MOSFET line is definitely
the the more susceptible to a thermal of
had pulling away with time as the
heatsink sags
and this is more likely going to be a
problem where the PCB is supported to a
point either by back plate or or just by
better structural engineering than this
card as if the PCB is supported to a
point where it's relatively straight but
the cooler is sagging which is not the
scenario we have on this card then
you're gonna start seeing some
separation of the cooler from the
components it's contacting and that's
where you'll notice the MOSFET the vram
temperatures maybe they're closer to the
core though start to rise so that is the
bigger concern here and how relevant
that is to you will depend on the card
so for this one the card that we have
the 1080i extreme gigabyte card the
whole thing is sagging all of it so the
upside of that is that the PCB remains
in contact the components remain in
contact with the cooler the downside is
that the entire video card is sagging so
I take the good with the bad I guess but
yeah the bigger concern is just going to
be check the card that you have if it is
drooping a bit and look in there and see
can you still see the thermal pad as
contacting the component or is it
starting to peel away with the heatsink
as the PCB might remain straight and
that's just going to depend on the
design of the card and sort of the the
structural configuration of the cooler
what does it have in there to support
the backplate versus support the cooler
and is it lopsided to the point of just
only the backplate in the PCB and not
the cooler but thermally
performance-wise not a huge difference
so we didn't really expect that to be
honest the the most noticeable
difference will be if you have a case or
a shroud or a video card component or
something close to the card that's
sagging because then all it's doing is
is just sort of truncating that window
where air can get in and that'll reduce
the amount of air flow to the card but
that's a secondary effect not a primary
effect of the GPU sag so pretty
interesting case study but that's all it
is if you have cards that are really bad
maybe you have one that you know we have
already like you've seen us review the
card let us know what it is and we can
consider looking at it this was in here
for well since we got it we take the
worst components we review and we put
them in production systems sometimes it
works better than others and so it's had
a long time to just let gravity take its
course and we have plenty of other cards
so if there's one you're especially
interested in and every one up with that
to the top and we'll consider it for
future look that's it for this one as
always you can subscribe for more and
you should or you can get a stored on
