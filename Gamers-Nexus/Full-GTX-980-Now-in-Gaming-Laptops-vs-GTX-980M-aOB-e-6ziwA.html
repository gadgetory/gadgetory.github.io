phases hey everyone i'm steve from
gamers nexus dotnet and today we're
talking about the gtx 980 video card so
this is old news the 980 came out about
a year ago but why are we talking about
it now well nvidia has now put out the
gtx 980 in notebooks and this is
particularly interesting because the
fold desktop GPU is what's being moved
to notebooks and that's unheard of
really up until this point you generally
find a slimmed down version of the same
GPU same architecture in notebooks so
the gtx 980 em would be all that was
available at the high end up until this
point and at the very best you'd find
two of them in sli and things like the
GTA t which is a an MSI notebook that
has a mechanical keyboard so i had two
of them in sli but the gtx 980 em is
about thirty-five percent less powerful
than the desktop gtx 980 and if you look
at any mobile component and vidya intel
or AMD all three of them make the same
decisions where they're slimming down
their offerings in order to fit the
portables format so when I say mobile or
portables in this video I'm referring to
things like laptops whether their
desktop replacements like this one this
is an MSI gt70 to that's been rebranded
by CyberPower or they're thinner options
like the Auris which is another unit
that has the GTX 980 coming out and
that's I think less than an inch so
we're going to cycle through a bunch of
images of laptops in this video all of
them that you're looking at the
exception of this one are items that
have the GTX 980 in them and the thing
we're focusing on here today is going
over the specs the 980 verse 29 ATM the
expectations and the overclocking
Headroom offered by a GTX 980 which is
somewhat generous compared to the
previous mobile or portable offerings by
Nvidia and the Intel all of them really
so it's it's pretty interesting stuff we
don't have a full review yet but it is
forthcoming I have a couple of systems
on the way and obviously until we get
that review up I would advise you to
hold your purchases and wait to see what
we actually think of it when it's
performing but we're going to talk about
how it looks on paper
they what you're looking at right now is
a chart of the GTX 980 m and the GTX 980
specs and it should be noted that the
nine ATM despite its name is not the
same as the desktop 980 it uses the same
base Maxwell architecture and it even
uses the GM 204 GPU but it's been
modified so some cores are disabled you
see 1536 cores versus 2048 on the GTX
980 desktop unit which is now found in
notebooks just to clarify that and the 9
ATM has a 10 38 megahertz base clock
against the 11 26 megahertz base clock
of the GTX 980 as found in notebooks and
desktops and that difference is actually
fairly big and will show an impact in
gaming FPS we've tested this in the past
especially with the 980 TI and you'll
also see that 980 has a significantly
higher texture fill rate you can see our
other video on the channel search the
channel for texture fill rate or filter
rate to learn more about that it's got
more TM use faster memory higher
bandwidth and a memory capacity of
either 4 or 8 gigabytes depending on the
OEM with the 980 I'm shipping in
basically the same 8 gigabytes but a lot
fewer TM use and slower memory and
things like that the GTX 980 is promised
to be about thirty five percent faster
than the GTX 980 m and about two times
faster than the gtx 880 am which had a
somewhat short seeming lifespan in the
face of the 900 series launch even on
mobile and portable units and if we look
at the concerns here the big one is
going to be thermal dissipation and this
is something that we specialize in
testing when it comes to this type of
technology so we'll certainly be looking
at that as it comes out but we did have
a hands-on session with the GTX 980 in
several notebooks and got a quick feel
for how it all works so the main items
of note here are that the GTX 980 in
notebooks has a minimum requirement of a
four-phase vrm imposed by Nvidia on the
manufacturer and that's actually
significant because the vrm phases
normally in a notebook you'll see maybe
three phases on average but if you're at
four
eight which is the range that nvidia has
imposed then you've got more phases to
spread the heat across and that will
allow for obviously you get cleaner
voltage delivery so you have a more
stable clock if you're overclocking
that's important for overclocking but on
the thermal side you have more phases so
that you have more physical space and
more chokes more capacitors and
potentially stronger MOSFETs where
you're setting and feeding all the power
through so that should one clean the
power as I said end to it should
mitigate the heat generated in the
process of feeding voltage to the GPU
itself so that's one of the main items
for helping with the thermals and with
the overclocking potential on the
overclock inside and vidya has stated
that it is a fully unlocked GPU for
overclocking you can tune the base clock
frequency basically until it stops
working you can tune the memory
frequency as expected also until it
stops working and then in their new
suite which is being skinned by the OEM
manufacturers you can set a custom fan
curve so that's pretty familiar and
uninteresting to a lot of us it's the
same as you see in precision or
afterburner any of the other software
where you can just set a fan curve based
on your needs so those needs are
normally going to be a battle between
performance thermally and FPS wise and
noise levels if you want lower noise
levels you set a less aggressive fan
curb which means you run hotter but
quieter for overclocking there is no
control over the voltage right now so
you can't over volt the desktop version
of the GTX 980 as found in a notebook
even though you can in a desktop version
and there's also no power percent target
control so you're stuck at a hundred
percent of the power target at all times
which in the desktop version the actual
desktop version that you find in
desktops you have some Headroom to
increase it 110 / 725 % depend on your
BIOS manufacture things like that and I
gives you more Headroom to overclock so
there are limitations and those
limitations are likely bound by things
like thermals and TDP but when we asked
our overvoltage Nvidia told us in our
meeting that it is a distinct
possibility that they will be looking
into
for the future but at launch / Bolton
will not be available for the gtx 980 as
found in notebooks what you're looking
at now is the only benchmark that we
have available it was provided by Nvidia
so massive truck of salt recommended
they normally are fairly accurate I'll
say but our testing methodology does
differ from theirs and ours is based
obviously in being objective and
unbiased so we will be testing this
ourselves to validate everything but
this does give us a base look at the
frame rates in the games shown and is
generally reliable they say The Witcher
3 runs in the 60 FPS range at ultra 1080
which is a very big promise and if it
can be done on notebooks which it should
be able to because it can be done on the
desktop version then that's a big gain
for NVIDIA a couple of interesting
things here test methodology for the GTX
980 and notebooks will be unique because
we're testing a component we have a
desktop version of but we don't have the
same CPU RAM things like that because a
laptop you find like the i7 4720 HQ or
similar and different ram speed or pin
count certainly and voltages and things
like that so there's a lot of disparity
in the hardware normally we have a
constant bench and all we change is the
various video cards in this case we're
going to have two different laptops will
be testing this gtx 980 M laptop against
a new GT 72 same model with a 980 so
that's easy but the disparity comes in
when we start looking at desktop cards
vs the 980 laptop which will do just
because it's desktop which desktop in
terms of GPU architecture and GPU
performance so that'll be fun to do but
it will be a unique challenge and test
methodology we'll talk all about that in
the video which is out in terms of these
laptops they should be dropping no later
than October fourth from some
manufacturers others will have them
available for order effectively
immediately at the posting of this video
we are yet unsure of prices I'm sure
they'll all be live by the time this
video's up because we're under embargo
so you're seeing it in the future for me
and again just hand onto those purchases
until we review it look at it analyze it
and see if it's actually worth your
money as always we'll give the full look
and all that once we have some in hand

check for the new video we just uploaded
on how to build a grounding cable not
totally related to this content but
pretty fun stuff to know if you're
building computers and working with
