Nexus Don that and we are here with our
fifth installment of green light
spotlight our series that tells you
about up and coming games to watch on
steams greenlight service I am really
excited about the games this week but we
need your help to keep finding more so
nominate games you'd like to see us
support in the comments below that said
this week's number 7 game is what some
might without further inspection call a
minecraft flown and that's because it is
but in a paradeen manner guncraft mocks
the likes of modern warfare battlefield
and notches minecraft with its high
octane slightly ludicrous gameplay the
game itself has fully destructible
everything allows construction map
building within a block based
environment that we're all used to and
even has helicopters and other vehicles
and offers battlefield like gameplay
better yet it has a minecraft map
importer which will allow you to import
existing minecraft maps into guncraft
and then blow your friends to
smithereens in them sounds awesome on a
similar note and similar comedic note
actually folk tale takes slot number six
with its infusion of modern tropes and
classic fantasy and vines this city
building game feels similar to settlers
in design and majesty in humor but aims
to allow room for both more militaristic
play styles and more peaceful city
building focused play styles the game is
multiplayer and allows for full sandbox
play as well so if you like city
builders check out folk tale rounding
out the pack with classic platformer
gameplay is wooden sensei a beautifully
presented time-based challenge game that
was an indicated finalist this year
wooden sensei makes use of grappling
hook movement hammer actuated bounces
and incredibly powerful attacks if I
could say that properly to platform
through the levels the game has varied
environment each with a connected but
different artistic approach and makes
for a game that feels like it really
fits its overarching Japanese theme this
next one's a bit more straightforward
than the previous games gear up takes
slot for and when I saw the video game
play I immediately flash back to playing
battle tanks on the n64 back in the day
gear up supports 32 player tank battles
where each player uses customized tanks
and weapons
gain an edge in engagements Europe has a
full level and challenge editor and it
even has co-op missions and leaderboard
support it is action-packed and focused
on arcade style gameplay from the old
day so give it a look if you want some
tank battles this next one is a quote
unquote military space epic that engages
in space fighting action and has both
planetary battles and space combat
making for something pretty unique it
results in an amalgamation that feels
like it's straight out of popular space
TV series is this dynamic universe
features multiple factions of varying
standings chaotic space battles alien
planetary exploration construction of
colonies and space stations and more it
is effectively a space sim making for an
excellent choice for those who enjoy the
x series of games and other space
simulation games and with that bitterly
0 transition at all we have secrets of
grinding in slot number 2 an old-school
action RPG that combines co-op support
for up to four players and will even add
some classic SNES elements secrets of
grandia implements a zelda inspired
combat system pets skill trees and even
a lengthy well-written story line from
what we have heard the games overall
aesthetic is fluid and appropriate its
combat looks satisfying and the RPG
elements are all in place to make this
play like a classic RPG from the SNES
finally in slot number one after a big
breath we have san fra or st. Freud if
you want to say it like an American it
is a truly cohesive looking game we
first heard of san fra on the developers
of castle story mentioned it in an email
and really the honor was all ours san
fra combines third-person action
elements visceral combat basic trap
placement and defense mechanics and like
and lower all-in-one well-rounded game
in screwed I'm just going to say sane
Freud you must defend your town from
invading werewolves and lycanthropes and
in standing with traditional werewolf
lore they're far more powerful than your
human lumberjack character that's where
the traps come in zip line strategy and
all kinds of other tree traps are
carefully utilized in this game to make
sure that you can survive and your town
and all the werewolves run away crying I
highly recommend looking into san fra as
well as all the other games this week
I'm excited to see where the developers
take them and all of these games need
your support so go to the description
below and click on the steam links and
upload the ones you like that is all for
this week I will see you guys next time
