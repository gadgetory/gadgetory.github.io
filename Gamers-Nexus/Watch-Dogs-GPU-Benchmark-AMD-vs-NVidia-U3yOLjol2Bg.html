Nexus tonight and today we're gonna talk
about the watchdogs at PC benchmarks I
ran a couple of days ago I ran them on
Tuesday when the game came out so we're
just kind of recapping this here for the
YouTube audience for those who are not
in the loop I ran a series of video card
benchmarks and one CPU benchmark with
watchdogs and a PC game that is
reportedly pretty poorly optimized so I
explored that statement here in this in
this article and now we're recapping in
the video so here's here's the setup
I tested watchdogs on these video cards
a gtx 750ti
and AMD 250x those are the two lowest
end ones I tested on a 78 51 gigabyte
card and r9 270x 2 gigabyte card a GTX
770 2 gigabyte card and r9 290x a 4
gigabyte monster card and a 780ti 3
gigabyte monster card finally I added a
4770k to the mix for determining if
there is in fact a CPU throttle or
bottleneck and other than that one CPU I
used a 35 70 K from the Ivy Bridge line
up for all tests so the only test we're
4770k was featured was with a 780ti and
I did test this internally with other
devices but did not publish the results
because they were all frankly the same
they were all very uninteresting so
here's here's what we know
first of all watchdogs have I been
saying titanfall I feel like I've been
saying whoa titanfall watchdogs is a
very intensive game in terms of visuals
but it doesn't necessarily look in a way
that is corresponding to the frame rate
so there's a big framerate hit it just
it's not it's not this generations
crisis that's all there is to it it
looks good it doesn't look GPU mouthing
good but there are optimization issues
and it's on the software side AMD and
NVIDIA have both put out drivers that
helped a lot in this regard with AMD my
testing determined up to 10.5 percent
better with 14.6 catalyst over 14.4 they
claimed 25% I believe that's only with
the 290x and crossfire
10.5% within video there's pretty big
gain also and in some cases the drivers
are required to even make the game
playable without blue screen of death so
even with these drivers and graphics
optimizations by the GPU manufacturers
we still have serious FPS issues and let
me show you let me show you what I mean
the 780ti is a $720 video card it is a
monster when I coupled this with the
4770k which is a 300 to $330 CPU and I
used this on an internal z97 platform
just for the record it was only at 53
FPS average when using ultra settings
and max settings when I benchmarked with
the PC so keep in mind this is a setup
that would cost most users 1,500 to
2,000 dollars to get working and it's
running 53 FPS with max settings that
should never happen with a game that
looks like watchdogs again looks good
not amazing
so why is that happening right that's
the question why is this running so
poorly well if we look at my GPU
optimization guide or rather my
watchdogs optimization guide since the
GPUs are pretty good on their own we'll
see that things like anti-aliasing have
horrible effect on the game and don't
necessarily produce a lot of visual
fidelity in terms of quality of visuals
so disabling MSAA 4x + or or dropping it
down to temporal SMI a which is sort of
a cheat anti-aliasing that I wrote about
previously doing those things drop into
temporal SMI a will nearly double the
framerate it's like it goes from 53 FPS
average to 90 with a 780ti so that's the
first thing you need to know so
disabling or minimizing AAA will improve
your framerate but still ultra high
medium texture resolutions doesn't
matter what you use or how much ram your
video card has I had almost the same
performance when I kept all other
settings identical except for texture
resolution and that's kind of strange it
doesn't normally happen it happened a
little bit in titanfall but that was
because the text resolution didn't
actually impact visuals all that much
not until you got too low so another
issue we have
with watch dogs is optimization as you
decrease the settings I didn't only run
these tests on ultra as you've seen thus
far I also ran them on medium and on
high and the purpose of that was just to
see how the lower end video cards
performed in those scenarios since it's
not quite fair otherwise so so looking
at medium the 780ti a 700 plus dollar
video card with the 35 70k overclocked
to 4.4 gigahertz and 16 gigabytes of
very fast RAM we got 100 FPS and that
was testing with temporal SMA AAA that's
not with MSA a 4x or whatever its
temporal SMA a which is the lower
setting that has produced higher FPS
results you'll notice that this is
within the same realm when I said that
playing on ultra with temporal SMA a
with a 780ti produces about a 90 FPS so
where 10 FPS faster by going to medium
that tells us what it tells us that
almost all the performance gain is in
the AAA so something with anti-aliasing
is horribly unwise in watch dogs to the
point where you should not even be using
it and actually I was speaking with with
gadget from the build a PC Reddit and
other edits and he has a 778 70 AMD GPU
that has severe stuttering issues with
certain types of anti-aliasing I was
able to reproduce that finally after
much effort on my to 70 guys you'll also
notice that the GTX 770 program is about
85 FPS average on medium and then let's
just skip a few of these going down to
the 7850 is + + 250 X's of the world is
where we start hitting the 50 and lower
FPS range so that's when you start
getting into unplayable territory on
medium and need to drop to low so that's
our our benchmark I'll throw up the the
high one here again just so you can kind
of read through that as I'm talking and
the conclusion here first of all I want
to make it very clear I am not yet
commenting on whether watchdogs is a
good game because I don't feel confident
that I've played it enough from a
gameplay stay and play standpoint to
make that statement but strictly from a
hardware perspective if you are set on
playing this game
and you're gonna build the system around
it or your speck in your system around
it or you're trying to make sure you can
even run it before you buy it what you
should know is that the 750ti
hands down has the most impressive
performance here everything else is sort
of once you scale above that you're
getting diminishing returns and once you
go below that it's completely unplayable
so with a 750ti with medium settings and
temporal SMA I was able to produce
nearly 60fps it was about 54 FPS on
average with a 35 70 K and and then
other than that everything's pretty
normalized and uninteresting so that
would be the card to get it's 150 bucks
that would be the card to get if you're
building around this game because it
plays it well it produces a very smooth
framelit frame rate excuse me I didn't
have any frame drops like I did with
some of the other cards even the 780ti
had frame trapping issues it's kind of
actually frankly outrageous but that
that is the card I would look at beyond
that you don't need to worry about CPUs
almost at all because when we look
between the 4770k and the 35 70 K which
is a $100 difference and a one
generation difference we see a half an
FPS improvement which is within margin
of error that's not even something that
should be considered so for all intents
and purposes that the two CPUs are
identical the i7 on the i-5 are
identical in performance for watchdogs
so that's sort of the need-to-know
information please check the link in the
description below for the full article I
will also link my new guide it's also a
video guide on the channel for how to
tweak a configuration file to improve
watchdogs performance and that should
hopefully help mitigate some of the FPS
issues we're talking about here I've
sort of determined that a lot of those
manual tweaks will improve your overall
performance and hopefully eliminate some
of the crashing issues that have run
rampant in the game for some users with
some specific subsets of hardware please
like comment and subscribe as always if
you have any questions whatsoever leave
them on the article linked below or on
this video I will do my very best to
answer them if I do not answer
hit me again on the
in the article and I will see you all
next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
