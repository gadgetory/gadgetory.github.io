coming to the end of our coverage here
at the show today we're looking at two
new peripherals from hyperx including
the keyboard here the FPS alloy and the
headset which is the new hyperx stainer
before getting to these this content is
brought to you by i buy power and the
new element in gaming PC with a full
tempered glass side window tempered
glass in the front and LEDs everywhere
so let's start with a headset hyperx has
been doing headsets for a couple years
now they start with the cloud one which
actually we still use and then the cloud
to obviously after the Hat numerically
there was a revolver that we saw at CES
previously didn't really talk about it
too much after that this is the new one
this is the stainer so the Stinger comes
in a bit cheaper than the previous
headsets is a fifty dollar unit it has
the movable ear cups so you can rest it
on your shoulders if you wanted to fully
fold them down like that and then for
the microphone the only real difference
here is that it is fixed to the headset
to the earcup whereas previously was
detachable and now there is a mute so
there's a mic mute once it hits a
certain point you'll see that I'm
starting to reach some resistance there
in the push and that's because once it
hits a certain point in pushing the
microphone up it will actually just mute
so that's we've seen that functionality
before but it is on a cheaper headset
now at fifty dollars for these thinner
in terms of hard specs it's got 50
millimeter drivers down from the 53
millimeters previously nothing too
special to say about them other than 50
millimeter drivers and the one
interesting aspect of those is that
they're actually at a slight angle in
the ear cup which you'll see in our b
roll and that's because the angle helps
add effectively some extra dimensions to
the inside of the cop so you got some
extra base so from the more tactical
side that's just an interesting
engineering standpoint where you can put
it out an angle and get that extra base
there for the keyboard the FPS alloy
this is one that's also fairly simple
but is the first keyboard from hyperx
there's a 100-dollar model about fifty
and a hundred dollars for the price
points the keyboard FPS alloy is named
as such because
it is an alloy or aluminum shell at
least part of it is anyway plastic for
the rest I don't know what the back
plate is right now it is fairly rigid
just from basic testing here at the
booth but I don't know if it's a metal
or plastic back late for the switches
you pull a switch off you'll see that it
is using standard cherry MX blue
switches and these are the same as every
other MX blue you'll find so if you like
I'm excludes then you'll like these as
one would expect the keyboard for
functionality features all that stuff it
does obviously have red LED lighting
backlighting and you can use function
keys with the arrow keys here we have
beer all of that as well to adjust the
brightness of the light and adjust a bit
different modes so there's wave mode
there's the sort of breathing effect
there's the one where you when you type
it leaves the lights behind so those are
different modes you turn them off
completely if you don't like lights and
then this is a detachable USB cable so
very easy to just unplug and that's just
a micro USB or mini USB cable and it is
graded bottom side just plastic you've
got the two feet of course as one would
also expect there's only one adjustment
for the angle and that's really it for
the keyboard other than I suppose we
could mention these key caps over here
for the WASD 1234 those are included but
you could also use black if you prefer
the matte black finish there's no
software this with this keyboard so if
you're used to having something like LG
s q a million other software solutions
there's not one for this that is
potentially selling point depending on
how you feel about those but that's
pretty much it for this the basic specs
of these will have more information
linked in the description below in the
article if you want to read more about
the additional specifics we've received
at the booth otherwise reviews in the
future and we'll let you know how they
perform in the lab so thank you for
