recap
despite the upcoming massive launch week
there's still a lot of news to talk
about for example one of the news items
sees Intel using the words secret sauce
which is disgusting in 100% of these
sentences you could use the phrase in
Intel also recognizes Andy as quote
formidable that's from an Intel internal
document and we'll be talking about that
today it is a very long document but
we've got just a page of it here to talk
about Huawei and Microsoft's support and
updates to talk about in that ongoing
story about - dropping 32-bit support
bringing it back Intel supporting an
integer scaling and some AMD news as
well before that this video is brought
to you by the EVGA gtx 1660 XC black
video card EVGA is gtx 1660 XC black
uses a fat heatsink to allow the card to
run at lower noise levels for longer
capable of sinking more heat before the
fan kicks in and also has a day one game
ready drivers for game launches the 1660
XC black is short and compact for
installations a small form-factor pc
build but if you need one that isn't
extra thick it's also accompanied by a
dual fan counterpart with a thinner
heatsink for standard dual slot support
learn more at the links in the
description below so first up the
toolkit launch from last week has gone
over very well thank you for your
tremendous support on it we still have
them on store documents nexus dotnet we
bought a lot of inventory this time
because one moq is high for this and
economies of scale are never in your
favor as a small company but we were
able to pull together a really awesome
tool kit so store like every seconds net
if you want to check it out it has been
very popular so far thank you for the
support as I said Intel recognizing AMD
as resurgent in the CPU space especially
pointing out its capacity to compete in
servers which Intel says will be the
most heated market segment that it has
embattled AMD in for a while and it'll
be the most heated the server segment
has been in years which is really not a
surprise to anybody following the space
so an internal Intel document has leaked
onto reddit that outlines the
competitive profile of AMD and this is
all according to Intel the letter title
quote anticompetitive profile where we
go toe to toe why they are resurgent
which chips of ours beat theirs analyzes
and these rise to competitiveness with
no shortage of Intel bias and as a quick
aside whoever titled that document don't
get into YouTube you'll you'll be bad at
it it is the most important thing about
a YouTube video so however the letter
does say that andis competitive threat
to Intel is acknowledged as the quote
greatest it has been in years
again that's accurate factually the
letter does go on to look at AMD's
growth its success with Rison and its
newfound surge on the stock market the
letter also defines key competitive
threats from Andy's upcoming seven enemy
to Rome and these continued push into
winning over cloud providers and the
value of offering its HPC high-end parts
to the HPC market Intel also recognizes
the advantage of Andy partnering with
the leading tsmc foundry and having am
these chips on an advanced note the
answer to all of this according to Intel
is its secret sauce which is probably
the same stuff they put in BO sauce so
Intel says that it's got some pillars
something that AMD softened done as well
everyone's got their pillars in Silicon
Valley Intel says its pillars will be
the secret answer to Andy and it defines
them as following process architecture
memory interconnect security and
software and these are the six pillars
that Intel says will coalesce to form
its secret sauce to stave off AMD
security being the noteworthy one Intel
noted that quote AMD offers
high-performance CPUs posing direct
competition to Intel in both our core
clients and data center CPU businesses
with our announced ambitions to bring
new discrete graphics to market we are
bringing new competition to both AMD's
and and videos graphics businesses and
the company further stated quote Andy
has recently been gaining some traction
and winning public cloud offerings and
competition from AMD is shaping up to be
especially tough in high-performance
computing HPC performance is usually
driven by a number of cores and the
number of memory channels or memory
with intel is challenged on both fronts
and this is something that we actually
to step back from this story a little
bit we talked with Gordon at Computex
from PC worlds Gordon Myon from PC world
and talked with him about is Intel
screwed that was the question a lot of
commentators had said it around Computex
time when the announcements were
happening
and so we wanted to address it spend a
half an hour doing so what we did not
expect was for Intel to try and answer
that question I mean of course they have
competitive analysts and this as an
aside may be interesting to you more
interesting less surprising Intel does
apparently employ someone whose entire
job is to be the AMD competitive analyst
the expert at Intel so this isn't really
news every major company has competitive
analysts we had them at Dell when I
worked there but you know I don't really
hear about them as a consumer it's it's
not a public-facing so in tiles
competitive analysts did not paint a
good picture and his replies the
internal QA that Intel did are pretty
honest I guess the interesting thing
though is that there's there's a lot of
talk always in the consumer space of is
Intel in trouble or is AMD in trouble or
whatever and it's kind of like people
like watching this boxing match of these
giant companies beating each other
bloody to steal Gordon's quote when
Nvidia took it for RTX the difference I
guess this time is that it feels more
real like it feels like there's some
urgency to the situation from Intel's
end especially reading this document
which you can do to its online and
normally you don't really get that
feeling normally especially in a
position of media you become kind of
jaded to the people talking about
company a is in trouble because guess
what next quarter company B might be in
trouble
and it's just a back and forth that
seems perpetual so yeah this this is
quite a bit different but the secret
sauce was criticized by an Intel
employee who commented on the internal
memo saying the following the quote
secret sauce section of this article
personally makes me cringe
there isn't one piece of evidence that
makes me hopeful for Intel in the short
term when it comes to competing vs. AMD
no numeric said
all except for how big our former
software and services group is having
more software engineers than AMD not
convincing technology portfolio not
convincing especially given that AMD has
much more graphics and gaming technology
expertise a IDL expertise it's pretty
clear that we are following in this
regard as well Andy is on fire
especially given its size they
continually squeak out new products with
fewer people and have leapfrog to our
hardware several times in the past they
have a competitive product with far more
cores and threads which is a huge
marketing ploy and has been what our
customers have been asking for there's
no excuse for why we didn't do the same
and now we're in a race to catch up at a
time where we are hemorrhaging talent
while also feeling the consequences of
the past five to eight years of
management decisions in the way we
manage our CPU teams and the priorities
of that management so again that's an
internal comment from someone who works
at Intel and I don't believe the the
full names of these people were shared
in that thread and hopefully that will
remain true because it's internal it's
not meant to be out there and they're
speaking their minds which is good for
Intel hopefully it's one listen so
anyway while there's no new exciting
announcements within the letter it does
provide some insight to how Intel is
surveying the situation with a and these
resurgence and how the company plans to
deal with the challenges that it hasn't
had to face or that it hasn't faced in
years and that'll wrap that one but
we'll link the article in our show notes
below if you would like to read the full
Intel memo as a quick aside too we
wanted to give a shout out this week to
e postbox on youtube so e burrows fox
post streaming focused content and he
did a follow-up to our streaming look
for HT 6 for streaming quality and did a
phenomenal job of testing just about
everything so when way off the deep end
with it and for people who might have
had questions about for example
faster-paced footage that was a common
request or criticism of our content and
a valid one for people who want to see
that go check out a postboxes video he
talked about that he confirms a lot of
our findings and then he also has some
some new findings a lot of them actually
and he also has a lot of additional day
like psnr for example so definitely
check him out will link his video in the
description below and it's 30 minutes so
I it's about the length that everyone on
this channel should expect at this point
so you should be good on that one watch
the whole thing well worth it for a
quality comparison for streaming just
wanted to point that out separately
because it's it's good work Intel
Microsoft will support hallway with
security updates for now and the ongoing
story talking about the blacklist for
huawei by the US government while always
future is uncertain in the Western
Hemisphere after the US government's
trade blacklist at least Intel Microsoft
have confirmed they will continue to
support the companies and its devices
with critical updates quote we remain
committed to providing exceptional
customer experiences our initial
evaluation of the US Department of
Commerce's decision on Huawei has
indicated we may continue to offer
Microsoft software updates to customers
with Huawei devices Microsoft said two
PC world PC world also stated that it
has received confirmation from Intel
that the chip maker would continue to
support Huawei and its devices or Intel
based ones anyway the news should at
least partly its wage any concerned
consumer who may be in possession of one
of huawei's laptops or other devices and
this is something we'll continue to
follow going forward canonical announced
recently that they would be dropping
32-bit support beginning with Ubuntu
1910 meaning anything that relies on
32-bit libraries or binaries would
likely be broken valve evidently seen
the writing on the wall for Ubuntu and
turn announced it would be dropping
official support for future avanti
releases and would cease to recommend it
as well as shifting focus to a new
distribution the set Linux gamers and
developers into an uproar and now
canonical has walked that decision back
quote thanks to the huge amount of
feedback this weekend from gamers Ubuntu
studio and the wine community we will
change our plan and build selected
32-bit I 386 packages for Ubuntu 1910
and 2004 LTS stated in a blog post so at
least in the near term 32-bit Ubuntu
will survive and I'm sorry if you say it
a different way I truly am but that is
how that is how I've said it for about
10 years so it's not changing it
this point AMD recruits Frank Azer from
Dell Frank Azer was almost my boss at
one point when I was applying for
positions at Alienware and Dell back in
the day before really doing this full
time and it up at Dell though at a
different team but AMD has purportedly
recruited Alienware co-founder Frank
azer who is rumored to assume the mantle
of chief gaming officer at AMD Heiser
has been with talented absorbed
Alienware back in 2006 and most recently
he served as a vice president and
general manager for dell brands such as
Alienware XPS and the G Series and
separately
Gordon MA on executive editor at PC
world and men shouting that clouds
outside the tweeted at pre-k has her
accidentally to try and ask if it was
official but anyway check Gordon out on
Twitter he's awesome and you should
definitely follow him he does shout at
the sky sometimes but that's a different
thing so little is known about what
exactly Frank will be doing or Asia will
be doing that AMD but we can't assume it
will be related to helping and the
further extent its ability to target the
gaming market and enthusiasts segments
and the slowly gaining ground in the
gaming notebooks Edwin it took a long
time but it's happening and this is one
that has all but shut AMD out up until
recently so that'll be news to follow in
a post on the Alienware site as I
mentioned his last day at Dell will be a
July 3rd Intel to support two integer
scaling Intel's
lease appears confirmed via Twitter that
Intel will support engineer scaling and
upscaling technique with its Gen 11
graphics and future Intel XE graphics
cards Pierce noted that the patch would
roll out in August to the Intel graphics
command center that will enable integer
scaling support and so continues to take
a community centric approach for its
graphics ambitions and integer scaling
support should certainly resonate well
with its users and the Nvidia have been
petitioned to add this feature but to
date they only employ bilinear or
bicubic interpolation of scaling
techniques well companies like AMD Intel
and arm are no doubt
lamenting the trade war with China which
has culminated it in a trade ban
against Huawei there's at least one chip
maker that sees this as an opportunity
and it's sy5 which recently as an aside
acquired one of the former and the
marketing talents it's a chip start-up
and it's based in California designs
chips based on the open source Ras CV
architecture and plans to help Chinese
tech companies between themselves off of
us-based technology quote we are going
to expand big-time in China the trade
war has helped us a lot because it
convinced China to do more chips inside
the country and we are helping them do
so so I 5 president and CEO Naveed irani
said it became clear to us about three
or four years ago that a trade war was
going to happen and the action we took
is building a completely independent
company in China the restrictions of the
u.s. entity list do not apply the open
source technology and sci-fi have
intentionally set up an independent
China based branch under the name
Shanghai siphon technology company
according to Nikkei Asian review site 5
is currently baking a 5g mobile chip
based on wrist v and it currently has
over 100 licenses for his risk V chip
designs some of Syfy's customers include
Qualcomm and SK Hynix
furthermore the companies backed by
Intel Samsung and Western Digital
shravani has stated that sci-fi is
current risk ve chips are approaching
arm the eight performance parity and
within a year they could ellipse arm v8
some display technology news for people
who are display enthusiasts visa has
announced that it's DisplayPort 2.0
specification is coming up and the first
supported products are coming in late
2020 visa announced it's DisplayPort 2.0
specification and it may be the biggest
revision that the standard has ever
received in terms of raw bandwidth
DisplayPort 2.0 is preparing for 8 K and
Beyond by almost tripling the available
bandwidth over the previous 1.3 1.4
specs DisplayPort 2.0 is targeting a
data rate of 80 gigabits per second or
20 gigabits per second per Lane this
means that DP 2.0 will support 8k at 60
Hertz or I'll also allowing for 30 bit
color depth they said lists some
potential display configurations that DP
2.0 could enable as the following single
display resolutions
the company says could include 116 K
which is fifteen thousand three hundred
sixty by eighty four sixty pixels
display at 60 Hertz and thirty BVP four
by four by four and 110 cake display as
well with a 24bpp and no compression
dual display resolutions are also in the
list to 8k for example to 4k different
levels of compression triple display
resolutions included 10k by three or
three 4k monitors the standard 4k that
we all know at ninety Hertz and then
when using only two lanes on the USBC
connector via DP alt mode it allows for
simultaneous super speed USB data and
video DP 2.0 can enable such
configurations as three 4k at 144 Hertz
two 4k by 4k displays or 4096 4096 for
AR VR headsets at 120 Hertz and a3q HD
or 1440p displays at 120 Hertz one 8k
display at 30 Hertz also listed DB 2.0
will use the native DP connector as well
as USB type-c to incorporate Intel's
Thunderbolt 3 for the physical layer
that also means that DP 2.0 will inherit
the acts of Caitlin versus passive
cabling conundrum and as an intact notes
visa hasn't fully addressed that issue
but instead is focusing on what can be
achieved with passive cables for the
near term and we'd recommend checking
out their article for more depth on this
write-up they saw also has something
published on its website bases org basic
expects DP 2.0 to service in retail
products by late 2020 and will go
head-to-head with the competing HDMI 2.1
standard and finally it seems
Coolermaster is set to enter the gaming
monitor market this is actually a market
where you're gonna see a lot of
companies increasing their presence in
it like msi for example gigabyte for
example because there's a lot of growth
potential in the monitor market
especially what the changes coming up so
it seems that Coolermaster wants to join
the likes of a messiah and gigabyte at
all and is working on its own models two
of them are coming up and they are
called check GM a 2-1 9 - 3 0 and GM 2 +
9 - 3 5 so we
we haven't fixed the naming problem and
monitors if we've not addressed that
issue yet as is the case with most
monitor model names the numbers tell the
tale the GM - 19 - 30 will be a 30 inch
display with a 21 by 9 aspect ratio so
admittedly it's actually not that bad
compared to the other names while the GM
- 19 - 35 sports a 35 inch screen once
you understand the naming scheme it's
not too bad both will be based on a
curved VA panel the GM - 1930 will offer
a resolution of 2560 by 1080 at 200
Hertz while the GM - 1935
will run at 34 40 by 1440 at 120 Hertz
both panels are expected to offer a 1
millisecond response time prices are
currently rumored but the rumours are
$400 for the - 1930 and $1,000 for the
to 1935 release dates are expected
toward end of 2019 so that will cover it
for this one thank you for watching as
always you can subscribe for more and
you should because we have a lot of
reviews coming up this is the busiest
week of our professional career here
ever I think because it's about 8 CPUs
on the same day - GPUs on the same day -
other GPUs at least and that's a lot of
stuff to review so there's a lot coming
up and you should be subscribed go to
store now Cameron's axis net to pick up
at our new tool kit if you would like to
pay for our caffeine for the week or you
can go to patreon.com/scishow there's
access where we are posting another
