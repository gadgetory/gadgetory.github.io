Thermaltake at CES 2019 it's kind of a
room it has a couple of curtains in it
and this is where they've hidden the
airflow so he's seen our coverage for I
don't know Corsair for example or even
the fans XP 600 unless you remove that
front panel pretty limited airflow cases
thermaltake felt felt so alone in having
a case with a mesh front on it that they
hid it in the side room and we we happen
to find it before that this video is
brought to you by the gigabyte zee 390
ARS master motherboard which comes
equipped with one of the more powerful
z3 90 V RMS for heavier overclocks on
the new 9th gen Intel CPUs the ARS
Master is also one of the few
motherboards with a real heatsink this
generation featuring a mix of high
surface area fins and looks oriented
cover blocks oh and it's also got
updated RDV illumination learn more at
the link below so what we have here is
the thermal take Commander series cases
C 31 2 C 36 there's a couple things that
could be done better couple things that
are actually pretty competitive so we're
gonna run through these because there's
been a distinct lack of holes in the
front of a case for this show also quick
note Thermaltake has some new water ramp
which will show at the end or end of the
video talk about that a bit that is in
fact the name of it is called water RAM
but more on that in a second so the case
the case series here is C 31 through C
36 32 33 34 so forth and a couple of
different front panels the tooling
itself is the same on all of them the
chassis structurally is the same it's
just the paneling changes on the front
the reason this is kind of interesting
is a price point hundred ten dollars to
the black version hundred twenty for the
white version and it comes with two a
RGB fans that are 200 millimeters now
like I said a couple things like could
be improved I'll walk through those
momentarily but strictly from a
standpoint of competition on the market
nearby case it would be the cooler
master H 500 blank just H 500 extremely
competitive case we liked it in our
testing originally and a hundred bucks
it's it's one of the best you can get at
that price point so thermal takes
cutting it pretty close to the cooler
master H 500 which is good because other
nearby cases would be like $70 $80 H 500
NZXT
case our l06 things like that so this is
a more or less a direct competitor to
the H 500 the problem is just that some
of the the looks aren't fully well it's
not fully competitive there but in
cooling it should be interesting to look
at so - 200 millimeter fans in the front
one fan in the back that's going to be
just a black fan no a RGB on that one
and then for the rest it's going to vary
by panel the back fan will be a 120
millimeter and we don't have rpm specs
or anything like that but other
information for the case is I mean I
guess that's more or less it there's a
button to change the LED color will have
some b-roll of that but here's here's
where I would like to see some
improvement a couple of small details
that Thermaltake could step forward with
this is something we talked about with a
500 the level 20 mt thermaltake gets
like the bass idea down pretty well and
this is one of those this is actually
competitive just small things like the
panel the glass panel here isn't really
fully flush with the side something we
talked about with cooler masters aged
500 PV ously the original H 500 P the
door here the the glass could use a
little tab to pull it out cuz right now
to get it out you kind of have to put
your hand on the glass and push it and
that's just it's glass you can get
fingerprints everywhere so that could
use an improvement I don't think these
are a hundred percent final so some of
that stuff could change another small
one the dust filter the mesh for the
front panels is a it's a foam which is
fine but it's not removable really it's
got maybe like 12 tabs on it and the
problem with having a bunch of tabs is
that you can only bend them so many
times before they break permanently and
snap and so yeah I mean it could use a
better dust filter but from the point of
the pricing performance fan count stuff
like that fan size highly competitive
it'll come down to review stats and then
of course your own preferences if you
feel like this case beats the age 500
from Coolermaster insofar as looks and
will test the thermals for you in the
noise and look at that later so let us
know what you think versus the other
cases similar to this on the market
there really weren't many airflow cases
this year coarser disappointed us in a
significant way fan Tex is looking
pretty good on the metallic gear case
the Neo air looks very compelling but
has
few shortcomings as well and then the
p600 ass pretty popular case much more
expensive than this different price
category and it's just well unless you
pull the front out of the case it's not
an airflow case it's just it just isn't
but it could be competitive when you do
that so they're all take has done well
to make an airflow case and bring it
here it just it needs to get a little
further so hopefully we'll see that but
yeah that is the commander CVC 31
through 36 the memory that's here like I
said water RAM is the name there'll be
series names laters but the specs on
that 3,200 CL 16 and then the the I see
is hynek's I don't know which diet is
but it's a Hynix die for the IC and just
one other note here the big question
about that is how is it being marketed
because if it's not being marketed as
cooling that's okay you can go from it
from an aesthetic standpoint this looks
cool if that's the selling point fine if
it's this is cooler and therefore clocks
better then that's wrong but right now
it sounds like they're on take
acknowledges that and they're going they
did not want to toss that it's cooler
they want from an aesthetic standpoint
so that's what we like to hear because
we ran memory at like 1.8 5 volts over
4000 megahertz not long ago and it
didn't get hot didn't have it found it
so you don't need water cooling if you
like how it looks though we have some
b-roll let us know what you think of
that from an aesthetic standpoint and I
guess from a logistic standpoint of
managing your tubing because we're
curious to see what kind of the market
interested isn't that we low volume to
start though so that's it the Commander
series case is from Thermaltake do look
actually very promising hopefully we see
some continued improvements and
iterations on this base design and
cooler master a thermal take no longer
feels ashamed from the their airflow
ways with this and can bring them out
into the main showroom because they're
actually pretty cool cases so $100 110
120 dollars for these with the white
version cost and more thank you for
