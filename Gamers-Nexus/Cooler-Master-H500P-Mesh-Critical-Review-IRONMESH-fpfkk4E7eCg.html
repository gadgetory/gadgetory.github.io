cable mod pro series cable mods new pro
cables come with pre-installed closed
combs for clean builds accompanied by a
revamp to color style and vibrance the
cables are now using thicker wires and
they've also added right-angled internal
USB 3 extension and right angled SATA
data cables by the pro series cable kits
at the link below or customize it your
cable set with the configurator also
linked below ok so maybe I didn't
literally make this case but it feels
like our criticisms have been heard by
Coolermaster and a lot of the things
that we wanted to see done on the H 500
P have been done this is the H 500 feet
mesh which is what we're reviewing today
and Coolermaster is making sure that no
one hears about it because if you look
around there's been a time of filming
exactly one media review by US media and
the case is to be found nowhere we
bought ours pre-ordered it same or next
day shipped it and so we were able to
get one but there's not a lot of
coverage out there which is really
strange but the result is exactly what
we wanted to see this case is
significantly improved over the original
aged 500 P and as we go through airflow
which we test it with an anemometer this
time just to make extra certain
everyone's on the same page air flow
testing cooling testing and we'll get
through that stuff but just straight out
the gate I'll tell you it's much better
it still has flaws but it's better and
the oddity here is now that Coolermaster
has managed to at although they might
not admit it take some criticisms to
heart and improve the case but they
didn't send us one which is fine we're
not entitled to it I can spend 150 bucks
it's fine but the thing I don't get is
it just screams like either a lack of
confidence or like like some sort of
something's going on there politically
that doesn't make a lot of sense because
if your most critical reviewer is
silenced by your improvements that seems
like a good thing so anyway the weird
thing is there's been basically one
review and it's sad now because no one's
hearing about the tremendous
improvements they've made they
500 view mesh so we're gonna tell you
about them because a cooler mastered
some reason is not telling you about
them a couple things let's go over the
basics again just to get everyone up to
speed so our chief criticisms of this
case the many times over that we have
criticized it we're one that it falls
apart this one has resolved that I just
kind of you know I'm gonna I'm gonna
lift it from the top here because if you
look from the top it would fall apart
but even when I'm really trying to rip
that panel off it's still on there so
they've done well that's just a clip on
the front now the top will not know okay
maybe you apply a lot of force it'll
kind of budge but it's not going to come
off and that's cuz there's a screw dead
center in the back which there was not
one before so if you pull the screw off
you can get the top off of the case but
up until that point it's stuck on there
this used to wobble and now it doesn't
yeah they've improved that they've here
the front they prove the top the power
supply now mounts to it's just a shell
that inserts just like with an s3 40 or
a lot of the other cases on the market
so you no longer have to take the entire
friggin power supply route out to put
the power supply in the case that's a
great change and you could still take
the PSU strata if you wanted to but it's
not really a need to anymore unless you
just want to improve the GPU cooling
performance on the front of GPU cooling
performance you may have noticed that
the front has mesh in it but they've got
a really super fine dust filter behind
it in the past with the thermal take g21
and some other cases we've seen
instances where you put one of these in
the front panel and then you put another
filter in front of it you can choke so
much air out of the case that it's as
much as an 8 to 10 degree increase than
just removing those filters and leaving
a flat mesh on the front instead or one
single dust filter so that's something
we looked into and will talk about in a
bit we have a shot of this where if you
hold up to light you can actually see
that it's got some clear like
crystallized stuff in between some of
the holes that's because they spray
adhesive to mount the filter to the
front of the mesh front panel and so
that gets into the air filters holes but
it's not really a big deal because only
a couple of them are blocked off as
you'll see in our footage
and it actually performs okay as we'll
go over in a moment so those are all the
big changes basically the mesh is the
biggest one and again we took an atom
out or stuck it in there and tested
airflow in a couple different scenarios
so that's that's the exterior stuff we
think that covers pretty much all of the
exterior really quickly obvious it's a
white case mixing white on metal with
plastic is something that corsair
recently had trouble with it with the
275 R and NZXT in the very distant past
has had trouble with though they've
solved that Coolermaster right away
they've done it pretty well the white is
more or less a pure white color and it
matches on all panels so they've done
well with that too internally let's
let's take the panel off and check out
what it looks like inside a got-damn
okay so panels aren't perfect they still
have this problem but the thing that
kind of sucks is on the inside there's
only one clip so you rotate this in
increments of quarter turns and
eventually every one and four you'll get
this to a line with the top and it'll
lock so right now you know if you kind
of not paint you took the panel off an
hour ago you messed with your system
you're putting it back on you've
forgotten where the inside thing is so
if you rotate it that way it will be
pointed down or whatever so that could
be improved it's really not a big deal
it's kind of annoying it's a mild
irritation and it's something that they
could very easily improve which is the
only reason I mentioned in it this is
the cable management bar which is a bit
of a trend in the industry so they
tagged along to that trend we don't find
this particularly useful it's not really
fat enough to contain the cables
reasonably for our configuration and
more importantly we'd really like to see
some improvements made to this as well
so this is the outside this face is to
the left to my left and on the inside
we'd like to see they're actually on
either side we'd like to see some cable
tie points so we'd like to see that
improved but again pretty minor complete
compared to last time where the video
literally opened up was the case falling
apart in my hat
so it's massively improved to go over a
couple of other important points we've
seen some commentary online on the only
review that's out there
that's a little bit misguided so the top
panel is not mesh it's still the acrylic
top someone comments we've seen online
I've been like WTF Coolermaster wasted
their time it's not mesh on the top no
that's not exactly how it works so
depending on your configuration there's
two ways to look at this and one
configuration with tower cooler like we
have here with our test bench what we
found when we made our own mesh version
of the age 500 P like months before this
launched probably six months before this
launched or more when we made our own
mesh if I'd aged 500 P what we found was
that putting mesh in the top and the
front was actually worse than putting
mesh just in the front the reason for
that is because of the pressure change
it's a really simple pressure air
pressure system we're talking out here
with mesh in the front and acrylic in
the top what you have and no top fans
just a rear fan and two front fans what
you have is a pressure system that is
positive and so air comes in through the
front and it's going to feed basically
straight into the CPU cooler now there's
acrylic on the top in a positive
pressure system air will escape anywhere
there is a crack for it to escape this
is why positive pressure is well-liked
because theoretically it helps with das
management that's neither here nor there
so in theory with a mesh panel on the
top and this is something we proved it's
not just theory but the theory would be
mesh on the top positive pressure
without any fans on the top what you
have is air that will escape through the
top before it ever gets to the CPU
cooler so the CPU cooler ends up
recirculating a bunch of the warmer air
that has come out of the GPU below it
which is an open face card so cooler
master actually has done what we think
is the correct thing to do which is have
the acrylic top because that improves
the air pressure dynamic in a way that
the air goes straight into the CPU
cooler into the GPU your thermals are
better overall than with a mesh top a
mesh top would be better in one primary
scenario that's if you have a radiator
if you mount a radiator in the top of
this thing it's really gonna suck
because or actually it'll do the inverse
it it won't do anything really because
if you put on the top the AIRC hands
exhaust through the top panel it can
only go
through these slats on the side and
that's not a lot of space there the back
has zero ventilation and it should have
a mesh hole there as well if they really
want the acrylic on the top so what
they've done here is optimized for an
air cooled system liquid cooling yes it
will work no it will not be optimal so
you pick the one that you want I think
when I spoke to coolermaster months and
months ago when they would still talk to
me I think they were planning on doing
optional modular mesh panels so if that
still goes through you could buy one for
the top but I don't know anymore because
Coolermaster doesn't want anything to do
with us because we criticize the hell
out of the first case so let's get
through some of the numbers here and
then we'll we'll wrap it up and see how
this thing does overall before we get
into the test data this is the list of
components that we use for our
standardized case testing so this is our
case test bench sponsored by cable mod
you can find a link to their cables in
this bench in the article below and
finally full testing methodology in the
article below if you have any questions
about how we did this we tested a few
primary configurations for thermal and
air flow benchmarking the test
configurations included a stock test a
stock test with the primary dust filter
meticulously removed a test with the
entire front panel removed and a
vertical GPU test these mirrors the
tests that we ran on the original H 500
B enclosure though we did eliminate some
of the bonus tests that we ran on the
original case
one such eliminated test was the
internally fixed 140 millimeter fans
which we were using to determine whether
a static pressure limitation inhibited
the original case now with a mesh front
panel and under focus that buyers of
this case primarily want those 200
millimeter fans we are entirely driving
efforts toward validating the stock 200
millimeter fan performance we're
starting with an airflow test this
testing uses a high-end anemometer that
has been placed in a fixed position
behind the top front intake fan all
panels are closed during the test with a
small crack in the top panel for the
anemometer hot wire cable to pass
through this test will give us an
airspeed measurement to determine
objectively without any thermal testing
required how well the various panel
configurations perform
our thermals should follow these numbers
in a non linear but relatively evenly
scaled fashion testing is with fans at
max speed and with a GPU fan off with a
stock configuration of the cooler master
H 500 P mesh we measured airflow at 368
linear feet per minute averaged over the
test period this is a stark contrast to
cooler masters original age 500 PE
replacing the H 500 P mesh front panel
with the original page 500 people and
changing nothing else
we measured 137 linear feet per minute
of air flow with the old case front
panel which by the way fits perfectly on
the aged 500 P mesh removing the panel
entirely shows us the maximum airflow
given our point of measurement and the
fans included we're at four seventy
seven point five L p.m. for that with a
mesh only measurement at four seventy
four point six al p.m. note that the LP
M measurements are highly volatile these
will depend heavily on where you measure
against the fan because they are
relative four hours they can be compared
against each other if other outlets or
if you attempted to do anemometer
readings of your own they would likely
differ due to one barometric pressure
and other things local to our
environment and to testing in different
locations against the fan with different
tools can be highly variable so just to
be clear here because we don't do a lot
of animal door stuff unless it's that
knock to a fan investigation we did when
you take something like a hot wire
anemometer if you hold it up against a
fan here versus here we're just here
versus here anywhere on the fan it's
going to be a different measurement
sometimes drastically so because the
fans ultimately have different zones
where more air will get through or less
air will get through depending on how
close you are to the outer edge versus
how close you are to the hub the hub
being a giant dead zone behind it so
that matters a lot for our testing we
know where to place them we've talked
about it in our NOC 2a coverage and we
keep it exactly in the same spot fixed
basically taped to the location so it
does not move during the testing but
what we see here is a massive difference
because you can take the old panel and
throw it onto this case and what you
find is that the airflow at 1:30
something LPM versus 360 or so on the
other is is quite different so that's a
significant change and that change is
because of the acrylic on this one and
actually while I'm holding this now
we're gonna deviate for one second from
the thermals and go a bit off-track and
let me just remind you of this
the wobbliness of the original case and
I actually used to Creek a lot too
before we fixed it by taping everything
down so that creaking and the wobbliness
and the cheap McDonald soy plastic as I
called it in the original review these
we're all problems that were faced with
a new panel because they added a
crossbar here that adds structural
support all sorts needed to push the
mesh out anyway but let's get back on
topic and go through the thermals now
for the first thermal chart we're
looking only at the Coolermaster half
series products for CPU torture thermals
the original Coolermaster h 500 p under
stock configuration measured at 56
degrees celsius over ambience one of the
worst marks on this chart are actually
the worst and it's about five degrees
warmer than the half x from 2010 the age
500 p mesh stock operated about 48
degrees over ambient for the cpu and
improvement of approximately 8 degrees
celsius this is in line with our own
observed 8 degrees Celsius improvement
from our DIY mesh h 500px four months
ago and nearly perfectly follows that
old data removing the dust filter from
the H 500 feet match resulted in a 46
degree measurement and improvement of
only 2 degrees Celsius just outside of
margin of error cooler masters dust
filter does not significantly impede air
flow and we'd recommend leaving it in
proving that the cooler master filter
isn't impeding air flow our panelists
test has us within margin of error of
the test barring the filter also 46
degrees over ambient idle temperatures
are 0.6 degrees lower in the panelist
test but that's within margin of error
and a be testing removing the filter
results in functionally equivalent
performance to removing the panel the
filter doesn't harm performance and we
get a two-degree boost over stock the
original age 500 P charted higher when
removing the front panel entirely but
this is within variance of being a
completely different set of fans all
three obviously fans have a lot of
variants between them and
original age 500 PT appears to have fans
that's been a bit faster therefore
causing some performance disparity
between the panelists tests
the difference is resultant of being
different fan units there's a lot of
variance from fan the fan comparatively
CPU thermals that land on the stock H
500 feet mass at 48 degrees placing it
just behind the anointed Silverstone our
l06 enclosure this is where the H 500 P
always belonged near the top of the
chart Coolermaster has now landed in the
top five or six cases on the chart
depending on how you tally them up and
comparatively the original H 500 P fell
towards the bottom of the charts down
near the fractal r6 a silence focused
cased and not distant from the dark bass
pro 900 also silence focused this is a
market improvement for Coolermaster thus
far they've resolved our thermal
concerns but we need to look at GPU next
moving on to GPU thermals with only the
H 500 pee on the charts the half acts
outperforms all modern iterations as a
result of its side mounted intake fan
the original h 500 p enclosure operated
the worst performance at 55 degrees
celsius over ambience and this was bad
enough to enter territory of clock drops
from Pascal temperature control the aged
500 P rated at fifty two point two
degrees over ambient when stock or sixty
four point one with the vertical GPU
still the worst possible configuration
as we're both against the glass and
against the tower cooler doesn't even
fit properly you need a reference size
card with an open-loop to really benefit
from this configuration still it's a
three degree improvement over the
original aged 500 P vertical GPU mount
at 68 degrees well into hard throttling
territory removing the panel or filter
produced once again equivalent results
to one another we were well within
margin of error for each and taking the
49 degree panelist figure against the
stock mesh case we're getting about
three degrees not bad at all gaining in
a positive direction and that's
considering the filter density for the
original case we saw an improvement of
approximately six degrees on the GPU by
removing the panel in the test
comparatively half X still sits atop its
throne on our GPU thermals chart
plotting at 47 degrees over ambient
within margin of error of the redline
zero six one of the best performers we
tested the original H 500 people formed
equivalently to the silence
focus dark based Pro 900 despite high
airflow marketing language which let's
just pop that back up on the screen for
a second this was from the reviewers
guide of the H 500 P this is why we had
so many problems with the aged 500 P it
was marketed and it was perceived as a
high airflow case but getting back to it
the mesh case lands between the Corsair
270 R and the Leon Lee alpha 550
performance is acceptable certainly
better it's not as impressive of an
uplift as we saw with CPU thermals but
it is most certainly an uplift
limitations here stem from dead zones on
the fan aligning with GPU intake and the
PSU shroud and the insulating
capabilities of that glass panel overall
it's much improved but there's room to
go further the 3d mark firestrike
extreme stress test pushed an average
GPU temperature to 52 point eight
degrees Celsius over ambiens within
margin of error of the torture test
temperature the stress test generally
causes a higher GPU temperature than the
torture test but the mesh remained
impressively cool overall it's much
better than its stock predecessors fifty
eight point nine degrees Celsius over
ambiens and the case is on our chart
that beat fifty two point eight C in
this test are the PMO one the RB 0 2 and
the 1/2 X all highly received cases in
our reviews we liked all of those to be
in company of those is quite good the
mesh is definitely no half axe
especially in terms of GPU cooling but
at least it seems like it's part of the
same family unlike the original age 500
P blender rendering on the cpu average
the CBO temperature of 35 degrees
Celsius one of our coolest scores thus
far that's tied with the rv0 2 and
within margin of error of the all-time
best RL 0 6 at 34 point four degrees
Celsius it did undercut the half X's
average by about 1.6 C and that's thanks
to more direct airflow across the CPU
cooler and the stock configuration with
air coolers this one has a partially
sealed acrylic top panel that also helps
with air pressure in a helpful direction
rather than
spitting it out at the top of the case
rendering on the GPU GPU temperature
average 25 point five degrees Celsius
which isn't quite as competitive as the
CPU temperatures but still good the RL 0
6 and RV's
to beat it here as did the cougar
conquer the PMO one and a half X all of
which are either well ventilated case is
known for cooling or in the case of the
conquer open air for a case with a fold
PSU shroud limiting airflow at the
bottom of the case this one did
relatively well and finally exchanging
the sealed acrylic front panel for an
open mesh one puts the h 500 P nose
levels at forty point seven DBA just a
bit louder than the originals 38.7 DBA
and roughly equivalent to our 40 DB a
mesh of five mod that we did personally
it's an acceptable trade-off but the two
hundred millimeter fans continue to be
louder than we'd expect since the major
benefit of large fans is typically
quieter operation always levels in the
mesh are comparable to the stock Lian Li
alpha or cooler master zone stock half x
so overall botch improve then it's I
mean I'm glad we bought it to test it
because this is a case that I could
recommend buying Coolermaster come on
guys so yeah quite an improvement things
we'd like to see change would include
the side panel mounting with a flathead
screwdriver so as far as some other
questions you might have the gray
version of the case there will still be
an acrylic version of the case there
should also be obviously the match
version of the case my understanding
when I last spoke to them which was when
we infiltrated their CES we don't
invited was that the change is made here
like the screw in the back of the top
panel and the clip in the front panel
that keeps both of these things secure
now my understanding is that these
changes should be coming down to the
gray version of the case even with the
acrylic in the front it's just kind of a
guessing game at this point because it
should be a silent change basically as
the current h 500 PS clear the channel
and all of them are sold and depleted
from inventory the new ones will come in
with these changes including also the
power supply mounting change so all the
good things except for the mesh part if
you still want acrylic because you're
doing liquid or you don't care or
whatever you can do that and have the
other improvements of this case it's
just I don't know when that will be true
but it should become true eventually a
couple of other notes you may have
noticed that the GPO temperatures don't
improve as much as CV temperatures if
you're
curious why just out of curiosity it's
because on fans there is a dead zone the
dead zone is where the hub is located so
the closer the fan is to an object it's
cooling like if you're right up against
a radiator the less air will go through
the area that is immediately behind the
hub because obviously air doesn't go
through a solid wall so in the case of
this enclosure the hub is just happens
to be located basically directly in line
with our open face cards face with the
cooling element on the card so because
of that you're not getting quite as much
high-pressure air flow straight into the
face of the cooler as you would if it
were positioned either slightly higher
or slightly lower so that the blades are
more in line with the lowest part of the
card where the fans are breathing air in
so it still looks fine but if you're
curious why performance is that way
that's why one other last thing I
suppose is this this is the sticker for
one of the fans after we're done with
all of our thermal testing this fell off
it doesn't matter it's just the sticker
on the back of the fan it's super oily
so that would suggest that maybe there's
a leak or there was too much oil on it
the fan works fine it's still lubricated
fine but it's a matter of oil getting on
to the sticker and then no longer having
adhesive properties which is okay but
yeah Coolermaster if you're watching
maybe look into that make sure it
doesn't happen to a bunch of other ones
that was really matter much just kind of
ugly because we put blue Gaffa tape on
there instead so yeah overall quickly
recapping there are a few points we did
improve
already went over them none of them are
deal breakers on the case as a case at
$150 it's actually quite good now this
is something that we would reasonably
recommend buying there I hesitate
because there are still really good
alternatives but the thing is this has a
pretty unique look you either love it or
you hate it and that's not being cliche
I mean it's it's 1980s transformer
aesthetic if you like that it actually
cools decently now so we have no
problems with anyone buying it if you
don't like it that's fine the pmo one is
still one of the best case
we've worked with the redline 0/6 both
Silverstone cases redline zero six at a
much cheaper price class if you can't
afford this half the price is also quite
good and in the same price bracket if
you want something more silence focused
be quiet has a couple of good options
the dark bass 700 has really good build
quality and good well.ok noise levels
it's not great for a couple of other
reasons and the fractal red lines or red
line zero six the fractal define r6 is
pretty good we reviewed that recently as
well so if you don't like this one those
are good alternatives we'd recommend I
think the biggest takeaway here is
Kohler Masters very strange way of
dealing with criticism and again I want
to be clear here with everyone I'm not
whining that we didn't get a review
sample I bought this I bought a three
thousand dollar Titan V I'm not afraid
of buying a case so it's not it's not
complaining that we didn't get something
for free it's just strange that the most
vocal critic was cut off from
communication I find that quite
disturbing and toxic to the community
because it builds an atmosphere where
people are afraid to criticize products
that's a really bad atmosphere to build
so that's what I would criticize the
most if I felt like it blonde in this
video but I'll leave it there and let
you think about it and perhaps we'll
talk about it at a later time for now
we'll leave it focused on the case it's
good overall definitely vindicated
good job coolermaster and team thank you
for incorporating the feedback and
whatever else you had in the pipe I'm
sure we didn't give you all of it so
credit where it's due
decent job overall thanks for watching
subscribe for more if you want to help
us out make sure that we can keep buying
stuff like this when people cut us off
from samples you go to
patreon.com/scishow stubs out directly
or if you prefer go to store doc gamers
nexus dotnet and back order one of our
mod mats they're pretty damn cool they
sold that instantly last time and they
