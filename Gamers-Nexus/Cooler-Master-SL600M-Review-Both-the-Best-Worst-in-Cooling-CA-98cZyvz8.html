Coolermaster has made this year there's
the H 500 and the SL 600 M it is in fact
a non 500 numbered case so one of the
more interesting ones we saw it at
Computex and it's interesting because it
tries to use the bottom the top intake
path which is actually it's done pretty
well in the past so we were excited to
try that with this one it's not an
inverted motherboard layout like the R
v02 or anything like that so all we're
doing here is taking what would
typically be in the front in this case
200 meter fans 2 of them putting them in
the bottom and allowing the air to go
straight up and out so very interesting
airflow path will have a lot of thermal
data on that and at $200 it's also
pretty competitive with a lot of the
other $200 cases that have come out this
year this year seems to be pretty big
for those higher-end cases so we're
going to look at this one today and see
if it's actually worth the price before
that this video is brought to you by
thermal Grizzly's high-end thermal paste
and liquid metal thermal Grizzly's cryo
knot is an affordable high quality
thermal compound that doesn't face some
of the aging limitations of other pastes
on the market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted test by a tube at the link
in the description below so this case
then at 200 bucks it's competing with a
few things get those out of the way
first first of all there are plenty of
h5 series cases from Coolermaster itself
so you're competing with their own H 500
be matched about 150 really good case at
that price the H 500 M which compared to
the mesh's feels a bit expensive but
it's about this price and then NZXT is
got their age 700 everything has an H in
it is the rule here and there are a
couple others as well but fantex has the
Evolve ex that we just looked at the non
upgrade kit that's 200 bucks as well so
there are a lot of $200 cases this year
and this one let's go over the main
features before we go through the build
notes and the really dense thermal
section this time four core features
obviously we got to talk about the front
panel on the back first now if you've
already typed your comment it's probably
time to scroll down and delete
unless you want to leave it there to
increase our engagement because no it is
not actually a closed-off front panel
with no intake anywhere it is a
closed-off front panel with intake on
the bottom but they've left enough room
here a significant amount of room where
it can actually breathe pretty well and
we tested this so we we have a trick we
do when manufacturers say we use chimney
effects or stack effects cooling and
they talk about how it's all just
natural convection hot air rises all
that stuff what we like to do is we like
to take the case and do this and now
that's the front and that's the back
it's hardness testing okay so this stack
back this chimney back yes it's a real
thing
absolutely there's science to it of
course we know that but the point we
always make is hot air rising doesn't
really overcome the power of a bunch of
fans and directional airflow and so if
you flip this case does the chimney
effect still matter
it is now a horizontal chimney it's more
of an exhaust pipe really and so with
this Pat air path as you'll see in our
numbers it performs about the same and
that's because ultimately what you're
dealing with is just some big 200
millimeter fans and then the internal
case fans pushing the air wherever the
air ends up going after that so the
Front's closed off and the more valid
reason to this not one of marketing
chimney stack effects whatever cooling
the more valid reason to do that is for
noise isolation because now you're
blocking off the only real exit path for
noise to where the users sitting which
is the front of the case and of course
the top if it's on the floor next to you
the back is closed as well and this is
something that maybe should be a little
more open than it is and the power
supply then because the back flows the
Front's closed and the bottom is
occupied by 200 meter fans power supply
ends up in the front and it's fan is not
really so the manual kind of recommends
installing it in a way that with this
PSU fan ends up kind of pointing the
front panel it can pull air in certainly
from the bottom it's fine the power
supplies can take a lot it's not
completely isolated but a bit better
access to air for the power supply would
be a decent idea if you're doing
anything with like really high wattage
systems with lawn uptime something like
that other interesting features so since
coffee tax we noted that context that
we'd like to see the top panel be have
an option to be more breathable because
you're gonna do bottom the top bear has
to exit somewhere you can't just take
the typical clothes out front design and
stick it on the top so they did actually
make it so that you can even just sit
this kind of elevate it or remove it
completely and we'll give them props to
that it doesn't even look that bad when
you remove it either looks just fine so
completely usable in that fashion
another thing here orienting the CPU
cooler is a big item of consideration
and one that we tested but the results
are not what you would expect and we'll
leave that for the thermal section so in
this current setup the last test we did
was with the cooler oriented vertically
this is opposite what we don't really do
where it's rotated about 90 degrees at
counterclockwise so different testing
there to look at we have numbers on that
but you'll want to carefully consider
your cooler choices and how you want to
orient them because RAM clearance
becomes a bit of a concern and then how
fat the cooler is versus how large the
video card is can also be a conflict if
you're not going with a CLC so cooler
masters done a lot of things right with
this case they've done something it's
kind of weird like for example the rear
because the power supplies in the front
you have to run a cable to the back
that's fine the dark base pro 900 does
it we'll talk about that more later but
they really should have a power switch
back there and you can do that pretty
easily you just hook it right in to the
cable and make it a simple toggle so
that could be easily done they don't
even have to run some crazy cable all
the way up here they don't have the
power with SATA nothing like that just a
switch that hooks into the extension
cord and tells it am i open or closed
right now and that's all it needs but
there plenty of good things to the looks
are very interesting they've got some
cool features up here like a motion
detector for the LED or for the LED that
is over the USB ports and then the rest
of it comes down to a unique approach to
cooling and noise and sound isolation so
we'll go through the build notes and
then talk thermals both the bottom and
top of the case have removable fan
mounts although the bottom mount is
larger and a bit more difficult to
remove the manual depicts installing a
radiator and intake fans on top of this
mount and
just leaving the to 200 millimeter
bottom intake fans in place which is
possible but we consider moving the
large fans to the top of the case in
such a configuration to better allow for
high pressure on the radiator since you
probably have fans with it anyway the
case legs are extra long to allow
clearance for the bottom intake and the
bottom of the chassis is lifted five
point five centimeters off of the table
service there's support for three
hundred sixty millimeter radiators at
the top or bottom but installing a full
length radiator means that the PSU cover
can't be extended to its full length
which in turn means a more restricted
cable management the front panel USB
ports illuminate with white LEDs when a
proximity sensor is tripped
it's definitely overkill feature but it
could still be helpful for finding the
ports in a dark room or something like
that it's not really that necessary of
course but it's something unique we were
able to activate the sensor from nearly
30 inches away with movement so there's
a good chance that the LEDs will just
stay on during normal use at least if
there's any kind of movement in the room
at all but it's still a cool idea and
it's not on an insanely expensive case
so that's good to the normal SSD mounts
behind the motherboard work just fine
but the combination of three and a half
and two and a half inch amounts could
clutter the interior depending on where
they're installed sticking them on the
inside of the front or back panels are
good options but putting them on the
bottom of the case and obstructing the
intake fans is not a good option the
metal plate on top of the case is
pressed into place with metal pins and
started into rubber washers the plate
can be lifted out and then rested on the
post so that there's some extra room to
allow for air flow while preserving the
overall look of the case or it can be
taken off completely this is the change
that was made sort of live during copy
taks
where coolermaster already started
making the decision to allow for this
semi modular top panel it's nice to see
Coolermaster offering an option again
for better cooling even if strictly
looks focused users may not take
advantage of it it's good to have there
you never know when you might need it
extra couple degrees for some really
work intensive tasks the front of the
case is dedicated to housing the power
supply and is unventilated this is by
design the back of the case is also
sealed as tightly as possible and bow
decisions are intentional Coolermaster
wants air to enter the bottom of the
case and eggs at the top with as few
complications as possible the aluminum
front plate is secured to the underlying
frame with screws but unfortunately a
couple of these screws didn't make
contact in our sample and the plate
arrived loose not a big deal and easy
enough to fix there was also a small
piece of plastic broke off from the
inside of the panel so it was shipping
damage it's okay it's not gonna happen
to everyone but we did want to know it
it may be cool air mask can make sure
it's packed extra carefully for that
front panel
either way though easy enough to work
with and easy enough to retighten if it
did arrive loose and your scenario the
floor is lava in the SL 600 there's no
power supply shroud at the bottom which
would be the usual spot to hide extra
cables and there are 400 millimetres of
spinning fan blades instead the power
supply is housed in a two-part cover at
the front of the case which can be
adjusted to take up more or less space
as desired we have a lot of loose cables
in our case review system so we set it
to the maximum possible size and still
found it a little cramped Coolermaster
did a good job of providing plenty of
tie points along the front and bottom
edges of the case but this case still
requires more care than usual in
strapping down every loose end to get
the panel on and make sure nothing falls
by way of gravity into the fans one very
minor points related to the power supply
placement is that there is no easily
accessible power switch on the case SL
600m uses an internal extension cable to
reach the power supply just like the
dark base pro 900 did but the DBP added
a secondary power switch to the rear of
the case since the real power supply
switch was inaccessible Coolermaster
should have done the same here it's an
oversight it's a small one but it is an
oversight by Coolermaster and something
that we think they could fairly easily
improve for the next iteration
coolermaster mentions the quote chimney
affects multiple times their marketing
material the idea is that since hot air
naturally rises it's better to push air
bottom to top rather than front to back
the foundation for this is fact but it
is overcome by the power of forced
airflow can't really beat thousands of
rpm with just natural rising of hot air
as we discussed in the RV zero to review
it really doesn't matter all that much
for cases like these PC cases are metal
boxes that are covered in fans it
completely upsets natural convection as
with the RV zero two we tested this by
flipping the case onto its front panel
and seeing whether that changed anything
and you'll see those results momentarily
even if it doesn't though that doesn't
mean that the layout isn't beneficial
it's just for other reasons not that
specific reason of hot air rising we
also tested with a top panel popped up
the top panel removed and in the
vertical GPU configuration we chose to
utilize the SL 600 ms rotatable pci
bracket window to mount the GPU as close
to the motherboard as possible for
optimal airflow getting it closer to the
motherboard and farther from the window
will increase the amount of breathable
air in front of the card which is
counter it's what we typically see with
these configurations there are two slots
already vertical in the stock
configuration appropriate for liquid
cooled cards but otherwise rotating the
bracket window is a better and
functionally identical choice the main
advantage of using these stock vertical
slots is that it also allows installing
PCI devices in the normal horizontal
slot simultaneously whereas rotating the
window means that every usable expansion
slot is vertical and requires a riser
cable for the best thermals it would be
ideal to rotate the CPU cooler as well
so that it lines up with the case
airflow in theory anyway and so we
decided to rotate our cooler from its
standard configuration for a couple of
passes a vertical orientation on the
cooler as well note that we had to
change our memory due to memory
clearance issues with air cooler rotated
this way but also memory doesn't really
impact thermal results in any meaningful
way talking less than a watt of
difference in most scenarios so
unfortunately this is a temporary change
of configuration but we wanted to note
it be aware that the CPU temperature is
it will be more sensitive in these two
different types of configurations to
your cooler selection than anything else
compatibility will also depend on your
configuration for RAM clearance and
should be a consideration when buying
we'll be using our standardized test
configuration in the ancillary
benchmarks the cooler oriented front to
back for these and we'll use the
cooller orientation only for the CPU and
GPU torture tests let's start with just
the SL 600mm cpu thermals and then look
at comparative data after that we have a
lot of benchmarks for different
configurations here including a quote
best-case configuration with the cooler
oriented vertically with a vertical GPU
below it CPU torture testing with the
fully stock configuration brought CB
temperature to sixty two point six
degrees Celsius over ambient flipping
the case on to the front panel and
negating the supposed chimney effect
actually brought the temperature down a
bit falling to fifty nine point two
degrees over ambient this is just
outside of our error tolerances the
temperature decrease is a change in
impedance to the now front panel rather
than pulling from a tabletop the 200
millimeter intake fans were pulling from
open air that's not a huge difference
though and if anything it suggests that
cooler master provided sufficient
clearance at the bottom of the case for
vent any major problems
well done by coolermaster they're
popping the top panel up had
approximately the same benefit to cpu
cooling with a temperature of fifty nine
point three degrees cells he's over
ambient while removing it completely
slightly lowered it again down to fifty
eight point two degrees delta T it was
the vertical GPU tasks that provided the
most benefit for once ranking the lowest
CPU temperature of all of our tests at
fifty five point five degrees for this
case anyway
this is because mounting the GPU
vertically moves it out of the way the
incoming air which is more easily able
to travel up to the CPU cooler and out
the top of the case Eric can get around
both sides of the video card which has
an added benefit of providing some
backplate cooling as well because the
backplate on this card contacts the back
of the PCB and does conduct heat so we
have extra cooling advantages keep in
mind that all of these tests that we
just named or with the cooler in our
standard position front to back we then
ran two sets of tests with the cooler
removed and reapplied each time with new
pastes each time and with a curing
period for those tests validate the data
was accurate by comparing the runs to
each other and to our baseline
performance the new tests were with
equal or vertically oriented in this
configuration the tower cooler is
breathing air in straight from the GPU
exhaust
despite being seemingly superior it
actually ends up more
without a specific configuration we're
at 64.6 degrees over ambience
approaching the 90s when considering a
22 degree room temperature and that
drops to 62 degrees with the cover
removed we ran this test again and
validated the results let's get some
shots of the case on the screen again if
you're wondering why it's behaving like
this first keep in mind that every
configuration will behave differently
and so this is representative of
configurations similar to ours where you
have a tower cooler not a CLC and where
you have a an open face video card or
something similar to this one it's
pretty straight forward otherwise
although the case would theoretically
benefit from the cooler being oriented
vertically something that Coolermaster
also suggests the reality is that the
cooler is now breathing and the open
face card exhaust directly previously
that exhaust only radiated toward the
fin stack where the higher pressure of
the CPU fan would push the radiative
heat away from the cooler and toward the
back of the case where it eventually
drafted up and out an open face video
card cooler is among the most common and
those coolers exhaust air out of the fin
stack it's getting the full exhaust of
the video card here rather than whatever
drifted around to the front of the
cooler previously back to the
comparative data though with a different
chart as it is with our configuration
the stock CB temperature is just bad its
equivalent to the Antec p8 the case with
the cooling capacity of a toaster even
opening or removing the top panel still
leaves the SL 600 mm at the upper end of
the charge the twist is that with the
GPU mounted vertically CPU temperature
becomes more acceptable closer to the
stock land cool want there are a few
reasons for this performance again the
CPU is now the most distant device from
the fans rather than a typical
configuration in the case where their
air hits both the CPU and the GPU at
roughly the same time and it's probably
not been preheated by another component
we've got a configuration that creates a
much shorter distance to the video card
in the SL 600 M that's the whole design
of the case that card also partially
obstructs air intakes of the CPU it pre
heats the air and if it's a longer car
that can cause other issues the CPU is
left with breathing and warmed radiative
heat off of the backside of the GPU and
circulating some of the heat from the
GPU but the GPU does very well stock GPU
temperature was 45 degrees Celsius over
ambient when loaded this changed to 45
point two degrees delta T when the case
was flipped onto its front and as well
within margin of error
the intake fans blast to the GPU cooler
equally well regardless of case
orientation and hot air rising and case
orientation really have nothing to do
with this behavior its its fans within
inches of the front of the video card
opening the top panel without taking it
off resulted in a temperature of forty
six point one degrees within margin of
error and test variance there's
functionally no difference for GPU
cooling which makes sense when
considering the proximity to the bottom
for the card and that the exhaust is
really of no consequence to it this is
reinforced by looking at the top removal
data where forty five point five degree
result tells us that these do not
meaningfully affect the cheapy
performance we knew mounting the GP
vertically would hurt their own
performance somewhat because it would no
longer be directly facing the intake
fans but the jump to forty eight point
four degrees Celsius dollars he over
ambience is reassuringly minor and sees
plenty of air still makes its way into
the cooler comparatively the stock GB
result in the SL 600 M is a new best on
our chart thanks to the extremely direct
cooling from the bottom and take fan so
congratulations to Coolermaster for that
placement the vertical GPU temperature
those slightly worse was still among the
best results we've seen that means that
using the vertical expansion slot
closest to the motherboard is still
great for GPU cooling and does a decent
job at allowing CPU cooling so we
definitely recommend this layout for
systems using the air cooling that don't
need any non GPU PCIe cards installed
moving on to 3d mark using our standard
I set up firestrike GPU temperature was
just slightly above torture thermals
averaging forty six point three degrees
Celsius over ambient that's again
technically better than any case on the
charge although the half X is close
enough as to make no difference between
the two CB temperature during the test
was thirty four point nine degrees which
is pretty high for a benchmark that
doesn't really put any serious load on
the CPU that's close to BitFenix and so
territory which is partly due to the
airflow configuration in this case and
how the video card is now an item of
consideration where you're creating a
wall but also dealing with radiative
heat in a more significant way than is
typical for the 3d mark chart the case
is simultaneously the best and the worst
on the chart the blender CPU rendered
test raised CPU temperature to thirty
eight point nine degrees over ambiens
under a reasonable workload the relative
performance was it better than it
during the torture test because the GPU
doesn't generate really much heat at all
here but it's still on par with the
mediocre silverstone klo 7 in
performance this test does confirm that
the main problem with CPU thermals isn't
the heat that it generates on its own
it's also the heat that the GPU
generates all that extra power has to go
somewhere and it isn't being circulated
out because the airflow path is blocked
again the vertical GP amount helps to
solve this in some ways and is
illustrated in our earlier charts the
GPU render a verdict Riis celsius over
ambient on the video card a full degree
below the previous best temperature in
the 1/2 X the 1/2 X is CPU temperature
during this test with 26.8 for
consideration while the SL 600m was
thirty point eight degrees Celsius over
ambience moving on to noise with the
fans at max speed the SL 600m reached
thirty seven point seven DBA given the
cooling performance that's reasonable
it's around the Obsidian 500 D or the s
340 elites the size of the two hundred
millimeter fans gives the case a bit of
an advantage in this area because a
bigger fan can spin slower to move the
same amount of air through a wider hole
placing the fans on the bottom also
helps here as does sealing the case in
the front and the back because those are
the panels that would most likely impact
what the user picks up audibly
cluemaster zone h 500 h 500 p and h 500
m cases use the same fans but are all
marginally louder because of the case
laughs the fans position toward the
front of the case where the user is most
likely seated according to cooler
masters marketing materials where the
review guides things like that that
they've sent out the SL 600 M is
intended to keep quote both
professionalism and performance intact
while also taking on noise reduction and
airflow presumably not reduction of
airflow that's it's a decent description
of what's going on here the case does
definitely look interesting and
depending on how you feel about it it's
probably leaning towards the good side
it's it's a very unique look I'll leave
it to you whether you like that or not
as that its objective so they've done
something different there it does kind
of have that sleek professionalism
motif that's going on now and other than
that with the right layout the interior
of the SL 600 M can definitely act like
a wind tunnel which is a good thing
while staying relatively quiet so
they've done well their component
selection is important so as we've
always talked about case testing is
difficult because every single component
is a variable and there's no avoiding it
and so for our testing we found that
open-face cards positioned vertically
actually do really well if you don't
have other PCI devices you need
connected we would recommend that
configuration tower coolers are a bit
rough so to fix the CPU thermal numbers
we had here what we would recommend is
probably put another exhaust somewhere
in the case and maybe even leave the
cooler oriented that way really it has
to test it see how your specific
configuration does but for ours it would
be best to rotate the cooler back the
traditional way contrary to what you
might think cuz there's no exhaust here
put a fan up top and then as it blows
the air out it'll help get rid of it but
it's tough because really what we'd like
to see is still a hole in the back here
I mean really closing it off you get an
SSD mount or drive them out there but at
the end of the day this back panel being
closed is not contributing in a major
fashion to noise isolation because it's
not gonna be near the user at all so
we'd like to see this opened up and then
have a fan mount out in there instead
because then then you can have really
good GPU cool I mean the the GPU
thermals and our charts were the best so
cooler master has chart tops now for GP
thermals and that's great for them and
of course they've done well there but
the CPU thermal it's like it's the best
and the worst case for cooling
simultaneously CPU thermals you can cut
you can conquer them two ways you can
get a CLC in there or something like
that and relative to other cases it will
be warmer but it'll be cool enough that
it's not really that important or
Coolermaster perhaps consider in the
future doing a whole back where it goes
here and allowing an exhaust fan and
that would free up a lot of the thermal
Headroom for the CPU that we lose from
shoving all the GPU heat into it so some
items consideration we like the case
overall it does fine it's got a lot of
competitors
age 700 is a great one to look at H 500
P mesh is another good one to look at if
you want to say 50 bucks and get some
more cool InFocus age 500 M if you like
Coolermaster and want something that's a
bit different looking on this and then
fantex evolve X is another one to
consider we have reviews of all those
cases on our channel check them out if
you want to see more but this one's done
quite a few things right and as a
consequence of being unique it's also
got some really peculiar thermal
characteristics but ones which you can
overcome just plan for them and you'll
be fine but this configuration is great
for GPU and not so much for CPU so
that's it for this one as always thank
you for watching go to store documents X
