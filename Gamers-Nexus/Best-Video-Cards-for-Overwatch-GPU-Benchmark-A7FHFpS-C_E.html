dotnet and we're here to talk about our
overwatch GPU benchmark that we ran over
the weekend there was another overwatch
beta weekend so big disclaimer here it
is in beta where it was at least in beta
and that means nothing's finalized the
optimizations aren't done and drivers
aren't done from Nvidia or AMD so at
this point all of the performance
metrics are or should be temporary and
that because the drivers sports not
there and the game is not optimized
fully so what you see here is not
necessarily applicable to the game as it
launches if you're watching this in 2016
then maybe check and see we've done an
updated benchmark to make sure that the
optimizations haven't changed in
substantially but still the game is
fairly playable across most GPUs in our
test suite and that's what you'll see
here today so it is a it's a it's a
decent title in terms of scalability
across GPUs and the main thing here is
that blizzards got a fairly useful
settings menu where you have good
control over the options and in our
initial settings tests where we look at
Delta between different setting options
there is actually a pretty big disparity
between some of the less useful settings
which means that you can get a good
amount of FPS out of something without
necessarily losing a noticeable amount
of fidelity if you are on a lower MGP
you so let's dive into it here we
already released the benchmark course on
the channel it's less than two minutes
the video the course itself is 30
seconds and you can see that if you want
to replicate our results or try and see
where we got our data the course was
done in single-player to eliminate a lot
of variables a ton of variables we
always a single player were possible and
in limited testing for internal use at
gamers Nexus we found that the Delta for
single player versus player was
generally pretty low so even with the
added characters we weren't seeing a
huge amount of impact to framerate and
that's a good thing that means our tests
are easier to scale and reproduce the
only time there was a big impact was
when sort of everyone converged on one
spot and there was a lot of action a lot
of effects going on at the same time in
those cases there was an FPS
packed with a couple percent but overall
this is a pretty reliable test for
multiplayer and singleplayer the items
in the settings look out for include
primarily render scale surrender scale
just super samples and down samples the
rendered resolutions of screen that's
all it really does and render scale
comes to it comes a different couple
different flavors so there's a low which
is a 50% scale that means you're down
sampling your resolution quite a bit
down 50% from what it would natively be
which is a hundred percent there is
medium at seventy-five percent high at
100% that's what we ran these on and
what you should probably run them on
unless you're on a setting where you
want to super sample ultra 150 percent
and epic at 200% what that means is if
you run ultra and you're on a 1080
display you're effectively rendering of
1440 output so that's similar to DSR and
VSR from Nvidia and AMD and epic at 200%
is effectively a 4k output if you're on
a 1080 monitor and this has the impact
of just running natively at 1440 or 4k
so if you do the render scale ultra or
epic there will be a performance hit to
the same tune of a resolution increase
that's it's about the same
the next item anti-aliasing is listed as
low medium high and ultra which is a
little confusing so what these mean low
is FX AAA which is kind of the blurrier
but very performance friendly setting
medium is SMA a low quality not sure how
many taps that is I'm guessing it's
probably 2x high is medium quality
probably 4x and ultra is is high quality
which is going to be probably 8x or 16x
we haven't confirmed those numbers yet
the initial settings comparisons we did
look at a couple of the different
settings in the game and compare them
across multiple resolutions so the the
biggest impact to a setting performance
wise is going to be changing the render
scale and if you run epic it's basically
four times the resolution that you're
rendering if you're at 1080 so I were
actually at any resolution because a
200% increase so render scales the first
thing to look at for improve
performance ambient inclusion has about
an 8.5% FPS impact and disabling this
reduces the apparent depth of things
like foliage and trees and buildings it
reduces the shading and depth of our
appearance of depth on objects as
surfaces connect we have a wall like
that or something that's kind of
sticking out more than other then the
ambient occlusion value will affect that
and it's an 8.5% performance it
refractions effectively zero FPS impacts
we need to further research that local
reflections again negligible impact
effectively zero FPS that's things like
mirrors and mirror like surfaces
metallic surfaces texture filter quality
is normally something like anisotropic
filtering which generally has about a
zero performance impact but in this case
we saw a 3.7 percent Delta between max
and off and that helps with the
application of textures on non oblique
angled surfaces dynamic reflections was
a huge impact on FPS so at the max
versus high range we saw a hit of about
29% at the Hybris medium range we saw
13% and at medium versus low we saw
almost 15% performances so that's the
second place to go after render scale a
quality couple FPS between settings so
that's really not a big hit right now
that may change will research it more
our first set of charts here shows the
preset scalability testing so this is an
internal test we always conduct but I
decided publish at this time and this
shows relative performance across a
single configuration just the 980ti
and it shows deltas between frame rates
at low medium high ultra and epic and
that informs our decision on which
settings to test for the final benchmark
so we can't do them all realistically
the first chart shows the Delta loss
gain Delta loss and gain from setting to
setting and this is only one charge so
you're only looking at the average FPS
you don't see one percent and 0.1% lows
here and this shows ultra as our
established go-to setting that's why you
see it at a hundred percent that's
effectively what we're considering
normal for this test what we think most
people will be running and if you look
at the other the scaling
here Ultra is about 26 percent faster
than epic which scales up a few of the
settings and it's about 30 percent
slower than high with low allowing
almost anything to play overwatch but
note here that we were hitting 300 FPS
which is the games cap right now so it
might actually be an even bigger gap
between low and medium depending on
where it's capping out on FPS 4k for the
first benchmark we're looking at the
fork HRT's this is obviously a pretty
heavy hitter on the GPU sweet reducing
the render scale to medium which is a
75% render pushes FPS about 20 to 30 20
to 30 FPS higher across these cards on
the 980ti
especially but at that point you're
basically reducing your resolution so
it's worth considering dropping to 1440p
natively there's currently no SLI
profile from we've gathered I'm getting
some crossfire tests done in the next
beta so we'll figure out if there's any
scaling there but SLI performance shows
zero scaling across all resolutions and
presets testing right now tested right
now which means that you're seeing these
results where it's kind of unplayable at
these settings with 4k you have to you
would drop the settings substantially or
just reduce the resolution of play
overwatch is a game where you really
want close to 60 F guesses it does start
to feel jarring and weird at 50 even 55
FPS so I would try to target 60 here
running epic with a high render scale
1440p resolution is a lot less brutal to
the GPS than the 4k resolution test
which is 4.6 million pixels at more than
1440 so it makes sense the game runs
reliably with high frame rates from the
390 X and up including the 970 the 390 X
of course the 980 and the 980 TI and
these are 9 to 90 X runs close enough
that some minor tweaks would push it
over the top but low 0.1% frame times
hammer and these cards across all of the
overwatch tests so this is an
optimization level issue either on
blizzards end or Andes driver's side and
is something that should be seriously
considered I would not base potentially
a GPU purchase on these results right
now because as drivers roll out this
0.1% hit that exists on Andy and not and
Vidya
potentially be reduced at 1080 epic
that's probably what a lot of you will
be running if not 1080 ultra this shows
how well blizzards overwatch plays on
most hardware at 1080p and Andy again
suffers from poor 1% low and point one
percent low frame delivery but averages
are up across the board for all cards
the drops do hit harder and the hardware
though optimization should resolve this
is going forward by looking at the other
stuff everything from the GTX 960 and up
including the 380 X is brand new 970 the
290 X and so forth kind of run overwatch
reliably at 60fps with 1080p epic and
there are 9 285 is close enough that
we'd consider it within striking range
if you made some tweaks and this is a
look at the 1080p Ultra chart which is a
lot more forgiving on the cards you can
see that the lower end hardware
including even the 950 starts to enter
decent playability range so what's the
best video card for overwatch it depends
on your settings of course right now at
1080p it's fairly playable on the GTX
960 which is 170 at 2 gigabytes 200 plus
at 4 gigabytes the r9 380 another $280
card where the r9 380 X was brand new
and is a couple percent higher average
performance than the Nvidia cards at the
competing price range what has worse low
frame times at 1440 we shift our
recommendations toward the r9 380 390 x
excuse me and the GTX 970 which is been
on pretty crazy sales lately about $290
with the 970 performing significantly
higher in 0.1% low so that is definitely
something to consider but again it's a
beta so it might change 4k is
effectively unplayable right now as the
SLI and crossfire profiles come out as
the games optimize that might change if
you want to play 4k right now you've got
to do it on a high-end hardware so
that'd be a 980ti or fury ax or similar
which we do not have a fury X for
testing right now and you would still
have to drop your settings from ultra or
epic down to something like medium or
mix of medium and high which is not
really something that feels great to do
but it would allow 4k to be more
playable on a mix of high and medium and
maybe you wanted to alter settings so
you have to do a lot of tuning there to
get that working properly right now but
that is all for this benchmark get check
the channel for all the other stuff and
of course the benchmark course that we
already ran to see the max graphics
output of overwatch here's what it looks
like and check the patreon link if you
