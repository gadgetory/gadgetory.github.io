nexus donna i am joined by richard
garriott working on trout of the avatar
with portal areum and we're going to
give a quick update on the news for a
shroud of the avatar but first if you
could rope our new viewers in to tell us
about trial the Avatar what's really
cool about it sure sure so shroud of the
avatar is a medieval fantasy online
role-playing game you actually can play
as a solo player game throttling all the
way up through a massively multiplayer
like experience and I often would
describe it as the spiritual successor
to the Ultima series that's obviously
what for those of you know me as Lord
British that's when I'm best known for
and and a team you know half or more of
my team is has origin and Ultima history
so we're very glad to be back in the
thick of what we think we do best and in
terms of recent updates we previously
spoke at CES sorry a pack south what's
been going on since then but we're up to
release 15 so as soon as we even had an
avatar walking around on a map every
month on the third Thursday of the month
at twelve noon central time we have
released the next iteration to all of
our backers and and and starting in
november we actually have now left the
game up running 24 hours a day seven
days a week as if it's a final finished
service which obviously it's not but in
in all those 15 months and four months
of twenty-four seven we've had zero
server failures so we're actually very
proud of our track record you know with
doing such a very large complex
client-server game and yet have already
a good stability but but what's special
about this release is we've made a full
switch to unity 5 from four it's going
to allow us to make the game iverything
much better looking than we had
previously had we were happy with it
before but we literally punched up to
triple-a quality we have put in a deeper
crafting system that makes weapons much
more unique and have maker's marks and
unique histories that I think that
people really enjoying and we made it to
where now finally people's backer
rewards show up with them in the game
it's now there's been a run on getting
all the things
into your own home that says now that
that part of the features has turned on
so what's the plan for the immediate
future following this release well
beautification is definitely the next
piece for us so we we had a we were we
were worried we were going to break our
record for stability as in as in ruin it
when we made the switch from unity 45 is
so much to do just to have the art not
look worse and be stable but we pulled
it off the game still nice and stable
but this next iteration that's going to
be one of our major focuses and we're
all ready now to a place where we think
we're about eighty percent complete on
game systems and so what we're really
doing now is flashing those out so if
you look at the magic systems maybe half
the spells are in and we're not going to
be finishing those other half as fast as
we can same thing with all the crafting
recipes same thing with all the combat
skills it's more of a population game
and to the next two or three months
we'll be finishing those systems that'll
get us to alpha and then finish all the
maps and then would be beta and we'll be
out sounds good to me so for more
