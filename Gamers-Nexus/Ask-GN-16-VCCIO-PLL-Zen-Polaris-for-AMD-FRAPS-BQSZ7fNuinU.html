episode of ask GN where we answer your
questions so if you have questions for
next episode post them below I'll try
and get to a few of them we normally do
four or five per episode but that said
let's jump right into it so coming out
of pax here we decided to round up the
questions from the last episode and the
first one is from absent who says hey
Steve would you be able to explain these
various voltage settings I found in my
UEFI they are VCC i/o VCC PLL and vc ssa
Thanks so these are all overclock
settings for the CPU or parts of the CPU
VCC is voltage core or v core that is
the one that refers generally when
someone's talking about increasing the
voltage their CPU there's a lot of
different voltages you can increase so
if someone just says blanket statement I
needed to increase the voltage by 0.65
volts normally they're talking about VCC
or v core in other definitions and
that's what you use to sort of stabilize
the entire thing if you're just trying
to increase the clock rate or the
multiplier the next question was VCC io
VCC io is the input output voltage
control that's what the io means just
like anywhere else in computing and VCC
io is used primarily for managing the
integrated memory controller so memory
controller was moved from the
motherboard to CPUs a long time ago now
at this point used to be a separate
component on the motherboard just like
Intel's got their fiber which is their
integrated voltage regulator module on I
think the first one that did it might
have been as well or maybe before that
but either way they moved the VRM onto
the CPU that used to be a separate
component on motherboards as well it was
still there throughout this time but it
became less important that's going away
eventually fiber will be gone but that's
beside the point the VCC IO is for
managing the memory controller for the
most part voltage so if you're
increasing your clock rates on your
memory pretty heavily and you're having
issues with stability but fine-tuning
the tertiary settings on the memory
isn't fixing it
then the VCC i/o setting is where I
would start looking next if it's a CPU
stability issue most good motherboards
will do this for you though they'll find
to that like the x99 boards a lot we'll
do that next one was VCC PLL so PLL is
phase-locked loop you'll see this in
almost all of the AMD and 3 plus
motherboard settings as well the PLL
settings VCC PLL is for the the clock
multiplier so it governs the multiplier
so if you're having issues maintain
stability as you increase the multiplier
that is one of the finer tuned settings
you can play with if you don't want to
leave it in Auto generally you don't
need to mess with this on your own it
should Auto should sort of sort things
out but if you go in more extreme with
your overclock it's worth definitely
playing around with and and Andy's got
some different PLL settings that should
be spoken about separately which we'll
do in a future video potentially next
the last one was vc ssa and that is the
system agent voltage so that one is for
the base clock stability so you have IO
for memory clock or memory controller
stability you have a normal VCC V core
and then you have SAS or SATA agent and
that is for base clock so if you're
doing fine tuning on the base clock
which kind of became a bigger thing in
the last few generations then you would
be getting playing around with the VCS s
or s a setting on UEFI so hopefully that
answers those briefly anyway next
question is from sent March
who says considering and these poor
results over the last years and market
share compared to those of its
competitors if the next polaris GPU
lineup doesn't make andis market share
go up should we expect it to be the last
generation of team red GPUs that's
certainly a big statement same question
for Zen architecture on the CPU side no
I don't think even even if it failed
pretty badly by and these standards I
don't think it would be the last
generation because the Vagos pretty
close for Vita is pretty close it should
be end of year or early next year so
that's already well within production
and will probably be shipping almost no
matter what at this point but I mean
that would be a pretty big failure to
trigger something like that
actually because Samsung has sort of
bailed out Andy recently so Samsung and
NVIDIA have been engaged in a battle
there legally fighting each other over a
million different patent infringement
lawsuits they've both lost and gained
ground and then am the in Sampson I've
been working together and so Sampson is
manufacturing the new silicon for AMD
and that is definitely gonna be helping
and inna one part of speculation here is
is it possible that the GPU division ati
formerly could be spun off and I think
that is a possibility depending on how
things go over the next few months for
AMD but if it if it were to happen I
would have Samsung at the top of my list
for interested buyers I don't think
we're there just yet though and I don't
know that we'll get there as for Zen
their CPUs have been pretty weak so FX
is the last major CPU architecture from
Andy in the sort of core gaming market
the enthusiast market FX is not
particularly strong anymore and that
leaves their ap use and their locked
their IP locked CPUs which basically
cover the low end and maybe mid-range ap
market so Zen is pretty important for
them but I don't have a lot of
speculation on that right now because
still decent ways out Polaris though is
right around the corner has his Pascal
next question is from Oberst who I think
you've answered these questions before
and I still can't pronounce your name so
post it below unless you enjoyed that
this one okay how about this one
fraps hasn't been updated for three
years do you know of any program that's
going to take its place in a Vulcan dx12
world that is a program with the
usability stability and functionality of
fraps so far I've only seen recommend
and recommendations of software that
doesn't quite do everything I want it to
do is the the paraphrase there so
perhaps does a lot of things we use it
for benchmark and actually sell in frame
times and that's pretty hard to find
elsewhere afterburner tries to do it but
does a poor job isn't as in-depth of the
frame times and NZXT scam is an active
development we've actually been working
with them to try and help them develop
kam to do the things we wanted to do on
the review side
that is one that I've personally done a
lot of testing with and have validated
to some degree but it still got a ways
to go and the trouble here is because
these the software is built for dx11
so it has trouble talking through the
new API is it can't really see through
it fraps especially has issues where you
just can't even use it in almost all
cases with a new API so that
necessitates a new software tool and
games like ashes of singularity you have
the all the FPS monitoring built-in
because they know this is a problem but
they still want to be a benchmark for
the new api's so kam would be where I'd
be looking I know they're trying to
support dx12 in Vulcan afterburner
I know is trying to support it as well
but I'm not too happy with the
afterburner FPS monitoring but neither
of these really does sort of what fraps
does which is everything and perhaps
does not do video well so that's not
something I would really say is stable
or good it's it's very abusive it's like
four gigabytes per minute you better off
with shadow play or gbr or whatever
they're calling it now for AMD OBS is
better than fraps for video so there's a
lot of tools out there for video that I
would do before fraps
but there's nothing that really does it
all so you could kind of segmented right
now it's like shadow play gbr OBS or
video and then cam for dx12 Vulcan fps
hopefully but they have some some stuff
to work out still especially on my
accuracy of the 1% and 30.1% lows next
question last question actually Jonathon
caves says I'm tempted to sell my 980ti
whilst I wait for Pascal and Polaris
which of these look more promising
unlimited information as of now so that
we can't really comment on because of a
lot of reasons but mostly that neither
of them is out and in the hands of
reviewers so we don't have numbers and
just based on the architectures we've
the limited architecture information
we've seen it's not really time to say
which one looks more promising other
than wait for reviews and see how those
look we know that both of them will be
reducing TDP Polaris certainly did it in
the CES demo they were running lower TDP
but also they had an FPS lock
and we knew that gtx 950 was probably
outperforming the polaris card in terms
of raw FPS the Polaris was far and away
outperforming the 950 in terms of TDP
but then Pascal is going to lower TDP
too so they might actually end up being
neck-and-neck in that scenario as far as
fps that's just going to have to be
tested that we haven't seen any demos
for just yet so I can't really answer
that question right now should you sell
the 980 I I don't know that's still a
really good card one question here of
course to pay attention to is which GPU
will AMD and NVIDIA ship first because
in the past they've both done this thing
where they either ship the high-end
first like in this case we'll call it a
1080 or call it a 490 X or something
like that they'll either ship the
high-end or in recent generations like
with Maxwell version 1 and video ships
the low-end the 750 Ti so you saw your
980ti today and they end up shipping the
low-end card first you could be waiting
a pretty long time for a comparable card
to come out but we'll just see which one
they decide to ship first once it
happens it's probably around or before
it slightly after Tommy Texas sometime
in the next 30 ish maybe 60 days one to
two months so that is all for this time
if you have more questions post them in
the comments below we'll get to them
