Nexus tonight we were at ECG C 2015 the
East Coast game conference I'm joined by
Jim Brown senior designer at Epic Games
hello and we just came from Jim's talk
about Unreal Tournament and the
community and community involvement and
I you brought up some interesting items
that are involved in the development
process so you showed heat maps right
and can you explain what a heat map is
and what it does for you right so we
actually started data tracking on Gears
of War was kind of the first time that
we had done that internally and heat
maps really just kind of show where
people well you can use them in various
different ways the example I used in
that particular talk I had two up there
which was one was showing where players
move in a map so it's kind of a top-down
look at the topography of the map and it
just draws a little light essentially
every time somebody steps someplace and
so you can see like the path that they
take as they move through the world and
then it changes color based on how many
people or how often that particular spot
is visited the other thing that we use
them for in Gears in particular was to
show we just basically drop a marker
whenever somebody died and so then we
can go back and see how they died who
killed them you know all that other type
of information but in Gears in
particular what we were looking for was
we were trying to create a very specific
type of gameplay that funneled people
into kind of a central front in the map
so that you can spawn and run in and
always the combat was always going to
maintain on the central fronts and by
tracking player movement and player
deaths we can see when that front fell
apart and then try and figure out why
and how to fix it if it wasn't happening
and are there any particular elements in
level design that you find players
respond almost programmatically to is
there if I see a set of stairs am I
expected to respond a certain way yeah I
mean there's any number of elements
there's all these rules I mean I could
spend forever talking about it it's just
about how you group objects together or
you know
there's light in the doorway that's in a
dark hallway it'll pull people there
people's mentally respond different to
ramps and they do the stairs for example
and just whether some place looks
accessible or not really influences how
often they move there there's very very
subtle things just in the architecture
of a space or nooks and crannies where
people can hide that kind of give these
visual cues or even and have really
dramatic outcomes to the way the game
unfolds in Gears for example our camera
was over behind you over your right
shoulder
and that led to a lot of problems
looking around corners because you could
swing the camera out around the right
but you couldn't do that to the left so
that really really influenced the way
that we had to build a lot of our spaces
because even just building a symmetrical
space when you flip it around all the
corners that you can look around from
one side are now over balanced because
the guys on the other side can't see
that so it took a lot of work to work
through those issues and then again you
know in in in first-person like we're
doing with Unreal Tournament you know
how high the camera is your field of
view all of that influences how the
world feels when you're moving through
it you have to have your scale correct
not only in in terms of like how wide is
the door but you know are there visual
cues that kind of let the player know
how large they are in comparison to the
world around that I mean it's like it's
really kind of cascading things so
there's any number of ways that you
could you could tackle that so it sounds
like level design as much as it is
designed is also partly a science it
absolutely is and because that's one of
the reasons we really started doing a
lot of the data tracking that we did and
really trying to look at it more from
not just a pure design perspective a lot
of design is actually about
human-computer interaction and
understanding how people react how
people interpret and human behavior just
in general
and there's a lot of elements that play
into that that are more complicated than
just making a fun gameplay space very
cool so for more information of course
Unreal Tournament is actively in
development can you can you direct
people where to go for that sure Unreal
Tournament comm it's really easy from
there you can download the game you can
join our forums you can get involved in
the process we're doing this whole new
thing that's completely open community
development so anybody can get involved
just by playing just by reading just by
participating or they can dive in full
bore and start modeling and programming
and designing and doing all the things
we want to leverage the power of
everyone to really make this the best
game that we possibly can so Unreal
Tournament comm for more information on
that of course gamers Nexus tonight for
the full article and we will see you all
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
