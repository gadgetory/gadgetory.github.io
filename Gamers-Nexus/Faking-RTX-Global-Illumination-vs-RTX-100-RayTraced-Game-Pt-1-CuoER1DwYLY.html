Unreal Engine 4 which just added DX our
support officially last week as a result
of the support we have the first look at
Nvidia RT X shadows to show you we have
looks at graphics with all our TX
features enabled path tracing versus ray
tracing comparisons multiple reflection
bounces off objects roughness
comparisons as they relate to
reflections and deep dives on
traditional graphics techniques to fake
realistic visuals versus their
ray-traced counterparts and untold side
of the global illumination comparisons
has been that there are traditional ways
developers can fake GI without DXR
that's not to downplay DX our today's
video will show you how these standard
graphics methods of faking GI you can
get pretty close but the method NVIDIA
has been pushing and Microsoft's that
the XR is sometimes easier but resource
expensive I'll be joined once again by
Andrew Coleman our lead video editor and
3d artist who created all this tech demo
in Unreal Engine I'll be talking about
global illumination specifically in
today's video before that this video is
brought to you by be quiet and it's
straight power 11 series power supplies
the straight power 11 PSU is shipped
from 450 Watts up to a thousand Watts
accommodating most of the gaming PC
build requirements you'd encounter and
focuses on delivering a higher quality
power supply that doesn't sacrifice on
efficiency or stability noise is also a
heavy point for the straight power 11
using a 135 millimeters silent wins 3
fan that can spin as low as 200 rpm for
quieter low load operation learn more at
the link in the description below and as
a quick example of a global illumination
directly is doing to the room we can
show gloom illumination is on currently
and then global I'm just gonna call it
GI Chloe illumination is really long
this is GI off so you can see there's no
light bouncing off from the floor onto
the bottom of the object which is why
it's difficult to see yes this is a bad
example we'll talk about this more later
in the video yeah this is it's Y
metallic objects are not good examples
of global illumination so quick for note
for all of the other demonstrations we
have coming up will be showing those in
videos after this one like
elections will be showing shadows things
like that but in this one it's our first
demonstration we'll show you a room
that's commonly referred to as a Cornell
box it demonstrates global illumination
and the the kind of key point here is
that gee I can be faked this is not
unique it's not new to touring this has
the global illumination has been in
games
it's just that touring has the ability
to execute GI with real-time ray tracing
instead of fake methods and we'll be
showing you those so this representation
is actually a recreation of Nvidia's
original demo from the RT X launch we're
going to use it to demonstrate RT X on
vs. off and if we look closely you can
see that global illumination is sort of
emanating colored light off of the walls
and onto nearby services including onto
the floor from metallic ball the demo
Andrew and I have talked about before is
flawed in several ways it's and videos
demo but we're just recreating it to
match them so Andrew what are some other
ways we can tell this is global
illumination
I guess he already mentioned the light
reflecting off onto the objects you can
also see it reflecting onto the floors
around them yeah we should we should
mention this so these lights on the
walls I think we agree that they're not
really the best way to do this demo so
the the important part of a Cornell box
that there's one or that all the lights
in the room are just white colored so
all the color coming onto the objects is
just bouncing off of the walls
themselves not directly from the light
source right and the reason we have
these colored lights here is because
we're just matching on videos demo which
we have a whole different video on why
we disagreed with this technique to
demonstrate it we don't need to go
through that all again today
you can check the previous video for
that but it's it's still fine we can
still do the demo here so global
illumination to do one quick primer on
this I guess the main thing we're
looking at here is the light from the
ceiling especially in your more
traditional sample on the right side is
providing all the light to the room it's
hitting colorful objects like the walls
and then that light projects onto the
services of objects nearby and it is not
for example ambient occlusion I think a
lot of people saw Metro Exodus where
a lot of the time the scenes are just
darker and that's from GI it's it's not
like a difference in a oh right yeah
that has nothing to do with ambient
occlusion right and so we have some AO
in the corners of this room like in the
where the wall walls meet and you can
change that separately and Unreal Engine
if you want to do but that is not GI is
it actually is there an advantage to
using DXR if you really try so if you're
a developer and you genuinely try hard
to make GI look good without needing RT
extra DX r the question is can you
achieve a similar look with a similar
amount of effort and so we actually
showing this initial demo we kind of
bait and switch to you guys this is
traditional global illumination it is
not raytrace global illumination and our
point is that you can sort of match DX r
GI with standard game graphics
techniques that sort of fake the
lighting there are a lot of shortcomings
to this will show you those as well and
this Cornell box is the one on the left
is a bit flawed but we'll ignore that
for now as well so despite looking
really convincing there are still
downsides and we'll cut to a shot of the
true DX r version if we haven't already
versus our fake and editing but let's
just not label them for a second so that
you can just kind of take it in and
figure out for yourself which one you
think is which one of these uses DX r
and ray tracing the other one is our
fake so we'll put labels on those now
post below if you guessed correctly and
so Andrew can you explain first let's
walk through we can walk through how you
made the fake or maybe or do you want to
cover first the shortcomings of the fake
which do you think is more I think the
latter is more appropriate the way to
make this is pretty straightforward it's
like a few checkboxes you say do you
want global illumination yes
and then you say how many light bounce t
one say like three or four I don't know
but then you also did some stuff like
you you have versions of this where
you've baked shadows into the floor
right yeah and into the objects if you
toggle your flashlight you'll I mean
they still behave like shadows but but
they're baked in so if you have a
non-static object that's a flaw I baked
all of these aesthetic objects so the
the lighting on the ground is assuming
that they're not going to move but then
after that I told the agent they can
move and so you can see that also you
can see that the global illumination is
also baked into the ground right and
there are other ways to do this too like
is this current example we're looking at
is this using the light mass option yeah
so that will only mostly affect it when
objects go start to move like this it
shouldn't have effect objects that are
static anyway but and so yeah one of the
bigger upsides one of the I guess
easiest way is to fake GI is if you do
have a bunch of objects that won't move
like a bunch of furniture for example
that the player can never interact with
non destructible environment then you
can get from what I've seen you do the
last few days you get pretty damn close
to dxr GI
if not more or less exact except it's
just it's stuck to those static objects
right so nothing's calculated after
runtime it's like it's basically like
the engine is painting underneath what
it the accurate lighting physics
calculation and then just as like okay
that's that's it yeah that's that's what
it is so then are there ways I think you
can still kind of get I saw you do one
demo where you have the shadow still
following the marbles I guess yeah
with a non DXR version but where they're
still downsides to that approach an
important thing to note is that all of
these are actually unreal engines new
rectangular lights
I think they calculate shadows a little
bit differently because none of these do
have shadows but if you bring them over
to the the point light that we have they
do cast moving shadow right so it might
just be a limitation of that specific
type of light
sure so yes so clearly our fake is
pretty good here but if we switch over
to a demo with DXR we can show us some
of the advantages and and just to be
clear here the point of this video isn't
to pick a side of DX our verse is not DX
our does I think it's been kind of
unfairly beaten down by some of the
community and there are very fair weight
reasons to
to criticize the XR and r-tx but one of
the oddest comments I've seen and it's
regular unfortunately is ray-tracing is
a scam our ray tracing is a hoax which
is just sort of comical kind of clarify
some stuff for the audience ray tracing
has been a thin for decades at this
point and in terms of computer graphics
so ray tracing is a thin real-time ray
tracing is kind of the the new thing
that they want to do ray tracing is used
commonly in movies you like Pixar movies
for sure we used it in our intro logo
render so the thing to be critical of
with RT x and z XR is not that ray
tracing is a scam it's that is this
present implementation of the different
technologies feasible to render on the
existing hardware in real time while
still looking good like at least as good
as the fake graphics so that's what
we're really looking at and in the DXR
version that you've pulled up in the
engine here we can see some of the
upsides and downsides the immediate
downside is performance everyone knows
this side of the story so performance
objectively gets worse with DXR on RT x
right now we know that and then another
downside visually as I'm seeing a lot of
noise so do we know what that's like do
we know firmly the story behind this
amount of noise so in order to get a
proper resolution for an image like in
order for enough bounces to hit a
surface or a pixel in order for there
for in order for the noise to go away
you need it depends on the scene but in
an outdoor scene maybe like 500 ish
samples per pixels and if you're trying
to do an indoor scene or there's light
only coming in from a window and it has
to bounce multiple services and render
limited light right yeah limited light
and one source and many places for the
light to rebound off of surfaces you'd
probably need around like a thousand to
two thousand samples for a clear
resolution and right now this is only
running it to two samples per pixel
before well I think the rectangular
lights are set to six and the global
illumination is it to two
I mean two versus six when you're
talking a thousand who cares they're
running a denoise er that helps resolve
images a little bit faster but you can
tell it's not great still yeah has some
interesting latent effects like I mean
you can see them again or if you shoot
you'll see following the ball there's
like ghost balls following the Khans can
have fun with that one
so upsides though if DXR we've we've
seen clearly some of the downsides look
at some of the upsides you give a
balance here you can see the shadows are
now accurately following the objects we
do have global illumination in those
shadows we have global illumination and
in the Cornell box right the interesting
thing about DX R is that nothing has to
be baked before runtime everything just
operates how the lights would expect to
in real life physics although I'm sure
they're doing some kind of optimizations
that are different from real-life
physics yeah of course but if it's close
enough then yes sir we're calculating
here and as opposed to having a pre
calculated right which would be what
baek's lighting is and again you don't
have to necessarily bake it into static
objects I guess we have some examples
where you can fake GI with dynamic stuff
as well just they're still shortcomings
with that but with with D arcs are I
mean what's your kind of opinion of the
accuracy of the GI with this versus your
your baked version like do you think the
the pre baked lighting do you think is
significantly outdone by the real-time
ray-traced
so you asking and if in terms of quality
in terms of how realistic it is they're
seeing that compared to the static
objects yes static objects if we ignore
the dynamism that we want with the XR I
would say it's pretty close it's up that
takes like five minutes to do it before
you start the game right it takes it
five minutes to do it
what I don't like while they're building
it yeah yeah which is an important point
because if it's taking that amount of
time to calculate it then obviously
that's not real time so at one frame
every five minutes I don't think is an
acceptable metric for anybody
except for Xbox players but beyond that
I the real-time or if we look at
dynamism you know you look at a dynamic
scene instead of a static scene how do
you feel then obviously it starts losing
some accuracy so now we're loading in
another demo and this is a preview for
some of the stuff will show you in
videos coming up this rotating logo for
example as raytrace reflections yes and
it I believe and this is a whole
different topic we're not going to talk
about it today but so just some tech
demos we've built with all these DXR
technologies to show what nvidia is
trying to do and here's another I guess
Cornell box yes and it's a bit different
this time so what's going on here
basically this the same thing is going
on it's if you can see it on objects
that are moving on their own and see how
it affects different sides of each
object things like that even that's
shadow on the ground so we're still DXR
is on right now so the shadow on the
ground you can see is you know green on
the green side and spit darker on the
not green side yeah the object rotates
it gets some light cast on it that's
color of the wall next to it and yeah
it's just we're just showing a dynamic
object which you couldn't achieve this
and play the same quality I think with
your favorite art right
yeah it depends there's you can set
objects to be movable in global
illumination but it will do a better
calculation if you said it's a static so
here's our rasterized version you want
to talk through the differences of this
one versus the other
yeah so actually it's it I was pretty
impressed when I saw the rasterized
version of this the weird thing only is
that there's no shadows anymore on the
movable objects once again might be
because of that this is also using a
rectangular light these two rectangular
lights so might be a limitation of that
but you can see that it's still somewhat
dynamic the sides pretty good so we've
still got some some GI in here and this
can be done at a pretty high frame rate
without DXR r-tx but you do lose like
you said the shadow quality for exam
all right actually that has me curious
I'm just gonna do this really quick yeah
I'm going to change out the rekt light
for a point light so I made a little bit
of a mistake I didn't make this light
bright enough so it doesn't look exactly
like the last scene but you can see that
there are moving shadows no just because
it's a point light right so this is the
shadow thing we were talking about was
more result of the specific type of
light and Unreal Engine but you can tell
it since these are movable objects
unreal did not bake the lighting
information into the textures of the
object right yes so how does when you
bake the lighting information into an
object it does it effectively they
rebuild the texture and apply it to the
UV map or what is yeah so there is a
thing in each object called a light map
movies they're called generate light map
TVs and unreal cannon to either do that
from your own UV maps or it can make one
for you and then that's where it bakes
the lighting detail information right a
UV map should we bother going into any
detail on this let's just do a really
short version it's like UV maps are a 2d
representation of a 3d object so it's
kind of like think about how you would
unwrap a face Hey
okay let's go let's shift it to a shirt
if you're trying to make a shirt as flat
as possible only one plane then you'd
have to cut both sides down the middle
which is how they sell the better faces
way back there there are examples of
like faces on like 3d objects I have one
of those of my face
haha tres it's a great example though we
can show on from I'm sure we can find
some on line but yeah there's your
primer of UV map time for different
different day but anyway yeah so change
the type of light did add some shadows
and but the DX our version of GI still
has some upside such downsides to of
course noise and performance point
lights are kind of weird in general
because they always produce well
necessarily true I was gonna say they
always come from a an infinitely small
point which is unrealistic but you can
change the source radius okay so you can
change how large right the light should
be calculated from so what about the the
white probes you're showing me what
let's let's demonstrate those each of
these little points says like okay from
the top angle I'm receiving this amount
of white light from the bottom angle and
receiving this amount of green indirect
lighting so these B's all calculate
indirect lighting in their little
specific point in space and then when
objects get close to them they can say
okay I can sample lighting from a 360
direction onto this surface here right
object in this instance is that red ball
yes be clear so so I guess the the probe
is used as it relates to the as relates
the proximity of objects nearby the
probe can be used to calculate the
correct type of or correct color of
light being cast onto that object right
correct color and intensity right and
this so it is it correct to say them
that this gives you more flexibility and
having dynamic objects yes because now
you can move the ball around the Cornell
box and as it moves around the box
you're still gonna be able to sample
it's just it'll be from all these
different light probes yes so you can
see that this might be because it's
erecting there like once again there's
no shadows at all but the lighting is no
longer baked into the ground but yes so
this is this is another just to be clear
this is not DXR right now right which is
pretty obvious if you've seen the noise
and the other ones but so this is
another fake light probes allow it to be
a bit more dynamic and still have
accurate global illumination without
needing ray tracing let's see if we can
get some are we trying to get some
shadows in here now yeah just some quick
so then in order to just kind of
eliminate a variable here we're you know
are we getting rid of the rectangle
lights or just overpowering them okay so
these are these planes on the ceiling
art art do the light they're just for
show just to show where the lights
originating from but they don't actually
illuminate and he actually cast shadows
yeah right so I think any to there's
some checkbox or some shader setting
someplace to accept lighting from
emissive objects that is not turned on
but I don't I don't know where that is
so just one more quick light bill to get
the see how it calculates the shadows in
global illumination for the movable
objects and how it recalculates the
indirect lighting for the light probes
we've changed the light types let's
let's kind of briefly what are the
downsides to the light probe approach
that we know of because clearly it seems
like it can fake GI pretty well
so it's got to be a downside versus DXR
which is we think may be performance to
some extent right but we're not really
sure how much generally you should
always use light probes in your scene
from what unless you're going for a
non-photorealistic approach but if you
want indirect lighting then light probes
are the way to go okay okay so now we
have changed and to just change the the
type of light to what is it a point
right now yes these are still wrecked
lights but right and that's still
matching that videos demonstration which
we'll talk about in a minute so what's
going on now now it looks like there's
some shadows as opposed to previously so
we have some some shadows now then and
and nothing baked into the floor and
nothing baked into the objects either
yes so this is a this is still a fake
approach not a bad one though um let's
just we mentioned earlier that this on
the left was Cornell box is flawed and
as we said earlier this is just choppy
and what unbid eeeh made for their
demonstration we had a kind of a rant
previously where I believe I said I said
I think it's a little misleading and you
said it's very misleading yes so the the
demo on video showed just bring it back
up was one example was basically none of
these traditional global illumination of
facts really implied like or none of the
fakes applied I think right and then
they also introduced a whole bunch of
weird things into the scene where like
wasn't it wasn't it the scene of one of
them had like the glass marble and the
reflective ball and then the other one
didn't have those things or something
yes so this is actually a this is an
exact copy yeah this is their original
one it's up with the faked lighting this
is their what they changed it to right
so on the right side
they say this is before this is DX this
is our TX off right that's what they say
yeah which leads you to think this is
traditional lighting well I say this is
our TX on our TX does not change the
material of the object right and so that
is extremely misleading but and it's
kind of sad because they don't need to
be misleading to say like hey this
technology has some promise we've
already demonstrated that right they had
another example with that Quadro card in
the room and that are ticks off and on
demonstration was actually pretty
accurate yes yeah I don't know why they
didn't that was like near the end of
their presentation though also yeah I
don't know that it was pushed public or
not but yes so anyway reasons that it's
flawed other than changing the material
the objects on the left right comparison
is also you're dealing with the colorful
lights on the walls and the whole point
of the Cornell box is what is it you
have a single light and the top that's
white yes it doesn't need to be a single
light but what a white light I guess
right and so adding colorful lights and
if we look at the left scene it kind of
looks like there's GI in places that
it's actually just there's a colored
light right so it's like it's really
just it it defeats the purpose of the
demonstration and also using a metallic
object is flawed for this too because
what we're seeing is reflections right
position to GI elsewhere it's very
difficult to see GI in a metallic object
because it just bounces off well I guess
technically even a diffuse object will
be also bouncing off the light like this
one over here this is technically a
light bounce even though you see it
directly on the object but for here do
you see it
the bounce is so sharp that it's just
reflecting the image of what it was
right reflecting because it's mostly in
real life GI and reflections are the
same math it's light bouncing off of an
object that just the surface changes how
that light bounces off and you can also
see it in this metallic surface how
little changes between the two yes just
to illustrate why this is a bad way to
demonstrate GI and you can also see why
these colored lights are not a good
example of global illumination because
it is changing the color of the shadows
but not because of indirect lighting but
just because the direct lighting is a
color and here's the lack of global
illumination with ray tracing so it's
not appearing in the mirror but it does
appear on the objects and this is a
limitation I guess it might be an Unreal
Engine thing I have pretty sure it's
just a limitation of Unreal Engine right
now oh we should also point out that
we're using Unreal Engine 4.20 to
preview too so this is not the final
release of 4.22 so they might add more
things and they've already added lots of
things since the first preview like
multiple reflections right things like
that so also global illumination was not
in the first preview also yeah all right
so that's it for our GI demo hopefully
this gives you some more information
work with than just the the Metro
execution there's a lot to this story
here and clearly as we've demonstrated
you can fake GI pretty well if this is
one of the biggest points you want to
get across global illumination itself is
not new it is not new it's r-tx is not
unique to RTX you do not need our TX to
do global illumination in fact a lot of
games already have global illumination
baked in but or faked in other ways but
RT x and t XR have some unique up sights
that are worth considering here and
we've demonstrated those as well so just
want to give you a look at that we have
demos and examples a lot of technical
explanation coming up ray tracing of DX
r RT x shadows i believe we have we can
do some path tracing versus ray trace
demonstrations and roughness compares
some things like that so definitely
subscribe if you're not we have more of
these coming up and let us know what you
think below of our game does this look
like something you'd want to play
because I mean I think that IGN would
give us at least a seven out of ten
which on their scale is about it too so
thanks for watching subscribe for more
