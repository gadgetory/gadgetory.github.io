Nexus and I'm joined by Steve with your
weekly hardware recap AMD launches the
r9 380 x which is a fully enabled tong
of GPU it uses the same GPU as the 285
and the 380 but instead of coming in
just under 1,800 cores it actually has
2048 that's right so on the previous
GPUs a 285 in the three haiti wet chart
it's not quite a rebrand it's more of a
refresh there are now 20 forty-eight
chords previously at 1792 because Tonga
was kind of locked and the 380 x is a
230 dollar MSRP GPU but the board
partners the AI bees will sell it at
about 240 250 depending on if they're
pre overclocked or not so that is out
there and it should be available for
purchase soon if not already we've done
the full benchmark it competes directly
with nvidia's gtx 960 and you can check
the full review on the channel on the
website if you want to see the numbers
however forms in general the 380 x is
one of the best and the cards i've
tested in a long time which is good
because they've needed that the next
major news item is Nvidia's at pascal
GPU which is a pretty big deal for GPUs
we've been stuck in the 20 nanometer
range for a while now in terms of the
fab process the node the process node
and this is moving down to 16 nanometer
FinFET process we'll just something
we'll discuss later in a deeper article
the pascal architecture introduces hbm
version too high bandwidth memory
version 2 which is capable of a capacity
of 16 gigabytes up to 32 gigabytes even
but the main limiter there is candy
manufacturers of that memory being
Samsung hynix and those folks actually
produce the yield necessary to achieve a
32 gigabyte capacity with hbm version 2
yeah AMD previously lost a fury X is the
first GPU with hbm at four gig with
about half the throughput of what
they're currently boasting with the
Pascal architecture yeah so the new
Pascal Ark is looking to be about one
terabyte per second throughput which is
pretty impressive insane
nvidia officially takes design works VR
and game works vr out of beta these are
meant to help with development and
performance in virtual reality with
NVIDIA claiming up to fifty percent
gains that's right so that is the big
news for gameworks and design works we
are which gamers has been a little bit
of controversy lately but overall it is
an nvidia assisted way for developers
Unreal Engine in particular to try and
build their support for day one
readiness with virtual reality
technologies sapphire is published a
software tool enabling you to over volt
their fury GPUs right so with the fury
GPU is including the fury X the r9 fury
fury nano all of those when they first
launched you could do some limited
overclocking and even if you forced it
through afterburner some memory
overclocking but there was no over
volton available which was a big problem
because you can only push the fury X
from memory in my testing about 50
megahertz that's really not going to get
you more than five percent more FPS and
games over volton will allow the
stability needed to overclock higher
which means better performance claims
from and the cards that are overclocked
and over bolted and this ties in with
claims made by antes Roy Taylor on
Twitter previously who said that the I
think it was something along the lines
of just wait for over bolton or for
proper overclocking tools so they're
here now we don't have to wait anymore
and we can try and test it out publish
some more stuff on that once once we've
got our hands on it AMD is bundling star
wars battlefront with the are 93 GPU
this promo is going to run from now
until January 31st and codes have to be
redeemed by februari 29th the r9 fury is
the only GPU eligible for this promo
right now fury x no fury nano and we've
already benchmarked star wars
battlefront unfortunately not with the
Furies because we have them on loan but
we have the other AMD and nvidia cards
in that benchmark on the channel on the
website if you're curious but that is
all for this week's hardware news recap
