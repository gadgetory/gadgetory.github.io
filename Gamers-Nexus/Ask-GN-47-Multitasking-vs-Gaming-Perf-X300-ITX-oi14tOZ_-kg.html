ask GN if you have questions for next
week post them in the comment section
below
there's a good deal of them lately so
it's just not possible to get to all of
them but I will do my best to get to the
most interesting ones that I think I can
actually answer before getting to this
one this is brought to you by our
patreon backers you can go to
patreon.com/scishow Feud like to help us
that directly we have a new overwatch
GPU optimization guide that is a preview
of what our next patreon goal is because
those graphics optimization guides while
really fun and very insightful for how
the game works are incredibly time
intensive so check that out if you are
interested we've also got a merch store
that'll be up sometime the next week or
so and I'll make a separate announcement
about that and another ask Jen so first
thing to point out I've got some really
good questions this week I also wanted
to bring some attention to our
benchmarks in Andromeda I know that
probably a lot of you are not remotely
interested in Mass Effect Andromeda for
various reasons even because it does not
interest you or because you read the
initial reviews or saw donkeys video
either way there is some cool data there
that's worth talking about so one of
those things was we had some frame time
plots we showed 30-second versus 122nd
benchmarks and sure that they are more
or less identical for the metrics that
we required for the testing so the
duration really didn't impact anything
30-second testing it was just fine there
we also show the impact of various
locations in Andromeda and how
planetside versus Nexus versus tempest
changed the performance which is thanks
again to our discord patreon members
because they provided a lot of savegame
files to accelerate that process first
question is from zeta who says and this
was from the discord as well as ada said
I'd like to let me let me preface this I
have reworded his question because I
believe it was about four words and then
extrapolated the meaning based on the
context so the question was basically
I'd like to know if the heatpipe count
or service area matters more for an
cooller for example and assuming all
else is equal is more are more heat
pipes better of a smaller size than
fewer heat pipes of a larger size so I
sent this along to VSG of thermal bench
it is a thermal specific website I've
worked with VSG a good bit in the last
few months or weeks on various
benchmarks the guy knows his stuff I
believe he's a post doctorate researcher
and uses really high-end thermal
equipment that 90% of people in the
space have no access to so the guy knows
his stuff
I sent my question to him I'm gonna read
his response here he said oh man this is
an excellent question the diameter of a
heat pipe does two things one influences
the available service area of contacts
with the fin stack for heat transfer and
then two influences the volume bulk of
heat transfer from the cold plate to the
fin stack where the specific thermal
conductivity is on a per volume basis so
the number of heat pipes versus diameter
of heat pipes plays into both hands and
as you mentioned the third factor is air
flow restriction this should not be as
big of a factor relative to the air flow
restriction from the fin stack so if you
ignore it then it comes down to what CFD
or computational fluid dynamics
simulations for heat sources that say
are the best way to go
in practice there isn't any real
difference between four six millimeter
pipes and three eight millimeter pipes
for low heat loads we see and that would
be in computing and this is especially
so on GPUs where more thinner heat pipes
are adopted to increase contact surface
area also the use of the exact type of
heat pipe ends up being more of a retail
availability and pricing thing than
anything else but to answer the question
I would say more thinner heat pipes
where the fin stack is small would
probably be the way to go so there's
your answer that is from VSG of thermal
vents Thank You VSP for helping out with
that one a pretty interesting stuff
great question and it looks like for a
as he said a smaller fin stack which
that would just be the actual you know
aluminum block on top of the heat sink
there's your fin stack for a smaller one
of these he is suggesting that based on
theory thinner heat pipes would be the
way to go now a big note here for this
question when I posed it to him I said
you know we have to make a lot of
assumptions so let's assume that the fin
stacks are the same when we're comparing
two units so we have two imaginary heat
sinks in this scenario one has four six
millimeter pipes and the other one has
three eight millimeter pipes so that's
our scenario for that scenario we made
the assumptions that one the fin stack
is the same it is the exact same and two
the fan is the same three the cold plate
is the same and also has the same design
so some of them have those mirrored flat
surfaces and some of them you can
actually see the heat pipes and even the
cracks between the heat pipes which is
where you have the biggest potential for
inefficiency in your thermal transfer
because when you have those air gaps in
there that's why we have thermal
compound as as I've explained before
that thermal compound and I can even see
it on this unit which was used ages ago
and cleaned it's still in there
that's because the point of Tim is to
fill the air gaps whether they are the
microscopic imperfections or the bigger
cracks between heat pipes because that's
where your air warms up and creates hot
pockets within ya know relation then
that cold plate so very good question
and again thanks to BSG for helping out
with that next question is sir papa who
is somewhat of a regular says question
for the next ask GN or an idea for an
entire episode which is the direction
where you can add up going how does
multitasking affect game performance if
I have a few chrome tabs a stream Skype
discord steam and battlenet etc open at
the same time is my performance affected
much maybe see how Rison can combat this
with its many cores so we did definitely
see this question we've thought about in
the past so I brought this question up
to Patrick Leith and when we were
talking about the options for the show
and he has been helping with all of the
CP benchmarking lately he wrote the 1700
X review that's on the site so he's got
hands on this stuff
we of course in talking on this were
immediately facing the the challenge of
methodology and just execution in
general the test because you look at
this stuff and the methods used to get
accuracy test to test when you're
starting to introduce a whole bunch of
things especially webpages it's it's not
going to be easy to make sure
everything's consistent one run to the
next so yes we see your question and we
have some ideas for it we've
brainstormed a bit one thing something
like even chrome doesn't really hog CPU
resources when it's idling so if you're
running an exclusive fullscreen you're
generally not gonna see a whole lot of
CPU resource consumption by Chrome the
one outlier there would be something
like twitch or really any streaming
service and in that scenario if you're
still streaming stuff other than maybe
music while you're playing a game and
exclusive fullscreen on a monitor it's
probably because you have two monitors
so when talking about Patrick I think
the way to properly do this and do it
justice would be a multi-monitor setup
unless we wanted to do some kind of like
windowed mode gaming which I don't
really like that idea so we would
probably have to go multi monitor
because otherwise Windows is just gonna
stifle all of those tasks in the
background that aren't being used when
you're exclusive full screen to another
application in theory there's some trick
places where that's not true
particularly with some webpages but
that's generally how it should work
so multitasking isn't really
multitasking if you're exclusive full
screen and battlefield one for instance
and you've got Excel and Word open doing
nothing in the background so to do this
justice will do multi monitor the next
thing is what what tasks do we use the
test so because we're mostly doing this
or exploring doing this as a user
request it was a popular one I would
much rather hear from you all what you
would like us to investigate for use in
this benchmarking as the
other tasks aside from gaming so leave a
comment below I will have a top-level
comment that's pinned to the top of the
comments thread reply to that one and
tell me what kind of things you want
open in the background while we're doing
tests and use the assumption that we're
doing a multi-monitor setup so you're
gonna you can have the game here and the
other stuff here the one thing we're
looking into immediately would be
something like a stream now to do that
you have some complications you have to
make sure that the amount of data being
received is the same in the processing
being done by the browser is the same
and by the CPU of course as a result we
have a solution for that already
brainstorm that one up earlier so that's
not gonna be a problem streaming is one
thing excel word I don't know if really
those would be engaged so let me know
what you think that is more of a user
request at the end of the day but yes we
absolutely see your question and I've
thought about it so it's a possibility
next question Omar Baja says when a
company is signing the same exact GPU
with different factory overclocks for a
price premium do they have the same
overclocking Headroom parenthetically at
neglecting silicon lottery or are they
bend I'm asking about the normal I'm I'm
asking about the normal not like me
known to be bend kingpin cards in my
case I'm specifically looking for the X
of X 480 GTR 1 version runs 12 88 the
other 13 38 for a $20 price premium so
there's another one where I wanted to
pitch this to manufacturers because I
thought this you know this is a good
question we've kind of addressed it in
the past but in the past when I have
addressed it it's been just based on
information I've collected and I wanted
official responses this time so we
reached out to EVGA in Asus because they
were most immediately available to us
for before this video so I asked EVGA
inside the same thing to them if you
sell all these different SKUs let's
ignore things like kingpin are they Bend
how are they Bend how do you do that
process EVGA said that more accurately
they do pre testing they didn't want to
use the word bending and I actually
agree after following through the
process
so EVGA does a series of tests to make
sure that bass and boost reach a certain
minimum and their tests for bass are
particularly abusive for something like
the FTW series and so they'll they they
will pass a high percentage of the cards
that might be FTW targeted but the ones
that do not pass the minimum bass and
boost test will not be given that higher
ski brand name instead something on the
same PCB would end up with the DT Series
if you're familiar with a DT series
that's basically what that is it means
that it can still overclock pretty well
and they were telling me a lot of those
cards still the same Headroom as the FTW
cards but they won't have the same high
bass or boost pre-configured clock
because they were failing and again the
abuse of synthetic tests for for
validation to make sure the product
should be wherever it is ultimately
going so they call it pre testing in
that regard and they also said a high
percentage of them will pass and become
the target card like FTW evj will mount
the GPU to the board so you have to do
that you buy the GPU from Nvidia they
ship you a whole bunch of chips you
build or buy the boards
in the case of these cards it's build
some of them might be reference boards
but these aren't and then you take the
chip you take the board and you put them
together you assemble the card
effectively and test it so they do that
that determines the testing determines
which skew within the boards available
skews it will become FTW DT or otherwise
we asked if they ever tried to test the
GPU and find that it's so good they want
to pull it and put it on a different
card like kingpin and they said that
they have done that in the past but it's
a huge amount of work and it's kind of
risky because when you're dealing with
BGA mount things desoldering it
effectively and putting it on something
else is not a trivial process so this is
a quote from Asus they said it's not
really bending per se as you have to
test the chip to understand the
differences not only in clocking
capabilities but also temp ranges at
those clock speeds so pre testing and
this was in response to my question is a
good way to say it that said you will
still have the chip lottery in some
cases as even after pre testing for a
certain clock or temperature level
there's still some headroom that occurs
which is why you had a GTX 1080 that
maybe did 50 megahertz over the pretest
Oh see that another one might get you
100 megahertz over for example those
very top chips we do a separate pass on
for our ROG cards like matrix and
Poseidon and in talking with them
further about this they're basically
saying that there was our og cards that
matrix Poseidon and otherwise go through
a whole lot more validation and so
because they go through more validation
they get a higher skill they're sold for
more and theoretically they at least
will be sold at a higher reference or a
higher base and boost speed if not
actually boast a higher overclock
potential there with Pascal as we've
seen that's not too exciting so that's
how EVGA and ace used to it I asked a
whole lot more questions and they're
waiting to get on calls with the Taiwan
teams at some point this week or next
and then they'll get back to me so we
might have more of that next question is
from Sam the man who loaned us his Titan
XP several months ago Sam says how does
it rise and chip binning at work I can
barely see a difference when overclocked
in all three of the r7 lineup so what's
different apart from the price tag is
this to do with ASIC quality you know
that's an interesting question
when we did our r7 1700 review which was
largely positive especially coming off
the 1800 ex review a big reason that
review was was seemingly so much more
positive than the 1800 ex review is
because our r7 1700 effectively
invalidated the existence of our 1800 ex
and that's because it can clock the same
or even higher in some cases but that's
just the chip lottery as Asus was saying
so the fact that you could achieve these
higher clocks if you are an overclocking
type did kind of raise some questions
and with the 1700 X it was even more
questions because it's it's dead in the
middle of a weird range where the 1700
can do what the 1700 X can do with all
the stuff that's out in the first
production
pretty reliably there's a good chance
you can at least hit 1700 ex stock
clocks and therefore achieve 1700 X
performance because there's really no
other difference of note so what are the
differences then well first of all the X
the X denotes a wider XFR range for well
XF are I guess redundant extended
frequency range for the 1700 X and the
18 or X processors as far as binning I
don't have a hard answer for you and the
thing I'm most curious about is what
happens after this first production run
so to phrase that question basically if
our 1700 today can do 4.0 gigahertz and
achieve the same performance as a 1700 X
or an 1800 X even when they are
overclocked what's going on in the
future where these things might get more
binning based on demand in the market so
a 1700 today the ones provided to us we
bought one and we had one provided to us
by Andy those today could be bend down
chips where they were potentially
dropped into a lower skew to fill demand
where they could have actually passed as
something like a 70 under tax or an 18
ordered X in terms of validation and
this kind of blends in with a previous
question as well because these are all
the same architecture same r7 everything
it's just the skew is different the
clocks are different so then your
separation comes from two things market
demand and meeting it and validation in
other words did the 1700 that we and the
are selling for cheaper fail validation
to be an 1800 X chip and if so we we
mark it down we saw it at a lower clock
so I don't know how that works in the
will work in the future I don't know how
they're doing it now and I'm not sure if
anyone does if you've seen a store it's
great please supposed to blow like an
official actual source but if a concern
there is the 1700 we can recommend
pretty easily today but in six months I
don't know if those things are actually
going to be lower performance overhead
for overclock and then they are
depending on how they've scaled those
initial shipments so the answer
unfortunately to your question is I
don't know how the rise and bending
works there's been some discussion of it
online but I don't have anything
official for you and so I'm not going to
try and guess as for the differences
again their ends is between the three if
you're overclocking it's not a whole lot
other than basically silica mater and
apparently how your temperatures are
read which will have old thing on that
separately so yeah hopefully that
answers that basically our current
suggestion as of today is if you are
buying rise and probably get a 1700 and
overclock it and be happy and save $200
or maybe a 1700 X 1800 X doesn't seem
worth it unless maybe your IT department
won't let you overclock or something
like that and wait which case that's
exiting core audience for us so next
question is from Ethan Lachlan who says
will EVGA make an AMD video card no they
will not the only reason I'm bringing
this back up is because I'm still seeing
it in a lot of video comment sections
just because you can rearrange the
letters EVGA into V eg a test not mean
EVGA is making an ante video card in
fact we spoke with EVGA CEO not too long
ago probably back in February just after
CES during the icx launch and he told
all the press in the room very proudly
that he has never stepped foot into a
meeting with AMD that was something he
was very proud of so I think we can
firmly say that they're not making a
vega card next question is a short one
Orion agape says where are the am 4 X
300 motherboards we talked about this in
our 1800 X review the delay on those
mini ITX boards with X 300 and similar
chipsets is because they're complicated
to make so 4 X 300 specifically in
speaking with some manufacturers who
make the boards those have an extra
layer of complexity literally in that
you have to have an extra PCB layer to
pull things off at least for this
particular vendor we spoke to in a way
that was satisfactory again to that
particular vendor so that means that
there's more lead time to actually end
during this thing and that I would guess
is why there's a delay next question the
last question out of Acts says can you
do benchmarks with old overclocked 2600
K 3770k and compare them to your stock
sixty seven hundred and seventy seven
hundred K and gaming benchmarks to show
how feasible it is to overclock your old
CPU to compete with the new ones I know
my 4.8 gigahertz 2600 K outperforms a
stock 700 K and CB Z's benchmark I would
like to see how they can compare and
real gaming benchmarks stay tuned
we already did those tests Patrick's
articles written I'm soon turning it
into a video and adding some stuff to it
so that's going to come up soon the
3770k is not in there but the 2600 K is
in there and we did overclock it I think
to 4.7 gigahertz so it's pretty close to
yours and we have a stock 6700 K so
you're in luck exactly what you asked
for has already been done
we'll probably be online next week
