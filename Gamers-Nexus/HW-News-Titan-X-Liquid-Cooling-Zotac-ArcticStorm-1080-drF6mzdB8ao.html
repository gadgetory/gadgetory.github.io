with a quick hardware news recap for the
last few days there's two graphics card
news items with water blocks basically
then a micron news item 3d v-nand that's
pretty interesting stuff before getting
to that this coverage is brought to you
by i buy power and the new elements
gaming PC with LED lighting underglow
and a large tempered glass full window
so the first news item is zotac gtx 1080
arctic storm and this is a full coverage
water block on agt x 1080 as one would
expect it includes the card and the
water block you connect to an open loop
system that you've already gotten your
computer and it has all the standard
fittings so you should be able to
connect it with pretty much any open
loop system on the market right now
there's support for inner diameter
tubing up to 10 millimeters and then its
standard G quarter inch threaded
fittings for the the actual connections
the cards got a backplate I'm not clear
right now if that's aluminum or another
material copper for the cold plate base
plate and again it's full coverage of
water block and we don't have a price on
it right now but it is called the zotac
gtx 1080 arctic storm and connects to
open loop systems also on the video card
front aquacomputer now has a Titan X
water block this is interesting for a
few reasons that you'll see probably the
next week or so from us their new
products aqua computers product is a
Titan X water block you by the block
itself not the card you put it on your
card if you already own the twelve
hundred dollar solution and it's another
open loop cooler so you plug it into
your open liquid lube open loop liquid
solution and it pumps through it's not
like an all-in-one like you soothe the
hybrid cards or the Seahawk the
interesting thing with this aquacomputer
one is it uses ten millimeter thick
copper it's electrolytic copper and
thermal compound applies to the vram as
well as the GPU die as usual so it's got
full coverage of the vram and the GPU
keeps everything pretty cool you don't
need the hybrid solution where you have
a vrm blower fan and there are two main
variants of this solution there's the
copper one for a hundred euros don't
have USD just yet and a nickel plated
one for 115 you can also buy a passive
back plate which really is just a back
plate as always for 25 euros extra it's
a CNC machine block and it's a jet plate
with again complete coverage of the card
and the last news item for today is
microns at new 3d v-nand orn and for
mobile devices so you've all heard of 3d
NAND or v-nand as some companies call it
Samsung of course one of the most
prolific and the probably the originator
I think of that technology on the
consumer market you've heard of that for
ssds this is the same idea but for
mobile devices microns that new 3d NAND
it goes up to 32 gigabytes making it
among the largest storage solutions on
the market for mobile especially it's
stacked cells vertically as with any
v-nand and it's also the smallest die on
the market at 60 millimeters squared
making it a good fit for the mobile
phone market that it's targeting and
this isn't microns attempt to diversify
their market holdings and get away from
just systems computers because obviously
it is a shrinking market on consumer
enthusiasts is growing to our
communities defense but shrinking
certainly and consumers so they're
trying to diversify into mobile makes
sense intel has tried it in the past and
has had mixed results and microns NAND
will be interesting to see sort of
camera performance and other high data
throughput performance applications on
mobile devices because the demand is
just it's going to be faster it's dense
at 32 gigabytes and we'll see how that
goes it's not I don't know if it'll come
to consumer at all from micron but
Samsung has some new 64 layers stacked
and and as well we'll talk about that in
the future so that's all for this quick
news recap for the week or for the last
few days anyway as always patreon link
