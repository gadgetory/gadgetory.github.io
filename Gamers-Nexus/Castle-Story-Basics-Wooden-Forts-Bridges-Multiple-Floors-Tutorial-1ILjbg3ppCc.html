Nexus Donna and we were playing some
more castle story prototype version of
castle story I should say and I'm going
to do a quick tutorial on how to build
wooden structures like this one over
here which is it's kind of like a
Lincoln Logs design really and we will
also talk about wooden bridges and when
they are applicable and stone bridges
like that one on the background back
there so as you can see I have built
this very simple wooden structure and
it's kind it's kind of cool you can make
a watchtower or something so the main
thing though with the structure sorry
sorry for sipping back and forth the
main thing is that you can make an
elevated floor so the elevated floor or
the ceiling in this case the roof is a
little bit tricky to make just because
the way the prototype functions right
now so let's go ahead and just make one
of those so I can show you how to
actually lay those out these can also be
used in your castles if you would like
to build a multi-story castle so do you
keep that in mind if that's what you
alternately plan to do first you need to
place down the the support beams they
can be no more than six spaces in
between or seven apart total one two
three four five six that's the
in-between in-between section and we'll
do seven so now my floor can be could be
six across using planks there will be
three planks and the middle section as
you will see must must be filled in
after these side sections are three four
five six okay and then last one there we
go so pretty simple right you just find
some flat ground and place those down
now we need some cross beams to support
them to support the actual planks that
is so let's find the
come on game come on let's find a place
to let us put some of those down easily
sometimes the game does take a bit of
fidgeting as it is a prototype so keep
that in mind as well you may need to
they're exactly like that you may need
to move your blocks around a little bit
just right click to rotate and then
it'll eventually find its spot there we
go so we need to do that on both sides
come on there this game up yeah there
you scam is like it's like an
accomplishment even clicking on things
sometimes but it's still fun and it's
worth it you know we asked for a
prototype and we got one let's we can
fill the third one and now you can't
fill the middle section in until these
side sections are complete so as with
the planks that is true with the beams
now we can place down the planks long
ways preferably and the easiest way I've
found to click on this because you'll
see it kind of goes all over the place I
just click exactly where I want to put
it you angle the mouse don't angle the
plank itself so let's let's put these
down where they belong if I could get
some interaction there come on
there we go okay like everything else so
click on the sides of the planks to put
down more next to them and fill that
whole space out we're going to do that
on both sides
once this is done we'll fill in the last
row which will of course be more planks
and in the middle so I'm going to go
ahead and place these down after this
we'll move on to the the wooden bridge
which is quite simple it is useful for
connecting multiple structures if you
don't want to use stone like if you want
to make a fortress out of wood because
that's kind of cool so if you want to
connect them you can use actually a
wooden bridge out of logs which will
need to be built from both sides but
it's pretty sweet the if you build a
stone bridge which I will also briefly
go over you don't have to build it from
both sides you can build it from only
one side making it ideal for for
connecting two islands that you have not
yet connected with so stone bridges are
much easier to to use in that regard but
we will go over both so now that we have
that done your next step of course is to
fill it around with stones and make a
sweet castle or whatever you want to do
okay our next part of the tutorial is
building a bridge so you can see I've
cleared out a bit of the forest I also
had to reload the game because it was
glitching so we are going to build a
pretty simple bridge right now it is is
there are a couple different designs the
first one I'm going to do is just using
let's build a little closer just using
these types of logs the vertical columns
and we will put a sort of base board
there and then you can build them any
distance apart from each other
I'm going to go with one two three four
five six seven just sticking with our
our sixteen
and let's get these Britt Ron's building
so basically this I like to use these
between between the wooden structures
although you can also use them to build
to other islands so let's say I wanted
to build
I don't know over to that Island I
suppose be much easier to pick one of
the same height but you would probably
you would be able to use a catapult to
launch someone to the island and then
build from both sides as is necessary
with this structure however the stone
structure again will get by that we need
to play some here just like our previous
are elevated floors you can also use
planks for this but I can't stand planks
because they are quite hard to work with
so I'm going to stick with these and
obviously this isn't really elevated off
of anything but it is a bridge
nonetheless so for all of our purposes
you can see how it works and that's
going to be the bridge layout we can
grab a trusty brick drawn here judge B
joob joob G I don't know what his name
is so okay we're gonna he's fighting me
to go back to work but that's how the
bridge works so now you can make your
own brick Tron Olympic training course
or something I don't know and here's
what our applied concept looks like this
is our bridge with two of these
structures that have the elevated floors
or ceilings and I have a I have an
improvised bridge here I ran into
problems they weren't quite far enough
apart I thought they were six barp they
were only five so I ended up doing a
kind of cool pass-through bridge it's
actually more like a gatehouse now and
I'm very happy with the results so we
can see here this is I'm a hit delete to
get rid of that rubble this is what we
ended up with and it is a pretty cool
design all right now for the final part
of our tutorial I'm going to show you
how to make a quick stone bridge that
does not require brick sean's on both
sides and we see here I have actually
deleted part of my bridge to show you
this we are going to use the
arches and the stairs and a couple of
normal bricks so first of all you just
find where wherever you are starting it
doesn't matter if it's on the ground or
part of a bridge already you place the
arches on the edge just like that you
can line up stairs of course if you
would like to actually be able to reach
them and well you can reach them any way
but it makes it a bit faster and then
you just keep on doing that until you
eventually get across now of course you
can also put normal bricks here just
like that you can also use logs of
course if you'd rather have a straight
bridge but this is indeed one of the
easier ways to do a stone bridge and and
then of course you can curve it down on
your way on your descent to the other
side so once you reach kind of the
halfway point you can just arch it the
other way of course you will have to be
on the the other side to properly do
that so that is that's pretty much the
design for a stone bridge hopefully that
helps if you have any questions at all
again please post them below and that's
it for this tutorial so please like

and ask us for other tutorials if you'd
like to see them and I will see you guys
