500p with generous usage of packing tape
on the front of the case and that was
for two reasons one it no longer really
comes off like it used here so we've
resolved that problem then - as far as
air flow goes the actual reason for
doing that was to create an extra maybe
half inch to one inch spacing from the
front of the chassis to the back of the
front panel which would resolve some of
the issue of those front 200 millimeter
fan cowlings bleeding into the mesh area
for intake where previously it was
restricting air flow further then the
case has already restricted by usage of
its acrylic panels obviously in addition
to that we've got some testing for
radiator placement so we did radiator
placement testing we did cooler testing
for different fan configurations within
the case and then we have a special
project coming up either it'll go up
either before this video or just after
that should also interest you with this
case before we get into that this
content is brought to you by the
Thermaltake flow RGB closed-loop liquid
cooler which is a three hundred sixty
millimeter radiator plus three 120 fans
that are RGB illuminated the if then
we'll take it rain fans at that this is
a 4.5 done a detect pump which is one of
the faster pumps you can learn more at
the link in the description below so for
the cooling problems in this case a lot
of it will really all of it comes down
to the fact that the front panel is
closed off we had some testing we can
put the chart up now from the initial
review where we showed that removing the
front panel improved thermals in the cpu
benchmarks by something like 10 to 13
degrees Celsius and again that's because
you've got this massive 200 millimeter
fan that is exposed to zero air it's
getting air only in through the sides
they're not particularly strong and
static pressure to begin with and then
only a small percentage of the blade is
actually ever exposed to the air anyway
because once the air goes in there it's
basically immediately being sucked into
the case it's not like there's just a
bunch of it it doesn't have enough
exposure to outside air hence the
improvement in thermals when we remove
the panel and part of this comes down to
a general rule of thumb with
air-pressure speaking with some thermal
engineers in the industry we learned
that generally speaking you lose about
30% pressure for every 90-degree turn
that you make so not the best in terms
of pressure and really not leveraging
the actual 200 millimeter surface area
of that fan to access air so yeah
radiator test and we'll obviously
perform better because you can pretty
much resolve any thermal issue with
water it's not the best way to solve a
problem it's a brute force way to do it
but you can get the case in a better
positioning relative only to itself with
air so compared to more open cases this
is still not going to be the best
obviously with liquid and a more
breathable case you're still gonna be
better than liquid in this one but we
can get it to a point where it's
reasonable now there are a couple of
different radiator orientation options
here and this is a question that's
really commonly asked we've received it
a lot for ask yen basically the question
is where is it best to put my radiator
in my case and the answer is it depends
entirely on your case and everything
else so this test applies only to this
case keep that in mind when we tell you
that the radiator is best in a certain
position in this case don't run around
saying oh the radiators best in this
position in every case that's probably
not true so just keep that in mind this
is something new we're doing radiator
placement guides on a per case basis we
will probably only do it for the most
popular cases if you want to see more of
them tell us in the comments of the case
reviews but let's roll onto this one for
now
starting with radiator placement testing
and I'm moving on to the fan testing for
airflow we're using the new EVGA at 240
c LC as i stand and for the top versus
front mounting tests this measure is
both GPU and CPU thermals throughout the
process because the fans are such a
major selling point for this case we've
tested a few different means of
leveraging them including relocation the
idea is to attempt to keep the original
fans when possible though we did run
some modified tests for academic
purposes where we got rid of the fans
the EVGA pump and fans were set to max
rpm for these tests as we're really just
looking for consistency here not optimal
noise performance and the CPU voltage
and frequency were also set to their
usual fixed values although radiator
position
testing is really only comparable to
this one case some of the concepts will
apply elsewhere but the specificity will
remain stock to the age 500 P before
getting to the first chart here's a
listing that defines our test
configurations for radiator placement
the first is top mounted 240 millimeter
cooler with the fans pushing from the
inside of the case to the outside with
both 200 millimeter fans and the
original rear fan in their original
positions
the next is front mounted 200 millimeter
fans stock followed by the 240
millimeter radiator followed by the
radiator fans and a pole configuration
so the fans are pulling air through the
radiator with the 200 millimeter fans
pushing air onto the radiator and for
the third configuration we're looking at
front mounted 200 millimeter fans with
the radiator mounted internally on the
inside of the case with a gap between
the 200 millimeter fans on the radiator
as if you couldn't fit the radiator for
example in the front fan bracket the
radiator fans are removed in this test
using only the 200 millimeter fans for
cooling the rad the next has
configuration is a front mounted 200
millimeter pair of fans with the
radiator mounted between the chassis and
the fans so they are flush against one
another with the radiator fans still
removed and the final test is a top
mounted 200 millimeter pair of exhaust
fans with a front radiator using the
EVGA fans in a push configuration with
those fans inset into the case rather
than the original protruding layout
these tests are conducted with our
thermal torture scenario which places
both the GPU and CPU under 100 percent
power virus workloads here's a results
chart we found that the CPU thermals
performed best when the radiator was
positioned between the 200 millimeter
fans and the stock EVGA fans configured
in a push-pull setup with 200 to 120 s
this brought our CPU temperature to 45
point 8 Celsius delta T over ambient
with liquid temperatures at about 14
point 7 C over ambient the GPU meanwhile
suffers a bit we're up to 57 C over
ambient now with an ambient of roughly
22 Celsius that put us as nearing a DC
for the GPU diode temperature not far
from throttling this is what the twin
froze our coolers at the 55% fans
which is about where Genia coolers tend
to max out their fan profiles you could
obviously drive this temperature down
with a faster GPU fan rpm but it may be
better to just build things differently
testing with the radiator flush against
the 200 millimeter fans but with the
EVGA radiator fans removed we end up
with mediocre CPU and GPU thermals the
GPU isn't suffering as much for this one
but the CPU temperature has increased by
about 13 degrees Celsius with liquid
temperature of about 7 degrees Celsius
the radiator fans were obviously doing a
lot of work here and getting rid of them
means that we lose some of these static
pressure advantage of smaller fans right
up against the radiator for the final
front mounted configuration the radiator
had a gap between the 200 millimeter
fans with no radiator fans mounted we
found this to be the worst configuration
pushing the CPU toward 67 C over ambient
or nearing ADC accounting for ambience
and that's about where an air cooler
would put you so obviously not a good
idea the GPU is still quite warm here as
well running with the radiator in the
front with EVGA fans pushing and with
the 200 millimeter fans moved into a top
exhaust position our numbers output as
59 C over ambient for the GPU and 47 C
over ambient for the CPU
although decent for CPU temperatures the
top exhaust fans are pulling the air
away from everything else in the case so
we lose any dissipation potential we had
over the GPU backplate or anywhere else
on the GPU it seems that the best
configuration is to configure the 240
millimeter radiator in the top with the
fans pushing up and out and then to use
the 200 millimeter fans in their stock
front intake position this results in a
51 point eight degrees Celsius CPU
temperature and 50.5 C GPU temperatures
over ambient that's ideal because our
CPU and GPU numbers are now closer
reflecting a better balanced cooling
design besides we want our GPU as cool
as possible
a CPUs performance won't change much
from an extra 5 degrees Celsius of heat
but a GP is boosting performance we'll
moving on to air tests we're switching
back to our original core frozer cooler
that was used in the review and using
some slightly changed data analysis
method so these numbers are not directly
compared
two previous tests with a stock
configuration tested onto our new method
we are measuring sixty four point five C
over a mid for the CPU with the GPU at
fifty three point four C over ambient
remounting the panel with a makeshift
0.5 inch spacer by way of tape allows
the mesh to better align with the front
two hundred millimeter fans but doesn't
help enough we're still at about sixty
three C over a mint on the CPU or 51.5
on the GPU that's a drop of about two
degrees for what it's worth but we can
get a bigger drop by fixing cm's choked
off front panel by either removing it or
using inset fans if you remember from
the review the two hundred millimeter
fans protrude outward enough to kill
half of the ventilation usefulness we
installed two nfa fourteen fans and
fixed them to the same decibel level as
the two hundred millimeter fans
obviously this is not a perfect
comparison because we're using different
fans with different specs but we're at
least at the same noise level as the
stock cased fans were and in terms of
price they're pretty expensive as well
so they're close in price and a noise
level at this configuration this ends up
with way better cooling for the CPU that
was worse on the GPU due to the
positioning of the fan you could do a
bit better by moving it down more than
we did but you do lose some of that
airflow over the entire GPU service area
which the GPU actually benefits from the
CPU temperature falls to 59 C from sixty
four point five C with GPU temperature
rising seven degrees as a result of the
more limited airflow over the cooler in
the least the more directional airflow
of a top 140 fan is outperforming the
200 millimeter fans at the same rpm so
the primary takeaway from the radiator
side is more or less what makes sense
now we see a lot of people doing front
mounted radiators on cases because
technically yes it's going to be better
for your CPU thermals but there's a lot
more to a system than just CPU thermals
and this case the way it's laid out
there's not a really a good intake for
air to get to the GPU if you mount your
CPU cooler to the front because now that
radiator is obviously radiating heat and
the fans are pushing it straight onto
the GPU so it's not really getting cool
air plus we found with cases that have
power supply shrouds like this one they
tend to have a significant
worse videocard thermals than cases
without them and that's just because
it's restricting your airflow and how
much air the GPU actually has access to
the fans can actually utilize which
particularly matters with a dual axial
cooler like this one so we would
recommend and this would apply to two
forties and two 80s and three 60s for
that matter for when they fit we would
recommend generally trying to keep your
CPU cooler in the top as exhaust because
when it's under liquid anyway it's
probably not going to be that hot and as
long as you're reasonably below t.j.maxx
you're not losing anything from the CPU
not anything tangible as a user anyway
what you will lose is if you have it
front mounted and you increase the
temperature of the GPU by five to ten
degrees Celsius at which point you've
got potentially more limited boosting
Headroom which Pascal is extremely
sensitive to that and AMD Vega is as
well and you also have potentially if
you resolve for boosting Headroom
allowed or GPU fan and those are gonna
be smaller fans that make more noise
than the front that whatever's in the
front at the top so we would recommend
top radiators if you're doing something
like a 120 or 140 we didn't test that
but just speaking from experience I
would probably do a rear mounted CPU
cooler because the heat coming out of
the video card should more or less be
taken care of by the 200 millimeter fan
to the front you're gonna disperse most
of that alternatively you can do a top
mount for 120 or 140 but at that point
honestly just whatever looks better but
as far as air flow try and get more cold
air to the GPU it's struggling the most
for using us a tower cooler like this
one still going to have problems with
vertical GPUs obviously as we showed in
the original testing but you're already
decently well off with the stock
configuration except if you felt like
doing the change I suppose you can move
these two fans up here as exhaust and
then set something up in the front as
intake that's more directional now we
did plot higher GPU temperatures in that
one instance we tested but you could get
a position a bit lower and would
probably be fine it's not really worth
doing though
ultimately this case the way it's built
is to show off those fans that's the
reason to buy this case they're really
expensive most of the cost so you
probably don't want to move those to the
top they don't look quite as good but
hopefully that gives you an idea more of
a radiator placement guide than anything
else the rest was just kind of out of
academic interest and we do have another
content piece on this one either out or
coming out soon so keep an eye on that
where we're gonna fix the case that's
the goal here so thank you for watching
