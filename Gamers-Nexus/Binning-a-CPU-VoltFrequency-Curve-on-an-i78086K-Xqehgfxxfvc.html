frequency scalability on our 8086 kay
one last time this time coverage
includes a manual bending of our cores
as we already Illustrated limitations of
the IMC in our overclocking livestream
the major takeaway with these bintu cpus
is that we can sustain a lower voltage
and therefore lower power and thermals
at a given frequency but there's a bit
more to it than that before that this
video is brought to you by Dollar Shave

companies at popular shave butter body
wash and wipes and also includes a solid
high-quality razor and a full set of

essentials starter kit for just $5 and

below it's quick overview here we
already have a stream recap if you're
interested in that go check it out or
check it out when it goes live in a day
or so after this we also have a video
talking about the thermals the power and
the noise considerations of the 8086 k
what we're doing now is looking
specifically at the volt frequency
binning so at what voltage is a
frequency stable or at what voltage is a
frequency incapable of being held stable
for whatever the benchmark is so the two
applications we're using today are just
blender and fire strike and the thing
with these applications is blender does
AVX work loads so it is somewhat
comparable to prime95 a really popular
stress testing program except with
prime95 you can adjust the FFT size now
with smaller F of T sizes like 8 by 8
it's extremely abusive on the core and
it's great for finding a points of
failure and an overclock but you could
also just do the most intensive
application you're likely to use in
daily use and that might be something
more like blender which is still intense
is still ABX
but it's not nearly as stressful for the
CPU as 8k F of T's and probably 95 and
ultimately if you're trying to really
make sure it's never going to crash yes
prime95 is a great way to do that let it
run for a while see what happens but
what we're doing is keeping it realistic
today so blender and fire strike are
good fire strike does not require nearly
the
voltage for stability that's something
like blender or prime required because
it's more of a gaming application it's a
synthetic game functionally so fire
strike service is a great stand-in for
what kind of voltage we require at a
given frequency for the 8086 k when
gaming what we're also going to be doing
finally is looking at just some rough
scalability at stock at a 50 X
multiplier 51 52 and 53 and then also we
have a 5.3 5 gigahertz clock that we
achieved in the stream so that will give
us just a guideline for how much
performance you can expect for each of
those multipliers when overclocking
something like a high-end Intel CPU so
last note here before we get into this
keep in mind that the voltage
requirement to keep a given application
stable changes based upon the
application and what kind of workload it
creates on the CPU also keep in mind
that this voltage if it goes higher to
sustain a frequency in an application is
going to require more power it's going
to output more heat refer to our
previous 8086 K video for that it's a
great study on how the processor thermal
and heat load behaves and how it can
impact your noise levels to a factor of
2x when you are dealing with those
higher voltages to sustain higher
frequencies and eventually you want to
meet a middle ground where you get a
decent volt frequency table without
being too abusive on the CPU or on your
noise levels so we'll start with blender
today this is a great example for just
bending the Vote frequency in an
application that actually is something
we can use
so it's not like Prime in that way keeps
things simple for blender all of these
our requirement is stable for 30 minutes
for the most part if a overclock is
going to fail it will fail on that 30
minute window almost always now if we
were selling these CPUs like a company
like Silicon Lottery does we'd want to
run it for a whole lot longer than that
probably on a an order of hours but for
realism sake in terms of completing
these tests we chose 30 minutes because
we know 99% of the time if it doesn't
fail in that window it won't fail so
keep keep that in mind
either way start with blender we found
that in blender
5.1 gigahertz at one point three five
volts was stable whereas as you'll see
in the fire strike table in a minute we
were able to hold 5.1 gigahertz with a
slightly lower voltage depending on what
we were working with four parameters we
have a couple of other blender numbers
here for volt frequency requirements and
you can see where we finally stabilized
and stops for this one fire strike is
where we spent the most time low so
let's move on to this fire strike right
away for fire strike this is a lot less
intensive than AVX workloads like
blender prime but more important for
competitive benchmarking purposes and
fire strike most impressively we were
able to sustain 5.0 gigahertz at 1.30
volts which was sustainable during our
live overclocking stream as well we
later verified a stable prolonged period
of fire strike physics testing with the
same configuration so it did survive for
30 minutes and this is functionally a
stand-in for gaming it illustrates just
how well bend the 8700 ka CPU performs
and that's ultimately what an ad 86 is
our 8086 K holds 5.0 at 1.30 to 1.35
depending for a fire strike whereas the
8700 K s holds 5.0 gigahertz at one
point four zero to one point four five
in this case depending on which CPU it
is that's the bigger takeaway here at a
given clock we've reduced our voltage
requirement significantly five point one
gigahertz also held at 1.30 but only for
long enough to run the 30 second test it
did not survive the longer burnin we
next found a 53 X multiplier to be
stable at about 1.3 9 volts which is
impressive when considering at most 8700
KS could never reach 5.3 gigahertz
even with high-end cooling you need
exotic cooling for that that's even more
true now though because most of those
higher-end 8700 KS would now be removed
to become 8086 KS we were unable to
stabilize a 54 multiplier under any
circumstances including per core
overclocking we were however able to
sustain a 101 BC LK shown to the left of
most column with a 53 X multiplier and
1.41 volt this gave us a 53 50 megahertz
core clock at one point for one volts
pretty impressive for purposes of fire
strike physics it would appear that the
optimal performance the thermal and
power configuration would be roughly 5.1
at one point three to two 1.35 volts
with our specific CPU and as always this
will change based upon the individual
CPUs none of them are made equal you'll
also see an LLC column here in our notes
the ACE use of Maximus export it seems
to keep a fairly flat voltage provision
for V core when at LLC level six which
is what we want going to LLC level seven
was sometimes necessary but it tended to
over provide voltage when spurious
delivery became problematic so you'd end
up jumping and voltage in a way that
could be damaging if you're using your
CPU under a 24-7 overclock with the
voltage you think is lower than is
reality
moving on finally to scores for relative
scores and scaling we found the
following results across our 8086 K
frequency testing firestrike spat out an
eighteen thousand and seven score for
the complete baseline test that's stock
with only XMP enabled clocking trivially
the 5.0 gigahertz in one point three
zero volts got us to twenty thousand
nine hundred points an increase of
sixteen percent with about thirty
seconds of work from a seven hundred
megahertz or so bump in the clock we
next observed only a one to two percent
increase in score by overclock in an
additional one hundred megahertz up to
five point one gigahertz our five point
two gigahertz overclock at one point
three five volts yielded an increase to
twenty one thousand seven seventy three
points an increase of 21% over the
baseline of eighteen thousand from
earlier at five point three gigahertz in
one point four volts we observed an
increase to twenty one thousand ninety
two points hitting diminishing returns
now another marginal hike over the
previous hike to five point two
gigahertz each 100 megahertz increase is
at this point
hitting diminishing returns and we're
not individually gaining a lot but it's
still measurable and it's repeatable by
jumping to a b c lk of 101 which
increased the memory frequency and also
impacts other things in the system we
ended up at twenty three thousand to
twenty three points a big jump but a lot
of that is from the bc lk increase and
therefore the frequency increase and
just general responsiveness in the
system going to be c lk 101 with thirty
six hundred megahertz memory at CL 15s
and now we've improved a lot of things
at once including an uncor to fifty two
we had a final result of twenty three
thousand seven forty five points so
going back to the discussion then our
CPU bend out to basically have
definitely stable 52 multiplier for the
uncor which is great we haven't tried
higher yet we are definitely say about
53 50 megahertz for the core and then
for the rest of this scaling once you
get into the five gigahertz range beyond
that there's not a huge impact for fire
strike physics and that will correlate
actually better than most games well if
you compare fire strike physics to games
the correlation is semi linear to a
point and the point at which it stops
being linear is when you start adding
more cores because fire strike is a lot
more responsive to more cores and
threads than most games actually are but
because the core count on the 80 780 86
remains somewhat reasonable for a game
to use the scaling is fairly comparable
and from that we can draw a rough
conclusion and we'll look into this more
later if we need to but it's an 8700 K
all over again so same idea
Jarre rough conclusion that at 5.0
gigahertz if you can keep your voltage
and therefore power and therefore
thermals way lower it might be worth
just running out that in which case you
could buy an 8700 K roll the dice and
hope that it's a 5 gigahertz chip and a
lot of them are but the ones that are
4.9 you're still not losing a ton going
up to 5.3 is fun it's good in terms of
having something to do and telling all
your friends you got the best one but in
terms of performance unless you're
competitive about it like fire strike
overclocking competitively or something
like that
you're not gonna gain a ton of extra
framerate out of another hundred
megahertz or 200 Hertz or whatever it is
but when you're talking 400 500 700 like
we're doing here in some cases that's
where it definitely becomes noticeable
this of course also reduces render times
and applications like blender but not to
the same extreme that increasing the
thread count would do because it is a
more thread intensive application in
that instance so that's it for our 8086
k bin that's what we ended up with
that's how our CPU performed we actually
just got another one in that we paid for
for another purpose a build that we'd be
talking about in about a week or so
