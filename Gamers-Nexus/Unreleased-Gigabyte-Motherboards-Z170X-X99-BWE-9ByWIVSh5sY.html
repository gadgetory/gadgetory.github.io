motherboards shown here at PAX East 2016
including some x99 boards in preparation
for the broad well II launch sort of a
refresh and then some of the good old Z
170 boards now brand as Z 170 x before
we get to the specs on these boards and
their target market price points and all
that note that all this content from pax
east 2016 is brought to you by
CyberPower who make the fain book laptop
that we recently overclocked past 4
gigahertz so a couple things here the
five boards in question there's three in
the x 99 set up and those are the x 99
design air or designer ax is when i call
it the x 99 phoenix sli x99 ultra gaming
and then that's two from z 170 x chipset
families and that is the z 170 x
designer and z 170 x ultra gaming part
of gigabytes existing family for gaming
motherboards the surprise here at pax
these 2016 these are actually unreleased
right now there's still engineering
samples so everything you see is
unfinished and could change but the main
item on all these boards are at least
some of them is the youtube connector it
effectively is a connector that provides
the MDOT two PCIe speed and it's
combined with the drive mounting
flexibility of the old SATA drive so
that gives you a couple of things but
one of them is that you can have
basically as many YouTube drives as your
motherboard has you got two connectors
the u2 connector makes physical drive
location a lot easier because the drives
actually resemble more closely the 2.5
inch SATA drives that we have now except
the interface looks less like typical
SATA and more like SAS gigabyte showed
us a few boards with the you two
connectors and the first is an x 99
board the GA x99 designer ax which
induce introduces the designer label to
the gigabyte family it is one of the two
new ultra durable series boards and it's
got an amp up audio with two of the new
on board you two slots and you can see
though is sort of near the SATA ports
over on the side of the board the x 99
designer e x has five full-length pcie
slots the first second and fourth our
wire
for x 16 the third slot is x 4 and the
fifth is by eight or x 8 the ga x9 I on
of Phoenix SLI board is part of the g1
gaming series and that is one of the
brands of gigabyte and this board is
similar in some ways to the designer EXT
x99 board previously it's got amp of
audio as the previous board did it has a
single you 22 connector now two of them
with just one and it's in the same
location as a previous board the final
x99 board is the x 99 ultra gaming and
like the Phoenix it's also in the g1
gaming series it's got only a couple
small differences that are really
noteworthy and one is that the x 99
ultra gaming doesn't have a wireless
card in its iki to em about two slot
it's got one it just doesn't include the
cards you have to buy that separately
the GA is he 17 TX designer is an ultra
durable series board with many of the
features we've already discussed and it
has amp of audio it's got a single you
too connector has an m kede and without
to slot for ssds pcie configuration is
simpler it's more similar to Z 170 board
it's got 1 by 16 slot 1 by 8 and 1 by 4
slots the final board is easy 170 x
ultra gaming which falls a bit more
sensibly into the g1 gaming series it
doesn't have the amp of audio that is
really all to note here from gigabyte
the addition of you two is welcome in a
couple of ways but one of them is that
the introduction new storage devices
does provide some options for higher
performance like with Intel's obtained
which is coming hopefully sometime this
year so that is all for the gigabyte
boards patreon link official video helps
out directly hit the link description
below for more information comments as
always are welcome and I'll see you all
