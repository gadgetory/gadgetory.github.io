hardcore overclocking and today we're
gonna be taking a look at the Asus
zenith extreme motherboard I will be
covering some of the OC features before
we get into all the VR I'm is there's
not really that much on this board so
let's get right into it starting off in
the top right corner the board does have
two you know eight pin power connectors
for the CPU honestly for thread Ripper I
think this is ridiculous
overkill though AMD actually requires
two eight pin like eight pin and a four
pin by specification even though
technically speaking like thread Ripper
doesn't pull like as much power as like
skylake X so even with a overclock as
long as you weren't pushing it too hard
the thread ripper should get away with
just one eight pin without any real
issues now obviously there's no harm in
having a whole extra eight pin but yeah
I think them the this is pretty freakin
overkill because thread Ripper does not
get as power-hungry as a sky like X
before that this video is brought to you
by thermal takes view 37 case the vo 37
focuses on highlighting custom PC builds
with its full panoramic window and
tinted front acrylic and our thermal
testing the view 37 performed reasonably
well when considering its looks focused
build which is partly thanks to the
airflow design and the removal of a
bottom power supply shroud for a balance
of looks and performance check the link
in the description below for the view 37
now under the 8 pins you find a power
power button reset button below that
there's a 24-pin connector and next to
that you find the this four channel dip
switch right here and that is for
enabling and disabling the PCIe slots
and this is basically if you have a you
know say a water-cooled multi-gpu setup
or a liquid nitrogen cooled GPU set up
or you know you're just incredibly lazy
and one of the cards has an issue or
there's some kind of software problem or
for whatever reason one of the cards
like you want to disable one of the
cards without actually physically
removing it from the system
you just flick the
which for that pcie slaw and it'll
disable that card so that's that's a
pretty handy feature in my opinion now
down in the bottom right corner of the
board you also find the sort of the more
advanced extra like extreme overclocking
features so this right here is the ln2
mode jumper this will extend like how
far you can push voltages normally
there's like normally our og boards have
voltage limits that are just kind of
unsafe well once you put the ln2 Jumper
into ln2 mode the voltage limits go from
pretty unsafe to completely unacceptable
so you know you'll never feel voltage
limits and once you move that over and
it's like I'm not really sure why they
do it because it's not like outside of
ln2 mode the voltages are that much more
reasonable under that there is a slow
mode switch next to that there is an RS
VD slow mode basically immediately
pushes the CPU multiplier to the lowest
possible setting very very handy for
basically idling in like if you're on
Ellen 2 this is really really handy for
putting the system into like basically
very low power consumption or just for
stability so that you know in between
fine-tuning settings or in between
opening benchmarks saving screenshots
that kind of thing the system doesn't
crash because you're no longer at 5
gigahertz you're at like a gigahertz so
that's what that switch is for right
there there's also this switch which is
the RSV D and that switch is generally
used by ROG motherboards it basically
has well that switch basically will have
a sort of profile for a whole bunch of
voltages to try removed cold bug cold
boot bugs and cold bug issues I'm not
sure how well that works on Rison on the
Intel motherboards from Asus this switch
is amazing it can make like for a lot of
CPUs you don't have to actually know
anything you just flick the switch and
everything works it skips a huge part of
the fine-tuning process
if if this works well but on Rison
running sub-zero is a lot more
complicated and so I have suspicions
that this might not be quite so flick
the switch to look competent because
even if the switch sets everything up
correctly it might still not work just
because Rison on ln2 is well Rison and
therefore you'll have all kinds of
issues even at the best of times now
next to that you get two buttons now
these are actually useful for even
regular overclockers so this red one
right here that's safe boot this is
super handy if you well basically if for
whatever some reason the system isn't
posting and you don't want to wipe your
bios settings you press the safe boot
button it'll boot the system at stock
settings but all of your settings in the
BIOS will still be like present and next
to that you get a retry button this is
for getting the memory to retrain if
you're pushing really hard memory
settings basically what the retry button
does is it temporarily cuts all power to
the motherboard and that basically wipes
the motherboards training profile for
the memory and the motherboard has to
essentially relearn how to run the
memory and eventually if you're lucky
it'll learn how to run it properly in
your you'll boot like 37 33 CL 12 or
whatever memory settings it is that
you're aiming for and if you're unlucky
it'll just never ever actually get there
even with the retry button but this is
very very handy for overcome for extreme
overclockers if you're really like
hammering the memory safe boot in my
opinion is just handy for everyone
sliding along the bottom edge of the
board you do get this molex power
connector for extra power to the PCIe
slots because of course the 24 pin only
has to plus 12 volt lines and well if
you have for very high power consumption
like high PCIe slot power consumption
devices so like 75 watt 75 watt and 75
and another 75 your 12-volt pins on the
24-pin are gonna go melt down on you
like they're literally just gonna melt
which isn't good so for that reason
there is this molex power connector down
here now personally I'm not a fan of the
molex patent of power connector I think
it's like the worst power connector of
all the power connectors in a computer
this one sucks the most
it also only adds one 12 volt line to
the PCIe slots so if you were doing
something really crazy like say
hammering the reference aren't like
absolutely hammering the overclock on
reference Rx for 80s and four of them i
I don't think this would be enough to
save the 24 pin or itself like it would
just blow up both of them because you
you might end up in a situation where
you have like a hundred Watts going
through every single PCIe slaw and at
that point you'll still overload the the
molex and the 24 pin at the same time so
like that is like an extreme you know
exception kind of case but yeah I it's
just there's other boards that use a 6
pin and I think that's just straight-up
better so yeah and the board has a
postcode it's unfortunately not actually
on the board itself it's integrated into
the heat's while the i/o cover which I'm
not really a fan of but uh yeah it kind
of is what it is as long as as long as
the you know as long as the board has a
postcode I can live with it but I'm not
a fan of i/o shields I usually remove
them because the they cover up the
cooling system so let's actually take a
look at the back of the board and be oh
well erm heatsink is not actually that
much better visible here but yeah the
postcode is buried into the i/o shield
so if you want the postcode but no i/o
shield it'll be kind of awkward anyway
the last feature I wanted to point out
on the back of the board is this hole in
the CPU socket so the
is basically for putting a thermal probe
through the well behind the CPU to get a
well if you're on liquid nitrogen
basically the internal dye sensors stop
working so if you want to see the
temperature of the CPU well of something
closer to the CPU than the Ln to Paul
you need this hole in the socket that's
really the only way to do that so that's
why that's there it's a it's a standard
feature for basically all asus rog
motherboards also interestingly enough
all of the capacitors for filtering the
vcore VRM are located on the back of the
board as well because if we go back to
the front of the board there's you know
there's no space right here to add bulk
filtering capacitors so yeah that's just
kind of an interesting design issue with
with the tr4 socket for thread ripper
because this thing is absolutely freakin
massive so that covers the OSI features
and we can start getting into the you
know V RMS starting with the largest and
the most important one the vcore vrm
located right over here now the voltage
controller is over there and you can't
see it either way that chip is a asp
1405
it's a digi+ power digi+ power branded
chip but it's that that's an asus
rebrand it's probably an international
rectifier three five two zero one based
on the fact that asus uses this same
chip for a whole bunch of very different
vrm configurations all using
international rectifier parts and
there's not that many international
rectifier chips that are relevant
currently that would be capable of
running the various configuration that
asus uses this chip for so it's probably
a three five two zero one but it's like
the the asus rebrand name is the asp
1405 either way it does support one two
three four five six
an eight phase output like we have here
and yeah so this is a true eight phase
VR m4v core and each of the phases uses
a single international rectifier IR
35:55 Asus is favorite power stage so
that is a 60 amp power stage from
international rectifier it's not
particularly intelligent but it is a
very solid part the only thing that's
kind of interesting about this eight
phase vrm really is that this is a vrm
that asus has been using for ages
basically this is the same vrm you would
see on a rampage six extreme a rampage
six apex a rampage five extreme a
rampage five extreme edition ten or
rampage five edition ten I'm not sure if
they drop the extreme part from that
one's name but yeah Asus has been kind
of recycling this power circuit for a
while now and that's fine because you
know there's no reason to fix what isn't
broken and this power circuit it has is
actually really really solid so let's go
through some power numbers for this
thing considering that it is an eight
phase-- with these 60 amp power stages
so for thread Ripper at say ambient
cooling systems you're gonna be looking
so you know air cooling water cooling
you're gonna be looking at voltages of
like one point three five to one point
four two volts
one point four to being the maximum one
point three five being sort of the happy
place where the CPUs cloth-like the
difference between one point three five
volts and one point four two volts in
terms of actual overclocking very very
little the increase in power consumption
rather significant so this is sort of
the the happy medium voltage obviously
this is still gonna be pretty hard to
cool because at one point three five
volts you're probably gonna be looking
at about two hundred amps current you
know current draw by the CPU which
translates to about 270 watts of heat
dissipation which means your
in a pretty significant heatsink but it
is still within the realm of what an air
cooler can deal with and for this
configuration right here the vrm would
produce about 18 watts of heat on the
MOSFETs so that's not a you know that's
not a ton of heat and the vrm heatsink
that the board has especially
considering that there's like a little
fan that blows through the actual fin
stack that hides in the i/o cover that
should be no problem
for one point for 2 volts you'll be
looking at maybe around 240 amps
actually you probably won't even go like
it probably won't even hit that high and
about 26 watts of heat output so again
really not that much this Pat like for
ambient overclocking this 8 phase is
extremely solid there's a good reason
why Asus has been reusing this 8 phase
for like high-end desktop motherboards
for ages and ages and ages and ages it's
because it's good so yeah no problem
handling the thread Ripper for like
ambient daily overclocks especially
considering the vrm cooling situation it
has now if you start cranking it up
though things start to get kind of
concerning but I'm not sure if thread
Ripper will actually pull that much
current at the various settings so
purely theoretical 300 amps 1.5 volts
you'd be looking at about for 1.5 volts
you'd be looking at about 41 watts of
heat that might be a workout for the vrm
cooling situation cuz that the main like
the main block for the heatsink is still
well a block not a lot of fins in that
itself of the most of the actual surface
area is crammed into the i/o cover which
is gonna have kind of restricted airflow
and 41 watts of heat is quite a lot of
heat so I'm not sure how well a little
handle like you know if you're like
benchmarking on a big custom loop well
if you're just running benchmarks they
most like most of them probably won't be
long enough to really cause vrm thermal
issues because it takes time
the vrm to overheat but that that is
quite a lot of heat and it could cause
some issues for extended workloads at
completely unsafe settings for daily
usage and if you were on liquid nitrogen
which I still don't think you're gonna
hit this but the limit of what the
datasheet makes easy to calculate as 440
amps 1.8 volts - you know on the core at
this I don't think even on liquid
nitrogen you're actually gonna hit that
amount of current consumption but if you
did hit that the vrm would produce about
95 watts of heat which is really hot and
concerning that is uh yeah that is a you
know that that's no small amount of heat
luckily on liquid nitrogen this area of
the motherboard should be getting like
frozen through from the ln2 pot on the
cpu and with thread ripper technically
not having a cold bug like you can run
it all the way down to minus 196 degrees
centigrade the main problem is stuff
kinda stops working on the way and you
have memory issues and boo issues and
it's kind of a mess but if you know what
you're doing you can get the system to
run at minus 196 degrees centigrade is
just difficult to actually do that and
if you do get that running well there's
like this entire area of the motherboard
is just gonna start freezing over pretty
quick so the vrm will you know be
starting out at temperatures that are
quite possibly sub ambient and as long
as the benchmark isn't too long this
won't necessarily be an issue though it
is kind of concerning and would probably
over at whelmed the vrm heatsink
eventually so yeah but for you know
normal users this vrm is plenty there's
really nothing you need to worry about
this about like there's no need to worry
about this vrm if you're just gonna be
running at everything you know for a
daily system so that's nice and on
liquid nitrogen well if you did really
like like thread Ripper doesn't hit that
high as far as I know it maxes out
around sort of 600 watts power
consumption it does like it doesn't
really like sky like X is a lot lot
worse than thread Ripper when it comes
to power draw so yeah I don't like I
don't think the vrm will actually get as
much of a workout like it won't
necessarily hit this kind of current
output especially not like that kind of
voltage even on liquid nitrogen but you
know just from a theoretical standpoint
that's what would happen if you did hit
that amount of current at that voltage
that's the V quorum plenty good enough
for what it needs to do moving on to the
next major erm we have the SOC and that
is this group of phases down here
controlled by this chip over there and
that is again the ASP 1405 the vrm is a
one except this time it's configured for
a one to three phase design and the
chips used these guys right here are
Texas Instruments power stages these are
CSD 90 737s and these are rated for
maximum 25 amps output minor problem
here I don't know how much current the
SOC vrm for thread Ripper poles my like
based on what
rynason poles it should be between 30
and 42 amps peak at 1.2 volts
you know as SOC voltage and there's
really no good reason to go much above
that or blight well there is reason to
go below that but there isn't really
much reason to go above that I've not
really seen any improvements with my
CPUs going like significantly over 1.2
volts but uh and I don't have a thread
Ripper system so like just based on
Rison there shouldn't really be much
reason to go over 1.2 here
but thirty to forty two amps and so at
30 amps 1.2 volts you're gonna be
looking at about 5.5 watts of heat and
at 42 amps about eight watts of heat so
this could get pretty toasty especially
considering that there's gonna be like
there's probably gonna be a very hot
graphics card sitting right over the BRM
so yeah these like I'm not a hundred
percent certain about like if I'm happy
with this there's also a good chance
that thread Ripper doesn't literally
pull twice as much SOC current as a
rising chip does and it only like I'm
basing it off the fact that there's to
rise and dies in there so they assured
each pole you know the same amount of
SOC current and there's two of them so
twice as much but if it turns out that
it's not pulling twice as much current
then actually this would be non-issue
because you wouldn't be hitting these
kinds of current levels and that kind of
heat output now 30 amps 5.5 watts I
think this should be non-issue even with
the the GPU situation but that eight
won't figure that that could be a
problematic but really like that I have
no way to tell from just looking at the
PCB here that would need to be tested
but on the flip side I don't think
there's actually any motherboards with a
better SOC vrm out there so yeah it's
kind of an interesting situation in that
way now then let's move on from the SOC
vrm to the memory power which you get to
phase memory power for both well each
group of memory slots so you get you
know one two phase right here split like
that and that's controlled by this chip
and on the other side you get the same
thing that chip and these two phases so
what chip is that that is a another one
of these asus rebranded DG plus power DG
plus power controllers which is a this
one's an ASP L
11:03 I have no idea what that actually
is it does seem to integrate all of the
gate drive for the actual memory vrm so
the two-phase memory of erm on the other
hand I well actually even the two-phase
memory of erm is actually kind of a mess
so the specific the exact MOSFETs that
are used here I can't get the datasheet
for them but they're apparently very
very close in specification to Nyko
semiconductor and they are Nyko parts
like Nyko semiconductor does make these
it's just like a slightly different skew
so these are Nyko PK's well the close
you know
no no PK p ii series PE six one six six
one six B A's are the chip like the
MOSFETs I'm basing the power figures for
this thing off of and Nyko semiconductor
has a terrible reputation because they
make pretty garbage MOSFETs but the
thing is DRAM doesn't need it like dr4
and even ddr3 doesn't really need a lot
of current like a lot of power so using
you know
Nyko small Nyko semiconductor MOSFETs
for from memory power I don't see an
issue with that and there's a reason for
it if you do have for memory stakes
you're gonna be looking at about you're
gonna end up with something like eight
watts for the whole memory group because
each stake is about two watts at most
and well eight watts uh you know 11.35
volts you're gonna be looking at our
average current of about six amps which
with this two-phase vrm translates into
about one watt of heat there's literally
no reason to worry about that at all
like that is that's gonna cool itself
passively just through the surface area
of the chokes and the PCB itself so yeah
this that like that this is another one
of those
recycle asus rog recent lot loves to
recycle their circuits VRMs because
they've been using a very very similar
to phase VRM again for ages there is a
whole bunch of motherboards using
basically this vrm with incremental
updates to which mosfet and incremental
upgrades to the power stages possibly
the voltage controller though I do
believe that they all rain like they all
end up ranging from 300 to 500 kilohertz
anyway so yeah and all of them are
two-phase so yeah that this is another
one of those asus recycles but at least
you know that this vrm works and never
had issues in the past so to sum it up
the zinnias extreme overall solid board
the SOC vrm I'm not entirely sure about
but that's mostly because I'm not
entirely sure about quite how much
current it actually needs to provide the
V curve erm for thread Ripper is
completely acceptable even though this
is like an old old like this is a vrm
design that asus has been running for
literally ages admittedly like there's
been some tweaks and upgrades to it over
the years but its basic like the the
asus high-end mother like high-end
motherboard of erm since like LGA 2011
the original LGA 2011 I don't mean the
haswell-e version I mean the Sandy Burgi
version like the the the the high-end
vrm for those boards has been 860 amp
internet 60 amp power stages from
international rectifier and whatever
voltage controller is relevant at the
time that does eight phases and Asus has
been basically doing that well since LGA
2011 because 2133 2011 - 3 is basically
this 2066
is this this is zenith is this so yeah
but on the zenith this this is
completely adequate on X 299 I I find
this somewhat a concerning but at least
on the thread Ripper like thread rippers
not as bad as sky like X in terms of
power consumption so I don't have any
complaints for the V Corps VR I'm here
memory power is you know stat standard
Asus there are motherboards out there
with much much more expensive MOSFETs
for their memory power but again is like
these you know these Nyko parts are
doing 1 watt you're not like it doesn't
matter if you push it down to half a lot
like no margin of error for most testing
a quote like if you're measuring system
power that's gonna be margin of error so
memory power absolutely no complaints
the feature set on the motherboard is
solid the fact that they decided to put
the freaking post code into the IO IO
cover I find kind of an inconvenient but
overall really really solid board if
you're looking at this thing for a daily
system there's not really anything to
complain about at least that I can see
so yeah that's the zenith extreme
hopefully the zenith 2 extreme will turn
out to be just as good or possibly
better but knowing asus they're probably
just gonna slap the same vrm on it again
unless thread ripper turns out to pull
liked white like the kilowatt audun well
no because that'd be uncool Abul yeah
unless thread ripper suddenly gets a lot
more power-hungry asus is not changing
that PRM for a while so the this this is
quite possibly gonna be a good reference
even against the zenith 2 extreme
because i'd be surprised if they didn't
just recycle all these power circuits
again but again they work really well so
it doesn't really matter and that's it
