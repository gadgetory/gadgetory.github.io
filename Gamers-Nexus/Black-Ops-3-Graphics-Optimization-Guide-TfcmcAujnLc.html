dotnet and this is our black ops 3
optimization guys this is a graphics
optimization guide that aims to help you
in increasing FPS and eliminating some
of the more impactful settings when it
comes to framerate but potentially not
as impactful visually so we're trying to
make the trade-off of where can we
sacrifice some visual fidelity in
exchange for a faster frame rate output
which for multiplayer is the thing that
you want the most of course so first of
all this was published on the website
probably about a week ago now we
published it the day after black ops 3
launched well this is the video version
of that if you need more information
this video will only go so deep with the
detail of options that you can tweak
check the link in the description below
for the full guide on graphics
optimization within black ops 3 but
let's just dive into things quickly here
first of all major note black ops 3 just
put out an optimization patch and that
changes our FPS metrics quite a bit so
these metrics were presenting on this
video are the original metrics from the
day one launch that means that in
general you should actually see
increased performance over what we had
here but the overall Delta that is the
percent difference between settings
sayin off vs. on or high versus low that
Delta value separating the settings the
settings levels should be about the same
even with the optimization patch so
these steps will still help you in
increasing the FPS the first item to
look at is mesh quality and we have all
these settings defined in the article
but mesh quality is one of the ones that
may confuse a few people meshes in games
are sort of in the same line as objects
and textures and all of that in that
they help create the environment that
you're looking at and in some of our
examples we've shown mesh quality is
most apparent when looking at things
like vehicles and complex models within
the environment and bikes are an example
if you look at sort of the background
prefab bikes mesh quality is what
dictates how smooth the model appears
and the level of detail within the
models there might be some items on that
model that are present at higher
qualities but not present at lower ones
like more circular lights or things of
that nature the next setting is texture
filtering which is basically anisotropic
filtering if you're familiar with that
it's just sort of renamed here so
anisotropic filtering is filtration of
the textures it does a filter pass on
the texture that basically aids in how
that texture appears to you when it's
applied to surfaces at different angles
the best example and the one that I use
the most is take a road if you have a
road with a dotted line like a white
dotted line as you'd find in real life
and you're standing as I am and the road
is at this kind of angle to you a
perpendicular angle effectively you're
viewing the texture that applies to that
road at a non oblique angle you are not
looking at it 90 degrees head-on so what
does that mean well as the road gets
further from you and approaches it's a
vanishing point out on the horizon
somewhere as it approaches the vanishing
point the texture without any kind of
anisotropic or texture filtering will
look like it's still applying in squares
it'll look like he gets more blurry and
distorted as the road distances itself
so texture filtering
basically smoothes this out and sort of
makes a more trapezoidal application of
textures as it gets farther away from
you and this normally has effectively
zero impact on performance there's a
small impact in black ops 3 but you'll
see in the article that it's really not
a big deal and you can kind of just
leave it on to the max but that is what
texture filtering does the next one is
subsurface scattering and this is the
base layer of what creates deep
scattering going forward as graphics
advanced in the next year or two but
subsurface scattering is a technology
that takes skin especially face skin and
things like that within black ops and it
changes the way that light cascades and
propagates through that skin layer some
games even now have blood mapping in the
face so what subsurface scattering does
is it effectively smooths out sort of
the cheats with in black ops 3 and
so here's I have the forehead and things
like that and makes those wrinkles and
imperfections in the skin look a little
bit more real by manipulating the way
that light interacts with those very
tiny and fine imperfections so this
changes how the light cascades under the
surface within the skin and that changes
where the light is brighter or dimmer or
what-have-you
when it comes to skin graphics the final
option we're talking about in black ops
3 before just jumping into the
benchmarks is order independent
transparency and within black ops three
order independent transparency is
required for volumetric lighting and
that means that volumetric lighting has
a dependency on oh I T which is what I'm
abbreviating it to because it's very
hard to say order independent
transparency over and over so volumetric
lighting is dependent on oh i T being on
if it's off then volumetric lighting
must be off this makes benchmarking
interesting as you see in the article Oh
IT changes the way that layers of semi
or fully transparent objects textures
particle effects interact with each
other so the the best example here if
you go and I think it's the metro level
I forget the name of it but it is it is
a metro environment and you go there you
can see in the background or in the
distance that there's a sheet of glass
at the border of the level that is
occluding the pillars for a bridge in
the background now this glass is
transparent so even though it's
including it in that it is physically in
front of the pillars it is not occluding
vision to that pillar so you can still
see it the pillar also has a fog in
front of it fog is semi-transparent you
can see through it to some degree the
same is true for the glass that is
semi-transparent so oh I T takes these
multiple layers of semi-transparent
items and figures out which one gets
drawn first and which one occludes the
other and that way you don't have sort
of weird flickering or inaccurate
looking transparent effects within the
game so that is what oh I T does and it
does have a pretty big visual impact if
you're really looking for it but if
you're not looking for it is one of
those
items you can turn off and benefit
greatly in terms of fps without
necessarily having a huge impact to your
gaming experience benchmarking black ops
is interesting because the performance
varies greatly from single player to
multiplayer to freerunning there's a
huge performance disparity depending on
what you're playing and a single player
a lot of that is because they're using
higher quality models more Poly's higher
quality textures and more objects and
all of this environment art it's very
cinematic and has a pretty movie-like
feel to it but that means that you're
taking a bigger hit to FPS so we saw up
before the optimization patch remind you
we saw FPS hit so about 37 to 38 percent
from multiplayer to single-player we did
all these tests you're seeing here in
multiplayer and as because we sort of
assumed that going forward multiplayer
will probably be more popular of the two
modes single-player is important but we
only have so much time
so we benchmark multiplayer and that
means some technologies like subsurface
scattering you don't see the full effect
of because with in multiplayer never
gonna get that close and that much
detail and that high poly face
animations and drawings I'm like in
single-player where it's actually a
pretty big focus so you will see more
impact of subsurface scattering and
single-player you can find RAM and vram
benchmarks on the website we saw a
memory consumption of about 15 point 2
gigabytes commit with a working set of
six point seven gigabytes that means
physical memory consumed six point seven
and then virtual memory plus physical 15
point 2 gigabytes you can find the rest
of that on the site via rams basically
whatever is made available to the game
through the video card the first
critical item to FPS to turn down is
order independent transparency we saw
performance gains of about 13 percent by
disabling oh I T completely which also
disables volumetric lighting so that
doesn't mean the benchmark is imperfect
because we're now changing to settings
not just one this will change the
transparency layering fog interaction
with the environment and players but
will greatly boost fps and that's where
oh I T comes in the most oh i T layers
objects and textures with transparencies
in a way that establishes the correct
distance relative to the camera in our
screenshot that we've shown on the site
you can see this the best with the
bridge and the pylon example that I've
already given
and if you disable it you lose that
transparency layering but you gain about
13% fps oh it's totally off
anti-aliasing is the next critical item
which is really no surprise by moving to
no anti-aliasing from filmic SMA 82x
which is the default setting that we
encountered for our setup we saw an
improvement of 10.3% fps and that's
pretty big contrast to fxaa which some
folks will complain is a little bit
blurry fxaa reduces FPS about 1.5
percent but it adds some level of
anti-aliasing without getting the huge
hit to performance AAA isn't necessarily
that important to multiplayer gaming so
this is one of the first places I would
go to increase your FPS and if you're
wondering what these options are black
ops 3 offers a lot of anti-aliasing
settings including the less familiar
filmic SMA which is also present in
previous Cod games filmic anti-aliasing
tends to create a more cinematic
experience it uses multi sampled
temporal filtration which is t2x so it
takes two samples two taps per pixel and
applies that temporally which means over
time so you're checking one frame to the
next sampling pixels in each frame and
then determining how the antia scene
changes the edges and the color of the
graphics and things like that it reduces
the marching pixels effect in large part
and that is a big hit to FPS so that's
what I'd look at first for anti-aliasing
is changing that high importance moving
down from critical to high is the
texture quality you can see examples of
texture quality in our screenshots and
this game has a massive impact on
texture resolution when you change the
quality there's actually it goes from
legible for very small signage to
completely illegible just a blob of
color and this one is potentially rated
as a critical change in terms of FPS for
users of GPUs with smaller frame buffers
but in general it's about a high
importance texture quality corresponds
with resolution of in-game textures and
lo is so hideous that we'd really urge
you to avoid going down too low we'd
push you more towards medium as a
tolerable
and hardware setting that still grants
you an extra five percent performance
over extra especially with a smaller
frame buffer because extra does consume
a huge amount of video memory and you
can see that Delta comparison in our
chart where it's a couple gigabytes
Delta for extra on texture resolution
ambient occlusion is of medium impact
fps and the screenshots we've
demonstrated will show what ambient
occlusion actually does for the most
part a Oh will embolden points of
contact between bordering services
darkened shadows were necessary and
dictate the proliferation of light
reflection from some materials disabling
AO increases fps by about five point
nine percent which is certainly
noticeable but not as much as the
previous settings and going from extra
to medium it gives a three percent FPS
gamut gain if you don't want to
completely disable it this is the first
place to look after exhausting the
previous settings if you really need
more FPS if you're on a lower end
hardware setup volumetric lighting is
the last setting we're talking about
here the rest you got to go to the
article to get more information
volumetric lighting has about a four
point seven percent performance range
from none too high giving us another few
FPS if absolutely desperate for a few
frames we'd suggest running volumetric
lighting on at least medium as it does
somewhat noticeably benefit the games
overall aesthetic and visuals and
volumetric lighting produces sort of a
fill of light that radiates everywhere
just like we've got fill lights when we
film these videos where you have sort of
one light that fills the room or the
environment with a less intense light
that provides some atmospheric glow
that's what volumetric lighting does so
I would recommend leaving it on to some
level and this is particularly
noticeable with transparent textures and
smoker cloud or fog effects after that
check out shadow map quality then
texture filtering and mesh quality and
the rest in the article if you're really
running out of places to try and gain a
few fps
so that is the black ops 3 graphics
optimization guide we really like doing
these they're a lot of fun to learn
about game graphics and hopefully it
gives you some good information even if
you're not playing black ops 3 it still
teaches what the settings do and as
always if you like this kind of content
the best thing you can do for us is
spread the word
share it tell folks about it and then
hit that patreon link in the post roll
video if you want to support us directly
and creating more stuff like this so
check back this week for some
battlefront content and a couple of
other cool videos are working on I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
