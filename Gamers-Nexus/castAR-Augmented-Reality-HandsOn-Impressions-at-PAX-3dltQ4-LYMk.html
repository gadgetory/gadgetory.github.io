and we're wrapping up our pax prime 2015
coverage one of the last items we looked
at today was cast AR which is an
augmented reality solution so this is
different than what we've looked at with
HTC vive or oculus rift for instance
which are both VR or virtual reality
solutions with a are you still see and
can interact with the outside world so
it's not as isolating as VR and with
cast a are specifically we're using
glasses so you put the glasses on there
are two high refresh rate flickering
lenses in those glasses so 120 Hertz on
the refresh rate from memory and then
atop the lenses are two projectors and
the projectors shoot down whatever your
plane at a surface based on what you're
looking and the surface that is used for
cast AR is a reflective material so this
is similar to what's found on running
shoes for instance so you project it
down on the surface and then you can
move around to move how the image is
projected and where it lands on that
surface which makes it a little bit
unique and a couple of the unique
challenges faced by VR would include
hand modeling so NVR you obviously you
can't see your own hands because you
have a head-mounted display on and this
is problematic because there's an
information conveyance disconnect in
your brain when you're trying to
interact with a game another challenge
is multiplayer not really good to try
and add another person to the
environment when you're both wearing a
head-mounted completely isolating
displays so that is something you
generally lose with VR solutions with ar
you're more limited in your types of
games you can support in theory but
they're generally a little easier to
develop from what we've looked at and
they have a unique slant so bringing
board games for example dnd magic the
gathering or more traditional stuff like
battleship we saw a demo for Jenga we
saw a demo for and older PC games that
have been around for a while like marble
madness you can do all that in AR and
then interact with it on the surface of
the table using a wand controller so
that's what we did we have some b-roll
footage of all of that
that should be showing throughout the
video if you're curious what it looks
like we tried to capture through the
actual lens of the device which was a
challenge but none of this is rendered
footage so this is what it kind of looks
like although in reality obviously
you've got a bit more three-dimensional
depth and some more vertical height and
things like that you can perceive with
your own eyes so that is cast AR it's
pretty interesting technology we
actually did like it a lot and if you
check the link in the description below
you'll see an article from one of our
editors who goes more into the technical
detail how it works and what its
applications are you can see more about
cast a are going forward so CES will
have the max the next major update to
the technology and then it's shipping
sometime in 2016 so that is all for the
cast a our video coverage link in the
description below for the full technical
details and use case scenarios things
like that and we'll see you all next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
