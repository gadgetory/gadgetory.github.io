should tell you something about the
results we are talking about and these
Pro Mode versus gaming mode for the new
Vega frontier Edition video card which
has a driver package that has a button
that says gaming mode but it defaults to
pro mode theoretically one versus the
other would provide some kind of
different performance at least that is
what the commentary online would lead
you to believe including some comments
that perhaps Specht you perf might
perform better with pro mode versus
gaming mode we ran our test on pro mode
but it's easy enough to verify and run
them on gaming mode as well and further
there are some suggestions that video
games might play better with gaming mode
so we're talking about all that we're
going to put all that to rest there will
be a few charts but the data is so
consistent that it doesn't need to be a
lot of them and that's at the end of the
video I'll give you some more opinions
and commentary to at least add something
other than some simple data points but
before that this is brought to you by
our patreon backers at patreon.com slash
gamers Nexus thank you to those of you
who helped us there you can join our
community discord by supporting us on
patreon where we have a chat that I hand
out in most a day so check that out or
go to store that gamers next to spot not
to pick up a shirt if you want to
support us that way instead our initial
round of testing for the review and the
follow-up round for the clock for clock
benchmarking of fury X versus Vega use
the we'll call it appropriate driver
mode for each set of tasks so the
professional production applications
were in Pro Mode and likewise games are
in game mode now we're talking between
them for these benchmark numbers a quick
note here the immediate difference
between switching modes is a UI change
it basically pro mode is a slightly
changed version of Radeon settings if
you have an Andy card you probably know
what Radeon settings looks like the
gaming mode is identical to that
including wot man including Radeon chill
and really every other tab on that page
Pro Mode removes wot man but you can
still overclock you just have to do it
with a third-party application so wot
man is removed from the interface it's
still installed they just take the
button off the interface
and I believe Radeon chill is also
removed from the interface with Pro Mode
enabled so that's the immediate visible
difference it is a UI change other than
this the implicit change would be that
there is some form of impact to your
performance in either task game in
production and that seems to be a common
thread with some of the discussion
online and when we were speaking with
and these representatives the word that
we received that led us to believe that
there would in fact be a difference
hence we benchmarked everything for the
review in the appropriate mode thinking
that it might actually matter and that
it would be the most realistic use case
to do that way for each user group so
full testing methodology is in the
article below as always but it's really
pretty simple we toggle the mode
starting with production first as that's
the easiest to demonstrate we end up
with the numbers on the screen now
notice that there are some error bars
which indicate that the range of tests
to test variants basically accounts for
any differences here taking these into
account everything is equal not
effectively equal but equal and there's
no clear performance leader in either
mode there's no pattern which mode holds
the marginal within error differences
and because there's no pattern and there
is no clear winner that means that all
the tests are within variants and can be
declared as equal that was easy
let's get the fire strike with fire
strike ultra the difference is 6.5
points in the graphic score 0.1%
different we're at 49 30 6.5 points
after 5 averaged automated run for the
gaming mode card and 49 30 points after
the same run count on the pro growth
card if we look at the represented FPS
number instead of the scores the
difference looks even less significant
it's 0% we're at twenty five point five
versus twenty five point five for
graphics fps one and eighteen point five
verses eighteen point five for graphics
FPS - in fact if we update the chart and
include two significant figures or
digits after the decimal
there's now a difference twenty five
point five one versus twenty five point
four five and eighteen point five three
verses eighteen point five two so
that's not exciting next chart with time
spy we're seeing a difference in FPS of
0.33 five frames per second for graphics
one 0.53 5 payments per second for
graphics - after five average test
passes automatically executed with the
program closed in between these two are
identical in performance we technically
have more firestrike results but it's
boring so we can move on to games
because they firestrike extreme and by
Ã¶sterreich 1080p same thing there the
results are the same so let's move on to
for honor next with for honor at 4k and
extreme settings we're seeing a
performance difference of joke FPS
average and less than 1 fps in our frame
time values or the frame times
representative as the percentage values
the frame times and the frame rate are
all the same for honor at 1080p is also
the same as you can see in this 1080p
chart where we see differences around 1
FPS at most between the prone game modes
Metro last light at 4k post a difference
of 0 fps we're at 47 fps on both devices
with low is basically the same and a DP
is also basically the same less than 1
FPS difference between the modes and
that difference again doesn't have a
pattern so it's within variants and if
we ran the test 100 more times they'd
probably basically equal anyway finally
ashes of the singularity with DirectX 12
shows more of the same our numbers are
basically tied here there's no
significant difference between the two
driver modes with as of the singularity
even with DirectX 12 we have more data
we have data on Sniper Elite and on GTA
and a couple of other games I'm going to
save you the time of watching and me the
time of making the charts and tell you
that they're all the same and other than
that we're basically left with two modes
that show no difference it's sort of
frustrating because ambhi's marketing
materials and representatives
intentionally or not led us to believe
that there would actually be a
difference that was significant in some
form whether or not it was 20% versus 5%
either one is significant 0% is not
significant so little bit frustrating
there and the reason why is because if
this is the ultimate goal with game mode
versus promo
this is the endgame for Andy it's almost
insulting to the professional end-user
because they received the card and they
can turn on Pro Mode so that they can
use premiere or blender or CAD software
or whatever it may be all that does is
take away overclocking one would assume
so that they don't hurt themselves by
mistake or something like that
otherwise why I over talking sure
probably not too common in that kind of
use case but also why take it away
you're just adding driver complexity to
a driver package which is clearly
already very buggy wot man doesn't even
overclock correctly it's down clocks
HBM if you down clock the core or
overclock the core or really change
anything so wild man's already buggy
enough Andy you guys have enough to fix
there's no point in adding a button that
flashes the screen black to make you
feel like something has happened and
then removes wot man and I guess Radeon
chill that's what this comes down to it
does nothing and here's the thing if if
that's the goal it's a gimmick if that's
not the goal and Andy plants do more
with game mode and pro mode for example
incorporate whatever driver updates they
may have for games in the future maybe
that launched with RX Vega
maybe they improve gaming performance
and those aren't included for whatever
reason when pro mode is turned on if
that's the goal now we're talking about
something useful but it shows that this
driver package was fully unready to
launch with Vega frontier Edition I we
were we're pretty pretty neutral and
didn't share too much of an opinion in
the Vega review didn't share too much of
an opinion and some of the other content
but the opinion is here opinion is the
driver package was not ready that's
clear from looking at this either the
pro mode and game mode do something or
they don't if they don't it's stupid and
pointless if they do it wasn't ready
end of story as far as that goes this is
nothing more than a psychological switch
to make you feel like your graphics card
is doing something better than it
actually is
so we've tested it enough to feel
confident that games show no difference
the production applications just respect
be proficient or difference we did not
retest blender because we're having
enough problems with blender and Vega
drivers already I know the blender team
pushed patches but they're not perfect
it still crashes with certain types of
materials or effects that you can render
in that application so we are not seeing
the difference if someone has seen a
difference I would love to hear about it
so that I can test that same application
in that same use case and report it and
tell you all about how great the two
modes are but as it stands now from our
testing today no difference so thank you
for watching as always you can subscribe
for more patreon.com slash gamers Nexus
to help that directly store that gamers
ex has done that for shirts and we will
have more Vega coverage going up if you
missed the review go watch it it is
pretty straight forward straight shooter
neutral review goes over all the details
and then tells you why you should not
speculate about our ex Baker's
performance because it's too soon to
call and then come back for the RX maker
review I'll see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
