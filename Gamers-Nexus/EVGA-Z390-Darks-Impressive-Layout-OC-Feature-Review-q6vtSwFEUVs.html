hardcore overclocking and today we're
gonna be taking a look at the EVGA z3 90
darks points of interest because
unfortunately there's so much
interesting stuff on this motherboard
that if I try to also talk about the V
RMS in one video it just like it'd be
like 50 minutes long and I know that
because I have a 50 minute take of
everything on this motherboard so
instead that's getting split into two
pieces and this part is gonna be just
everything kind of interesting all the
motherboard so let's get right into it
because either way there's still a lot
to cover before that this video is
brought to you by the coarser 1i 140
compact gaming PC the corsair 1i 140 is
a small form-factor PC outfitted with a
9700 K RT x 28 e 32 gigabytes of RAM and
a 480 gigabyte nvme SSD all housed
within a 2 millimeter thick aluminum
chassis the corsair 1 i 140 is a 12
liter system fit for desktop use with
the same size the i 160 counterpart with
higher-end parts learn more at the link
in the description below the first thing
that everybody obviously noticed is
about this motherboard is that the DIMM
slots are very few and in a rather odd
location being jammed up onto the top
edge of the motherboard right normally
they're over here but an EVGA opted to
rotate the CPU socket 90 degrees to get
the DIMM slots up in up on the top edge
and there's two reasons for why they've
opted to do this one of them is that
basically the team working on this
motherboard are apparently a big fan of
old dfi motherboards and old dfi mah are
big fans of old efi motherboards and DF
I used to do motherboards where they
would have the DIMM slots up on the top
edge so they basically decided that they
wanted the z3 90 dark to be a visual
throwback to the dfi motherboards that
did that and that's one of the reasons
why the DIMM slots are are located where
they are now there are also there's also
a practical like electrical reason for
why they've put the DIMM slots up on the
top edge but unfortunately because what
separates like incredible extreme
overclocking motherboards from great
extreme overclocking motherboards and
then horrible motherboards is not the
actual like most of the time
it's not the like the CPU speeds you can
achieve it's all about the memory and
essentially everything that happens in
between the memory slots and the CPU you
know the the CPU socket where the the
memory connects to the CPU
so basically EVG doesn't want to give me
any information on anything happening in
this area and that includes the benefit
like because there are practical reasons
for why they've moved the DIMM slots up
there they just won't share them with me
because you know they fall into the
category of super of super secret speed
sauce for for memory overclocking so
yeah that's rather unfortunate that you
know we don't know why this is
beneficial but I can totally like
understand why EVGA doesn't want to
share because again this is really where
you know the board vendors can really
differentiate themselves is with their
memory layouts and then what they also
do in the BIOS for the for the memory
training anyway and the other thing that
you know well it kind of stands out on
this motherboard not to me because this
is an extreme overclocking motherboard
and this is kind of standard for those
now but to a lot of people it's the
motherboard is $500 it's a high-end
motherboard and it only has two DIMM
slots and this is a very simple reason
for this
so there's e3 90 dark targets extreme
overclocking and more importantly in
targets you know very high memory
frequency capabilities and by
eliminating the extra DIMM slots right
because you normally have to DIMM slots
on each channel on most other
motherboards this one you have only one
installed per channel by eliminating the
extra DIMM slots you actually well you
reduce the distance that your memory
signals have to travel from the DIMM
slots to the cpu and you reduce the well
the the DIMM slots themselves are
actually add a whole bunch of parasitics
to your memory traces because your
memory traces are actually shared
between your DIMM slots on a given
memory Channel so essentially what's
going on with eliminating the DIMM slots
is that EVGA is optimizing the memory
layout for best possible overclock for
the best possible memory overclocking
and that's why it's on a one DIMM per
channel config
raishin which is standard for
motherboards in this class I mean look
at the Asus apex series the Azrael cozy
formula series some of the gigabyte SOC
motherboards right like all of these
extreme overclocking motherboards it's
just like you you don't go with four
dims because it's bad for your maximum
memory frequency capability and as a
side effect also it you know impacts the
best kind of timings you can run at a
given frequency so yeah EVGA has opted
to go for just one dip on each channel
and that's pretty standard for a
motherboard in this class now where this
difference differentiates itself further
from other extreme overclocking
motherboards is that these DIMM slots
aren't any ordinary DIMM slots because
if we if we look at the back of the
board you can clearly see that there's
nothing coming through the PCB because
EVGA has opted to use surface mount
memory slots instead of through-hole
ones and the surface mount ones are a
bit more expensive but that's not the
main main issue with them and not really
the reason why vga is using them the
reason why they're going for the surface
mount memory slots is that these have at
least on paper even lower parasitics
than your conventional through-hole
memory memory slots so yeah EVGA is
opted to go for the SMD type here now
this is not unique to EVGA gigabyte has
a couple of motherboards that also use
these but yeah basically EVGA is just
going you know all-out with their memory
overclocking capabilities in the sort of
physical aspect of this motherboard and
actually speaking of the physical aspect
you know so we have the the fact that
the memory slots are in an odd location
there's very few of them they're using
SMT EVGA also opted to go for a 10 layer
PCB here to lay out the memory like to
lay out the entire motherboard with now
I'm not sure that they're actually
making full necessarily making full use
of that for the memory slots but it
basically does mean that they have a lot
of room to lay out everything however
they see lie
however they see necessary right and for
comparison most other high-end Z 390
boards stop at eight layers so EVGA is
just going you know two layers higher so
that just gives them that much more
space to lay out anything they feel like
laying out basically they've gone to the
absolute limit for optimizing the the
memory layout I mean like ten ten layers
is like X 299 territory in terms of feet
like PCB layers and they're doing it for
Z 390 and if you're wondering like super
high-end GPUs top out around 12 okay
like you don't really see anything in
consumer hardware with more than 12
layers of PCB and here we have a
motherboard with ten of them just to lay
out to DIMM slots so as well as quite
possibly a lot of the other features on
the motherboard but still it's it is an
added cost and it does mean that EVGA
can optimize this area of the board to
this area of the board to ridiculous
levels so anyway sort of moving on from
the the physical aspects of the memory
section right here well there's actually
rather fancy stuff going on on the back
of the board here as well but they also
told me not to talk about this either
so more super more more secret speed
sauce on the back of the board there so
yeah anyway one thing which is kind of
standard for most extreme overclocking
motherboards but was missing is actually
is missing from a lot of EVGA
motherboards until this one is a
controllable vtt DDR rail which is kind
of unfortunate because it really limits
your overclocking capabilities on like
past EVGA motherboards that aren't this
but here they have actually given us a
controllable vtt DDR so now they're
using so in the past they use like a LDO
where you were the only way to configure
the output voltage of that LDO was with
like two resistors on the new
motherboards well actually even one
resistor depending on what exactly you
wanted but on the dark they're using an
L do from UPI semiconductor it's a u P
8815 and this is actually controllable
with software so you can now tweak your
VT TD
are up and down and this is very very
handy when you're pushing certains kids
of Samsung Vita actually they're like
I've also seen it be beneficial on other
other dies it's just like it's not quite
like nobody cares as much about those
because they kind of suck they don't
clock as high so you know who cares it
doesn't go to 4000 CL 12 then it doesn't
matter but basically the issue with vtt
DDR is that the jtech rule or the j deck
role for the VTT DDR is that you
basically take your dim voltage right so
or VDD R or VDD Q whichever you prefer
to call it
take your VDD R divided by 2 and let's
your VT t DDR this works great until
your VDD R gets really high like say 2
volts at 2 volts VDD are you get like 1
volt
VT t DDR using the the usual rule the
issue with that is there's a lot of
memory kits out there where if you do
that they start lose all stability
completely lose all stability so you end
up in a situation where you you can keep
raising the voltage everything keeps
improving and then suddenly you get to a
point where yes the frequency keeps
getting higher but the stability just
doesn't improve anymore and oftentimes
it's because your VT t DDR is way too
high for your specific memory K so at
that point it's normally you need to
lock the VT t ddr2 something around 0.9
five volts my own memory kits for
example generally prefer about 0.9 3 5
all right like between point 9 3 and
0.94 so not even that point 95 but
basically once you're at the optimum
voltage for your memory sticks then you
can keep raising the VDD are like the
once you have optimum li TT DDR you can
keep raising the be DDR so you can go up
to like say 2.1 on your dim voltage and
still have to maintain that me TT DDR to
maintain stability so yeah this is a
this is actually a feature I requested
that they add for the z3 90 dark and I'm
really happy to see that it's made it
onto the board but considering
everything else they've done you know
you shouldn't be surprised I mean
they've gone all out for the memory
overclocking capabilities so this is
kind of a like a requirement at this
point so yeah we have that that's that's
very nice to have I'm a big fan of that
very useful not useful for day-to-day
you sir like day-to-day users but for
extreme overclocking it can really well
it can help you eke out the last hundred
to like hundred fifty megahertz out of
certain memory kits maybe even more but
like that's what it does for like my
kids so then moving on next to the VTT
DDR we have the dual postcodes
which actually only one of these
functions as a postcode but the reason
why we have for four of these 7-segment
display well two of these 7-segment
display whatever to to post goats we're
just gonna go with that because I can't
figure out which way to say it correctly
right now it's early in the morning so
the dual postcode so one of them acts as
a postcode when you're posting just as
normal but they also integrate a whole
bunch of monitoring functionality so you
can actually monitor temperatures and
you can monitor voltage with these which
is pretty cool so yeah if you don't have
like you know like they also give you
bolted Reed points right here with the
the probit headers which basically
that's a header that plugs in and then
you get a whole bunch of basically like
multimeter sockets coming off of that
which are actually really convenient
because multimeter probes fit snug into
that so you can just like hook up your
multimeter to the motherboard you don't
actually have to you know mess around
with like voltage read points how a lot
of other motherboard vendors do them or
they give you like a solder bump and you
need to stab the solder bump and and if
they're really creative they're gonna
put said solder bumps under like the 24
pin or something so that they're as hard
to reach as possible
well now EVGA has nice little headers
that you can just plug into and your
multimeter can be hooked up to the
motherboard but let's say you don't have
you know a million multimeter so you
can't monitor everything well you can
put some of your voltages onto the post
code over here so that you can monitor
them with this and the multimeter can be
monitoring something else so it's a
pretty nice feature as well obviously
the temperature monitoring is also
convenient as you that means you can
check your temperatures of the CPU
without having any like monitoring you
to letís open which is nice to do
because monitoring utilities lower your
benchmark scores so you don't usually
run any a while benchmarking so yeah
this is a pretty neat feature to happen
then we get some LEDs over here this
motherboard actually has a lot of LEDs
but none of them are RGB and all of them
are in my opinion infinitely more useful
so the two LEDs we get over here are dim
initialization indicators and these
probably would be some of the the less
useful ones especially for Z 390 so I
think these are like super useful on
like X 299 because X 299 has memory
controllers that have a tendency to drop
memory channels as in you can boot up
and instead of initializing with you
know you have four sticks plug it in
because it's a four channel CPU so one
want one stick per channel and it
initializes and you get eight gigs of
RAM instead of the 32 you were expecting
and the reasoning is the memory
controller decides to drop after the
memory sticks well with these kinds of
LED indicators you can actually see that
the memory training failed as soon as
the memory training post codes finish so
long before you even get into the
operating system you will know that
there's like an issue with your memory
initialization which can save you a lot
of time because you won't have to bother
to go all the way into Windows to
realize that you're missing half of your
memory channels and your scores suck
because there's missing memory channels
so yeah the reason why I don't think
it's gonna be that useful as III 90 is
that as far as I'm aware as III 90
doesn't drop the memory channels
anywhere near as much at least I've not
seen it on either my 80s 86 K or 99
hundred K you know the the CPU the
memory controller on these things either
initializes both both channels perfectly
or the whole thing doesn't start at all
so sure how useful that's gonna be but
you know it definitely doesn't hurt
anything next we have the best button
ever created this is the safe boot
button for those of you who like me
don't save your BIOS profiles regularly
so you do like three hours of tweaking
and then you know you screw up one
setting and the system stops posting and
you haven't saved a single profile in
those three hours well this button will
save you from from that kind of scenario
because you won't have to clear the CMOS
when that happens you can just hit the
safe boot
button and it'll get you into the bios
without having to wipe all of your
settings so all your settings will be
still there but it'll boot up on like
safe defaults and essentially you know
save you from having to do a whole lot
of work all over again now for those of
you who like encase the safe boot button
doesn't work there is still a clear CMOS
there's also a clear CMOS on the rear
i/o which personally I would say I would
have preferred a safe boot over there as
well because the safe boot is so
convenient that if I had you know if I
committed the heresy that is installing
this motherboard inside a case I would
honestly take off the side panel and get
the safe boot bus in anyway if I screwed
up while this wasn't inside a case
because this is so convenient so yeah
that's that's that right there next to
that we have the standard EVGA array of
sort of voltage indicator LEDs so
basically these indicate that you just
have you know varies vrm is functioning
so it'll tell you like oh yeah VDD are
is present and mana VDD are is present v
core is present VC CSA is present just
that all of your voltages are actually
all of your V arms are essentially
firing up I've like I can see a
situation like if one of the VR I'm just
dies then this will obviously indicate
that hey your your V R M is dead right
because the LED will turn off but like I
think the the usefulness of these will
probably go up the older the motherboard
is so initially I don't I don't think I
well initially you wouldn't wouldn't
necessarily need to use these much
because well the the arms on the board
should shouldn't have issues starting up
like that's kind of like not gonna
happen unless you get like a dead on a
rival board or something so yeah you
know they're they don't hurt anything
but I've never found a use for them
myself yet though I can see how they
would be handy like if you have just if
the motherboard just becomes damaged in
some way then this will save you a lot
of troubleshooting time it's just that
you shouldn't probably be breaking the
motherboard in the first place right
this is kind of one of those
troubleshooting features where it's like
oh you screwed up let us help you so
it's still nice for that kind of
but you know kind of limited use in that
sense next we have a USB header here and
this is for BIOS flashback so you can
actually flash the BIOS on this
motherboard without even having a CPU
installed you just need standby power
and a USB stick with the right format
and then file name and then you know
press some but I'm actually no I didn't
read through the full procedure for it
so I'm not sure what you actually have
to press to get it to work but uh yeah
you do you do have a BIOS flashback over
there so that's pretty neat then you
have your power and reset which is just
completely standard from other boards
like this and that kind of covers that
area of the motherboard then we get the
EVGA high-end motherboard standard of
right angle actually they've put these
on more motherboards recently right
angle power connectors so 24 pin at the
at a right angle and they've recessed
them into the motherboard because this
thing is a ATX right you can see how it
goes way past the the screw hole here so
yeah this is the ATX this is basically
to reduce the incompatibility with
various cases that the e ATX form factor
runs into and then you know putting the
the connectors at an angle like this
further increases because obviously if
the if this 24 pin was over here right
ending over here then you'd have a
connector that's sticking out like there
and then then you'd finally have the
cables and there's a lot of cable cases
where your cable management hole would
be like there right or here so that
won't just like that won't work at all
and then you'll be forced to like run
your 24 pins through like who the hell
knows where so yeah essentially that's
trying to reduce some of that it does
look very nice like you know it is
pleasing it does also run into issues it
can run into issues with with some cases
ultimately this motherboard is meant for
a test bench and if this is on a test
bench it does make it easier to see the
post code because there's no you know
wires sticking up out of this area and
the the buttons are all easier to reach
because you don't have to reach over the
24 pin which if it's sticking straight
up is actually rather tall and obnoxious
so yeah that that's kind of that so on a
test bench this really doesn't affect
anything inside a case it could cause
some issues
moving on we're gonna address these in
the vrm video though I think if you've
seen enough of my movie videos you
already know exactly what I'm gonna say
about those anyway board comes with
triple vials this is kind of standard
for the dark motherboards from EVGA so
here's your triple bios which one of
your BIOS chips is actually socketed so
if you really screw up and brick every
single chip on the motherboard you can
actually just remove one of the chips
and like ask EVGA to send you a
replacement or or use a hardware flasher
to like flash it you could also try
flash them directly on the motherboard
that's just like more difficult for most
people to do any like that that's more
difficult to do than if you can remove
the chip so yeah one of the chips is
socketed there is triple BIOS I'm a big
like I think like if you have dual BIOS
with with a switch that's already good
enough in my book but when you have
triple BIOS I mean and it's socketed
it's just like well I it's it's a bit
better than than dual BIOS it certainly
means that if you want to have like
multiple different iterations of like
the biases or there's like one BIOS
which you found that works better for a
certain scenario than another BIOS you
can have like you know as many BIOS is
installed on the motherboard as you want
at the same time well assuming you only
want three but I don't think anyone who
like I don't know why you'd want more
than two at the at most times anyway but
you know yeah you can store more BIOS is
on the motherboard at the same time so
you can basically go through like oh
this BIOS is really good for this doing
this and this BIOS is really good for
something else so you can keep them all
on the motherboard instead of messing
around with flashing every time you want
to do a different like use the
motherboard differently so that's kind
of nice to have here and actually I
think multiple BIOS is for like an
extreme overclocking motherboard like a
minimum requirement like and I'm saying
that because I recently like I recently
realized my Maximus 11 gene from Asus
has no dual BIOS which is just like I
have no idea what they were thinking
III guess BIOS chips also cost way too
much for Asus along with doublers as
well anyway moving on next to the triple
BIOS we find a PCIe on/off switch
so while PCIe in a yeah on/off switch
essentially what that allows you to do
is enable your PCIe slots and disable
them as well as I'm not to devices and
the cool thing is while the idea behind
this is if you have like water-cooled
GPUs and one of them starts to
malfunction you can just disable it with
with the you know like it malfunctions
in such a way that you can't even post
with it present you can actually just
disable the PCIe slot it's in and you
don't have to worry about the the GPU
not working so that that's pretty cool
and also to make sure that you don't
forget which slots are enabled or
disabled EVGA actually has LEDs on the
motherboard to indicate that the the
PCIe slots are you know active and then
actually also to indicate if the PCIe
slot like the device in the slaw is
initializing properly so again I like I
think this is a get really really cool i
I've certainly like I've this is pretty
standard for like extreme overclocking
motherboards for a while to have this
kind of feature and I've used it a lot
myself and I gotta say that the LEDs are
actually really really helpful as well
because I have sometimes like installed
GPUs and PCIe slots I previously
disabled and then just forgot about it
and then was like why is the GPU not
starting like what the hell is wrong
right
so yeah you do have indicators for that
being acted like for the PCIe slots
being active or not and that is on every
single PCIe slot here as well as the
initialization of the device so that's
pretty cool
next to that we get another switch this
is slow mode this is another one of
those features I actually requested that
they add though admittedly I think it
would have been more useful in like X to
99 then on Z 390 but the idea behind
this which is the the slow bone switch
what it does it forces the CPU into the
lowest core ratio possible so you can
essentially like if you're on liquid
nitrogen right you get into your
operating system at like six-and-a-half
gigahertz or seven gigahertz or whatever
frequency and you need to like configure
something so that you can run your
benchmark well you don't really want to
be configuring windows at 6 gigahertz or
6 and 1/2 gigahertz that's a massive
waste of power because your power
consumption is actually relatively
linear with your frequency so instead of
running at 6 gigahertz well you know on
Windows desktop you can just flick the
slow mode switch it'll put the CPU to
like 8x or 12 X I'm not sure which it is
on Z 390
I think it's a tax so you'll instead of
like six gigahertz plus you'll be like
eight like 800 megahertz were basically
around a gigahertz in frequency which
will cut down your power consumption
very heavily like quite significantly
which means you'll be wasting less
liquid nitrogen while sitting on desktop
you know while sitting on the desktop
messing with settings and the other
benefit is is obviously it reduces the
likeliness of the system crashing when
you're at you know point eight gigahertz
the other use is when you're like making
your screen shot after finishing a
benchmark right you can you can capture
the screenshot and then when you go to
save it you can hit the slow mode switch
because there's actually rules against
making screenshots with slow mode
enabled because it makes it really hard
to figure out what frequency you were
running at but after you have the screen
shot and you're going to save it you can
actually put it into slow mode so that
it doesn't crash while saving because
that tends to also happen when you're
like really on the edge for some of the
single core benchmarks out there
yeah saving a screen shot suddenly
becomes a very difficult thing to do
sometimes and the slow mode switch can
make it that much less difficult so yeah
very nice feature to have as well and
then we get yet more extreme
overclocking features also there's a LED
indicators for the is it the u dot -
yeah it is the U dot two connectors over
here so because they're I assume yeah
they're part of the PCIe so there's LED
indicators for that as well
but anyway next we get legacy SATA over
here so the idea behind this is is that
there's a whole bunch of old benchmarks
that run best on Windows XP
unfortunately Windows XP doesn't support
modern Intel chipsets very well so the
you gets you get run into this difficult
situation where you can't like boot with
Windows XP on most motherboards at all
so this right here is an old light is an
AZ media SATA 3 controller that is
Windows XP compatible there's also like
a specific BIOS that the motherboard
needs to be compatible with Windows XP
but basically the idea is you get the
the the controller here for your SATA 3
you get the BIOS and the motherboard is
now Windows XP compatible and you can
run very old you know single core
benchmarks in Windows XP which is their
preferred operating system they just
score way higher in that than they do in
like Windows 10 or Windows 7 and that
means that if you're using this
motherboard you know if you're going for
a benchmark like say SuperPi 32 million
or 1 million which is a benchmark that
is like that that's one of the
benchmarks which really really likes
running on Windows XP well if somebody's
running seven gigahertz and like the
same memory settings as you and you have
Windows XP and their own like Windows 7
or 10 you can probably beat them at like
6.9 or or even lower actually you can
probably beat them with even lower a CPU
clock speeds so that makes a big
difference in some of those benchmarks
and obviously if you match them on a
clock speed you're just gonna you can
completely crush them assuming your
Windows XP configuration is an on point
so yeah you know this this is a very
niche extreme overclocking feature but
it's definitely something that I'm sure
a lot of people who are into SuperPi 32
million benchmarking will appreciate
I personally won't because I can't be
bothered with installing that many
different operating systems and messing
with that but there are definitely
people you know who spend a ton of time
just running super PI 32 million and for
them this is gonna be very very handy so
then moving along the bottom edge we
have some color-coded front panel
headers and they've actually kept these
you know facing up so that it's easy to
see where what you're actually
installing we're moving along the edge
we also get a speaker here so not only
can you see the motherboard complaining
you can hear the motherboard complaining
or succeeding as well because it'll beep
when it finishes initialization pretty
much based on how many USB devices you
have plugged in so that's also well you
know you can always disable it in the
BIOS oh it's not like it actually hurts
anything and a lot of motherboards don't
bother to include this so it's kind of a
night like EVGA puts it everywhere so
it's kind of an isle yeah it's it's a
nice feature to have I guess personally
I don't really care well I've actually
found it rather rather useful in my own
experience because I can look away from
the system why let's initialize like
posting and not miss the BIOS coming up
anyway next we got a 6 pin power
connector and well this is here for
extra power to the PCIe slots the
why I don't think this is actually very
useful in here is the like and video
doesn't support more than two-way SLI
AMD doesn't support like with the Radeon
7 a.m. D isn't going to support more
than one GPU at all so the thing that
this is solving is essentially that like
the reason why this exists is that the
24 pin has a very limited amount of 12
volts power available in it because
there's only two pins in a 24 pin with
12 volts and so what tends to happen is
if you're running like a 3 Way or 4-way
GPU setup and they pull a lot of power
from the PCIe slot you tend to melt the
24 pin 12 volt power connector you know
the 12 volt pins on a 24 pin and so that
solves that but the thing is I don't
think anybody's gonna buy this
motherboard and run a 3-way or 4-way set
up in it anyway because this last slot
is x4 so even if you went with 1080 T
eyes you can't run SLI off of an X force
law and video doesn't let you so the
only well I guess some people might well
I could run like 3-way crossfire on it
but it's less than ideal
so like this this is solving the issue
that this motherboard really shouldn't
run into but EVGA seems to like to put
these six pins just about freakin
everywhere
I mean they've put them on like I have a
micro ATX motherboard with two PCIe
slots from EVGA with a 6 pin like it's
physically not possible to put more than
two GPUs in it and they still have the
extra PCIe power so I guess they're just
really like they want to make absolutely
certain that you have all of the the
PCIe slot power you could have ever
wanted to never need but yeah that that
pretty much covers it this board does
every well yeah as far as extreme
overclocking goes it does everything
it's not a workstation motherboard so it
has limited you know memory capacity
support it did like the the PCIe expand
expansion options aren't what I would
consider ideal right again there's no
plx chip on this because well as I said
if you're gonna run 2-way SLI at most
and if even that and the thing with the
plx chips is if you don't actually
to use a lot of PCIe devices at the same
time they do add a bit of latency to
your PCIe communication so if you're
running just a single card or a dual
card setup not having a plx chip is
actually a good thing if you need a
bunch of PCI you can activity then you
know you're looking at like 3gb well not
necessarily three GPUs but just a lot of
PC's ie devices in general well then you
know the P Alex chip becomes handy but
that's really that that's like a
workstation scenario and this this
motherboard won't go into a workstation
like you can't fit enough RAM in it
already like that alone is already
probably going to be a problem for for
that kind of application so you know
this this is purpose-built to max out
extreme overclocks and it goes super far
to like you know it does everything to
to do that and I'm a huge fan of that I
think this motherboard is absolutely
incredible but it is very focused in
what it tries to sets out to do and the
features really reflect that so yeah I'm
a big fan of it I can't wait to try this
motherboard out because the memory
overclocking should be absolutely
incredible on it and yeah so that's the
that's the feature set and points of
interest on the z3 90 dark we're gonna
cover the vrm separately and I'll give
you a teaser there awesome um but uh
yeah that's it for this video thank you
for watching like share subscribe leave
any comments questions suggestions down
in the comment section below
if you'd like to support gamers Nexus
their store dog gamers Nexus not net for
shirts and mugs and that kind of thing
as well as the actual mod map that you
can see in the background of the
motherboard and if you'd like to see
more content from me I have a channel
called actually a hardcore overclocking
where I do more overclocking things so
yeah and you're very likely there's
gonna be a bunch of like z3i new dark
content going up sometime soon because
I've recently got the board so yeah
that's it for the video thanks for
watching and good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
