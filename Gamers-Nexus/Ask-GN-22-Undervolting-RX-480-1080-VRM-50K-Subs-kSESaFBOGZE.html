ask GaN following a week of crazy rx 480
of mods and benchmarks of course after
the 1080 mods and benchmarks and as
always you can leave questions in the
comments below and we'll try to address
them in the next episode before getting
to this episode's content it is brought
to you by Origin PC and their new
Chronos PC which is equipped with either
the gtx 1080 or our X 480 available on
their store so getting to the questions
the first one I wanted to look at is
pertinent to the last few days of
discussion on overclocking with the RX
480 and it's a general question asked by
many of you basically stating why does
under volting help with the RX 480 so
this is something we've seen on reddit
threads and a couple other places on the
internet basically some folks have found
that if they under volt or lower the
voltage on there are X 480 they're
getting a more stable clock rate and
that improves frame rates so the way
this works at a top level first of all
the RX 480
Polaris and GT X 1080 Pascal
architectures are both pretty complex
with their their boost functions boost
3.0 friend vidya and just normal
boosting for AMD and part of that
complexity is an attempt at power
savings during idle States or low load
States
part of it is throttling the clock rates
as the power increases either
undesirable levels or unsustainable
levels and those things factor in too if
you were to plot it against time you'll
see that the frequency sometimes goes a
little bit like that and what you want
is a line that's as flat as possible
when you're playing games and we show
this in our reviews for both of these
cards so because of the frequency
modulation and because AMD and NVIDIA
are both kind of looking at ok this is
what our frame rate target is if you've
defined one the under volting will help
by two main modes and one is reducing
the power consumption as you increase
your voltage you also increase the power
diversion in watts
to that function of the GPU so you're
giving more power to the voltage which
helps stabilize the clock rate if you're
overclocking but it also takes power
away from other components like the core
and the memory and so under voltage
means that you're freeing up some of
that extra wattage for use elsewhere in
the system or the video card in this
instance but it also means that you may
threaten the stability of your clock
because you can't push the frequency as
high didn't a potentially but in the
case the RX 488 kind of a special card
because of its power draw because of the
issues that have been discussed the last
few days and we'll have videos on this
with the PCIe bus and things like that
under volting will primarily benefit by
not threatening stability if you're
sticking too close to stock clocks and
it will also allow extra power to be
given to the cores so what happens is if
you look at our how to overclock guide
for the rx 480 you'll see that when I
first pushed the clock rate to 1,300
megahertz which is maybe a 30 to 40
megahertz offset we don't actually hit
that 13 hundred megahertz numbers so the
overclock is almost a phantom overclock
it's not actually doing anything and it
doesn't do anything until I increase the
power percent given to the the card so
increase that to 50 percent that frees
up more power for the GP by way of
allowing with the draw more and that
allows the higher clock rate so by under
volting you can sort of do the same
thing without even having to increase
that power percent or at least without
having to increase it as far as we did
and you're able to preserve sort of a
lower power state on the card while
maintaining a more stable stock or
slight overclock clock rates so
hopefully that answers the basics of it
it's a very complex question with these
new boost clocks on these these two
architectures but that's the top level
that pretty much explains how it works
in a way that that is relevant to
overclocking next question is from Lee
ods who's regular on the channel leo
says we are seeing tons of custom pascal
cards with added power inputs and
decreased power delivery is there any
point to that at this
at all or is that just something that
manufacturers are doing to be able to
checkboxes on feature lists but
ultimately give you no advantage of
course historically better check see
basically asking we get a better
overclock if there's more vrm phases
more power or should you just buy the
cheapest pascal card with a decent
cooler so this is a good question the
main the main thing to look at here
we've posted this in our GT x 1080
review of the msi card and of the
reference card and of our own hybrid
model which we've built here and
basically we're seeing very little
additional overclocking if any at all
from these more advanced vrm phasing
power delivery solutions like the msi
one which even has an extra power header
so you might get a little bit extra room
i think we were getting like 20 or 30
megahertz extra off of MSI's card we got
i think about a hundred extra megahertz
out of this
but of course silicon is different but
the cooling solution didn't matter quite
a bit ultimately though you're looking
at a couple frames per second if you are
overclocking four frames per second so
no it wouldn't be worth released but
dumping a ton of money into a high-end
1080 if you're just after FPS if you're
trying to get as much overclock as you
can it's really not an enthusiast
overclocking architecture you can get
pretty far with pascal overclocking sort
of in the 2100 megahertz range but
that's still it doesn't feel like a lot
when you're actually doing it because
it's maybe one or two steps and you're
kind of done there's no more stability
left in the card to be had so kind of
answering the question
I wouldn't go buy the cheapest card
certainly especially if it's something
with a cheap plastic blower fan that's
kind of like the reference design but
with a worse fan that's gonna be noisy
and have a bad cooler so always
prioritize thermals when you're trying
to spend less but don't really care
about overclocking and still prioritize
thermals so look at the multi sort of
push fan coolers in terms of extra power
phases I'm not seeing a lot of
difference right now and that is mostly
because of V BIOS and
whatever limitations Pascal and its
unique architecture has this is still a
new process notes we're still learning
about it so yeah I wouldn't go and spend
a bunch of money on some insane
overclocking card right now for example
if a 1080 lightning were to come out
today I don't think I would necessarily
recommend buying it unless they do some
kind of custom V bios that does not have
the Nvidia imposed BIOS limitations or
voltage limitations I should say because
those are what's ultimately going to
hold you back and I don't know if
there's V BIOS limitations are for any
other reason then maybe just this new
FinFET process doesn't survive well at
these higher frequencies and voltages
for the long term use or it could just
be trying to keep things under control
if there's a higher end card coming out
soon or any number of reasons but no I
just wait wait and see what happens if
there's like V BIOS hacks on posts on a
forum maybe it'll be worth it then next
question cryo cryo Hell Inc says
regarding the hybrid GPUs EVGA GTX 1080
hybrid in an MSI 1080 Seahawk and
gigabytes 1080 extreme water forest
which one to pick cooling wise in the
future saw your DIY video for the 1080
hybrid and the results are impressive
will you test those cards so we've
tested the Seahawk from the last
generation and I'll be testing hopefully
the new one it's the same as course
there's hydrographics msi provides the
board courser provides the cooler eb J's
got their hybrid model and then gigabyte
it's got the water force as mentioned
the water force is a little bit
different the water for school is it
more than just the GPU if you look at it
it's got some extra copper in there and
it's piping some of the water through
other components which helps keep those
other components cooler but also means
that your liquid temperature will be
higher and I would suspect and I have
not tested this I would suspect that the
GPU core temperature would be slightly
higher than something like the EVGA
hybrid but your cooling things like the
VR am more efficiently so there's
trade-off there it's the same thing we
saw with the fury X where you're piping
water through more components liquid
temperature is higher as a result but
overall card temperatures
that's that's the different one here the
Seahawk and the EVGA hybrid function the
same way they basically use a CLC mount
just like this CLC mounted to a card and
a bracket and then a blower fan for the
vrm so those work the same way and the
vram I should say the EVGA model
historically we've seen performs better
that's for a few reasons one the the
cold plate on the liquid cooler has an
extrusion or protrusion and that adds
basically extra copper to sink the heat
before wicking it away and dissipating
it and the fan design is different of
course that's important and an MSI is
Seahawk uses an H 55 CLC that's a CPU
cooler it's got the same cold plate on
it that is used for the age 55 and those
are targeted more towards cooling cpus
so there's different hotspots on CPUs
than on GPU silicon so you see some
differences there now the Seahawk in the
past generation was overclocked higher
so they were slightly higher FPS results
so really became a trade-off what you
wanted there both of those cards were
fine when I tested them the the hybrid
was more thermally impressive but the
Seahawk is certainly fine too it just it
comes out of the price relief there's a
$50 difference then I probably lean
towards the cheaper one for the most
part or the one that looks the best if
it's if that's your thing the 1080 water
force we will see I'm not sure what to
think of that yet next question is CY
2087 I'm doing my first system bill
wanted to wait for the release of the 10
series of GPUs now that they're here I
noticed the sweet spot for gaming seems
to have shifted from 1080p to 1440p that
seems somewhat accurate that's the
direction I'm planning to go but give
them the money of the monitors required
have also gone up in price recently do
Planet D reviews monitors so I think I
will kind of address this at a general
level one thing to note is don't skimp
on your monitor purchase especially now
because the ability of GPUs isn't
increasing to push those high
resolutions and people especially me in
the past people tend to buy their
monitor and stay
with it for a number of years I would
imagine most of you do the same unless
you really you really like getting a new
monitor regularly so I would spend extra
money on a monitor certainly and and
grow into it as opposed to buying a high
on GPU and not being able to utilize it
fully that would be general advice as
far as the last bit of this question I
don't know if they'll work well that
1070 speaking specifically to the X 34
the actual 34 is it crazy good monitor I
really like that monitor
I don't normally develop opinions like
that for hard work because we kind of
just go through it and review it and do
objective analysis but the X 34 has
grown on me and I do like that display
that said it's also crazy expensive it's
like $1,200 the g-sync
or it was anyway last I looked that's
it's good I would not spend $1,200 on it
that's your like a month of rent there
it's yeah the predator is good
the 1070 will run games on the predator
you'll have to drop your settings in
some cases basically if you want to
interpolate our results look at our
1440p benchmarking and look at our 4k
benchmarking 34 40 by 1440 is right in
between them like halfway between all
you have to do is multiply the pixels
the width by height and you get a total
pixel count and then you can kind of
interpolate the results based on that
percentage if you want hard numbers one
of my friends over at Tech gauge comm
Rob Williams he ran tests on ultra wide
and you can view his results and I would
encourage you to do so because he does
he doesn't work that I trust and that is
rare so he has some hard numbers for you
the last question whoever that guy is
says so was Steve another ask another
ask GN episode without cornrows I would
be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed
but that's neither here nor there right
now I'm sure you are pretty skeptical
when it comes to my comments and I don't
blame you but I have a real question all
right so we got G's question considering
the recent leaks of specs for Nvidia's
up next tesla card the potential pricing
and specs of and these of Vega series in
relation to Polaris and the specs and
pricing of the 1080 when Wendy
next question the next question was
about a hair products you know welcome
to my crib come on in
so we got all this stuff right here in
the trash can that's my L'Oreal is my
Pantene we got this up here that's my
boy what's with my favorite statue in
this place okay so have a thermal paste
this compressed air to dry out you know
a blow dryer and we've got some of this
anti-static mat cleaner deep down in the
roots you know I'm talking about that's
how we get this right here and I'll get
you so that's the meat of cameras
anxious hair</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
