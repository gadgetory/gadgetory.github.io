model 70 30 which is a supercomputer
technically this was the fastest
computer in the world in 1961 they only
built nine of them in 1961 so that's you
were working on this right that's right
as some kind of fetal thing there was
the crate what about the crazy for
computer is that before this right after
that was from the 1976 ok so there's
great the Cray one yeah sacr√© one was
after this and what's is there anything
special about this time we need to know
this was one of its massive is one of
the pretty much the first big computer
that had transistors and before that
everything was vacuum to write it had
one Meg of memory it costs eight million
dollars is that one megabyte of ram one
megabyte of RAM do you know what Ram
type it was it was core memory core
memory yeah what did core memory look
like it was basically is that like all
the wire doughnuts ok I was iron donuts
with wires through and then the the Cray
that came after it did pray sort of put
this out of commission I guess that's
how do they replace this or no there was
a whole bunch of pastor supercomputers
in between a Cray worked for cdc ave a
via an IBM sort of lost the
supercomputing business at some point
sort of like they lost everything now
yeah except for Watson except for what
that's apparently the future yeah I like
the panel if you like if this was your
PC you could see what in this insight
every one of your registers because it
displayed at all is that what that is
yeah these are these are the registers
where the program counter is so you
could actually see the machine running
and where were they I guess if it halted
you could tell exactly what was inside
of a time time for for folks who don't
necessarily understand that any type of
programming when we're looking at
registers I mean what is it actually
telling us like when you look at this
stuff the belly goes with her in them
yeah then what's over here is that more
the same I think I took some pictures of
this week
the register one register to program
count register word count register tape
drives down here tape drive buttons
anyway these are controlled that's just
some big control panel and control panel
wouldn't make him Henry 48 million
dollars I don't know if that eight
million dollars is the is nineteen sixty
one dollars or modding down romanik if
it's modern dollars if it's 1961 dollars
it's like 50 million dollars are
circling how much room for eight
megabytes or one megabyte by eight
million billion dollars for one megabyte
yeah a machine with one megabyte of ram
does this have a speed anywhere what was
how fast is this 714 thousand ads per
second what's our ads as in like had two
numbers together yeah so why did they
measure it that way let's let less than
a megahertz well good megahertz you
double but one millionaires per second
okay so this thing was pretty slow why
is it measured in ads per second why
specifically that's just that's just
what they decided that's just what they
decided let's talk about the so let's
talk about the Cray one for a minute so
cray Juan made by Cray research of
course what do you know about that one I
actually worked on the Craig 1s moves a
basically a Fortran machine and it's
sort of like a modern processor in a way
because you don't want modern Intel you
have a bx the head vectors just like
that on this machine so you could add 64
so you can think of a px when you worked
on it what did you do on it I did the
electromagnetic field calculations for
actually designing what was the pre XMP
right the more modern ones so we were
modeling the twisted pair that hooks
together the circuit boards now you
would have traces on a circuit board
hooking the memory to the CPU back then
they did it with twisted pairs and
physical wise physical wires this the
Cray one was I think was running at 70
megahertz which was the fastest machine
in the world
time so seven is my guess is all single
core I this is back before the one that
came after the supriya X and P at four
course all right okay so they actually
build a foreign an eight-core version
based on this one right into the 80s I
saw want it so this is a c-shape the
Cray one the reason is a c-shape is they
had a timing problem right she wanted to
keep the maximum distance I believe
between circuit boards wiring it was
eight inches so in order to keep the
timing they made into C shape the power
supplies all through the bottom of it so
it power like a locomotive right it was
it was and it was not cheap i think that
that thing was like 10 million dollars
wellin tall leather it's all leather
yeah it's all leather what is the case
okay it's encased in leather no and get
the leather in any color you're right
one of the other things there's like a
liquid-cooled that's a Cree too so just
over there yeah the crate is liquid cool
that was liquid cooled with fluorine
okay and each create two came with a
custom waterfall for the millions of
those you got a custom water is a
waterfall functional or was it just
feels like it was just for looks okay so
it made it look cool right but the
liquid I guess felda there's what kind
of like what was it chlorine fluorine
some kind of worried falls down and just
pumps through what did it cool a CPU or
something or cooled the whole thing the
entire machine was immersed in it okay
and it would pump it through and take it
out running through the waterfall and
chill it and it would come back in so
they were pretty neat to look at so
that's on the earlier supercomputers I
guess yeah with liquid cooling and then
just days ago we saw Nvidia's
two-hundred-thousand-dollar wasn't even
a supercomputer it's just a high-end box
for whatever that was 126,000 yeah
yeah it was 170 teraflops yeah and my
clothes these away there are millions of
dollars what do you get rid of a crate I
don't know I guess to be fair modern
five-hundred-dollar computers probably
better than these right yeah quote away
yeah so one of the first things roller
can i hear is the ram ack which is the
first destroy disk drive and it's got
these massive platters i don't how many
of you flatters run there's a 50 pod
rooms its steep platters and that stores
how much data five megabytes five
megabytes so something like five million
characters five megabytes of data and
you've got 128 megabytes so this is a
micro SD card that we shoot with you
can't even see it on the camera I'm sure
128 gigabytes right but twenty thousand
times more on this then and this is a
lot more faster what's the ram I ex
Ben's at a 1200 RPM 500 rpm 1200 RPM it
stores 5 megabytes of data and it was on
lease right was on least thirty thousand
dollars a month converted if you got a
small computer with it from IBM and when
was when was it made 1950 cilic ison so
1956 that is the first disk drive and
we've got plenty of beer all of it but
there's some other cool stuff too like
we're talking earlier about some of the
early storage on tapes obviously tapes
predated this is that right tapes
predated this and then drums also
predated right we have some b roll of
drums yes yeah so that's the ram ack and
i guess in our day we're going to see
the end of the disks are in the next few
years so yeah this is the beginning and
we're gonna see the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
