always you can leave your questions in
the comment section below and we'll try
to get to them before next week for this
week we have a few interesting questions
including where are all of the GPUs many
of you know that answer already what was
Intel thinking with the current KB Lake
X launch and then we'll be talking about
some other user questions as well
including things about bloatware and
liquid cooling xbox one versus pc type
of discussion all that so before getting
to that this one is brought to you by
our own store so store dock gamers next
to scott net we just restocked these
shirts these are the tri-blend graph
shirts they are they're pretty cool I
like this logo a lot actually but just
restock them they've been out for a few
weeks so they're on stored out gamers
access not not now if you're interested
but let's get into the questions so the
first one to discuss is probably the
what was Intel thinking question that we
just posted the KB like X review for the
7740 X and if you haven't seen it check
it out but more or less the conclusion
was why does this exist not only is it
it's a refresh which it's okay for
refresh is to exist as long as they
provide something this refresh is on a
different motherboard than than the
original then its predecessor so that
makes it kind of weird because you can't
upgrade from an existing z2 sony board
and move from something like a G 4560
into a 7740 X it's not possible
physically impossible to do it so that's
that's why I guess the question is what
are they doing and why well there's a
few things here first of all it's
important I think to point out that the
technology for the CPUs is still fine
there are problems like with the
thermals because we saw again with
overclocking we were able to pretty
routinely hit 100 Celsius with the 7740
X a crack in X 62 maxed out for the pump
and the fans getting pretty hot but as
far as able to perform work and do
various work those AVX support is pretty
good on skylake x
and the CPU is function fine the
technology is there the architecture
isn't brand new it's all fairly well
optimized for by developers already so
they have a good foundation it just
seems kind of like Intel is throwing a
lot of that away with its launch and
part of that I think is largely the
price argument where you can have great
technology but if the price doesn't make
sense for your audience then it's sort
of irrelevant and then also just a none
exciting launch for enthusiasts who
aren't building a TDT systems or high
end desktop systems so that's that's the
thing to point out first is that this is
not a messy launch and it's definitely
fair to say it's a messy launch for
Intel if people get like all the media
coverage basically so it it's not a
messy launch because the technology is
extremely flawed or anything like that
there some problems with BIOS but the
CDs themselves are more or less fine
other than the thermals so what's the
problem that well the problem is with
AMD
and Rison now there's suddenly a point
of comparison where you can look at the
r7 cpus and if you're building an HTTP
system and you're an enthusiast who does
some blender rendering or some premier
rendering or things like that on the
side and it's CPU accelerated maybe for
physics or whatever then Raisa makes
good sense and it's cheap the i9 CPUs
are very power hungry so they're flawed
in that way they can run hots but not
all of them do it kind of depends
the i7s run hot and are not particularly
exciting and they are not cheap either
so the $9,000 and a10 core part that's
still seven hundred dollars cheaper than
until the last ten core part so normally
without perspective that would look
pretty good he'd be like wow you can get
a ten core part for seven hundred
dollars less than last year
great but then you look around and the
eight core isin parts are at we're
ignoring the 1,800 acts because it's
it's superfluous by the 1700 is like 300
bucks right now you can overclock it and
be pretty competitive with
9 CPU for rendering tasks it does fall
short in some ways like the I mean it's
just slower it's a little bit slower
overall but that makes sense it's got
fewer threads but if you're willing to
sacrifice some of the speed and save a
lot of the money then it's not a bad
trade so that's that's one part of it is
just the perspective provided by AMD now
competition is a good thing now another
thing here
I guess I'll point out the i-5 76 for TX
what was Intel thinking with that my
answer to you is I have no idea I do not
know why and i-5 would exist on the X
299 platform it makes zero sense all of
the motherboards will be more expensive
than the CPU and it's Intel's reasoning
if you didn't see our 77 40 X review
here's what they told us at their press
event when we said why does KB like X
exists with almost exact words their
answer was that it was a CPU built with
the intention of someone getting it to
get into the high-end desktop enthusiast
platform at a lower price okay so you're
buying a 300 plus dollar motherboard and
a 200 something $40.00 CPU with an i-5
or 3:30 with i7 and replacing it with an
i-9 later who does that
that has got to be the smallest possible
market they could target other than just
desktops in general I guess and that
leads into the next point which is Intel
for a while now has been less focused on
the desktop market as a whole
enthusiasts are really helping out the
computer market right now our audience
and our demographic the enthusiast
audience is really the only one that's
profitable growing and driving sales in
desktop computers the best buy
off-the-shelf desktop computer is dead
no one buys those anymore if they go to
a store and you're kind of a to use
kingpins term from our interview there a
daily a daily user you go to a store you
probably buy a laptop most people so
that just leaves really enthusiasts and
production studios
who are buying desktops and intel has
been in it a long time and they've been
in a lead for a long time and they have
so much money that they've died or at
least they have assets I should say that
they've diversified across other areas
and some of them they've not done so
well mobile certainly has been failed a
number of times at this point by Intel
but they're trying to diversify
self-driving cars for instance and
that's because Intel can see the write
on the walls I know that desktop is not
going to be around forever at least for
the consumer audience it's not worth
really targeting for them enthusiasts
you would hope would be worth targeting
but ultimately as much as we can say
that we and you and our audience we're
all driving growth in this sector the
fact of the matter is that enthusiasts
desktop users are probably like 1% of
the market the rest is things like
Enterprise which is a far more
profitable sector of the market Intel
targets that still pretty well though
they've got epic to look out for soon
but that's part of it so to kind of
recap those I five no idea what they're
doing
the IEEE 777 40 X they say is for
upgrading later we don't agree with that
it's kind of misguided especially
because they took out the IGP and that's
one of the things where if you're going
to upgrade later you'd probably upgrade
the GPU later and that's not on there so
you'd have to buy one anyway the
technology is more or less fine it's
definitely got some flaws but they're
the same flaws we've seen in the past
with cable ecit non ex and and then
you're looking at basically just the
desktop market drying up in a way that
Intel a long time ago probably started
shifting gears and saying we need to we
need to make sure we have a safety net
if this thing really collapses so I
think that's a lot of it the PCIe wane
count was certainly kind of a weird
decision for some of the processors or
the lane counts lower then maybe needs
to be I don't know that it's the worst
decision they've made I think it's kind
of blown a little out of proportion and
but that's not to say it's not a problem
it's just of all the things to
to pick on Intel for there are plenty of
other options right now I would like to
see I would like to see enough pressure
on Intel with regard to thermals that
they start moving to either better
thermal compound or to solder or
something like that for these larger
dyes I don't know if the whole launch is
kind of weird it's it's weird for a lot
of reasons that we kind of discussed -
in the ex 299 coverage is remarkably
poor performing video where X 299 is
confusing people who aren't dedicated
followers of technology because they're
like what the heck X 399 is out why
aren't you covering that that's hard
enough for people and then it's also got
a new socket that is is used for what
should be in 1151 part if you look at
the KB like X part they have basically
an 1150 one substrate on top of a 2066
substrate all the way down to the golden
arrow in the corner so I don't know
that's kind of just some loose
unstructured thoughts on all of it you
want more of the structure you can go to
the reviews of course 7740 x reviews up
pretty critical 3900 X review was very
critical of Intel's marketing which is
just something that we do in general but
the marketing was was kind of was kind
of bad for this launch so I don't they
need to get their stuff together they
really need to give their marketing
together especially because it's just
there are things that the CPUs do well
that weren't mentioned and there are
things that the CPUs don't do better
than existing products on the market
that were mentioned as champions of the
new line like VR when we clearly show
that that's not the case they can pretty
much everything at up a higher price
class 300 and up to do VR just PI so I
that's loose thoughts they're very
quickly the question I've seen in a few
places why are there no GPS on sales
because the cryptocurrency boom as I
understand it there was some kind of
shuffling in other markets
internationally I think I read that
India and China had some big influence
on the value of crypto currencies right
now and so you've got a boom and because
GPUs are used
to mine it's called if you're not
familiar used to mine the cryptocurrency
they're selling out everywhere because
people who do mining as a dedicated way
of either making money or just a hobby
or whatever they bought all the cards
because the gaming cards just happened
to be pretty good at mining as well so
they're not in stock and this has
happened before
it happened in 2014 when there was a
boom last time there was a big crash
after that and the market was flooded
with video cards so if you are building
a new system I am so sorry for the
market you're entering right now because
you're you're building a system at a
time when Ram prices are high and there
are no video cards so that kind of sucks
my advice to you would be wait a little
bit on the GPUs if you catch one when it
restocks somewhere and it's not
overpriced then just pick it up I guess
you can also check for use GPS or B
stock this is something a lot of people
forget about
so other than just actually used from
Craigslist or whatever GPUs a lot of the
video card vendors will sell these stock
and are my RMA or open-box cards so you
could go to for example EVGA has a V
stock listing on their site where they
have basically cards that were one take
away from a stock or being sold retail
maybe they've been refurbished sent in
by a user needed to replace thermal pads
or whatever and they put up for sale
that's an example of B stock card so
check places like that it's not a bad
deal right now have to buy something
like a 980 TI for hopefully a little
less than 200 bucks and or right around
there anyway and use that in the interim
and then maybe spend it later for
another 150 or whatever you get out of
it but otherwise I'd say wait or buy buy
used if you can find something that's
cheap 10th Oct eyes are still an ok
price so that's that's good they're not
that great at mining I guess so a 1050
TI might be a good fallback card if you
can use it and then throw it in another
system later and upgrade but that's the
answer to that one now the first
question from our audience as opposed to
just the Internet in general is from
beat n rain
who said Big Ben loved the videos my
question is pretty simple I was
wondering if there was some basic
protocol for cleaning dust from a
graphics card
I've been 980ti do for cleaning I do not
have the experience of taking off the
air cooler unit is there a standard way
to clean it without removing the cooler
and is there anything to avoid or be
wary of I don't want to damage it with
pressured air when I should be using a
safer method so a few things here it
depends on the card some of the I don't
I don't know that I've seen it on NVIDIA
cards
lately but on some of the XFX and
Sapphire cards you can actually really
easily just remove the fan so that's one
thing to keep in mind for some of you
and if you can do that then great you
don't really need to do anything else
pull the fan out now if it's a blower
design reference card it's a little
harder to get in there and get the dust
out I would probably recommend starting
with the compressed air anti-static
compressed air is what you should start
with places like staples salad
anti-static compressed air try and blow
that through there if you know it's bad
inside then it's not too terribly
difficult to remove the leftmost part of
the shroud so we have videos of the
process but there are maybe I want to
say eight screws involved in that
process and they are allen key screws
for the reference card you pull those
out and then the shroud is just metal
you're not going to hurt it it's a piece
of metal you're there's no there's no
issue of shorting anything so you pull
that out obviously the card is unplugged
at this point and hopefully on a non
insulating surface so like a hardwood
table or something like that
technically wood can insulate but you
get the idea and not not carpet and once
you've gotten that off then you have
direct access to the vapor chamber or
the heatsink and you can just blow the
can on that and get everything out of
there alternatively for people with
axial air cooled cards like the dual air
design actually this is kind of what I'm
talking about
a common design anymore 7850 so with a
card like where you've got a fan more
like this maybe two of them there are
and there are on this one three screws
that if you move the blades just right
you'll see them there Phillips screws on
every card I've worked with and you just
remove those screws and you can pull the
fan out you have to be a little bit
careful because it's not necessarily
easy to get the fan back in there so try
to be careful about how you move the
cable or if you move the cable but if
you can just loosen it enough that it's
no longer stuck against the heatsink you
can spray that off or maybe get an
anti-static cloth in there and clean all
the all the dirt up like basically
basically a static clean type of thing
but without the static so those are my
suggestions cleaning cards is not that
difficult just be a little adventurous
with the shroud normally the shroud is
not really going to expose you to
anything that you can damage so anything
to watch out for is the cable because
there are cables attached from the
shroud to the board so when you're
removing the shroud don't don't pull the
cables by the wires try and pull by the
base of it or you can snap the cables
out which I've done but the differences
I don't care so that's hope of that
house of that one next one tie finder
says ask games next is hi Steve the
bloatware issue was very informative
what still interested me now I have a
lot of extra software from cam and ext
Corsair link RAM MSI dragon Ohio mystic
light for the GPU g.skill motherboard
software and many other control software
in my system do these slow down the PC
the short answer is maybe it depends on
the software some of its written worse
than others cam used to be really bad
and the HD cam they've gotten a lot
better it still has a lot of problems
with it but it's nowhere near as bad as
it was before the resource intensive
aspect of cam has more
been removed at this point now it's just
general bugginess but it's not like as
resource-intensive as you used to be but
yes it's a problem where you buy a
keyboard and a mouse and a headset from
different vendors and now you have three
software solutions you have to install
to use them I kind of sucks but that's
that's the way they do it because they
want you to buy all from the one vendor
obviously so yes the short answer is it
is definitely going to impact the boot
time if they're launching that boot and
it might impact general CPU utilization
which can impact other things lightly
for example if we run Cinebench and
something like Windows updates running
and taking a couple percent of the
resources in the background we'll
actually see that result the change in
numbers in Cinebench
so that's a really good way to validate
performance with a clean boot versus a
bloated boot but my suggestion would be
you can go into ms config you see amis
config dot exe I think yeah Microsoft
has now moved all of that into task
manager so you can open task manager
click on start up and then comb through
there find anything you do not need
immediately at startup and disable it
and reboot to apply and then once you
boot back in things like let's say let's
say you don't need em aside dragon I
let's say you don't need the MD HD cam
or Corsair link software at boot they
won't boot up your system will start up
at a normal pace and then you launch
someone you need them alternatively you
can create a really simple batch file
and basically do a start command so you
have like disable it from a startup list
and task manager you make a batch file
bat and then you would do a some
basically put in a startup folder a
timeout or something like that delayed
start basically is what I'm after and
launch the software after some time
delay alternatively you could use
windows task scheduler and start
software up there and the reason you
would do that is so you can stagger the
boot so that it boots up quickly and
normally and then maybe five minutes
later you have cam and link pop up that
way you can still do things like get to
Chrome on your email and whatever
immediately when it turns on without any
unnecessary
delay but yeah it's probably impact for
farms next question one one five seven
strange kids said with the recent
announcement of the Xbox one XX claiming
4k for $500 do you think you can try to
put together a build for a similar price
I could achieve the same thing it would
be interesting and interesting spin to
make two rigs one with one new and one
used to try and get the most performance
per dollar possible PS and 60fps was
only promised for forza it was only fair
that you aim for 4k 30 or better that's
reasonable yes this is I like the idea
of doing used and new that's the
probably the most unique angle because I
think there's a straight build ISM to to
immediately understand but here's the
thing we can do that certainly it might
be worth doing I probably wouldn't title
it like console killer or Xbox one is
relevant or whatever because the thing
is they have a place in the market the
consoles and ultimately if you have the
exact same hardware in every single
thing your programming for all the Xbox
and then it's much easier to develop for
and that's why you see the Xboxes and
Playstations and whatever that's out
there able to achieve the level fidelity
they can other than of course things
like cheating with checkerboard
rendering and things like that but they
can achieve that level of fidelity
largely because the developers can
optimize for the shaders because they
know what they are and how they work and
where they are as opposed to a desktop
where you have probably millions of
possible configurations and who knows
what's going on so a in a one to one
configuration a console will probably
most of time beat a PC in terms of
fidelity for frame rate but the PCs are
obviously customizable so you can go a
lot further that's not to say either
one's better it's to say that they're
not necessarily something you need in a
head-to-head all the time because the
consoles feel a different market and
they're very well optimized for because
it's one set of hardware and Microsoft's
controls at all so that makes it easy
for developers which means that you're
probably not going to see in a
you do as well in a desktop as you would
in a console but yeah it's an
interesting idea we can do something
like that I'm sure for what five hundred
bucks we did a build like that recently
with a G 45 60 and a 1050 TI but I think
you could fit in the budget a cheap five
70 or cheap for 70 if the GP prices
weren't crazy right now and you'd
actually be still at around five hundred
dollars that would be a pretty damn
capable rig and the forty five sixty
won't bottleneck those two cards that
much as we test it so I think you can do
it I don't know that I need to do it but
that would be where I'd start and then
in terms of benchmarking that's not
gonna be possible till the thing comes
out but you should be able to beat the
4k 30 with sacrificing all of your
settings time to something like low and
medium we can look into it though I
don't know why you'd want to play 4k
there any of you have a $500 computer
but it would be I guess would be a fun
test and that'd be about to start in the
end of it not necessarily pack people
1080p60 it's definitely possible though
with a four and $500 computers that
we've built and as we showed with the 45
1,650 I build it's not too hard to hit
1080p 60 or even a bit higher than that
I think we're doing 100 FPS an overwatch
at 1080p with some settings tuning so
really not bad 500 bucks
next question very quickly
David Martins says why nvme has four
PCIe slots or lanes when the physical
drive can only read at 600 megabytes per
second wouldn't to buy PCIe B and up so
the thing with this is the DRI there
it's a little convenient but it's kind
of an old topic now nvme is a protocol
PCIe is an interface where you get the
lanes out of just because a drive as a
PCIe drive I can fit it into well let me
rephrase that just because a drive is an
MDOT to drive and fits into an MDOT to
SSD slot does not mean that it will use
anything other than SATA it might just
pull from the SATA interface at which
case you're getting your 500 550 600
megabyte per second limitation if it's
pulling from PCIe and the drive itself
and the controller can handle more for
performance from 600 guys for a second
then you get the boost and if it's nvme
enabled and again the controller and the
nand can keep up then you could use the
four-way PCIe for tap PCIe configuration
to fill something like 2 gigabytes per
second on some of the SSD is not it's
not too common yet but 2 gigabytes per
second is getting more common at least
getting close to it 1 gigabyte per
second is fairly common at this point
and achievable so you can definitely
leverage the lane count but again it's
got to be something that's not using the
SATA interface or protocol over a
different interface like MDOT - next
question lessor this is the last one
last question for now is from Chettle
one week ago asked can you please do 4k
uploads I'd like to see your hair in as
much detail as possible
well channel good news for you we
upgraded cameras so talk about this in a
separate video but new cameras their 4k
is now a thing we can do
4k 60 because I can't stand 30fps so I
guess your wish has been fulfilled
