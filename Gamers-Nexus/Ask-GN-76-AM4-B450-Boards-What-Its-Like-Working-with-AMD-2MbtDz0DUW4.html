ask Tian it's been a little while if you
forgot how the rules of this game work
post your questions in the comment
section below I will try to get to them
in a future episode we are filming two
back-to-back technically three episodes
back-to-back right now we've got this
one we have the patreon extended edition
which will be available to patreon
backers at patreon.com slash gamers
Nexus then we have another public Sen so
we're filming two in a row because we
had so many questions that were good
from the last episode that we decided to
make two back-to-back you can leave your
questions in this one or in the next one
it doesn't matter
I'll check both for the next episode but
we will be posting these pretty close to
each other and the patreon one will go
live at the same time as this one for
patreon backers before that this is
brought to you by the msi gtx 1080
gaming X and Nvidia's GeForce experience
which allows you to retro actively
capture key gameplay moments with
shadowplay convert captures into gifs
with new tools and apply filters to
games hashtag no filter Emma sighs
gaming X PCBs are high quality with well
built power management and coolers that
we've previously recommended learn more
at the links in the description below so
this first question is pretty good cuz
it's so straightforward supe asks when
can we expect be for 50 boards for the
rise in 2000 series is the common delay
and mid to low tier boards simply
because high-end enthusiast boards sell
better or have higher profit margins no
that's that's not why and actually the
high end is pretty expensive there's a
lot of R&amp;amp;D money that goes into a high
end BIOS the Z series and X series
boards to some extent do have more
features that cost more money to
validate so no that's not the reason
typically it comes down to what the CPU
maker does so in town pushed it's 8700 K
first and the push that's r7 high-end
CPUs first r5 is kind of with it but
none of the really low-end stuff yet and
with the original rise in launch it was
the r7 is exclusively first
so what you end up with is the CPU
makers want to push their halo product
you need a high on board to go with the
halo product to get the most attention
to kind of if it doesn't move units the
point of a halo product is just to get
the markets attention so that like if
you look at the
and Corsair obsidian cases the original
ones that's a hailer product because
idea is you look at it and you go I want
that but I can't afford it and you wait
and eventually the lower end one comes
out in the same series and you buy that
instead because the first one convinced
you to buy it or the users who did spend
the money on it are so impressed with
the quality because is an expensive
product that they will become your
evangelists as the manufacturer and tell
everyone Corsair or whomever makes great
quality blah blah blah and promote it on
the forums for you so typically the
companies like to come out with halo
products first which means that the high
end boards come out first just because
they go together the CPU vendors do
ultimately dictate everything for the
most part for the motherboard makers as
for the question oh and also coffee like
recently was a bit odd in that the low
end boards were delayed into the like
two quarters away from launch or more so
that was odd because Intel pulled in all
their launches last year X 299 was
supposed to launch later than it did by
a number of weeks I used to have the
details out of my head I think it was
like there was at least three weeks
earlier than it was supposed to be and
then coffee like same thing that got
pulled in but validation was still being
done on everything else so you end up
with the low-end chipset shipping later
so that's a lot of that when does be 450
come I don't have official information
I'm not under any embargoes or NDA's
with AMD but they probably wouldn't put
me under one anyway right now so what I
can tell you is that realistically you
look at kind of when companies tend to
launch stuff Computex is right around
the corner we're booking meetings for it
already
Computex is the show that happens in
Taiwan every year Taipei specifically
and will be there
it starts on June 5th this year and we
typically get there a bit early so I
would anticipate that you'll see new
boards and new products in general
around Computex
time because that is a great opportunity
for them to launch stuff because they'll
have all the media in one place now
whether or not that's when they launch
is a different story
typically it's more of an unveil and
then they launch later so we may be
seeing prototypes at that point but I
guess the point is if you're thinking of
buying something and you're trying to
figure out if you buy or wait context is
really close so if you can wait it might
be worth it but that's not me being coy
I don't know something you don't I'm
just saying that's typically when stuff
actually does launch but of course if
you're happy with your options right now
then just buy right now is some changes
all the time anyway but yeah basically
my answer is it's not because profit
margins and probably Computex is one
we'll hear about them but I don't know
that's when they launch Lazarus the
adventurer says SGN hey Steve can you
tell us some realistic ways that the GPU
market might come back in its normal
state
with new GPS now and then and reasonable
price availability is there a way out at
this point it's really out it's a really
depressing way to phrase that they stare
away out of the bad G view prices yeah I
mean this comes down in the memory just
as much as it does the GPUs because we
were talking recently about how I had a
memory supplier telling me directly off
the record of course but directly saying
to me we're making more money than ever
or it seems like we have more money than
God was one of the little quotes out of
out of the person's mouth so I would say
the memory companies have quite a
stranglehold on the industry right now
and they're doing very well it's not
like they're struggling they'll tell you
they have limited cleaner space limited
fabrication capabilities to meet the
demand those could be true but what's
also true is they're raking in cash like
crazy and GPUs invariably have memory
that go with them and that cost money so
to put it back into perspective for you
let's talk money because you're asking
about money so memory on a GPU gddr5
costs nine easily nine dollars per eight
gigabit module if you have eight
gigabytes of memory you have eight of
those modules so
that alone is a good chunk of change
especially considering previously off of
that 8 gigabyte quantity the cards were
20 to 30 dollars cheaper to produce just
last year so a couple dollars cheaper
per module basically you're looking at
what is that that's like 2 to 3 bucks
depending put your on 20 ish dollars 20
24 something like that
so you're anywhere from 2 to 4 dollars
cheaper per module last year than now
and that hurts because the in the very
least the board vendors of course are
going to charge you for that they're not
gonna lose money on it
at most they might up charge you because
I mean there's a cost to them acquiring
the product too they don't just pay the
cost of the product they pay someone to
pay for the cost of the product so that
affects price a lot and I have some
other numbers to it I have no time I'm
conveniently so nine dollars easily per
HBM mod or sorry GGG are five module is
what you're paying for eight gigabit and
that puts us at let's say you have eight
of them so 72 bucks right for that
that's a really expensive card already
then you have the GPU cost the silicon
cost that hasn't really changed very
much what we understand you have the PCB
not really that expensive DRM good ones
go up to like 50 bucks cost coolers like
50 bucks for a good one
so cards get expensive fast but memory
is the one major variable cost has gone
up more than twenty or thirty dollars to
consumers so other things that have
impacted price to maintains one of them
giant scapegoat is crypto mining
everyone likes to kind of ignore the
memory prices they like to ignore the
fact that the board partners don't even
want to buy GPS right now because their
new GPUs literally around like months
away so know everyone's afraid to fill
their shelves with cards and get stuck
with them so those two things are a
factor
and I guess to some extent although it
is escaped crypto mine of course is a
factor so memory price crypto mining to
an extent and new GP is coming out which
is I've kind of given dates already but
I'll get more into detail on those soon
I have other prices where eh p.m. you
may have noticed Vega is never really
for the most part been the price it was
supposed to be well H p.m. is expensive
AMD was expecting from what I understand
from what my source has told me to get
there HB m24 high for for under $30 not
gonna give an exact number cuz you can
draw the lines but under $30.00 what
they're expecting that memory caused 65
from directly from the source I know
that so quite a bit higher than what the
original plan was because the price of
the memory went up during the period of
Vega being created and planned for
Samsung's eight high HP MT memory 120
plus dollars for that so HP m is
exceedingly expensive I don't have g5x
numbers I wish I did but I do have GDR
six numbers and that's 20% higher than
gddr5 so take the moving target price of
gddr5 and add 20% that's your price so
yeah a lot of factors but the answer
your question is there a way out yes and
I I think my main way out is let's see
if the prices are more agreeable family
for family product so if we have a 1080
today that's supposed to be 500 600 when
it launched to be fair then will the
1180 or whatever be also $600 if it's
not if it's increased and it's supposed
to be the same exact like a linear
product in terms of product stack a 1080
is to a 980
is to a 780 and so forth then it should
be the same price but if the GPU makers
are factoring this new market condition
into it and trying to condition all of
us into spending more money on video
cards that's where there's a problem
to you I say wait for second dish half
of 2018 and let's see where the new GP
is take us but otherwise now Nvidia and
Andy can both increase their GPU
production but if the board vendors
aren't buying them from Nvidia AMD
they're not gonna do it so there's no
easy way out unless someone decides to
also I'll save this for first a lynnae's
opposed I have some exclusive
information that's that I've been
sitting on for a little while collecting
I'll share this later but there's I have
a lot more information on this topic
specifically and it's interesting enough
that it deserves its own content pieces
check back for that later next question
piers H says 5th time asking sorry I get
a lot of comments for those of us who
don't use patreon object to the
additional fees for those outside the US
and the UK for example or who don't want
to use patreon is it possible to donate
via an alternative method for example
would you accept two dollars per month
via PayPal or another method maybe a
lump sum so forth a blank item on your
store I'm open to ideas but I really
dislike patreon and we got another one
like this for Mike st's you said another
sort of asked UN what's the best way to
support you and your content or channel
as in the best dollars per way to
sponsor might be hard to answer I'm
gonna take both of these first question
thank you for posting note especially
for posting at five times I understand
your concern patreon is pretty good to
us but if you don't want to use it for
some reason then because of it as a
direct result of your question and I
appreciate it
I added a donate button to the store so
if you go to store documents Nexus Don
that we would of course prefer that you
get something for your money that's why
it's there I'd like you to have
something in return
but maybe you only want to give us two
or three dollars or something you don't
want to buy you know $20 shirt or
whatever then you can go to the store in
the bottom left this donate button and I
I mean I got all of that except for the
pay pot the PayPal or whatever credit
card processing fees so that's probably
the best way to donate if you truly want
to donate I would love for you guys to
actually get something for your money
though so patreon
is a good way for us to have a system
that we can give people different things
so like access to special videos like
the ask GaN extended edition and they're
not meant to be that special because we
don't want to take content away from the
main channels just the extra content but
that wouldn't be made otherwise so that
patreon is the only way we do that right
now same for the behind the scenes stuff
which is infrequent but interesting and
we have a couple of other things like
discord access but I totally understand
if you don't like patreon and we have a
donate button now so if you want to use
it store documents taxes net if you
don't want to pick up a product buttons
in the bottom left we very much
appreciate it that kind of stuff goes
towards keeping up some business letting
me do stuff like buy cases and tighten
B's or whatever when we're not on review
list now Mike gasps T's your question
was actually pretty interesting how much
what's the best way to give us money so
again the best way to give money is I
guess kind of depends on your definition
if it's which method of giving money
gets us the most of it
is that obviously a straight donation
patreon takes 5% so you use super chat
this is so this is just some
transparency for you it's not me trying
to pitch get give me money it's me
saying this is how the system works in
the world that we all live in the tech
world patreon five percent off the top
not bad at all
they give us a lot of tools in exchange
that 5% I'm totally fine with it the
next method would be super chat
livestream super chat haven't checked
recently if at last I checked super chat
takes 30% so I don't know if that's
current anymore it probably is but they
take 30% so that it's quite a big chunk
and then there's also what are the other
methods Adsense it's not something you
give us money through Adsense you watch
the ads but YouTube takes 45 percent of
that totally fair they host the platform
they host all of our data and I think I
had some other stuff I jot it down too
so the store obviously the store we get
all of the money that you spend when you
buy something I still have a
cost to buy the thing that you bought so
obviously I'm not if I have a margin of
let's say between 10 and 30% on
something I'm getting 10 and 30% profit
on what you bought however I already
have the product it's sitting there in
inventory so if you're thinking I want
to give them $20 I don't know if I
should give them 20 bucks or buy a shirt
we would prefer if you have space in
your wardrobe let you buy the shirt
because I'm technically getting a lower
profit because I had a cost to create
the shirt and distribute it but the
shirts sitting there in inventory anyway
so I'd rather it move I don't want it to
sit there forever so yeah that's I think
that kind of answer is most of it but
PayPal takes a lot of money every $2 you
give us through PayPal directly they
take 36 cents so that's why we added the
donate button directly and if you use a
credit card instead of PayPal I think
the fee is lower but I'm honestly not
sure it's brand new I haven't tried it
yet
so I'm gonna try next question this is
post on patreon hello gamers Nexus I
would like to ask more about the reason
why you were cut out and had to buy rise
in 2nd gen samples this is a video from
tech of tomorrow they linked the video
about AMD trying to control the process
and nature of testing some other tag
tubers have replied in the comments
either in support or against seeing as
you guys didn't get samples could it be
AMD is simply not bothering to send
samples to those reviewers they already
know can't dictate testing methodology
first off I did not watch that
particular video but I have been made
aware of it we acquired rise in 2nd gen
samples as a correction and as for the
rest and these had a lot of staffing
changes lately in especially in terms of
media relations so it's actually getting
better they're getting easier to work
with as a company the new staff we've
been working with have been easier to
work with and more agreeable so while
they've all they for the most part
they've been pretty agreeable as
individuals it's more problem of what
the company tries to force down through
those staff members and how much
pushback those staff members have
versus the higher-ups so this is true
for all of the companies in the industry
it altima t comes down to how much power
do the people we interface with have
when they're challenging their
management and saying like no this is
this is wrong we shouldn't do it this
way
and it looks like AMD's genuinely
getting better in that regard this is
all kind of like invisible changes you
would never really see it as a customer
there's no reason you would think about
it but marketing has been changed up PR
has been changed up media relations
upper management like director level
marketing has changed so it's looking
better I'm hoping that they're easier to
work with the reason we weren't included
in rise in second gen is because I had
an issue with the way Andy did their
thread Ripper embargo lifts they had
multiple like they not just unbox and
review but it was like unboxing and then
like installation guide embargo and
review embargo and then in between those
you had a couple of media outlets that
got to post their review ahead of the
review embargo lift but it was permitted
explicitly by AMD or their partners and
enabled by their partners and to
actually every extent IMD as well so I
took issue with that I spoke to them and
I was like you can't have a special like
approved friends of AMD embargo lifts
and then everyone else embargo lifts
because I'm sitting here on the same
data that there's other people just
published but I'm not allowed to publish
it it's already out there they published
it you allowed them to do it why can't I
why is that line drawn we both had the
product at the same time we both have
the data we both have an embargo but
theirs is earlier than mine so here's
the thing and this is the conversation I
had with them it's okay if you don't
want to send me the product it's okay if
you don't want me to post a review on
the same day as the other people because
I'm not entitled to a free product I can
buy it it's okay I'm a big boy we have a
company that
generates money based off of creating
content we can justify buying a product
it's not complaining about that it's
complaining about the ethics of special
embargo is even though everyone has the
same information so it's suppression and
that's the problem I had with it so I
explained that I said it's fine next
time don't send it to me because I don't
want to sit there with information sit
on my hands and watch other people get
to post it when when the rest of us who
aren't on the special list aren't
allowed to and so they didn't they
didn't send us the stuff and that's fine
I literally asked for that and preferred
it to be that way because I mean frankly
if if there's no like unspoken
understanding from the representatives
that we're going to comply to rules that
I don't agree with that I can do
whatever the hell I want and we actually
did wait for the embargo to list because
my word I gave AMD they their
representative gave me their word at the
time we won't do this again with the
special embargoes and this was back when
the thread report thing happened and I
said okay fine I'm not on publishing my
thermal data because I disagree with all
of this anyway and I can't take your
word for anything because it's already
been done however what I will do is I
will give you my word that when I get
products in advance and I will without
your help that we will not publish the
data unless we see early embargoes for
special people so they in fact did keep
their word and I kept mine so I would
say things are improving quite a bit I
wanted to clear that up because I've
seen a lot of posts on like on forums
and stuff where people speculate about
why we went the way we did with rising
second-gen and with the AAP use and
they're also Iran is so yeah no that's
that's it I mean it's I disagreed with
their thread Ripper stuff I chose to
fight the battle and I chose to get off
the review samples because I knew that
they wouldn't like how I handle
the situation but I had a point to make
and I made it and lo and behold risin to
is much better so thank you AMD for
listening to my point new staff are
great I'm really looking forward to
working with them more relationships
building back up so yes I would say and
that's that's my take I have there's so
much more I could say but that's
specifically to the topic of what tech
of tomorrow was talking about about
working with Andy that's kind of the the
last couple of months of my experience
there's no need to go back further
because all the staff has changed for
the most part so when people change the
company more or less changes to some
extent anyway so that's my version of
his story they've gotten a lot better
and it's our job as media to not allow
those kinds of things to influence our
reviews clearly it didn't because I was
pretty positive about second gen I was
pretty positive about the AP use and
that's after having a bitter hot debate
over how thread over was handled and we
were positive by the way about thread
Ripper
so I would say we've succeeded at not
allowing it to impact the view of the
product the product didn't do anything
wrong
but I there are two different things we
stand for there's like there's a
consumer and the product review how old
is the product to you and then there is
the company and making sure that they
are not bad to work with so we we kind
of fought both those battles at the same
time and it turned out pretty well I'm
very happy with it
and all that stuff's like behind the
scenes you don't typically talk about it
happens all the time happens with all
the companies we pick and choose battles
we fight a lot of them behind the scenes
argue with people over like know your
this is wrong you shouldn't do this
this is unethical or this is just really
messed up like here's all of our reasons
why it's not stuff we publish it's just
like you try to work with the people and
make sure everyone understands each
other so you can come to a reasonable
agreement and compromise of how the
industry should work of course
the manufacturers ultimately have the
most power but we're independent so also
I can do whatever I want
the next question is awesome gamer 909
anatec recently found HP ET settings
could massively impact performance on
Intel i7 800 Kay's 8700 Kay's I guess I
have you booked into HP t th HP ET
excuse me and related settings at all
yeah we discovered that about a year ago
and we're an enthusiast site so we
benchmark with settings that make sense
for our audience and II I believe asked
for HP e T to be disabled for either
Rison or thread Ripper I think thread
Ripper Intel has asked for it to be
disabled and wise they asked I don't
mean they said like it needs to be off I
mean they said hey we found these
performance problems you should turn it
off and both the company said that so we
we kind of found that before they talked
to us about it with X and $2.99 I think
the 1,700 X when we first encountered
that before publication and we
encountered it again with all of our
Hardware bought competitive overclocking
where it can mess up some of the
performance with certain tests we're
running out next $2.99 so yeah we've
already accounted for HP ET and all of
our testing and discovered it a while
ago
Radley Peterson stn are some reviewers
or media outlets friends who are who are
some of your friends
oh also thanks for highlighting my
comment I know you have a pretty high
standard that's why I'm subscribed thank
you for subscribing yeah we are friendly
with with most of the folks you're
probably familiar with the thing I'll
reason I'm putting this question here
I'm not gonna go through a name like
name people specifically but the reason
I'm putting it here is because obviously
we're all competitors we're all going
for China the same audience you might
watch my 2700 X review or not someone
else's you might watch someone else's
but not mine at the end of the day
you're not gonna watch 30 of them so we
are competing but there's a lot of value
to still working together a lot of us
will talk with each other before reviews
and just say like I need a sanity check
please help me does this look like what
you're seeing because these products you
have to remember unreleased there's no
forum but
or anything like that so we try to work
together even though your competitors
your friendly competitors and it's not
like the really large corporations we
all try to kill each other
it's a lot different when it's a bunch
of small individuals who are who are
trying to represent the consumer and I
also wanted to point out that to some
extent there's a lot of value in being
friendly with your competitors in this
kind of position because we are in a
less powerful position than the
companies that provide the product
reveiw or that we acquire it whatever
because ultimately the companies don't
need any of us they can can find the way
to create new influencers if they have
to people disappear they'll make sure
new ones rise up but that's the same
reason that the media outlets that we
talk with that are out there it's best
to try and work together on stuff and
and kind of keep an eye out for each
other for when the companies do try to
pull shady so that we can all band
together on it when it's important and
hopefully you just kind of hope that the
companies get enough feedback from us
before product launches that that they
will change their minds and that's why
there's value and being friendly with
your competition or being friends with
them so yeah but the answer is yes of
course we're we see these people I see a
lot of a lot of people that that you
guys watch the post up to YouTube I
steal out of them more per year and I
see local friends because we travel so
much to see each other at all these
shows so yeah of course you should get
friendly with them next question I think
that's the last one last two
TJ CCB are 47 says do you think the
constant shift and Radeon brand did harm
to Andy of the long run they had since
2007 Radeon HD 2000 87,000 r9 200 300 r9
fury I get your point
rx 400 500 now RX Vega and video on the
other hand use GeForce GTX since 12 2008
it's so hard to say and ATI had a pretty
strong brand aim the e had developed
pretty strong branding I would say
towards the throughout the HD series and
into the r9 eventually our nine series I
it's I am NOT I don't have a firm answer
for you I'm going to kind of take it off
the top but I would say that perhaps
early on there might have been I don't
want to say the words harm to the brand
but here's the way I see it if you keep
changing the name of your stuff the
average consumer who builds a computer
every three years and doesn't watch
youtube videos daily or weekly even
someone who they build their computer
and they play games on it and ignore all
this stuff for three years now they come
back and they build a new computer I
think that person might be affected by
name changes because it say on video did
it if you bought a gtx 8800 and you come
back three years later and you can't
find anything labeled gtx anymore there
might be a moment of at least trying to
figure out like wait a minute what
happened to nvidia but i'm sure you
figure it out eventually but i don't i
would have to say lightly and hesitantly
yes i think there has been brand impact
but it's so hard to say whether it's
been positive or negative I could
totally see the negative because you
might have built a positive reputation
on the brand and you change the name I
could see the inverse where perhaps you
thought you had a negative reputation on
it and you change the name so I have no
idea but yes I do think there's been
impact last question Gore gula while
manufacturing the mod matte the Gion mod
matte how was your experience with
language and cultural barriers in
regards to product communication
negotiating prices and shipping this is
a fun question so the mod matte on the
table here the GN anti-static mod by
it's not not an easy product to make it
turns out thought it would be we had a
lot of requirements for it things like
so we want a really anti-static
est Matt and it's made by one a factory
that makes them for clean rooms we want
a real Matt and we also want to print on
it and typically an industrial factory
that's why I say industrial I mean
literally they're making things for
industry that makes anti-static mats
they're not printing on it because the
clean rooms and whatever that use these
anti-static services they don't they
don't need cool branding they don't need
cheat sheets it's just a work surface
and so when we went to that when we said
we want to print on this they were
basically like your customers won't like
it they literally said your customers
won't like that we would recommend you
don't do that they won't like it if you
print on it because it's supposed to
look like a plain mat and we're like no
you don't get it it's like it's this
whole branding thing and YouTube and
just could you please just just print on
it please okay so we we explained it to
that kind of it wasn't like arguing but
we were just going back and forth
because you got language barriers you
kind of have to learn how much English
your representative speaks and try and
step down the sort of like grade level
and they have to step down there I've
been working on a bit of Mandarin so
they have to bring that down so that I
can understand whatever and at the end
of the day hopefully you both kind of
can bring your language down to a simple
enough level that you both understand
each other and that's not always easy
with products that have really specific
requirements and words that might not
translate or that you don't know like
different terms for like I didn't really
have another term for the word
anti-static mat or mod mat or anything
like that so I but it's been fun because
some of the challenge is communication
we go to Taiwan every year Taipei
because of that I've been working on
trying to pick up some really basic
Mandarin like I'm at a point where I'm
basically like a toddler I can point out
stop and say like like I want that or I
want this or don't put tomatoes on my
feet please
so that's been part of learning to work
with the companies on making the
products we're making we have others in
the pipe to other challenges negotiated
price and shipping shipping it was kind
of interesting because you have the boat
or the plane option where we learn the
boat can take like like sixty days to
clear the ports and everything and a
plane is 10 to 12 but you pay an
enormous amount more money to put a
bunch of four to six pound mats on a
plane and ship those so yeah that's been
something we had to learn as well and
negotiating price is it's pretty easy
they give you a number you give them
another number and then you each send
crying emojis to each other until you
meet in the middle
I had to send a handshake in my budgets
pretty sour experience with it but yeah
if you want to buy wine you can back
order its toward octane razaaq's has
done that for the mod mat otherwise
