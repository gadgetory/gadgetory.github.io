one X once we are inside of the same the
plan is to put some thermocouples on it
the thermal testing and just a teaser
here we have some new tools that will
allow us to begin benchmarking console
games so you'll want to subscribe for
that but this thing supposedly has a
vapor chamber inside of it it is quite a
bit of mass in an otherwise small body
so the plan is to dismantle it show you
how that process works and then we're
gonna be looking at the thermal solution
more closely along with the other
components within and if you are worried
that the new Xbox one X would not have
ventilation large enough for roaches to
crawl into and die in we just bought a
used old one for parts and that's what
was in there
good news they can still do that so if
you buy one from a pawn shop like we did
keep that in mind before getting to that
this coverage is brought to you by EVGA
and NVIDIA with the destiny to 1080 TI
bundle a 1080i SC to comes with a
synchronous fan control for its dual
fans and nine thermal sensors and again
includes destiny to learn more at the
link in the description below so the
Xbox one X we just picked up this is
brand new just to clarify the one from a
pawn shop is the previous Xbox 1s
whatever it was and we bought that so
that will have the old cooler the heat
pipe plus aluminum finned usual heatsink
this one's got a vapor chamber heatsink
if we can swap them we'll try it out
just to see how effective it actually is
but that depends on the mounting spacing
so this thing looking at it straight
away has two screws in the back but if
you don't know the specs already from a
PC hardware enthusiasts perspective it's
basically got a more powerful rx Polaris
chip in it so this has four TCU's
whereas for reference and rx 580 has
thirty sixty years each CU has 64 cores
so with 40 verses 36 there's a decent
power uplift in terms of performance and
in terms of other specs that are derived
from that it means that you end up with
2560 stream processors versus 23:04 64
for CU and assuming the same layout on
this version of Polaris
as on desktop you would also be at 160
texture map units RTM use as opposed to
the previous count which is you just
multiply four by the Cu count and that
would also give us a texture fill rate
of 275 Gigot axles per second as opposed
to 193 Giga texels per second previously
which you can calculate because it's
just the clock multiplied by the TM use
and the Xbox one X has a clock of 1720
megahertz so again for perspective with
the clock of 17 20 megahertz we're a
couple hundred megahertz over rx 580
clocks making it pretty interesting and
it's also got a faster it has more
memory bandwidth that 326 gigabytes per
second as opposed to 256 and being in a
console it's gonna be hand tuned for by
the game developers so should be pretty
difficult to beat cost for cost with a
PC these days thanks to the D Ram prices
and GPU prices and things like that but
let's take it apart see what it looks
like inside because that's what's gonna
matter so first off we have the
up screws and we're gonna need to find
one of these which I think we actually
do have this head I mean it'll work yeah
this torque sound will definitely work
but it's pretty rounded out ahead
alright one I think there's probably one
hidden in here so same screw type
alright okay two screws out anything
else or is that it now I should note
picking oh well well there's our next
step picking this up at the store the
attendant told me oh you got the Scorpio
version that has large letters on it and
in big letters it says project Scorpio
on it
alright so this slides forward this is
actually pretty nice so far in terms of
easy to manage design there you go it's
got rails on it so rails here our two
screws socket back there
ventilation ports oh no it's actually
facade over here some ventilation here
none on the front to facade
oh no it's real on the side okay so
you've got side ventilation and facade
on the front and underneath that we have
this we use Torx ten a second ago looks
like about the same things gonna work
here yes oh so I can already tell you
that based on this pattern here I'm
thinking that's the vapor chamber start
with the start with the silver screws oh
man that's that's enough to kill a
vampire with these this one does not
okay so these longer ones have a
flattened out head if you look at the
ones near it it's got the rounded screw
head so that makes them easy to spot so
we're gonna start with just removing all
those with the flatter head and then see
if the cage comes free I'm thinking all
the other parts are secured to that okay
so this is a very easy job apparently
this right here is what's securing us at
this point so I think when you smaller
head for that okay it's your nine dude
no no that's right
ribbon cable up here so we're gonna
disconnect that by pulling that out and
pulling that down just like a laptop and
then this thing just comes out or that
does actually connect to something as
well so what is that we don't know yet
this goes over to the IR receiver
so there's your remote basically
infrared receiver and then over here
what is this this anything yet okay so
what is this oh USB should have looked
on the side of the thing we can have the
front of the console would have revealed
that I'll just put that back in there
isn't a real reason to remove it okay so
internal housing pretty easy we can move
that to the side I don't really need
that anymore
so this side we've now revealed not
positive what comes out next at this
point we're gonna start with the last of
the flathead screws flathead is and it
has a flat top if anyone was wondering
this unit went through production on
August 30th 2017 so that's how recently
these were made or at least that part
was made anyway
oh that's the hard drive I just loosened
hey hey
yeah hard drives already loose next side
okay cool
it's very easy so far so here's a shell
internal part of it anyway
well it's a ventilation and meshing not
really a big deal all this stuff I do
need to know which week is back on
though and underneath we have a fan that
looks like a 120 might be like a weird
112 or something actually which I
believe I think the original or the
previous Xbox was on a 112 millimeter
fan so it looks like around there we'll
find out blade drive is connected by
SATA standard SATA you can see it right
there and then next that we've got power
it's got a rubber rubber sheath on it
for vibration damping its power supplies
right here this is a 245 watt power
supply I believe and that should just be
a pull to release yep
there's our power supply power connector
245 Watts 2.75 apps
yeah 1.3 amps I'll swear that's about
all you need to know about the battery
so that's an insulated cable going down
this side this is all I'm very
methodical I do have to give Microsoft
credits just coming apart extremely
easily amp and the amp header so yeah
there's our optical drive with the
rubber thing on it a Model D g6 m5s if
anyone needs a replacement one of those
in the future its
d g6 m5s and that connects via SATA to a
SATA header on the board
that's labeled the optical disc drive
SATA a hard drive also connected via
SATA so this is a mobile drive it's a
one terabyte drive retails for $65 on
Newegg kind of twenty eight megabytes of
cash as for the speed only 5400 RPM on
this one data transfer rate up to 140
megabytes per second so if you replace
this with an SSD you're gonna be in
better shape of course but that's not a
surprise to anyone that there's our
drive let's just put that over here they
have actually secured it with rubber
damped hard drive screws let's get this
monster cooler out so here's the fan
listed as a thermal system fan oh one
AKA fan and a heatsink
so the fan of the heatsink assembly is a
a blower fan so that's a blower radial
fan not an axial fan that's for diameter
it might even be like a 100 so 100 to
120 have to remove the fans really no
but or not no 120 102 112 and oh I mean
it's just a it's just a blower fan just
like you would have with a video card
heatsink spins the air just goes through
this channel and that is housing the
vapor chamber which is just an aluminum
heatsink with a copper cold plate that's
got the liquid inside of it so that you
get the phase change so we can remove
this and take a look at that but it's
it's the same as every other vapor
chamber we've ever looked at what is
this this is your power from the wall
that goes down in the corner over here
and power brick is right here all of
this is really modular which is awesome
because that means it's gonna be easy to
replace stuff as a user without
Microsoft's help
so they've numbered these and I think it
has to do with the disassembly process
which is also pretty cool so if we take
a look back here it says fan o one right
there and fan o one would have I mean it
would have been the easiest remove that
first there's accompanied by power O 2
if you can see that and then the blu-ray
drive in front of me is labeled as disco
3 and the hard drive is labeled as hard
drive oh for so seriously big credits
have Microsoft are building a console
that doesn't completely suck to take
apart that's pretty uncommon I'm
labeling the stuff in the order it
disassembles is great it probably helps
there RMA process but it indirectly
helps consumers who are trying to
maintain their own thin so ok let's look
at what's next oh hey it's got the
scorpion on it so that a Master Chief
that's the Master Chief talked about in
the Easter Egg see that master chief
riding a scorpion I don't think that was
in the original tear downs that went on
YouTube this is a alright so we've got a
Master Chief in the corner and let's do
the let's get the vapor chamber off of
here it's got a pretty good cooling
system on it I mean it's just it's a
giant version of a reference card so I
am tempted to play around with it and
see what we can do but for now that's
what's got stock these are smaller
it's a good way to remove this feel like
if you removed this you can rip
components
have to replace that thermal pad it
might be a screw in the opposing side
which that's the case would kind of suck
because I don't have to take the whole
board out I just gotta be another screw
on there's like that what is this anyway
wireless wireless okay anyone through
that so that's Wireless this is a salsa
wireless Wi-Fi to different MAC
addresses it's two different wireless
cards all right that they're all pad is
syncing the bridge the one of the
chipset into the body so some sort of
basic dissipation there this is a flash
module so some onboard storage use for
your probably firmware I think it also
acts as a cache the RM components are on
the other side for the most part that we
have a few inductors around the outer
edge and then let's finally get this
damn thing off somehow Wow looks like
they bent those into place right about
ready to give up on this just stuck one
of these in here
and kind of twisted it like that and lo
and behold it comes off super easily so
I thought this was gonna be like sort of
bent to shape to keep people out but all
you need to do is stick something in
there to to pop it up alright cool
a weird plug to provide resistance and
we should now be able to remove this all
of that pulling later okay
so a bunch of thermal pad whatever the
left of it I'll replace that one and
still have the thermal pads on the vram
so what we have three six eight 12 so 12
gigabytes one gigabit modules they are
Samsung modules so 12 gigabytes of
memory and we have the APU here let's
clean that off that is some hardened
paste taking some lessons from Intel on
that one it's like rubber I'm not sure
that's really gonna do a lot for you
unfortunately we can't test thermals
without removing this stuff this doesn't
have an internal sensor we can access so
we're gonna have to go the thermocouple
route if we do go that route and have
promises yet and that means we can't do
it before and after we can only do an
after but I mean I can pull it off in
plastic pieces so if you ever need to
replace the thermal paste on yours this
is where you'd be just be careful and
not rip off any of the SM DS around the
silicon on the outside don't use your
fingernails too aggressively this thing
is four hours old or less I mean to be
fair that heatsink was date stamped as
July the internal chassis was stamped as
August so it's been made for a while but
so vapor chamber sits atop this and
there is your die or die cover anyway
Wow
it even says 4k in the bottom right or
left rather really so we need 4k on
there what's Xbox one 4k and that is the
APU I'm pretty sure that's what we have
here I think what we have is a four
phase VRM for the GPU and is maybe a
single for the CPU if not a dual but it
really looks like a single and here's
why
they've done the work for us they've
labeled it graphics phase one graphics
phase three graphics phase four drive X
phase two CPU phase no number so yeah I
think that's what we have we have five
total phases actually now yeah five
total phases one of which is for the CPU
and four for the video card okay so
that's pretty much it for the teardown a
couple small things like a PC speaker on
here and then for the vapor chamber I
mean it's it's a vapor chamber it's what
you always see copper plate in the
bottom and aluminum fins on the top and
then it's got a separate aluminum plate
contacting the vrm components which
sinks just into the fin stack it doesn't
actually sink into the vapor chamber
part the copper part in the bottom so
that covers it
that is the Xbox one X it's not too hard
to take apart the only trick is is
popping the retention kit from the back
of this off but once you figure that out
that's pretty easy too so that's it
we're gonna rebuild it now and I'm not
sure about thermal testing not going to
promise it yet but we do have some game
testing planned that may take priority
