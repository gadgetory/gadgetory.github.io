just took a look at some of the Paragon
rendering techniques that Epic Games is
applying through Unreal Engine and this
would be specifically for the character
sparrow in Paragon and so we have some
stills that we took from this talk I'm
just going to compress it a little bit
because there's interesting information
in terms of graphics technology GP
rendering pipeline stuff like that one
of the main things we talked about in
this demonstration Zach Parrish
presented he was talking about the way
hair works within Unreal Engine and
specifically for sparrow in Paragon and
one of those items is of course lighting
lighting sort of does everything in
games these days that looks amazing
without investing too much in geometry
and things that could slow down the
processing on your GPU side and looking
at lighting specifically that engine
uses a deferred rendering pipeline so
the engine compiles all these materials
that are needed for the whatever's being
drawn on the screen it compiles all
those materials and ships that to the
GPU the GPU then creates an image out of
that so a couple interesting notes here
the light enters the hair and there's
all these anisotropic filtering and
different shading techniques that you've
seen in your game settings so AO is one
of those AF is one of those and then
there's also specular items that we see
appearing as well so with specular
there's this sort of highlight effect on
the hair and the light hits the hair and
it creates this almost beam of highlight
across the surface of it and the way
this looks is changed based upon the
roughness factor that is entered into
the engine by the game's developers so
there's a roughness of materials and
with hair they generally increase the
roughness if you decrease it make it
more smooth than it will actually sort
of almost look like a mineral oil effect
was applied to the hair that's not too
realistic so this is a rougher surface
material and that means that the
specular reflection doesn't go quite as
far as it might with a smooth surface so
that is one of the things that we looked
at with hair with Zack parishes
presentation another item was skin and
this one we're more familiar with on the
editorial cycles we've worked with
nvidia and AMD talking about this
specific element with in-game graphics
and that is subsurface scattering so
subscript service scattering
is the effects where light hits skin and
then enters and bounces around within
the skin because skin is not perfectly
opaque as it may sort of appear at a top
level underneath there's cells there's
blood vessels all these things and light
interacts with those and that changes
the color of the skin it changes the way
that the light is perceived by the user
within games the subsurface scattering
effect is somewhat limited right now
because it has to be done in screen
space that means the only items that you
can currently see are affected by
subsurface scattering and the the issue
there is that if you start applying it
globally then it's just it's to abusive
on the video card so subsurface
scattering very cool stuff you can track
previous articles we've written with
nvidia and AMD on that but the top level
here is just that the scatter radius can
be changed with an unreal engine to
modify how far the light scatters how
much the character looks like he or she
is glowing when that light hits the skin
and interacts with it and bounces around
under the surface and then for more
information on these technologies and
the other technologies discussed in the
rendering pipeline during the demo here
at ECG see hit the link in the
description below we've got an article
that covers the talk with a couple of
photos if you're interested in how it
all works so as always thank you for
watching patreon link the petrol video
and leave comments if you have any
questions we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
