hydrographics into msi Seahawk so we
noticed in the new marketing video for
the hydro graphics card on Corsairs
channel that the cold plate used in the
marketing video is actually this one
which is the one we've been talking
about for a while for about a year now
it's got the protruded copper out of the
base it's basically the one that EVGA
uses so this is what was shown in the
new marketing video for the hydrographic
switch the review model we received here
in pieces used this one which is
actually a flat plate cooler and that's
what we reviewed the unit based on so a
few things here wyd why did the change
happen we emailed corsair ask them about
it female down a sigh as well but
haven't really received the real
response yet so we're going off what we
got from Corsair as of now the core
question why did the plate change and
the answer was some of the first units
of seahawks and hydrographics use the
flat base with machine down stand off to
provide better contact with the GPU
surface we changed immediately to the
raised GPU cold plate we had used the
CPU cold plate in previous version with
no issues that did not work for the new
10 series is on video changed some
dimensions for production silicon that
were not seen on pre-production parts so
the short of it basically this is the
same issue we saw when we built our own
GTX 1060 hybrid where the cold plate
didn't reach all the way down into the
base plate of the GPU of the video card
so that aluminum base plate was
providing too much well two parts the
base plate was too high and the GPU
silicon was not high enough so that's
the part that change the GPU silicon has
a shorter height or Z height as we
sometimes call it depend on what you're
talking about and that means that the
cold plate can't as easily access it so
we asked horse or what they did and as
stated there they actually shaved down
these standoffs so it doesn't leave the
a stacks factory like this coarser did
this themselves shave down the standoffs
and if we look at a new model they're
actually I've measured these with some
digital calipers there about an extra
half a millimeter or so shorter on the
Corsair flat plate CLC that's found on
the hydrographic since Seahawk so that
change shrinking these so to speak did
make it so that the cold plate could
mostly contact the silicon the results
were fine as we saw in our review so
really ultimately in that regard for
users who bought the hydrographics it
would appear to be a non-issue because
as we saw in the review the temperature
is still really low it was will put the
chart on the screen now in our
hydrographics versus EVGA hybrid review
when we swapped this cold plate onto the
Seahawk we actually did see a slight
improvement about one degree Celsius
when using the EVGA fan if you use the
coarser fan it would be even a bit
better than that so these do in our
testing perform a bit better coursers
told us that they don't perform a bit
better it just it comes down to I
suppose test methodology and tools we
stand by our testing that we've proven
it a few times now over the years these
are in our testing experience better for
cooling GPUs now the one point they may
have is that the main difference is
coming from the fact that this mounting
pressure is not perfect and that's
partly because the tolerance between the
shade standoffs is a bit larger than the
tolerance of these standoffs on a
factory unit so in our measurements
there was something like a range of 0
point 2 millimeters difference one
height to the next whereas this one with
something like point zero five or
something like that so that could also
be the contributor to the temperature
difference just that's the short of that
so overall not a huge deal with the
corsair unit let me answer a few more
questions that I empties the corsair
will will ring run through them
rapid-fire the main question was why not
make the running change in a way that
just shaves these down from the factory
rather than changing the entire cold
plate and their answer is pretty
reasonable was it's a trade-off between
to land a new standoff or taking off the
shelf cold plate that already existed
for the solution so that makes sense I
can I can get behind that because they
don't want a tool and you stand off it
take have a longer lead time made more
sense for them to buy a different cold
plate the next question I asked was will
Corsair publicly state
change and Corsair said as the function
and feature of this card has not changed
and both cold plate solutions meet the
stated speck of the card we don't plan
to split them as a different skew we've
not upgraded the cold plate it's just a
slight tweak to accomplish the same
result given the resources available at
initial development and extended
production that's the answer that one
the next question was if I buy this card
today which cold plate while you receive
in the mail as a consumer and they said
it could be either they don't really
know for sure depending on what msi's
serial numbers are so right now today it
could be either in a few months time it
will probably be exclusively this plate
just that's how because they're phasing
the other one out next question was the
shaving modification made to all
affected production standoffs that's the
important question right because if this
got through on any sea hawk or
hydrographics units then as a user you
are going to be off contact of the GPU
silicon by again about half a millimeter
that's a big difference that's so in our
testing of the gtx 1060 when we first
put the unit in the system and I if you
may remember I had to put a shim in
there later copper shim that was because
the temperatures were higher than air
cards air-cooled cards in some cases so
that's a big deal they answered every
production unit that shipped with the
CPU cold plate which they mean this by
that has the shaved standoffs so if you
bought one from coarser calm based on
this you're fine that doesn't answer for
MSI Seahawk we don't know when they
caught the unit that the issue in their
production so I don't have an answer if
it's ever affected those but if you do
have a Seahawk that you bought from New
agri amazon that would be from msi not
from corsair my recommendation would be
to install 80 64 or gpu-z and install
some kind of stress test program 3dmark
whatever run it for 20 minutes see what
the kind of max average temperature
ranges and as long as it's reasonable
you're probably fine if it's getting in
the 60s plus Celsius you may want to
contact them and
replacement but corsair is fine based on
this information from them I said how
many users purchased the first
production run and coarser said 85 out
of the first 100 corsair hydro graphics
GTX 1080s went to end users 85 so really
sounds like a non-issue if you're one of
the 85 you should be taken care of by
the shaded standoffs there's really
there's not going to be a temperature
issue there last question was basically
means just saying we saw a thermal
difference between the two it looks like
the protruded plate is better and they
said well we tested that too and they're
sort of saying it's probably more of a
mounting pressure difference than
anything accounting for that extra
degree difference or so so that is
that's what's going on with this really
just to emphasize from the Corsair side
of things this appears to be a non-issue
85 people got the flat cold plate and
those have shaped standoffs so the
thermals are not going to be an issue in
theory you can check them very easily if
you're concerned msi we don't know what
their status is we know that they sold
cards but just again check temperatures
make sure it's good should be though but
if not contact a massage or to let us
know because we can chase them down for
you so that's that's the gist of
everything the primary reason of posting
this video and article is just to let
everyone know our review model may be
different from the one you receive in
the future the temperature should be
mostly the same you will likely based on
our testing not course there's
apparently which is fine there's
different test methodologies based on
our testing if you test the way we do
you'll probably see a slight improvement
in temperature with this one and so that
would mean your real results may look
different than ours did with our review
unit using this one so that's the end of
