unboxings but we got a pretty special
product from AMD this time it is finally
the combination of a Rison cpu and AMD
Vega graphics so I've seen some of the
other unboxings I think we're the only
review outlet to get this version of the
product and of course we'll be doing our
normal in-depth testing on this as soon
as possible but other than that we have
a lot of news to get through today
including specs on well a device similar
to this before that this video is
brought to you by Thermaltake and the
view 71 enclosure the view 71 is a full
tower case that's capable of fitting
three video cards and most
configurations it's also one of the
better cooling cases in our recent case
testing bench lineup the view 71 has
hinged a tempered glass doors on either
side that make it easy to open and show
off and it comes with at least one rain
fan though you can get the RGB version
if you prefer
learn more at the link in the
description below so this is our weekly
hardware news recap video as always of
course the big item here is the AMD
Rison and vega apu for which we have
specs and prices and everything else to
share with you today a little bit odd
that it arrived in a poptart box but i
guess i don't know i guess they're just
trying to bribe us with with puffed
parts at this point other news items
though if you're sick of AMD APU is
because everyone talked about them now
we also have some interesting news on
Newegg killing GPU commission through
their affiliate program intel's pushing
more spectre updates that hopefully are
more promising this time and then some
items about scams which should be pretty
fun like being 90 plus power supplies
and they're better alternative the 95
plus power supplies of course these are
new versions of 80 plus which is an old
and retired standard at this point
because ninety is bigger than 80 and
therefore better will confirm all of the
apu specs and prices and then move on
because that's all that's useful right
now we will have testing on this product
later through back-channel sources but
here's a chart that we made that
contains everything the 2400 g is a 4
core 8 thread single CCX cpu that
operates at 3.6 to 3
gigahertz and contains 11 Vegas II use
equating 704 streaming processors
knowing how many compute units the APU
has we can trivially compute everything
else 11c use means that we end up with
44 texture map units or TM use as each
Cu carries for TM use for perspective
the rx 480 and 580 GPUs contain 144 TM
use we would assume that this puts
performance a bit above the rx 550 which
has 8 CS and maybe a bit below the rx
560 which ranges in Cu count at this
point the GPU clock operates at a boost
of 12 50 megahertz on the 2400 G or 11
100 megahertz on the 2200 G via the rise
in 3 APU for pricing the r5 2400 G
should land at $170 carrying a 4 +0 CCX
configuration and 3.9 gigahertz boost
clock this block diagram shows the Vega
11 core that's in the r5 2400 G the
architecture overall should be familiar
and he is still using its for a CES or
asynchronous compute engines as would be
found in the RX 580 and Vega cards the
two hardware schedulers remain present
as well mark that's HW s these were
introduced in GC n Gen 3 and started
getting more use in Gen 4 the HW s units
can be updated via micro code through
drivers so some level of firmware
patching later on is always possible
with these and these graphic illustrates
a single geometry engine and a draw
stream binning rasterizer
which are accompanied by two pixel
engines there are 11 compute units
present as already shown and there are
64 stream processors per compute unit
which is also standard we reviewed a lot
of ApS in the past we actually did more
ApS than anything else for AMD for a
while because it was during a time when
there basically just refreshes of FX
alongside some new ap use so we've
looked at them plenty of times and kind
of depending on the generation the year
in the price sometimes they're very good
value and sometimes it makes more sense
if you're gaming to buy something like a
GT 1030 or an rx 550 $70 price point
area and then by some $100 ZP to go with
it and you get basically better
performance overall however it might be
different this
time because the Vega GPU architecture
change is significant and the horizon
change is also significant so we have
two very large players in the space that
need to be tested so we'll look at that
separately once it's time to test but
that's kind of the basics of it all
interestingly the materials we've
acquired thus far do explicitly note
that a Windows 10 version 1709 is
required to get the Rison and Vega
portions of the APU to work together
properly and we also noticed that the
APU has gotten rid of the T CTL
temperature offset so that T CTL sensor
that you'd previously seen hardware info
or something where to have a 27 degree
offset for thread Ripper I believe was
the number that's gone now looking at
the temperature should be a lot simpler
it'll just be TDI as far as I understand
it today so that's good news the rest of
it will just have to look at it in
testing but the 2400 G and 2200 G are
the AP is to look at if you're new to
this ap use are just it's a CPU that
contains a more significant graphics
component than you might find on Intel
now APU is AMD's way of saying this is a
CPU with an integrated GPU Intel just
calls it a CPU at this point and then
they might call it an IG PU or something
like that for the integrated graphics so
that's the main news for the APU front
and these ApS tend to be pretty powerful
in the graphics department they do give
a lot more dye space to the GPU
component so it'll be fun to test it but
we are getting that through a side
channel source and then we'll be looking
at it as soon as it comes in which
shouldn't be too long now another thing
here so on the front of CPUs there were
some news a little while back about CPU
mining being potentially profitable and
there are some sensationalist pieces
online about is this the end of CPUs
will they be CPU shortages now the
answer is no no there will not be CPU
shortages because of crypto mining it's
it's great way to get clicks though but
our CP shortage is coming next
they are not you know we the thing with
CPU mining
is one it's not that profitable to if
you use something like a 1950 X or 1920
X go back and look at our room ambient
temperature test four months ago when
difficulty was lower and prices were
higher during that test if I remember
correctly the 1950 X that we had running
for that on kryptonite was doing
something like maybe I don't know I
think it was like 250 today it was
between $2 and $3 a day it's not awful
and you might be able to do more if
you're more skilled with mining or
whatever but the point is you know this
is unless it's doing a lot more money
per day you're looking at a product that
takes like I mean it's like a two foot
squared space to run more motherboards
with CPUs it makes more sense to take
all that money and allocate it into GPUs
if you can get them and run them off of
one motherboard take less area squared
so I there is probably a use case for
CPU mining I'm not arguing that what I
would argue is that no you don't need to
worry about your gaming CPUs going out
of stock and secondly maybe thread
Ripper maybe the high end h EDT Intel
CPUs maybe those get some popularity for
mining okay but your i7s kind of the
$300 category I fives are sevens are
fives I don't think there are going to
be warehouses in China filled with
motherboards that are doing CPU mining
I'm not an expert there that's opinion
however I am fairly confident that we're
not going to see like the end of the
world of PC gaming because of
cryptocurrency GPU is kind of a special
case memory it seems like it's it's all
happening at once it seems like the
prices for everything are going crazy at
the same time I can see how you might
think that would spread to other
components but you have to remember
memory prices are high GPU prices are
high what do those things have in common
ddr4 and GPU memory come out of the same
three factories so of course if prices
are high for one of them because of a
memory supply shortage or high demand or
whatever then they're going to be high
for the other one they feed off of each
other CPUs are in a different category
they don't come out of
Samson and hynek's they're made either
by Intel or by and these foundries that
they outsource Global Foundries
typically so I really don't think we're
gonna have a CPA shortage I would be
happy to come on record saying that so
I'm fairly confident that the only
shortages we're going to have our other
components that are memory related right
now but we'll see maybe I'll be wrong
maybe some crazy mining algorithm will
come out for CPUs and then we'll have a
problem if that happens tweet at me and
say hey Steve this thing just came out
could you look at it and we'll do some
testing and look at it
new egg today revoked its affiliate
Commission for video cards which the
companies that sub affiliate networks
declare to be changed pursuant to quote
bitcoins unexpected popularity so what
they really mean here of course is
cryptocurrency Bitcoin zhun my Nobel on
GPUs I granted a lot of mining if you're
going through nice hash or whatever it
is going to be paid out in Bitcoin but
you're not mining Bitcoin so whatever
its semantics at this point so either
way the affiliate network thing I'm sure
many of you are aware of this basically
content creators or anyone really you
could get an Amazon or Newegg affiliate
account if you link people you know to a
product and they buy it then you get a
percent Commission and it's not
increasing the cost that the customer
pays for the products it's coming out of
a separate budget that's set aside by
Amazon in one case or by Newegg and
going to the person who linked the
product so that program has been around
forever it's a good way for retailers to
fight each other for basically I'll use
their word influencer attention where
are you driving the sales and Newegg is
changing and house GPUs video cards will
no longer be included now there's kind
of two sides to this this is less of a
mining thing that depending it on
cryptocurrency which is an awfully nice
scapegoat and there is certainly a
higher demand because of cryptocurrency
but we've talked about this a lot now we
spoke with all the video card
manufacturers memory has every bit to do
with this as cryptocurrency it's it's
difficult to get supply for memory
period if your manufacturer and the
price has gone up twenty to thirty
dollars bill of materials cost for your
video cards so
there's gonna be some of the vendors
have now officially increased their MSRP
by twenty to thirty dollars
see the last news video from last week
so there is more to it than just kryptos
that is a nice way to make it easy and
pin it on people that that everyone
everyone kind of rally against the
common enemy but yeah so this we think
is more likely the contributor to new ID
clean its GP affiliate Commission is the
memory cost now there's two sides to
this because if new egg is keeping the
same prices and killing its Commission
for that product that's great that means
they are helping consumers I'm all for
that I don't need that Commission if it
means that GPUs can be a bit more
affordable that's fine
and I think a lot of content creators
would agree if they are increasing the
price and killing Commission which we'll
see if that happens they've got a couple
of days here then then it's just trying
to make more money off of something that
already is being gouged like crazy
because demand is high and whatever so
we'll see but anyway content creators
may be interested in that new egg is no
longer giving Commission for video cards
but Amazon still does BH photo does and
plenty of other sites smaller ones
bestbuy.com still does so yeah you may
see more links like that from content
creators we tend to stick with new I can
amazon because just they're easier to
use anyway but interesting news so next
one Intel pushes more Spectre updates
this is following on a lot of spectrum
meltdown updates we've covered lately
and also finally beyond the process of
shipping more stable microcode they had
some kind of interesting wording and
their press release where they basically
said they of course will continue to
encourage people to keep their operating
systems up to date and everything else
up to date but I mean the the opposing
side there is that if you did that
previously then you could have had
reboot issues on Intel CPUs because of
their flawed micro code updates so a bit
of both sides in the days following the
Google project zero announcement Intel
scrambled to release its software patch
and there was at widespread concern over
possible performance hits this was
followed by reports of BIOS updates with
poor implementation of Intel's patch
causing random
reboots on as well and Broadwell CPUs
and then apparently some other platforms
as well until reported that they found
the root cause of this issue On January
22nd and they even requested that
manufacturers halt the distribution of
the affected BIOS updates they've been
working on solving the issue since then
and today until reported that they are
in the midst of distributing fixed
patches to OEMs they also mentioned that
they are continuing to beta test their
updates with OEMs and partners before
moving them to production so hopefully
there's not a repeat of the previous
round
although the continued to quote could be
read as saying that it was the OEMs who
didn't do enough testing last time of
course it's really on Intel the second
part of the news post is a plea to users
to keep their systems up-to-date which
is again a bit rich coming only a week
after the bugged update but still good
advice this is just kind of a fun news
item this is on some I guess scams you
could call them 90 plus power supplies
so high wattage power supplies targeting
cryptocurrency miners are being
advertised with knockoff 80 plus
certifications and if you search for
Bitcoin power supply on eBay or
especially on Aliexpress you will find
dozens of power supplies that have been
branded as 90 plus or 95 plus gold for
example 80 plus is the name of the
actual organization that's has the
certification and there's no such thing
as 90 plus if a power supply were in
fact 90% plus efficient it would still
be under the 80 plus brand but it would
be awarded something like 80 plus
platinum or titanium not gold and many
of the power supplies are also stamped
with the Bitcoin symbol varies a bit
down where they stole the art from and
despite GPU mining Bitcoin at home being
sort of a thing of the past they're
still branding it that way another fun
one this one isn't a 90 plus or 95 plus
certification I guess but it's kind of a
strange power supply it's a 34 50 watt
single plug power supply good luck
finding an outlet that will allow you to
pull that kind of power in the US and is
a monstrosity it's clearly 280x power
slides that are just side by side in the
same casing and it's it's got the
prominent Bitcoin symbols on each fan as
well so I don't think we're gonna buy
this and test it because I do in fact
need this place to not burn down but
some fun stuff out there on Aliexpress
if you just search for a Bitcoin Barrow
supplies you have ten minutes to kill go
do it I guess next one hard drive
failure rates for 2017 so Backblaze is a
backup service data backup and recovery
and they release annual updates on their
drives that they've used for the last
year and their drive failures for the
last year and then they categorize it by
these specific skews and the vendors the
most impressive numbers for this report
were for HGST and hitachi for terabyte
drives which had less than one percent
failure rates in 2015 2016 and 2017
failures were relatively high with some
Seagate drives and 1/4 terabyte model in
particular failed at a rate of about 3%
annually backways has replaced 6800
failed drives since they began logging
in 2013 and 1500 eight of those were in
2017 overall against all of its drives
the company is logging about a two
percent failure rate looking at the last
year of data that they published which
isn't awful if they're really getting
hammered all the time but yeah HGST has
looked good for the last couple years
and they continue to do so today and
then back to paralyze for a moment FSP
has a $700 liquid-cooled power supply
now I think that we're gonna bits power
on this one and this is the FSP hydro
PTM plus it's a 1200 watt / 1400 watt
power supply and will be available for
purchase soon this apply is outfitted
with aura sink compatible RGB LEDs and
of course a liquid cooling block
naturally what else do you want on a
power supply it's rated 80 plus
efficient at 1200 Watts cooled by the
built-in fan but the liquid cooling
version theoretically raises the limit
to 1,400 watts
the price tag $700 several times what to
high-quality 700 watt power supplies
would cost were roughly equivalent to
what two air-cooled 1200 watt 80-plus
Platinum power supplies would cost the
first 500 buyers
will also receive what they're calling
quote an AI Oh pump radiator and fan
assembly from bits power and sleeves
cables
it's open-loop so it's not really a IO
and the same sense as a CLC but whether
any Ora sink using PC Gamer draws 1200
watts plus for long enough to make it
necessary under continuous loads that's
another question then finally there were
a couple of hardware sales to point out
for the last couple days and they're
going on for a bit in monitor land
there's the Acer XG 270 hu 27 inch panel
one millisecond gray to gray 144 Hertz
1440p and freesync that's currently $400
the Red River 1950 X is still at 900
which is versus $1000 at launch pretty
good but it does seem like it's more of
a permanent price at this point and the
r7 1700 as well seems to be more
permanent at around 290 to 300 these
days the i5 8600 K has a $15.00 promo
code and that's really mostly good and
good ones that we saw for the last
couple days so as always links to
