hardware news recap we have some
follow-ups on CTS labs for this week as
well as Intel meltdown inspector patch
performance updates a 2600 x AMD rise in
2003 cpu that's been listed on Amazon
accidentally and some other information
on asrock being a GPU vendor asus and
the rog x4 70 motherboard samsung power
outages killing 30% of thief flash
supply for the month things like that
before that this video is brought to you
by EVGA and the X 299 dark motherboard
for the Intel high-end desktop CPUs the
X 299 dark is one of the only
motherboards on the market with proper
vrm cooling we've tested this and found
a significant performance increase over
those without active cooling on the
prm's
this board was used in our recent
attempt to set a top 10 record in fire
strike and you can learn more about the
x-29 dark at the link in the description
below we're a brief update on cts labs
and their security research which
alleged severe flaws in the AMD zen
architecture if you're not up to speed
on this story we have a video on it on
the channel already but to recap it
briefly cts labs is a new security
company that put out some content that
said these are a bunch of security
vulnerabilities we believe we've found
in the sound architecture and they gave
Andy about 24 hours notice they gave
some journalists as we understand its
earlier notice and also there was
another company Viceroy research that
put out a 30 page insane tirade like the
ramblings of a lunatic if you see our
first video that really drew a lot of
criticism for all of this so as we said
in the original content the exploits
appear to be rooted in legitimacy
however the presentation of those
exploits we think as an opinion is
highly unprofessional
so either way we needed to dig more into
it we sent a bunch of questions over to
their PR company which did finally
respond by the way and some of those
questions were not really answered there
kind of skirted around but one of the
questions that we can we can kind of put
up the whole list of questions on the
screen if you want to see it and you
just pause and read them but one of the
questions was about nine wells capital
with which CTS labs CFO yaran luke
Silberman has held a position in the
past we asked what the relationship was
between nine wells capital which is a
hedge fund firm and CTS labs and the
company provided this statement quote
nine well is a lawn oriented financial
partnership that was managed by our CFO
he no longer actively manages that
partnership nine Wells has no financial
position in AMD Intel or any other
semiconductor company and that's a start
we still need some clarity on this
because some really simple digging
reveals an SEC filing recently that
lists here in Luke Silverman as the
president of nine Wells capital as
recently as March 8 2018 so perhaps that
document is outdated or we're missing
something but we need some clarity on
that point because right now we're a bit
confused on how those two things can be
simultaneously true we can't make any
links right now but we've asked for that
clarity Luke Silberman was also listed
on the CTS labs website as the managing
director of nine Wells Capital very
recently too so not really sure what to
make of that regarding Viceroy we asked
this question what is cts Labs
affiliation with Viceroy Research did
Viceroy Commission CTS labs for this
report and have the two companies had
any previous connections or affiliation
the last part being the most important
and thus ignored the response was as
follows Viceroy is not a client of CTS
we did not send Viceroy our report for
any additional questions please ask
Viceroy so unfortunately the side steps
a lot of those questions like the
question about the affiliation between
the two companies there's some kind of
there's so here's the story Viceroy
research the president of it said in a
an interview with Reuters I believe that
they received a leak of the CTS labs
document or a tip of the document
prior to the documents publication this
is how Viceroy research had a 30-page
tirade available within hours of the CTS
labs report going public because
otherwise just physically impossible to
do so the question that I have that is
still not answered is what connection is
there between the two companies because
CTS Labs is a small new company and
somehow there's a leak that goes out to
viceroy research and yet they claim they
did not send viceroy their report so
perhaps that's true and will certainly
allow for that to be true until there's
evidence otherwise either way though
that's kind of what we have for now our
most important questions were
unfortunately avoided or ignored or not
addressed plainly right now we've
followed up again but some of those
included for example they'll back to
Viceroy briefly Viceroy after they got
that document by the way so they stated
on record that they took a sizable short
position on handi so a little bit weird
but anyway we also asked the following
does CTS Labs or do any of its employees
currently hold the position on Andy in
the stock market we later followed up
and said currently or in the past couple
of weeks
CTS Labs did not respond to this
question and further Ian Contras of an
attack and David Cantor of real-world
tech with whom we've worked previously
recently asked CTS Labs a series of
questions on a phone call
including what their affiliation is with
Viceroy research and CTS labs
immediately concluded the call upon that
question being asked given the avoidance
of answering our hardest questions and
skirting answers to a few that were sort
of addressed we remain skeptical of the
motives of CTS labs or in the very least
of the professionalism of what they're
trying to achieve because it is possible
that there is no link here it is
possible that there's no financial
motive there is no evidence to suggest a
hard motive outside of a lot of big red
flags but nothing that is concrete
evidence
so we
we'll allow for the possibility that CTS
labs is attempting to publish security
findings that they believe are in good
faith
however the professionalism and the mode
of publishing that data is suspect or in
the very least unprofessional and here's
another thing in that an attack call
which is it's like 30,000 words it's
published on their website a lot of CTS
labs defenses and defenses to other
media were that we're new we don't
really know what we're doing this is the
first time you publish something and
basically asking for slack but the
entire company background page and all
the management profiles brag about how
these people have ten plus years of
experience in security research each so
they've made some pretty big mistakes
for a new company that claims to have
jointly many at least a couple of
decades of experience while still
somehow simultaneously being new to the
industry so that's quite some dichotomy
there but that's the update we don't
really have much it's possible that
there's no link to possible there's no
financial motive that doesn't change the
fact that this all looks very strange
anyway next one is on Andy in the r5
2,600 X so this was listed accidentally
on Amazon not much to say here other
than listing on Amazon Germany
accidentally revealed the price and the
release date of the AMD r5 2600 X the
processor was priced at 250 euro with
tax just over three hundred US dollars
but pricing is different in different
regions and it was scheduled to become
available for purchase on April 19th
which it seems accurate will say some
extremely basic specs were also revealed
on the product page including frequency
base as 3.6 gigahertz and boost at 4.25
gigahertz not sure if that's what XF are
are acts of far too but X of r2 pushes
it a bit further if so or if not and
it's based on 12 nanometer process so
that's all we have for that one next one
Intel meltdown inspector patch
performance updates also in the news
this is about a week or two prior to the
CTS lab store
taking over the news cycle we had a call
with Intel a briefing on their own
meltdown inspector updates we've been
following this for a while one of their
earlier micro code updates resulted in
unexpected reboots and shutdowns on some
platforms so those were all fixed
recently now there's an update that
applies that these security updates a
path across the past five years of Intel
CPUs I believe it's 100 percent of them
in the last five years that have been
made these pertain to meltdown inspector
and should harden security without
sacrificing too much performance on the
front of performance our understanding
right now from some research is that it
looks at from talking with Intel is that
it looks like CPUs that are made within
the last couple of generations eighth
seventh and sixth generation some fifth
although that's not that popular should
have the lowest performance impact from
these micro code updates often in single
digit percentages depending on how and
what you're measuring the older
generation systems will experience
heavier performance impact this is
particularly true with responsiveness in
cysmart testing and further older
systems with an SSD will have more
significant performance loss than older
systems with a hard drive because your
bottlenecks change so as far as numbers
what we've been given from Intel and we
have not yet independently validated so
keep that in mind we'll look at it
eventually hopefully but what we've been
given for now is sis mark measurements
that show on average 6th 7th and 8th gen
performance loss decay in between or
retaining 88% of the maximum performance
pre patch so you've got a bit of a drop
there 12 percentage points off of
baseline 100 or as low as 76% of
baseline 100% in responsiveness which is
a metric provided by sis mark and older
systems again with SSDs have bigger hits
than than the newer stuff but for gain
performance it looks like the newest
micro code update shouldn't really have
an impact on gaming this coincides with
what we found previously for Microsoft's
own Windows updates and will
kans all this more once there are a
couple more patches but they're still
pushing stuff so we're just kind of
waiting for a good point when
everything's stable and it's not getting
updated every week next one is on
Nvidia's real time rate rates and
announcements that they're making at GDC
Game Developers Conference not to be
confused with GTC the week following
nvidia has been talking about real time
ray tracing for a long time now in fact
I remember covering a story from an
videos Tony Tomasi who actually also
presented this one in I don't know many
years ago and he predicted that by 2015
we would have real time ray tracing in
games so not too far off the mark but
and vidi has been talking about it a
while and they have another announcement
on the advancement of real time ray
tracing the company has announced its
new Nvidia RT X it's called at GDC which
is a ray tracing technology option for
game engines RT x was demonstrated as
running on Volta architecture GPUs and
integrates primarily with a new
Microsoft DirectX 12 ray tracing API
alternatively or in addition to this RT
X can be accessed via game works
libraries for developers who opted in an
Nvidia announced that for a games
epic games remedy entertainment and
unity the engine maker have already
begun working with RT X a new game works
SDK is also upcoming and that adds
support for Volta architectures and may
be more interesting to you all quote
future generation GPU architectures and
will enable ray-traced area shadows
raytrace glossy reflections and rage
race ambient occlusion these are all as
we understand it basically what they
sound like ray traced area shadows
should be shadows that are generated
based on ray tracing and so forth so
that's that's brief overview we'll look
into this more as software comes out
that we have to actually test and play
around with but that's their news Asus
has an AR o GX 470 board that was leaked
I believe via video cards so a picture
of the asus rog x4 70 - eff Strix
motherboard was sent anonymously - video
cards comm techpowerup translates the
Chinese care
between the CPU socket and the memory
slots as players indicating that it's a
gaming motherboard if the vrm heatsink
and i/o cover didn't already tip you off
and no explanation was offered for the
word hybrid or the other characters on
the board that's all we really know now
it's one of these six known a CSX 470
boards the other isn't listed by video
cards are the prime export Sony Pro the
ROG Strix x4 70 I gaming and the
crosshair 7 hero following up the
crosshair 6 hero along with a tough
export Sony Plus gaming this one's also
really quick as ROC has confirmed
officially that they will be making GPUs
or rather video cards and those video
cards will be using AMD GPUs exclusively
for now that's really a whole I know
they put out a teaser trailer they
showed a dual axial card with an 8 pin
power header perspex that's all we have
they used words like unpredictable and
mysterious which are of course two
attributes you want in your video card
but that's all we know so as rocks
getting into GPUs with AMD the brand
will be called phantom gaming and we'll
keep an eye on it but nothing concrete
yet other than a firm confirmation from
asrock that this is indeed happening
next one is Samsung's power outage that
killed flash supply Samsung's a massive
peon take fab which we mentioned in
hardware news a couple weeks ago in the
context of a second fab opening
experienced a 30 minute power outage on
March 9th reports have since come out
stating that 60,000 waivers were damaged
due to the outage which translates to
3.5% of global and wafer production
according to Tom's Hardware we've been
keeping track of Nan prices on dram
exchange but they don't appear to have
been affected yet anyway Logitech G has
announced a new g5 60 gaming speaker and
g5 13 mechanical keyboard both with the
Logitech G light sync feature to
synchronize RGB LEDs to gameplay
Logitech says that both are intended to
complement the popular g502 Mouse we're
most interested in the g5 13 keyboard
which will offer a choice of Roemer G
tactile and rubber G linear switches the
linear switches are new and should be
similar to Cherry
while the tactile ones that have been
out a while are similar to damped Browns
if you were to put a rubber o-ring on
them
unlike the cherry switches that Logitech
and others used typically Romer G's are
designed to not let light spill out the
sides of the stems and other than that
according to Logitech the switches
actuate up to 25% faster than the
leading competitors so they say at a
distance of 1.5 millimeters combined
with a low force 45 gram actuation as
for the speakers those have lighting
zones so you can use software to
interact with RGB LEDs so that the
speakers light in different areas based
on what is being shown on screen it's
part of an ambient lighting initiative
that should be theoretically a bit
cheaper the products MSRP $200 for the
speakers $150 for the keyboard the
speakers are two speakers and a
subwoofer also an audio news SteelSeries
seems to be trying out a new line of
flagship gaming headsets in the new
arctic pro series the new headsets are
largely similar to one another in
aesthetics and use what they call
premium it flourishes like steel and
aluminum but deviates slightly in
configuration in total the new lineup is
comprised of three models the arctas pro
the arctas pro and game DAC and the
arctas pro wireless the arcanist pro
sits at the bottom run and is your
classic PC headset and then it goes up
from there pricing is a hundred and
eighty dollars to the pro 250 for the
pro with DAC and 330 for the pro
Wireless and then finally Corsair
appears to be continuing its revival of
one of their most popular case series
after the recent launch of the 500d
obsidian case of course there's a newest
member appears to be the obsidian 1000d
ostensibly a successor to the 900 d the
new monolithic case will be a super
tower capable of housing 2 separately
derived systems
leaked specs include support for two 480
millimeter radiators one 420 radiator
one 240 radiator 8 120 millimeter fans
in the front two 120 or 140 millimeter
fans in the rear and 3 140 s in the top
with six two and a half pays five three
and a half bays and an integrated
commander pro lighting system the
styling of the case employs aluminum
steel and curves a tempered glass on
hinges much like the new 500 d the
alleged price on this one
hundred dollars but this is of course
still elique so things could change
that's it for this week has always

patreon.com/scishow stop that directly
we're going to store it on cameras an
access net to pick up one of our mod
mats like this one which we'll be
