revisit older architecture cards ideally
two generations back this is the gtx 770
and today we are sort of reviewing it
we're rebadging it to look at how it
compares against modern cards because
it's about the upgrade cycle for owners
of the gtx 770 it's been out three years
now came out in May of 2013 so it's
about time for folks to be looking
around for upgrades though it does still
do pretty ok in most games before
getting to the benchmarks this coverage
is brought to you by an tech and their
new cube mini ITX case designed by Razer
and equipped with tinted acrylic windows
on most the sides if you want to learn
more about the box hit the link of the
description below recapping the gtx 770
for those who don't quite remember all
the specs this card operates on kepler
architecture which preceded Nvidia's
maxwell and current pascal GPU
architectures at the time and these most
direct competition was the 200 series
and that included the r9 280 and r9 280x
cards the gtx 770 shipped in two
gigabyte and later four gigabyte
quantities with reference using two
gigabytes of memory and that's what we
have here the gtx 770 host 1536 cuda
cores with a base clock of 1046
megahertz and boost of 1085 but there
are a few important things to note here
first of all a chord is not necessarily
equal a core between architecture is
going from kepler to maxwell you could
see some generational improvements in
the core architecture where even upwards
of 40% there was a performance per watt
gain and that maintains with the pascal
architecture andy does it with polaris
over their previous architectures so
cores do not necessarily and generally
almost never scale linearly from one
generation to the next because just the
block diagram layout alone if you look
at that you can see a good number of
differences one architecture to the next
so don't look at this 1536 CUDA cores
and just immediately compare it to
something like a 1060 with 1280 CUDA
cores and assume a 770 will therefore be
better because that's not quite how it
works
clock rate also is not quite as simple
as well the last generation or two
generations ago at this point was a
thousand megahertz so now they're almost
two thousand megahertz
that doesn't mean there's a 2x gain and
performance either necessarily that we
see that in some cases but the clock
rate alone does have a lot of variables
especially with Nvidia with boost 3.0 so
just some disclaimers to make notes it's
better to just go off of the actual test
data than to go off of speculation for
architectural changes or focusing solely
on FPS testing for today we also only
have this gtx 770 - gigabyte reference
unit so your overclocked models may vary
in performance if you've got some of
those it's still a strong baseline for
performance though and will give you at
least an idea of where your 770 performs
and you can probably extrapolate from
there test methodology and more in-depth
information as always to be found in the
article link to the description below if
you're curious about how we tested
anything or why or what drivers we used
we're starting with Battlefield 1 which
again testing methodology is defined
pretty heavily in our bf1 GPU review and
benchmarks and that's posted on the
website looking at 1080p ultra
performance with DirectX 11 we're
ignoring DX 12 for now for this card the
GTX 770 is capable of outputting 43 FPS
average with lows around 37 and 35 fps
that lands the card just below believe
it or not with the GTX 1050 a $110 card
is capable of and about the same as what
the rx 460 does is another card that
this one specifically because 4 gigabyte
model is around 120 $130 but still not
that expensive of a card if this sounds
too low keep in mind that the
generational changes also mean waning
driver support and optimizations for
older hardware and that's important the
drivers used to do have optimized the
battlefield 1 performance for Kepler but
the 770 with 2 gigabytes of vram is
still well below the gtx 1050 TI and is
approximately three times lower than the
gtx 1070 considering the 770 was
originally $400 at launch the gtx 1070
would be both the namesake replacement
and the accurate price point replacement
for the 770 also about a $400 card and
such an upgrade it moves performance
from below 50 FPS to above 120 fps
average at 1080p with this 1070
sustaining it lows well above 60fps even
just upgrading to an rx 470 would be
worthwhile in some ways anyway and at an
affordable price but a 200 dollar
investment in a GTX 1060 or our X 480
would yield better frame rate for the
1064 example you'd be nearing 100 FPS at
1080p if you're upgrading your GPU but
keeping the current monitor one of these
devices 470 480 or 1060 would make a lot
of sense because a 1440p monitor upgrade
in step with the GPU would match better
with a gtx 1070 upgrade with doom at
1080p and using OpenGL we're seeing the
GTX 770 output a frame rate of about 44
FPS average with 0.1% lows that dip near
in 20 fps this places the card right
around the gtx 950 and RX 460 both
low-end devices that almost feel like
they should totally worse from the 770
even though we've seen that twice that
they're not necessarily worse the GTX
1050 Ti meanwhile operates at around 72
FPS average with the GTX 1060 gaming X
at 101 three average when we switch over
to Vulcan performance still has the 770
around 40 FPS average easily
outperformed by nearly every other card
in the stack looking at black ops 3 with
the memory limitations disabled we're
posting an average FPS of 66 at 1080p
with high settings the 165 dollar msi
gtx 1050 TI gaming ex meanwhile is
operating at 78 FPS average with the
lows closer to 60fps the 380 ex
outperforms the 770 pretty reasonably
but this is a title which tends to show
Andy more favor than in some other games
the GTX 1060 provides a 2x performance
gain over the 770 the 1070 provides
nearly a 3x performance gain and the AR
X 480 gaming X also post performance
about double what the GTX 770 can output
if we look at older games like Metro
last light we see the GTX 770 is able to
keep up better with the 1050 1050 Ti and
r9 380 X we think this demonstrates well
the difference is that driver support
can make since newer games will get
their most immediate and higher
prioritized driver development focused
on the flagship architectures from each
vendor Metro hasn't needed updates for
some time now it's stable and pretty old
and that makes it stagnant in both game
and driver updates the GTX 770 does
pretty well here relative
it's performance elsewhere 1070
outperforms the 770 by about 2x so not
quite as Extreme as the last charts with
a 1080 beginning to cap out against the
performance ceiling with the CPU GTA 5
is a hard-hitting title that released
last year and so had a good mix of
support for Kepler and 200 series cards
at launch the GTX 770 is able to drive
62 FPS average with very high and ultra
graphics effectively maxed other than
the advanced graphics tab which is left
all disabled and that is flanked by the
r9 380 X and GTX 10:50 cards the 1050 Ti
keeps its trend of at least slightly
outpacing the 770 in this case that's by
about 4 to 5 FPS average and the RX 470
is also keeping its trend in this case
it's 15 FPS ahead or a 24% change the RX
488 gigabyte card operates at 85 FPS
average or 37.5% change with the gtx
1070 offering nearly a 2x gain in
performance still though the 770 is what
you'd consider playable at for GTA 5 at
these settings check the link in the
description below for more Mirror's Edge
catalyst benchmarks and some other
information for the most part the GTX
770 is still pretty capable of playing
modern games you just have to reduce the
quality settings and if that's not
desirable then upgrades do obviously
make sense this is a good time to
upgrade because one there's been a major
architectural shift just in the
fabrication process alone and generally
we do tend to recommend skipping one
generation so in this case that would be
the 9 series or the 970 right here and
go into something else we're either 1070
or somewhere else in the stack that I'll
talk about in a moment
so this is a good time to do that if you
do prefer keeping those higher graphics
settings but battlefield 1 you can still
play it you just really do have to tank
the quality of it the most linear step
would be the gtx 1070 which offers
anywhere from a 2 to 3x performance gain
depending on the games tested this jump
would also allow you to upgrade to a
1440p monitor or greater and would
almost really encourage it if trying to
keep a 1080p monitor set up to stretch
out investment a bit longer in your
display find something like an Rx 480 or
GTX 1060 would make the most sense as a
mid costed option and you can check out
views on different aiv partner models of
those cards if you want to learn more
the arts 470 does post reasonable
performance gains over the 770 upwards
of 24 percent in some titles you can get
them for around 170 hundred eighty
dollars now but it just doesn't quite
feel worth the upgrade when considering
the relative performance jump so
something like an Rx 480 or gtx 960
model if you've had this card for three
years already you're stretching your
investment out pretty well as is so as
I've said in the last few reviews of the
earlier architecture releases for Pascal
and Polaris the AR X 480 we talked about
this the 470 talked about it and then
the gtx 1070 1080 and 1060 the thing is
the industry looks like it's pretty much
ready for 1440p gaming at this point on
all those devices certainly and it's
really not often that we talk about
upgrading a video card in step with the
monitor because in the past it's at
least the last few years you've pretty
much had a step from one 1080p display
with one video card to the same 1080p
display probably with a new video card
because it just hasn't been a reason to
step up performance hasn't been there
maxwell began changing that a bit and
some of the hawaii cards but now it
looks like 1440p is properly really
playable on all these devices that are
modern that includes the arts 480 not
shown on the table but we've talked
about that in those reviews so that's
the sort of interesting part here is if
you are upgrading from something like a
770 to something a bit higher end in the
stack which again a 1070 would be your
most linear step I would not recommend
the founder's edition model by the way
we've talked about that in the past
though but a heavy partner models are
are a bit more price favorable but if
you're doing a linear step like that
really for the most part you are pushing
frame rates that will support the 1440p
displays unless you really really want
120 144 Hertz gaming in which case
you're still going to be on 1080p so
things to think about but overall that
770 is holding up decently but a bit
better than the older titles where
driver optimizations not really creating
the class disparity we're seeing it with
something like battlefield one in the
meantime hopefully that provides a look
at two generation old performance we'll
be doing more of these in the future for
other cards that are not the 770 hit the
