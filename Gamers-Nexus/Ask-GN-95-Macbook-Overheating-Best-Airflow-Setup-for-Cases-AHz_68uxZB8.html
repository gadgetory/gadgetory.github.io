we're shooting three today this is the
third one I've shot don't know the order
they'll go up one is on the patreon site
so you got a patreon.com slash gamers
nexus to get access to the bonus
episodes available to all backers and
then we have some behind the scenes
stuff from the office available to $5
plus so this episode we're talking out
briefly he's flaking midnight the cats
who have been featured on the channel
also been talking about MacBook Pro and
thermals pretty fun topic that I wanted
to bring up because we never talked
about Mac and someone asked about it and
I thought that's a great opportunity to
talk about something Apple's done that's
kind of sad so yeah great topics for
this week leave your questions in the
comment section below we're working
pretty hard to bring on more experts so
as you ask questions if you think
there's a really good one that I might
not be able to tackle so if you don't
think I can do it that's fine post it
anyway and I will try to find someone
who's available to answer it either just
in email or is able to join me and we'll
be doing that more going forward as we
move into the office two before that
this video is brought to you by NZXT is
new h 500 case which we recently found
to have an impressively effective
cooling setup that is entirely negative
pressure when stock the H 500 is the
successor of the s 340 and s 340 a lead
offering high build quality that's all
steel and glass and kael management
features that are also a top class for
the $70 compact mid tower case H 500 is
a part of NZXT Zanu H series lineup
which also features options from mini
ITX micro ATX and full ATX builds learn
more at the link in the description
below alright so first note as always
mod mats are available now they're
shipping out as the orders come in not
quite sold out yet we're trying to get
another order in but it looks like we're
gonna sell out before they come in so if
you want one pick it up on store that
game is next to stock that we have the
chalkboard design shirts there are two
it's just a black version of the blue
print shirt and we have our video card
Anatomy poster which has BRM component
stuff like that let's go to the first
question first one is from supa who said
actually it's really from everyone it's
from the community because as we posted
the movie into vlog videos I've probably
answered like 5 to 10 times each this
question and it's well snowflake in
midnight May
to move to the office if not can we get
some b-roll footage from time to time I
don't want to have to threaten I'm
subbing but if necessary and I don't
blame you
so here's the plant I don't know if
we've talked about this publicly I think
I did and one of the patreon
behind-the-scenes things not meant to be
a plug but we're getting obviously a
bunch of new furniture part of that's
gonna be a new set furniture and so this
is actually like beyond the cat
questions interesting I think hopefully
for some of you this table I think is
gonna stay here the the famous wobbly
table so I think we're gonna leave this
here and I think I leave the wood wall
here I I kind of want to bring it for
because it's cool to have the background
for history but I like the idea of
keeping these two things here so if at
the end of the day I'm like you know
what I want to do a livestream from home
I want to go home set up the camera on a
tripod and build the computer and just
hang out with everyone I'll be able to
do that I'll have a wall I'll have a
table and I'll get some extra lights
just some cheap ones to make it possible
and so part of that is is we've already
I mean I thought of the snowflake thing
long before we even signed a contract on
anything and part of that is she'll be
able to still be in b-roll shots and
maybe even a role if I shoot anything
from home like just a live stream or
whatever so do not fear they will still
make appearances I am specifically
arranging for that seems a little silly
but but we are so anyway the other the
bigger thing here there well maybe not
depends on who may be the secondary
things many of you is that we're gonna
have just an extra spot for filming so
it wouldn't be a manned camera I don't
think for those it'd just be like
something that I want to do and maybe we
stream to the main channel who gets the
side channel I don't know anyway yeah
they'll still be there still be in the
shots next question is from animation
creations 42 who says with the recent
drama regarding the MacBook Pro thermals
do you think Apple would have been able
to get the same performance as the I 9
with better thermals with an AMD mobile
CPU if they made a higher-end
mobile chips as AMD CPUs tend to be more
efficient than Intel's
this is a really complicated question
for a lot of reasons I am going to
address different parts of this and
slightly modify it so
without being specific on anthea mobile
CPUs because I honestly don't know much
about them I don't know really much
about anything that goes in like laptops
or phones that isn't also a desktop part
we're very closely related to Wan and I
haven't tested anything and the mobile
CPU so let me change your question a
little bit please to remove some of the
specificity on that what I will say is
that yes if your question absolutely the
answer is yes it is possible to achieve
the same performance as a high on part
with a low on part if the high on part
is throttling into a point of being
garbage so the answer is yes and I don't
know specifically about the mobile CPUs
or what their specs are anything really
but I do know that if you have a part
that can't perform to spec then a lower
end part that can perform respect might
be better so yes definitely and that's
part of the problem I think people had
with this initial MacBook stuff was that
if it's throttling to a point of just
you could have spent less money on a
lower end part and got the same
performance you kind of feel ripped off
but also Apple does at least partially
specialize in that particular attribute
ripping people off whether it's repair
shops or individuals so I'm not saying
they don't I don't I'm not gonna I'll
leave that there that's that's fine
I'm fine with what I said I thought
about doing a wishy-washy thing giving
myself an out in case people wanted to
argue it but you know what I don't care
they am NOT a fan of Apple so and that's
fine we don't review their stuff so that
particular subset is not a consideration
any of our reviews I don't think we've
never reviewed an Apple part and
probably will stay that way unless it's
something like this except I don't want
to buy a MacBook right now anyway as far
as the rest of this so I will give a
shout to snazzy labs who has a good
video of taking apart his MacBook Pro I
used that to get a better understanding
what was in there cuz I'm not gonna buy
one and he actually referenced our house
Evo coolers work video so consider this
assembiy I had some symbiotic
relationship so from his video there's
absolutely zero surface area on the
cooler and/or on the heatsink I should
say it's got just one fat pipe and it's
got some very very very
any fins so it's not an impressive
cooler this is part of like all laptop
it's not just Apple it's part of this
like sort of sometimes stupid craze to
get just half a millimeter smaller than
the next one so that you can make it
look like you changed something this
generation which is I find particularly
annoying because I don't know I I'd
rather my laptop's be a millimeter
taller and have rj45 than not but you
know different different audiences
different people so anyway that what I
saw in that video I saw basically zero
vrm cooling at all I saw very little
surface area on the heatsink the fans
aren't particularly good and you end up
with Apple's response which is quote
we've identified that there is a missing
digital key in the firmware that impacts
the thermal management system and could
drive clock speeds down under heavy
thermal loads on the new MacBook Pro
they told this to see net
they also said a bug fixes included in
today's Mac OS High Sierra 10 13 6
supplemental update and is recommended
what I understand this kind of fix a lot
of the problems but I am going to say I
don't fully buy the explanation here I
think the digital key and missing in
firmware that impacts their own
management system is code for we were
running the voltage to I and we down
down volted the processor I think that's
what it comes down to and or they just
under bolted it either way I don't know
I do not have one I can't validate it
but I would imagine under Bolton might
have played a role I haven't looked into
it that could be wrong well I mean I
have looked into it as much as I could
but regardless of what Apple claims the
problem was it's still a garbage cooling
solution there's still nothing on the
vrm components really of note and I'm
not impressed by by what they built for
something as expensive as it is so yeah
it's you are correct a in any scenario
ever Apple or not a cheaper CPU that
actually performs versus a sudden 980 XE
that's down clock into 800 megahertz the
cheaper one will be better
so yeah
it's really all there is to it but
anyway I kind of wanted to buy one just
to just do some testing but with the MU
the office move and everything I decided
we'll just we'll shout this one for now
and let the others tackle it anyway very
unimpressed with their cooling solution
regardless of what their software
changes do you cannot fix a poor design
with software and it remains a poor
design whether or not the software works
around the problem so Anna next one Ross
who include Sinskey says what's the
limiting factor on CPU air cooler
effectiveness fan speed CFM air moving
through the fans to the fins tower size
etc well the first one with any kind of
ambient cooler any kind of air cooler
which would include liquid coolers
you're limited by ambient so a room
temperature 20 or whatever degrees it
may be in your house Celsius of course
so that's the big limit you can't get
below that period unless you're using
some kind of chilling effects you dry
ice or liquid nitrogen or whatever or
advanced like tech cooler stuff like
that so this is the first bottleneck you
hit or case ambient that's another one
your room maybe twenty one your case
could very easily be 35 or 40 if it's a
bad KSP in 40 so that's a that's the
first longer next one and this that
applies to liquid fin density and fin
pitch and impedance so the angle of the
fin fin pitch impacts the ability of air
to flow through it and effectively hit
things like heat pipes which are sinking
a whole lot of the heat and cool them
down the fin density matters it has to
be dense enough that there we good
example that's decent one this is a
fairly standard cooler and EXT made this
one i don't think they make it anymore
fairly standard though pretty much
everyone makes one of these so it has to
be dense enough fins that there's a lot
of surface area because a solid block is
not gonna be any good because no surface
area so a lot of surface area but it
can't be so dense that there's impedance
and you're blocking air flow which is a
really fine balance to walk some of the
cheaper ones go to hard one direction of
the other where it's either too big gap
too many big gaps or too few gaps that
are too small you can't get the air
through
it's a fast fan or it's just so loud
that you don't really want to get the
air through even if you can so those are
considerations another consideration the
smoothness of the cold plate this is a
big one that has a magnet on it not a
good example the smoothness of the cold
plate matters a lot because if you have
a rough surface for something like a CPU
cooler then you're going to be filling
more of that service with a thermal
interface so going back to I believe you
were saying this know someone else said
this is a different question going back
to what someone else said and one of
these ass Jen's the more thermal
interfaces you have between the device
under test and the cooler device the
worse
transfer you're going to have it's just
more stuff for for it to transfer
through you wanted to get into into and
out of metal as quickly as possible
putting interfaces in between is
necessary but not something you want a
lot of so the rougher it is the less
direct contact area there will be to the
IHS which means that you're going to
have more air pockets or more thermal
paste both of which are significantly
lower thermal conductivity than copper
so you want smoothness on the cold plate
that's a big factor and actually if you
look at some really really cheap air
coolers like 10 to 15 dollar budget
garbage bin then you'll see a lot of
them do have rougher finishes on the
bottom this is a problem we had with the
gtx 980ti gigabyte card extreme water
car no the air card the extreme air card
with three fans one of the problems that
I had was a really rough called plate so
that's a problem
there is an instance where that's not
true there is an instance where actually
a rougher plate is better and that
example of that would be our Computex
coverage where we talked with dare bauer
roman about his novak cooling solution
not the phase change want while not the
phase change loop but the basically tank
full of fluid and the difference there
is that because the GPU is submerged the
video card was submerged in this fluid
this low boiling point fluid 60 degree
Celsius something like that maybe maybe
40 60 s having the extra servicer
the scratches in the plate on the
surface on the top side actually does
help and that's because you're
increasing the surface area and you've
got water flowing through it so that's
an instance where what I said it's not
really quite as true but for an air
cooler smooth is better smoother is
better and then other notes I have here
let's see material the cold pipe the
cold plate and the heat pipes so and
design of the heat pipes so heat pipes
have a fluid in them and it's pretty
simple
gets down to the cold plate evaporates
from the heat boils basically goes up to
the top of the tube condenses comes back
down via capillary action and it repeats
and some tubes on the inside have a
smaller inner tube diameter than other
tubes and so even though you might have
two six millimeter or two eight
millimeter heat pipes side by side from
one vendor versus the other one could be
worse and there are few reasons one the
inside of the heat pipe could be
sintered it could be mashed it could be
weave it could be composite so these are
all different approaches to filling the
heat pipe with something to help the
liquid move through it so as an example
you might have a sintered heat pipe
where it's just basically like copper
dust more or less that's fixed to the
sidewalls of the heat pipe and that
helps the water travel through and
continue dissipating or cooling down as
it returns to a state where it can
evaporate once again and another example
will be matched which is a literal mesh
or a weave and yeah so that's an
impactor to the performance and then you
also have just the diameter of the
inside of the tube where it might be
more constrictive or not depending on
how how big the inside is not just the
outside so it might be eight but one
might have a larger inner diameter than
the other and and that will impact
performance too and other than that the
contact and surface area between the
heat pipes and the cold plate and the
IHS so it was direct contact like heat
pipe to IHS that's good but sometimes
vendors will cram in a ton of heat pipes
just so they can take the marketing box
and say yep we have eight heat pipes but
the thing is if like two of them are
overhanging the CPU not touching it or
bunch of them are half touching the CPU
not helping you'd be better off with
fewer of them that are fully touching
the CPU and fully contacted and smooth
and engaged with the service so I and
then fan speed so yeah fan speed matters
obviously to hopefully that answers your
question I really like talk I like CPU
air coolers they're fun to talk about
next one Raiden light man says why
aren't modular power supplies
standardized with the shape of the
connection to the actual unit it seems
like different brands have their own
ideas as to what shape to use whether it
looks like a mirror image of the
connector or if it looks like a giant
SATA cable what would it take for this
to be standardized
that's a hard the last part target
question how about why don't they
standardize at first I talked about this
and our video about do not mix and match
modular power supply cables cuz you'll
kill stuff and the conclusion we had was
it's not necessarily inherently bad that
they're not standardized as long as
there's a good reason for it and there
isn't always but I'll give you some of
the arguments we've heard from
manufacturers one of them is that they
just think they do it better than the
other people and so why should they
conform to someone else's standard if
they think theirs is better that's a lot
of it's like pride and sometimes it's
valid another one the company might want
to make a universal header so EVGA does
this what there's where some of their
power supplies you can just plug
whichever cable and said whatever slot
you want it'll work and there's validity
there but it's more expensive to do it's
bulkier and all the other vendors don't
want to play ball they have their own
way of doing it so that's what it comes
down to it's it's they think there are
solutions better and that's fine that's
product development and no one wants to
meet common ground whether or not it's
bad thing
it's kind of hard to say if you're not
aware that these are non-standard and
that mixing a matching kill stuff which
I would assume definitely most people
don't know that because why I mean you
would I would think the average user
especially people like the average user
doesn't watch us first of all I think
the average user you look at the end of
the cable then you go okay that's a
standardized pin out it plugs into a
motherboard it's standardized like on
our
man store to cure sex it's not that so
standardized so why would you then think
that the other side is not standardized
I don't think the average person would
jump to that I think they would probably
assume that they're all standard so
that's definitely a concern where you
have people who are gonna damage stuff
just because they didn't know any better
to be fair some of the vendors like see
sonic in the past have put stickers like
over the power button or over the power
switch over the SOT the power plug
socket that's a do not use power cables
from other power supplies so as long as
I say that I'm fine with it but why
isn't it standard I think it's just
because they all think that they can do
it better than the next person
and they're probably supply chain
reasons as well but and then also just
being different because let's face it
with power supplies even though there
are differences things like ripple a lot
of it's just not glamorous and so you
have to find something else to make it
different like oh you can plug this
cable in anywhere you want so I think
that's a lot of what it comes down to
night rush says why is it some tasks
take a while to process despite not
using 100% of a particular resource for
example decompressing a file 20% CPU no
single core is at 100 percent 5% disk is
your presenter network is there just
thread just sleeps programmed in or is
it something else
first of all I have decent half answers
to this the other half I'm not a
programmer so please keep that in mind
I'm not afraid to tell you when I run
out of my area of expertise just just
well I'll let you know when I get to
that point so first of all some tasks
take a while to process despite not
using 100% of any particular resource it
could be that giving them a hundred
percent of the resource won't speed it
up because of the programming side we've
dealt with this with our own sorceress
oh I can speak to this a bit better than
other people software we have software
in-house that processes things for like
our console benchmarking we process
really big videos sometimes compress
sometimes not and and do framerate
analysis on them and we haven't
optimized the code a whole lot because
it's not a publicly available thing so
who cares and what happens is just
because the way it's written we do
things like change how many pixels were
skipping when we're
or whether it's grayscale or not
different considerations for how long
between frames is considered terror
versus a drop versus whatever and
depending on those parameters it can
take longer or shorter to complete the
task and the codes just frankly it's
just not optimized so it runs really
poorly sometimes on certain types of
CPUs and that's all there is to it it's
just we we didn't program it with with
all thread counts in mind and program it
with all cache sizes in mind anything
like that so that's that's potential
limiter outside of code get into the
hardware stuff it could be a cache
limitation you might be running a
program that is particularly intensive
on cache you might be running a program
that is hitting something like memory
which you didn't list there's always
possibility that you're just limited by
memory frequency we've certainly seen it
before especially with our overclocking
live streams another thing here I don't
bring up a side point is that I've seen
as multi-core CPUs get more popular I've
seen a lot of people who are really
excited that their CP is not being fully
used for like anything that's not
something to be excited about if you
paid for the resources you want them to
be in use so ideally what happens is
it's a hundred percent engaged when
you're doing whatever the thing is
gaming or otherwise and then if you have
to multitask and do something that's
actually multitasking ideally there's
some thread scheduling going on either
in Windows or manually through task
manager and you can assign those
resources elsewhere not just have like
30% of your CPU unused because there's
no guarantee that that part of the CV is
gonna be used when you open the next
application so that's complete side note
but anyway I am NOT a hundred percent of
an expert on this what I can say on the
program inside let me add what I can't
say is that there might be hidden
bottlenecks you're not able to monitor
so cache is a great example of this
there could be and I don't think this is
a case with your question but there
could be thermal limitations
maybe you're hitting t.j.maxx
temperature Junction max and in doing so
it's just not able to run that the
targeted frequencies and so then you
have lower utilization overall you could
be running into
with current limitations could be
running into issues with VRM SPID
protocol between the cpu in the and the
vrm and and whether one is overheating
or the or not and a disk you mentioned
but disk is always a concern to
interfaces what interface are you going
over to get to the disk is that a
bottleneck typically not but it can be
with SATA for example stuff like that so
that's kind of my disjointed answer I
think that will give you a few things to
think about but I do think a lot of this
is going to come down to thread
scheduling windows abstraction layers
api is software and some of these things
I know more about than others but you
know that's the best I can do for you
right now
API as I can speak to briefly though
DirectX 12 dx11 and Vulcan for example
you'll see different resource
utilization than those based on how well
the game has done to program for that
thing Doom is a fantastic example Vulcan
sniper is a fantastic example of dx12 a
lot of really bad examples of dx12 and
in these tasks you'll see that something
like like dx12 that's just wrapped it's
like dx11 with the dx12 wrapper you
worst rapper name ever dx11 dx12 dx11
rapper or the inverse rather you'll end
up with poor resource utilization and
some one sense isn't actually overhead
rather than a benefit or just a lot of
problem the x12 had originally anyway
that's best I can do for you on that one
sorry
next one Red Mage Cecil Oh actually know
what for any programmers in the audience
please post a comment and just add just
add to what I said about like
specifically when you are writing code
what specific areas of optimization can
you do to improve resource utilization
make sure that a components being fully
utilized because I think we all hear
this word optimization a lot and I'm
included in this group of we all and it
doesn't always mean anything
so if you program stuff and you know
specifically like when this might apply
on a software level and not a hardware
level then please post a comment let us
know what
of things do you have to optimize what
gets optimized in your code in order to
improve performance and I think we can
all learn from that so thank you very
much if you do that take the time for it
Red Mage Cecil says on a board with poor
VRMs is it worth looking into a beefy
downdraft cooler to help keep the VR
arms cool while pushing bigger overclass
or is it not worth it because the
coolers can't handle those big clocks
anyway there's part of some truth to
that I talked about this in a previous
episode on downdraft coolers and I think
it was just like our downdraft cooler is
better or something like that it was a
nasty end video and the answer is a
downdraft cooler will help the vrm
cooling but you might become loaded on
CPUs as you said and there better ways
to cool the VRM
and ultimately the problem is just like
yeah the vrm is gonna be a bit cooler by
having that air going over even if it's
warm air this is something people lose
track of a lot where they'll say they
like they'll post comments and say well
but the air is hot because it came off
the CPU cooler and now that hot air is
going over the vrm yes but it's still
better than no air flow like a sealed
tomb and when you're talking about a
component like a MOSFET that can go to
120 plus degrees easily in really bad
conditions and bad design so in those
conditions any air flow is better than
no air flow unless it's coming out of
like like a heat gun so yes they do help
with vrm thermals but typically
downdraft coolers are going to be more
limited than your average CLC or like
big Noctua air cooler or something like
that so it's a balancing act and you'll
end up being bottlenecks by cpu before
the V arms in that case most likely but
I talked about this for several minutes
in the other sgn maybe just search the
channel for like downdraft cooler I
think you'll find it last one last one
act LZ says you do a lot of case reviews
and talk about air flow a lot would it
be possible to get a video on some good
air flow setups fan positions especially
in regards to this new trend with the
glass right it's the fans some solutions
to this for better air flow for instance
would be reverse reversing it so the air
flow comes up from the back on top
okay so yeah I get I get the gist here
we can and have talked about this the
trouble with this particular question is
if you're talking about if you're
getting cases I can give you like
guidelines but KS testing as we've said
is one of the least scientific
approaches to any kind of testing
because every single component impacts
air flow there's a radial or axial fan
on the GPU the tower cool or liquid
cooler are you what what's the fan
configuration on the case are using the
same fans does that even make sense for
a stock fans all this stuff so let me
give you some brief guidelines just
things to consider and then try to apply
those to your case because I every case
and hardware configuration will be
different so they're not all gonna be
the same like if I tell you put a fan on
the top front as intake and with this
case with this setup you might get three
degrees cooler performance that's not
gonna be three degrees for everything so
couple things to consider first one is
that even though and I've said this
before
even though hot air rises it does not
come close to combating the speed of a
fan so hot air might rise but cold air
can rise to when you're blasting it
through a 2,000 rpm fan so things to
consider here several times in our
testing there's been cases where if you
take a fan and mount it in the top but
not the back the top front as in before
the CPU cooler and sort of the canonical
view of the airflow pipeline as it were
you mount it to the top front as intake
that'll push air basically straight into
the CPU it won't have to contend with
the GPU for or any other components it's
just for the CPU that works really well
in a lot of cases you have dust
considerations here I'm not going to
talk about those too much today but
there are dust considerations keep that
in mind so that's one thing a lot of
people don't think about is is it's just
and myself included many years ago when
I was starting is that you think I
should put exhaust in the top because
that just makes sense and it does
absolutely but for some cases with tower
coolers especially is actually better
just to do top intake another thing to
consider exhaust in the top in the top
front will actually oftentimes hurt CPU
performance and that's because if you
have air coming in from the front of the
case and you have
an exhaust fan here and at our cooler
here just kind of imagine it all the air
comes in and like half of its gonna get
pulled straight out it'll never touch a
single component on the case
it'll get removed from the system before
it gets to the CPU and so we've done
tests on in case reviews before where
you'll see thermals are much worse
actually when you have any path of
exhaust that is reached by the intake
before it reaches a component to cool
down set component so that's
consideration you could do for example
another thing to consider top intake
again if you do top intake but it's kind
of like behind the CPU cooler it's
certainly not gonna help the CPU very
much at that point especially I mean
it's most likely just going in and then
out of the exhaust fan but if it's
behind or above the tower cooler and
just blowing air like say above blowing
air through the fins and down then
you'll get your GPU a couple degrees
warmer maybe one two three not much that
does apply pretty universally that's
because you're now putting hot air into
the back of GPU so that's something to
think about
bottom intake is a great way to cool the
GPU power supplies Stroud's are a great
way to obstruct cooling to the GPU but
there are shrouds that work really well
like NZXT h 500 trout just happens to
work actually pretty damn well
so yeah bottom intakes great way if your
case supports it and it's near the GPU
to get video card temperatures down
specifically side intake is absolutely
unbeatable for GPU cooling especially
but CPU and some scenarios and that's
just because it's so damn close closer
you get the fan especially if it's also
still close to the source of the intake
cuz you get the fan of the component the
cooler the components gonna be when the
air hits it cuz the air doesn't have to
travel as far and so the pressure is
gonna be higher and so I'll be able to
push it'll be able to help dissipate
more heat off of whatever fin snag your
cooling other things to consider what
else should I mention here trying to oh
yeah this is a good one the BitFenix end
so this is something that I think is
it's pretty uncommon to consider we
certainly didn't consider till we
fifteen exam so I had an interesting one
so if you mounted a fan can't remember
photos at the top or the middle but it
had three two or three fan slots on the
front and what would happen is if you
mounted a fan or two fans and some of
them but not the last one or two slots
it would actually get because there was
no place where air to exhaust in that
case really or there was at least less
exhaust space than there was in take
space what would happen is the hot air
would go through the cooler or whatever
on the CPU some of it would get out of
the case but it doesn't have enough
pressure to get all of it out and the
pressure system is positive intake so
what happens is a lot of it recirculates
around the cooler and it'll either get
sucked back in as warmed air and just
kind of cycle and create this nasty
cycle or it'll actually get pulled
towards the front of the case by the
intake fans because the intake fans
aren't exposed enough to the outside so
they apply an air in from inside the
case behind them and it'll recirculate
back through there and that's that's
pretty interesting phenomenon that we
saw with the N so if you want to check
it out a bit Phoenix on so so I know
that's there's a lot more here to talk
about that's pretty good I think you
could also add directional fans inside
the case that aren't directly exposed to
air but are just directional to redirect
the air that's gotten into the case so
like something just on a spike over the
VRM or something if it's a gigantic huge
case you have like another fan and here
somewhere just to kind of keep the air
directed at the component you want to
direct to that and things like that and
then pressure systems also consider so
it is kind of interesting too in our H
500 review the NZXT one we found that
having two exhaust fans actually worked
way better than we thought
even for GPU cooling and part of that is
because it was a negative pressure
system the air is only going out so cool
air will find its way in through
whatever holes are in the case to
equalize the pressure system and some of
that meant that air was getting actually
pulled in through the back of the
expansion slot for the PCI expansion
slot the video card and getting pulled
into the video
from outside the back of the case and
actually worked pretty well but then
there are other times where like in the
a C's Mini ITX prototype we saw it
Computex talked about with in the video
with - about products that most need
improvement at Computex another thing
that can happen is you might have
exhaust like from the power supply at
the back and then pressure system that
will pull some of that air in and into
the video car and that just happens
based on if it's like a negative
pressure system or something like that
there's nowhere else for to get access
to air lots of really fun things yeah
that's super quick recap quick of some
of our case testing of the last year I
can't possibly do it justice and sum it
all up keep watching our case reviews we
talked about it all the time I think
that gives you a few cool ideas that of
what can happen and hopefully you can
just just look at your own case and try
to think about where each of those make
sense it's different for every case I've
given you guidelines I think you can use
them to figure out what makes sense in
your scenario that's it for this one we
just shot that's third one after moving
furniture and building it for like 16
plus hours yesterday and then also
coming home and doing way more work for
videos so sorry I'm a bit tired
stick with me you've got a really cool
office movie coming up so we're looking
forward to it because it's gonna be a
lot more technical content and we could
do here and I yeah subscribe for more go
to patreon.com/scishow Saxons Thomas I
directly go to store gamers Nexus dotnet
to pick up one of our mod mats they are
in stock and shipping now and we're
trying to keep them in stock but we're
having trouble so we might run out of
this run as well get your order in
sooner than later if you want it
otherwise video card posters we have in
abundance they are pretty popular and I
signed 10 at 10 of them which are being
distributed at random as people buy
these so it might be a couple of those
left as well I might go signing a couple
more just for fun
next time I'm over there it's it for
this one thanks for watching I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
