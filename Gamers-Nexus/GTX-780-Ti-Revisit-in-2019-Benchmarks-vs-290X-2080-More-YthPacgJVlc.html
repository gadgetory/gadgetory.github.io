from October of 2013 and now it's time
to look back at the GTX 780 Ti from
November of 2013 the 780 Ti shipped for
$700 and landed as Nvidia's flagship
against Andy's freshly launched flagship
it was a different era memory capacity
was limited to 3 gigabytes on the 780ti
memory frequency was a blazing 7
gigabits per second and core clock was
875 mega Hertz stock or 928 megahertz of
boost where as we're nearing 2 gigahertz
these days and that also was using the
old Boost 2.0 algorithm that kept a
fixed clock in gaming overclocking was
more extensible in some ways giving us
more control for an upward punch than
modern Nvidia overclocking but the card
of course has still aged so today we're
looking at how well it has aged and
we'll also have our 9 to 90 X numbers in
there for point of reference before that
this video is brought to you by the
gigabyte z3 90 ARS master motherboard
which comes equipped with one of the
more powerful z3 90 V RMS for heavier
overclocks on the new 9th gen intel cpus
the ARS master is also one of the few
motherboards with a real heatsink this
generation featuring a mix of high
surface area fins and looks oriented
cover blocks oh and it's also got
updated RTV illumination learn more at
the link below
the 780ti ends up originally at about
the price today that an RT X 2080 would
be but the difference is a couple fold
higher on the 2080 so you'll see that in
some of our testing today the design of
course was different but things like the
power envelope weren't too different
from today's high-end cards of course
the difference being that for the same
amount of power today you get
significantly more performance the 780
Ti is potential biggest limitation and
modern game testing is going to be its
memory at 3 gigabytes of gddr5 seven
gifts per second isn't that slow but
most of the modern g5 cards are 8
gigabits per second or 9 g5 extra at 10
and then for GD gr 6 it's approaching 12
14 gigabits per second depending so
quite a bit different there but let's
get into the benchmarks today we'll have
some additional testing notes in the
article linked in the description below
as always if you're curious what test
platform we used
through the numbers we have apex legends
in here as well although that's the only
game that does not have the 290x in it
and then we can talk conclusions
assuming anyone out there is still using
a 780ti and wants to upgrade rather than
our usual starting point of Sniper Elite
4 or apex legends we'll start instead
with GTA 5 this is a 2015 launch so it's
closer to the 780 Ti is 2013 launch than
our other test titles at 1080p and with
very high and ultra settings with 2x
msaa the 780ti still pulls its weight at
68 FPS average with at lows surprisingly
well spaced at 50 fps and 41 fps 1% and
0.1% the 780ti therefore ends up just
behind the 290x with both of these being
reference cards with stock settings the
modern gtx 1066 gigabyte gaming x runs
at 83 FPS average outpacing the former
flagship 780ti by an impressive 22
percent the 980ti remember there was no
800 series ended up 47% ahead of the
780ti and was its direct successor
generationally the 1080 TI also ends up
about 126 percent ahead were over 2
times higher in performance it's sort of
silly to use percentages at this point
so the takeaway is that 153 FPS average
on the 1080 TI allows graduation to
significantly higher graphics settings
or higher resolutions overclocking is
completely insane on the 780 Ti compared
to a lot of the cards today it's fun
honestly and that's what makes us miss
the older end video designs that were
less it locks it down with a 220
megahertz core offset and a 400
megahertz memory offset we ended up at
83 FPS average which is a mass of 22%
improvement over the stock 68 FPS
average performance this would be higher
than the factory overclocked partner
model 780 Ti is as well so you get a
full representation of the range here
you would have to overclock those
further to get better than this
overclocking gives us a more direct
voltage control and clock control than
modern generations resulting in
performance that matches the gtx 1066
gigabyte nearly identically the r9 290x
overclocked to about 73 FPS average with
its performance allowing the 780 Ti to
take a lead once pushed of course a
partner model 290x could theoretically
push a bit further but the 780ti
partners would end up in the lead anyway
so it just does well in this game
for frame time consistency comparisons
the r9 290x ends up about 14 to 16
milliseconds frames of frame interval on
average with minimal deviation from one
frame to the next frame times need to be
consistent and should ideally not
exhibit variance greater than 8
milliseconds of 12 milliseconds from one
frame to the next
the 290x succeeds here and is acceptable
in frame time consistency the GTX 780 Ti
plotting that next also does well and it
up functionally tied with the 290x it
almost completely obscures the 290x line
overall and has mostly equal performance
for the actual player there's one spike
up to 32 milliseconds and then a
corrective spike down but beyond the
single instance the rest is about the
same between the two cards at 1440p the
780 Ti falls to 49 FPS average at
decline of 27% from a 1080p results this
also puts it as about on par with an r9
290x for gigabyte card or an rx 588
gigabyte modern card for reference the
980ti maintains a rough 47 percent lead
here so the relative scaling is about
the same as at 1080p and a used gtx 1070
might be an affordable upgrade for you
although even a modern r-tx 2060 at $350
offers a 63% performance uplift under
these settings overclock so the GTX 780
Ti ends up at a firm 60 FPS average
giving us a reasonable frame rate for
actual gameplay
despite Lois struggling a bit the
overclocked FPS puts it at 1060 OC
levels with the 290 x OC stuck closer to
51 FPS average 4k wasn't even remotely
common in 2013 this was far from the
reaches of gaming GPUs at the time as
illustrated with the 780 Ti is 25 FPS
average at 4k this is the sort of test
that people likely would have scoffed at
as synthetic back in the day but today
even though the former flagship 780ti
and r9 290x are roughly tied in their
inability to play it still takes a
modern $500 card to reasonably begin
playing with these settings the RT X
2070 at $500 could absolutely be made to
work with the settings reductions to
this title although that may be
undesirable for some overclocking the
780 Ti gets into 30 FPS average which is
still clearly not enough particularly
when considering the frame time
performance is sporadic and places us at
13 FPS or 1% lows translating the frame
time spy
upwards of 90 milliseconds that means
that sometimes you don't get a new frame
for a full tenth of a second
apex legends is up next we don't have as
many cards tested here since we only
recently added it but the test gives a
look at one of the most popular modern
games that has come across our bench
apex legends uses the source 2 engine
and DirectX 11 building on top of the
platform that titanfall 2 laid out for
it
this one omits the 290 X and our results
because it was tested previously and not
retested but will show plenty of 290 X
numbers following apex legends at 1080p
the GTX 780 Ti stock card runs at high
settings with a 46 FPS average allowing
the GTX 970 SC elite a 40% over the test
780ti overclock the 780 Ti does allow it
to gain an impressive 21% performance
over its baseline stock performance
although this still isn't enough to top
the 970 if you're looking to jump to
another flagship the 980 TI hybrid
operates at 80 FPS average stock which
is about a 75% increase over the stock
780ti the 1080 Ti is a couple times
higher in performance and is capable of
4k whereas the 780 Ti would struggle
even with 1440p in this title f1 2018
uses the ego engine and offers a good
look at other racing games made by
Codemasters as they all run on roughly
the same engine
everyone 2018 also has some interesting
quirks like its desire for higher
performance system memory although
that's irrelevant where we control for
non GPU variables at 1080p the 780ti
ends up at 59 FPS average with ultra
high settings that's pretty good for a
card this old and considering that the
quality can be dropped significantly to
maintain higher FPS if desired frame
times are rough in this game in general
although not for Vega for some reason
but average FPS plants the 780ti as
below the 290x is 65 FPS average the
290x also maintains better frames time
consistency in this test path
overclocking the 780 Ti it propels it to
nearing 70 FPS average approaching the
GTX 970 s performance that's not
particularly compelling performance when
considering the tremendous step-down
that the 970 is from a flagship
overclocked in the 290x lands at about
390 X levels on surprisingly since the
390 X's function in overclock to 90 X
with some memory increases in capacity
at 1440p the 780 Ti runs at about 46 FPS
average stock and 54 FPS average
overclocked switch ranks it is
comparable to a 390 x4 290x stock card
well
780ti has its overclock applied the
980ti holds a I honestly dove 76% over
the stock 780ti indicating that we may
be running into some architectural
limitations or maybe even memory
limitations on the limited three
gigabyte frame buffer that these 780ti
has 4k has the 780 Ti at 28 fps Howard
with an overclocked barely improving
frame rate same time performance is
dismal here making this game unplayable
with these settings the 290x also
struggles although not to the extent of
the 780 Ti but it's sort of irrelevant
because they both really don't produce a
good experience anyway at 4k far cry 5
positions the 780 Ti at 49 FPS average
with our graphics settings ranking it as
between the 290 x 58 FPS average and 960
SSC is 44 FPS average even though our X
570 outperforms a 780ti running at 59
FPS average and with consistent frame
time performance the 980ti outperforms
the 780ti style card by 78% jump in 288
FPS average from 49 FPS average
overclocked in the 780 Ti puts it
between the 390 X and 290x cards just
for comparison that 1440p performance
falls to 35 FPS average allowing the 290
axial lead of 22 percent stock that said
overclocking the 780 Ti ties it up to
the 2 nd X stock and gets it close to to
90 X overclocked performance although
the 290x reference card still maintains
a lead the 980ti can play this game
reasonably well at 1440p whereas the 780
Ti struggles without a graphics quality
reduction showing that the 980ti
if you could get a used one for cheap
might be a decent consideration for an
upgrade for k performance has the 780 Ti
at 18 FPS average marking it as clearly
unfit for 4k
again that's really no surprise given
the 4k market didn't exist in 2013 for
the most part other old cards also
struggle here and even the 1080 TI ends
up technically below 60 FPS average
although it's close enough to make
things work with the settings change so
I've really four is the last one and
will only be tested at 1080p for this
card we normally also do 4k synthetics
in this game but we'll stick to 1080p
for the 780ti in today's sniper elite 4
benchmark stock settings run the game at
73 FPS average ranks it as between the
960 and rx 570 the 290x runs 98 FPS
average stock and we should note that
this game is more compute-intensive
specifically so that's the specific
reason why we see an advantage on
the cards like the 290x versus the 780ti
with a 780ti overclock we end up at 88
FPS average to close in on the RX 570
but see that the 290 act still holds the
lead of 11% over the 780ti overclocked
benchmark the 290x climbs further with
its own overclock approaching levels of
the RX 588 gigabyte if you're still
using a 780ti today first of all
congratulations on making a card last
that long it's a good one it was a good
card it's still not bad really at 1080p
but if you're upgrading primary reasons
for doing so would be increasing your
resolution maybe pushing the graphics
settings a bit higher but resolutions
really the big driver there where when
this card came out 1080p was that it
still is but was a more domineering
force in the market 1440p was starting
to kind of get some traction 4k was just
not in anyone's minds today it's it's
quite a bit different from that so six
years ago the same price for the 780ti
would get you roughly a 1080i 20/80
today be spend about $100 more probably
but the twenty eighty is a massive shift
of course Radeon 7 is a competitor as
well we have notes on that if you're
curious about its performance but just
strictly speaking sort of Nvidia flash
with NVIDIA flagship well today the
flagship is $1200 and that's the twenty
atti
so if you're still in the same price
range unfortunately you're probably not
buying another flagship today unless you
wanted to get the 980 TI used which is
probably a pretty good price at this
point assuming you can find some in your
region that are used it's a a still
significant performance uplift in some
cases 70 + % an average frame rate but
if you wanted something new than 20 70
20 80 even the 2060 are all pretty
decent upgrades and so on I'm cheaper
than others so versus the r9 290x both
have the 290x has aged better in some
games that 780 Ti has aged better in
other games you can look at GTA versus
f1 for example and where the 290 act
seems to do a bit better on average
would be games that make heavier use of
compute so if you're playing for example
I believe shadow of war or Wolfenstein 2
those are both pretty compute heavy 290x
would would likely have a bit of an edge
although we didn't test those two
specific games f1 2018 is another good
example though so anyway that's it the
Saudi ATI today so it's closer to a 1066
gigabyte than just about anything else
sometimes it is even outclassed by an rx
570 again depending on the type of game
so it it has fallen quite far but it's
still aged reasonably well the 290x
clearly has also really not aged that
poorly this particular model not great
but the overclocks we did on it give you
and the 390x give you an upward upper
limit of where the 290x would have
fallen in a very high-performing
scenario so that's it for this one
