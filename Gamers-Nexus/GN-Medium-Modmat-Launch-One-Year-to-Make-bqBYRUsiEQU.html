made to our high quality standards and
we learned a lot along the way that we
can share with you all in this video the
gamers Nexus at medium mod matte took a
year of requests from viewers like you
feedback and experience for the large
mod mats to finally make this is a 32
inch by 16 inch anti-static PC building
surface meant to protect your desk and
components while building systems
deleting CPUs of modern GPUs or working
with liquid cooling components the GPO
teardown diagram shows common placement
of MOSFETs inductors capacitors BIOS
chips shunt resistors and more offering
some guidance when putting a block on a
card for example or shorting the shunt
resistors which can be aided further by
checking our PCIe wiring diagram to
check shunt legs against the 12-volt
pins on PCIe connectors we also added
mounting hole spacing for common GPUs to
help with determining the right screw
placement on new cooling blocks
something we'll talk about more later as
it changed mid development with thanks
to torrents at launch a lot of you have
asked for a smaller version of the large
mod mat that we've been signed for over
a year now so we finally got this medium
variant made and on the store at store
dawkins nexus dotnet and this is what
we're gonna talk about today because
it's a big experience for us and we've
learned a lot along the way of making
this product to celebrate the launch of
the mod mat we have 25 out of the signed
ones that are also numbered so you might
get lucky if you buy one of the sign
mats and get one that's numbered 1
through 25 we're only doing this for the
launch just to kind of celebrate it and
they are mixed in there randomly with
that first batch so if you buy during
the first batch then you may get one of
those as for what the mod mat is just
like the large mod mat it's a high
quality material that's made in a
factory that makes stuff for cleanroom
so these are serious factories and it's
a real proper anti-static material comes
with the common ground point the wrist
strap all of that stuff and it does
connect directly to ground to make sure
it gets rid of any charge and then
finally there's also a ruler on there
for quick measurements if you need a
quick reference ruler for doing any of
your GPU mods or maybe quick cuts on
liquid cooling and tubing so this
project started in about January January
23rd of 2018 so over
and people of course wanted a smaller
version of the mod mat which has been so
popular that we still can't keep it in
stock even today but we're trying it's
it's been wanted for a while now and
what this project the medium one started
with we didn't know it would take this
tremendously long to really get it the
way we wanted it but we're very happy
with how it turned out it started with
an email I just sent to Andrew who did
the the design of this as a reminder of
what we wanted so we determined we
wanted a GPO teardown themes mat which
you can see in the mat itself we've got
the video card outline it has a
component names if you're taking a part
of card the first time you might not
know what some of those things are so
they're labeled and actually this has
been in development for so long that we
made the video card that's on the mat
and the labeling and everything before
we made that poster which is been on
sale for several months now so the
design on that poster if you have one
the same video card Anatomy poster we
sell in the store you've basically had a
preview of the medium mod mat without
even knowing it so there's your easter
egg so you have that ended up on the
poster it was designed for the mod mat
and then we also did the dual silhouette
then I talked about we've got TV Hall
spacing and then at the top corner over
here we have the types of screws that
are used in the most common types of
video cards so you can see the name of
the screw and the the type of the bit
you're going to need to remove it which
is just kind of helpful if again maybe
you're not as as used to working with
some of the cards or even if you are it
just helps to kind of know what things
are called so you can buy the correct
ones or pre-prepare for the card coming
in so anyway that email there were some
changes along the way of course but that
was January 23rd of 2018 the initial
design was sent to our distributor and
about mid April of 2018 and then from
there we just started iterating on it
really quickly so lots of design small
changes just to kind of make sure it
came out exactly how we wanted it in
terms of things like legibility or
vibrance and how bright the colors are
the large mats have been in use in this
office on basically every workbench and
work service since we moved in and then
use daily and we haven't replaced any of
them so durability wise we're pretty
happy with it and that was applied here
now
other things I guess on sort of the to
give you some insight as to what
manufacturing sort of throws at people
this has once again taught us a lot
about what the the component
manufacturers go through in the space so
just like we talked about last time with
the large mats one of the biggest
benefits for us other than product we're
obviously extremely proud of is that
we've learned what the manufacturers
have to go through when they're getting
stuff made and so you start to learn how
compromise works and how the timelines
work and just sampling we have a pile of
samples like these are some of them and
we have a whole bunch of others so these
are all samples pre-production samples
that we got made each one of these plus
baby the four others that we have behind
the camera represents about a month in
time and it's just from changes being
made has to be shift obviously back and
forth we have to communicate with the
factory to get new tooling done things
like that for cutting the the mat size
just perfectly and over time obviously
it adds up that's where we end up with a
year of distance from starting the
project and having to change things out
like where it used to say Polaris and
now says Torian because Torian didn't
exist when we started designing this mat
so its name probably wasn't even final
at the time so just to show you what we
are where we're coming from this is the
final design that you can buy on the
store again on store documents excess
net and it does come with the common
ground point that goes right here
and it also comes with a wrist strap as
well that's all in the store show you
where we came from though you know
manufacturers typically don't show you
their prototypes because they really
only want you to see the final thing but
we're fine with showing what we've
learned from and part of this so just
again we've got Polaris this is one of
the first set this might be the first
sample so Polaris is right there and
that was removed just because it sort of
I mean we started when the rx 580 was
really big and another RX 5 90s out of
course but Pascal their Vega and now
we've got Torian on the final version
with updated design so like Andrew went
through and did this stuff it's pretty
cool actually so in the original we just
had a block
diagram pretty similar to what you would
see on line for a GPU and we changed it
to have the outlines of the dye and the
memory modules and so the end result is
you have Vega here this is an actual
Vega dye for 64 or 56 and it more or
less lines up perfectly and you can see
the sort of the component outline which
is just sort of neat and then torian's
over here at Pascal's over here and
those are just big die GPUs they don't
have HBM on them so saturation we worked
really hard on so we really got this
saturation up and were able to keep the
durability by working with the factory
just back and forth over several samples
took a lot of time to get it done but it
was really important to us to have a
good saturation a good durability on the
mat and it took some time but we were
able to work with them on the printing
process to get it done and then also
small stuff like well this is a user
request even so you see the snap
location was on the top right up here
near the grid originally and now we've
got it kind of flipped here now we've
moved it so it is in the bottom left and
the reasoning for this after kind of
listening to some of you viewers in our
audience and we appreciate your feedback
the reasoning for this is I mean if
you're over here with all your screws on
the silhouette and you've got the snap
up here then the wires going to drag
across the silhouette and sort of
scramble the screws so it made a lot of
sense and that was good feedback from
our audience and we did incorporate that
that's the design then that's the new
media mod mat this is on the store
already as of this video the large Maps
still being sold it's still extremely
popular we're still struggling to keep
it in stock you have to remember a
couple of things we've learned here as
we've gone through this process is of
course one is time and money are the
biggest resources in any kind of
development and that's why we as a
smaller outfit you can't make like
millions of products and just ship them
out all the time so we really appreciate
your support you're helping a small
company do its thing it allows us as
I've said before it remain independent
from as many advertisers as we can and
push our own store stuff instead so it
allows us to just
can you say and whatever I want to say
on camera about companies like I don't
know Walmart so just a recent example
there that's still fresh in our minds
but yeah other issues that have come up
you're always dealing with timelines so
working with the other side of the world
means that sort of dealing with timezone
changes and and then of working with
like Lunar New Year for example can sort
of interrupt the production process and
and it's often a bigger impact than you
might think this affects the entire
industry and working on the mat taught
us that when Andy launched for example
Radeon seven in the middle of lunar new
actually at just the beginning of it it
can impact things like how quickly can
you get more products made to hit the
shelves because it's a you know it's a
vacation time and so that's something
we've sort of learned more directly
through working on products we've
learned about also the the sampling
timelines each one of these again like a
month and time to get it made and to
come back here and then provide feedback
and then get another one made and
because we started this in January of
2018 we also towards the end of the year
started encountering concerns with
tariffs does the tariff increase that
might or might not happen again from the
perspective of 2018 does that affect us
and it did because shipping costs went
up a lot because people were panicking
trying to get everything out of the port
before any change happened to the
tariffs so there was a lot of stuff we
encountered it's been a great learning
experience and again the end result is a
product that we're very proud of so if
you want to pick it up it's on store
dock gamers Nexus dotnet it comes with
the common ground point the wrist strap
in the manual just like the large one
does it's just that it's a bit smaller
now
so if four feet by two feet and freedom
units was too large for you there's now
a 32 inch by 16 inch in freedom units
mat for you and I'll put the metric on
the store so because I can't do the
conversion in my head check that out
thank you for watching thank you again
for supporting us and those of you who
bought the first round of or the large
match and provided thoughts on like
where the the snap placement should go
that's of course extremely helpful
feedback we appreciate it we did take it
to heart and act on it for future
products so
much appreciated there thanks for
watching subscribe for more I'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
