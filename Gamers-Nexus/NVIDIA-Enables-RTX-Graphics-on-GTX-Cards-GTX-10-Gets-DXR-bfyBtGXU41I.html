same time as GDC is starting and that
means a lot of Nvidia news today we're
talking about DX are coming to Pascal
cards which means that sort of to some
extent RT X is coming to Pascal cards
and also talking about some actually
pretty cool
AI research that's been done and you may
find interesting
for example effortlessly generating a
sort of realistic landscape almost like
a computer version of Bob Ross where you
have as a viewer or user minimal skill
but through following the software I can
produce at maximum quality output so
we're talking about both of those today
before that this video is brought to you
by the gigabyte zi 390 ARS master
motherboard which comes equipped with
one of the more powerful zi 390 VRMs for
heavier overclocks on the new 9th gen
intel cpus the ARS master is also one of
the few motherboards with a real
heatsink this generation featuring a mix
of high surface area fins and looks
oriented cover blocks oh and it's also
got updated our DV illumination learn
more at the link below let's start off
with the DX our stuff so DX ours come in
two gtx pascal cards that'll start with
1066 gigabyte and up 1063 gigabyte and
below from our understanding will not be
supported this will be done through a
driver flip in the april release so
there will be a just a switch where they
can flip it on or off and through the
april drivers pascal 1066 plus will be
supported for DX r so if you're playing
a game like battlefield 5 or shadow the
Tomb Raider wants the update comes out
then and you have Pascal 1080i maybe
you'll be able to use the XR features
with that card this also supports
touring GTX cards which do not have the
RT cores or tensor cores enabled but are
still capable of running the XR s DX
Harvey don't know it's a direct x12
Microsoft feature if you have a DX 12
ready card then you already have a DX
already car the difference is that the
physical Hardware on the touring cards
will better accelerate ray-tracing
and you'll be doing DL SS then the
tensor cores will celebrate accelerate
DL SS so it'll run slower for sure with
Pascal or with GTX 1660 type cards but
it will
and that's changing with the April
update so that's what you need to know
they're the basics anyway for a bit more
information what's going on here is that
anybody gave a few examples we're in a
hypothetical scenario this is something
we don't get to see a lot so it's kind
of cool
hypothetical scenario is that to run
Metro with DXR at 60fps
using Pascal meaning no RT acceleration
no tensor cores anything like that just
using Pascal architecture and video did
some calculations and basically just
some mental math simulation and found
that they would need about 44 teraflops
from about 11:00 on the ten atti of
floating-point performance in order to
run 60fps Metro at 1440p instead of 18
where they are today and that's with the
XR enabled so that piece of hardware
which doesn't exist would be about a 650
watt TDP and would have 35 billion
transistors so clearly Nvidia took the
approach instead of building RT quarters
into it into its GP as we've already
talked about that story line in addition
to this in the presentation and video
gave us a look that we don't normally
get to see where we see V so the
rendering pipeline as it's happening on
different types of cards or
architectures so you can see in the
pipeline there's traditional rendering
at the front the really big bar in the
middle is ray tracing where either it's
using our T cores or it's not and for
the ones that are slow or the longer
bars there they are not using our T
course to accelerate now there's
traditional rendering at the end so the
interesting bit is that you can actually
see now visualize the ups and downs from
accessing memory things like that
towards the end of the pipeline or where
you see the purple stacked on top of the
gray you can see the concurrency of
integer and floating-point where with
the taurine hardware as we've already
discussed integer and floating-point
operations can run simultaneously and
this does affect gaming and the more
compute heavy games like shadow of war
or Sniper Elite 4 or something like that
and we have a full interview with Nvidia
on that from previously so the ray
tracing workload introduces some more
integer instructions and then you use
the RT acceleration and obviously it
gets a whole lot easier to run so the
short version of that part of the news
is that there's a drive
in April it's enabling r-tx Orwell DXR
on Pascal cards we've already talked
about which ones it's not going to run
particularly well compared to the RT
Hardware this should not surprise
anybody and so we asked well what's
what's your objective why are you
enabling this then for cards that won't
really run it that well what's the goal
and the goal is twofold so on the
developer side this encourages
developers to build out more DXR
features because there's a greater
install base and if you have a game
where maybe the graphics aren't as
intensive you could maybe get away with
enabling some specific DXR features like
shadows or ray-traced reflections or
whatever one-off feature you want to use
so there's a bigger install base which
is more encouragement for developers to
grow DXR inclusion in games and then
separately on the developer side it does
expand the developer install base to
where if they don't all have our tea or
our TX cards and now they can start
working with DX our inclusion in games
anyway on the gaming side and banette
gave us their answer but our take on it
is this on the gaming side it's sort of
like a test drive where it allows the
user to enable the feature and if
they're unhappy with performance it's
fine they turn it off but they still get
to see it as that might be a bit of
encouragement to push people to upgrade
to RTX cards because they can see what
the difference is and if they really
like it but they don't have the
performance and clearly they know what
to buy and it's going to be a four star
TX upgrade in that use case so that's
kind of how we interpret it this isn't
necessarily bad actually it's it's
overall good to make DXR I mean to
enable it on cards that clearly already
support it even if they don't run it
well let the user make the decision if
they don't want to have a low framerate
but it should still run decently with
low settings and games where you can
drop down like battlefield 5 and so
we'll do testing as it becomes relevant
but April is the update for that and
split focus on gamers and developers
epic games will have a briefing at GDC
on March 20th we've already shown Epic
Games Unreal Engine updates we're using
the second preview build there's there
are more of them now and we'll have more
of those shown off soon too in our
videos but epics got an official update
coming out
and then unity is also adding DXR
support for developers so you're gonna
see some more developers starting to
expand on their titles with DXR effects
but keep in mind that many games are in
development from ophélie years so it
could be a little bit before we see them
to answer the question preemptively
developers don't have to enable anything
for games that are already out with DXR
features it'll just work with the driver
update so you won't be waiting for
developers and this is really meant for
basic ray tracing now on the research
side the interesting thing here was a we
we have Jim Vincent on the floor at GTCC
for us and he sent this information a
lot to me they have Gauguin a new
software utility that does sort of AI
generated a scenery and this is where
it's like again an AI version of Bob
Ross where you feed it in some really
basic skill listen put as a user who has
absolutely no artistic ability and you
get something that that's actually
pretty presentable and that's because in
this case of a machine is interpreting
it for you and turning it into something
with a bit more quality and this is done
through segmentation so what you do is
you use the different brushes in there
so you can have like a a snow brush a
sky brush see brush different landscapes
forests whatever use the brush you paint
a broad stroke and the software will
interpret what that means relative to
the other elements in the scene and so
in the demonstration shown where Brian
Catanzaro who is the VP of applied deep
learning research and someone we've
actually met at GCC previously does
really good work and I'm really on the
research side he was talking about how
it all works and shows some footage of
painting basic things like mountains
with just a brown brush basically and
then it comes out as as something that's
interpreted by AI so some basic
information here again as in Gow game
the software is a generative adversarial
network and it's used for converting
segmentation maps into images from
NVIDIA zone press release and then
Catanzaro said in his interview in the
video that quote I really think this
technology is going to be great for
architects designers that people make
virtual worlds to train robots and cars
so actually a very good point they're
not necessarily something for the
average end-user but still pretty cool
stuff and other than that Nvidia did
have announcements about CUDA X could ax
a we don't have details yet and when he
announced a T for GPU or something like
that don't have any details yet at time
of filming but they will be out by the
time this video goes up and there's a
new quad row car door or maybe they were
just talking about the Quadro 8000 RT X
that's already been announced publicly
and then Nvidia omniverse and we also we
don't have a lot of information on that
either it's just an app that connects a
bunch of other apps so the really
interesting stuff here is going to be
DXR on Pascal and then that gal got app
just kind of neat so that's it for this
one thank you for watching as always
