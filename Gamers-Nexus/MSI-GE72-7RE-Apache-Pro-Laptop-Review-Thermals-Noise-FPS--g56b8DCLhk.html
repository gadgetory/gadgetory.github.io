for bloatware in our previous msi ge70
to 7r e laptop coverage but today we're
reviewing the laptop in full and we
won't really be talking about the
software since there's a fully
independent video just on that topic
this laptop has a 1050 Ti a 7700 HQ i7
processor and is priced at 1200 to 1300
dollars which makes it an interesting
candidate for what could be a smaller
form factor notebook for gaming but ends
up being a bit larger at 17.3 inches
before that this video is brought to you
by Corsair is it new Vengeance RGB LED
Ram which ships with custom screens ICS
for better overclocking performance and
stability given that memory is highly
relevant for performance with new rise
in CPUs now is a good time to do
research on high performance kits start
with the Vengeance RGB LED kit at the
link in the description below so start
off with just the hardware on this one
it is again 1,200 to 1,300 dollars it
includes an i7 CPU and the GPU is a 1050
Ti that makes this combination of
hardware pretty appealing for a smaller
form factor but again this screen comes
in at 17 point 3 inches so it doesn't
quite fit what uh what my preference
would be for form factor with the
components however we can still look at
the thing as a whole and then obviously
if you wanted a smaller one they have
smaller options with similar components
it's just the thermals in the noise will
be a bit different but that
notwithstanding let's look at the
solution on the inside here then work
our way around the rest of the unit for
the hard drive this particular model at
the price is one terabyte hard drive 128
gigabyte SSD there suppliers do change
these if they don't specify them however
this one is actually a 128 gigabyte SSD
from Toshiba and then the memory is 16
gigabytes - this one has got 2 8
gigabyte DIMMs right there for the rest
of it
the cooling solution is handled by two
fans there's a 2 band setup which does
impact noise as we'll see a bit later in
the noise testing one fan on each side
the CPU is oriented is positioned here
on the units and the GP is positioned
here and these two share a cooling
solution to sum
that now the CPU is a bit isolated
because it's got two of its copper heat
pipes that feed over here and get cooled
largely by this fan whereas the GPU is
going more over with these pipes but it
does have one that runs alongside the
CPU cooling and in between that line
from the GPU to the my right side of the
notebook there are some of the power
components so you get the MOSFETs and
then doctors over here where MSI has
another aluminium plate that covers
those and it's connected via thermal pad
and that covers most of the power
components they don't cover all of them
they've got the inductors contacted from
the thermal pad to the aluminum plate
and then one of the power components one
of the FETs down here and one of the
inductors is not covered seems a bit odd
but whatever I guess they didn't want to
do it so that's that's the cooling
design this design actually as we'll see
in thermal testing in a moment where
it's pretty damn well and the reason it
does work well is because of that 17.3
inch form factor for the screen so it's
a wider notebook which means you have
more real estate to deal with the
thermals that's the biggest challenge
with thermals on these things because
they have more surface area to spread
this out with pretty a pretty big amount
of copper I mean that weighs you down a
little bit but the trade-off is better
thermals so that helps with cooling but
it does have a weird trade-off where
because of their thermal solution is
flanking the battery the battery
actually ends up quite small and that's
another thing we'll look at the battery
testing so this battery could be a bit
larger and this is something that we
wish MSI might consider in the future if
as I did something like ditch this and I
know this notebook is one of the few
form factors where it'll just barely fit
an optical drive and people want that
while some people anyway
but if they'll ditch this and maybe
relocate some of their cooling solution
then they could run a larger battery and
that is one of the trade-offs side this
this kind of stuff gets into the
personal preference a bit but with a
laptop like this my preference is better
battery life and get rid of the optical
drive and give me another hour of
battery if you can do it and that would
be past
I really relocating some of this stuff
elsewhere in the system but let's get
into the benchmarks now we're going to
start with the Kulina stuff thermals go
with the noise bridge that talk FPS and
battery as well as always for full
testing methodology check the link the
description below for all that detail in
the article starting with thermals we
ran two games on loop for thermal
testing and real-world scenarios we use
dirt rally and Metro last light both of
which are easy to configure for endless
loop in and are reliable and login they
also produce an upload on the CPU and
the GPU to produce a good amount of
thermal torturing without going to a
full tortured test for the first chart
the Metro last light chart we see CPU
temperature climbs until it hits about
80 Celsius ambient is represented at the
bottom of the chart and we see frequency
is sticking to roughly 30 400 megahertz
for the entire test there are no clock
drops here so no thermal throttling
occurs on the CPU cooling is reasonable
given the small form-factor of the
laptop though the stretch that body does
help spread that heat over a larger area
GPU cooling has us at around 68 to 70
Salty's in this particular test which
shows us dropping about 50 megahertz off
the GPU clocks as time carries on that's
not too bad overall and pretty good
thermal performance when considering the
CPU and GPU are sharing a very small
enclosure and solve the cooling solution
now it does get a bit loud but we'll
talk about that in the next section as
heard dirt rally we see the CPU running
at around 70 to 75 Celsius with the GPU
running at about 65 c so lighter
workload here there's no thermal
throttling on the CPU once again with
the limited clock reductions on the GPU
still present it's more or less confirms
the previous results if you're wondering
what some of the spike enos is in the
frequency charts that's just because the
benchmark loops and whenever it loops
the frequency isn't as in demand moving
into noise this chart shows the fan
curve ramping over time this test was
conducted over about a half hour period
allowing a gaming workload to run on
loop for the full 30 minutes while
plugged in as is shown clearly here
we're seeing the fan curve ramped
quickly into the range of 45 DBA where
idle operations that close to 32 zba of
course this isn't the full picture with
noise the frequency is a bit higher that
we're not currently plotting a
frequency spectrum analysis the noise of
floor is about 26 DB of the room for
reference the laptops fans run loud when
gaming but that won't be a problem if
using headphones it will however be a
bit of a problem trying to use speakers
or the fan ramps up in a more public
setting where you're going to get some
glances for all the wine coming out of
the machine this is something that MSI
is working on with the new max-q laptops
pack from Nvidia where Nvidia is sort of
enforcing a 40 DB a noise output from
the machines guard list for the GE 70 to
7 re in its current form expect about 40
to 45 DBA when gaming and about 32 DBA
one idle which is a bit louder than
desired but not terrible for the primary
battery life test we're looking at
office tasks with all the bloatware
removed and we saw a battery life about
109 minutes when running a PC mark
office on loop until that's of the
battery the tasks included spreadsheet
management a lot of word processing on
some video playback which would be
comparable to YouTube viewing fps
benchmarks were already shown in a
separate video but we'll recap them
briefly here if you want more details go
check out that one and for a summary of
the 1050 TI's results we've got this
charts this is one without comparing to
other laptops we'll recap those in a
moment
generally speaking the 1050 Ti and i7
combination is perfectly adequate for
1080p gaming on a notebook and that's
particularly true considering our
tolerances for FPS are looser with
laptops and desktops the lower power
consumption and form factor receives
greater importance that increased
performance in this type of use case and
we're running at least high settings on
everything and seeing good performance
overall comparatively as we shown this
old mordor benchmark since laptops are
loners and we don't hang on to them
the 1050 Ti outpaces a 970 m sits behind
a 980 m the gtx 1060 is a fairly sizable
upgrade with what is about a 32%
performance uplift but may not be
necessary for everyone we can see this
scale continued fairly linearly in other
games - like our black ops 3 benchmark
1050 Ti lands again between the nine
Sony m10 60 and this one and our
deprecated overwatch training test we
since replace that with batch testing
though detailed in ours
for overwatch graphics optimization
guide and also detailed in our tentative
DTI of benchmark video for laptops
initially being that laptops are so
specific to what you need if you need
something that's a larger screen size
like 17 inches which is really a country
and territory of desktop replacement
though this one's a bit lighter and
smaller than most of those if you need
that screen size it's a fine laptop and
the price is pretty good but generally
speaking this kind of configuration with
an i7 or something like that and a 1050
Ti would be better served in a 15 inch
form factor 15.6 inch form factor where
it's more portable you can actually open
it on a plane this one you really can't
can't I mean if you're on a plane and
you're using the laptop you can end up
with it about this kind of angle on the
screen speaking from experience so
that's kind of problematic with these
larger screen sizes but again it's
something that you trade off if you're
using that as a desktop replacement at
home other kind of smaller points of
notes that may or may not be relevant to
you the keyboard although it is a full
size keyboard with numpad support and
all of that does have function button
requirements in order to use some things
like home or end which are things that I
use frequently when doing editing like
as in written article editing so that's
problematic for me it may not matter for
you if that's the case then ignore the
complaint but otherwise when you have
this much space for a keyboard speaking
personally I'd really like to see those
keys like home and end and some of the
other ones on here expanded out and
actually given a dedicated key on the
keyboard because I have a 14 point
something in the laptop that's from 2012
and it's got a better keyboard than most
laptops on the market today which is why
I haven't upgraded but that's that's
just on the keyboard side software is a
problem if you buy one of these laptops
again the hardware is fine actually the
cool institution is pretty good it
performs really well
under any kind of load where you're
sharing the CPU and GPU and that's all
enclosure but the Psalter is terrible so
you bought if you buy this thing just
remove it all install windows clean and
you have a much better experience out of
box and you're not going to have weird
boot time issues once this has a clean
OS on it it
it's not 18 seconds eighteen point four
or something like that whereas the stock
configuration is closer to 40-plus so
keep that in mind as well but overall
the unit is okay the hardware is good
software not so much let's ignore that
to say blowed away clean OS the
hardware's okay cooling solution is good
one of the better ones on the market it
just comes down to things like how much
do you care about keyboard button
placement and how much do you care about
things like screen size and noise might
be better to look at a smaller screen
size maybe the ge62
where you can cut off about two inches
right here and slightly increase the
chassis height instead might be a better
trade-off for you but overall as always
