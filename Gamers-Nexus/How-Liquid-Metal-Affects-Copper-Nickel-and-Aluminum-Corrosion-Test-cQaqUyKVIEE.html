characteristics of liquid metal trying
to see how much it ages if it dries or
cracks over the period of a year of
testing and now we're looking at how
liquid metal interacts with different
metals that would include it nickel
plated copper like you would most
commonly find in an integrated heat
spreader bare copper like you'd find on
a rocket cool heat spreader or just a
laptop cooler and aluminum conductor not
is what we're using today this is a
eutectic alloy it's a mix of gallium
indium and tin and it's basically gallon
stand but the individual mixtures of
liquid metal have different percentages
for each of the three main elements we
don't know the exact mixture of conduct
or not but we do know that it uses
gallium indium and 10 and can look at
how it interacts with the three main
metals found in the heatsinks before
that this video is brought to you by
NZXT is new h 500 case which we recently
found to have an impressively effective
cooling setup that is entirely negative
pressure when stock the H 500 is the
successor of the s 340 and s 340 a lead
offering high build quality that's all
steel and glass and kael management
features that are also a top class for
the $70 compact mid tower case H 500 is
a part of NZXT Zanu H series lineup
which also features options from mini
ITX micro ATX and full ATX builds learn
more at the link of the description
below testing for this is pretty
straightforward we have three test
subjects today the standard nickel
plated heat spreader like this we
technically we have lap to this one but
we're not testing on this side so these
are what you'd find on an AMD CPU or an
Intel CPU these days this one
specifically comes off of an AMD APU
that's why you see the bump in the
middle but it's still nickel plated
copper and you can prove that by looking
at the other side where we sand it off
the nickel plating to reveal just the
copper so nickel plated coppers
typically what you would interact with
with liquid metal because it sits
between the CPU die the silicon and the
heat spreader not between the heat
spreader and the cooler that's not as
common as you might think if it does sit
between a heat spreader and a cooler
though you'd have a nickel plated
service on one side and then the cooler
is a bit of a question it's either going
to be a just straight copper surface
kind of like this material or it might
be nickel
if it's something like most of Noctua
schoolers for example and then there are
of course aluminum cold plates as well
and we'll talk about this one
specifically in a bit so this is an ASA
taxi I'll see you they don't make this
specific brandt or the version anymore
with the aluminum cold plate
not many coolers do use aluminum cold
blades but if you run into something
that uses aluminum for its cold plate
and not just a nickel plating that looks
aluminum as some people tend to get
tricked by the GPU coolers then it's
problem you don't want to use aluminum
with any kind of liquid metal and every
brand we've worked with free liquid
metal always makes that abundantly clear
not to apply it so it's not like you're
learning anything new but what we wanted
to look at was why not what happens so
that's what we're looking at today let's
start with the worst case scenario to
illustrate how liquid metal behaves with
aluminum we pulled out an old days tech
CLC with an aluminum cold plate then
mounted it to a CPU IHS or integrated
heat spreader with conductor not in
between you are presently looking at the
original aluminum cold plate prior to
using liquid metal so it's clean and new
thermal grisly it warns strongly not to
use liquid metal with aluminum as do
most of their competitors like cool labs
and others and you definitely should
listen to those companies but we wanted
to answer the question of what if if we
add liquid metal you'll see that over a
period of about a night of just sitting
there between the CPU and the cold plate
the liquid metal ends up chalky and
blackened and it embrittle the aluminum
cold plate the cold plate becomes a
weaker and you can start to sort of see
pitting in it and corrosion this is
because aluminum is highly soluble in
gallium and will form an alloy with the
gallium typically aluminum will build an
oxide layer around itself which protects
the aluminum from exposure to other
elements or just air gallium penetrates
the oxide layer that forms around
aluminum and causes the gallium and
aluminum to form an alloy to better
understand this chemical reaction we
asked dear Bauer for an explanation of
how liquid metal interacts with various
other metals there Bauer works with
thermal grisley on product development
and has a background in
electromechanical engineering making him
a subject matter expert for this
question
he said aluminum has an
easy and huge solubility in gallium
which is why gallium forms an alloy with
the aluminum aluminum worked as he
writes it aluminium is a very reactive
metal in general but typically you don't
encounter it because aluminum also
quickly forms an oxide layer which then
protects the aluminum gallium can go
through this oxide layer and then form
an alloy with it which in result makes
the aluminium very Riddle aluminum also
reacts heavily with water for example so
if you have the aluminum dust with no
oxide film and expose it to air it's
extremely explosive the water in the air
will give the o2 atoms to the aluminum
to form aluminium oxide so the result of
the reaction is hydrogen which is then
very explosive since it's an exothermic
reaction that can just blow up fun facts
aside liquid metal is based on gallium
and the indium depending on which
manufacturer you use there will be more
added thermal grisley also adds 10 but I
know that cool laboratory as even more
to the alloy gallium in general also
reacts with the copper and leaves it
pitted on the very top layer but the
reaction is not heavy so it doesn't
really matter to thermal grisley nickel
has the function of a diffusion barrier
and doesn't react with the gallium which
makes it more suitable for the
application and just to be abundantly
clear here the side shoot about
explosives the air power is about
aluminum dust and it's interaction with
o2 so it's not like using liquid metal
is going to cause an explosion in your
machine and using liquid metal on
aluminum cold plates won't cause it to
explode so just to be abundantly clear
there there's not a risk of that it was
just a side shoot that he had to explain
how aluminium interacts with things so
as a note here liquid metal is typically
about 2/3 comprised of gallium it's
about 66 percent depending on the
manufacturer and reducing the gallium
quantity means that there's going to be
a higher percentage of indium and that
means that you reduced the melting point
by doing that imbalance towards indium
ideally liquid metal mixtures minimize
how many different elements are added to
them as an alloy because the thermal
conductivity worsens as a result of more
metals in the alloy and it's also a fine
balance of
detecting the metals involved for the
cold plate the IHS and ensuring that
there's actually good thermal
conductivity so this is an interesting
scenario with these because thermal
conductivity with liquid metal improves
as the temperature increases this is why
for themes like conduct or not they
strongly recommend that you do not use
it for liquid nitrogen overclocking
where you are going to be below a zero
degrees far below it in most cases so
for for those instances thermal paste is
just better but liquid metal will
improve its thermal conductivity with a
higher heat and it will just not work
when it gets to liquid nitrogen sub-zero
temperatures because it loses all of its
thermal conduction performance and there
are other complications involved as well
so if they're all hey it's better for
that moving on this brings us to the
next metal nickel plated copper most
integrated heat spreaders are nickel
plated copper including every heat
spreader currently used on modern Intel
and and the desktop CPUs and HTTP CPUs
there are some heat spreaders sold by
external companies like rocket cool that
are bare copper
although lapping and IHS would also
remove the nickel plated exterior what's
been on screen and is still on screen is
a shot of a nickel plated IHS before
liquid metal application you've all seen
this before any CPU that's new and
packaging or even one that's only ever
been used with drawl paste will look
like this it all wipes off pretty well
and you're left with just a nickel
plated exterior applying liquid metal
between the IHS and the die will result
in a look more like this one on screen
now it's slightly stained but the
staining is largely removable you can
slowly remove more and more of these
stained surface color but ultimately
solve it will permanently remain acetone
and rubbing alcohol can do a lot to
clean off an IHS stand with liquid metal
you can use something like nail polish
remover as an example to really get some
of it off without causing any major
damage there are two things to discuss
here first in our testing the standing
does not impact general performance in
any measurable way it performs in our
testing just as well as it did before
any of the liquid metal standing at all
so this is something that a lot of you
have been concerned about is if you
remove an IHS after using liquid metal
between it and the dye is there a
significant impact to performance once
you have that stained surface on there
the answer
now we've not been able to measure one
and if there is any thermal impact there
probably is it's outside of any scope of
measurement that we have which is going
to be below about a degree Celsius so
you have nothing to worry about in that
instance now secondly here because at
liquid metal is typically about
two-thirds gallium the compound is more
tenable to use with nickel and nickel
plated coolers than it would be
otherwise as we noted earlier the
gallium mixture is heavier and tends to
work a bit better that way with nickel
then if you went heavier on the indium
side so using more gallium can reduce
the will reduce the potential for ion
migration and this is what you'll see
when mixing copper in various oxidation
states with the liquid metal alloys as
opposed to nickel plated copper so it's
a different response there and nickel
plated the heat spreaders are completely
fine to use the liquid metal you don't
have to worry about it at all if you've
had concerns about it don't just drop
them because the only real concern is
once you start looking at bare copper
which we'll get to momentarily or
definitely aluminum as you saw that's a
pretty bad reaction so it's completely
cosmetic on nickel-plated heat spreaders
we have never been able to measure a
performance Delta even with a stand raw
copper IHS by the way which is what we
can talk about next finally we can move
on to the Rocket cool raw copper heat
spreaders in this instance there is more
electro mechanical potential for
galvanic corrosion with liquid metal
than in the nickel plated example
depending on the mixture of liquid metal
this use case will display different
results we use to conduct or not as
stated earlier we have some before shots
of the rocky coal I adjust that we can
show we've worked with a few of them now
it's clean new copper and very shiny
applying liquid metal will result in
heavy staining this is similar to what
we saw with nickel but much more extreme
and effectively impossible to remove
even with a lot of acetone even if you
soak it in acetone that's because we're
starting to see ion migration into the
copper with some of the liquid metal
permanently plating the copper gallium
has a negative potential and copper has
a positive potential or voltage which
will cause the gallium to migrate and
plate the copper over time so in terms
of answering the question what can and
can't you use liquid metal with safely
well keep it in mind all the other
considerations of
could metal like the fact that it is
electrically conductive so if you're not
careful with it in something like a
laptop you could short something and
damage it or destroy it keeping those in
mind strictly from a chemical standpoint
definitely never use it with aluminum
but that's made abundantly clear in the
packaging normally and we only worked
with conductor not here but they're all
gallon stand compounds and some of them
have a bit more gallium somehow more
indium some might not even have 10 so
depending on what you're working with
the reaction or the extremity the how
how bad it is in this regard will change
but for conduct or not that's what we
end up with and with any of these liquid
metal compounds even if it's a different
composition just don't use it with
aluminum pretty straightforward there
with nickel-plated heat spreaders like
this one the underside of this one or
the top of basically every heat spreader
on the market currently you have nothing
to worry about it will stain it so if
you put it on the top of the heat
spreader you might not be able to see
the word Intel or AMD anymore when you
clean it off it'll be somewhat stained
and most of that's removable you can get
it off with acetone if you're really
worried about it but some of it will
probably stay there somewhat permanently
especially as it goes through more aging
and thermal cycles and things like that
but don't worry about it from a
performance standpoint and from a
chemical standpoint it's fine
at least with conducting ah and with
cool labs and I think we've tested two
or three other liquid metals as well but
they're all pretty much fine with copper
and this is something you would find in
a laptop that a lot of you have asked
about like if you have direct contact
between the silicon die and the copper
cold plate for the laptop cooler you'll
get some pitting there on the surface
potentially and you'll definitely get
staining like this but this heat
spreader and we've tested this a few
times now with different different
versions of this rocket cool heat
spreader it works every bit as well as
it did when we first got it it was brand
new so it stains it doesn't look as good
but the performance is still there it's
not not a use case either by the way
that these companies recommend against
it's only alloy or aluminum that they
recommend strongly against so the nickel
plated definitely fine aluminum
definitely bad copper
for the most part is fine but the
mixture may influence how much it stains
or pits and we only tested conducted on
here today so that's it for this one
