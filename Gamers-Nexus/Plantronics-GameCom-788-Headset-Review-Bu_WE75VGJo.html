Nexus dotnet and I am kind of sick right
now so you're gonna have to deal with my
voice as it were we are reviewing the
Plantronics new game comm 788 headset
today this is a refresher on their 780
headset which I've been recommending for
a couple years now and not much has
changed which is really that's okay it
doesn't have to change if it works and
the 780 I've been recommending as one of
the best value headsets
in the $60 range for the last few years
you can almost always find it fifty to
eighty dollars tends to be lower and the
788 and 780 have identical
specifications beyond a few things and
those few things include the colors
which don't really impact performance
too much so colors have changed a little
bit it's using more orange on the seven
eighty eight whereas the 780 was a bit
more of a dark red
they changed the driver support so the 7
88 introduced Windows 8 and 8.1 driver
support officially this was adopted by
all other modern Plantronics products as
well so the 780 should also be
compatible with Windows 8 at this point
and 8.1 and that's all they're all
that's changed so if you already have a
780 and it works well I would say just
before we even talk about audio quality
you don't need to get the 788 if you
don't yet have the 780 and you need a
headset of some kind
my recommendation going forward is going
to shift to the 788 as it is the
refresher and let's run through the
audio specs really quickly the 780 and
788 chip with a 20 Hertz to 20 kilohertz
speaker driver frequency response which
is pretty standard really and the driver
size is 40 millimeters again not not too
off the path that's fairly standard a
couple higher-end headsets will do 50
millimeters though the microphone
frequency response is 100 Hertz day out
of 8 rather kilohertz not 800 Gillard's
that would be that would be like husky
Starcraft levels of high voice 100 Hertz
10 kilohertz on the mic 6.5 feet on the
cable length uses USB and
of course does not use a sound card as a
result it has its own processing going
on and is compatible with Windows and
Mac it's got a one-year service warranty
pretty standard stuff really there are a
couple buttons on the earpiece you can
control the mic mute and unmute the
volume and then you can also press a
button that enables Dobey digital
headphone technologies and the the
drivers themselves there are only two
drivers and then they simulate 7.1
channels using digital means which is
pretty standard these days in the
headset so it's not true quote-unquote
7.1 audio but it's pretty damn close and
games that support it the dhobi
technology that I mentioned can actually
it does a few things so what it really
tries to do is make the sound more rich
and it does that by sort of surrounding
your head and audio it almost feels like
sound is coming from all sides rather
than just the earphones are just sort of
an interesting experience it kind of
resembles an auditorium in that way but
there are a couple downsides to this and
all and there are a few upsides as well
it just kind of depends on the user the
the downsides you lose a lot of the
highs in music I found that cymbals were
kind of lost the higher cymbals
Alexisonfire uses a lot of these in
their music you kind of lose some of
that vocals if there's any like
post-hardcore screaming type of stuff
you're going to lose some of the higher
grittiness and it's it's kind of brought
down a level in terms of tone and that's
just because of how the dhobi technology
is making everything sound like it
resonates more with in the headphones
rather than just hit your ear directly
so again sort of an idiosyncratic thing
but it can sound cool for explosions and
big boomy bassy things I like that a lot
unfortunately it's really not usable at
all for a competitive gaming that that
makes use of a directional audio and
counter-strike go it's going to get you
murdered if you use that Dolby sound but
that's okay because you can disable it
and the reason it'll get you murdered is
because it actually will take the sound
and sort of equalize the channels so if
you've got sound that's supposed to only
come in through the right channel or the
right year excuse me
the right year having this technology
enabled we'll send it to both ears and
then you don't know if the guys on your
right or your left or above you or
whatever if you disable it the headset
does use as I said 7.1 digital
simulation of surround so you can
actually pinpoint sort of left right up
down diagonally up down back forward
it's very cool it works better in games
like Battlefield that fully support this
type of audio a lot of games don't do
more than 5.1 very well counter-strike
included but if you're playing something
like Battlefield it's great for that
you're playing something like Skyrim you
can get kind of a more immersive
experience in this regard especially if
you do want to try dialing with Adobe
technology because Skyrim isn't really
as dependent upon directional audio so
that's sort of how I feel about the
headset it's it's fairly comfortable it
is very tight when you first get it but
that just means that it's going to
loosen up as use it give it about a week
I found that's all it took for mine to
loosen up and no longer apply pressure
anywhere your the earphones are Square
and don't touch my ears almost at all
and that's a good thing because there's
no awkward pressure or anything like
that going on while you're using it so
everything fits pretty well it's fairly
comfortable produces an immersive
experience and has good directional
audio I would recommend playing around
with Dolby Surround seeing what you
think of it my personal choice is to
leave it disabled because I don't like
it but it's up to you so that's the
