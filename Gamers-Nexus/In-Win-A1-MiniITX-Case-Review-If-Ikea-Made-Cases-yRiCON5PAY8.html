cases to feature a wood finish which
seems like it be the new in thing to do
for twenty eighteen that fat faded as
the wood panels are apparently a lot
more involved in manufacturing than
anyone expected it'll happen eventually
but for now anyone is pushing the normal
version of its a1 Mini ITX Mini tower
meant for use as an HT PC box with IKEA
influenced design if its marketing
language is anything to go by which says
something about being Scandinavian and
plain in other words IKEA today we're
reviewing the inn when a one for build
quality layout and thermals before that
this video is brought to you by NZXT is
new h 500 case which we recently found
to have an impressively effective
cooling setup that is entirely negative
pressure when stock the h 500 is the
successor of the s 340 and s 340 a LEED
offering high build quality that's all
steel and glass and kale management
features that are also a top class for
the $70 compact mid tower case H 500 is
a part of NZXT Zanu H Series lineup
which also features options from mini
ITX micro ATX and full ATX builds learn
more at the link in the description
below
we've showed the a1 a few times at this
point originally it did have that wood
finish on the top or the front or
something like that and it's probably
still going to happen but n when
basically said that the manufacturing
process for the wood paneling is very
difficult and expensive because it's
time consuming on the machines so for
now they have this version with an
acrylic top and the case is overall
interesting it's a cube format case not
too different from the Thermaltake v1 we
looked at previously or the Silverstone
SG 13 for example the interesting things
here couple small features like just
having two buttons on the side panel are
really nice surprisingly nice actually
in a world where people are using Allen
heads and flat heads and all kinds of
different screws for no apparent reason
to get the glass panels on and off and
winds just gone with clips and buttons
because I guess it doesn't weigh that
much so why not otherwise the case
itself once you get the panel off you
see that inside it does have an included
power supply and this is where things
get a little bit annoying with the case
so the
one has a fine form-factor it's it's
really nothing to complain about it's
again some way to the SG 13 which is
okay it's not a smallest case in the
world but it's pretty damn small you can
put it in a living room and it'll hide
out of the way with this one though
rather than being something like a 70 or
80 dollar case which is about what it
looks like it includes zero fans that's
okay you can buy them and yet it's $170
or so and the reason it's $170 is
largely because it includes a power
supply so includes a 600 watt power
supply by power man
of course one of the best-known
manufacturers in the world I think it's
an f SP unit basically so it's a Power
Man six hundred power supply that you
probably didn't ask for and it has a
semi proprietary shield on this side so
it's like a power supply shroud almost
except not exactly and then the power
supply also has coming out of it a USB
connector you could run your own if you
preferred but the USB connector goes
into a Qi charger on the top but you
probably also didn't ask for but it is
there and the power supply basically
plugs straight into the Qi charger the
reason they do this they say is because
the Qi charger can then be used you know
when the systems off so the power supply
still provides five volts or whatever it
is standby to the Qi charger so you can
still charge your devices while the
system is not activated that's what they
say is the reason for including a power
supply more realistically it's probably
because if you want to actually install
a remove a power supply it's kind of a
pain it's not the worst part of a build
that we've ever seen but in this one you
do have to remove the front or top i/o
in this instance in order to get access
to the screws to put power supply in the
case again not the worst thing it's
certainly something that everyone
watching this channel is capable of but
it's just one of those small annoying
things that you have to deal with with
an ITX case that has limited space
available to it so anyway at 170 bucks
it's a hard sell even before we get to
the review we're not even there yet and
it's already tough to sell because there
are really good cases in this form
factor for under $100 and I have a hard
time believing a 600 watt 80 plus bronze
power supply is worth a hundred bucks so
you're paying a lot for power supply and
for a Qi charger and no fans and then a
bunch of acrylic basically in when
though of course is no foreigner to high
costs cases it's kind of the thing they
do it's what they specialize in so those
are the basics we'll go through
Patrick's build notes here and then get
into thermal and acoustic discussion as
well and see if this thing's actually
worth buying the a1 is a small and
uncomplicated case which is good because
there's no physical manual just a card
with a QR code on it the power supply is
pre-installed so a big portion of the
build is taken care of before the case
is even out of the box as we pointed out
at CES the advantages of including the
power supply are ease of installation
and avoiding compatibility issues with
larger power supplies the downside is
that the case is built with one specific
power supply in mind and it's not
intended to be swapped out we use an SFX
power supply for mini ITX case testing
and to install it we have to get rid of
the plastic shield they call it a top
PSU chamber and that's placed between
the power supply and the glass panel
modular power supplies like ours may be
more difficult to fit than on modular
since the case isn't tailored to that
arrangement of cables like the
Silverstone SG 13 that we reviewed
recently cable management boils down to
bundling cables together and hoping they
don't touch a fan blade which is another
reason to stick with the pre tidied up
power supply that n1 provides the other
reason after that is because you paid a
lot of money for it the bottom line is
that the power supply is definitely
factored into the overall cost so don't
buy this case with the intention of
replacing the power supply it's 600
Watts 80 plus bronze and non modular and
if any of that is a deal-breaker don't
buy the case simple the steel panel on
the side is held with captive thumb
screws at the top and plastic tabs at
the bottom and in one feature that we've
appreciated in the past the glass side
panel uses two extremely easy to use
plastic snaps at the top it's a bit
overkill for a panel that's only a foot
wide but it's a great idea and we hope
anyone makes use of this on some
full-size cases in the future the Qi
charger is powered via micro USB cable
as indicated previously and a stock
power supply has a dedicated cable for
this purpose if the stock power supply
is used the charger remains active at
all times the bigger problem that we had
with the charger though is that here's
the thing this is supposed to be a small
form factor PC so it's probably going
next to a TV or something like that
you're maybe sitting six to ten feet
away from it on a couch if it's being
used as intended and as an inland zone
really marketing discussion so then why
would you want a Qi charger ten feet
away you might as well plug it into a
cable at that point because ultimately
the idea I think of Qi chargers as
someone who doesn't use them is that
generally you keep it kind of next to
where you're sitting and you get a taxed
and you can pick it up on tethered and
reply and put it back down on the
charger but at 10 feet away what's the
point kind of loses all of it
so maybe that's okay for some of you if
it is great I guess you could buy the
case without any issues but otherwise it
just it seems like an oddly positioned
feature for a case that's not really
meant to be next to the user when it's
in use and further the Qi charger itself
is underneath a giant sheet of acrylic
so whenever you're pushing any kind of
inductive charging through an interface
or through some obstructing material
you're dealing with slower charging
because less current ultimately getting
to the device on the other side of it
and even on mouse pads with Qi chargers
like the Corsair one you can really only
lift the thing up like a millimeter or
two before it's just not charging
anymore or not charging adequately so on
this there will be a ultimately lower
current that is going to that where the
charger is where your phone is sitting
to charge your phone so it's not going
to charge that fast so it's a slower
charging Qi charger as a result of the
extra thickness that the current has to
travel through and it's also just kind
of odd to be on a case that's going to
be sitting 6 or 10 feet away from you so
the a wand again doesn't come with any
fans and then when other cases like the
303 don't either so it's possible to run
the case with no fans it's just not a
great idea you should probably buy some
we had to choose some kind of stock
fantastic configuration to go with this
because just testing it without any
would incinerate everything so no real
point in that because ultimately you
shouldn't be using it that way so all
fan slots are 120 millimeters there are
two in the bottom there's one in that
side panel and then there's one in the
rear slot as well so we have a couple of
things we did for thermal testing
and a lot of it was just trying to
figure out what made the most sense
because it is a blank slate for you to
work with so everyone knows a case will
get hot without fans you don't need to
prove that point we added the NZXT air F
125 doubt of the H 400 KS from NZXT and
the stock configuration so-called that
we settled on was it with one exhaust
fan in the rear and then one intake fan
in the front bottom and our GPU is a
short card which we'll talk about later
because that comes into play as well we
also tested some other configurations so
we tested two bottom intake and one rear
exhaust we tested one side intake and
one we were exhaust and then we tested
again the stock configuration except
with the case flipped on the front like
that and the reason for that is because
the side skirts here have such little
gaps in them that we were curious
whether or not they were impeding
airflow in any meaningful way because
you've got the fan cage sticking down
out of the bottom and then you have a
dust filter which is actually fairly
fine it's got more holes than it does
not holes so that's always a good thing
and then the side skirt extends down
pretty low as well so that's potentially
an area of impedance and something we
want to test by simply flipping the case
just like this because then you no
longer have that impedance so let's get
into the thermal numbers start with the
CPU torture testing cv comparatives and
then go on through the rest a verge of
CPU temperature with the configuration
we chose this baseline bottom in rear
out was 62.1 degrees Celsius over
ambient and then we retested it later as
61.5 degrees in the second test so
basically the same thing with in error
flipping the case onto its face help the
intake fan supply more air to the CPU
lower in time 457 degrees delta T over
ambient adding another fan into the
bottom directly under the GPU lowered
the temperature for the CPU by a couple
degrees from baseline and this brought
us down to 59 point four degrees Celsius
and understandably small change because
of the obstruction using a side intake
rather than a bottom intake fell right
between the two baseline tests at sixty
one point seven degrees delta T over
ambient so there's no significant
difference comparatively for the CPU
temperatures against other cases Stevan
temperatures are decent but unimpressive
baseline temperatures were most similar
to the SG 13 with the front filter
removed
which is also fairly close to the form
factor of the a one cubes style many ITX
cases tend to have clearance for CBD
tower coolers like the one sixty
millimeter clearance in the a one so our
low-profile cryo you see seven doesn't
take full advantage of the space
provided this is the nature of testing
ITX might as well use a bigger cooler
for this one but you got the idea and
we're trying to standardize four
components anyway at present our results
put us at around the age 200 i with
front intake and the FG thirteen without
a filter GP a-- testing was more
unpredictable face line was forty one
point one degrees aziz over ambient and
forty point two and retested just within
our one c margin of errors so i didn't
take supplied less air to the GPU and
averaged forty three point nine degrees
dt and the GPU we used from any ID axis
testing is a short single fan design so
with the bottom intake fan towards the
front of the case and away from the GPU
and our baseline tests we didn't expect
the GPU to get much air flow logically
the two bottom intake fan configuration
should have done better since one of the
fans pointed directly into the GPU
cooler however that test averaged five
degrees above baseline forty five point
three CDT and the face down tests that
allowed the bottom intake fan to pull
more air in also averaged above baseline
our working theory is that with two fans
one obstructed intake and one
unobstructed exhaust the case was under
negative pressure and pulled air in a
way that benefited the GPU more than
other configurations
moving on to comparative testing for the
GPU despite the bottom and take fans
being nearly flush with the desk
underneath the a1 has the lowest average
GPU DTA on our chart below even the RV's
eo3
with the optimal fan placement this is
of course thanks to the NZXT fans that
we stuck into it they're really taking
all the credit here so it's indicative
to some point of good air flow and
pressure patterns but also the fans do
matter the age 200 comes with identical
fans however and the a1 was still
several degrees cooler than it most of
this advantages because that the path of
the components is so short you know the
fans nearly flush against the table the
airflow path is only inches to get to
the components so static pressure is
less relevant than in a case with
impeding filters and eight inch travel
distances to the components firestrike
GPU temperatures average forty point
seven degrees dt over ambiens equivalent
to the torture test and that's again
better than the h 200 which uses the
same fan
Stevi temperatures recorded in a1 are
surprising but the remains consistently
good in every test we ran CPU testing
for blender now is next
so CPU rendering average forty four
point five degrees D T on the CPU
between the h200 NZXT KS and cores are
280 X and again in the middle of the
pack GPU rendering average 24 point nine
degrees on the GPU being the previous
best of thirty point seven for the h200
we only used the stock or baseline
configuration when testing and blender
and fire strike so the rv0 three is
optimum fan configuration isn't on this
chart check the previous review for that
ultimately then for this case what we'd
like to see is a bare-bones version of
it there is no reason this case should
force you to buy a honestly pretty low
end power supply with it that's a
comparison
are the longest-living component for the
most part in an entire computer it's the
thing that's the easiest to reuse it's
also sort of a specific thing if you
have cable needs or any other things
that you're considering in terms of
airflow patterns and you want to pass a
power supply because it's an ITX box
whatever it doesn't matter the point is
at $170 for this case a lot of it
probably being the power supply because
they're ordering low quantities so they
can't beat Corsair EVGA for pricing it's
it's hard to recommend it
170 bucks is way too much what this is
we do like the case thermals are fine
they actually do better than we expected
the build quality is good the I mean if
you like the IKEA minimalist look I
guess that works too that's the thing
you want you can get it in this case so
there's really nothing incredibly wrong
with it other than the price and that's
a weird place to be because we can
recommend the case the case is perfectly
fine and we actually like it overall but
a 170 bucks way too much so what we'd
like to see in win if you're listening
is remove the Qi charger remove the
power supply remove the power spike
cover thing and see what that lets you
get down to in price maybe 110 bucks or
something like that but that would
probably be where we'd want to see it
ultimately is that 70 to 110 dollar
range with a difference just depending
on other features like do you decide to
include more fans by which I mean more
than zero because that would be a good
move as well
all this money spent on the power supply
Qi charger would be better spent on
maybe one fan reduced the price the case
and let the user figure out the rest
that's kind of the whole point a PC
building anyway so it's just it's weird
to sell it in this setup because it's
it's not that competitive you could
piece out the parts for lower cost than
anyone is selling them to you for and
part of that is ultimately again going
to be because in when is ordering a semi
custom power supply in definitely low
quantities and they're never gonna beat
the price that you can get buying one
from someone like UGA coarser solder
stoner people who make power supplies on
mass and get volume discounts as a
result of it which are passed on to the
consumer so that's the problem with the
case the case itself is fine it's just
the pricing is no good so anyway as
