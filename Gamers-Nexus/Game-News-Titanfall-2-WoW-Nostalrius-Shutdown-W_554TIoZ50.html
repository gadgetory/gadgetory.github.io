sequel to the game that no one remembers
EA confirmed titanfall 2 with a release
trailer this week a teaser trailer as it
were announcing at the same time that
the game would be on display in some
form at their play event during e3 ea's
play event starts on june twelfth and
was set up because the company is
skipping III so far no other details
have come out about the game that are
noteworthy but you can expect to hear
more about it in June some sad news for
many World of Warcraft fans this week
the popular private server no status was
shut down on April 10th this comes from
a cease and desist issued by Blizzard
Entertainment the Nostalgia server has
allowed players to keep playing vanilla
wow as it was 13 years ago pre expansion
and is somewhat similar to project 99
forever quest before being shut down to
salaries had over a hundred and fifty
thousand active players to signify the
ending of their server players got
together to travel from the orc capital
orgrimmar to the Thunder Bluff cliffs
where they jumped to their deaths in
addition many attempted the stream the
server's final moments but in another
spit to the face the private server
violated twitch TVs Terms of Service and
so the streams were shut down one of the
10,000 upcoming character based team
battle arena first person shooter RPGs
battle born entered open beta this week
until April eighteenth players can hop
on and try out the game for free before
2k had said that nothing unlocked and
this beta would carry over to the full
release of the game and for the most
part that still stands but players in
the beta can collect very large numbers
of quote-unquote shards and redeem those
massive numbers of shards those who
collect enough shards can unlock gold
skins whatever those may be and there's
will be available in the full game once
it releases so whether or not the beta
wipes everything those will remain
stardew valley was also in the news this
week the indie farming RPG hit over a
million sales since it was released two
months ago according to publisher
chucklefish games this also puts stardew
valley under arc and h1z1 in steam sales
for 2016 for those not aware stardew
valley is a harvest moon style RPG
players control a young man who
here it's a farm from a grandfather and
like Harvest Moon you expected to do all
the things about a farm in which to turn
a profit we're not yet sure how the game
it deals with corn subsidies though so
that is all for this week check out the
patreon link the postal video to help us
out directly and let us know if you
found any of the city's interesting
thank you for watching I'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
