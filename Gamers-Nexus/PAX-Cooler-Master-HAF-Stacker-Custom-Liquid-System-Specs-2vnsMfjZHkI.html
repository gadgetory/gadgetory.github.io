nexus donna and once again we were
looking at the cooler master half
stacker in the link in the description
below you'll see our full rundown of the
case now we're talking about this the
actual system specs inside of the case
here at PAX Prime at 2013 so here we
have 26 90 s from Nvidia of course they
have cool ants cooling blocks attached
them and that runs down to a 360
radiator in the bottom and in the top
because it is a freaking massive case so
you can actually fit 2 360's and if you
want it to you can even fit a mini ITX
system in the top and just have two
systems in one case because why not it'd
be cool if you're like a media
production professional or something
like that in terms of other specs we've
got a maximus 6 extreme motherboard from
asus rog and a 4770k intel cpu i7 cpu of
course the Rams back I'm not sure about
it looks like we've got two sticks of
Kingston maybe Genesis probably 1866
megahertz memory and then over here for
the drives we actually have 24 terabyte
black drives and for one terabyte Raptor
drives which are 10k RPM down here we
have two SSDs until 240 gigabyte intel
SSD 520 series drives and then again
it's got I think 15 or 17 fans something
insane like that you could actually put
a side panel on here with yet another
fan 200 millimeters and that's pretty
much the whole case if you want to know
more about the half stacker check the
link below for the the video that runs
through the cases specs and we have that
with Nate from cooler master who is the
official product champion and that's all
for this video so check out the link in
the description below check out the
article and we'll see you guys next time
