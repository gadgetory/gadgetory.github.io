the 7950 GX - there's a dual GPU card
I asked EVGA to bring us something cool
to work with this is what they came up
with so we should already have coverage
up of the DG 77 case and that's actually
new this however is not it's from 2006
it's a dual GPU card but unlike the dual
GPU cards that most are used to from you
at recent years this one has two PCBs
on each of which is a separate set of
memory separate vrm and a separate GPU
so that's what we're going to be doing
today we are tearing down the 7950 GX 2
dual GPU card from 2006 to see how it
looks inside before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by a thermal
take and their new core p3 chassis it's
an open-air chassis that can double as a
test bench or it can be wall mounted and
you can learn more at the link of the
description below so this card is a like
I said it's got two GPUs on it in
between there's actually an SLI bridge
and we talked about this on EVGA stream
so if you already saw their stream then
you know most of this stuff but I'm
gonna redo it all here for you
so in between is the bridge and there's
a bridge chip in there which this card
is before my time as reviewers so I am
not too familiar with its specs or
performance at the time we can take it
apart that's not outside of my abilities
so we'll take this off it's got a couple
of basically just these black sets of
screws on either side to hold it all
together and then on the opposite
back of the PCB is the chrome door just
normal screw steel screws that hold the
cooler on so the cooler has got two
small blower fans I'm not sure what the
exact sizes they look kind of like 40s
maybe 60s but I think they are closer to
40 I'm gonna have to
get in here okay there we go that's the
first piece free now there is a couple
more of these they're held on here and
here and also it's a 6-pin connector
single one dual GPU it supports sli so
you actually works a slide there's that
sly finger right there so you do SLI
with this which means you can do
four-way SLI and it's not new to do for
we SLI with two cards but this is two
cards with four PCBs in that instance so
that's kind of interesting in terms of
the rest we have I think it's a 1
gigabyte memory capacity so I think
we're at
I think remember how many memory modules
it was we'll see once we get in there
but I think this was the era of gddr3
this is well before any HBM discussion
even came up in the public especially
2006 era product it did not live very
long that's got killed by another dual
GPU card that I think came out with the
8000 series and effectively put the nail
on the coffin for this one now this is
despite being branded as EVGA it is a
reference design from Nvidia so this is
how they shipped for basically all of
them and EVGA just happened to still
have one in their warehouse they've a
lot of actually a lot a hole to cool
stuff there but if we take this last
couple pegs I will be able to see the
card
okay looking good I think it just
separates now so you can see the sli
bridge in there we're just gonna pull
and it should separate there you go
there's the SLI bridge component there's
a bridge chip underneath I don't know if
it's under each of them or just under
one we'll look though and also just from
a TDP perspective I think this was a 146
what I want to say part so if you put
that into perspective day this is what
was it like 76 gigabytes of memory
bandwidth per second on this card you
have modern cards doing well over 300 in
some cases and and then for I this was
before single CUDA cores were really a
thing they were doing vertex and I think
pixel pipelines was the other one vertex
and pixel pipelines vertex shaders that
is so
older Arab but the point is that 146 was
you look at the performance then what
that gave you a versus the frogs now
we're like what is it a 10 60 maybe is
around that area a 480 is not too
distant so you consider the technology
today and when this came out it's pretty
big job especially because this video
card I believe was six hundred and fifty
dollars when it launched video cards
effectively so 615 you can still get
them for around 60 bucks on the eBay but
yeah there's the GPU we already rubbed
that there won't pay stop earlier and
the die actually says the dye cover says
G 71 I don't remember which architecture
this is you could I'll look it up and
maybe leave a comment below
but G 71 was the GPU very small GPU
comparatively and so you don't need a
huge cooling solution and also I think
the 146 Watts may have been for the
entire card not for just one so that's
the case you're looking at saudi watts
per GPU if that's the case I'd have to
look it up and we're at a trade show so
small cold plate here aluminum zinc
aluminum separate bridges to connect
through the thermal pad and to the B Ram
modules so there are eight of these per
card and it's a one gigabyte total
capacity on the whole card so that's 512
and the other ones gonna have 512 as
well and then for the power components
it's a delta inductor setup and then
front side there's the bridge chip
there's a sli bridge you can actually
pull that out if you wanna have you want
to do a mod on this like i mean if i
were reviewing this today if it were a
new card i'd love to pull it apart put a
different sli connector in there like a
ribbon cable and then you just put a big
cooler on each one and see what I can do
for overclocking and this card
this is the same so it's it's identical
under there there's no point taking it
apart the cooler is all the same you can
see it's a pretty pedestrian cooler by
today's standards the aluminum fins in
there are not that dense there's not a
lot of mass but I guess it worked for
the time I'm not really sure we didn't
review on there's a tiny fan though and
that's it that's the 7950 gx2 as always
