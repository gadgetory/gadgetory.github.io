CyberPower and I rep our interest you as
a DIY builder this review should have
some pretty interesting data for you we
did extensive thermal analysis on this
small form-factor enclosure you can see
the GPU is pretty tight in there but
it's got a ventilation port and it's
using a blower fan so interesting test
to look at so we have extensive data
that may be interesting whether or not
you're gonna buy one of these things now
this is an Origin Chronos I think it's
the VR edition though they also have an
on VR edition and it's basically it's a
small form-factor box I think this is a
custom case I do not know who the OEM is
but I couldn't find it on new egg so it
is a custom case it is similar in some
ways to IO power revolt to the power
three volts who they made and that's
only because it's also a small
form-factor box they've each got their
own kind of flair this one has red LEDs
around the window whatever it's just
it's a box right but it's a small box so
that makes thermals pretty interesting
with this thing I think this is a $2,300
23.92 dollar units counting the LEDs the
GTX 1080 the i7 6700 K and a few other
components and we'll do a price analysis
later before getting to our call audits
where I audit the tech support and the
sales teams posing as an incompetent
customer let's talk about thermals then
we'll go to noise power fps and all that
other stuff and see if this thing's
actually any good even if you're a DIY
builder so thermals first these numbers
are presented as a delta T value that
means we subtract out the ambient
temperature we have a video on this that
you can check on the channel was posted
just before this one add in your local
temperature to get me full temperature
value the Chronos runs pretty hot the
result of a small form-factor box with
overclocked components is that it will
run hot and this one hits 74.6 delta T
over ambient that's in Celsius for the
CPU cores and that means we're regularly
hitting 100 C on a few of the CPU cores
if you factor in ambient and that causes
the CPU to throttle back upon hitting
t.j.maxx the same issue happens with the
GT X 1080 efi which is hitting 60 2.58
Celsius peak average and that's in the
range of
90 91 Celsius when accounting for
ambience and an open-air bench without
the inherent restrictions of an ITX box
we saw peak temperatures around 80 to C
with a throttle point for the GT X 1080
Fe at that temperature just maintaining
these temperatures of seventy four point
six C delta T for the CPU and the sixty
two point five eight C for the GPU just
maintaining those requires the vrm fan
to run it a hundred percent
and we Auto configure the GPU fans a
fifty five percent for some tests which
are shown on the screen now and the
reason I did that is to get a direct
apples-to-apples comparison of how well
this box performs without the window
versus with the window and so we
actually see a somewhat different
performance output we're getting about 5
Celsius better when removing the acrylic
window which creates somewhat of a
basically a diathermic wall I guess is
one way to say it and our suggestion to
origin based on this data would be to
just drill a few holes in this thing
they don't it doesn't even have to be a
mesh just a couple of small holes well
look quite as pretty but if you get a
couple degrees out of it that's actually
a big deal and I'll tell you why for our
short-term tests the GPU spikes in
frequency erratically over the test
period as a result of thermal
fluctuations this means that the 1080 is
functioning as designed and it's using
boost 3.0 to bounce the clock rate as a
means to reduce or control temperature
and we'll use cross bars to highlight
these spikes note that around the 600
second mark the temperature is hitting a
range of 90 Celsius for the non Delta
value or about 65 C Delta and compare
that to harsh sudden drops of frequency
where we fall to nearly 1600 megahertz
we see that the temperature spike lines
up with the frequency spike and the
reduced clock is the only way the GPU
can stay within its spec this results in
heavy impact of framerate at times and
as the clock rate was initially 1960 to
2000 megahertz it over the course of
testing fell to 1600 megahertz and we do
see that reflected in frame rates and
sometimes frame times during the spikes
but this can be partially resolved we
ran a two hour endurance
using a different game Metro last light
to see how it responds to 1440p with
complete max settings in Metro last
light and it's a little bit less
intensive on the clock right not quite
as clock biased and the test was
conducted with the pre-configured
overclock and auto fan speed settings in
this test the first chart shows GPU
temperature versus frequency was time
notice that the frequency is more stable
here than in the previous test that we
showed we still can't maintain the 2009
Hertz clock rate but we're able to sit
at about 1900 megahertz and the
temperature is represented as a non
Delta value this time so what you're
seeing is the actual GPU diode
temperature with ambient added we're at
90 C here and the only way to achieve
the thermal and oscillation clock
oscillation stability is to allow the
fan to auto boost up to a hundred
percent speed or 4,000 rpm that
obviously impacts noise so let's look at
the noise data next this chart shows our
noise testing we subtract out ambient
noise floor by using a logarithmic
formula for computing the Delta is
between decibel values as they can't be
simply subtracted for reference the gtx
1080 fe on our open-air bench is present
origins Chronos runs at a pretty steady
hum with its idle noise level at about
52 point nine DB use in the
pre-configured by a smart fan and auto
GPU fan settings for comparison the open
air test bench with a 1080 fe idles
about 37 point 5 DB but that is using an
x 41 CL c and a hale 90 PSU these are
the only fans in that test system so
they're a good deal quieter than
something like an ITX box a better
comparison of course would be ITX builds
from other s eyes but we only just
recently added EB testing so I didn't do
it back when we had the revolt 2 because
we didn't have DB testing methodology in
place yet origins hitting about 58 DB
under 100 percent rpm which is only
slightly louder than the open air 1080
at 100% fan rpm the two are more or less
the same to the listener but the big
point here is that the 1080 Fe will
basically never hit a hundred-percent
fan speeds when in an
Venera bench or in a sort of full tower
case the only reason it will go that
high is if it can't sit steady at 82 Sal
zis with a 50 ish percent fan speed this
case it can't do that obviously so it's
pushing pretty hard up to 100 rpm which
is 4,000 and then it's able to keep its
90 Celsius temperature a bit better so
it's a fairly loud idle noise level the
GPU fan does regulate itself idle at
1100 rpm by the CPU fans pushing 2,000
it's one of those slim fans on basically
a liquid cooler it's a 120 millimeter
liquid cooler so it's it's a little bit
noisy idle but the full load temperature
is what you would expect
it's just ideally you don't hit 100% rpm
with the GPU found or full load so let's
talk about power next the system we have
has a 450 watt SFX PSU from Corsair it's
actually good power supply and it does
sound a bit crazy on the surface to put
a 450 watt PSU with basically a flagship
card like a 1080 but that's where the
world is now with TDP so technically
Nvidia recommends a 500 watt power
supply it's a bit of a safe
recommendation unless you are putting
the system under a trance code 100%
workload for the GPU and a 100% may be
the large Fourier transforms on the CPU
unless you're doing that simultaneously
this 450 watt power supply availability
is not going to be an issue and that's
not really a use case you would have for
almost any system anyway so the 450
watts is plenty when we did the testing
I saw a power draw of 282 time 9 watts
for a full system power when running 3d
mark fires like ultra at 4k looping
using the combined test to hit both the
CPU and the GPU pretty heavily so that's
fully with an acceptable range it's a
bit over the 50% power draw mark that's
fine this power supply is not gonna be
threatened it'll still live a long and
good life so I will commend origin
I'm not going to overkill with the power
supply this is something a lot of the
essays really fail with they'll send us
I think I'm empowered did this in the
past and I think cyber power has as well
they'll send us a system with us
100 watery hundred watt power spine it's
totally unnecessary
and it just pushes this idea that more
watts equals better but we all know
that's not how performance works so I am
glad that in at least this one way
origins recommending a good amount of
power and not going crazy overkill on it
just to spike the price or use em DFS or
whatever
alright so frame rates are next this is
a very trivial test here it's not like
our GP reviews with frame rate testing
for SI billed you're gonna see the same
performance you see with the review of
the GTX 10 ad other than the pre
overclocked they've applied
but we're still gonna run through them
anyway so just if this is what to expect
if you want to play at 1440p or 480 this
system for quick burst at FPS tests
shows a 145 FPS average for black ops 3
on high with tightly times one percent
in point one percent blue is doom with
opengl 4.5 it's 121 FPS with settings
tweaks are Vulcan you could hit 144
Hertz
GTA 5 has worse 0.1 percent lows but
it's hitting a 113 FPS average and these
charts don't tell us anything we don't
already know obviously 1080 can handle
1440p the same is mostly true for 4k
which is represented on the screen now
the overclock is mostly beneficial but
we do see some stability test and
endurance runs
resulting in heat buildup and this does
actually negate the overclock pretty
much immediately and drops us down to
the 1600 megahertz range and that
impacts framerate over time if you were
to look at such a metric now build
quality as a whole this is one of the
places origin does pretty well in
addition to the power supply selection
component selection I mostly agreed with
I really wouldn't have made any major
changes to the components now obviously
this is this particular case is
basically a matter of pick the highest
end thing and put it in there so it's it
is kind of hard to do poorly with that
but the motherboard is a good one it's
an Asus z170 board they didn't go crazy
in that regard but it's it's not bad
either the assembly quality is good the
Cale management is very clean in the
main compartment you don't see a lot of
cables one major point that I would
really recommend Origen improve on is
the PCIe riser cable and I'm only
mentioning this because it doesn't
good the performance is gonna be the
same but the PCIe riser cable they're
using basically looks like it has duct
tape on it it's kind of a gray with I
think green and black so it's irrelevant
to performance you can't even see it
through this window so the average user
is never gonna know but if someone does
open it up and say maybe they produce
b-roll for a video it just looks kind of
bad so it's one of those things that
making it black isn't gonna impact
anything other than people won't think
it looks bad which is important if
you're trying to market a product so
that is a suggestion I would make but
it's kind of a moot suggestion in the
face of performance metrics because it
won't impact anything the other thing
with build quality tubes cables that's
done pretty well the overclock was 4.6
gigahertz on the CPU that's a pre OC the
voltage the be core was was maybe a
little aggressive but I would not feel
bad about the vcore I think it was one
point pushing like one point three
something like that I don't feel bad
about it but not bad for something
that's getting pushed out of a factory
the GPU was hitting a frequency of
nineteen sixty one megahertz also not
bad unfortunately can't really sustain
that because the thermals but it's a
decent overclock overall I believe they
use EVGA precision that's pre-installed
it auto boots the startup so
everything's done for you and that is
something that they do well PSU
selection is good they didn't go crazy
with any of that stuff
price is okay if you went to Newegg or
whatever and sort of picked us out
yourself which I did you'd be looking at
about 18 18 $1,800 for the build DIY
approach that's assuming you can find an
ITX case that's similar to this I kind
of just picked a row or a silver stone
rvz case that's like think $70 so you'd
be looking at about eighteen to nineteen
hundred dollars and then obviously you
build it yourself
this is 2396 having the notes here in
front of me now that includes the
fifteen dollar LED strip so it's 23
something that puts origin at about five
hundred and eighty dollars almost more
than DIY and that makes them really a
premium over some of their competitors
power is about 100 to 200 dollars more
on average for most of their systems if
you pick strictly part versus part we're
not changing the part selection here
cyber power is about the same 100 to 200
dollars more and that's really not
unreasonable if you don't want to build
a computer to pay someone 100 to 200
bucks to do it for you it's not that bad
of a deal now obviously folks you can do
it themselves do it yourself whatever so
it's it's got a bit of a premium versus
the competitors that fits origins sort
of boutique shop appearance and their
justification of this price is mostly
24/7 support pre over clocks and a
custom case so the one that we can audit
the best is the support I called the
support line I audited and so we called
tech support twice the first time it is
24/7 so the first time we call that 7:30
p.m. Eastern Time and I got no answer
after 25 minutes so I gave up I called
back during normal business hours during
this just before the shoot at 3:40 p.m.
Eastern and got an answer in under five
minutes from tech support which i think
is mostly acceptable
I think the way origin could improve
this would be a callback feature so
sometimes you'll call support and it's
like we have 30-minute wait do you want
us to call back when we're ready for you
hit one and it just does it I think they
should do that for their after normal
business hours support if it's gonna
take 30 minutes get an answer in terms
of competence I was pretty happy with
the tech support I acted like a complete
noob to hardware totally I told him I
didn't know anything about the computer
I don't know what video card was in it
all I know is I bought it like a year
ago and I said I saw the program that
said it's running at like 90 Celsius and
I wanted to see if that was okay and he
said 94 90 Fahrenheit 90 Celsius no
which it's correct he said no you should
check for software that's changing the
fan rpm you should check ventilation
dusts all the normal suggestions so I
completely agree with all the
suggestions made those are the ones I
would have made myself troubleshooting
with someone who doesn't know
they own and I think they've done well
in that regard I also called sales
support I got an answer in about a
minute
sales is always that way isn't it
because they want to tell you something
and a sales support I basically said I'm
on your site I don't know what I should
buy I have a 1080p monitor I'm playing
GTA 5 and mirrors edge at high settings
what's a good video card for me to own
and I was expecting them to say buy a
1080 because the most expensive and
they've got an idiot on their hands me
who clearly doesn't know any better they
didn't they said he actually directly
said I'm not gonna push you to the 1080
I think it's too expensive for what
you're doing
the 1070 makes more sense for you and I
more or less agreed with that based on
the kind of price range I gave him I
also asked him should I get
8 gigabytes of RAM or 16 he said you
don't need 16 gigabytes for just gaming
and watching streams you'll probably use
6 to 7 gigabytes during those tasks
simultaneously but you'll be fine and I
agree with that as well that's data I've
seen so their support is clearly
competent which is not always the case
for SI so well done Origen there all
right so overall this needs some work
with thermals it seriously it does that
is the main problem with this I am
pretty happy with the overall build
quality in part selection
other than that PCIe riser thing which
really is basically irrelevant I'm happy
with the support line for the most part
and I think that really the fault is in
thermals noise idles a bit loud but if
you fix thermals you fix fix the noise
because if it's running at 100% fan rpm
when this thing's under gaming load
that's obviously gonna be loud and it's
running at a high CPU rpm idle just
because a small kind of hot box and
there's another there's a fan back here
as well I believe which doesn't help
things so they need to work on thermals
the system as a whole is ok it's
acceptable the closest competition has
started the revolt 2 which is a wider
form factor and is flashy er so if you
don't want that in your living room or
something I guess you'd be looking at
something like this but this is
going to be a louder box so I wouldn't
really recommend it necessary for htpc
it would be okay if you're using it as
an on-the-go land computer or as a
system in your main gaming room where
you're gonna put headphones on you won't
hear the noise it's not that crazy loud
so don't let this get blown out of
proportion but it is loud enough where
in a living room home theater
environment I would not want it so
thermals that's the the only real issue
see if I have any other notes here not
really support was good build qualities
decent price is a bit high but not
terrible considering kind of origins
attempting to position themselves as a
boutique shop rather than a factory that
just pumps out systems like some of
their competitors
so I overall not bad that needs work but
ok overall I think the support is good
if you buy something like a mid Tower
from them it'd be much better obviously
so that's the review fold disclosure
origin sponsored us during the AMDR x
480 release I want to put that out there
this was the sponsor quite obviously we
don't let sponsorship interfere with
editorial quality or integrity or ethics
and that's really I just want to put
that out there because it's important so
