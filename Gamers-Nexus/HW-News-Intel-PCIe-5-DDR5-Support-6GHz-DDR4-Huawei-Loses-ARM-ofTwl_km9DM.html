leading into Computex for 2019 we just
landed in Taipei yesterday as of filming
and there's a lot of big news items
before the show including Intel's a new
road map looking at PCIe gen 5 and ddr5
leading into 2021 and tech companies
cutting ties with Huawei Samsung being
dethroned as one of the as the largest
semiconductor manufacturer by Intel the
once cane largest time I met somebody
conductor manufacturer and then some
news on HPE acquiring Cray before that
this video is brought to you by
Thermaltake C 360 DD C hard tubing water
cooling kit if you're ready to dip your
toes into the water and build your first
open-loop cooling system the Thermaltake
c 360 DD c hard tubing kit comes with
all the components you need to get
started so you won't have to worry about
forgetting anything
the kit includes a three sixty
millimeter radiator three 120 a RGB fans
i conferred w4 a RGB water block for the
cpu a pump and res d DC combo and all
the fittings needed to build a full cpu
open-loop the hard tubing kit also gives
a great launching point at a lower price
to get into open-loop building and
expandability and can easily be grown
with a GPU block if so desired
learn more at the link in the
description below so as stated we're
here in Taipei we're starting Computex
coverage early next week or in a couple
days from when this video goes live and
you'll want to check back for that we
have a lot of motherboard coverage lined
up relating to and these announcements
and the announcement coverage coming up
and then probably no real discussion on
GPUs but we'll see what comes out and if
there's anything on na'vi
for this past week intel server roadmap
is looking at ddr5 and PCIe gen 5
there's a screaming bird to my left
off-camera it's probably picking up on
the mic enjoy that that certain ated so
a recent server roadmap was leaked from
a hallway presentation for a bout of
irony as you'll see later in the episode
and outlined some serious io
advancements for intel's upcoming
technology so 2022 data center roadmap
is what we're looking at for this but
that is the predecessor to
eventually comes down to other Intel
platforms like in mainstream desktop
user enthusiasts desktop and these
include new code names for sapphire
Rapids and Granite Rapids and then both
sets who succeed the Cooper Lake and ice
Lake processors in the server segment
with ice leaks they'll kind of in the
eventually it will roll out phase
sapphire rapids SP seems poised for a
first quarter 2021 launch event I can
stick to the roadmap and that brings
with it ddr5 memory support and PCIe Gen
5 support as you all likely know by now
a PCIe gen 4 was first supported with
and the server processors and the
platform that accompanied them and will
be next supported by an DS mainstream
desktop platform for the rise and 3,000
launch coming up this summer so PCIe
jump 4 is been in the news Gen 5 is up
next but really it's just increasing and
bandwidth incrementally that data is
already out there on how much it
increases we can throw it on the screen
it's easily found on Wikipedia but Gen 4
verse Gen 3 you had about a 2x increase
in bandwidth per Lane
so ddr5 also in the news for that but
sapphire rapids will make use of the
Eagle stream platform a 2p machine
platform that will also be used for
granite Rapids no word on core counts or
frequencies for sapphire rapids yet but
sapphire rapids will be succeeded by
granite rapids in 2022 and that could
bring with it a generation / generation
improvement in silicon the clock speeds
and efficiency as one would expect it
appears that both processor families
will come out with the Intel 7 nanometer
nodes assuming 10 ever comes out we can
work our way towards 7 and it would be
sapphire rapids based on intel's first
generation of 7 nanometer and then
granite rapids with likely leverage a 7
nanometer Plus version because Intel is
committing further to the plus
demarcation Zin their process nodes so
as things roll forward you're going to
see a lot more of what we saw 14
nanometer where it's + + + + +
because Intel's been focusing on
iterating on its process nodes to get
more out of each node and to be fair 40
nanometer was pushed really far so
Intel's keeping with that approach tech
companies cutting ties with Huawei Amit
the us-china tensions so in what's been
an unprecedented move in both the tech
sector and the Android landscape Huawei
has found itself on a commerce trade
blacklist complements of the US federal
government following hallways addition
to the entity list several important
companies have been forced to sever ties
among the most critical are Google and
arm which will absolutely cripple
huawei's ability to ship phones and
other Android devices Google announced
that it will revoke hallways Android
license thus eliminating hall way to
using the Android Open Source project or
AOSP without access to Google's
proprietary services like the App Store
or the Play Store being Apple and Google
there this would make any fork of AOSP
unrecognizable and limits the usefulness
especially in the Western markets who
always already come out and stated that
they have an OS ready Huawei apparently
anticipated such a move so it's got an
OS internally ready for use this would
likely see more success in China where
the the leading application is WeChat
including for payment of things so
beyond that probably wouldn't have as
much pickup in the Western markets which
we do depend on either the app store
from Apple or the Play Store from Google
and this would be Google since they've
been Android devices
up till now anyway so among the other
news from the Swami has silently been
working on its OS as the company
anticipated losing Google and losing arm
is however nothing short of devastating
this one was a little last expected
nearly every chip inside a smartphone or
a tablet is based on arm designs and
without some foundation or IP on which
to base the chips Huawei's chip building
ambitions are effectively dead also on
the growing list of companies turning
away from hallway is Intel and then
along with them Qualcomm Broadcom and
Xilinx all pledging not to supply the
company until further notice by way has
suggested it could replace its American
suppliers with those found in China but
that's dubious as a claim to say the
least there's a chance that Huawei could
potentially replicate some components
but it's unlikely that it could be done
at the scale and the speed while we
would need to do it at to recoup their
upcoming losses and this is the second
largest phone maker in the world behind
Sam
so it's a big deal more to the point
though by way it needs to need to access
to the software the IP and the
technology that is developed by its
American firms so we'll have more
coverage on how this develops but in
addition to that the Huawei ban and the
US has caught other tech companies in
the crossfire for revenue losses due to
hallways existence on the trade
blacklist now several American suppliers
are expecting losses including and the
Intelligent Qualcomm Broadcom with some
being a bit more exposed than others and
II for example has more exposure despite
having a lower absolute figure of
revenue loss then say Intel and these
got more exposure to it because it's a
greater percentage of AMD's total
revenue Intel's revenue loss is looking
at somewhere around 85 million dollars
which is let's see it is about one
percent of its total revenue so not a
huge hit to Intel and D is looking to
lose about thirty nine million and then
Microsoft is up there in the nearly 30
million at range as well Broadcom
however stands to lose the most revenue
from the loss of Huawei's of clients and
that's at 508 million dollars but broad
comms exposure is is far from the
highest it's there they're doing better
than some of the others here and videos
on the list as well so as Microsoft the
early estimates and Goldman Sachs is
involved in this for what that's worth
but the early estimates point to an 11
billion dollar loss for the American
suppliers collectively next up intel
ending Samsung's semiconductor reign we
previously reported on when Intel was
surpassed by Samsung as the most popular
or the largest growing semiconductor
manufacturer in the world where in toss
up until then reigned supreme for
decades but that's flipped again so as I
see insights reports Intel's once again
the number one semiconductor vendor in
the world dethroning Samsung which
dethroned Intel for the crown in 2017 so
took about two years to catch back up
this is in no small part thanks to the
abrupt downturn in the DRAM market
you've likely seen this in DRAM prices
finally coming down and offsetting Intel
CPU shortage which Intel is also getting
back on top of sir first for second half
of 2019 Intel CPU shortage should be
effectively over from what we've heard
Samson the writing's been on the wall
for some time now DRAM markets pretty
predictable and moves in waves the
company went as far as warning its
investors in the first quarter 2019
revenue report that it's greatly missing
its mark due to massive price declines
in memory Samsung's lead was built on
the massive memory business it was
enjoying during the several quarter of
booming memory prices and this is
something that we looked into
extensively in fact almost every weekly
news episode had discussion of memory
prices for probably about a year so
Intel's propulsion back to the top was
almost expected here and it's one that
Intel has has been struggling to find
with ten nanometer issues and shortages
in CPU supply especially 14-man
nanometer but it is coming back and this
this may be something to return to the
default position for Intel and Samsung
HPE acquiring supercomputer Pioneer cray
we probably first talked to you all
about Cray when we did a computer
history museum tour with Jim Vincent and
Silicon Valley looking at the original
krai supercomputers but now the
discussion for Cray was relating to AMD
and Cray working together to build the
newest the most powerful supercomputer
which is frontier in the next couple of
years
hewlett-packard enterprise and Cray have
jointly confirmed that HPE will buy the
supercomputer maker for 1.3 billion
dollars the president and CEO of HPE
stated quote answers to solve society's
most pressing challenges are buried in
massive amounts of data only by
processing and analyzing this data will
we be able to unlock the answers to
critical challenges across medicine
climate change space and more and
presumably this will also help answer
the question of the answer to life the
universe and everything which she's
probably still 42 but we'll check on
that for you cray in furthering this
quote Cray is a global technology leader
in supercomputing and shares our deep
commitment to innovation by combining
our world-class teams and technology
we'll have the opportunity to drive the
next generation of high performance
computing and play an important part in
advancing the way people live and work
Craig got its start in 1972 as stated
it's it's old so cray the cray-1
supercomputer was the biggest item of
the time that we were talking about in
the computer history museum we have some
footage of it
had water-cooled supercomputers as well
so water cooling started way back when
even before J's two cents and Cray is
often associated with the most powerful
supercomputers on the planet including
the recently announced frontier slated
to be the world's first exascale
supercomputer HPE will leverage Cray and
its associated technologies to address
the emerging HPC or high performance
computing market and the exascale market
segment where HPE intends to bolster its
HPC as a service offerings HP also
intends to build an end-to-end HPC
portfolio consisting of storage software
compute and interconnect this will allow
HPE to connect its ore to extend its
footprint across a broader set of
markets the last one for this before we
actually start the show a data and
micron are leap frogging one another for
overclocking records in the space and
this one is for memory overclocking
world records so micron and a data
seemed content to keep trading the crown
for the world's fastest kit of ddr4
memory and all the bragging rights that
are afforded there in just recently
micron laid claim to the world record
for ddr4 memory frequency with a
hardware bot validated record of fifty
seven twenty six megahertz / 5.7
gigahertz for memory and that blows past
a data's previous record of 56 34 at
this point every every one megahertz is
a big deal because they're pushing
pretty high now a data is back to
leapfrog micron score and this moves to
an impressive overclock 57-38 megahertz
also validated by Hardware bought a data
achieved the overclock with a kit of its
own spectryx D is 60 gr GB ddr4 memory
now our theory is presently that they
have the RGB set to just read so that
that probably helped with increasing the
score a bit but again this is something
we'll have to research heavily there in
Computex and get back to you on
obviously these records are set using
liquid nitrogen no surprise especially
on the CPU front and this is something
we've talked about a lot in the past
couple weeks but aside from the bragging
rights memory makers that love these
overclocking competitions because it's
great self-promotion
for many years Samson's bita in memory
where were the ICS of choice for
overclockers has been a topic of
discussion with the rise and processors
as they
grown in their markets prominence and
Samson is discontinuing its betide ships
this year so we'll see where the room at
the top for the gold standard of memory
goes if it's gonna stay with Samson or
go to one of their competitors micron
and a data though are certainly making
their case to keep around the high-end
memory ICS so that's it for this news
