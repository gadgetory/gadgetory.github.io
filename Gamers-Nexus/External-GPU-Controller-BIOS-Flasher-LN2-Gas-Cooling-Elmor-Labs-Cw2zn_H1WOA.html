at Computex 2019 I've got two pretty
cool things here one of them you may not
have seen the show and it's an external
voltage controller but it does a few
other things too this from Elmore one of
the extreme overclockers who used to
work at Asus up until recently so you
could use this to do something like
external BIOS like be BIOS flash or
voltage control we'll talk about that a
bit more later there's also the ice cube
with that astonishes sort of a case mod
it's a case fabrication really before
that this video is brought to you by
thermal take C 360 DD C hard tubing
water cooling kit if you're ready to dip
your toes into the water and build your
first open-loop cooling system the
thermal takes C 360 DD C hard tubing kit
comes with all the components you need
the kit includes a three sixty
millimeter radiator 3 128 a RGB fans a
copper W 4 a RGB water block for the CPU
a pump and res DD C combo and all the
fittings needed to build a full CPU
open-loop learn more at the link in the
description below the way this works is
it builds a basically a liquid nitrogen
intake that turns into a nitrogen gas
and then you have a cooling system
inside that's semi passive but what's
really happening here is there's a
transfer hose coming out of an Allen C
tanks about 180 liter tank it's pretty
standard and I think over the past since
the beginning of the day it's 5:00 p.m.
now so since like 9:00 a.m. the tank has
used about 110 liters maybe maybe a
hundred liters so he's gone through a
lot of it there's maybe there's not much
left at this point so for one day
cooling you end up with this box
sustained at well it's currently at
minus 25 but I think in Romans video it
was much lower than that when we did a
video with him on his channel and the
intake comes in to the bottom box the
bottom box is a 5 millimeter thick
aluminum wall on all sides inside of
that box can't see it in footage but
there's another box that one the LNT
transfers into the box and then
evaporates and comes up to cool the
system so the way it transfers transfer
hose at the end of it has that hexagon
nozzle that we've shown in our videos in
the past that is fitted to basically
water cooling fitting and then that
feeds into a thick hose so it's an
insulating material like you might use
in an autumn
application feeds into a hose and then
comes out into the inner box the inner
chamber and as it evaporates you get the
cool gas coming up directly under the
motherboard so motherboards flat here
there's a hole in the middle of the box
under the CPU socket so from that hole
comes up the nitrogen gas as the ln2
evaporates and that cools the whole
system by filling the cube and then
there's the heatsink tower cooler that
has a fan blowing but it's not like to
blow the heat off the fin stack because
when you're this cold it's that's not
really hits pointless it's actually just
to circulate the air so or the gas so
that it can come out down this hard
tubing hose that sticks up to the top
comes out here then comes out of the
sides of the case and you can actually
feel the cool air coming out of the box
so other than that I mean it's got two
acrylic cubes that are sandwiched
together and that's just because with
ln2 cooling you start doing with things
like condensation and ice buildup and
making sure you can contain the gas
without just like freezing everything
over and this took about a week a full
week of work for almora to build and it
was not easy work because he had the
source parts he had to make changes had
you probably ran into a few mistakes
along the way like for example he was
telling me that if it weren't
evaporating properly in the lower
chamber like if you just had the liquid
nitrogen build-up and it weren't
evaporating ever then you'd end up
eventually bubbling up into the box but
I don't know if that actually happened
he didn't tell me I'm guessing no it
seems like he he was aware of this
concern before getting into it so that's
what Ice Cube it's just cool I mean this
isn't literally I guess it's it's
obviously not like a product it's like a
cool tech demo of liquid nitrogen at the
g-scale booth where they're doing a
bunch of overclocking competition anyway
so very interesting to see and different
to application of Allen - reminds us a
bit of the Robo clock or from Vince from
kingpin last year except it's less Robo
and more just
lnto gas I mean no one's standing here
it's been running more or less on its
own this is the the EBC - so this will
be available on Elmore's website it's
Elmore labs calm
it's not up yet it should be up probably
within the next maybe month or so he's
not a hundred percent final on the
release date yet but this is something
we could have used a lot in the past so
it does a lot of different things one of
them is it can do an external bio splash
so we need to externally flash your
video card or your motherboard maybe you
don't have like for example the software
tools to do it just yet if you have a
pre-release review sample of a card or
more realistically if you like blow up
your bios or something and need a need
to flash on another one
but yeah so EB C 2 can also hook into
the board and give you like power
readings or voltage readings you can
hook into a GPU and do external voltage
control for the GPU which is actually
what Rowan did originally and like the
RIP GN thing before he did the most
recent one they maybe even to the most
recent one but he hooked into it
an EB C controller and control the
voltage directly so he could beat our
scores so anyway EB C 2 will be on
Elmore labs comm this is actually one of
the things that I found more interesting
at the show because it's like a small
product by one guy by L Moore that has a
lot of functional uses that we can apply
in our own lab so I find that pretty
exciting and look forward to trying it
out that's it for this video though
