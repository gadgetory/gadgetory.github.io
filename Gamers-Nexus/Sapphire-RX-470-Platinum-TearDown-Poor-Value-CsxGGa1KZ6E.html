tearing apart and rx 470 so this is the
sapphire one it is the card that we just
reviewed the Platinum Edition sapphire
card which you look at it is basically
an RX 480 and I can see a fierce
reflection on the camera so I don't know
that's doing but this is basically a 480
reference design cooler with a back
plate from sapphire and then it's been
painted silver so this is basically an
identical cooler to what we saw in our
our X 480 teardown and hybrid build this
video is not going to be the beginning
of a hybrid build for the 470 I'm not
gonna do one of those just like with the
1070 we're skipping this because it's
basically the same card in that aspect
with regard to cooling and things like
that and we're gonna be looking at
mostly the same parts but I want to take
this apart because I wanna see the PCB
and I'm curious to see if it's the same
as what we had with the 480 and so we're
just gonna tear it down look over the
PCB and that will pretty much be it for
for this video so basically same process
as with the RX 480
you can see that they've removed the
fake screws there were fake screws here
on the 480 reference cooler or shroud
those have been removed with this half
fire version and now we are left just
with the usual back plate screws so so
this if it's not obvious the cooler the
fan part of the cooler extends past the
PCB just like with the 480 so we've got
this part here with obviously no PCB
attached I'm like what Nvidia decided to
do this card and the 480 do not have the
PCIe header at the end of the board
which means that we're not going to be
dealing with the same sort of soldered
wire setup where there's an extender
wire that's been soldered to the PCB to
put the power header at the end of the
board so we're not gonna be looking at
that here there's a pretty simple design
anymore of these are there
these are very small so for these I'm
just gonna do opposing corners as as we
normally do the back pleat I think is
actually loose and looks like looks like
it can come off there's something
hanging on to it what is it guys
oh thermal pad was hanging onto it so
the thermal pad sits right here this
looks like this is where the the vrm is
you can see the chokes or the inductors
are planted here on the other side of
the card and then we've probably got a
capacitor bank on the opposite side of
this and then the MOSFETs are probably
on the opposite or actually the MOSFETs
are probably right there that is almost
certainly why the thermal pad was
sitting there so there's our back plate
pretty standard stuff piece of metal
with a thermal pad and actually what is
that over touch it's a window it's just
a window so let's get this retention off
now we just got to get the card away get
the PCB away from the shroud and the
cooler we're still attached over here
and these two screw points which is for
the expansion yeah that's actually not a
necessary to come out but we're gonna do
it anyway
all right there we go
well these fans these fans really suck
to disconnect hey guys so you've got the
PCB and the shroud it should be a very
familiar sight if you saw our X 480 tear
down we'll look at this in just a moment
and looks like I'll have to look at the
footage I don't remember that was a
copper I'm pretty sure that was a copper
plate on the original so the vrm has
been lightened up a bit which if you
look at the board you see these two
blank spots right here so what we end up
with is a four-phase vrm instead of
these six of the original our X 480 so
it's been trimmed down which will
probably explain some of our
overclocking limitations that I'm not
positive on that if that's if you see
our review you'll see we're pretty
limited on the overclock this time
around perhaps actually a hardcore
overclock and we'll explain that better
he's got a good channel on that but for
phase capacitor bank and the MOSFETs
which also have been slimmed down you
can see a couple of missing MOSFETs here
save some money for AMD and other than
that we've got the usual V RAM modules
one two three four five six seven eight
modules that's interesting wait a minute
four two four eight bits in a byte 4
gigabits one gigabyte two gigabytes
three gigabytes four gigabytes
okay cool there are eight modules here
obviously this is a 4 gigabyte card so
knowing that they're obviously either
gonna be one gigabyte chips that are
locked down like the rx 480 or they're
gonna be half that density 512 megabyte
chips and you end up with 1 gigabyte for
every 2 so we look this model number up
for reference the number is SK Hynix
hynek's and it's let's see I've it on my
phone h 5g c for h2 for aj r and looking
at their website that is for gigabit
density 16 banks so
gddr5 obviously for gigabit density so
what you end up with is with eight bits
in a byte you have four Giga bits 8 Giga
bits that's one gigabyte one two three
four so four gigabytes total vram so
this card is not one where like the RX
480
you were able to unlock from 4 to 8 with
the v bios or a hack this isn't
something that that'll work for because
these chips are physically not one
gigabyte chips so they can't unlocked
anything else other than obviously what
their native density is so that's that's
what we've got for VRAM for the vrm kind
of described that a little bit and the
rest extra phase over here for memory 6
pin power header plug for the fan and
that's it that's everything we've got
for the PCB itself let's pull this thing
out and look at that if I can see
there's a what's holding it in the way
yeah nothing thermal pads obviously
connector for the vrm blower fan or just
the blower fan general I guess does more
than vrm cooling and we've got this sink
for the MOSFETs this sink on the other
side of the capacitors and then this for
vram cooling so that's the cooling set
up very simple exactly the same as the
480 this block should look pretty
similar as well same block looks like
identical block of just aluminum fins
there's no heat pipes in here nothing
special it's just an old-school aluminum
fin style heatsink and then you've got
your plate your cold plate here that
touches the GPU silicon directly so
they've gotten rid of the copper circle
you know it would be really interesting
test is taking that one and putting it
on here and seeing how it's actually
different yeah same thing other than the
original cooler or the heatsink had a
copper circle in the middle so this
actually we wanted to we
could take the original are X 480 sync
and drop it right there and test the
thermals on that as well and we even
have a thermal paste applicator that
would make sure that their own paste is
applied exactly the same on each surface
so there would be no variance and
application but I don't think we're
gonna have time to do that but maybe
maybe in the future
so that's it that's everything that the
RX 470 has to offer at least this
version of it yes this is a partner card
just as a reminder this isn't there's
there's no reference rx 470 so to speak
is only partner card so that means
they'll vary a little bit anyway some of
the vendors have custom PCBs some of
them are insane and are selling their
card at $240 which really makes no sense
at all don't buy those but those one
certainly would have well hopefully
would have custom PCBs they definitely
have custom coolers now this however is
a reference arts 480 cooler on a card
that is pre overclocked by 10 megahertz
netting zero difference and the cooler
is the same cooler that was on the rx
for any reference card so there you have
it this is this is basically here's
here's something that we didn't talk
about in the review because I didn't
have the prices of these tins when the
review on live the rx 470 has an MSRP of
$180 which as we said that in the review
is pretty good
this card is selling at $200 and I
suppose the defense they're for buying
one of these as opposed to a $200 or 4
gigabyte rx 480 which would give you
about a 10% performance difference I
think the argument is well it's pre
overclocked so it's worth an extra $20
and also I guess it's silver I'm not
really I'm not really sure if there's an
argument for the cooler I think the
argument is that it's pre overclocked
here's the thing as we show in the
frequency overtime charts it's still
going like crazy frequency it's not huge
swings it's less than 100 megahertz
swings but the point is you're not
actually sustaining that 12 16 mega
Hertz at
Tai's boost its peaking there maybe a
couple times per test that we did the
average is still closer to the 1200 1206
range of the sort of advertised AMD spec
so the ten megahertz overclocked first
of all ten megahertz is not something to
brag about or charge $20 for secondly
it's not really sustaining it anyway
because the cooler is throttling at 78
degrees Celsius every time it hits 78
the frequency drops until the cooler
hits 77 or 76 and then it maintains at
that point so the point of this sort of
junction at the end here is that the
platinum edition of the rx 470 at $200
which is what it's signed for with four
gigabytes of locked vram mean you can't
unlock it to eight a reference are X 480
cooler and a pre overclock that is
frankly irrelevant in the scheme of
things it makes no sense to buy this it
would make more sense to buy an RX 480
four gigabyte card even though in the
review I said skip that one because
they're the same price when they're the
same price the original argument becomes
a little bit less valid now in terms of
the rx 470 is a product the reviews
still stands conclusion still stands
there are $180 versions out there the
power color one is the one I would point
you toward and it has a better cooler
and will hopefully be reviewing that
soon so that's the one to look at right
now I know a couple other vendors have
models out we have an MSI one that just
came in not sure what it costs but some
some extra thoughts that add on to the
review that we didn't publish originally
because we didn't have all the pricing
data at that time $180 goodbye $200 it's
I'm almost offended that the cooler is
what it is but I mean thermal is a lot
of what we do so it's easy for me to get
offended at thermal but as always pay
