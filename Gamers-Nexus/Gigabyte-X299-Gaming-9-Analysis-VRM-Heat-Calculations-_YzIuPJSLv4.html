going to be taking a look at gigabytes X
299 gaming 9 motherboard so this is the
top of the line board from gigabyte 4 X
299 as of right now there is rumors that
there might be a second wave of
motherboards for like the 18 core and
such but as of right now this is
definitely the top board that you can
get from gigabyte so interestingly
enough it also shares a lot of the vrm
design with some of the lower end boards
so I'm pretty sure for like the gaming 7
basically everything I say here is
relevant for that board as well as far
as the V RMS are concerned the features
are different but the VR ends stay the
same pretty far down the Gigabyte
motherboard stack 4x 299 before getting
to that this coverage is brought to you
by our 10 year anniversary edition
shirred which has an exploding design
layout on the front the shirt comes in
both teal and gray with tri-blend and
cotton materials and celebrates the 10th
year since we started designing gamers
Nexus botnet ultimately leading to its
launch about nine and a half years ago
you go to gamers Nexus at
squarespace.com to pick up one of the
shirts so before we get to the VRMs
we'll go I'll just point out some
interesting features that the board has
it has a power switch and power button
right there reset button right there
clear bios over here postcode down here
which I'm personally not a fan of
because if you put well they don't have
the right spacing for for why do they
nope it doesn't so it's not really an
issue but if you were running a multi
GPU set up there is a chance that you
might end up covering the postcode and
then you can't see it in that that's
annoying to say the least so I don't
really and actually same goes for the
button so buttons so they slow like
positioning for these things that you
need to access is really less than ideal
if you're running a multi sheepy you set
up but those are super rare to these
days so it's not really a huge issue for
most people and the board does have dual
BIOS so I can't actually point out where
the BIOS chips are because you can sort
of see one of them here but I haven't
managed to find the other one but it
does have
gigabytes to a while so if you you know
are flashing the balls on the board and
something goes really really wrong
you're still not actually you're you
don't really have a problem because the
dual BIOS will recover from that really
really easily so yeah that's that's a
nice feature to have on board and
gigabyte puts it almost basically on
almost every board date they make so
that's standard gigabyte right there now
then let's start taking a look at the
actual vrm starting with the biggest and
most important one the VCC n or also
known as the core erm and this this is a
problem caused by the fact that X 299 is
is two completely different two
completely different architect well
architecture so to speak well dies so
you have skylake X which has a fiber and
then you have KB like X which doesn't
have a fiver
for those of you I'm not talking about
the fiber coin I'm talking about the
fully integrated voltage regulator and
so basically that is a bit of circuitry
built into the sky like CX CPUs which
takes a single voltage and converts it
into all the other voltages the CPU
needs internally and it exists because
it's a great way to save power on the
motherboard of erm because ultimately it
is really really hard to push a lot of
current at low voltage so the fiber
basically takes a slightly higher
voltage it's still not straight 12 volts
it takes in say 1.8 to 2 volts and it
converts that down to the core vccs AVC
cio any other voltages the CPU needs it
produces all of those off of a single
voltage so the VCC and vrm does that
however if you put in a KB like X CPU
instead of a sky like X which if you're
putting a KB like xcp you into this
motherboard there's probably you're
probably doing something wrong because
this board costs way more than a KB like
X chip does so that's some weird
priorities you have there but if you put
a KB like xcp you into this motherboard
what ends up happening is
CCN is no longer VCC and it is now the
core and the reason for that is is
because kb like x doesn't have the fully
integrated voltage regulator so it has
to have all of its voltage supplied by
them all of its voltages supplied
externally from the motherboard so
that's why you also have this phase
right here and then this vrm right here
and basically this is VCC SA and this
right here is VCC IO
those only run if you have a kV like X
CPU because otherwise they don't need to
exist
so yeah it's Intel you know that this is
what happens when you shove a KB like
die because that's ultimately what KB
like X is is just a regular old KB like
die but on the X 299 package because X
299 has a much better package for power
delivery which is why you get the better
overclocking on KB like X the downside
is is the motherboards basically need to
add extra components that are completely
unnecessary for running skylight deck
CPUs in the process so yeah that's kind
of less than ideal anyway back to the
VCC N or also also known as V core vrm
it's a one two three four five six seven
eight phase setup it is controlled by
this chip right here and that chip is a
International rectifier ir35 2:01
running in eight phase mode so you do
actually get a true eight phase right
here and it goes from 200 kilohertz
switching frequency all the way up to
two megahertz though international
rectifier power strip pages are
typically optimized for 300 kilohertz
switching frequencies so that's what I'm
going to be doing all the calculations
for this vrm with and also what the
board is probably running I have no idea
based on just pictures of the
motherboard even if I had the board in
hand I'd probably end up having to use
an oscilloscope to figure out what
frequency or on that so let's talk about
the power capabilities of this lovely
thing
the power stages which I've already
mentioned are these chips right here and
these are international rectifier again
because you usually use the same brand
power stages a controller manufacturer
these are ir35 five sixes these are 50
amp power stages and unfortunately I
cannot get a full public datasheet for
these so instead I'm using the
International rectifier three five five
one datasheet which is also a 50 amp
power stage and the predecessor of the
35:56 the main difference between sort
of the newer generation of international
rectifier power stages like the 35:56
here compared to say its predecessor the
35 51 is the new generation of power
stages is a lot more power power
efficient at higher switching
frequencies however they are still
optimized to run best at 300 kilohertz
whereas like but the older ones would
like get really really inefficient as
early as like 600 kilohertz whereas you
know the newer ones could go up to 600
kilohertz before it gets really really
bad so there's a small improvement in
efficiencies while there is a pretty
significant improvement in efficiency at
higher switching frequency well
ultimately most boards aren't going to
run it because you get best efficiency
yet around 300 kilohertz so that's what
I'm doing all my calculations with I'm
also not going to do any calculations
for Kb like X because it's just
blackened one you shouldn't put kV like
X in this motherboard 2 KB like X is not
concerning compared to Skye like X in
terms of power consumption and current
draws so I'll just do all the skylake X
will go through values for skylake X and
you know that that's going to be the
comparison point from other boards
because KB like X is just a lower load
really it's just easier to run them sky
like X so since we're going to be
calculating for Sky like X and I'm going
to give you different power levels for
different overclocks so 150 watts that
is a 7900 X app stock 200 watts would be
a very very mild overclock mind you
these numbers are peak loads are like
prime95
or in one case
Cinebench because this board with where
we've run into some weird issues in
testing with it
where you basically like you try to run
prime95 avx-512 on it and the power draw
ends up being lower than Cinebench at
some point so the board is obviously
powers rather like the CPU is obviously
throttling but there's no way to get rid
of that so yeah that's that's a bit of
an issue then 250 watts so this is
probably where most people will stop
between 250 and 300 watts the reason for
that is is passed this point you need
deal is also exceeding this point like
this is where we run into the power
throttling because basically we can't
get the CPU so pull more than two it
like we can get a stable overclock and
usable overclock at 264 watts of power
draw so for the 7970 900 X that we have
here at gamers Nexus that was done at
4.5 gigahertz 1.17 5 volts
v core so yeah and that's you know
that's not that's V core not VCC n
that's a major distinction so this is
the voltage the CPU actually ends up
like that's what the core that's that
that's what comes out of the fiber so
the VCC end goes into the fiber this
comes out of the fiber ultimately what
this erm is seeing is not that the vrm
will see a constant 1.8 volts because it
doesn't really seem to do anything to
change VCC in on skylight X so far and
so all my ratings are also at 1.8 volts
so yeah I sort of this is where we max
out and another issue with this max out
was beyond this the CPU temperatures
just go through the apps like through
the roof you very quickly end up hitting
90 plus degrees 95 plus degrees under
under stress test which you can't do
anything about and now you may be
thinking oh but I'll get a custom water
loop and I'll totally get an even higher
overclock you won't because
unfortunately the thermal interface
material used on Skye like ax
is so bad now basically the water in the
AIO that we use to do this overclock was
really not that hot relative to how much
you know relative to how much power the
CPU was putting out so that was with
high rpm fans and everything and
basically the a IO radiator was pretty
much cold and the CPU was cooking
because the thermal the thermal
interface material that intel is using
or just the way it supplied one of the
two is really really like it's just
blocking all heat transfer from the die
to your cooling system so a bigger
cooling system won't help you because
your bottleneck is the thermal paste
under the IHS so to exceed that 300
watts or 250 watts of power draw you're
going to need to the lid your CPU but if
you do to lead your CPU it is completely
possible to go as high as 400 watts or
if your cooling system is up to it even
500 watts of power draw so I will do
count I've done calculations all the way
up to there I'm assuming that 1.8 volts
for all of those figures so the current
levels for these different numbers are
you know for 150 watts you're looking at
sort of 85 amps through the VRM and I've
just realized that I should have not put
this right in the middle of my stuff but
oh well 85 amps through the vrn that
would produce about 10 watts of heat so
not an issue I don't know have a board
well ultimately
you know do in testing for thermal vrm
thermals I do not have the board and it
is impossible like I can calculate how
much heat the vrm will put out for a
given amount of power that it needs to
supply and current it needs to output
but I cannot I cannot tell you if the
cooling system is good enough to
actually deal with that so yeah but 150
watts one point four eight volts you'll
get you know around 85 amps and 10 watts
of heat off the erm 200 watts of CPU
power consumption you're going to be
looking at about a hundred and ten amps
through the vrm and I'll produce about
13 watts so still
like that should be non-issue 250 watts
you're going to be looking at about a
hundred and forty amps and about 16
watts of heat so I still think this
should be relatively not not problematic
since you're only exceeding the stock
heat output by like you know 60% which
is a law but once we get into the bigger
power numbers you're going to see where
where the issues start showing up 300
watts you'll be looking at around a
hundred and sixty five amps also which
translates to about 21 watts of the heat
output on the vrm 400 watts is 220 amps
and 31 watts of heat this is where I
think you'll start seeing the rme
thermal issues and we can keep going up
because it is still possible to push the
power draw even higher at 500 watts 1.8
volts the vrm will have to output about
280 amps of power current and will
produce about 47 watts of heat that is a
problem that's like a low-end CPU worth
of heat that's like a laptop CPU source
of heat output so yeah that that is
really really hot it will need a
substantial heatsink you'll probably
even need to give it extra airflow if
you have a cooling system sufficient to
this to pay 500 watts of CPU power
consumption and as well as you know the
diluted CPU so that your cooling system
can actually get to those 500 watts
because the thermal paste that comes on
these CPU stock will definitely stop you
from actually getting anywhere near that
before the CPU basically thermal
throttles so yeah that's the sort of erm
situation I don't really see it as a
like I don't really see it as a huge
problem because we've not like Steve
hasn't managed to get the board to give
the CPU more than 264 watts of power and
that kind of power draw level you're
looking at between 16 and 21 watts of
heat which you like even an anemic and
kind of badly designed vrm heatsink
shouldn't really have a problem with but
if you do deal it'd
you might run into serious issues
because like that that's a lot of heat
output now just for the sake of
comparison I've gone ahead and also
calculated what the 220 amps would do on
a z2 70 gaming nine because that's like
the same class of motherboard is this I
know it's on a different chipset but
it's the same sort of target and so I've
calculated the z2 70 gaming nine and its
16 phase erm except that has is using
international rectifier 35:53 power
stages which I do have a public data
sheet for so that's great and
interestingly enough that 16 phase using
the 35:53 power stages which are 40 amps
instead of 50 amps produces the exact
same amount of heat as this one does for
220 amps of power consumption i mean
current draw at 1.8 volts 300 kilohertz
switching frequency so that actually
really surprised me because I was kind
of hope like there are still some
motherboards on mainstream Intel
platforms where the vrm is actually
better than what you'll find on a lot of
X 299 motherboards but at least there's
no recent examples of that so I don't
know if that means ecology has just gone
downhill across the board or if you know
as I guess you could say quality has
just gone downhill across the board
couldn't you because there's no real
reason to not give a super high-end
platform a super high-end vrm I mean
this is definitely sufficient and you
know one of the major issues with X 299
vrm design is the fact that you need to
somehow fit the VRM between the two
banks of 4 memory slots but this could
be stronger you know it's not a problem
for your even on a 70 900 X and normal
overclocking use and you shouldn't run
into issues if you deal it if you
somehow manage circumvent all the power
throttling stuff yeah you can definitely
get to the arm to overheat because then
your power consumption will balloon get
kind of silly your current draw will go
way up and the vrm heat output will go
through the through the roof
but for normal day-to-day overclocking I
don't really see a problem with with the
RM here so yeah I mean that's not really
a good thing to say about a
top-of-the-line board in my opinion
because this is the gaming nine so it
should be held to higher standards but
uh well it is what it is I'll let you
pass your own judgement on this I'm just
the messenger
anyway let's move on to all the other
minor VRMs on the board so starting off
with a VC CA right here which it just
conveniently happens to be there and now
I'm starting to think this might not be
VCC i/o now let's go to BBC CIO anyway
so this is VC CSA and that's control
that's a single-phase controlled by this
chip right here and that is an IR
through point ir 3 3 5 2 0 4 that is a
four phase voltage controller I have not
written down anyway it runs in one phase
mode here anyway so yeah it's not a
problem I have the important part it's
running in one phase mode and it's
controlling an international rectifier
IR power stage again and that is a IR
35:53 so that's that 40 amp power stage
which this is just ridiculous overkill
for VP TSA this vrm is only ever used on
kV like like on a lot of motherboards
sort of from from kV like you'd see a
vrm like half as big or even a quarter
of what this is for VC si si so 40 amp
hours of 40 amp power stage IR 35:53
absolutely not an issue
massive overkill there I don't have any
complaints and I just realize that that
goes over another vrm that we're going
to be talking about the memory vrm
located right over here so this provides
your ddr4 6 power and it's using it's a
two-phase again using the same IR that
and it's also using IR 35:53 power
stages again
in fact basically every single one of
the minor VRML on this board is also a
3553 that there is a 3553 that's the
3553 AB 63 that and that is also a 3553
this voltage controller up here is yet
another ir35 to 0 for this set of phases
over here is memory again so basically
here they put them in a corner and next
to each other here they put them you
know in behind each other and sort of to
the left of the memory slots so that's
your memory power there both of these
are two-phase VRMs both of them are
controlled by the same 35 to 0-4 voltage
controller both of them are completely
ridiculous overkill for ddr4 so that's
nice I'm guessing what happened is
gigabyte got like like Infineon started
giving away I our 3553 s 2 gigabyte for
free or something because I've seen a
lot of gigabyte boards and there's just
I our 3553 s everywhere and I just kind
of noticed from a few boards I've looked
over recently and it's just it's if it's
a vrm it's probably using a 3553 which
you know that's nice because you get a
lot of ridiculous overkill in places but
on the other hand it's a bit wasteful
maybe I guess it does make the Bill of
Materials a lot simpler though so that's
nice let's move on to the other
remaining vrm there's the VCC i/o which
is basically similar to the VCC si
that's your system agent that's
basically the memory system and PCIe and
that's the other part of the memory
system and PCIe these voltages affect
memory overclocking and if you're
running a lot of GPUs they would also
affect that but basically you don't have
to worry about voltage regulation
although they're very low-power it's
just a case of like yet they exist um
moving on the other minor rail these
guys right here
those are both VPP I cannot find the
voltage controller for them and VPP is
the that's a supporting voltage for your
ddr4 memory sticks
this is a power rail that was so small
that it used to be integrated into ddr3
Stakes like this voltage didn't exist on
ddr3 because ddr3 produced this voltage
on the state on the memory sticks
themselves so this is a very very
low-power vrm and the use of the IR
35:53 on these is just even more
ridiculous overkill than the use of IR
3553 s anywhere else on this board so
yeah I'm 99% sure a gigabyte just has a
warehouse full of these and they don't
know what to do with them anymore
because they're putting them everywhere
which you know that's a good thing but I
guess vcore vrm could could it be better
so now that pretty much wraps it up for
the arms on this board there's nothing
left for nothing left I can still cover
here but memory power definitely just
Flying V CGS AVC cio are just fine
there's no issues with those VCC n /r e
core it could be bigger it probably
should be bigger for one thing the 35:56
is not the most powerful power stage
that would fit into this package right
here like I mean the actual physical
board space because that's the main
constraint with X 299 you need to fit
your VR M into a very small relatively
small footprint
the thing is international rectifier
makes a 60 amp hour stage that states
basically in the exact same amount of
space as a 35:56 so using the 35:56
instead of the 3555 is almost entirely a
cost-saving measure from gigabyte
because the 3555 would actually get you
better
vrm efficiency but yeah that's that's
kind of a thing ultimately it's not like
the VR M is going to blow up on you it
might get really hot if you get past the
cooling restrictions of kind of sky like
X but if you're doing today today over
talking that's not going to be an issue
now I guess if you're doing day-to-day
overclock
ultimately this board has features that
I just don't care about so I'm not going
to talk about the merits of the rest of
this motherboard but yeah the VR m4
recore VCC and I'm not impressed the
memory of erm is I have no complaints
all the supporting voltages really I
have no complaints v core VCC and could
definitely be stronger but you know it's
not like it's going to burn your house
down so that's it for this video like
