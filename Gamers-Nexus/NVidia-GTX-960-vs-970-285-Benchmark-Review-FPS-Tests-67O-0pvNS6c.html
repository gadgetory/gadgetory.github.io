dotnet and today we're talking about
this this is a new video card is the gtx
960 running the GM 206 GPU from nvidia
so this is a new nvidia card and i just
benchmarked it against everything the
Embargo just lifted it is available
online today but do check all of our
framerate results before you buy because
we take these tests very seriously and
conduct them all objectively and fairly
it has been tested against the 760 the
770 the 970 the r9 285 the r9 270x and
all those cards what you need to know
about this new video card is that it is
available for $200 MSRP this specific
card is the asus strix 960 which is the
one i tested it is available at $210
MSRP ZOTAC and EVGA both have
overclocking options already available
and both of those will be available at
about 200 bucks no more than 210 for
sure so that's sort of the price range
in terms of specs the gtx 960 reference
will have 2 gigabytes of RAM that is set
for all cards it will not exceed 2
gigabytes of RAM as it stands now in the
GM 206 you've got 8 SMS each one of
those hosts 128 CUDA cores and that
means you get a total of 1024 to two
cores for the whole thing
so while Kepler GPUs my out number the
coup de coeur account they are more
efficient because they're sharing a
greater pool of memory it's 92 kilobytes
versus 64 plus there's 24 kilobytes for
some other process you can read all
about it on the link in the description
below or on the annotation right now if
I put that up so that's the architecture
the effective memory speed is 93 hundred
megahertz after accounting for the
memory compression and delta color
correction and what both of those do is
effectively compress the data per frame
that you're storing in the frame buffer
that's the two gigabytes of video ram
you're compressing that data by about
25% it's using 25 fewer bytes per frame
so that's happening because of delta
color correction which is basically
looking temporally at a frame meaning
over time it looks at the previous frame
the next frame that's impending and it
says okay what colors have not changed
and then it doesn't fetch those again it
doesn't need to calculate those colors a
second time that saves you a lot of
memory bandwidth and that's true with
the 980 as well so this is not news to
anyone
the next major advancement for the 960
over the 760 is TDP which is a trend in
the industry right now even AMD has
caught on and TDP for the 960 is 120
watts it is capable of running games
like League of Legends and dota 2 and
Team Fortress 2 and generally low
requirements games at 30 watts that
means this does not need to run even its
fans in the case of the asus strix and
in the case of some of the other
impending devices from other
manufacturers so in this video cards
case the easiest rigs it will actually
spin down one or both fans depending on
the load of the GPU so if you're playing
League of Legends on this which is
really unnecessary to have this for the
League of Legends but if you're doing it
it will turn these fans off run at about
30 watts and you're saving a ton of
power and you're not really burning
you're not generating a lot of heat in
the system that the CPU will suck up
into its fan so good all around for the
entire system the most immediate
competitors to this card are going to be
AMD s r9 285 which is priced at about
the same price about 210 dollars and
there are nine to 80 which is about $180
below that you've got things like the
270x and things like that they're gonna
be outclassed by the gtx 960 in terms of
cards above this it's really on NVIDIA
side it's just the GTX 970
that's it that's all there is above this
unless you go way higher than that and
give the 980 so what does that mean that
means there's a gap between $200 for
this and about 300 350 dollars for 970
that is a massive gap that is a gap big
enough to drive a TI through so I am
expecting some sort of Ti in the future
there has been nothing in Ostia I'm not
being cheeky here we don't even have any
inside info so that's that's sort of
just speculation let's look at the
benchmarks to the GTX at 960 so in terms
of performance you can look at all of
our benchmark test methodology in the
link in the description below on the
article testing first with Metro last
light the GTX 960 got about 52 FPS
average and the r9 285 got about
see 5 FPS average they're very close
that's basically within margin of error
so they're effectively the same
performance for Metro last light and
that's a good thing because that means
this is a serious competitor to the r9
285 which yes it does outperforming by a
few frames but for about 70 watts
last TDP that's pretty good that's
that's very competitive looking at the
GTX 760 in Metro last light the 960
pretty handily outperforms the 760 so
this is actually a big jump from one
generation to the next in grid Autosport
again we see a slight advantage going to
the r9 285 which performs at about 80
fps and the gtx 960 performs about 78
FPS average these are both average
numbers and that is again within margin
of error it's like 2% difference so
pretty good but not quite a definitive
yes or no on whether you should buy this
card over the r9 285 in Far Cry 4 again
the GTX 960 performing at about 70 fps
and that's very handily outperforming
the GTX 760 which sits at about 53 fps
that is a huge difference from one
generation to the next that's more than
30 percent difference in fact and at
that it's actually becoming worthwhile
to upgrade from a 760 to a 960 but hold
on to your money generally you're going
to want to upgrade from something
earlier than a 760 because that's still
a pretty well performing card right now
unless you're really dying for 4 high
graphics in games and you don't have the
budget for more expensive card now this
is where the gtx 960 starts to show off
and put AMD to shame a little bit in
battlefield 4 on ultra settings maxed
out at 1080p the gtx 960 performed at
over 60 fps 63 and the r9 285 performed
at 53 FPS and this is a game that was
optimized with AMD it's one of the few
in fact that has been optimized recently
for andy's specifically by the developer
during the launch cycle nvidia sort of
sucks up all the other companies so that
is a big lead for the gtx 960 to carry
over the 285 in battlefield in
Assassin's Creed so unsurprisingly
because it has been optimized heavily
for
via the gtx 960 leads at 53 FPS over 48
fps
for the 285 and the 960 in some
instances will beat out these 770 I'll
throw a few more benchmarks up as I'm
closing out the video you can check all
of these charts in the link in the
description below including some that
are not shown here so do check those out
the gtx 960 then should you buy it it
really depends on the hole this is a
very impressive card when you're looking
at the TDP against the performance it
performs very well and it has a TDP of
120 watts which is lower than any other
card of this performance thus far and
it's priced at $200 that is a somewhat
threatening price to AMD and Vidya
already effectively dominates the upper
end of the market with the 970 and 980
that is almost unarguable and although
the price is good on the to 90 and 290x
those two cards are just the best period
so that leaves AMD owning the budget and
mid-range markets which they've always
done from the 265 up to the 280x 285 now
and there hasn't really been any
competition there for AMD that's where
the 960 comes in there's been no real
reason to buy 760 for a long time now
and the 750 Ti is great in its own right
it's very low TDP but it's still not as
good as say a 270 X or something like
that which is priced fairly similarly at
this point so the 960 shakes the market
up a lot it somewhat invalidates some of
AMD's nearby offerings and it is very
threatening to the 285 which performs
almost identically consumes 70 watts
more doesn't quite have the same level
of driver support and this is this is
something that people will argue with me
about in the comments I'm sure but
definitively Nvidia releases more
drivers more frequently and Andy's
gotten a lot better with it since Omega
don't get me wrong they've gotten way
better since Omega but there's there
some of that tinge in your mouth of bad
drivers in the past so at the end of the
day the GTX 960 is a very good card it
is worth buying if you're trying to
build a system in a mid-range price if
you're trying to build in a budget look
at the 272 270 X on
50 TI depending on your needs if you're
building an HCP see this is awesome if
you can afford a $200 card for an HCP
see because lo TDP low heat means that
you're not going to be overheating your
other components in a small case in
terms of the 285 it's worth considering
I would personally opt for a 960 in most
instances unless I really want that
extra couple of frames per second and
even then the difference between this
and the 285 is close enough that driver
updates between AMD and NVIDIA well I
mean they trade blows with each other
constantly so you're gonna see these two
cards battling it out and overtaking one
another they're effectively identical in
terms of fps so it just comes down to
the other things that you need and
whether those are worth one company or
another to you so that is the gtx 960
check on the description below for more
information you can find out where to
buy it in the article all that good
stuff please tweet at us if you have any
questions whatsoever if we get enough of
them I may do a roundup video and that
is all for this time I will see you all
next time peace
