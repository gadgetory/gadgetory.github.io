access Donna and today we are talking
about three utilities that are for
capturing your gameplay moments those
tools are fraps which you have likely
heard of GVR which is somewhat new and
Nvidia shadowplay let's talk about what
these three tools are then we'll look at
benchmark results in terms of which one
performs better for your video card and
talk about storage requirements fraps is
the oldest spend around for about 10
years
GPR is somewhat new it is built and
supported by rafter but is heavily
supported by AMD Nvidia shadowplay is
one year old as of May and is as far as
I know the first utility on the PC side
to introduce retroactive recording GVR
is also able to do this so the three
tools what are the pros and cons well
fraps record is almost entirely on the
CPU side meaning that your system will
be bound by the CPU it does a little on
the GPU but not much and it's going to
slam your FPS throughput in any game
you're playing
sometimes up to 50 percent or more which
means that you're going to need to drop
settings if you'd like to record
gameplay with fraps and not have huge
FPS spikes that is because it is more
CPU bound than the others and these GB
are and Nvidia's shadowplay or I should
say Raptors GB are are both utilities
that use the GPU to record the GPU is a
parallel processor unlike the CPU serial
processing and it also is specialized
for video capture and video output so
it's going to have an inherent advantage
when you couple a GPU with software
that's built to use it Nvidia and AMD
both have GPUs post 7900 series and post
Fermi meaning Kepler Maxwell which would
be 600 onward for NVIDIA their GPUs in
the series and onward use what is called
an encoder and h.264 video encoder AMD
calls it VCE it's a video codec
compliance and NVIDIA just calls it an
h.264 encoder because that's what it is
and this is a special subset of the die
the GPU die that it's only purpose in
life is to encode capture deal with
scale whatever you're doing h.264 video
playback which is exactly what the
capture is for games
and it's supposed to do that in an
isolated fashion from the rest of the
GPU meaning that your games will not
actually have a huge FPS impact in
theory because all of this recording is
being handled by a special little
processor in its own corner of the GPU
that should have no impact on gaming of
course nothing is a perfect system right
there's always some loss and we'll look
at that in a moment
fraps does it all in the cpu and suffers
as a result and also does not do any
live encoding it only records losslessly
in a raw format which means that you end
up with videos I'm not kidding that I
have about a 638 megabits per second
bitrate versus the 50 megabits per
second
adjustable of the Andy and add video
solutions and I talked about this in the
article length of the description below
if you are curious how this is
calculated and what it means in short
this video is about 20 18 to 20 megabits
per second
played in 1080p for a second look at the
gameplay on the screen look at grid or
metro or whatever I'm showing right now
it's pretty high quality so why would
you need 638 megabits per second well
really you don't and that's the end of
that let's look at the benchmarks first
looking strictly at an Nvidia device we
can see that with no capture software
present grid is producing a 113 FPS on
the 780 Ti and metro is producing a 76
FPS on the 780 Ti using shadow play we
lose a couple frames on each of these
one metro two and grid but it's with
almost within margin of error it's one
to two percent of frame loss meaning
that there's really not much reason not
to record your gameplay because it's
performing effectively the same as when
you're not recording but reason not to
record it is if you suck which is still
arguable because it produces funny
content as I have done or if you don't
have the storage requirement for more
video which I'll talk about in a moment
raptor is GVR is compatible with both
Nvidia and AMD devices it will perform
better on AMD because the AMD is
supporting Raptor in the creation of the
software but I tested it on both just
for sake of discussion you can see on
the Nvidia card here we are not looking
at AMD yet we dropped from 113 fps and
grid to 82 fps when recording gameplay
with GVR that is substan
but still not quite noticeable for most
users in Metro we drop from 76 fps to 68
again not very noticeable in fact less
than 10 frames per second and it's high
enough 60 is our baseline for
playability so high enough that is still
playable for apps we drop all the way to
61 fps and grid which is almost a 50%
drop in performance that is substantial
at this point you are modifying your
game settings in order to accommodate
your video recording habits so that
becomes an issue moving to AMD
I could not test shadow play on this
because it is incompatible but we look
at no capture and we're at around 103
fps for grid 81 for Metro with DVR
enabled we're keeping 94 FPS is very
simple math because look at the numbers
that is about a 90 percent retention
rate of your frames meaning you're
retaining almost all of your frames that
are produced while recording with DVR
just as Nvidia does with shadow play
pretty impressive especially for a new
solution by rafter and this remains true
with Metro looking at fraps once again
we have a 40-ish percent drop in total
performance that is pretty that's a
pretty big drop and it's going to be
it's kind of beat painful so you need to
drop your settings to accommodate this
and finally before moving to the storage
we're looking at performance degradation
from baseline at this point between AMD
and NVIDIA on the different solutions
what you see at none is a 100%
performance meaning all your frame is
delivered this is our baseline I had to
normalize and do Delta's because you
can't linearly compare video cards like
this without doing that so no matter
what you're going to lose performance
when you start recording no matter what
solution you're using so we go from a
hundred percent performance we drop down
to 98 point to one percent of all frames
delivered when using shadow play with an
Nvidia card that's crazy
98.21 percent is almost a perfect system
it's almost perfectly efficient which
means that you really have no reason not
to record and you might as well just
capture it and delete it if it sucks
Andie's gbr is still very good
especially considering it is basically
brand new it's something that Raptor and
AMD have worked on together recently it
retains ninety point eight six
of its performance and same as Nvidia
that's high enough that you're seeing
almost no noticeable frame dips
depending on the game you're playing
with an Nvidia solution on gbr it's
actually a very big hit it's it's more
than 30 percent FPS lost when using
gpiod record that is still far better
than fraps but you really might as well
use shadowplay
unless GVR offers something that
shadowplay does not that you need I
can't think of it though fraps is all
the way down to 47% on AMD and 40
percent of total performance on Nvidia
pretty big hit at this point fraps has
become somewhat invalidated other than
specific use case scenarios on CPU
driven systems on incompatible GPUs
benchmarking things like that storage
requirements fraps requires 95 70
megabytes that's 9.5 gigabytes of
storage for a 2 minute video which is
actually split into 3 files that's
because record 638 megabits per second
shadowplay and GVR require just under
over 700 megabytes for the same 2 minute
video which is very easy to move around
you don't even need to edit it you can
upload that straight to youtube if you
wanted to kind of big but not bad that's
at 50 megabits per second you can
manually decrease this to about 20 if
you are more reasonable human so the
conclusion here GPR is very impressive
shadowplay is extremely impressive and
fraps is sort of going away unless they
can update to take advantage of hardware
acceleration fraps is still useful in
certain use case scenarios that i
described in the article shadowplay and
gb are certainly have their limitations
but they're growing rapidly they're
backed by the two biggest and really
only video card vendors or GPU vendors I
should say in the DIY PC and gaming
market so look at both of these if
you're picking a GPU based on this
capability you should you should
probably read some of our other articles
because it is a bit more complex than
just this software stuff and that's all
for this video I will see you all next
