benchmark crossfire Rx for 70s for the
full rx for 70 review using this card
you can check our separate video on that
on the channel what we got in the mail
after the sapphire rx for 17 is a 4
gigabyte card was this MSI rx for 70 I
think it's another gaming X model yes
and this one is an 8 gigabyte card
it's clocked slightly differently it's
got more vram so these aren't a perfect
match in terms of what you might set up
for crossfire but we were able to do it
anyway and I'll talk about how and why
we set up the way we did so this test is
mostly going to be focusing on the
comparison between a single 470 and 2 4
70s we're not going to be going through
crazy look at every single card on the
bench type of thing they will be on
there but check the full review for more
information first off the card setup I
ran the Sapphire card in the top slot so
that for games that are not using
explicit multi-gpu which is basically
all games at this point except for
dashes for those games this is the card
that we'll be using
used for all the vram so it's a 4
gigabyte limit we're basically meeting
the least common denominator here so
this card is only going to be as good as
the Sapphire card despite the fact that
the MSI one does have more vram we're
not going to be tapping into it so that
is one note and consideration to make
they perform effectively the same as two
of these because we're limited to the
worst card but I do want to point that
out they're not they're not actually the
same card so that's something to note
for dx12 things are different to ashes
is a different benchmark we'll talk
about that later
first off let's look at power draw for
power draw we're looking at the parent
power draw in volt amps as measured at
the wall this means that we're looking
at power draw from the system level so
we're comparing Delta's between
configurations not between actual cards
the system power draw with a single rx
474 gigabyte card from sapphire the
Platinum Edition was measured at about
220 2 volt amps under full load with
idle at about 80 volt amps the rx 470
crossfire setup was consuming at 404
volt amps load
or eighty-three idol so definitely a
significantly higher power draw nearly
actually 2x the load power draw of a
single card and this is in step with
most multigp setups where you see the
most valid arguments for why power draw
matter for FPS benchmarking as always a
link in the description below if you
want to check this article with
potentially extra charts but definitely
extra test methodology explanation you
can read about the drivers we use the
system we use all that stuff but
otherwise the system used is on the
screen now and we use that for very
specific reasons you can read in the
article if you're curious let's look at
Metro last light first Metro last light
at 1080p with very high quality and high
tessellation post the performance output
of 109 FPS average on the crossfire RS
470 cards with a 70 point 7 fps 1% low
and 64 FPS 0.1% low for comparison the
RX 470 single card performs at 70 point
3 FPS average so we're about 30 to 40
lower and that's a difference of forty
two point six percent that puts the RX
470 crossfire cards at the level of
performance achieved by a gtx 980ti
not too far from a 1070 and really close
to the RX 4 80s in crossfire
interestingly RX 4 70s in crossfire
somewhat invalidate the argument for RX
4 80s in crossfire with this particular
game and those four eight is word by the
way tested with 8 gigabyte models and
let's just look at more results before
reaching a definitive conclusion though
at 1440p for metro we're seeing an
output of 81 FPS average for the
crossfire for 70s with a 56.7 fps 1% low
and forty six point seven FPS 0.1% low
for a comparison the single RX 470
performs at 47 FPS there is a positive
scaling and that's not always the case
the crossfire for 80s are at 89 FPS
average a difference of 9 percent
against the RX 4 70s in crossfire and a
single gtx 1070 is still outperforming
the crossfire RX 4 70s that was a
crossfire config does markedly outpace a
gtx 1060 our previous Mirror's Edge
catalyst multi-gpu test showed negative
scaling for
the crossfire rs4 80s and we're still
seeing negative scaling with the
crossfire 4 70s though not as fiercely
as the original crossfire testing showed
still it's better to disable crossfire
for Mirror's Edge catalyst the crossfire
Rx for 70s are posting 65 FPS average
with 44 fps 1% lows and about 31 fps
0.1% lows for comparison the single rx
470 performed at 65 point 3 FPS average
44.7 FBS 1% low and 31 fps 0.1% lows so
the configurations are effectively
identical and this has improved at least
over the original crossfire 480
benchmark or we saw really negative
scaling but it's still not positive so
you'd still be best to say when
crossfire for optimal performance
scallion is mostly the same or the lack
thereof anyway at 1440p with the duel
cards output in 41 FPS average 28 200
and a stuttery basically unplayable 19
fps 0.1 drusen below the single card
pushes 42 29 and 19.7 so we're again
effectively the same GTA 5 was a
nightmare with crossfire with the 16
point 8.1 drivers these resolve the
single our X 480 stuttering issues over
16 62 and we saw it still intense micro
stutter that nukes performance with the
crossfire 470 set up the same issue is
not present on a single 470 when tested
including the single Platinum Edition
that we have here in our crossfire
config but introducing crossfire does
basically break the output and the issue
by the way is what you've been looking
at on the screen if you're curious and
obviously paints a picture of an
unplayable game this is also exactly why
we test for 1% in 0.1% lows because
they're an accurate depiction of those
swings here's the raw data for a few
test passes just the crossfire cards and
the RX 470 card on the screen now you
can see the variance with the crossfire
configuration is tremendous and the lows
are dipping really hard when they do dip
and just to reiterate the point we
sometimes have folks comment and
challenge the use of the word unplayable
when referring to high average frame
rates for example this output even at a
93 FPS average is completely unplayable
but you've got to look beyond the
average because if
look Jessa the average it looks actually
pretty good looking at the low metrics
we can understand why and it's the
stutter and micro stutter in this case
that we can show in the video capture
regardless the normal chart shows that
1080p GTA 5 operates at about 97 FPS
average with 1% lows of 39 fps and 0.1%
lows of 24 the single rx 470 pushes 77
average but has lows of 54 and 48
genuinely playable with the single card
here's the interesting thing with its
high average GTA 5 would actually show
some reasonable scaling if and the order
to work out the drivers to properly
support crossfire which will probably
happen in the next update but
performance is there it's just the frame
throughput is to stutter II we were not
able to get dooms at Vulcan update
running on the crossfire cards this time
the screen just went black has never
really been well supported anyway but
the crossfire cards did technically run
with OpenGL I say technically because
performance is mostly identical to a
single card with very slight negative
scaling for the low values though not in
a substantial way or generally
noticeable fashion right about 75 to 76
FPS average for both the single and dual
GPU setups the same is true for 1440p by
the way with scaling at near zero and a
frame rate of 52 51 FPS average the lows
are pretty similar but favoring the
single GPU the division also has
negative scaling with crossfire and
we're looking at about 64 FPS average
for the CF RX 4 70s with lows in the 30s
while the single card outputs 71 FPS
average and a 48 fps 0.1% lows and
that's the biggest improvement here and
that's about the same as what we saw
with the rx for 80s and crossfire for
positive scaling we have to look at
games like Metro last light and black
ops and GTA 5 though GTA did have that
micro stutter is so you really can't
count it right now you could also look
at shadow of mordor and some of the
other games but we didn't retest that
title here and so we reach the same
conclusion as previously with multi-gpu
setups just generally they're not that
reliable for a wide berth of games if
you're playing a very specific game that
does scale well one game that you're
playing regularly then it's worth
considering if it's a good value
proposition versus a more powerful
single card but even then you're still
looking at the power argument the noise
arguments not so bad depending on which
cards you buy but the power argument
certainly is and we've shown that it's
nearly a 2x increase 1.8 X if you're
just doing it linear anyway but 1.8 X
over the original power draw so 220 to
bold amps apparent power draw for a
single card configuration versus the 400
plus load with the two cards that's
certainly an argument worth considering
and at least some instances maybe not
everyone cares
but really it's a it's a small market
segment where multigp is for gaming it
makes sense it's the same thing we've
said friend video this is an exclusive
to crossfire in AMD it's the same for
SLI with SLI ten seventies we reach the
ultimate conclusion of it's really not
worth it you're better off buying a
single card in some production
applications you could make this
argument because maybe if you're doing
something OpenCL accelerated in this
case for cuda accelerated an invidious
case the argument could be made for
software like blender or premier if it
supports multi GPU render then you might
actually see a benefit in that
application and you could potentially
get benefit in a few of the games you
play as well just go into it knowing
that you're occasionally the minimum
going to be disabling crossfire the most
interesting takeaway here if we're going
to take something away is that the
crossfire Rx for 70s in some games
perform actually in most games perform
really close in terms of frame rate
output to the Rx for 80s so by
performing as closely as they do it
almost really invalidates the argument
of crossfire rx for 80s we didn't
recommend those either just like we
didn't recommend as I said any of the
other multi-gpu setups for gaming
general use cases but if you were to buy
one and you're looking at crossfire for
ATS I would say also consider the option
of four 70s because you drop your price
a little bit if you really want that set
up it's let's let's kind of just assume
for sake of ease that the price of these
is somewhere around $190 I know it's all
over the map right now but let's assume
it settles there for a semi-decent card
you're looking at something like three
hundred eighty bucks for two of them and
if you do two for 80s
at least a gigabyte models anyway then
you're looking at something like five
hundred of course if you do the four
gigabyte model then you encounter the
same thing we talked about in our 470
review which is the pricing is so close
in some instances that is it's just it's
really weird the market is strange right
now and you can watch our previous
videos for that but basically the price
argument is potentially here for these
cards if you really want to do crossfire
if not don't because it's not worth it
get a single card instead that's all
there is to say so patreon like the post
