donna and today we're talking about
voltage ripple as it pertains to power
supplies overclocking and component
longevity this is something we've
already published on the website it was
written by Michael Kern's one of our
writers and that talks about what
voltage ripple is and how it impacts
those two factors but we're going to
dive into it a little bit more here for
the YouTube audience so first of all
what is voltage ripple voltage ripple is
the fluctuation of the voltage supply
down each of your three main lines of
power your rails so your 12 volt your 5
volts and your 3.3 volt are not
perfectly 12 5 &amp;amp; 3.3 volts if you read
them out with an oscilloscope in fact
the voltage of each of these different
lines of power we'll talk specifically
about 12 volt because it goes to the GPU
CPU things like that the power supplied
the voltage supplied down the 12 volt
line is not going to be perfectly twelve
point zero volts if you read it out with
an accurate instrument like an
oscilloscope or an otoscope you'll see
that it might fluctuate between for
example twelve point one twelve point
one four it might drop down and this is
called voltage ripple so this is the
amount of fluctuation in the waveform
peak to peak between the voltage levels
as the voltage is continuously supplied
to whatever it's going to and there's an
ATX specification for power supplies
this is the spec to which all power
supplies sold in the consumer market
must abide there's a much stricter
server spec that is really not something
you'll encounter in general in the
consumer market so let's look at the ATX
spec the specification for ATX power
supplies for voltage ripple is that they
must be less than 120 millivolts so you
should see a fluctuation
no greater than 120 millivolts down any
of your 12-volt rails the specification
for 3.3 and 5 volts is 50 millivolts so
there should be no greater than 50
millivolts the fluctuation in those
instances but some higher-end power
supplies will target 60 millivolts of
fluctuation which is pretty darn good
and that's actually what
Michael Kern's myself included we both
kind of look for power supplies in that
range when we're buying because we do a
lot of enthusiast stuff like overclock
and you want to make sure you have a
very consistent voltage supply when
you're dealing with any kind of very
volatile components which is what
happens in overclocking so that's what
voltage ripple is it's the fluctuation
of voltage down the supply it's very
normal it's not something you can really
have down to zero especially in the
consumer market so you're always going
to have some voltage ripple it's just a
matter of how much and this impacts two
main things as I've mentioned it impacts
component longevity and it impacts the
overclocking stability so if component
longevity that is impacted because
voltage ripple will increase the demand
on the B RMS and the power supply itself
to regulate the voltage supply and it
also increases the heat of capacitors as
capacitors heat up they are more prone
to popping to failure and just leakage
or damage over time so there is a an
electro electrical engineering rule that
states that for every 10 degrees Celsius
drop in thermals the capacitor should be
expected to double its life span if
we're talking about a non solid
electrolytic capacitor which is a fairly
common type of capacitor on the higher
end components you will see solid
capacitors slightly different rules
apply but that's the general idea so
less heat is very good for capacitors
helps them live longer and a healthier
power supply means healthier components
receiving the power so that's the the
heat issue the component longevity issue
if you have more voltage ripple you're
putting your devices the power supply
especially and the receiving devices the
BRM all of that goes through more strain
when trying to make the fine-tuned
adjustments to keep your system running
stable and then on the overclock inside
we have a slightly different concern so
let's take an example say your GPU at a
strictly hardware level electrically
requires 1.2 1 2 volts this is somewhat
standard for some architectures so this
is not the voltage that you're
overclocking software says that you are
providing this is the voltage that the
GPU says it
it's on electrical level purely Hardware
level now let's step it back so now
we're looking at the software if you
start overclocking and you need to
supply more voltage then you increase
the voltage increment in your
overclocking software that much we know
the amount that it is incremented will
depend on a lot of things we're gonna
forget about most of them for now but
the the one we're talking about here is
a voltage ripple so if the ripple is 50
millivolts which is very reasonable then
you will have to as a user effectively
add in an extra 50 millivolts of
overhead of room for fluctuation in the
supply of voltage to the GPU because
what happens is if you dip down below
what the GPU needs electrically because
of voltage ripple or really because of
anything you'll exhibit instability and
you'll see instability in the system
you'll see driver crashing flickering
black screens stuff like that stuff
we've all discussed in our various
articles on the website on gamers nexus
net currents and I have both talked
about this so that's where the
overclocking impact is that's why you
want a good power supply you want
something that can eat the extra load
and supply some stability to your system
there's a lot more to power supply
selection than this so if you are
curious about power supplies how they
work what the other specs me and what
active PFC is and stuff like that check
the website we have a specs dictionary
it is at the top in the menu and you'll
find a PSU dictionary in there we define
several of these we're adding more
definition soon and then the voltage
ripple article is already live on the
site so that's the basics of voltage
ripple why it is important and how it
can impact your system we do of course
recommend high quality power supplies
but it's not always possible and for
budget reasons it's not always within
budget so it is not the end of the world
if you can't afford $100 power supply
but even when you're looking at the low
end you do want kind of a bottom line of
how low you're willing to go and how low
quality you are willing to accept so do
consider a my overclocking am i planning
to use the system for a very long time
and other factors like that how much
to spend how much efficiency do you need
and that will all help in determining
how much he should really budget toward
a power supply if you are doing extreme
overclocks
definitely consider a higher end power
supply because you need that stability
so that's all for this time at check out
our forthcoming ask a GN video we've
been doing these lately so there's a
power supply discussion on there
actually where we talk about the wattage
supply to components so that's all for
this time hit the patreon link in the
post role of this video if you like our
content and want to support us we're up
to nine backers now so as I keep saying
start and small but it's helping us with
removing some of our dependency on the
regular advertising of the industry so
that lets us keep doing some more free
of criticism for manufacturers content
which I know you all enjoy I will see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
