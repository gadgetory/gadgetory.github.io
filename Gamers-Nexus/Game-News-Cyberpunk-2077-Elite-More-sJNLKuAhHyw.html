Nexus dotnet and this is your game news
recap for the week we're talking about
the witcher cyberpunk 2077 steam account
theft overwatch space Sims and more for
this week if you're here for Hardware
news check the channel for weekly recap
on that side of the industry we're
starting off with the witcher and its
future polish developers CD Projekt RED
recently known for their efficient
management of an 81 million dollar
budget to create witcher 3 this week
announced a renewed focus on the white
wolf series Gerald's story concluded
with the Wild Hunt the third game but CD
PR was quoted as saying it wouldn't be
fair to fans and to quote forget about
this brand CD Projekt RED see Oh Adam
catch in skeet old polish site money PL
that 2016 would be quote devoted to the
witcher thanks to the game's profound
sales success anyone excited about the
company's cyberpunk 2077 a game that has
remained a development purgatory for
years now knows the reason why external
marketing has stayed silent the CD PR
team wants to make moves on its next
phase of planning for The Witcher before
announcing a release target on cyberpunk
2077 catch in ski noted that an internal
release target has been set for
cyberpunk but that team won't reveal
until the witcher has fully been tapped
for its monetization potential
interestingly the public focus on
monetization and budget management has
become increasingly fortifying for CD
projekt red's image the company has
managed to create multiple best-selling
hits in the past few years off and on
budget severely limited in comparison to
industry colleagues in other news this
week's team posted a message encouraging
users to opt into the systems double
authentication security protocol valve
stated that more than 77,000 accounts
are hijacked each month in what it
describes as organized crime the company
seems to think that completely stopping
this mass theft is unrealistic instead
opting to make it more difficult for
account thieves by instituting new
security measures one of the measures is
a trade hold which freezes traded items
items for a period of time before
completing the transaction this gives
rightful account holders the brief
opportunity to reclaim the account and
item prior to its removal from account
inventory vows blog explains that steam
trading is the hub of account theft
hijacked accounts will trade away items
to other accounts
then still more than more until
eventually they get sold to a legitimate
user this is effectively laundering
money but in a much dirtier digital way
even though we're talking about video
games here and not criminally obtained
real world money valve items hold
massive value some CSG o knives can sell
for a thousand dollars or more making
accounts holding such items a big target
for hijackers valve states that it will
continue to help users and restoring
lost items and accounts but also said
that quote that doesn't deter the
business of hacking accounts it's only
going to get worse so what can you do
about this opting into the steam guard
mobile Authenticator is the first thing
to do this also removes the trade hold
let's move back to news that specific to
game's elite dangerous horizons the new
expansion released for a space sim game
that revisits the 1980s franchise we
already benchmarked the game last year
but it's changed massively since initial
launch and is worth a series of look by
anyone who hasn't yet considered it a by
elite dangerous doesn't have as large a
scopus star citizen and is already
playable providing a worthy space sim
into more hands around no man's sky and
star citizen alike horizons adds
planetside exploration for billions of
star systems as buggy driving on created
out services and as mechanical
complexity to the game's already
existing features players who don't much
care for planetside exploration may
instead be interested in the new dog
fighting arena similar to the concept of
the arena commander module for star
citizen the dog fighting arena provides
a single point of conflict for players
to engage in high-speed ship-to-ship
combat horizons is already out and
available for elite dangerous owners a
new weapon was added to valve's counter
strike global offensive earlier this
week the r8 revolver has been the center
of controversy as the weapon has found
its way into loadouts mostly caught out
for effectively eliminating the need to
purchase any other weapon its sheer
power allows for one shot kills with
great efficiency and cost benefit this
also makes ego rounds less difficult to
overcome for losing teams empowering
them in a way that immediately thrust
them back into competition the r8
revolver is currently bugged in
purchasing it's listed as eight hundred
fifty dollars purchased in the games
menu but can be had for seven hundred
valve will probably nerf the weapon in
the next update we've been
discussion with blizzards engine team
this week about overwatch and its
graphics engine hopefully with a ton of
new data that we can reveal as the game
nears completion until that time we're
still waiting for Blizzard to continue
its push through beta stages Blizzard
recently said that it hopes to add new
heroes and maps as free content not DLC
which seems like a good fusion with the
somewhat unexpected payment model
overwatch unlike other current team
shooters is a game you pay for one time
than begin playing free content
distribution sounds good to us closing
as office Epic Games Paragon a game that
was teased a few weeks ago with
effectively zero supporting information
of substance following continued teasers
of in Game Heroes improving our initial
predictions correct that big this week
unveiled at Paragon is an mo ba running
on the Unreal Engine 4 Paragon is
supposedly pushing for high fidelity
graphics and more realism than other mo
bas but still brandishes the superhero
esque vibe of hero types will continue
following this game as more is revealed
that's all for this week's game news
