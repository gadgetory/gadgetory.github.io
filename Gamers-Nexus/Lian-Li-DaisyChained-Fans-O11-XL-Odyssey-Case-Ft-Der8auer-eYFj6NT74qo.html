Computex 2019 and we've got a couple of
cool things there's some cases of course
but probably the most interesting thing
for a lot of you is going to be a total
prototype right now and this is just
connecting fans so you can daisy-chain
them and eliminate all of the cables in
between so I think and we'll need your
feedback below I think this is probably
one of the more interesting products
just because kill management as the RGB
craze has grown has become a very
difficult challenge so we'll be talking
about this today I'll apologize now for
the echo apparently we're in an
auditorium but we'll walk through this
there's the 11 dynamic XL that a lot of
you have asked about and then there's a
halo product case called The Odyssey
before that this video is brought to you
by the gigabyte Z 390 ARS master
motherboard which comes equipped with
one of the more powerful Z 390 BRS for
heavier overclocks on the new 9th Gen
Intel CPUs the ARS master is also one of
the few motherboards with a really heat
sink this generation featuring a mix of
high surface area fins and looks
oriented hover blocks oh and it's also
got updated our Divi illumination learn
more at the link below so for the fans
these are our concept unis and it's
theirs there's no roadmap right now
there's no price and this is total
prototype phase this is the third
prototype it took about two weeks from
pen to paper to now to get these made
and the outer materials cnc'd but I
guess the more important part to know is
that in between these two fans or maybe
a better example the three spinning back
here it's just one set of pins so they
just sock it together and it's not pin
to pin or pins a pad contact like the
eleven dynamic XL is but its socket all
pins in between and you can see there's
one cable set over here that goes to an
external hub and the the fan hub is then
powered separately right now by a power
supply so which addresses a few a few
future concerns like how much power can
you really drive through one connector
with you know from a motherboard so that
that's not an issue if it's externally
powered which this is but these are
connected in the middle the wire routes
outside within the frame such protected
I'll go ahead and note a few things the
LEDs are really not that important right
now
this entire design can change so it's
it's really just a prototype
and I want to highlight this heavily
because Leeanne Lee unlike a lot of the
other companies goes out of its way to
show complete prototype products and the
concern a lot of the big companies have
with that is that if they show you a
prototype then you'll just hate it
because it's not done yet
so give it a give it a chance because
really the only thing being demoed here
is the lack of the cabling the LEDs can
change and it really needs to go through
some more testing and refinement for
like the amount of connection cycles
those pins can sustain stuff like that
so what Lee and Lee needs to know from
you is are you interested in something
like this because I suppose the theory
is if you have as with a lot of the Arg
be fans nowadays you have two cables for
a fan and you're running three fans to
one radiator for example now you're
looking at six cables which is an awful
lot so this reduces that significantly
it reallocates them a bit to the back of
the case but you do eliminate some of
the cabling and end up wiring it within
the fans instead so it's out of the way
and I guess that's if it's affordable
it's a good solution for cutting down on
the excessive cabling for RGB and it's
just kind of cool and we have b-roll of
these socketing together they just slide
together so complete prototype no
roadmap at present but let let me know
what you think about this below and as
for the rest for this one I think it's
been connected up to six fans at least
right now and in terms of being able to
sustain the connection the power through
that many fans and beyond that it's
probably not super relevant anyway
because I don't know any radiators that
are that size 120 millimeter at present
once things are working if they can't
get to be working it could be expanded
and I think that covers concept unit so
that's all the more interesting ones
let's move on to I'll just quickly note
these we covered these at CES previously
and not a ton has changed but they've
been finalized so these are closed-loop
liquid coolers the pricing is the final
bit we didn't know what that was at CES
so to 40-millimeter see LCS are going to
land at about $110 and they are going to
be called Galahad so Galahad 240s for
these for some I guess Arthurian legends
references well skip your Bower stuff we
don't care about him he'll be in a
different video
we do care about him enough apparently
for this which is an 11 dynamic and this
case has gotten a lot of coverage from
us we actually were still using it at
home but though 11 dynamic Excel is one
that was shown at CES as well it's been
more finalized now for example there
Bowers name is shoved in the back corner
which is great because I can't stand
that guy I mean he's just man he's just
really good at overclocking and it
drives me crazy so Roman was involved on
this case heavily for the O 11 dynamic
the original one this is a scaled up
version and we liked that well Evan
dynamically performs pretty damn well
I'll go ahead and give the recap of it
if you missed the original dynamic
coverage despite this being a glass
front there is side intake so that makes
up for the lack of front intake very
well thermals even when air cooled were
good on the original 11 dynamic I don't
know how all that scales up to this but
it really is just primarily a scaled up
version with some improvements so it
should in theory the thermals should
also scale of a bit as cases grow and
the distance between the fan to the
cooler also grows then you have some
pressure loss but overall should be fine
and Roman did a fantastic job on the
original so if you wanted a larger
version there it is
as for the changes where the fans mount
on the side there are now some SSD sleds
so those will come with the case you can
remove them if you don't want them and
if you're not going to be putting fans
on that side that as this D sleds are
there you could put them on display
instead and then run your radiator to
the top or to the bottom so there's a
bit more space now we're in the original
it was so tight that you start doing
bottom mounted stuff you run into the
motherboard not an issue with this
version of the case other than this
there is also a pre routed set of cables
in the back for the SSDs or hard drive
so that's kind of neat there's SATA and
power pre routed back there which just
is another cable management feature the
case should be about $200 once finalized
should be launched in probably
july-august area so end of July is what
we're being told right now could change
and then I guess another small change
i've got noted usb on the bottom if you
really care about that otherwise a RGB
LEDs are also present when they were not
not previously present so that's the 11
dynamic Excel a lot of you have asked
about it you've got a timeline now
you've got a price and I guess if you
just wanted a bigger 11 dynamic there it
is we'll try and look at that one and do
a full review see if anything's really
changed thermally I think it's mostly
gonna be a feature review though on the
new new features to it because most of
its going to be the same in terms of
just structural integrity and I guess
more aluminum is that accurate more
aluminum as well now so the material
quality or material type has changed
this case land cool too we reviewed the
land cool one previously it kind of has
the the look of it in the same line
steel front panel land cool has
traditionally been a bit more on the
affordable side which this one is as
well Leanne Lee is looking at pricing
this may be in the range of $90 or just
under around 100 there's a few
interesting things we'll have to show
most of it and b-roll but the front
panel is a pin contact so you can pull
that off and you see the LEDs cut out so
a set of pins and pads there's the pads
there's the pins it makes it very easy
to to connect without cables which seems
to be a trend here today kill management
changes the front has actually a pretty
neat design for the fans so we'll show
b-roll of this - I'm not going to change
it right now but this pulls out you can
flip it around and the difference is it
just allows you to sort of change how
close the fans are to the panel ideally
you want the fans to be basically just
up against the panel for the best
pressure so you have higher static
pressure to pull air in through
especially where you have some limited
venting on it so you want them generally
closer but if you were doing something
like mounting the radiator or had some
other special project in mind then being
able to flip it and move them away from
the front of the chassis is really not a
bad feature to have so that's the the
fan bracket for that the front panel has
two small air intakes on the left and
the right I guess in total it's probably
about maybe like 30 to 40% of the width
of the front panel although then you
lose some with with the cutouts these I
thought well I'll point this out the
front panel is obviously a prototype
right now - so it's taped over that's
not final these not necessarily final
either but that's the current approach
the dust filtration so that may change
but
the front panel is is really gonna make
or break the airflow on it as always
internally this is where it gets kind of
more unique so let's just pull down yes
magnet very strong magnet okay try not
to break families prototypes today so
door swings out and you've got another
door down here the hard drive cages are
located here and these shift really
easily from the front to the back
although I think they're currently
screwed in but the hard drive cages move
on a set of rails not that unique we've
seen that of course before but there's
still some changes being made like how
accessible that screw is down there's
the screw currently you kinda have to
pull that out too to move it but still
in prototype phases there there's a
small cutout for air here which being
let's see depending on how close the GP
is to the bottom of the case or if you
amount of fan in the bottom on top of
the power supply shroud because there
are two fan mounts there for 120 s that
that air intake might do something we'd
have to test it though
the other side has the same method of
opening it's got two doors on it and I
think beyond that we'll just have to
keep an eye on it for final development
and and where the case goes but 90 bucks
but today one of the the cheaper cases
in the class that lis only makes the fan
count is still in question so I suppose
what we would be curious to hear is do
you expect the case like this to come
with fans or would you rather be a bit
cheaper and buy your own fans because
that's that's that's the toss-up
nothing's really changed here t-150 so
this was at CES the the changes that
this handle is now finalized and works a
bit better if you wanted a mini ITX box
and wanted to have a handle on it then
that's the enclosure I'll point you to
the CES video though if you want to see
what this is because we covered it
pretty well there and then the last
product is the Odyssey which is going to
take the most time to cover so we'll
move over to that one next everyone so
now Roman is joining me and he overheard
me talking about him earlier came in the
room and threatened it was quite scary
actually
so Rowan's got a channel there Bauer
it's not the correct pronunciation
that's correct
are you sure partially okay dear Bauer
is a channel
and he checked on the link below he's
gonna work on rearranging this case it's
barely complicated by the looks of it
but it's the Odyssey for the name of
case it's a prototype we don't have a
price yet this is a halo product it will
be expensive
I guess I'll I'll put it there I mean
like look at the case more expensive
then it'll be more expensive than
average let's start I don't know what's
I guess I'll explain the basics while
you start with this the case has two
primary or two only configurations
there's this one where it's standing and
you've got a long ways up and then this
layout where we've already removed all
the panels and so it obviously it just
flips the chassis it rotates it this is
not the same as the SI 700 PE or C's
homeowner damn where the entire case
kind of inverts and flips the c7 RP when
we worked with Coolermaster at PAX took
like almost I don't know an hour and a
half to two hours to do the full
reassembly and Roman claims he can do
this and maybe like 15 minutes or
something we're not gonna film the whole
process because frankly I don't believe
him but it should be pretty quick
in theory the cool things though I guess
that will point out the paneling is one
very heavy and two it bends so to bypass
one of the biggest limitations in
tempered glass that we talked about in
our tempered glass factory tours which
is curving the glass
Leon Lee is just going with two sheets
and then you bend it and you end up with
either like on this one where it's bent
out or you get the flat panels like the
one I just picked up so it's kind of an
interesting gimmick I guess for the case
and bypasses again low yields on curved
glass where some of the curved glass
panels in the industry are like 30% a
year old which skyrockets the price what
are you doing right now
so just removing the the main of the two
main parts so he'll take off the the top
cover basically typically its hold on by
I think ten screws but I removed some of
them first right make it a little bit
shorter yeah yeah and the same goes for
the mainboard tray it basically is just
slides into the case it's also very very
simple did you work on this case at all
I gave some Rebecca yeah actually we
started talking about this on CES when
he had the first like drawings and
drafts and then we discussed some like
special features like replacing or make
those changes so you can rotate them for
a better airflow or different visuals
stuff like that yeah okay basic inputs
and so what you have to do is you remove
those two parts and then basically you
just flip the case around you can see
where the the feet are mounted currently
you have to cut out for the for a button
so it just a front panel yeah for the
front panel button here so you just
remove this this one put it here remove
those feet let them put them on here mmm
mount this on the bottom and mount the
mainboard tray back on top where the
other part was located so it's actually
very very simple well if you didn't need
to do it yeah we said earlier how many
engineers does it take to remove it
because first when we try it first on
this prototype we couldn't get it out
yeah because it was kind of stuck to
those and you're like hmm then Mary
pointed out maybe you have to slide it
up oh yeah so a motherboard tray with
giant cutout and then I guess I mean
it's two configurations like ultimately
this is not some highly complex every
panel as modular case like the chassis
is still the chassis is still all
riveted yeah the mainframe is still the
same and then you have those two pen
parts that go on top that basically
fixed the glass lights to make them
angled that's not included on this case
right now so that's right cannot really
make that but you can imagine it if you
just apply an aluminum pegs I think the
aluminum just pegs for the other for the
panel mounting which we actually saw
being made at the Leon the factory last
year not for this panel but the same
type of peg so it makes it a bit easier
to install but yeah I mean I guess
that's really the most of what we can
say goes there's no price right now the
release is maybe towards the end of the
year so it sounds like towards August
potentially and it's clearly a halo
product let us know what you think of it
in the comments and
I think after this Rome and I are going
to do a video on one of his new products
yeah
also if you have any feedback obviously
leave it in the comments Leon D is
always open for suggestions questions
whatever Leone is probably one of the
most approachable company yes for cases
yeah exactly yeah so leave those below
