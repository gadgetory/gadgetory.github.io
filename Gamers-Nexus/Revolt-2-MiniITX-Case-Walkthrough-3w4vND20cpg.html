dotnet and today we're doing a quick
overview of I powers a new revolt - case
and system build the full review of this
won't be until after CES which is next
week but I wanted to show it off early
because it was just officially announced
today the main thing with this case is
that it's obviously Mini ITX and the GPU
faceplate and SSD plate are both exposed
so there's this acrylic panel that opens
and closes right here we can open that
up and you'll see the GP faceplate
exposed which is illuminated by RGB LEDs
and those are smart LEDs or smart
lighting as I've a power calls it which
is controlled through software so you
control the RGB LEDs just like the hue
plus or any other number of other LED
solutions the face plates for the SSD is
exposed and then on the inside is where
things get interesting from a thermal
standpoint this is what I'm most excited
to test in the immediate future
so for cooling with our setup this is
customizable on their site but with our
setup it's the top of the line build
with a 980ti hybrid which is a liquid
cooled 980ti and then the H 55 CLC is
cooling the CPU and we're told and this
is a very good thing by the way that the
revolt 2 will require a CLC on the CPU
that's a good thing because at this form
factor using any kind of ultra small air
cooler even though it might fit will not
really yield great results because it's
just too tight for air to work
efficiently and that's where liquid
comes in
so the radiators are mounted on the
bottom of this case there's a very tiny
amount of room on the bottom for air
intake or exhaust in this case I would
power pre-installed the system with the
radiator fans pulling air up so they're
actually on the the radiators on the
bottom fans on top of that and the
Fantas point air up through the radiator
which to anyone who's installed leaving
coolers before it may seem like a sub
optimal setup and that's something we
asked them about it is apparently the
best cooling setup for this particular
build that we're running and I'll
obviously validate that myself as the
time comes to test everything but that's
what we're told it's the best way to
cool it the power supply has its
and facing the motherboard and that
should help with the chipset thermals
chipsets get pretty hot in these tight
MITx SFF builds and that pulls air from
the board shoots it out the back as a
power supply normally does the video
card in this case nihti hybrid is using
liquid cooling for the GPU and then a
blower fan for the vrm and vram which is
ideal for exhausting air at the back
blower fans which are found on the
reference designs push air exclusively
at the back whereas the push fans will
sort of dissipate it through the the
case which is fine if you're running a
mid tower or a bigger case but in this
instance you really don't want to be
exhausting your heat into the rest of
the components just too tight there's
not enough exhaust intake setup because
the components are constricting all the
airflow so it's a very unique thermal
challenge and for that reason I'm
excited to test it the default
configuration is definitely a fun one to
test but I do want to change the fan
setup and see if we can make it work
even better so that's the revolt 2 case
right now there's no real pricing as of
yet I can tell you that we know this
build cost just under $2,000 that is
with an i7 6700 K the 980ti hybrid which
is pretty expensive card to begin with
seven hundred dollars or so sixteen
gigabytes of ddr4 ram the 240 gigabytes
a data SSD and then your other usual
components like an 850 watt power supply
in this case so that's the revolt 2
there's more information on the website
link in description below if you want to
see some photos you'll find those there
as well benchmarks thermals gaming FPS
benchmarks are all forthcoming and this
case just to answer the obvious question
as we understand it right now will not
be available separately which is
something that I really hope changes I
hope our power does actually look into
selling this separately because assuming
the thermals work out well which we
don't know that they will yet but
assuming all is well with the thermals
the design is definitely unique and the
layout is is pretty tight in terms of
efficient management of space for an SFF
build so it does make it suited for a
living room environment where you might
want a more showy system I
with an acrylic panel to show off your
face plate on the video card or SST or
what have you so it could make a good
box for DIY builders which is what most
of us are but in the meantime it is
being sold exclusively with the
ibuypower pre-built systems and we'll
see how how things change if at all in
the future so that is all for this time
thank you for watching hit the links in
the description below for more
information
patreon link for the post roll video if
you want to help us out and again the
full benchmark will be after CES so
subscribe for that if my blunder there
did not throw you off from the
subscription thank you for watching I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
