cosmos lineage but has some new designs
that attempt to modernize a case once
fit for the Super Tower market
integrated RGB LEDs and the top and
bottom panels are part of this as this
is the decision to opt for tempered
glass but new features also make an
appearance modularity for instance
creates an inverted or rotated layout
for stack effect cooling or just for
inversion and our present solutions and
modernizing that design this is also
painstakingly slow to execute but it
gives you something different the
shrouds are also fully present now as
you plank all ugly aspects of the case
and an abundance of filters also fit the
modern case design requirements before
getting to that this video is brought to
you by synergy the software that lets
you share a keyboard and mouse between
multiple systems if you have limited
desk space and multiple computers to
command synergy removes the need for
separate peripherals or a KVM and works
as over the network software use our
link below to get 50% off the home or
provision with SSL so we kind of already
reviewed this case when we did our PAX
West build but now we have more home
base opinions on it we have some thermal
numbers noise numbers things like that
and before we get any further I want to
point out if the lighting is a little
bit different from normally if it seems
like this side has less light hitting me
then you're used to its because this
case is so massive that we can't really
reasonably get the lights to shine over
it from that corner this thing is huge
so it's one of the biggest cases we've
worked with lately perhaps rivaling the
Vue 71 the be quiet dark based pro 900
white Edition if we put all three of
those cases right here you wouldn't be
able to see me so it's big
in fact it's so big that Coolermaster
wasn't sure how big it was when the case
first launched their website listed the
weight as about 57 pounds or 26.2
kilograms
presently they've updated the site it's
now 48 to 50 pounds somewhere in there
so regardless of which size you take
it's heavy and maneuvering the stain
while building is one of the big
challenges but fortunately you only have
to build in a case once normally so not
the biggest problem and people who want
this kind of case know what they're
getting into but just be aware that once
it's built and it weighs 70 or 80 pounds
you're probably going to want to move
the thing into other rooms for testing
yourself rather than have employees do
it because you don't want injury claims
so keep that in mind if you're in the
business of reviews but this thing I
mean just this is generally how you move
it once it has a system inside of it
you're going to lean it back and pivot
it and this is where some of the design
elements that coolermaster is invested
in here actually pay off so I've seen
two sides of what people think of these
rails some think they look stupid and
look like sled components or skis and
something they're awesome
regardless of what you think from a
aesthetic standpoint from a practicality
and function standpoint they're actually
really good they're bolted into the
chassis so you're not going to break off
you can lift the thing and carry it like
this if you wanted to and they also
serve as a means to lift it where you're
not gonna rip components off like that
because if you did that you lift it from
the back it's gonna suck if this thing
comes off and you don't realize it's
gonna come off and you drop the whole
computer so as you'll see soon this is
part of Coolermaster is kind of present
design tropes where they've got these
thinner cheaper plastic panels that
attach in places like the front or the
back or the top in some instances that
come off very easily
again aha but provides some kind of
visual I don't know a coup trend and so
some kind of visual extra that helps
round out the case in this instance but
also you don't pick it up there because
you will lose a foot when you drop it
all that regard
aside though the case actually obviously
is pretty easy to build in for the most
part it's a large case so it's kind of
hard to screw that up easy to put things
where they belong
gets a little more difficult when you
want to invert it or rotate it for stack
effect cooling which is something we
haven't really seen since the Raven zero
two did it with Silverstone a long time
ago but those rotation and inversion
jobs do take some time the first time
you do it plan to spend about 45 minutes
figuring it out removing all the panel's
putting them back end things like that
once you've got it done it's not as bad
but just just be aware that the extra
build time required is there again
though you probably only do that once so
it's not the biggest thing to complain
about in the world and there aren't a
lot of major things to complain about on
the case we actually liked it overall we
tend to like these bigger cases it's got
some really good features up here and
thus panel for one very easy to remove
and easy to clean but also underneath
here is a mounting cage for radiators
and fans so if you wanted to it's only
two screws to access it you pull both
out you pull the cage out and then you
can mount your rat or your fans and
reinstall it all in one piece so that's
actually really nice as you'll find
because the case is so big that if
you're working on it on a table like
this it kind of sucks to keep doing this
and trying to screw stuff in so they've
thought that through and you can remove
pieces to build it kind of all modularly
on the table and then reassemble it in
fact they've done it to an extent that
you can pull the motherboard tray out
build on the tray reinsert the tray with
the motherboard on it and keep building
that doesn't apply if you have big Tower
coolers but you get the idea so kind of
cool in a lot of ways kind of silly in a
lot of ways but that's what you get with
what is effectively a super Tower
let me just exaggerate how tall this is
hang on okay you know what good enough
you can't see the back of it because
it's so tall so you don't know that it's
not lined up properly yeah I don't know
let's let's go through some of Patrick's
build notes and then we'll go through
the thermals and noise so for Patrick's
notes he says although the see 700 Pete
does have a large glass side panel the
default layout obscure isn't much of the
interior making the external LEDs the
focus the power supply shroud and a
large plate of metal hiding the hard
drive and
drive bays can be removed to make
internal components fully visible but
the case won't fully benefit from flashy
LED fans if you were to buy them even
the top panel has a double layer of mesh
that would obscure such things the fans
Coolermaster ships with the case are
plain and functional much like the focus
of this case it's going after
functionality over anything else the
panel includes some basic controls for
case lighting which can optionally be
synced with the motherboard and fan
speed as well
there are labeled LEDs to indicate the
current settings and you can toggle them
by pushing the physical buttons on the
outside of the case fan speed can either
be high or low which means 12 volts or 7
volts and IO consists of a single USB
3.1 type C port sandwiched between four
USB 3.0 or 3.1 gen one if you prefer
airports and standard 3.5 millimeter
headphone and mic jacks beneath we
expect to see some more high-end cases
following suit and not bothering with
2.0 as time goes on but this is still
among the first to do it one of these
strong points of the massive fold towers
we reviewed recently like the dark Bass
Pro 900 the view 71 TG for example is
that they dwarf the ATX board we use for
testing and leave plenty of room for
coolers and cable management the power
supply is held above the floor of the
case and has ample clearance on all
sides even with the shroud installed
there's plenty of room for cables
there's a steel plate that screws on
under the side panel to keep things
secure without relying on the side panel
to match everything down and generally
cabling has been decently thought out in
this case the size goes hand-in-hand
with one of the weak points though which
is that they're practically impossible
to maneuver these cases the seesaw 100p
wasn't quite as heavy as we initially
thought as we noted earlier it's still
50 pounds though and you can't exactly
casually flip it around during the build
process so we left the case completely
stationary and installed the motherboard
and GPU without laying it on its side
which is quite a feat especially with be
particularly difficult to access PCIe
screws the metal handles on the Kosmos
cases are typically more aesthetic than
functional but in this instance they
were useful for hauling the case between
rooms each is made of solid aluminum and
held in place with four screws the front
panel has her
any room for ventilation at all
something we were worried about as soon
as we saw the case but we'll test that
in moment there's a thin plastic panel
covering a mesh filter underneath which
is backed by an even finer mesh the top
and bottom filters are constructed in
the same sturdy but potentially
restrictive manner and there are three
140 millimeter fans included with the
case listed as 1200 rpm shipped in the
lower two front slots and the rear
exhaust slot for additional testing this
time we chose to remove the front panel
and then the front panel and filter and
finally to test the case normally but
with the fans shifted up one slot to
direct more air over the power supply
shroud rather than into it for once
removing the front panel is actually a
viable option for users the only
indication that something has been
removed is the two small slots to slot
the fan into users with the optical
drives may wish to remove this panel
regardless of cooling performance to
avoid swinging it outwards every time a
disk tray opens starting with thermal
specific to the C 700 P case where we
reconfigured the enclosure a few
different ways we see stock
configuration CPU load temperature and
torture tests at fifty four point one
degrees Celsius over ambient with idle
at four point four degrees Celsius over
ambient this is what the CPU mainly
cooled by the exhaust fan and tower
cooler the two intake fans are installed
in the bottom of the case by default and
neither is on the vertical level of our
CPU cooler so one pushes from the bottom
front into the PSU shroud and the other
pushes from the middle front into the
middle of the case surprisingly moving
the front fan up didn't have a
significant impact on the CPU
temperature we expected more air to be
moved above the GPU this way but it
seems like cooler master did their
research and chose the stock family out
well at least for our configuration the
front panel restricts enough air at the
top that it just really didn't impact
much as much as the air is coming from
the center of the front panel anyway
relocating the bottom fan to the top
intake position produced effectively
identical thermal results of stock and
removing the front panel did reduce
temperature by about two degrees Celsius
and then removing the filter lowered it
further by three point three degrees
Celsius additionally this drops down to
forty eight point eight Celsius delta T
over ambient and it seems like the
double thick mesh
filter blocks at least as much air as
the solid plastic panel so if you wanted
to improve cooling by a few degrees for
an intensive render project it'd be easy
to just remove the front panel and leave
the filter in place here's a chart with
the comparative numbers for the CE 700p
and other cases we've seen stock
temperature Delta's around 54 degrees
Celsius in both the Vue 71 with an extra
fan and the stock match fic Lele it's
not exceptional but it's a very
reasonable range cooler masters at fifty
two point one degrees Celsius delta T
over ambient without the front panel is
it competitive with the Corsair 270 R
and pushes the C's 700 P into the range
of cases we consider well cooled the
case ends up between the metruff I see
and view 71 ultimately and always starts
getting seriously outmatched once we
venture into more cooling oriented
configurations like VR l06 looking at
cosmos only GPU thermals for a torture
workload GPU delta T was fifty point
four degrees Celsius with two intake
fans pushing air along the bottom of the
case the lowest fan is mostly
encompassed by the power supply shroud
in stock configuration but cooler
masters shroud isn't fully sealed and
the additional airflow still benefits
components outside of it
moving the front fan up didn't do the
GPU any favors and the DT was raised by
about two degrees Celsius with the
decrease in air towards it removing the
front panel was much more helpful though
lowering delta T over ambiens by two
point seven degrees celsius and a
further four point four celsius with the
filter removed as well
comparatively fifty point four degrees
celsius was already and impressively low
temperature for our tests near the
performance of the Rozsival : n but
taking the front panel off lowered the
temperature below anything on our chart
except for the RL zero six again
removing the filter isn't really a
realistic scenario because well
obviously your front of the case is
exposed but it does show how much room
there is for improvement there were only
one layer of mash this could easily have
beat in Silverstone's case coolermaster
see 700 p stock fan configuration
permits the case to perform
exceptionally well with GPU thermals
considering the closed off low noise
front panel the case marginally
outperforms its fellow behemoths that be
quiet dark bass pro 900 and then we'll
take 4u 71
moving onto 3dmark testing for some
realistic scenarios the stock see 700 P
kept the GPU Delta down to 55 degrees
Celsius during a fire strike extreme
stress test just a bit higher than
thermal take score P 3 removing the
front panel would undoubtedly lower this
further but the stock GPU cooling
performance already looks pretty good
compared to other cases on our charts
rendering a blender test file on the CPU
CPU DT reached thirty eight point three
degrees Celsius on par with the
functional but forgettable silverstone
KL zero seven GPU cooling performance is
also good to middling with a dt of
twenty seven point two degrees celsius
when rendering on the GPU this backs up
the torture test conclusions that the
c-- 700 p has good but not incredible
stock cooling and that this extends to
real-world scenarios with the fans at
full speed and in stock configuration
the c 700 p is on the noisy end of the
scale at thirty eight point two DBA with
the s3 forty elite and metruff IC nearby
this case does have an external fan
control though so there's a convenient
way to instantly drop that noise level
when the system is idling the front
panel of the C 700 P contains a sheet of
acoustic foam which apparently does a
pretty good job since removing it but
leaving the mesh filter in place raises
the noise level audibly to forty two
point one DBA the optimal balance of
cooling and noise depends on user
preference but leaving the front panel
off and the fan set to low until
necessary would be a good compromise
overall it's a decent case it's just
three hundred dollars is a lot of money
and at three hundred dollars you really
need to be perfect for the user looking
for a case to be worth purchasing we
can't make that decision fully for you
we can present as much of it as possible
but ultimately you have to look at the
thin and that's up to you so in this
range we recommend looking at the be
quiet dark bass pro 900 it's a little
bit cheaper and is pretty much the same
size it might be worth looking at the
view 71 and it's a lot cheaper than this
but it's a slightly different market as
well
there are plenty of options from
companies like Lian Li and in win in
this price category that tends to be
where they reside for the most part so
really just pull up their entire catalog
cuz half of its going to be in this
price range but what it comes down to
is why why do you want it do you want it
for a sort of home-based server solution
because if that's the case it's workable
it's just there are a lot of features
you might not want and that's true for a
lot of these cases that are this size in
this price inverting the case is
something you do want if you really want
an inverted case it might be worth
looking back in time at the Silverstone
Ravan zero two or maybe the Corsair 600
C which is much cheaper but it's
inverted and that's the only layout you
get so it's going to be cheaper because
it doesn't require the tooling this has
to offer three different orientations
for the board and we did build with it
inverted at the PAX West build event we
did it's fine it's just it takes some
time to do it so so expect that as well
the $300 cost just to kind of put this
out there isn't and on fair price it's
just a high price you look at the
tooling that goes into this thing
tooling on cases like this can cost
easily upwards of six hundred thousand
dollars depending on which company
you're talking to and I don't know what
the tooling to this costs but I know
what tooling cost for a lot of other
cases on the market and it's not
unreasonable to be in the 1/2 million to
million dollar range depending on what
the case is to pay on how much they can
pull from the previous version of the
case and reuse things like that so it
makes sense it's an expensive case
they've got tempered glass on here
that's curved which has questionable
yield we're not sure how many of these
they're able to actually ultimately put
on the case but it's not 10 out of 10 I
can tell you that much so that's why the
price is high but yeah I mean it's it's
really not a bad case it's just
expensive so that's kind of up to you at
this point there are plenty of
alternatives at lower prices though if
this is too much for you so that's all
for this one as always you can go to
patreon.com/scishow help us out directly
you can go to store it I Kara's access
net to pick up a shirt like this one
subscribe for more hopefully the
lighting and the audio will be better
the next one if you don't like them this
one because we won't have
than here to soak up half of my audio
and one-third of my lights I'll see you
