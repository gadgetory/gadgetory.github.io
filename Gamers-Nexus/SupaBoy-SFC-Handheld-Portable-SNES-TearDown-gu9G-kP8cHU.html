different this is a device that I saw
when we were in Japan and I really
wanted to buy it when we were there but
I held off and bought it well just
recently so this is a high Perkin
Superboy SFC and it's a portable
handheld console for SNES cartridges
it's a bit of a legal side skirt because
since you're using the original
cartridge they're not selling it with
any games pre included no roms anything
like that I think it gets past
Nintendo's legal department but we're
gonna take it apart today see what's
underneath and also remove the dust that
came pre-installed under the LCD so
that's part of what we're doing and then
we might look at this later from a
benchmark if we can figure out how to do
it I don't know but let's take it apart
and see see what's really in here to
play these old Super Nintendo games
before that this video is brought to you
by us and the gamers access store you
can go to store documents access net to
pick up one of our ceramic mugs
critically-acclaimed mod mats or
educational video card tear down and PCB
anatomy posters that teach the names and
placements of all the key PCB components
learn more at store des cameras XS net
or click the link below so this is it
this is the hyper consumer boy SFC as
you can see it's got primal rage
socketed right now and that's just an
SNES cartridge the cartridge up there we
actually have four other reasons for
this we have the original SNES here next
to me
and if you look down let's look down
into the pin out down there it's
obviously the same thing because the
cartridge does fit pins are different
color but that doesn't matter
so this handheld version is taking what
was originally in here and just making
it a bit more portable though it's
pretty large portable and this is a
somewhat legitimate way to play your
SNES games without going the emulator
route now it does also here's the dust
particles I was talking about there's
also include those annoyingly so we're
gonna try and get in there and maybe
remove those I don't know but this is
something I've wanted since we went to
Japan so bought it finally and we're
just gonna take it apart and see what it
looks like underneath I guess
walk through the outside you can plug in
the original controllers right here
so there's your controller input stand
it up like that if you want a terrible
viewing angle experience to play it
without actually being handheld and just
for perspective
speaking of viewing angles if you're at
the angle of about the camera right now
we would need this to be almost dead on
for you to see any gameplay otherwise
any other angle it's it's pretty much
blacked out for the rest you've got your
X a Y B you have start select d-pad over
here and then the controller inputs and
for the bottom this toggles bright or
increases brightness one tick at a time
I think it has about four ticks in it
you can also push in to hold it to
switch between 4x3 or 16x9 sixteen by
nine doesn't want one scale or anything
it stretches but if you wanted to fill
the whole screen you could do that and
then it's also got a volume dial
headphone jack and there's AV out in the
top on off with the the battery for this
it's lithium ion so it is rechargeable
and and then I think they advertise nine
hours I haven't validated that but they
advertise nine hours of gameplay on one
charge reset switch pal or NTSC mode if
you want to ruin your experience you get
a pal or if you just have the European
versions of the game releases then you
could do that and then power and DC and
I think that's all the buttons other
than the L&amp;amp;R so let's take it apart
bottom side this is probably a battery
cage I would assume but let's see so
there's our battery try and keep this
all in order so I know how it goes back
together and this we we want to
disconnect this as soon as we can to
reduce chance of damaging anything else
because if it's getting any standby
power which it probably is while we're
messing around with the rest and poking
out things with screwdrivers then it
could short something so let's try and
figure out how to safely disconnect this
early in the process
okay call as a foam pad I would say for
vibration damping but there should be no
vibration at all and then there's just a
two pin power cable here and that just
plugs in internally right in there
so pretty straightforward you know what
I didn't mention the price on this and I
should do that before we take it apart
more I think it was about ninety bucks
which honestly isn't that bad we're
gonna potentially review this more in
the future if there's enough interest in
it let us know if you want to see a full
review or benchmark or anything we'll
try and figure it out but only if
there's interest in that but anyway
about ninety bucks so there's a battery
battery spec is from dong-gwon I've been
there it is 3.7 volts 4400 milliamp
hours and that's all that's all that's
listed for specs so battery if you want
the build service I'm working on you can
get it on stored I cameras Nexus dotnet
currently backordered because you all
keep buying it which we appreciate is it
that simple starting to get separation
make sure firmly in the off position how
do I separate the top ah more screws two
more screws up here that I didn't see oh
okay
instantly separates so it's probably
some cables plugged in yes
okay buttons are coming out there is
right and left like those in a moment
that cable soldered okay alright so when
you first take it apart if you ever do
you would be greeted with these wires
that are soldered straight to the PCB
it's got to be really careful with those
those rip out if we're not careful got a
disconnected up here on this ribbon
cable so let's let's disconnect the
power wire first that's gonna be the
black and the red all the power should
be drained at this point but we're just
gonna take care of anything related to
power to minimize risk of damaging
devices also it's the shortest and the
most fragile cable so okay and then this
one trick with these is to lift that
latch so you just lift up the latch and
there goes alright so what we have
that's that's the one that's the most
fragile so be careful that you see this
cable got like I don't know if that's
intentional or not it's just smashed so
that black that ground right there it's
just completely smashed on top of this
support this sort of Plus shaped support
I'm thinking this is maybe supposed to
be down there but I mean it's oh that
does not look good at all actually look
at how a little thickness there is left
to that it's like smashed down to just
the copper wire inside of it this is
maybe a bit of a quality control
concerned they should probably push this
down along with the red which is either
5 volt or 12 volt probably let's see
can't tell what it is so that's pretty
smashed not too happy about that I don't
know when I rebuild that I'm gonna shove
it down there and just make sure it
stays down there so there's our buttons
from the top they're situated just
against a basic switch right here it
looks similar to kind of those Omron
switches that are prevalent all over the
world a dip switch here led wired
indirectly I will say it's probably
pretty cool to work on a project like
this as the engineers
so for the modules on here SMDs
they are labeled TC t 925 TC t 978 TC t
976 they have some some probe hookups
right here if you wanted to connect the
multimeter
so battery ground so forth
I'm guessing the most common point of
failure and this is going to be these
cables these ones that are soldered in
there if it gets knocked around enough
those old most probably break what's
holding us in this appears to be holding
us in a bit it's plugged into a small
there's a daughter board in there under
the motherboard so I'm trying to be
careful to not break that and that is
for the oh it's for the cartridge okay
how are we connected connected to this
white cable which looks like it feeds
the controllers is this easily
disconnected oh and not just that
actually it's not
not just the controllers that we're
talking about it's the data feed for the
cartridge - yeah so just daughter board
for the cartridge and court reader and I
think that's really all there is to that
side of this there on version 3 though
apparently their PCB let's take a look
at the screen side and I'll just see if
I can remove the dust from there there's
the rotary dial for the volume this is
all passively cooled it's really not
much in here that creates any heat so
there's no there's not even a heatsink
on anything but probably the hottest
thing in here is going to be the screen
and that's that's sinking just into the
PCB which is all copper and fiberglass
anyway so that's kind of a natural
heatsink another thing to be careful of
here is these two wires are also
soldered directly to the PCB and they're
hooked up to a circuit board
that's hooked up to the left and right
buttons that's what we're looking out
there I think yes and that looks like
that's a carbon contact button so you
can see this right here so we have
button depresses and you get contact
from the pad to the pad on the circuit
board and then your signal travels into
the PCB underneath so we just need to be
careful about this this goes over here
about removing this to not rip those out
so what's holding they just pop it up
maybe yes okay cool as well speakers our
speaker wires are soldered in to the
board directly okay so that's out so now
we're just connected to a ribbon cable
what you're not gonna be able to see too
well but that that one right there this
is what's stopping us at this point eggs
there we go okay it is hinged it's
trying to wonder if it was just pressure
fit but nope it was hinged okay how did
all of this go in so here's our screen
hooked up with the ribbon cable all
right cool that was just kind of notched
into place and there's her piece of dust
so now I can fix it how that was on the
inside of the device okay cool so I'll
fix that it's gonna get more dust on it
while I'm working on it so I'll fix that
at the end once when i reassemble off
camera but there's your display it's
pretty good display honestly like in
terms of just quality for what your your
plane like the benefit of this is it's a
small device and it's playing ancient
games that were low resolution so it
works out pretty well for that but we
will I'll I'll remove the dust at the
end after we're done with this so that's
the bottom part and
what I took apart was I took the
speakers out of the sockets all the
buttons fell out when I flipped it what
we wanted and then we're left with this
piece here where you see the speaker's
right there so it's got a rubber stopper
on it or a foam stopper rather and a
little driver in there there's the
speaker driver and those are soldered
directly to the PCB so I have to be a
little careful with those this whole
process it's a bit more fragile than
most things we take apart like a video
card for example just because there's so
much just small wires soldered to things
and they did not expecting you to take
it apart in services so not built to the
standards we would typically be used to
but now there's your contacts I think
these are carbon contacts I'm not sure
let's take these off actually we can
look yes
so you've got the contacts plate down
there under it and they've got some
super glue or hot glue here used at the
corners I'm not sure or is that just
flux it's bit of glue they're holding
stuff in you can see some glue down here
to some flux so not the cleanest solder
job I've ever seen but a bunch of
resistors bunch of capacitors labeled R
and C there's
shunt resistors even if it were like
nvidia gpus you can short them to
increase the power limit and then we've
got a controller that reads AMT six-30 a
I'd have to look that up as well
confidential data sheet for it that's
the top result on Google and it says
it's a video display controller so AMT
six-30 a that thing right there that's
the video display controller which makes
sense this is the PCB closest to the
display and the datasheet came out 2015
to give you an idea for the age of the
product let's see if it tells us
anything I'll just read the general
description here so general description
in the datasheet says AMT six-30 a is a
highly integrated video control
see or system-on-chip with digital LCD
TFT panel displaying controller and
could support parallel RGB panels srgb
pianos ITU 656 panels digital t-con and
cpu panels ante 630 a integrates a video
decoder and digital TFT LCD panel
control that accepts analog NTSC PL and
SC KMC BBS signals from TV tuners DVDs
or VCR sources Wow
including weak and distorted signals
automatic gain control and nine bit one
channel ad converters analog digital
provide high-resolution video
quantization with automatic video source
and mode detection the marketing point
is that it's highly efficient low cost
and a small area PCB solution and then
if you're curious video could decoder
supports composite video signal C VBS
input multiple standard supported for
ntsc ntsc-j pan so yes so forth three
analog inputs and one crystal required
for all standards twenty-seven megahertz
internal PLL to generate a video clock
and then internal buffers for video
stability and there's also noise
reduction if you need it so pretty neat
smell chip there for the other stuff
most of its going to be on the other PCB
this one let's look these up so this
user says from what I can tell it looks
like a hybrid of the original 1990 tip
set design as well as the later SNSD APU
on board which uses a single chip for
the SPC 700 based audio hardware on
modern chipsets the CPU is TCT data 978
the 2's pvu chips are combined into the
tzt 976 the 975 is a single chip spc 7
honored clone and that is from ace on
this forum see if I can find some more
though on this by looking up the other
number on the chip so these are if you
want to buy just one of them they're a
dollar 85 which is pretty expensive
that's for one and if you buy 2,000 of
them they come down a bit in price
$2,700 for 2020 106 actually but what is
it some memory so lion tech incorporated
it is one megabit 128k times eight
it is SRAM which is static memory and is
that's also pretty expensive memory
typically find it on like a CPU for
cache non-volatile according to this and
two point seven to five point five volts
so that is actually memory are there
multiple of those let's see there are
different models so that one right there
is one mega bit of memory non-volatile
storage this one is so these right here
there are three of those it says the
lion tech ly six two two five six RL is
a is a low power CMOS static
random-access memory SRAM organized as
32768 words by eight bits is fabricated
using high performance high reliability
CMOS technology standby current is
stable within the range of operating
temperature and it is well designed for
low power applications and particularly
well-suited for battery backup
non-volatile memory applications and
this is a see who's this from this is
from foreign Elcom if they are any ll
com they are a seller of this chip so
that's those are the parts now as for
the the CPU and the other controllers my
understanding presently is that one of
these is going to be the CPU another one
has integrated audio control and then
the video processing is over on this PCB
over here right there or at least the
video decoder is over there so that's
pretty much it for the Superboy SFC the
only thing left is the small PCB
connecting the controller inputs we
don't need to take that out and
there's nothing under this it's just
where the cart reader goes when it's all
socketed so now I can take the dust out
of my screen I guess that's what we did
all this for so that's it that's the
Superboy SFC pretty cool small device
and just from a gameplay standpoint it
does work at least ours does I read a
bit of mixed reviews on it on Amazon
just on the review page so your mileage
may vary I think it depends partly on
what region your cartridges are from
because you can toggle between different
regions and I don't know how well it
works for other regions but at least for
the North America region they seem to
work fine so far so yeah that's it if
you want to check it out or buy one I'll
link it down in the description below we
may come back and review this more
properly if you are interested in that
please let us know so we can gauge the
interest because it's a bit different
but I think we can do some cool stuff
with it like maybe try and benchmark it
so that's it for this one you get a
store dockyards nexus net to pick up
shirt like this one or one of our mod
mats or page on our coms house cameras
next subscribe for more I'll see you all
