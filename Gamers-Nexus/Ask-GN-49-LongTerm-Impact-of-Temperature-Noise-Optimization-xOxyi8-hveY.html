of ask GN it's been a little while with
all the video cards and CPUs and things
the format of this series if you haven't
seen it before is leave a question below
or if you're one of our patreon discord
members you can leave a question there
in the ask GN channel we'll address it
if if we get to it in the next video
another thing to point out here there's
a different set layout than normally
we're just kind of playing around with
things trying to get the brains going on
different options and although this is
probably not a permanent set layout this
is actually a functional like area where
we work so it's part of the actual
everyday process but this has given me a
few ideas so close up of the future
starting out we have some questions
about overclocking questions about heat
on vrm components things like that some
questions that were about a iOS and C
LCS will get through all that before
getting to those that this coverage is
brought to you by EVGA and they're 1080p
is c2 which we've recommended fairly
highly for its build quality and the icx
sensors which are kind of fun to play
with you can check our full sc2 review
for the 1080i if you're curious to learn
more or you can click the link in the
description below to find the product
page for the 1080i sc2 getting into the
content before the first question i've
got a box from NZXT is continuing our
NZXT story line they just sent another
box of things so we've got the crack in
G 12 probably reviewing these pretty
soon I have to get around to these but
we've got a lot of actually I have like
three or four other of the liquid cooler
video card mods behind me that I can do
too so we've got these that came in we
have a white and a black model which I
believe are the only two that they're
shipping but the white one is pretty
good for some flare if you've got a
white and black case so that might be
kind of fun to play around with well get
those eventually more importantly than
GXE anyway is that they have sent
another puck so this is an hour now
probably our fourth or fifth puck that
they've sent us
if you don't alleviating of a storyline
well I guess flash in a quick
playback of the s340 elite review where
i said that the puck was a literally a
piece of rubber Magnus's they're very
happy about it and it does it my name is
Mitch but slightly runagate now
and ever since saying that they've sent
us lots of pucks so I guess we've got
another one I don't know if this one's a
different color or not most the others
are black and white you know what I've
been saying is we should probably just
give some of these away on patreon or
something like that there's a blue one
actually looks pretty good now I'm going
to hold my ground and not use it because
I said I wouldn't in the review but the
blue looks good all right so enough NZXT
we've we've encouraged their bad
behavior enough a first question is from
discord I don't have your name written
down but the the question from discord
says something I've been curious to get
your opinion on if low-noise operation
in a gaming rig is a primary goal would
you generally recommend an AI be air
cooler like the FTW three for example
which we just reviewed or an AO hybrid
solution should not like any of your GN
hybrid builds I don't have a ton of
experience with a iOS and I'm concerned
about idle noise being a nuisance when
working but I've also heard that I don't
always on modern a iOS is negligible and
there are only benefits to put in na IO
on the GPU during gaming what would you
suggest so there's a good question we
talked about this a bit with a Titan XP
hybrid mod where one of the tests I ran
had the radiator fan at 40% in the VR
I'm fat 22% and temperatures were great
they're better than the stock card but
if you run it at 100% out of the box
which is what it's going to do then it's
definitely pretty loud the a IO is like
the one on this mod we have here which
is a what is this 1080i I think might be
a 1080 but this one we've got the EVGA
radiator on it these are kits you can
buy for a hundred bucks they come with a
shroud which we obviously didn't use
this band does run a bit loud when it's
out of honor percent which is going to
be basically all the time so the
solution is when you buy one of these
kits you
you replace the fan or you run an
extension cable to the fan and you plug
it into the motherboard instead and then
you can control your fan speeds of it
better so what we've done is set it to
like 40 percent the temperatures are
still around 50 C they're lower than an
air cooler and they're quieter they're
less than 40 DBA I think in our testing
for the Titan XP but you can view those
results for more on that
so the idle noise though that is going
to be limited again I mean your noise is
basically the same no matter what
because unless you get like a PWM fan
and build a curve for it you're running
out of fixed percentage so your Idol is
going to be the same as your load noise
so if you have 39 DBA then that's
definitely going to be louder than
something like an FC 2 or an F CW 3 or
any non EVGA card like Twin Frozr cards
when they spin down to zero rpm under
no-load you're going to be louder than
those cards so if your noise floor is
like 26 DBA and you have a bunch of
passive or nearly passive components
then the only thing making noise is
going to be the radiator fan and so yes
that would be louder the pump noise
itself I don't notice it I know people
who say they do you could definitely
notice it if you mount this incorrectly
or if you're just unlucky maybe like if
you take one of these and mount it at
the bottom of your case you got the
video cards like that and this is down
there that is an advisable because now I
you get well actually I'll talk about
this more in one of the questions in
here but now your barbs are going to be
kind of near an air pocket potentially
so that would suck air through and
create noise but to answer your question
of noise levels it comes down to tuning
the fan curve what I like to do
personally is like with our render
machine I would take something like this
like a hybrid mod the I why approach
manually well swap the fan with
something better plug it into the
motherboard and then build a curve in
the motherboard if that permits you to
and then at that point you can hopefully
run nearly idle with nearly zero rpm
idle and you would have way lower load
load noise levels
lower temperatures maybe slightly louder
idle noise level is not a bad trade
overall so that's kind of my thoughts on
it next question I believe also from
discord serpent xsf says sgn question on
the gigabyte or scarred Extreme Edition
or not what was you though this is
referring to our review what was he used
to overclock it afterburner or as
graphics engine any others what if any
would you recommend using to overclock
also I agree no point in buying a car
that a 750 plus as all of the cards
1080i are borderline on thermal power
limit anyway so the first part of this
is what do we use to overclock the auras
card I think we probably use afterburner
but may have been precision depends on
whichever was the newest at a time
they're really all the same for the most
part I use I you have to use precision
for these EVGA cards with icx stuff
otherwise you're not going to get
anything out of the thermistors because
afterburner and none of the others they
don't recognize them they don't know
that they exist so you have to use
precision for the icx cards really other
than that it doesn't matter a whole lot
it's just kind of which interface you
feel like is the best or which one's the
most up-to-date afterburner is good you
need to make sure you go into the
settings and toggle a few of the things
before really getting into it like the
voltage control and limitations which
you're facing on you with Pascal
I do like afterburner because it's I
guess I'm just familiar with it that's
really all comes down to it would like
with any other tool precision I use for
icx cards after we're never pretty much
everything else it doesn't matter a
whole lot because at the end of the day
you're tuning the same options really no
matter what it's just you know where are
they in the UI next the next part of
this what would you recommend
I mean after in a precision whatever you
feel like I guess next question was from
oh it's actually the same question from
a YouTube commenter whose death grip fan
said when you and the crew at Jian
overclock your PC is what programs do
you use check stability of your OC and
when do you consider it to be a stable
OC so I've got you the the tools for
GPUs for CP as I use BIOS on a UEFI
exclusively I don't use Raisa master or
any other NOS altar because I don't
trust it bios only for me in terms of
testing the stability there are a few
options so for memory you can there are
some crunching crunching tools we use
when doing the memory training for Rison
and like pi tools which calculate pi or
find values those are good for memory
overclocking because they like super Pi
I think is one of them we may have used
those are good because they find
instability very fast and if that's all
you're searching for is AI is it
unstable and if so I need to reboot and
change the settings then that's a good
tool for CPUs and GPUs GPUs I will burn
in on a few different tools so I
actually find that games are a little
bit better at finding instability on
GPUs and synthetics so 3dmark will not
always find instability whereas The
Witcher 3 does every single time so my
overclock with a GPU might look fine in
3d mark but then we run the Witcher 3 or
something like that or Ghost Recon
wildlands and it crashes in like a
minute and that's just because of how
the clock is enumerated so fur mark is
another great example with fur mark you
can really make it look like your offset
is stable and that's because one fur
mark is seriously stressing the power
component so your clock doesn't boost as
high so the offset doesn't push it as
far and to if you look at the clock it
is a fixed clock rate infirm arc
non-stop so if you're at like 2012 its
2012 megahertz the whole way through
with no real dips whereas in game you
get spike units and that spike enos is
when you can encounter instability so
fur mark is not a great tool for
stability testing with overclocking in
my experience I would use a mix of three
work stress tests during an initial
setup and then games on loop to finalize
things CPUs in the past I've used
prime95 quite a bit I'm starting to move
away from it a little bit at this point
but prime is still good Linpack access
or linux is good not Linux but Linux
some tools like that basically anything
that generates a lot of heat
now they do stress them
so like some will do AVX testing whereas
others might not that's the difference
depend on what you're testing for your
overclock but hopefully that gives you a
couple tools to look into next question
is Fitz WM this looks like at this cord
one whereas death-grip fan was a youtube
question Fitz WM says that not sure this
asked the end material but hey I got a
great deal on 1080i a 1080 hybrid kit
from a friend I was thinking about
modding the shroud for my Ti I know I
don't need it but hey new things I don't
have a dremel though and I've never used
one before how hard is it is there a kit
you'd recommend for a noob I've used
Dremel for case mods a lot in the past I
used to do a lot of case mods before we
really did YouTube videos I have used
them on bikes a lot I've used them on
computer parts a lot the Dremel is a
great tool to have around I'm not going
to really I'm not going to recommend
specific kits but generally just from
glancing through Amazon a lot of the 100
to 120 dollar kits look like good
starters the one I have I think was
about 200 bucks and it's had absolutely
no problems at all I think it's actually
just a dremel like brand dremel kit this
is just replaceable bits you swap the
bit to something that will cut the
material you're cutting better than
whatever's on there and you should be
good to go it's great to use tiny small
rotating saw more or less and if you're
trying to cut through something like
this that's probably exactly the right
tool to do because you could if you have
the original like top part of the shroud
you'd basically cut a hole right here
where these the tubes are cut a hole out
and route it through there it shouldn't
be a big deal next question is uh we've
got two options here let's go with this
one first
so roarson said on discord with the
drastically reduced temperature is using
the hybrid mod does that have any
long-term implications as to how long
the cards last I would assume being able
to remove a large amount of heat might
mean that the solder joints on the cards
are less stressed
I see broken solder joints all the time
especially on electronics from around
2006 or so when the switch to lead-free
solder was me
while it's less of a concern these days
I still think thermal transients wreak
havoc on solder joints from what I've
seen so I would think keeping the GPU
much cooler would help long term life of
the card I understand this is a complex
question it can't be practically
answered yes that's we've talked about
this before
thermal impact on product life is really
hard to measure there are formulas you
can use the companies that do is kind of
testing like actual stress testing an
ASA tech for example does it on their
coolers they accelerate it and we did
this at Dell when I was there too you
basically you have chambers different
ways to do it so where I worked there
was a shock and vibe you have shock and
vibration tables that just hammer the
crap out of the product to try and see
if it'll break from different amounts of
known force there were drop testing rigs
you see if they break from different
drop Heights things like that and then
there were also a thermal chambers and
so the Chamber's that I've worked with
in the past or I've seen at most of the
companies we work with today they do hot
and cold testing so they put these
products through various hot and cold
cycles to cycling them faster than you
would in real life because the seasons
change at a very slow pace so I cycle
them for different environments like you
might be testing for ruggedized species
that will go to the Middle East or for
PCs that might go to the Arctic or
something like that what they also do is
they run thermal cycles to stress test
for how heat might impact components
over time where you have expansion and
contraction of things on the card as
it's going through these hot and cold
cycles because if you burn up to let's
say 9 DC on a component or a bunch of
components on the board and then you
cool down rapidly to something like 50 C
or maybe even down to ambient to be turn
it off that's going to at least have
some impact on on how the components on
the board are reacting to the
temperature so the way they normally do
it is hot and cold cycling now that
means that I don't have a good answer
for you because doing this kind of
testing without a large sample size and
a long
time and a lot of equipment is basically
impossible to answer how long will this
survive versus the air-cooled variant I
don't have an answer for you that said I
think both will probably outlive the
usable life of the system which is
ultimately what you're looking at so if
you're building a computer and you tend
to replace even in something like five
years the the reference card or the
liquid-cooled card will outlive that
service life the one place that might
not be true is this radiator you'd pod
replace had about five years but
otherwise I don't I don't think the
extra life you get from running cooler
will necessarily be noticeable maybe if
it's in a super long deployment or you
hope to pull it off a shelf at ten or
fifteen years later it would matter but
I have no reasonable way of predicting
that for you running cooler is generally
better for most components except pains
like flash with an end but how much
better is it hard to say next question
Jessica Gifford said Steve you mentioned
when installing an a i/o cooler
vertically to put the tubes going at the
bottom for quieter pump noise so what
I'm wondering is if you install it going
at the bottom or if you install the AIO
cooler horizontally at the top of the
case with tubes pointing down how does
it that effect the pump compared to
vertically as described so I've spoken
to a few people about this like
suppliers to better understand this over
the years this is more an issue with cl
cs and a iOS then with open-loop coolers
point that out first and the theory is
that the air should sit higher than the
Barb so if you've got the tubes aiming
down the barbs are here so these are our
Barb's they've got flanges in them too
so barb sit there you want the air to be
in a place where it's not just going to
get sucked through because one there's
always going to be air in the loop no
matter what it's not a perfectly closed
system to over time there's permeation
as I just said these tend to get
replaced in about five years so as it
permeates you'll get more air in the loo
and you want the air to be higher than
the barb because if it's mounted down at
the bottom of the case you're you're
fighting you're fighting the the risk of
sucking air into the loop so tubes
aiming up we'll run into significant
problems as stated by the manufacturers
themselves but with the tubes down the
air should be at the top of the tank
basically floating up with a liquid
below it so liquid should not be impeded
by the air that's that's really the idea
now Tan's your question when it's
mounted like this versus like this it
doesn't really matter like this is bad
you don't want the tubes on top
generally speaking if you try it out the
pump noise will probably be lessened
with the tubes like that on the bottom
but if you're looking at vertical
mounting like this or horizontal if
you'd prefer to look at it that way this
it doesn't matter it's because the tubes
are down there's going to be up so
you're fine it's really only when you're
mounted this way that orientation
matters a lot and don't install them at
the bottom so that's all for this one
