recap for the last week in the computer
hardware industry we've got a lot of
good items for today including just a
teaser of some meltdown inspector
coverage we have coming up within the
next couple days we decided to reach out
to some of the initial researchers who
found the meltdown inspector exploits
and asked them a couple of questions
demystify some of the more confusing
elements and debunk some of the myths
that have arisen from the ashes of the
insanity as everyone has panics about
these bugs so that'll be a really good
content piece I'm looking forward to
that it'll be in the same tune as the
RAM and the GP research pieces that's
coming up soon Samsung's got GD r 6 and
news for us Andy has hired a basically a
replacement for Raja Kaduri and a
counterpart along with the replacement
and Andy's also killed off their
primitive shader function and most
reasonable capacity we spoke to Micro
Center a bit and then Microsoft
telemetry news what's new and a
Silverstone cooler so all that more for
this week before that this video is
brought to you by the gamers Nexus at
patreon and our patreon backers you want
to help us out directly you can go to
patreon.com/scishow and team or you can
support us at $5 or higher and get
access to behind-the-scenes videos as we
release them once or twice a month
learn more at the link in the
description below so for a quick preview
of what's going on for the site this
week again that meltdown specter piece
is coming up that's our big research
piece right now we've spoken with a
couple of different research and
security firms that discovered the
initial exploit and basically emailed
them a set of questions to say can you
clarify this for us which in many cases
was can you clarify the specter require
physical access to the computer because
that was something we'd seen printed by
a lot of comments and I genuinely didn't
know so we asked them and they gave us
some answers on that we asked about what
they thought was overlooked with spectra
and meltdown so out of all the media
blitz and all the consumer reports and
things like that
what's something that everyone has
failed to mention and then
on the flip side of that what is
something that's either blown out of
proportion or just straight false so
lots of cool stuff coming up for that
also we have a probably article only
benchmark of the Xbox one X Dragonball
Fighter Z or whatever that came is
called it just showed up Namco Bandai
had us on their media list from years
and years ago when we did more Games
coverage so we're gonna benchmark that
and we'll put that in just an article on
the website if you're curious about the
framerate but let's get into the
hardware news here samsung has g DD r 6
information and Sam Sun revealed
somewhat recently that they entered mass
production with the industry's first GTD
r 6 memory which will of course be used
on future graphics cards likely sooner
than you might think
this is announced in addition to using
GD r 6 for things like AI automotive VR
was an interesting side note in there as
well as a our augmented reality and also
network systems so gamers for the most
part are just going to be looking
forward to GPUs but there's a whole lot
of other stuff in the ecosystem
Samsung's first GDD r 6 ICS will be
available in 16 gigabit densities
offering 18 gigabits per second per pin
transfer rate and up to 72 gigabytes per
second of bandwidth per chip Samsung's
ggd are six speeds are more than double
that of gddr5 eight gigabit per second
and higher than g 5x memory add up to 11
gigabits per second the new memory is
built on Samsung's 10 nanometer class
technology class here referring to
anything between 10 and 19 nanometers
stretching it a bit we can assume that
Samsung isn't that 10 nanometers yet
with GD dr6 otherwise they would
unambiguously acknowledge that
achievement still according to Samsung
10 nanometer class technology brings
about a 30% productivity increase
presumably compared to 20 nanometer
manufacturing and that productivity
increase probably translates some more
chips per wafer
additionally Samsung has noted the
voltages of these chips will be down to
one point three five volts operating for
the voltage from 1.5 v previously
required 4G
dr5 or g5x this means higher or better
efficiency you have less heat to
dissipate and worry about which is
particularly important if you're sharing
cold plates with thins and Samsung
doesn't really elaborate on this they
just point to improved circuit design
and that's about it
they also made no mention of when G GD
r6 will ship globally or commercially
but they've basically touted that they
will have it sometime in 2018 and it's
in production so Samsung is seemingly on
schedule here and we can reasonably
assume that Samsung's clients are
planning products with the solution
already which would include the GPU
makers and the announced it's hiring of
two new senior members for the Radeon
Technology Group were RTG filling in for
the role left behind by Raja Kaduri who
departed for Intel not too long ago the
two new hires are Mike Rayfield SVP and
general manager of AMD RTG and david
wayne SVP of engineering for RTG David
Owens roles that will pertain entirely
to architecture and hardware development
of future and the GPUs while Rayfield
will handle overall direction strategy
and business development mike ray field
has been in the industry since about
1983 his work experience includes 16
years as director of sales at Texas
Instruments two years at Cisco for
business development right around the
dot-com boom seven years at Nvidia is a
mobile division as a general manager and
five years at micron as a general
manager of the mobile units
David Wayne's history the engineer of
the two dates back to the beginning of
consumer graphics including a history as
a design manager SGI which is the
company from which Jensen Owen later
defected to form and Vidya wayna also
worked his way up from engineering
manager at ATI to engineering director
to senior director and stated ATI and
AMD from 2000 to 2012 later leaving for
synaptics in 2012 through present
relating to Andy's RTG groups the user
mark Souder on 3ds Center org posted
some information from an and the
breakout conference a couple weeks ago
that noted that and the
apparently intends to kill its implicit
primitive shader functions which was
supposed to be a major feature of the
Vega architecture primarily RX Vega it
is a mostly gaming targeted function so
to bring everyone up to speed on what
that means
primitive shaders are something we
talked about when we viewed Vega
frontier edition and then later rx Vega
and when everyone is saying wait for
drivers they were basically saying wait
for the primitive shader function the
implicit primitive shader function to be
functional and that's because the
primitive shader function is supposed to
somewhat intelligently discard
primitives which would be things like
geometry triangles stuff like that and
we have a pretty law in interview with
Mike Mantor of AMD talking about what
the plans were for that function those
will probably never come to be at this
point so this was done by combining the
vertex and geometry shader functions and
D at times claimed a 2x increase in
speed for vertex shader code execution
enabled by this function and now what's
happening is the implicit part of the
primitive shader functionality is being
removed it looks like and instead they
will leave an explicit shader path so if
a game developer explicitly supports it
meaning the game developer manually
writes code to leverage the primitive
shader functionality that was discussed
at launch then it will work but there's
no implied functionality it requires
someone to sit down and write the code
for it now this would be okay
except AMD's Vega market share is
basically zero and if there is no market
share to speak of for a an architecture
which presently spans two devices why
would you code for it as a game
developer there's so much more you can
spend your time on so it's unfortunate
part of that is because Vega had a very
high cost to make and still has a high
cost to make and it's hard for them to
make money on it part of it's because
it's in high demand by miners and part
of its just global shortage of supply or
increase in cost from memory and things
like that so they got has not really
saturated the market
in our opinion to get significant
development support for this
functionality from game developers
however it's possible that a company
like IDI for example with doom or
perhaps with Wolfenstein or any of those
other games that have been advancing the
low-level API front maybe one of them
will do something with the explicit
primitive shader discard but for now
it's it's looking like that's not really
gonna be the case next news item Micro
Center we complained a lot about them
and their prices in our I think asked GN
video so got some news on that front
Micro Center did notify us and confirmed
that they are working to inform all of
their sales associates of their own
sales programs so hopefully next time
we're anyone else goes in the store and
asks about the program for building your
own system discounts they should be up
to speed because we knew it existed we
asked about it but I mean it was
obviously a disconnect where not every
employee in the store knows the rules so
that's what happens when you have retail
stores with lots of employees not
everyone's up to speed it sounds like
they're they're doubling down on that
effort to get everyone up to speed and
all the sales associates on the floor if
you encounter a micro center store that
doesn't know what the build your own
computer discount is you can tell them
this per micro centers own website video
cards as part of this effort to get them
into the hands of gamers video cards are
limited to one per household not person
they do not offer price matching
apparently unless they're matching in an
upward direction and they do however
offer the coupon if you can get an
associate who understands that where if
you spend $700 and purchase a processor
and other components that push you to
700 so CPU motherboard Ram for example
gets you there quickly spent 700 bucks
by a CPU and whatever else is required
to get there and then they discount the
GPU back towards MSRP so that's what
micro centers told us hopefully you're
able to to take advantage of that
you still will need to go in there and
ask the representatives when the
shipments come in though because from
what I've been told
Micro Center is basically clearing their
GPU inventory within an hour of getting
it so even with that news you need to go
make friends with someone who works
there and ask them when the shipments
come in because otherwise you're not
gonna get one most likely unless you
camp in front of the store at 9:00 a.m.
when they open so our ever thanks to
Margaret Centre for hopefully correcting
that if they can get everyone on the
same page it sounds like I guess like a
50% decent solution there's not a lot
they can do in all fairness because I
mean demand is high the supplies low and
cost for GP Manufacturing's gone up so
not a lot that can be done anyway
in Microsoft telemetry news a Windows
diagnostic data viewer has been added to
the next Windows 10 release windows
insiders will get early access to this
and Microsoft describes this as part of
their commitment to quote be fully
transparent on the diagnostic data
collected from your Windows devices how
it is used and to provide you with
increased control over that data
remember that earlier Microsoft actually
released a special telemetry free
version of Windows 10 for the China
market and for the US and most the rest
of the world there's still all the
telemetry in there now they're late
letting you see what data they're
collecting on your usage although we're
unclear on whether you can toggle any of
that it doesn't sound like you can maybe
some of it you can because they do say
increase the control over that data but
either way you'll be able to see what
they're spying on you about so that's
cool I guess
common data is primarily being reported
this will include operating systems name
version device ID device class
diagnostic level selection crash logs
any other failure logs event your type
of information additionally device
connectivity and configuration device
properties and capabilities preferences
and settings peripherals device network
information product and service
performance data that show the device
health performance and reliability data
movie Wow
move the Swiss this note
was added by Patrick I didn't know how
this one movie consumption functionality
on the device and device file queries
and important to note that the
functionality is not intended to capture
user viewing or listening habits but I
guess just the aggregate telemetry
pertaining to those things product and
service usage data is also being looked
at including details logged from usage
of the device operating system
applications and services and then
software setup and inventory such as all
installed applications install history
application install history windows
update history device update information
and so forth so the good news is now you
can see all of those things that they're
pulling for allegedly improvement of the
operating system but I mean you can
basically get Windows 10 for free now
and there's a reason for that they're
making their money somewhere
last one here Silverstone's got a new
Argonne series cooler we've actually
historically liked their Argonne coolers
and they've done pretty well in our
testing this one however is a
low-profile cooler it is the Argonne AR
11 and it's it's low to the socket it
supports a 95 watt TDP or greater
depending on case airflow and it's using
a 92 millimeter fan that's only 15
millimeters thick that spins at 1200 to
3000 rpm and maybe 55.8 or so CFM of air
at forty four point five decibels when
it's maxed out dimensions it's about the
full size you can get before exiting the
clearance zone is 97 by 94 by 47
millimeters and it's got four six
millimeter heat pipes with aluminum fins
for the fin stack and then a fan on top
of it price is TBD but if you like small
form-factor pcs it does look like a
promising cooler so that's all for this
one as always you can subscribe for more
