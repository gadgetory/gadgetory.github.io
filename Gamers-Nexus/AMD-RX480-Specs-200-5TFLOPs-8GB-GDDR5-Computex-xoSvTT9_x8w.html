few days ago they gave us a 4am news
announcement that we had to get up and
do in 90 degrees in Taipei at 7am so
this is the Radeon r x 480 I just got
this information we have the specs of
the card the price on the release date
before getting into that all this
coverage is brought to you by msi and
their new x99 a broad well II
motherboards including the gaming pro
carbon first off it is a
two-hundred-dollar card the Radeon r x
480 they are not using the r9 r7
branding and the RX 480 has these
respects 5 teraflops it has 36 compute
units or c use its running 256 gigabyte
per second memory bandwidth has eight
gigabit per second data rate on the die
for the gddr5 memory so g5 memory as it
is shortened is maxes out at about eight
gigabits per second and most cards in
the mid-range to high-end do run that
eight gigabit per second data rate it
has four or eight gigabytes of gddr5 and
we're not sure what the price is on the
eight gigabytes or the four we don't
know if it's if it's different or not
the memory interface is 256 bits there's
a 150 watt TDP for polaris 10
architecture probably polaris 10 anyway
the card is branded as a giant air
quotes VR premium I'm not quite sure if
I really care about that since every
manufacturers branding everything as if
you are ready now it's got free sync
support DP at 1.3 and 1.44 DisplayPort
it supports HD are on 1.4 release date
is jun 29th and released price is two
hundred dollars it is probably on
Polaris 10 and we're unsure if the 8
gigabyte model will be 250 or if they're
all going to be 200 definitely 4
gigabyte will be below two hundred
dollars for the reference card though
and as far as the the high end of
Polaris it looks like there's not going
to be a high end that's kinda what the
rumors have been for a while now Polaris
seems to be pointed strictly at the
mid-range market and budget market and
then we'll see viga or Vega whatever for
the high-end later this year that is
slated for 2016 and it is also slated
for HB m2 which would be the first card
that's
art sit outside of the p100 Tesla
accelerated card which is not a gaming
card as far as competition the 8
gigabyte version of the RX 480 would be
directly competing with the gtx 1070
which is 8 gigabytes of gddr5 we just
reviewed it and how the performance
metrics online that card at the low end
is priced at three hundred eighty
dollars so even if the 8 gigabyte are x
480 is 250 which we don't know if it is
that would still be kind of separate
markets for the two of them they
wouldn't necessarily directly compete in
price there's 130 dollar gap so that's
all we have for this radeon r x 480 we
were not given information on other
cards just yet again release date jun
29th priced $200 5 teraflops and that
pretty much wraps it up for the
reference card the aib models the
partner models i don't know if they're
gonna be cheaper than two hundred
dollars not but we will certainly try
and find out so as always stay tuned for
the rest of computex coverage you can
find the links in the description below
for information on this video card
thanks for watching patreon link apparel
video we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
