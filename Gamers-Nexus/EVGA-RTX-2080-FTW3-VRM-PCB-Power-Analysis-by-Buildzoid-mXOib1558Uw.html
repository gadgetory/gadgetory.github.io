gonna be taking a look at the GTX 20/80
FTW three PCB from EVGA so this is one
of the first custom GTX 20/80 PCBs that
we're gonna get to well actually one of
the first gtx 28 PCBs to look at period
and it's it's very impressive
but that seems to be the case for like
the entire 20 series lineup but even
like the reference cards are getting
kind of ridiculous and I wonder if it's
maybe just because they're expensive and
not so much because they actually need
it because judging by the Titan V these
things still don't scale with voltage so
there's not really any reason to ram a
ton of power into one of these cores
unless you're on liquid nitrogen and
this card right here is already excluded
from liquid nitrogen use by virtue of
this memory power circuit being where it
is before that this video is brought to
you by us and the gamers Nexus store at
store dock gamers Nexus net you can pick
up one of our mod mats now on backorder
because they keep selling out or you can
grab one of our other products like the
Raglan 2-tone hoodie which we have in
stock or the full gamers Nexus logo
t-shirt that we just restocked in cotton
and tri-blend
learn more at store gamers Nexus net
nice PCB it's just I wouldn't like that
I wouldn't like you can't use it on
liquid nitrogen just because that's
where we're like that's right there and
that's gonna get in the way of any a
liquid nitrogen pot you're gonna try to
attach to this and that's kind of a
major problem in my opinion so that's
your vmm VR I'm up there the card also
comes with a bio switch the core is of
course this giant strip right here which
that vrm is so big that they've actually
ended up making the PCB a lot taller
which I think they kinda have a lot of
empty space here so honestly they could
have gone for one of the more like
oddball vrm layouts where you know that
they like line that put like half the
vrm here and then the other half of the
arm here and then they could have
probably crammed the memory of erm up
there somewhere though there are
downsides to doing that because
essentially you have one
half of the vrm doing less work than the
other half just by virtue of being
further away from the GPU Corp as well
as having some extra power loss across
the power plane just because of the
distance so you know it's like this is
better in terms of power delivery it's
just worse in terms of making the card a
baker without you know really maximizing
the usage of the PCB space then again
most of these cards are apparently loose
like very closely based on the reference
PCB which kind of makes sense because
this looks like they just took the
reference PCB and added four more phases
to it and then move the memory circuit
so as well as the switch added and put
it on dual eight pins so you have that
there for power monitoring standard
Nvidia you know you have a Texas
Instruments I on a 3-2 to one down here
and that also means that you can do all
of your typical shunt mods with liquid
metal stacked shunts soldered on top of
shunts long piece of wire soldered on
top of shunts which with the long piece
of wire soldered on top of shunts you
need to actually be kind of careful with
how long that wire is if it's too short
it's gonna trip safety on the card where
it'll think that the there's a
malfunction because the power reading is
too low which is also the reason you
can't just directly short over the
shunts if you don't want to mess around
with modifying the actual shunts there's
a bunch of capacitors around the eye and
a three two to one which are used for
input for filtering the actual voltage
drop across the shunts before it gets
into the read into the sense pins of the
iodine three two to one and if you want
you can apply a resistor across those
capacitors typically around the size of
ten ohms and that'll give you a say
three times increase in power
consumption it really depends on how
that filtering circuit is actually wired
up though but on some of the ten series
cards if I remember correctly a 10 ohm
resistor would give you a three times
increase in maximum power consumption
and like it would allow the card to pull
three times more power not that the card
would actually go and do that because
obviously it's not gonna pull power it
can't use so you know standard in video
right here with
the current monitoring setup and that's
kind of normal and then you have a bunch
of minor VRMs over here so you're gonna
have things like the 1.8 volts VPP rail
for the gddr5 GD d r 6 I'm so used to
saying Gd or 5x4 high-end Nvidia at this
point but GD d R 6 which isn't that
different from gddr5 X actually like in
terms of power requirements it's very
very similar it runs on 1.3 5 volts on
the VM rail or VDD Q if you want the
technical term that the data sheets use
1.8 volts of EPP then there's gonna be I
assume this is gonna be pax actually 1.8
volts might be over here and then
because the thing is this has a USB
type-c connector and that USB type-c
connector needs a 5 volt rail and you
can't get 5 volts off of this because
this is 12 volts and 3.3 only so yeah
that that's just something worth
considering that there's gonna be a 5
volt regulator somewhere on the card and
this might be 1.8 volts or that could be
PEX that's also another option that that
could be the PAX rail which sits at one
volt but all of these are basically
minor rails and you don't need to worry
about them unless they don't work and if
you have a car or one of these cards you
basically like they either put out 0
volts or they put out whatever voltage
they're supposed to be putting out or
your chip is dead so you know that kind
of thing you don't need to worry about
them that much if you're on a liquid
nitrogen it can sometimes help to change
the voltage on the PAX rail but even
that is just like not not necessary like
not always necessary so that kind of
covers all the different yorams we have
on here now let's get into the major
sort of up well into the details of them
and this is where the big upgrades start
with the 20 series so with the 20 series
NVIDIA has apparently gotten UPI
semiconductor to make a new voltage
controller say hello to the you p90 512
it is a whole plus one over the you p90
511 which you had on the entire 10
series so you p95 11 was the predecessor
that was on the 10 series and there's
actually a massive
difference between these two chips even
though the numbers got only gone up by
one like I'm honestly surprised that
they've not made this a whole new like
lineup like a ninety six eleven but now
is ninety five twelve and the changes
are huge so the ninety five eleven you
had a maximum switching frequency of six
hundred kilohertz per phase the 9512
goes up to two megahertz per phase this
means if you're running a doubling
scheme you can actually still cram one
megahertz per phase which is more than
enough to max out any power stage or
really any transistor configuration so
that's a nice upgrade they still both
output you know there's still both eight
phase outputs so configurable up to
eight phases for both of them but the U
P 9512 adds in the new addition of an sm
bus so fun fact about the ninety-five
eleven if you have a ten series GPU and
you check your V core reading that week
we're reading is not actually V core at
all its literal like the there's
physically no way for those cards to
monitor the vrm output voltage because
the u p95 eleven doesn't have a digital
like digital circuit to report how much
voltage it's outputting at all so you
don't actually know how much voltage a
gtx 10 series card is actually running
on you just know what the driver is
telling the chip to produce so you don't
know how much load line is on top of
that you don't know anything really
about the output voltage with the 9512
the sm bus is not fully detailed yet but
it is supposed to do monitoring
functionality so like the RM output
current should be possible to monitor
vrm operating temperature should be
possible to monitor assuming that the
arm has temperature sensors built in
which certain power stages will have you
can also just use temperate like add to
temperature sensors of your own if
you're the PCB manufacturer it should
also support voltage readouts and may or
may not support well it's also supposed
to make it possible to change
configurations of the voltage controller
however there's no details on what
exactly you'll be able to configure I'm
assuming switching frequency will be
configurable
loadline calibration may be configurable
and some other operating parameters for
the vrm may be configurable but really
we need the like I I really want UPI to
publish the full datasheet for this chip
because it'll be interesting to see what
exactly will be available and I really
hope they like publish the full
datasheet with the actual register map
for this because if they do make the
register map public that would mean you
would have access to things like
switching frequency through software
essentially so that would be really
really neat functionality to have on
these cards and that like makes me
excited about this new chip because the
9512 is essentially on par in terms of
features at this point with things like
the International rectifier 3595 which
was basically the voltage controller of
choice for cards like the gtx 980ti
kingpin edition the lightening of the
galaxy all of fame all of those cards
were on a high AR 3595 a and at this
point the 9512 basically matches that
could match that on the the feature set
and that would be really really cool
if it actually did because well that
would mean your reference PCBs would be
just that much better to start with so
that's the 95 12 you know major major
like that's the big different like as
far as I'm concerned that's the big
difference between the V RMS of a GTX 10
series card and the GTX 20 series this
chip like that because it's the it's the
brain of the V R M so of course that's a
major difference the other interesting
difference is is that apparently they
these cards are so damn expensive and so
profitable to produce that it makes
sense to put this lovely new high end
voltage controller literally everywhere
because this this chip right here is
actually controlling the two phase
memory of erm which is just like you
know
yeah let's smack an eight phase voltage
controller on a two phase the there's
another up4 you p90 512 on this card for
the V curve erm because it's actually
single output like it goes up to eight
phases but it's single output there's
some other chips where you can go like
eight phases and they'll support things
like 6 + 2 5 + 3 4 + 4 7 + 1 but the
9512 is single output so it's
you know anything from one to eight
phases but only one output so if you're
not using half of the phases well
they're just kind of don't get used to
do anything the other ninety five twelve
is roughly in this area of the PCB I
unfortunately do not have a full board
like full PCB shot off to the back of
the card
and that one's for controlling the V
curve erm so somewhere in that area we
have another one and that one is running
in six phase mode and this V R M as much
as it wants to look like a twelve phase
is not a twelve phase there is certainly
twelve you know twelve sets of inductors
and twelve sets of power stages but
there is no doublers on this and the
9512 can't control twelve phases it only
goes up to eight so what you essentially
have is that you have groups of 2 power
stages and two inductors at the same
time that are basically synchronized and
since they're not out of phase with each
other it's not fair to call them sexpert
phases alright because the whole point
of phases is is that it's the state of a
signal relative to another signal and if
you have two says if you have two phases
on us it like if you have two phase
power that means you have to offset
power signals basically well power
outputs that are offset from each other
by you know phase separation and you
don't have that here for 12 phases you
only have six so this is a basically a
ginormous six phase when I say ginormous
I mean ginormous because same as the GTA
as the Titan V I keep forgetting that
they were if that thing is not a GTX
Titan but the Titan V uses a very nice
70 amp power stage from Fairchild
Semiconductor called the F DMF 31 70 the
20 series cards at least the reference
PCB for the GTX 20 80 and the reference
PC VG for the gtx 28 ET i as well as
this PCB here for the FTW three card all
use this power stage and there's 12 of
them in parallel so this is ridiculous
overkill um this this is really really
really really
be powerful as far as GPU VRMs go
honestly this is not this this is
comparable to some of the
top-of-the-line cards on the like
top-of-the-line GTX 10 ATT eyes now I do
wonder if this is actually necessary
because as far as as far as I know 12
nanometer TSMC still doesn't scale with
voltage so if you're on our air cooling
or water cooling you're never actually
gonna get anywhere near using the
capability of this VR M but you know
there's nothing wrong with having way
more viewers at least if the half of the
phases failed you'd still have more of
erm than you need redundancy yeah
which actually I do think the FD MF 31
seventies these are like smart power
stages if I remember correctly these
actually do support like drop it like if
they've malfunction they're just gonna
drop out and the VR M can keep running
like nothing happened so that's you know
that's kind of neat you basically have a
nice redundant six phase vrm as a end
result now then in terms of actual heat
output figures for this VR M it gets a
bit complicated because as much as I
like the FBM F 30 170 the data sheets
for this thing respect entirely a 1.8
volts out 502 kilohertz switching
frequency which the 500 killer switching
frequency is not a problem the 1.8 volts
output is because that's gonna drive up
the heat output of each power stage for
any given current level so if you're
pushing you know say 50 amps at 1.8
volts it's gonna produce more heat than
if you're pushing 50 amps at 1.2 volts
out so that means that all of the heat
output figures I'm gonna give you right
now are a bit high or maybe very high I
don't know because the datasheet doesn't
say how these scale with output voltage
they do scale with input well like there
is a graph for scaling with input
voltages like not exactly useful
international like there's a lot of
other power stages which actually give
you details for scaling with input ball
with output voltage and the differences
are quite significant most of the time
but it also depends on the internal
design of the
stage you could theoretically make one
that doesn't really care how much output
voltage you have or that would actively
get worse as you lower the output
voltage if you had a really weak low
side MOSFET and a really strong high
side then you'd slowly run into an issue
of the since as as you out lower the
output voltage more and more of the
current goes through the low side MOSFET
and if the low side most that sucks well
then your power your heat output is
gonna go up and up and up as as you
lower the output voltage so you know the
the are basically the vrm heat output
figures here are gonna be off by some
amount in some direction I'm not sure
probably upwards I think they're
probably a bit too high but unless you
know I get a beta better datasheet
detailing how these actually scale with
output voltage I can't really do
anything about this so let's go through
the various current figures so I don't
know how much these cards are actually
going to pull Sorge is gonna go in
increments of a hundred starting in two
hundred amps because that seems like a
like reasonably close to where this
probably runs and I'm assuming these
probably run on around a hundred and
eighty amps at one volt but I'm not sure
so two hundred amps output you're gonna
be looking at about 21 watts of heat
output three hundred amps output you're
gonna be looking at about 35 watts of
heat output four hundred amps output
you're gonna be looking at about 50
watts of heat output now this like all
of this is still very cool about and
especially if you were at a lower output
voltage in the the heat outputs go down
like this vrm should have no problem and
Allah 400 amps if you just throw enough
airflow at it and reasonably sized
heatsink so I really wonder what's gonna
happen with the 28 e TI v RMS for like
the extreme overclocking parts like the
galaxy all of fame or the kingpin
addition I'd really love to know what
they're gonna do if this is what they're
putting on an FTW 328 e cuz that's the
main thing like this chip is much much
smaller than the 28 e TI one so you know
one could one would assume that the 28 e
TI is gonna pull more
like a lot more power than a 20 80 once
you you know take the chains off so to
speak 500 amps output this is where the
heat output starts getting like pretty
significant but again keep in mind 1.8
volts out so it could be it would
probably be lower if the output voltage
wasn't so high 500 amps output you'd be
looking at about 72 watts of heat and
it's 600 amps output you'd be looking at
a little over a hundred watts at 102
watts of heat so realistically anything
up to 400 amps should be perfectly
doable for this vrm assuming you know
you still have enough cooling if you
don't have enough cooling you're
probably gonna be limited to around the
200 amp range but like don't have any
active airflow you're probably gonna end
up around the 200 amp range about
otherwise up to 400 to be totally doable
I really do want to know what they're
gonna do for the 2080 TI's like because
this is ridiculous so yeah really really
impressive six-phase but at this point
like after the Titan V I'm not sure that
I'm surprised anymore because the Titan
we had basically like same power stages
massive eight phase where there was two
power stages per phase two inductors per
phase so it just kind of looks like an
Nvidia has just decided you know what
everybody gets 70 M power stages and
they can just build whatever they want
out of them
package deal you buy a you buy a t you
die and you get yourself a bunch of 79
power stages to use though use with it
and so yeah it'll be interesting to see
what the other manufacturers come up
with because this is really really
impressive and massive massive overkill
now then for the memory vrm they're
still using those 70 M power stages
which just is like it's insane it's a
memory of erm this thing's never gonna
push more than like 20 amps if it's even
gonna push 20 M because GDD are six is
supposed to pull less power than gddr5
so a little bit less power or I think
them maybe the same amount of power is
gddr5 X
for the same amount of you know
bandwidth so on maybe even a higher
bandwidth so otherwise the efficiency
wouldn't really go up would it if it
pulled more power at higher frequencies
so yeah and even gddr5 which is more
power hungry than GDD are six or gddr5 x
really doesn't pull that much current
either so this is ridiculously insane
overkill and that straight-up doesn't
need a heatsink at 20 amps output that
vrm would generate about 2 watts of heat
and I don't think it would actually ever
have to push 20 amps and that's again
assuming 1.8 volts you know so at one
point 3 5 volts that would very likely
be well under 2 watts and this thing is
huge if you just have some moderate
airflow over it you should have no
problem cooling itself and if you went
all the way up to 40 amps which I really
don't think G DDR 6 is ever gonna pull
even if you started over vaulting it and
overclocking it to the moon it'll
produce about 4 watts of heat we just
still nothing for such a you know lot
like it's a two-phase it's huge there's
a lot of surface area on the basis of
just being two phases so basically this
is this this is really really impressive
that's all there really is to say about
this PCB is this is really really
impressive it's just so unfortunate that
they stuck that memory of erm right
where they did because there's no way
you're ever gonna run this on liquid
nitrogen because you need to move those
inductors I assume they do not clear
lnto pulse because they're probably too
damn tall yeah that makes it like this
this thing makes me pretty excited to
see the rest of the twenty eighty twenty
eighty PCBs because if this is what you
know EVGA is managed to come up with for
the FT w3
I mean maybe all the other manufacturers
decide to just like cut costs because
it's like you don't need this you're
just gonna get a six phase or maybe
they'll just all roll with reference
PCBs for their cards because the
reference PCB as far as I'm aware is
just a straight-up eight phase which
already with this 70 M power stage the
like freaking eight phase is already
ridiculous
for you know for your typical air-cooled
or even water-cooled overclocking so
yeah very very impressive from EVGA here
it'll be interesting but it's just like
it's ridiculous like it's so impressive
it's ridiculous at this point because
this honestly puts to shame a loss of
extreme overclocking cards from from the
past and you know especially we're now
with the upgrade of the you p90 512 of
the upgrades to the you p90 512 like you
may not need a kingpin Edition 20 atti
to break World Records at this point
like it's well no you you might want
like the main difference between like
what I expect to happen is like the main
difference between a kingpin Edition 20
atti and like a lightning 20 80 TI and a
hall-of-fame 20 TTI is that they have
better software volt like they have full
software controls for the VRMs assuming
Nvidia allows those to go public but
there's gonna be internal tools for that
kind of capability for those cards
whereas other cards won't have that and
that's the only difference I can really
think of that that's gonna occur because
as far as the actual component tree goes
like this is more than enough that this
is plenty like I said you couldn't you
don't need more so yeah I'm really well
I like I'm really interested to see what
the rest of the cards look like at this
point because you know for for the first
time in ages
it's like improving over the the
reference design from Nvidia like this
is still a step up from the reference
design but I think at this point it's
really I'm like unnecessary so yeah
it'll be just very interesting to see
the rest of the cards in my opinion
because we might see some cards which
actually opt to just down cost the vrm
to try drive down the price point
because honestly I think what's coming
out at the the price point that the
founders additions are at this is
massive overkill like you you don't need
this with all probability but it might
be too early to judge who knows maybe
TSM sees his new 12 nanometer process
scales to 1.5 volts and the card pulls
800 watts on air cooling that would be
uncool below 500 watts on air cooling
that would be cool
so and at that point this VR I might
make a modicum of sense but otherwise
it's just like well even then 1.5 volts
for 500 watts you'd be looking at like
little over 300 amps output which would
still be very you know very reasonable
in terms of the heat so yeah that's it
for the video I mean there's nothing
left to say this is insane
thank you for watching if you like share

if you'd like to support gamers Nexus
here then we have a patreon there's also
a store which I think goes stored gamers
Nexus dotnet but either way you can find
a links links to both of those things
down below in the description or the
comments section and also if you'd like
to check out more extreme overclocking
content like this I have a channel
called actually hardcore overclocking
where I do a lot of stuff like this so
yeah that's it for the video
