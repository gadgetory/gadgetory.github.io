nexus Donette and we were playing the
demo of gleed today if you saw bleed was
covered in our first green light
spotlight episode our first-ever one and
it was the number one game for that week
so I have contacted the developer he
sent me a link to where I could get his
demo and that's what we're playing right
now let's play this on hard mode cuz I
want to fail miserably I have not
actually played this through yet
although stormed the thing and kill copy
okay so we have to kill someone named
guppy I'm sure he's a friendly guy so
this game is a pretty sweet platformer I
wonder if I can go up here it's actually
it reminded me a lot of contra which is
why I wanted to play it originally
because I saw a lot of that retro style
in it we just I can't go out
mouse button the shoot yeah yeah yeah
okay so this is what I wow this is
really these controls feel fluid this is
what I liked a lot about the video I saw
the of the game when I first covered it
is how fluid the mechanics look and as
you can see I mean I picked this up
pretty quickly you basically just push
spacebar and you fly all over the place
and that's the core mechanic looks like
you can one two three it looks like you
can triple jump actually and I think you
can jump off of walls I'll try that in a
little bit I think you can jump off of
walls they're just switch to queue for
the rocket launcher sweet figure of it
I'm not sure that number means that I
guess that number the top right is just
points yes it is just points so we're
just trying to get a high score that
seems like our goal hold down the room
oh gosh hold down the right button too
slow sweet
so we can slow time
and do anything down here nope nope
that's a whole death don't want to go
down the hole of death although I did
while jump out then sweet so while
jumping does does indeed work and I'm
out of jumps so I'm gonna wall jump my
way back up here up just kidding i'm not
gonna while John my way back up there no
fear the first level supposed to be easy
she says
alright so use my shift like it told me
to and killed the bad guy our health is
in the top left if you haven't noticed
yet we all stubble jump easy okay and we
also have a time identifier which as you
saw in the trailer if you watch the
trailer or green light episode one you
know that the timer is just as a second
ago because you can slow time down so
use that wisely I suppose this is what I
need to be doing here
wow these things are just coming in from
all over the place not really sure what
they are they look kind of purple let's
try out this rocket launcher bitch shall
we
sweet
it's a bit slow though
yeah this is actually I know I've said
this a couple times now but the controls
do feel very fluid and I'm low health
but I'll take I'll take some comfort
knowing that it's hard mode at least
and I believe that's how the game is
supposed to be played except for the
part where I get hit by a fuzzy death
ball looks kind of like a Tribble or
something from Star Trek I'm not quite
sure what that was there nope this is
the checkpoint
I probably don't need to kill that guy
to move forward yeah
wow that was fun
that time mechanic is really fun so the
demo is free from what I understand
after reading in the blurb from the
developer it is only one level right now
and challenge mode which I also haven't
tried yet so we'll give challenge about
a shot after this I suppose I have a
sneaking suspicion that there will be a
boss and if I can ever pass this part
all right here we go
yeah there we go that's what I needed
that's not what I needed more of these
they never quit come I do they
oh gosh all that is so cool all of the
mechanics feel really good about this
game especially for something that is in
just a demo really impressed with the
mechanics which to me are the most
important part of the game I know a lot
of people are fans of good art or a good
story those are pretty important
obviously you know we wouldn't have an
industry without them but to me it's
mechanics that keep you returning and
that's why i love these platformers that
remind me of contra and other early
platformers silver server was a stupidly
art game with not the best mechanics in
the world but it was a very hard game
for those of you that played the NES of
the Silver Surfer
Oh
so this game bleed was in the microsoft
dream build play I think that's what
it's called a competition microsoft runs
for small and startup game developers
and geez i'm not having luck here it was
i don't know if it was i can't remember
if it one or if it was a finalist but i
remember being there and seeming to have
good reception I can definitely see why
oh jeez okay if I use this time mechanic
a little bit more
cool gotta get used to switch into that
rocket launcher too looks like we're
going up higher oh jeez
is please let me back please respond
it's not letting me back in so up we go
shoo
oh jeez oh jeez
uh no bonked by the missile Bullet Bill
clearly the objective here
shift also slowed it down
i was using right click
ah there we go that time mechanic let
them fire the bullets missiles bullets
and up we go
okay now we have to fight the chopper ah
please just behind help back up and the
story I mean if you call it a story it's
not really necessary in a platformer as
we all know but the story here is that
you there are no more heroes and your
goal is to become the ultimate video
game hero or something along those lines
any different made it but it's still at
like full health I need to figure out
that one still
yeah there we go still loving this the
feel of the game is solid I just got to
figure out the boss I'm sure doing a
YouTube video doesn't help me figure the
boss out also doing the hardware videos
all day
it's uh not quite on time but I did
manage to save my time feature oh cool
you can blow the missiles up
this is a good thing
oh so close caught by the rotor I'm out
of time things ok ok guys I got this
last one
let's do this
sleepily got it
BAM what now
you got some more missiles is what now
is there a way to like sprint I need a
sprint trying to double tap directional
keys but it's not working yes there's
only jumping in this one here we go and
failed but it's almost dead look at that
health
how are they climactic just stood there
let the times right now unwisely
ok it's dead ?
that confirmed I guess we still have to
find this Rosie called globby guppy
there's guppy I'm at zero health I
really hope it check pointed
but will fight on just to study what is
what his moves are I supposed to call
them okay his moves are don't jump into
him
so here we go this time for sure
except I'm ready I have held maybe next
time
okay killed some of those stop worrying
about this for a minute I'm going to
switch back to these guns so I can seems
a little bit better for this mob
kills things faster of course
okay preserving that time stat
oh that multiplied
Wow multiplying again geez
out of jumps got to fall down and out of
time oh crap
Jesus like a pro
nah 2 left 2 just one more shot
all right but I'm sure this is several
cuts later at this point but you have
another go at this
I feel like this is a maybe solid 10
minutes of trying and dying now
but that is what i get for play on hard
mode
okay one more down you gotta too many
down
there's that using the time element
wisely very hard mechanic to master oh
my gosh because if you use it all at
once it will have to recharge again
there we go level cleared 10 or 15
minutes later all in that time element
you just gotta let time you kind of
stagger it staggers debit shutter step
it and it will it will not stall you out
while it's recharging that gives you
full ability to utilize it while it's
still charging
sure so that was guppy is there another
level she rates right to left apparently
the worms normal this time and that's
the end of the demo okay then
okay guys I gave challenge right a try
it is a nothing really to worth posting
on the video because it's just fighting
the two bosses the helicopter and guppy
in a smaller environment and it's much
harder so with that what do I think of
this game I think from a design
perspective it is a platformer of course
it is a fast-paced platformer and it
knows that that's what it wants to be it
has very good mechanics just I mean I'm
really impressed by how right the
mechanics feel when you're playing the
game it's it's very satisfying to use
all of the different options like while
jumping and triple jumping and in the
freeze element as I mentioned many times
and then of course the weapons I did
feel like I probably should have chosen
normal difficulty not hard but so be it
that was my choice what it does prove is
that the developer does a good job of
scaling difficulty I went back and
played normal it was much easier but not
so easy that I wanted to quit so the
developer does a good job at scaling
difficulty I'd like to see a few more
mob types but obviously those will come
with more levels as far as what I think
needs to be improved I really think the
biggest thing here is the cursor I'm not
sure if I told fraps to record my cursor
or not but if you can't see it's a tiny
white square about the size of the
characters I hear and
it's it's easy to lose track of in the
game so I think maybe better player
feedback for the reticle when they're
firing maybe a better color or something
that stands out so it's because i kept i
noticed i kept aiming at the wrong thing
and it wasn't because I didn't know
where the thing I wanted to shoot was it
was because my mouse was not where I
thought it was because the feedback was
easy to lose track of so with all of
that in mind I think you should go try
this demo immediately if you like this
kind of game and I I'm looking forward
to a full release I know the developer
told me that he is looking at a couple
of months from now he has not given a
specific date and a couple months from
now I don't I think that's just going to
be a demo version I don't or a more
extended version i should say i don't
know that it's going to be the full game
but i will let you all know of course so
as more updates come out on bleed stay
tuned on gamers nexus tonight and on our
youtube channel and please like this
video if you liked it comment subscribe
share all of those great things and i'll
see you guys next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
