530 600 X the $50 more expensive
counterpart to the r5 3600 that we
already gave a high review the 3600 x
like the previous 2600 X or 1600 X
counterparts and the previous
generations is functionally just a
higher clocked 3600 out of the box
without the need to do anything to reach
those clocks and that's about all it is
there's no difference in core count
there's no difference in cash there's no
difference in anything except for the
frequencies out of the box and it's an
extra 50 bucks so what we're looking at
today is is it worth actually paying 25
percent more for the amount of
performance you gain we'll be looking at
a more limited set of benchmarks for
this one because it's pretty
straightforward before that this video
is brought to you by coursers hydro x
water coin series of course our strength
is bringing water cooling to the masses
and it has built out cooling solutions
with industry leaders to help newcomers
get into open-loop cooling of course
hair has fittings adaptors GP water
blocked CPU water blocks pump has combos
and radiators all available in the hydro
X line as you can see in our footage
these kits can be used to build the
beautiful open loop systems
learn more at the link in the
description below so if we're going over
the benchmark charts in a bit we won't
be rehashing the same thing we did in
the 3600 you we're not going to be
comparing the 3600 x versus all the
competing intel parts all the old gen am
deep parts the numbers will be on the
chart but not gonna read through it if
you want to see that comparison check
the 3600 view it's the same thing for
this one all we're doing is looking at
the 3600 x versus the 3600 and if it's
worth it that's really all we care about
for this one separately we're not going
to show every single game and every
single production workload because the
story is more or less told within just a
couple of the charts so no need to go
through 30 minutes of the same numbers
and overclocking we were able to get the
3600 X to the same frequency as every
other Rison chip we've worked with so
far which is 4.3 gigahertz all core we
could not overclock it manually past
that point and as far as the question of
PBO that's in a separate video of ours
if it's not up already it will be
shortly so yeah 4.3 gigahertz if you're
at 4.3 all core of 3600 X it's gonna be
the same as 4.3 all core in the 3600
just like the 1700 acts the same clocks
as an overclocked 1700 would give you
the same results so those numbers will
not be in the chart because you can just
look at the 3600 at 4.3 and that's what
it is higher performance is seen largely
in the scenarios where it is seen
because of the higher single core
frequency so that's the biggest deal
here so when you do see a higher
performance it's typically because the
boosting frequency with a single or
single core dual thread scenario is
going to be higher with the XQ then with
the not XQ it's just a question of again
does it matter is it worth it so let's
get into the numbers this will be a
pretty easy one today will go through
games a couple of them a couple of
production workloads and then power
Assassin's Creed origins is an
interesting demonstration as it shows
performance scaling with both frequency
and cores for the r5 3600 X the result
ends up being 118 FPS average which
pushes beyond the 4.3 gigahertz all core
3600 OC of 116 FPS average and this we
think is because of the dual threat
boost of the 3600 X being 4.4 gigahertz
whereas the 3600 OC was locked to 4.3
gigahertz all core and will never hit
4.4 that extra 100 megahertz on two
threads helps in some scenarios like
this one
scaling versus the 3600 stock result is
3.1 percent higher we clocked the 3600
x2 4.3 gigahertz all core but it's
literally the same as the r5 3600 once
you overclock them to the same settings
so there's no point in going through all
the retesting again the 1440p result
shows the same thing the 3600 X scales
better with its limited thread boosting
than the 3600 OC unsurprisingly that's
how we can move on to the next game f1
2018 is next and likes frequency and IPC
for this one the r5 3600 x stock CPU
ends up at 1% ahead of the 3600 CPU the
3600 at 4.3 gigahertz lands at 231 FPS
average or 0.5% ahead of the 3600 x
stock with an error predictably 1440p
has all tests within error margins of
one another we are not able to determine
a difference of this test and they are
all functionally equal civilization 6
provides a look at turn
time processing on average in the
seconds rather than FPS the r5 3600 Acts
completes the average turn in 35 seconds
with a 3600 completing the average turn
in 36 seconds civilization is more
frequency dependence than other games
again clearly illustrated by the 9900 K
5.1 gigahertz result exactly matching
the 9700 K 5.1 results and so the 3600
acts benefits from a 2.8 percent time
requirement reduction in exchange for
the 25% higher cost the all core OC is
close but not quite there GTA 5 has the
3600 acts at 106.8 FPS average or tied
with the 4.3 gigahertz all core OC 3600
results of 106 FPS average we normally
round to the nearest whole number for
these but when the difference is what it
is here might as well read it out the r5
3600 stock CPU finishes with a 104.3 FPS
average again there's no real benefit
here although differences are measurable
they are indistinguishable to the end
user they are not perceptible all the
but you can measure them with software
so this couldn't be nearly gone with an
all core OC once again and even that is
not particularly worth it
1440p results are the same again with
barely any difference between the 3600
SKU CPUs we are at 103.5 FPS average at
the low end and 106 point 2 FPS average
at the high end ignoring the 3600 smt
off result of 108 point 2 FPS average
the 3600 to 3600 x gain is 2.6 percent
in exchange for 25% more money shadow of
the Tomb Raider is among our last two
games
the 3600 acts ends up at 140 FPS average
which places it as tied with the 3600
all core OC of 139 FPS average and
imperceptibly ahead of the r5 3600 stock
CPU gaining just 1.7 percent
hitman 2 with dx12 tested the 3600 acts
at 117 FPS average lowers within
reasonable run to run variants of the
others this results positions the r5
3600 as 1.7 percent the head of the 3600
stock CPU are particularly impressive
and tied with the r5 3600 4.3 gigahertz
all core OC 1440p key
the scaling and positioning just with
everything slightly lower the r5 3,600 X
ends up at 115 8.6 FPS average with the
3600 at 114 FPS average the overclocked
is functionally tied with the 3600 X
once again moving on to a couple of the
production tests because frankly it's
it's really not worth showing all of
them at all well just show three here a
7-zip is next for this one we test
compression and decompression these
results like almost all the others are
an average of averages so we're looking
at a lot of data points for each
benchmark and we're averaging the
average his which gives us a pretty
accurate number the test is measured in
millions of instructions per second
which will abbreviate as MIPS the r5
3600 x lands at 56,000 595 myths for
compression which expectedly ties it
with the 3600 overclock and as the two
with an error of one another first of
the stock 3600 the improvement is the
same as the 4.3 gigahertz all core 3600
it's 2.5 percent uplift as the maximum
we gain meaning that $50 it gets you 2.5
percent over baseline making this a hard
argument over aim these cheaper option
even ignoring the overclocking
decompression is next for this chart the
3600 acts ends up at 72,000 maps
allowing the 4.3 gigahertz all core 3600
elite of 70 4600 MIT's
or a 3.4 percent increase in performance
thanks to the fixed all core frequency
versus the r5 3600 CPU the 3600 ex sees
an increase of just 3% Adobe Photoshop
is next as we mentioned in the 3600
review this is a heavily frequency bound
workload which means that the rise in
CPU is in general fall below Intel's for
our comparison today the 3600 acts ends
up at 966 points where higher is better
as a calculation of transform warp
filter and other effects the r5 3600
stock CPU ends up at 950 seven points
the improvement over stock is 0.9
percent with a 3600 at 4.3 gigahertz
allowing an additional jaunt of 1.3
percent over the 3600 X in this scenario
just going with the 3600 makes the most
sense the array is a render made by Kaos
group a lot of the workstation users in
our
have asked us to benchmark this one
lately so here's what we came up with
for CPU performance 3,600 X finishes the
round around the CPU one point for three
minutes which is 0.02 minutes or one
point two seconds ahead of the r5 3600
stock CPU the Delta is hardly even
measurable it's actually it's it's right
on the edge of where the our data
accuracy cuts off the decimal point stop
after the hundredths for this test so
measurable certainly not perceptible and
measurable only with a lot of test
passes so no difference once again power
consumption has measured at the 12 volt
rails is up next in blender this has the
r5 3600 X at roughly 80 Watts about
equal with the r5 3600 in the same
workload the overclocked to 4.3
gigahertz on the 3600 pushes it to 90
watts which is because we've had to
increase the voltage significantly to
hold stability in this test as a
reminder we test the Intel CPU properly
by disabling MCE and allowing turbo
boost limits to exist as spec defines
and exiting spec would allow higher
power consumption obviously so you would
see higher numbers here if you enable
the MCE on say an asu sport there's no
meaningful change in power consumed in
this test for the 3600 versus the 3600
acts when both are stock for gaming
power consumption the r5 3600 acts ends
up consuming about the same power as the
3600 lining at 55 watts for this
workload overclocking doesn't blow out
the consumption here as we're altima
tolima today what the application
demands which is comparatively little
when looking at blender previously over
all them there's a 25% increase in price
between the 3600 and the 3600 acts and
the performance increases don't even
come close to matching that CPU is at
the high end of the line can get away
with price bumps like that because
customers spending $400 plus on a CPU
want to have the biggest numbers the
most core is the highest frequency no
matter what the 3600 acts is towards the
last expensive end of the Rison 3000
stack so it has to justify every dollar
it costs over the next CPU down or in
this case the next CPU up as well and
again as a reminder like b7 the 3600
review some of a.m. these biggest
competition this generation is its
previa
half step generation 2000 series
processors are on pretty sharp sales
right now the 2600 X we've seen around
$160 give or take which is a really good
deal for a processor that we were pretty
happy with the 2600 is even cheaper you
want to follow the same advice as in
this review you could even step down to
a 2600 around $140 these days overclock
it's a 4.0 or 4.1 and you'd effectively
have a 2600 X that said obviously
there's a performance increase with a
3000 series so it just kind of depends
on how much money you're willing to
spend and where you need to pinch
pennies and that's entirely up to your
situation but for the 3600 X we come to
the same conclusion we've come to often
in the past which is you're really only
buying this thing if actually it's even
harder to justify than the previous ones
with the previous generations like the
1600 we could say look there's a pretty
big jump in performance if you overclock
it it's easy to overclock just throw in
all core OC on there 3.9 gigahertz way
before and you have a really damn good
processor that can beat the stock 1600 X
but that was a different time now with
overclocking where it is with rising
3,000 more or less being pushed to the
max even that angle is difficult where
you're within a couple percentage points
like 3 max on average anyway between the
3600 to the 3600 X both stock so a 3%
performance gain sort of at the best is
just not really worth it and not worth
$50 so for almost everyone we would say
3,600 over the 3600 X if you really want
the 3600 X it's probably because you
care enough about that couple percent
that you're willing to pay $50 for it to
get a higher single core boost frequency
because that's what you're getting with
it in terms of out of the box back in
terms of overclocking if your intent is
to buy a rise in CPU throw an all core
OC on there and never touch it again it
doesn't matter what you buy technically
the 3600 and the 3600 X overclocked to
the same value will produce the same
numbers but we don't know if the 3600 ax
might be bend a little bit better so
maybe there's some silicon lottery
gambling in there if you buy the 3600
and so the 3600 X we're not sure we
don't have a sample size of hundreds to
check
but that would be the only real
consideration is silicon Bening for
overclocking quality and with these
chips when you're fighting between four
point two and four point three it's sort
of stops mattering especially since the
stock 3600 axis and outperform and all
core ocf four point three in cases where
a single single core dual thread
scenarios would matter so that'll be the
review of short version not worth it we
still really like the r5 3600 and think
that's a fantastic processor at the
price Intel's got some competition
towards the higher end of the stack the
9600 K is not really in in our
consideration for the most part at this
level I won't go over all the reasons
why again in this one if you want to see
it just watch the r5 3600 review or if
you're lazy you could skip to the end of
it we typically don't recommend that
though because you'll miss all the
context and then for an D competition
versus itself the 2000 series like the
2,700 2,700 X those are going to be
similarly priced these days so if you
need the extra cores and you can
sacrifice some of the frequency that
might be a consideration as well thank
