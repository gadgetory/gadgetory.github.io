show the first one was looking at the x5
70 motherboards and now we're back
looking at the GT 76 Titan and this one
is pretty special so we already
previously talked about the actually
with - talked about the Alienware area
51 m or whatever it's called I don't
know their names anymore so we talked
with that when it's got a soccer ball
ninety nine hundred K it's very
interesting because it's a soccer ball
ninety nine hundred K this does the same
thing in that it is a socketable cpu so
if you really wanted to you could
actually replace it I suppose although
will come with the ninety nine hundred
cabe and it's supposed to be
overclockable before that this video is
brought to you by the gigabyte zee 390 a
RS master motherboard which comes
equipped with one of the more powerful z
390 VRMs for heavier overclocks on the
new ninth gen intel cpus the ARS master
is also one of the few motherboards with
a real heatsink this generation
featuring a mix of high surface area
fins and looks oriented cover blocks oh
and it's also got updated RDV
illumination learn more at the link
below
details are not yet final there's even a
sticker on it that says this is an
engineering sample everything you see
today is not 100% final but it's getting
close and the pricing on it is going to
be in the range of maybe 3500 to 5000
depending on the SKU what we're going to
do is take the back off here and just
look at the cooling solution that's on
there today it should be pretty cool as
to what you'll get and talk about the
potential options and bios for
overclocking things like that so you if
msi can make up for where Alienware let
us down in the video with Linus so let's
let's start with the teardown them very
simple here there's a couple screws so
these are all I think Philips and there
shouldn't be any any hidden sneaky
screws and this can't feel any there
we're just gonna pull these out and I
believe this is the only screwdriver we
have and all of Taiwan so hopefully it
will fit hahaha so we've got one two
three four five six screws to go the
solution here it goes up to an RT X 2080
my understanding is that there's not
presently a 20 80 TI solution for
notebook
and thermal is hopefully obviously going
to be the biggest challenge with
anything like this where once you really
start overclocking if you you want to do
a good job on it you do need to remove
power limits and that's where the area
51 fell short it's a tremendously
interesting laptop unfortunately the
thermal designs not particularly good on
the area 51 and even when we did the
special cooling solution that we did
with Linus which was to open it and put
a liquid cooler on it and attach it to a
chiller at below zero degrees Celsius it
was still very limiting and that's
because the BIOS didn't have enough
options for us MSI has a few more
options in BIOS that we've seen so far
and that makes it promising for the for
the student our limits okay so I have
this I have this remove by the team to
make sure I don't damage the engineering
sample here so let's let's talk about a
few things first of all this is
important and I didn't mention it yet
this is a a dual power adapter so you've
got two power adapters plugging into one
cable this is a custom cable plugs into
the laptop
there are we've talked about this ages
ago with the CyberPower notebooks at MSI
also makes where the 2's are power
adapters kind of stop at around 300
watts for certification reasons and
practicality reasons so these connect
into one and then you have your power
break that can I steal a laptop and
there's what the connector looks like on
the end that goes into the adapter the
the item that merges them so that's
important you do need a lot of power for
this we had power limit options and BIOS
haven't tested them but they do seem to
go up to at least 600 watts which is
great if it works and ICC maxes in there
as well which is an issue we had with
the Alienware one there was no ICC max
control you really don't have to go too
crazy on it to get an extra boost in
overclocking but yeah we're still just
didn't give us enough to work with so
again even though Linus and I did the
chilled water approach you should be
able to still overclock reasonably high
on the cooler in there and I just didn't
do it this one does have a bit more calm
of a cooler so there are a lot of fans
there's two that we can see exposed
right here and is it two more fans so
for for fans total the additional two
fans that are not revealed presently are
going to be on this side and they're
sort of in this territory of the
notebook but we're not going to going to
be able to see those today because we're
only opening the bottom so you have to
see the two on the bottom and then for
the cooling solution we have it looks
like ten millimeter heat pipe with a
couple of eights so CPU that's energy P
over here and actually as as I've just
realized you can check by looking at the
socket so there is an Intel ILM in there
and that's what's kind of cool about
these these types of notebooks that's
what's exciting about them even if it
may not be the the most common use case
for a notebook it's an interesting one
because that's actually an Intel
independent loading mechanism that they
use on a motherboard and in fact you can
see part of the clamp right there where
you can release the CPU from the socket
so it's exactly like a standard
motherboard breaking socket the CPU
let's see there's one two three four
five heat pipes running through the cold
plate contacting the CPU it's supposed
to be a direct contact cold plate but
we're not going to disassemble that
today and then the rest of its heat
sinking over to these aluminum fin
stacks towards the back of the laptop
where there's a grill and then the air
is going to get pulled and pulled
through one side here and pushed out the
other to cool down the fin stack and the
heap pipes that are connected to it so
cooling solution is pretty big how good
it is will depend on a lot of things and
we're not going to know until we test it
if we do
and again I'll note that this is not a
hundred ton final so some of this should
change color it should be more black out
or gold not not sort of the unfinished
metal look you have here but it gives
you a first look and the battery is is
really just kind of a joke at this point
because honestly you're only going to
use this battery if you're transporting
it from one room to the other this is a
desktop replacement this is not meant to
be something you use on a plane or
something
like that although overclocking on a
plane might be a video idea for the
future so well we'll look into it some
more as we get more information we have
some b-roll shots of the notebook as
well on the top side there's a lot of
RGB LEDs it does go up to a twenty
eighty it goes up to a ninety nine
hundred k the the KS at the time of this
video going live will have just been
announced and so no one really knows
about it but no word on that in here it
is just a 90 100 k preset the five
gigahertz though which I'm aside is
capable of doing with standard 900 case
if they want to memory support 20 26 66
megahertz stock you can do some every
overclocking and bios we have footage of
BIOS to show that off and then the panel
there's a 1080 144 Hertz option and a 4k
option that's IPS so that's what we know
about the notebook for now it's the GT
76 let Emma side know what you think
below obviously this is not a mainstream
consumer ski or this is a Halo product
but halo products are interesting and
can be pretty fun to work with if only
for overclocking a laptop so we'll look
we'll look at this more in the future as
it nears finalization but that's it for
this one check back for MSI x58
