hardcore overclocking here today we're
going to be taking a look at the rx
Vegas Strix Edition from Asus this is
the first of the Vega custom PCB cards
and this one is surprisingly good which
honestly it in some sense you know I
shouldn't be saying that because Asus do
make a point of generally not putting
out subpar PCBs or at least not PCBs
worse than the reference design before
that this video is brought to you by
thermal Grizzly makers of the conductor
not liquid metal that we recently used
to drop 20 degrees off of our coffee
leak temperatures thermal grizzly also
makes traditional thermal compounds we
use on top of the IHS like cryo not and
Hydra not pastes learn more at the link
below with the sort of frontier Edition
PCB and the reference PCB for all the
Vega cards being so ridiculous because
like that PCB is on par with say the
290x lightning I you know I was thinking
it would be pretty hard or very
expensive for manufacturers like Asus
gigabyte and all the rest to actually
manage to produce a PCB better than the
reference design or you know if that
like do they actually care to produce a
PCB better than the reference design so
asus have actually gone ahead and made
made some improvement they have still
kept it a 12 plus one phase vrm design
so 12 phase V core and one phase for the
HBM so exactly the same as the reference
card the vcore vrm is actually made up
of two blocks of phases so you end up
with this kind of weird layout which if
you've seen the reference cards then
this isn't that surprising it's still an
L shape except it's further away from
the GPU core and it's not completely
wrapped around it so you know it's
slightly different layout it's a bit
further that could increase a voltage
drop across the power plane to the GPU
core which you know the voltage
controller can't compensate for that in
which case it's just a little decrease
in vrm efficiency because you're burning
some extra power on the actual power
plane itself
the benefit though to this sort of more
spaced out vrm design that the Strix is
taking is that this should be a lot
easier to cool as this vrm has a lot
more surface area and a lot more copper
to it as in you literally have just all
this copper up here which you know it's
it is covered in a bunch of PCB masks so
it's not the best not the best heat sink
ever but it's still better than nothing
so and the same goes for the power
planes themselves as well as you know
just all the extra area that this vrm
gets which I imagine was done by ASUS
InDesign specifically to try improve vrm
cooling for the card so that's the V
Corps of erm layout now below that you
find the HBM vrm which that's the single
phase and that's exactly the same as the
reference design as well in terms of how
many phases it has you also have on the
PCB these three minor rails and this
should be the auxiliary so that's the
memory controller voltage this sits
typically at 0.9 volts then above that
you find the which well I'm not actually
sure which of these is what because I do
not have the card in hand but I'm going
off of what a frontier Edition or a
reference Vega 64 Vega 56 PCB would have
here and the layout because aces haven't
really changed what is where as the
vcore vrm is still in the general area
of where the vcore vrm is on the
reference card the HBM is basically in
the same place relative same place as on
a reference card so I assume these also
didn't change places in which case this
one up here is the VPP so this is a
supporting voltage for the HBM
it sits at 1.8 volts and it does
basically nothing for overclocking you
do not have to worry about that and
above that you have display drive which
again does nothing for overclocking on
some past generations of AMD cards that
the display drive voltage could help
with black screen issues when running
liquid nitrogen Vega has zero issues I
have very low temperatures it actually
really really likes them except for the
part where the driver currently doesn't
let you set a clock so high enough to
max the card out at low
perjures so yeah but nonetheless those
are the three minor volt three minor
VRMs on the board and they're not really
that important I just point them out
because people because more details more
better obviously anyway let's move on to
the details of the things that actually
matter the V Corps v RM and Asus did
actually manage to make a slight
improvement over the reference design
while keeping the exact same phase count
and the difference is all down to the
MOSFETs or in this case power stages the
reference design uses International
rectifier direct FETs a sixty eight
ninety four and a 68 eleven this right
here uses international rectifier power
stages these are the IR 35 55 ms these
are 60 amp power stages from
international rectifier they're pretty
much the second best power stage that
international rectifier makes asus loves
using these they use them on a bunch of
other boards they use them on a bunch of
GPUs actually they use them on like all
their GPUs that are higher-end
and there are really nice power stages
so the end result of actually this
choice of power stage on this card is
that in comparison to the reference PCB
for 1.2 volts output 300 kilohertz
switching frequency and an assumed
because again I do not have the card in
hand I can't check but I assume this
card runs seven volts gate drive because
if it runs five volt gate drive then
actually there's no improvement over the
reference design at all but if it does
run seven volts gate drive then this vrm
is capable of pushing 200 amps at 18
watts of heat dissipation which is the
same as a reference PCB 300 amps so this
is where normally a Vega boils this is
the normal Vega bias current limit so
300 amps it can push at about 25 watts
of heat dissipation this is actually
about nine Watts better than what the
reference card can do for 300 amps
current output 400 amps you're looking
at about 42 watts of heat output which
is again a bow
11 watts better than the reference
design 500 amps this car does at 65
watts the reference design would do at
about 75 watts so you know it is a small
but constant improvement over the
reference design in terms of vrm
efficiency as it doesn't put out as much
heat as the reference design would and
this maxes out at a whopping 720 amps
theoretical as long as you can keep the
vrm at well below 125 degrees centigrade
well you could go higher than that but
really you shouldn't go above 125 so you
don't want to measure the anywhere in
the vrm area being over 125 degrees
centigrade it could push 720 amps
however the vrm would at that point
produce about a hundred and thirty-five
watts of heat which is quite frankly
uncool about I mean even this 65 watt
figure is going to be an issue to cool
so that 135 one is purely theoretical
but that is the theoretical limit if you
put a big enough heatsink on this vrm
and say a delta fan for airflow so yeah
it is a is a you know it's not a massive
improvement over the reference design
and it's not necessarily gonna change
the if you were running this card and
the reference design on liquid nitrogen
I imagine you probably wouldn't see any
difference between either of them as
this is roughly 10 watts more efficient
than the reference design so you know
it's not a huge difference there but it
is it is a small improvement and you
know the extra efficiency for basically
for free is all I imagine a welcome
thing for anybody using Vega even if
it's like 10 watts compared to a
reference card which really isn't such a
huge difference
so yeah the vcore vrm definitely I have
no complaints about it's still a 12
phase and you know I could say yeah
maybe they should have gone for a 16
phase except the thing is with the
voltage controller that AMD requires
Vega which is this chip right here and
that chip is an IR three five two one
seven this is a six plus two phase
voltage controller maximum you can't
actually run more phases than six plus
two out of it so basically for any P via
PCB while any manufacturer of GPUs using
this voltage controller basically means
that they can only do vrm designs like
twelve which would be two times six
as this vrm is obviously using doubling
you can't buy a twelve phase voltage
controller and in this case the doubling
is done by these chips right here those
are ir35 99s they're really not that
like these aren't anything intelligent
they literally just take a PWM signal
and send every other PWM pulse to the
alternating phase so you know one time
one so in twelve okay you know what I
think you got it the first time I'm not
gonna bother trying to explain how the
how it interleaves the signal but
basically it also does cut the switching
frequency in half so the thirty five
thirty five to one seven would be
pushing out say six hundred kilohertz to
the 3599 and that would then push 300
kilohertz to the two phases in front of
it so something like that for each of
them but anyway the the rme setups
basically are restricted to say 212
which is a 2 x 6 or a 16 which would be
a 4 x 4 this would actually be
problematic
this could arguably end up with worse
voltage a voltage regulation results
than the 12 phase and worse efficiency
than the 12 phase because if you're
running a 4 because at that point the 3
5 2 1 7 isn't seeing a 6 phase vrm and
seeing a four phase and it would be
running all 16 phases like therefore so
you could end up in situations where
like 1 out of the 16 phases is taking
way more load or very little load
because the voltage controller has very
little control over balancing them all
ultimately any large you know doubled up
phase design is going to run run into
that issue as well but at least
you'll have you know at least you'll
have groups of four more groups of four
balanced properly instead of just four
groups of four balanced properly because
it does end up just averaging all four
phases together and sees them as one
single big phase so that that's a bit of
an issue so you're stuck with like a
sixteen phase which is less than ideal
or a twenty phase which that shouldn't
be or a twenty phase which would be a
four times five which wouldn't be that
much worse than a you know that would
are probably always end up being better
than a two times six
but that's twenty phases that's really
expensive to implement and takes up a
ton of PCB space and nobody's gonna
bother with that it's just not worth it
and then finally you could also go for a
twenty four phase but you know if the
twenty phase is expensive and ridiculous
why would anybody do a twenty four so
I'm really really not surprised we're
probably gonna see all the Vega cards
using twelve phase vrm designs I'm
hoping that they all use twelve phases
of the RM designs I hope nobody goes
below that because that would be a
problem but you know I really doubt
we're gonna see a Vega with more than
called phases just because the next step
up that makes kind of sense with this
voltage controller is twenty and twenty
doesn't make sense it's too many phases
so yeah that that's a kind of
unfortunate situation forgive a guy if
it wasn't stuck competing against a 10
atti I sure I'm sure that we could see
something like a you know 20 or 24 phase
of erm equipped Vega lightning edition
or you know matrix additions I'm crazy
ln2 overclocking card but as it stands
the 1080 Ti is just better in the
competitive overclocking scene so
nobody's gonna bother with some or
ridiculously overbuilt vega card not
that that's much of an issue as the 12
phase will be almost like the current
vrm for Vega the reference one is
already plenty and even this marginal
improvement just means more plenty so
I'm not really that disappoint
that we won't be seeing you know more
overkill though twelve phases isn't
really overkill it's just kind of enough
as Vega does get ridiculously
power-hungry once you start pushing the
card the HBM vrm is a you know it's
still a single phase this could be a two
phase I don't see the pike I don't see a
problem with just keeping it a single
phase because the HBM - really doesn't
pull that much power from this VRM
anyway it's going to be in the range of
maybe twenty possibly 30 amps at one
point three five volts you know it's
very low current it doesn't you know you
don't need two phases and ultimately the
HBM currently clocks great I've also
tried extra capacitors on my own Vega
cards for the HBM vrm they haven't made
a single they like they didn't make a
tiny amount of difference no improvement
in overclocking range basically tells
you that the single-phase hpm BRM is
plenty in terms of voltage regulation to
get the clocks as high as they can go at
least without raising HBM voltage the
only issue is raising HBM voltage is
really risky as historically HBM has
been very very sensitive to voltage and
degrading very rapidly at higher
voltages as one point 4 volts only took
a few months to degrade at the HBM one
on a few reacts so over volting HBM - i
wouldn't really recommend either and so
i don't see a problem with the
single-phase vrm design here as you know
there's not there wouldn't really be any
benefit to a to face now for that 20
amps current output the RM would produce
about 1.7 watts of heat again assuming
300 kilohertz switching frequency and
seven volts gate drive and at 30 amps it
would produce about 3.2 watts of heat so
yeah yeah it's negligible amounts of
heat you don't really have to worry
about this VR I'm either no issues here
so
yeah that's that's the card in terms of
the VRMs and you know good on Asus for
actually making some improvement over
the reference design because the
reference design was already really nice
this is slightly nicer it's a little bit
more efficient not a huge amount but you
know every little kind of helps and they
did also make some nice additions to the
PCB but not won over them the cards does
still have a dual BIOS which which means
if you buy a Vega 64 I mean Vega 56
Strix Edition flashing a Vega 64 BIOS
will be pretty much breaks free as if
you screw up the flash for whatever
whatever reason you can use that BIOS
which to recover very very easily from
the from the you know failed flash now
one addition that asus has made to the
card which is kind of cool ignoring of
course all the fan headers and I assume
RGB headers and more RGB headers is
these over-voltage points up here these
are really like I'm not sure if they're
enabled they probably require some extra
soldiering elsewhere on the card as
that's usually what Asus does for these
to make sure that you know you can't
really use these without some specific
information from Asus about how to use
these but ultimately these allow you to
based on their descriptions raised core
voltage memory voltage so that be the
HBM and the VCO VCI so that should be
the VDD CI so that would be the
auxiliary voltage over here this is
really helpful because as of right now
the software voltage limitations for
Vega are far too low for anybody running
say well if you're running water cooling
I think you're still probably gonna want
to stay with with it under 1.3 volts but
if you go on something more extreme like
say dry ice liquid nitrogen you're gonna
be looking at voltages like at least one
point three five volts and they
massively help the card like this card
Allah loves the extra voltage
even on air cooling and water cooling
the card does benefit from extra voltage
it's just a case of it gets really
really really inefficient in terms of
power consumption it just burns like you
know everybody already says Vega is
power-hungry at 1.2 volts once you start
cranking up the voltage these cards will
very quickly exceed say 500 watts power
draw on the eight pins so yeah you know
cool for extreme overclockers not really
useful for any other usage so yeah
