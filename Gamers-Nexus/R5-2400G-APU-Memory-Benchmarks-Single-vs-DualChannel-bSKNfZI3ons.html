make memory interesting memories
commoditization ignoring recent price
trends has made it an item where you
sort of pick what's cheap and just buy
it with something like a and these Raven
Ridge AP use that memory choice could
have a lot more impact than in a budget
gaming PC with a discrete GPU we'll be
testing a handful of memory kits with
the r5 2400 G in today's content
including single versus dual channel
testing where all timings have been
properly equalized we're also testing a
few different motherboards with the same
kits of memory useful for determining
how timings change between boards and
we'll be getting through gaming
benchmarks primarily today rather than
anything with synthetics before that
this video is brought to you by EVGA and
the X 299 dark motherboard for the Intel
high-end desktop CPUs the X 299 dark is
one of the only motherboards on the
market with proper vrm cooling we've
tested this and found a significant
performance increase over those without
active cooling on the prm's this board
was used in our recent attempt to set a
top-10 record in fire strike and you can
learn more about the x-29 dark at the
link in the description below the only
place we're making use of synthetics
will be between switching boards for the
most part with fire strike and times by
this is where synthetics shine we're
avoiding things like Cinebench or non
synthetic production workloads like
blender because they just don't really
fit the content we're going for how does
memory impact gaming performance with
the Raven Ridge AP use so to that end
it's not like we're testing every metric
on the market but we're going through a
lot of them and covering everything from
2400 up to 3200 megahertz and we'll just
kind of see how it looks and then decide
what we're doing for future content
pieces from there we're splitting these
benchmarks into two sections first we'll
show the impact of various memory kits
on performance when tested on a gigabyte
gaming k5 motherboard and then we'll
move over to demonstrate how a few
popular motherboards affect results when
left to auto XMP timings we were
focusing on memory scalability
performance today with a baseline
provided by the previously tested G 45
60 and r3 1200 with GT 1030
that we ran a few weeks ago we'll get to
APU overclocking and a future content
piece but for now we're just
looking at memory before ins for
single-channel testing we're
benchmarking the best kit that we have
out of all the tests we ran which is the
Trident z CL 1430 200 megahertz option
and then we'll look at a couple of the
others along the way rocket league at
1080p and high-ish settings will start
us out for this one our r5 2400 G
operated a 58 FPS average with 3200 mega
Hertz CL 14 Triton Z memory from g.skill
and the 0.1% load is tagged LAN at 18
FPS the GT 1030 and G 4560 would be a
good baseline here for comparison
performing at about 62 FPS average but
was significantly improved frame times
remember the memory for an APU is shared
between the GPU and CPU components when
the GPU component on an APU needs to
access memory it's going to system
memory there's no onboard memory like
you have with gddr5 or HB m2 and because
of that we're dealing with different
types of memory there is a significant
difference between gddr5 which is
physically on the board it has tighter
tie means typically and it's technically
a bit faster for the specific task also
it's physically closer to the GPU than
an APU where it has to travel across
part of the motherboard basically so
this is where the differences start to
emerge with memory and it's why memory
is so important with APU is particularly
when you're talking do-overs a single
channel this is something that as we've
shown recently doesn't really mean a
whole lot when you use a D GPU and a
low-end CPU you could run one stick or
two sticks and as we've shown in a lot
of cases it really doesn't matter that
much
however for something like an APU it can
matter a whole lot as we've just shown
here and that's because the APU actually
really needs access to memory because
the GPU otherwise would be starved for
it it's accessing system memory its
shared memory between the CPU and the
GPU and so it needs to be fast enough to
support both of those devices
simultaneously back to the rocket league
chart keep in mind that our focus today
again is memory so we'll get to APU
overclocking in a later content piece
getting down to the memory comparison on
the r5 apu the next best performing kit
after the CL 14 Trident II was our
corsair lpx memory that AMD provided
with the r7 last year operating at 29 30
megahertz NCL 16 the next one down was
our guile kit also provided by AMD
before the r5 launched operating at 3200
megahertz and CL 16 in this instance
however there's more different than just
the top-level cast timings we'll get to
those toward the end of the content as
it's decidedly more boring than FPS
numbers for most scalability has this
ranking the LP axe and guile kits within
margin of error of one another
effectively equal in performance the 24
hundred megahertz CL 15 Ripjaws 5 memory
from years ago operated at about 48 fps
average marking the top to bottom range
of performance as about 9 FPS between
the Tritons ii and the Ripjaws kits that
plants the 32 hundred megahertz CL 14
tried and zeke hit as 19.8% ahead of the
Ripjaws kit and the Ripjaws unit also
dropped frame times further landing at
13 FPS 0.1% lows finally our single
channel test takes the best kit the
trident z CL 14 memory and tests it with
only one channel firing this lands us at
31 FPS placing the dual channel tried
and zeke it at about eighty percent
ahead in performance we nearly double
performance by operating in two channels
or in most cases adding a stick of
memory if you're considering buying one
versus two so far with only one data
point it looked like builders of apu
systems will definitely want to go dual
channel and dual stick even if it's a
couple dollars more the difference tends
to be 5 to 10 bucks so it's worth it
here for dota 2 we test at high settings
and 1080p using DirectX 11 note that and
the rise in CPUs have traditionally
fallen behind in this particular game so
we would anticipate that performance
behavior would follow through on Raven
Ridge this is more a factor of dota 2
and how it's built as it favors
frequency over threads in a lot of cases
regardless our 2 GT 1030 tests were
bound by the GPU topping out at 63 FPS
average the our 520 400g with triton z
memory maintain an average of 45 FPS
with it lows somewhat low at 19 FPS the
29 33 megahertz LP x kit falls in second
place again for the second time with the
Ripjaws 5 kit outpacing our guile see
all 16 memory by a few FPS the stack
places
and Alpha X memory has functionally tied
and within error margins with the guile
kit not far behind going single channel
nukes performance pretty an output down
to 25 FPS from 45 FPS granting the dual
channel configuration a 79 percent lead
over the single channel configuration
those aren't much different but that's
largely a factor of how this game
generally behaves for csgo with
relatively high settings at 1080p the
baseline tests operated around 111 to
120 FPS average with our highest
performing our 520 400 G non over
clocked at 95 FPS with the Tritons II
memory note also that the r5 lows
maintain a much healthier number this
time marked at 41 FPS for 0.1% and 63
FPS for 1% lows csgo is fully playable
on the r5 2400 G and maintains a
consistent frame to frame interval
during gameplay the next component was
once again the courts are lpx at 29 33
megahertz with CL 16 timings allowing
the Triton Z to lead by about 5.9
percent the guile kits rank roughly
within error of the Ripjaws 20 400
megahertz kit further demonstrating that
this particular kit of memory doesn't
play as well with this specific
motherboard keep in mind that explicit
motherboard tuning for validated memory
kits can impact performance so other
boards may behave differently it's
entirely possible that one board would
not like the Triton xik it at all but
love the guile kit and vice versa the
Ripjaws 520 400 megahertz kit places
lasts about 10 FPS behind the Triton z
kit which results in a lead of about 12%
for the Trident II memory pulling up
Newegg the price difference is about
$230 with a trident ii kit at 16
gigabytes or about 165 for the Ripjaws 5
kit that we used previously again that's
at 16 gigabytes and strictly committing
the exact two kits that we own back to
the chart single channel testing how to
us at 52 FPS average
0.1% low is significantly reduced we
have more frame time variants here than
previously we're about 83% ahead with
the dual channel alternative Triton C
kit Sniper Elite 4 gives us a DirectX 12
test with a sync compute and one which
has been exceptionally well optimized
especially for AMD we're testing at
1080p high as that's what we have the
most data for with standard GPU
benchmarks note that of course you'd
probably dial down to medium for actual
gameplay but we're just looking at
scaling today for this benchmark we
observed the 2400 G outperforming the GT
1030 and G 4560 combination notably
which comes down to an AMD advantage
with sniper elites asynchronous compute
pipeline particularly on the Vega
graphics chip the Tritons ECL 14 kit
ranks about 30 FPS average with it lows
tightly behind and the 29 33 megahertz
kit CL 16 nearly tied in performance
we're beginning to bump against other
limitations here the CL 14 tried and xik
it again lands 12 to 13% ahead of the 24
hundred megahertz Ripjaws 5 kid and the
guy'll kit again demonstrates poor
performance from its auto timings on
this board single channel performance is
significantly behind as well it's just
like previously and just briefly here's
an overwatch chart as well we'll talk
about this more in the article below but
there's not much to say here it's more
of the same scaling that we've seen
previously when tested at medium
settings with 1080p firestrike gives us
a synthetic recap to look at everything
including a quick test we did with a 16
50 megahertz overclock on the AP is Vega
11 GPU which roughly equals or slightly
under performs against the GT 1030 as
for memory performs the Trident Z
kaitlin's our total score about 32 89
which is about 3% ahead of the Corsair
lpx kid or about 5.8 percent ahead of
the guile kit and about 11.6 percent
ahead of the 24 hundred megahertz ripped
off 5 kit versus a single channel we see
a market uplift of 59% in total score
and depending on whether you're looking
at GP or CPU that may increase or
decrease for time spy will just briefly
mention that the overclocked Vega 11
component does well to place ahead of
the GT 1030 build but we'll talk about
that more in a later piece focusing back
on memory the Trident II kit places our
total score at 12:55 which ranks about
11% ahead of the Kyle 32 hundred
megahertz kit that AMD provided for the
RFI review or about 3% ahead of the
29:33 kit once again single versus dual
channel configurations have a tremendous
impact on performance as you can see
here movie
from this the next test is pretty simple
really we didn't go crazy and depth on
it you could really go off the deep end
here and test every motherboard on the
market if you wanted to all we did was
take three or four popular motherboards
that we happen to have and run the same
two kits dial and try and Z through fire
strike and times by with an r5 2400 J
the entire point of this is to determine
if the boards behave any differently if
they have different auto timings applied
when you just apply XMP because it
doesn't always apply the same settings
every single time and we have a separate
table for that after we get through
these last two charts to show though
maybe one or two instances where those
numbers are actually different aside
from just saying the word Auto four
times by the gigabyte gaming k5 with
triton z memory ranked again at 12:55
for its combined score with the pro four
from asrock within our margin of error
these two are effectively equal and the
msi tomahawk scored at 1234 the tried
and xik hit giving us a top-to-bottom
scoring of two percent difference fire
strike positions the gigabyte gaming k5
at the top but also completely within
error of the asrock pro four we were
within about 1% of performance and so
these boards apply timings in a way that
makes them perform functionally
equivalently the tomahawk p3 50 board
lands the Trident Z kit also close
behind between these three boards
there's nothing crazy going on in score
they're all about the same there's a
slight difference in timings though
here's a simplified spreadsheet on the
motherboard auto timings for the Triton
Z kid note that of course different
memory kits may have very different
results here
the Triton Zeke it is fairly popular and
so most boards have explicit support of
this memory our main difference is in TR
FC he has shown here though that doesn't
manifest in huge ways in these quick
synthetics as for memory timing settings
on the main gaming k5 mother would
publish those in the article link below
so the main takeaway here is well one
single versus dual channel does actually
matter a lot with ap use that's not
really news and it's not quite so
important for something like a low end
CPU with a D GPU we did that test a few
months ago and for that configuration
didn't really matter
but for this one it does and that's
because of how ap is worked because
there's no onboard memory with it so if
you are bought it doesn't matter what
kind of memory you're buying you're
planning to play games in APA which you
probably are so they're targeted at then
we would suggest find the kid of memory
you want and then find the version that
has two sticks so you may be two by four
if you're going with the net gigabyte
stick by two four gigabyte sticks
instead go dual channel it will help it
will matter and often times it's five to
ten dollars more for two by four instead
of one by eight if that might even be a
couple bucks cheaper it depends on like
kiddo memory as for the frequency it's
obviously not quite as simple as just
frequency timings matter the most and
more than just the couple like four or
five top level timings sub timings and
AMD boards can get kind of screwy
depending on what board you're using so
there's a lot of play there we can't
test for every scenario but the g.skill
tried and xik it did really well in our
testing it's also pretty expensive
in fact it's it's kind of exiting the
price range of what's reasonable to buy
with an APU if you're spending that much
on memory you almost might as well just
get a d GPU and a cheap CPU so you might
have to dial it back a bit the good news
is even coming down from that expensive
kit of memory there's not a whole lot of
range in the following sort of one to
two kits that we tested the Corsair
29:33 kit that we got a year ago from
AMD for Rison because it was at the time
the only valid aid kit Verizon that kit
did pretty well here it's often roughly
tied with a tried NZ kit it's reasonably
affordable and g.skill has good Ripjaws
kits that are faster than the old 2401
we tested here you pick one of those up
the point is until you really get down
to like 20 426 66 megahertz you're not
losing a ton of performance so if the
difference is significant in price which
it can be especially for countries that
aren't the US where prices we've looked
at them the memory prices are kind of
crazy there too but if the price
difference is a significant between I
don't know 29 33 on 3200 just get 29 30
it's fine you can apply that money
better towards something else because
the minute you're spending an extra
twenty dollars on memory you're really
getting into territory where a low-end
CPU and addy GPU with lower end memory
would be better value for your money but
if you are somewhere I mean the u.s.
sometimes has about the same price
between thirty two hundred and twenty
sixty six if you're in that situation I
don't it's I guess just buy the better
one because it does actually matter a
bit so yeah not not world ending
differences in the two primary use cases
that we tested the LP accent right and Z
but pretty significant differences
between the Triton Z and the Ripjaws
twenty four hundred megahertz kit so
that's where it starts to come into play
and those timings were pretty close so
you are starting to look at a raw
frequency difference to some extent
there and again this isn't the most
comprehensive in the world that you
could do because there's a lot of memory
there a lot of motherboards they all
kind of play a little bit differently
through your own research all that stuff
but hopefully this gives you a starting
point and some basic concepts as to what
really matters with the Raven Ridge ap
