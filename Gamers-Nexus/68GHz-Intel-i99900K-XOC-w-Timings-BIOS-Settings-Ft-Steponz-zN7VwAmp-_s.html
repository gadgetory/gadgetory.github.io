am joined now by is it fair to say an
EXO seer is that fair to say
it's an overclocking celebrity
overclocking celebrity step on Z and
what is what's your what's your dual SLI
score on time spy extreme I don't have
what sorry okay I need to get in on that
okay well technically I'm then more
qualified I guess
oh that's I guess so so step on ZZZ here
he actually you've been at the g.skill
event at Computex you've done a lot of
extreme overclocking we have an
ellentube pot in front of me what is it
what's CPU what's the motherboard that
we're talking about today we have the
asus hero motherboard and that's z 390
and then we also have the intel 9900 k
the new ninth gen processor and so I
guess let's just start with the
frequency and then go from there before
that this video is brought to you by the
NZXT e series power supplies the e
series PS use our high end power
supplies with real time digital voltage
and temperature monitoring per rail
wattage measurements and data logging
functionality for power usage the e
series PSU is also come with a 10 year
warranty all the way down to the 500
watt unit and they run fully modular and
with silent fan operating modes
learn more at the link below what do you
what have you had it running at stable
well the other day I headed up running
about six eight and that's at all eight
cores on the on the chip so it's not
just one core pushing as much frequency
so all eight cores and basically six
eight you know not bad
hey right now since I'm having a lot of
condensation issues I had to switch
boards and kind of get it up and running
so we're running about six gig right now
how do you feel about the the soldered
Tim as opposed to delayed and going that
route it saves me a lot of time to be
honest what I have very big hands so
trying to go and wipe that little
processor and cleaning it up underneath
it's it's actually much better I'm
actually very happy about it
is there thermally I mean how does this
perform versus when you deal it and just
do some kind of paste is there any
noticeable difference for extreme
overclocking oh it's a huge difference
because usually we have to delete it or
deal it and then we have to put the
paste underneath the processor
then when we're actually benching we
have to worry about the paste underneath
and then we have to worried about it on
top so you have two places where it
could fail and now you only have one
favor so one place so it's much much
much better it saves us a lot of time I
mean I only get as much time as I can to
do this so it increases my time which
increases my good mood I guess you could
say right
so for you were at 6/8 the other day the
board your honor
you don't have an XYZ BIOS here - you
know I don't have an it that's one of
the issues why I'm only at 6 gig you
have to set certain voltages to be able
to get the temperature down to minus 196
right now we're basically running about
minus 100 to about 115 so if I had an
ecstacy BIOS I could run minus 196 and
do 6 7 6 8 and is that it's not a cold
bug issue or what is that yeah what will
happen about minus 120 that the system
will just completely stop working and
you won't be able to do anything
so with those extra volt voltage --is
that you change you can actually get it
and then be able to push it much much
colder so so for for the system we have
here I guess do you want to yeah
let's add some more Allen - so for the
score you've got right now you have a
2664 up for all core CPU and Cinebench
r15 and the frequency for that you've
stepped it down as you said you don't
have an x OC bios so you had what 6 q
Hertz
yeah 6 gigahertz on all 8 pretty easy
yeah pretty pretty damn good score and
send a batch for that yeah not too bad
can't complain about that how about a
memory overclocking I mean has it has it
changed at all on this platform this is
e3 90 now so any differences there it's
it's actually it's very similar I expect
to see some more frequencies usually as
the maturity for the process goes so we
usually see higher frequencies so I
expect it to be better on this platform
than the old platform so is that is that
just IMC quality or increasing or
something like that pretty much we'll
see like and also just as the platform
matures you'll start seeing just it says
people get used to it the manufacturers
just build a better product it's just
one of those things it's just like a
process for
right great okay so for overclocking in
general I guess process always the
workflows pretty much the same as always
right so then and solder is the only
major change it sounds like in terms of
what you're doing because you don't have
to deal it anymore well the two more
cores to so we went from six cores to
eight cores alright and the a course is
I mean to run six eight at eight cores
it's pretty beefy I mean back in the day
when you had that like what haswell-e
you're talking you're lucky to get what
I'm getting right now so I can get six
eight that's 800 megahertz difference
that's amazing so it's pretty cool yeah
absolutely
can we we take a look at BIOS to just
see I know so just to go ahead and
reboot it I guess we want to jump into
BIOS or whatever you need to do but just
to sort of give setting just of just to
preface it for the audience this is at
an Intel event and it's pretty pretty
quick and dirty setup right we don't
even have an x OC by us here there's
actually no insulation to so don't try
this at home
right so so don't judge too hard is what
I'm saying yeah I don't have any of the
extra voltages so I basically have to
kind of just use the basic ones I mean
it's it's not too difficult it's just
couple of settings and you're ready to
go and so well we'll take b-roll of this
for editing and after but let's walk
through what you have this is the Asus
bias most of the viewers I've seen this
before I think and for let's let's go
through your settings so for Correggio
you're at 60 all core what else what
else you have set up let's see we have
60 on all cores I I think for this one
just uh the cache is just 50 and then I
was running about one seven volts about
one nine on DRAM we're running about
3600 but we're running tight latency so
CL 1212 V CC IO one to five system agent
one two usually we push these much
higher so around the problem one for
range when we're going at minus 196 have
you have you ever encountered CPU
degradation or IMC degradation from
pushing these too high not really most
of the chips that I see are pretty good
usually we have more issues because of
the actual
I don't know condensation so you see two
here today in the background there's a
lot of condensation those are the things
that usually kill stuff so any other
settings you've changed in here not much
actually just maybe memory if you go
down into the room timing control so you
were running CL 1212 a lot different
than normal desktop user this is a bench
time as we call it so we're running
about 3,600 this is a four dimm board
versus a to dim board so the memories
not going to be able to go as high the
performance is not gonna be as good as a
to dim board because of just the way the
board's laid out is that just a trace
length or trace layout or something
basically so then I saw you had the cash
ratio set to fifty right how how much
does the cash ratio or the let's go back
to a previous page and yeah cash ratio
so how much in your experience does that
impact your scores I mean if you ran
this good actually you have to you have
to have a pretty close to the processor
it's usually good so if you're at like
six gig anywhere between five and 55 I
mean you're never gonna see the cash go
over the processor so well yeah I mean
I've seen so when I was running about
six seven six eight we were probably
about six one on the cache so cool so
well that's the ninety nine hundred K
under ellen's who I guess first one I've
seen and thank you for joining me mr.
Stefan Z hey it was a pleasure
overclocking celebrity I can say I've
met one not
well link one of his I will link like
your you have a youtube channel or
Twitter I stopped doing it actually
okay so we'll link hit one of his scores
below that's what we'll do we'll promote
one of my scores that you're watching
subscribe for more as always we'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
