Nexus dotnet and i'm here with steve our
editor-in-chief to bring you this week's
hardware news so for the first item off
the top here intel has their new broad
valley lineup that was leaked this is
all alleged leaks it's on the website
got the specs table i should know that
this isn't official from intel so things
could change but i'm fairly confident
that it is all accurate the biggest item
here is there are four SKUs for the new
broadwell eline I've normally do three
skews and that will be shipping on LGA
2011 v3 so it's got a new socket the
version 3 of the socket and the big
processor is the 69 50 X which has 10
cores and 20 threads because it's hyper
threaded Linda how do you know how many
court how many courses your system had
right now 88 so we got 10 and 20 threads
on this thing that's coming out on the
69 50x yeah six 900 k is 8 and 16 you
can check the specs table for the rest
of that and that pretty much covers the
Intel stuff we know right now but we'll
stay on top of it as more news emerges
EVGA just announced its $400 GTX 970
hybrid which uses a subtext liquid
cooling to keep GPU temperatures down
and also has a blower fan for vrm
cooling and this comes after the 980 TI
hybrid which is a card that we pretty
strongly recommended for it's
impressively cool performance and I've
got the 970 hybrid on the bench already
is being tested we don't have final
thermal data in yet but I'm seeing about
a 20 Celsius delta T over ambient when
it's under load so that means that if we
add back in ambient which here is 71 f
or 20 ish 21 22 Celsius that puts that
somewhere in the 40 range for under load
performance and that is very impressive
for a GPU under load and that comes at
the 11 40 megahertz base clock it is pre
overclocked to 11 40 megahertz over the
reference 970 design and it boosts to 12
79 megahertz 400 bucks and will be
reviewed on the site and channel shortly
one of the big stories this week for us
was an exclusive where we had
information from ace
about a CMD or cease and desist ordered
against AMD for the r9 fury x and
against gigabyte for their 980 liquid
cooled water force video cards so that's
been out there for a little while now we
received a statement from AMD who more
or less said something to the effect of
not our problem go talk to cooler master
because cooler master is the group that
was originally they originally received
an injunction had an injunction imposed
against them by the judge for a sex
lawsuit coolermaster is convicted of
20-something counts of patent
infringement against the AC tech liquid
cooling setup and now it's tex going
after andy for the r9 theory x which is
sort of a proxy for cooler master cooler
master reached out to us with a
statement as well and i am pushing back
for a bit more clarity on that statement
because it didn't make a whole lot of
sense but we're giving them some room to
breathe because they they're based in
taiwan so going to give a bit of time on
that to get some clarification on what
coolermaster is trying to say with their
ace tech and ECM lawsuit statement and
that pretty much wraps most of the NDA's
tech stuff we have right now will cover
it more through the next week though
they certainly didn't need that but AMD
has had some news this week that did not
involve receiving a cease and desist
they've announced that free sink will
now work over HDMI which will be
interesting for some living room gaming
setups up until now free sync was only
working over display port and the first
quarter of 2016 will see some compatible
displays coming out from LG acer and
samsung corsair snuck in a new case
launched before the end of the year with
the 600 see which you might have already
seen the review on the website but if
not the 600 Â°c and the 600 QR
interesting because the mother board
layout is actually inverted which means
its flipped and rotated so when you
install the motherboard it will be
upside down and on the right side right
it'll be on the wrong side of the case
as it were an early on the left side the
600 see is a highly performant case we
saw it actually has the best GPU clean
performance that we've ever seen in a
case that we've tested it's got pretty
good cpu cooling performance there's
only outperformed by the b-2 spirit
which is mass
of compared to the 600 see so a bit
different market there but this is
Connor c600 Q are both good for GPU cool
in and that is because of their inverted
motherboard layout you can see the
review on the channel already or on the
website gamers Nexus net and as always
if you like this kind of content hit

and help us out thanks for watching and
we'll see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
