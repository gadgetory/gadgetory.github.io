r9 390 s and crossfire versus SLI GTX
970 to try and determine one which is
better than two is it even worth doing
multi card configurations in opposition
to obviously a single more expensive
card like a 980ti
for more depth on that specific aspect
of the argument check out our previous
video 980ti
vs SLI GTX 970 s to see what we thought
about multi card configurations in the
modern era versus a single GPU for
today's test we are using one r9 390
card with two GPUs on it so it's
actually a dual core video card and that
is the power color devil 13 r9 390 dual
GPU card it is massive quite obviously
you can tell from the side profile view
of it here it's got 32 power headers
which is actually about what most dual
card setups will take if you're using
two independent cards it just looks a
lot more impressive on one and it's also
got a huge heatsink that's very loud but
we don't do noise testing so that is one
thing that I will not be objectively
looking at today I can subjectively tell
you right now that this card is much
louder than any other video card I've
ever tested especially at load and as
far as the tests we are running today
for objective measurements we're looking
at the power consumption of at 970 s and
s live versus r9 390 s in crossfire and
we're also looking at the framerate
performance and temperature or thermal
performance as always you can check the
website for test methodology the testing
systems used and all the charts not
shown here hit the link in the
description below for more information
on that or just go to gamers nexus
dotnet today we're starting with the
power draw
so the pcs duel card GPU or dual GPU
card draws 580 2.73 watts at full system
load that is the full system power
consumption the r9 390 measured at 341
Watts previously with just 1 r9 390 and
the sli GTX 970 sr at 400 11.7 2 watts
so the 970 is quite obviously are
significantly lower power consumption
for peak system load with the crossfire
sli battle here head-to-head that is 170
Watts difference between the two can
figurations and that is actually
noticeable enough to change what kind of
power supply you're buying but let's
look at how that impacts thermals and
then performance thermals are average
between both these cards but the dual
card the PCs devil 13 is very loud and
we test on an open bench but if you had
in a case it would still be pretty loud
the thermals delta T over ambient are
fifty four point four three Celsius for
the sli nine 70s that's GPU number one
and 53.6 two Celsius for the 390 GPU
diode number one so the sli 970 first
GPU is actually a bit warmer marginally
one degree than what we're looking at
here for the devil thirteen now this is
obviously massively impacted by the
cooler use by the manufacturer the AIB
but the 390 is running cooler just
frankly because it's pushing so much air
so fast that's what produces the noise
but keeps the temperatures manageable as
for gaming performance we're only going
to focus on a few charts here but
there's a table at the end of this video
discussion in the video that shows a
head-to-head comparison who won which
round and by what percentage they won so
that is a new thing we're doing that I
hope will help you figure out at a
glance what's the best option for you
getting started with fps
Metro last light at 1080p saw the 970 s
in sli winning out over the crossfire
390 s 116 fps against 115 fps that is a
0.87 percent Delta and that is just
barely outside of our margin of test
error so the difference is unnoticeable
entirely and the 980ti for reference
runs at 122 fps a slight bit more than
either of these two configurations and
costed about the same as the 970 s in
SLI the devil 13 since I didn't already
mention it is priced at $500 after a
rebate it's $100 rebate but $600
normally so depending on whether or not
you count that rebate you're looking at
a fairly even head-to-head in terms of
price between these configurations but
if you do count the rebate $500 puts it
at the cost of a single 980 and
significantly under the cost of 9 ATI or
2 970 s slightly over the cost of 390x
at 4
20 dollars getting back into things here
Metro last light at 1440p the nine 70s
in sli again better than three 90s in
crossfire that is 89 verse 88 FPS or 1.1
3% Delta again effectively unnoticeable
to any user and the 980 I about the same
89 FPS at 4k the crossfire 3 90s pull
ahead which makes for some interesting
data even over the 980ti and that's 58
fps verse 56 FPS on the 970 s and 58 FPS
again 3 90's against 50 7.3 FPS on the
980 iso they're all right they're next
to each other fallout 4 is a quick one
at 1080p the 970 is an SLI are superior
to the 390 s in crossfire by a massive
amount 36.5% that is actually very
noticeable in gameplay that's 81 fps vs.
56 fps and that's obviously in our
specific test course your mileage may
vary depending where you test there's no
crossfire scaling right now and fallout
4 as far as we can tell I haven't tested
thoroughly on all of the cards but
definitively on to 390 s in this
instance at least with a devil 13 we saw
no crossfire scaling and that means that
your money is effectively wasted if you
do have a second physical GPU or a dual
GPU card
shadow of Mordor at 1080p shows the
first 1080 victory thus far for the
crossfire 3 90s over the sli 970 that's
one 30 FPS versus one 24 FPS again
effectively unnoticeable to the user but
worth showing that's a 4.7 percent Delta
there is a massive 0.1% FPS dip to the
tune of 51 FPS versus the average for
the three 90s and that is definitely
something worth note the 980 eye is at
122 FPS just for sort of a benchmark of
where things fall at 1440p the crossfire
390 is retain their lead 100 FPS 4 is 96
or 4.1 percent that's pretty linear
terrible 0.1% lows however on the
crossfire 3 90s at 32 versus 45 for the
SLI 970 so that is something that AMD
has historically struggled with is the
frame times or 0.1 percent lows and
that show is here at 4k again 390 s in
the lead this time by 8% which measures
up with our previous test where we saw
an advantage as resolution increases
that is 61 verse 56 point 3 FPS not
super noticeable but that is starting to
enter the range of a player potentially
actually noticing it at least for anyone
who's hyper focused on that 60 FPS
metric Just Cause 3 has no reasonable
scaling for crossfire or SLI and is a
complete waste for this game so if you
have multi card configurations from
either vendor in Just Cause 3 you're not
going to see gains that are worthwhile
in the least black ops 3 is actually one
of the most interesting benchmarks we
have for you today other than fallout
and that is because at 1440p the
crossfire 3 90s produce a 154 FPS versus
the 139 FPS of sli 970 s now you could
drop settings just slightly for the sli
970 s and managed to produce a 144 FPS
but we're getting it with pretty much
everything maxed out with the crossfire
390 s the only reason I say that this
10-point to 4% Delta is noteworthy here
is because black ops is a type of game
where people with 144 Hertz displays
will actually want to push for that
extra couple FPS to satisfy the 144
Hertz throughput potential as far as
Assassin's Creed syndicate this one is
also problematic but we had crashing
issues that we could not resolve the
game would crash within about a minute
of getting into the game with the
crossfire 390 s it worked fine with SLI
970 s not particularly impressive but
fine ran but with the three 90s we were
able to execute exactly one task before
it crashed and that shows the three 90s
in crossfire slightly behind the 970
however I would discard this data or
disregard it anyway just because it's
it's it's really not too representative
of a real scenario since you can't even
play the game in our current test and
finally here's a chart showing the
head-to-head matchup of all the data I
just went through and some additional
data GTA 5 and others included so
hopefully that will give you an idea
there are notes here as well I've gone
through most of those in the last minute
or so talking but you can find it all in
the
scription below where the website is
linked check that out so then is it
worth getting crossfire 390s or GTX 970
s in SLI generally the 970 s in SLI
perform a bit better than the crossfire
390s and when they do perform better it
is by a lot and that's because the game
or drivers don't support the crossfire
setup properly especially the case with
Just Cause 3 and fallout 4 where you see
the 36% gap between this and 2 9 70s and
that gap is because of the lack of
crossfire scaling so when the s are
better they are a lot better when the
crossfire setups are better they are
kind of better by a couple percent three
four or five percent on average but the
biggest gaps we saw were about 10% would
I buy either of these setups I'm going
to tell you right now no I would
personally buy a single card whether
that's a 980ti or a fury ax kind of
depends on what you're trying to do
specifically what your use case is do
you have a radiator slot all that stuff
I won't go into that argument here but I
would buy one of those two cards instead
of either multi-gpu setup and that is
largely for reasons I discussed pretty
heavily in the 970 SLI versus the 90 ati
video where we see sort of the same day
1 launch support is a little
questionable at times it takes a bit
longer for SLI or crossfire to get full
adequate support for games out the gate
and then of course your disabling one
card sometimes when there's problems or
there's always some kind of micro
stutter in some kind of game it seems
like with these setups and microsites
infuriating enough again to disable a
card this card anyway is not a bad buy
but there's potentially better value now
that said it's currently $500 after a
rebate and that's a pretty big price gap
considering your performance is about
matched with the 970 so if you are
strictly looking at 2 970 s versus 2
390s meaning you're not considering the
possibility of a 980 TI for some reason
maybe price then in that case this is
actually currently with $100 rebate a
better value but it does depend a bit on
my games you're playing because you're
playing Fallout 4 exclusively then what
I just said is irrelevant frankly
because crossfire scaling at least with
this setup is basically non-existent on
fallout 4 and Assassin's Creed syndicate
hardly even worked so it does depend a
bit on which game you're playing whether
this is better than SLI 970 s or not to
a noticeable level and because of the
degree the way that it depends on game
the game performance support stuff like
that that is why I generally recommend
the single card because you are
basically guaranteed that the game will
work and if it doesn't work then you can
bet that it's probably not working on
basically any single card configuration
at least from that manufacturer and
that's a bit more reliable than
multi-gpu setups so that has remained
true for a long time however the one
argument we haven't discussed here is
power and thermals the thermals don't
worry about them because the temperature
was about the same for the sli 970 s and
this card but the devil 13 was very loud
so it depends on which three 90s setup
you get if you just buy two independent
three 90s either from power color or
sapphire or anyone else it will be
quieter than this thing here the next
thing with regard to power the power
draw for the two three nine you set up
was 580 is something watts for the peak
system load and for the sli nine 70s it
was 411 or something like that so 180
170 watt difference is big enough that
it changes what power supply you're
getting actually by a good amount
there's a good margin there you need to
increase your power supplies they need
to spend more money on it so that is an
argument also worth looking at depending
on what you're trying to build for your
system if you already have a power
supply stuff like that so that is the
