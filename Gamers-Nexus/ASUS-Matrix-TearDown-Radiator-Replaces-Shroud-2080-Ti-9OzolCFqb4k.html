getting used to that and we are taking
apart the Asus 2080 TI matrix this card
is extremely interesting even if you
don't think you want a 2080 ti you
should still look at it because they've
integrated a radiator into the shroud
and and we have some b-roll footage of
that to show you what it looks like but
we're gonna take it apart and get a
closer look because they do some
interesting things here it's a unique
design it's technically a liquid-cooled
card it's just that all of the liquid
cooling is compacted into one board and
it's not hugely oversized compared to
the other 28 ET is so we want to see how
all that works in today's video before
that this video is brought to you by the
gigabyte r-tx 2070 gaming OC now
available in a matte white model to
match the emergence of white PC cases
the r-tx 2070 gaming OC is a three fan
cooling solution and four composite heat
pipes on Nvidia's newest Orion GPU and
ships with a pre overclock of 1740
megahertz in OC mode or 1725 in gaming
mode RGB fusion is also available for
the LED enthusiast learn more at the
link in the description below let's do a
quick walkthrough of the card so first
of all it has the same fans as the Strix
the ROG Strix 20 atti
we already talked about how these change
from the previous generation it also has
the same PCB as the ROG Strix 2080 Ti so
that's the same - you might remember
when we showed the 28 ET I originally
ended a teardown on that the Strix we
talked out some in doctors that were
angled differently than all the others
and how that was for a future project
that we weren't privy to at the time but
we now know what it was for and it was
for this and we have well you'll see in
a moment but the cold plate on this is
pretty uniquely shaped it's just it's
wider than all the it's got a bigger
diameter than all the others that you
typically see on cards and so even
though this is water cooled in a GPU
with everything compacted into one
shroud they have done some pretty unique
things to take care of thermals so this
is jet if it's just like the stretch
which I think it is it's four screws to
loosen the entire cooling assembly which
is actually really nice because there's
a
sort of a substructure under the shroud
and on top of the base or it is the base
plate that is the structural support for
everything so only needs four screws not
all of these spots here this is always
an indication of a screw coming through
normally through the base plate through
the PCB and then securing the backplate
to the card so that's what those are for
we might not get through those today
we're at CES and if your echo that's
also why there's echo LED switch there
nothing special so here's here's the
whole thing it's a it's a bit wide shot
but let's walk through it from right to
left camera right so we've got here the
cold plate this we've got a b-roll shot
as well we'll throw it in somewhere in
this video showing the typical sized
cold plate the one that asus has here I
am 99% certain is the EVGA hybrid CLC
cold plate which is an ace attack Gen
4.5 cold plate which you can tell
because it's got the the extended base
coming out of the bottom of it that's
typical of EVGA s four point five
tentacle plate so this one's a bit wider
it's not a Sutekh we don't know a
hundred percent sure no suppliers yet
today of the pomp or anything like that
it could be pumped like this it could be
Dino Tron or a politic or someone along
those lines we'll try and find out later
when we can take the palm apart so
that's the cold plate it is large and
the reason it's large is because we pan
back over to the PCB
you will see that the we come back to
these inductors I mentioned so when we
we saw the Strix originally I said that
these were rotated for a future project
they didn't tell us about and this is
the future project so that wide diameter
cold plate extends of course because
it's a circle into the center of the
inductor line that's why it's rotated
the reason it extends is to get full
coverage of the vram so the memory
modules are covered here and then the
vrm it's the Strix BRM it was kind of an
overkill vrm to start with so that's
good because it helps with with thermal
dissipation across a wide surface area
but then they've got this base plate on
top of it and this will just be cooled
by air so it's air coming through a
radiator it's going to be hot air in
theory it should still be cooler than
not blowing air onto it it'll test all
that later but the air coming through
the radiator will be hitting these the
spin stack and that cools the MOSFETs
and dr. line there doesn't need any
cooling really and
that covers most of those components as
for the interface to the the memory
you'll notice that there's nothing on
that Coldplay right now this is a a
pre-production model so it's not done
some stuff on here might change it's
pretty much done but one example of
something that we don't know the finals
on yet would be how the memory is going
to sink into the cold plate so let's
either paste or pad or something along
those lines and you throw all putty but
one of those three things and then let's
see what else we can look at here on the
the rest of it's all pretty familiar so
I mean the right side we still have the
fan hookups which I'll try and get a
shot of that so two for pin fan headers
in there there's it looks like an RGB
header in there 12 volt and then GRB
would be the pin out on that within a
cable for probably the pomp or the fans
on the shroud and then there's another
cable that we've already disconnected on
this side of the cooler on the right
side that actually this is the one for
the pump right there there's your power
and ground and again this is a non-final
design
so that's your hookup for the pump the
pump is right here so that is integrated
in the shroud and it looks like the
tubing is the name of the exact tubing
escapes me right now but it looks like
the kind that has the teflon and our
liner on it which helps with permeation
this stuff you don't really want to use
it in like in a closed loop that you
have on a CPU where the user is bending
it because it is a bit more fragile to
being bent but if it's pre-installed by
the manufacturer it's a bit better use
and that's what's happening here because
they're gonna route it obviously in a
way that it won't crack the teflon and
so you end up with a teflon liner that
should help with permeation that I don't
have exact detail on that but just based
on experience I'm pretty sure that's
what that is for the tube type so that's
going into the the looks like cold plate
and the housing directly so there's we
have the top side of this cold plate
with all the micro fins in a separate
shot we're not gonna pull it out of here
and drain all the fluid out of ACE use
this demo card so we'll show a separate
shot of that with the micro fins but it
is a wider surface area micro thin
contact and typical which is good that's
what you want to see for a wider service
area
last thing here for the radiator so it
it comes all the way across it looks
like it's about a 240 millimeter
radiator but the tank so typically you
have the fat tank on the end of the
radiator where there's just some tiny
bit of extra water storage
that's me located centrally on this card
closer to the cold plate but it does
look like about a 240 so that covers the
matrix 20 atti pricing TBD but you I
mean you've seen what the card looks
like so it will be high or than the
other 20 ATT eyes it's a pretty unique
design very interesting we're looking
forward to testing it but that's it for
this one so thank you for watching
