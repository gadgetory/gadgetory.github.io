sapphire rx 460 nitro we did this third
Platinum Edition card showed that it
wasn't a great design but this one's
much different so instead of using the
reference our X 480 cooler this one has
its own custom cooler from their nitro
series it's a dual push fan setup and
the fans are actually removable which we
show on the review of the card for
warranty reasons but we're gonna take it
apart a quick overview of the card
there's basically just a totally useless
piece of the PCB here that has served
only for aesthetic purposes so it's got
their nitro with that I don't really
know what way that's supposed to be
oriented with the Cobra GI Joe logo on
it then there's a couple LEDs on here
they do not diffuse across the service
put some LEDs a six pin and a cooler so
we're just where you take it apart - it
looks like I don't think I'm gonna do a
hybrid model on this one I know some
people have requested it but we've got
some travel coming up so there may not
be time for something quite like that
but we will we'll see that really isn't
a demand for a hybrid mode on this card
because it already is performing within
a decent spec the thermals are are
fairly flat not impressive but not bad
so the shroud is this these are not
holes I don't know how I look camera
picks it up those are not holes it's
just a design shroud fan two screws
holding the fan into place actually we
can show this this is kind of neat so
this is cool because it's fairly well
designed instead of doing kind of a fan
cable like like this thing here
obviously a normal fan cable I connects
to the board that's a four pin or you
can even see these in here these kind of
four pin cables which do actually power
the fans the fans themselves are
connected with the
set of contacts and so when the when you
remove it for warranty you don't have to
mess with any cables which reduces the
risk of someone who might not know what
they're doing
damaging or not plugging in the fans or
whatever when they're done it's pretty
obvious the way it goes together pins
contact contacts and that's all there is
to it so we've got the fan and then the
shroud is very simply one cable here
connecting to the card that controls
both fans you can see that the cable
splits to two others and there's talk to
the fans directly on this is a little
piece of foam this is not a thermal
thing this is almost definitely a sound
absorption thing or well not really
absorption as much as just damping so
there's no vibration so that'll stop any
unreasonable vibration from the the fans
against the aluminum heatsink causing
any issues the heatsink very standard
set up so it's an aluminum heatsink you
can see just widely spaced aluminum fins
there is there are two heat pipes so you
can see the start at the end of the heat
pipe here starting the end of the heat
pipe here I crimped at the top as always
and those contact those go through the
aluminum heatsink then there's a giant
block of what looks like maybe nickel
plated copper right here and we'll see
that when we pull it apart and that is
covering minimally the GPU but it looks
like it's also covering the vram so
let's pull that apart okay very easy so
here's what we've got this is a four
gigabyte card
unlike the 470 where we saw eight 512
megabyte chips or four gigabit this one
has four chips 4 V Ram modules these are
cheap thermal adhesive
of bits you can see right here is the
one for the other module that's missing
super tiny copper block and that's
because if you look at the GPU proper
this is the smallest one we've looked at
yet so this is Polaris 11 let's let's
clean this off and see what it looks
like all right very tiny piece of
silicon there in the middle and then the
substrate normal capacitors lining it on
the outside so as usual just shrunken
and Polaris 11 is a low-power little
performance chip this is a two point
something terrible option two points you
somewhere around there
I was interesting to you I didn't even
notice this as a cost-saving measure
sapphire hasn't even populated all of
the pins on the PCIe which I did not
notice before taking it apart even
though obviously this is shown i
realistically this things on a high
performance card anyway so it's not
going to be a 1080 doesn't use all the
bandwidth of x16 so a 460 certainly
won't but still half these pins are
normally ground basically so they've cut
those out so that's a cost-saving
measure so if the vrm we've got a one
two three four looks like five phase
setup and or a four plus 1/4 plus one so
you've got a four plus one phase design
power design these are the inductors
your capacitor bank and then this piece
of metal right here is covering the
MOSFETs I remove that oh there okay so
another thermal sticky tape covering the
MOSFETs so there's our MOSFETs pastured
capacitor inductor chokes whatever you
want to call it and that's our vrm setup
the six pin power over here on the right
side of the board rather than the top 4
v RL or v ram chips or modules rather so
that's really it there's not a lot
to this board for LEDs right here you
can see there's a blank fan header up
here that they haven't filled because
why would they they have one fan header
feeding into it that's powering both
fans so there's really no reason to put
another one there because they're not
talking to the board with the fans
directly anyway it's all done through a
pass through travel pastures the chip
that's it
so that is an RX 460 as I said don't
expect the hybrid model this but
hopefully some other cool hybrid mods
come in to him that makes a bit more
sense with regard to thermals no for
clocking and something like this card as
always you can check our full review of
the RX 4 60's are already on the channel
should be live at least a day before

you all next time
