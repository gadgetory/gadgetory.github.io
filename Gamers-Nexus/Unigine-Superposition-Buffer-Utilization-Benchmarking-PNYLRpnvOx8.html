PAX East 2017 am NOT looking at an EVGA
product actually we were looking at a
new unit end product if you're familiar
with bench working at all in the past
you have probably seen image in heaven
this is a new software tool from Unigine
called superposition and actually from a
benchmarking standpoint which is sort of
what we do is a really cool thing so
I'll show you why the main reason this
is just your normal rendering a really
complex scene you get your graphics
framerate output graphics frequency all
that stuff GPU frequency but the cool
thing is we can push f3 and see all the
buffers so this is what I'm excited
about because I'm really curious to know
more about these types of numbers we
never get this level of access with
games unless we get some kind of debug
mode and it's exceptionally rare that
developers give that to us
so with this which is of course a one
it's just a one scenario we can look at
with this we're seeing things like
render texture for example this texture
in particular 1080 texture 4 megabytes
is what it's taking we can also see
things like this texture 256 K or 1 by
256 pixels I should say would be poor
correct it takes 256 bytes and then more
interesting stuff albedo have you've
seen albedo albedo before we talked
about it with Crytek at GDC last year I
believe and that is to do with
physically based rendering we have a
whole video talking about that in here
also SSAO 960 by 480 taking up 506 K so
pretty cool to see exactly how much be
Ram the different or cache or whatever
may be but B Ram in this case the
different aspects of graphics will
consume for a different example
somewhere in here I don't see it off
just right now but somewhere in here
there is a reprojection frame and so
that is for VR this has a be our
benchmark built into it I'm not exactly
sure how it works yet but we can see the
size in the buffer
reprojection frame is consuming so from
most of the frames I've seen in here it
tends to be about 10 megabytes and a
reprojected frame is sort of like when
you have a stutter except that's
updating your head tracking in VR so
that takes up some space of course
linear depth opacity depth all these
different buffers normal Maps reflection
refraction render textures again
exposure depth of field all that stuff's
in there really cool I'm hoping to dig
into it more in the future we'll be
talking to unit genic now that's for
sure other things we got this is the
scene it has some physics crunching
going on back here all of these objects
are flying off because you can actually
modulate the gravity setting live in the
benchmark and I'll show that in a moment
we've also got the frequency of the GPU
frequency of the memory temperature of
the GPU and this is just the gtx 1080 of
some kind lights that are currently
being rendered if that's pretty cool -
and lighting has a huge impact on
performance in this benchmark we can
control that manually as well surfaces
being rendered with maps or materials
mats being rendered and then we've got
these controls down here which I've just
hit the monitor control but if we hit f4
we can now take control of the camera
it's not not the best frame rate right
now to have 30fps but I'm going to walk
over here and at this this object we
have some controls so this control is
for the physics processing and if we
turn this way you'll see we've got some
stuff flapping around but if I change
that everything's flying and now the
framerate is tanking as well so we just
went from something like 40 to 50 to 30
to 40 we can turn that down
one of these controls of lights I'm not
sure which one that controls light to
some extent and then let's get this last
one in here before I sign off by the way
you can see the depth of field like
crazy in this benchmark but here's the
lighting control has some impact on fps
and we can configure the benchmark to be
a bit more unique so really cool stuff
I'm excited to see this because
benchmarking tools are great
we just automated about half of our
synthetic benchmarks I hope this has
command line prompts because I would
love to have some command line arguments
to automate this as well we'll have more
on this in the future thank you for
watching and go to
patreon.com/crashcourse next helps that
directly gamers exit on that for more
information subscribe for more I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
