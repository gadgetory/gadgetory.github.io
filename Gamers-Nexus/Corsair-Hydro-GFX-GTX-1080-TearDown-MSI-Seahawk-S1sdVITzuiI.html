Coursera hydrographics aka MSI Seahawk
card it is the same card with a
different name MSI provided the board
and courser provide the cooling solution
the GPU is the GTX 1080 so we be tearing
this down a review is forthcoming either
it's already out at the time of this
video going up or will be out within
hours so subscribe for that before
getting to the teardown this content is
brought to you by IO power and their new
elements gaming PC which has fans that I
am told are called arsc fans but I'm
sticking it with ARC because it's a way
cooler name so it's got arc fans and LED
under glow and that is the sponsor this
is the video card so we're gonna take
this apart as I said the full review
thermals fps with mostly thermals that's
really interesting all that will be in
another video today we're gonna take it
apart and see what it actually looks
like underneath so EVGA has got a
counter to this card called the hybrid
not the one that we build but an actual
proper EVGA hybrid we will be looking at
that very shortly as well in the
meantime this is the uncontested
official liquid cooled solution that we
will be looking at you can see backplate
is mounted by a couple screws here we've
got four screws including the warranty
voiding one for the the cold plate and
the pump so this goes to the pump this
cooler is an H 55 cooler we'll see when
I take it apart what it looks like but
as I understand it this is the same
cooler as you'd find for a CPU including
the slight curvature in the cold plate
however I know that coarser was looking
into that last time well of course and I
was I last time we looked at a Seahawk
card so we'll see if that remains the
case here it may be a flat flat cooler
now which would certainly be better for
cooling GPUs
cheap backplate doesn't do a whole lot
but it's got the logo on there so that's
a backplate very easy to remove we are
done with that these screws I'll go to
the backplate my magnetic mat is in use
with another card right now so just
Pilar is there and remember it hopefully
this I will take off last let's get the
shroud off of this thing looks pretty
easy so three screws one two three right
there and then not on the front and
three in the top and then we have some
one the expansion panel as well on the
back of the card so let's start with
these so the really interesting thing
that we want to show here is what
cooling Hardware does this use
underneath because we're going to be
comparing this in just a few days to the
EVGA hybrid which is probably one of the
flagship liquid cooled cards that will
be coming out this generation because
they held pretty much the only spot in
the market for it with the 980 series
the 980 TI
all right cool so of course our branded
shroud comes off can this come off yet
there's a screw in the underside
somewhere the screw on the underside
okay so that's the expansion plate this
has a fan or an LED connected to it
somewhere it is there's an LED of some
kind in there
okay that's disconnected and then feels
like there's a fan over here maybe
obviously but the cable the hell is
stuck all right cool
broke something okay all right there we
go
Sarah's taped that's always so they
where is it right there
he is like you know a canvas type tape
to hold the cable as you can see right
there so that's I had snap that but
there's your shroud as expected it is a
plastic shroud nothing special here
under side it is the same as we've seen
since the 980 980ti you got the curve
here that outfits the fans that goes
right here this is largely for looks
this will not perform a whole lot of
actual function because obviously no air
can go in there and get through this
anyway and also that solid so shroud
their guides their flow around this
channel and over the card not doing a
whole lot because there's no aluminum
heatsink here as normally so normally it
pushes air through a heatsink it cools
the GPU in this instance this fan now
becomes a vrm and a VRAM fan so the base
plate here aluminum base plate is
conducting all the heat through thermal
pads from the MOSFETs on the vram and
then this fan is pushing the heat out of
the back Rast is conducted straight
through the cold plate through the micro
fins the tubes radiator so forth so
that's the inside let's look at the
underside now we can see that this by
the way
splitter that's the vrm fan right there
that's the pump power and they both plug
into the PRM fan header on the stock MSI
board which is the board for the cheaper
blower fan GTX 1080
that has been adapted to mount both of
these devices so let's just disassemble
the rest of this like there's any
evidence that we weight doesn't say
removed yes the warranty is only void if
it's removed has won the previous cards
we worked on we are not removing it so
good work around there except all of its
on camera anyway so also this is a
loaner card that was healthy okay so
here's the interesting bit cold plate is
flat I'll clean that off in a moment you
can see it's got the same circular
thermal paste pattern applied to it from
the factories every other liquid cooler
that's out there for CPUs and otherwise
there's a flat plate it doesn't have the
copper protrusion that we see in the
EVGA hybrid which in the past has
impacted thermals in a positive way so
we'll see how the hybrid from EVGA
stacks against this card especially
because EVGA is using an axial fan here
instead of a radial fan so EVGA is going
with a hundred millimeter circle push
fan rather than this small thing so that
will be very interesting thermally to
look at but we don't have one yet so
today we're just looking at this card
flat plate 855 plate it looks like it
does not have any curvature in it just
by eyeballing it so I'm not sure if
they've modified the cold plate to be a
flat plate but if they have that's a
good thing because GPUs are flat let's
let's clean off this GPU though and look
at the rest of it but we've all seen
this one by now
so it's GPU 104 - 400 of course that is
the 1080 and obviously in a rev so it's
a 1 so there's your GPU that does
doesn't in fact prove that it's 1080 at
the performance didn't already which
again will be in our review
coming up very shortly they're not
already on the channel and certainly not
the cleanest I could get the cold plate
but you get the idea
so there's your flat basically perfectly
flat copper plate that's what you want
you want a flat plate for a flat GPU for
the silicon it's different from a CPU
where the service there's an IHS on the
surface and so there's a natural
curvature of that IHS which is a factor
for CPU core so I'd be just straight
apply a CPU cooler to GPU it's not gonna
work as well as a flat cooler would do
which it looks like coursers taken into
account here this time okay cool so
those cables you never pull by the
actual cable but I did for a little bit
okay so here's the rest of it very
simple we've got a plate metal plate
conducting to the plate directly is the
thermal pad so you've got the where we
here MOSFETs over here so we flip it
this way that's how it goes so you can
see this aligns with the MOSFETs MOSFETs
capacitor banks over here as well
chokes and doctors those don't need to
be actively cooled that's why they stick
out here well they should they are
actively cooled by the fan in fact but
they're not cooled by the base plate
directly because there's no they can hit
like 120 plus Celsius and be mostly fine
and they're naturally going to dissipate
the heat anyway because they're just
large coils so inductors go there
MOSFETs capacitors things like that vram
right here you've got one two three four
five six seven eight to be around
modules that means there are eight
gigabit modules so one gigabyte each so
we've got eight gigabytes of vram as you
would with a gtx 1080 it is gddr5 x that
cools these two that cools the top that
cools those that's pretty much it the
let's look at this and see if there's
any obvious signs of other consumer
obviously missing a doctor here there's
some missing MOSFETs things
that so there's places on the board
where they've down costed or something
to remove them and where is if there's
any extra bio spots or anything I mean
as we've seen previously there's solder
points here for another set of pins if
you wanted it as a manufacturer to face
out this side instead of the top so
that's still there just like the
founders edition card which this is very
similar to so that's the that's the
Seahawk slash hydrographics teardown
anyway we've got one two three four five
phases plus one for memory this is in
fact a founders Edition reference board
that MSI has modified with with the coin
solution in accompaniment with Corsair
so a messiaen course are built a cooling
solution that's this we built our own
hybrid card using an EVGA version of
this and our own DIY spirit I suppose so
you can see that previously if you
search the channel or hit the
description below for the article and
the 1080 hybrid build we did we did in
the review of this card I will be
testing this before was disassembled
this heatsink versus our own hybrid to
see what kind of performance at Delta we
get with an official solution versus our
solution and as I said the EVGA FTW
hybrid is coming up shortly I'm very
curious to see if it outperforms this
because so far it looks like it will be
very close so the previous generation
the MSI 980ti Seahawk was fairly distant
in performance from the 980ti hybrid
from EVGA and a lot of that was the
cooling solution and another factors
that we talked about in that review this
time it's gonna be closer so stay tuned
for that subscribe for more content
patreon link in the postal video if I
could pronounce things would be great
hit that if you wanna help us directly
links in the description below as always
I'll see you all next time
