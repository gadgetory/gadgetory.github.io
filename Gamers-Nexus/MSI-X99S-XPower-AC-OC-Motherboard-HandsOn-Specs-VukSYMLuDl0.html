next instant net and we were here at msi
booth at PAX Prime 2014 this is day two
it's going pretty well so far check the
links in the description below for all
the video content we've already covered
in towns x99 launch cover the new
thousand-dollar cpu pretty crazy stuff
now we have a motherboard this is the X
power board it is by msi they have two
other boards here I don't have that many
hands so we're just trying to the X
power board right now this actually is a
5pc iee setup it has 1 x16 slot and 4x
eight slots so that is a lot of pcie it
is capable of 4-way SLI as I am told
they are not doing any packs
multiplexing because it's not necessary
because the new x99 chips and chipset
are capable of supporting 40 pcie lanes
that is a lot of pcie lanes so you can
set up a PCIe esata SS card pcie ssds if
you would like to there's also an M
state of port on here and that operates
I am told at 32 gigabits per second
which is pretty pretty fast that is a
turbo msata port other than that there's
the normal SATA Express and say 26
gigabits per second port State Express
of course is 10 gigabits per second and
this is a 2011 socket is LGA 2011
because it's fitting the new 59 60 X cpu
which is at eight core thousand-dollar
intel cpu for extreme users for
enthusiasts and for video rendering
drakes things like that this has eight
slots for ram it is capable of course
supporting ddr4 ram that is new with x
99 and then we have some massive heat
sinks here for the vrm and overclocking
cooling solution I am counting one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
looks like maybe 12 days 12 days for
overclocking which is pretty impressive
in terms of the chokes on the board
discussing by that there's normal a
normal o see Jeanie button on here
there's the power and reset button
there's a CMOS reset if you don't like
your overclock and then there are plus
and minus
buttons for changing the clock frequency
of the CPU and I think maybe the voltage
and then of course there's a seven
segment display for errors so that is
the X power board there are two more
boards and we'll cover those in the
article link in the description below if
you see an S at the end of an msi board
that means say to express so if it's x
99 s that means it supports SATA Express
that's the new terminology so check the
link in the description below for more
information and i will see you all next
time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
