TI gaming X and we're immediately back
with an even larger counterpart the
gigabyte 1080 TI or as extreme a multi
expansion slot card with a three fan
cooler way over built heatsink and 12
phase vrm using fairchild at 6 8 to 3 C
50 amp power stages for a total possible
throughput of 600 apps on the GPU core
this makes gigabytes extreme a
heavyweight in all departments and
brings it to our bench for full review
today before getting to that this video
is brought to you by the current bundle
on the GTX 1060 and VT X 1080 video
cards where you can get Ghost Recon
wildlands or for honor at checkout this
comes alongside new MSRP is for the GTX
10 80 series cards now down to $500 you
can learn more at the link in the
description below today's review will
focus mostly on thermals for the extreme
card and it's for a good reason 1
they've got some really interesting
stuff going on with the backside here
and also as seen in our teardown the
cooler is pretty beefed up so be looking
at that very heavily noise testing will
be included in the article link in the
description below if you care about
noise levels the gaming X for what it's
worth outputs a noise level that is
equivalent to all the other twin fros or
10 series cards we've reviewed at least
in the 1080 line like the 1080 game in X
10 somebody came in X as well so I've
got those noise levels there this will
be added that's in the article below
other than that what we're looking at
for the gigabytes extreme card this one
is a 1632 megahertz OC mode clock and
that's kind of out of the box type of
thing you can use their salt or to
switch between OC and gaming modes or a
16:07 megahertz base for the gaming mode
if you go to the boost clocks at 1746 OC
mode and 1721 gaming mode which puts
this technically a little bit ahead of
where the gaming X is but there's a
power limit difference out of the box so
that means that there could be some
slight disparity and performance numbers
until you equalize them with
overclocking or at least boosting the
power target and leaving the clock alone
because boost 3.0 ultimately has a per a
Siq and per power limit type of
functionality when you've accounted for
thermals which both of these car
should be doing speaking of thermals
this Auris card as again shown in our
teardown has a three fan cooler with the
center fan having half of its blades cut
off to accommodate the third fan without
having to expand the card so that's an
interesting point the other items of
interest would be these massive heat
pipes so we've got five heat pipes on
the right side of the card covering the
vrm component and then a couple heat
pipes on the left side covering the GPU
now interestingly the GPU is cooled with
a single cold plate that also contacts
the vram which generally means your GPU
diode reading will be higher than if you
were cooling the vram separately by a
different base plate because you're
sinking all that heat into one area and
cooling it with the same solution the
back side has a copper insert that we'll
be talking about separately and that is
sort of embedded within the backplate
but it can be removed other than that
you've got our GV LEDs everywhere on the
card as one might expect at this point
and just to get this out of the way it
is a $750 card as is the MSI gaming X so
starting with thermal this is the most
interesting part of this benchmark
because ultimately that's what
differentiates these things for the most
part thermal testing we have the full
methodology defined in the article below
as always that includes the
thermocouples that we place on the FET
and on the backside of the PCB these
thermocouples as stated before are about
a hundredth of an inch thick and they
are designed in a way that means that
the adhesive pad doesn't really
interfere with the thermal transfer
ability of the the native cooling
solution on the card so that would be
from the FET to whatever is above it
normally a thermal pad contacting some
kind of plate or thin stack these don't
really interfere with it we're looking
at deltas anyway and they're used to
measure the temperatures of the
components whereas the GPU is measured
with normal diode starting the
temperature testing with something
easier and then getting into the a/b
test with the copper plate on and off on
the back side the first test plots the
temperature of critical board components
against the MSI GTX 1080p eye gaming X
that we just reviewed for those who
missed that review the MSI card had a
very similar FET and PC
backside temperature to the founders
edition card so this can kind of serve
as something of a stand-in for those
numbers since they're so close it'll
also simplify the charge so if you want
to see the EPI card numbers you can
check the EPI review and the gaming
extra view the FE card naturally it has
a much higher GPU temperature of about
84 C when under Otto conditions on both
of these cards help account for that
with these two cards the gigabyte
extreme GP diode temperature runs about
70 to 72 C with the MSI gaming X diode
temperature at around 68 see that
temperatures place the MSI card at
around 70 C four FET seven and sixty
seventy four FET to the gigabyte card
runs a hotter vrm with its fat's around
82 see that said these VRMs are both
well within any reasonable operating
range you're not going to get D rating
that eighty-two Celsius on the gigabyte
card we're so far away from that 125 C
kind of threshold point that it's fair
to say both cards are doing their job
well especially considering gigabyte and
MSI use different driver ICS and best to
begin with so it's not a perfectly
linear comparison we're not comparing
just the coolers we're comparing the vrm
and the coolers since the overall vrm
solution is different in addition to the
cooling differences neither card is
performing poorly here if you're curious
about the noise profile for each device
at these fan speeds check the link in
the article below and in that article we
also have the clock stability over time
versus temperature for the gigabyte card
this next part of the thermal testing is
pretty interesting we've done a beat
estimate back plates in the past
generally they're more for structural
support than for cooling but that
doesn't stop manufacturers from saying
that they're for cooling there is an
exception where when we tested the EVGA
FTW ftw2 cards which is the icx version
we did actually see a benefit from that
backplate and that was primarily after
EVGA accounted for their lack of thermal
pads on the original FTW versions and FC
versions and things like that
so we did actually see a benefit in that
use case because of the very specific
design of the card it doesn't mean it
applies to all cards a backplate can act
as something of a hotbox if there's no
good contact between it and the board
below it or the board components at
least so that's something we test for
this card's a little
different because it does have the
copper insert which is very specifically
designed to at least look like a
heatsink for the backside of the GPU
itself so we wanted to test that it's
easy to remove and we can leave the rest
of the backplate on when doing the test
for these a/b tests that's exactly what
we did and we tested a few different
ways one we tested it with the just on
and off and then our standard very light
airflow from the open bench the second
test use a direct cooling solution of a
fan mounted about an inch or two above
the backplate and so it was pointing
straight down at it as basically an
intake then that was because when you're
testing something like a copper heat
sink or what's supposed to be one you
really want some kind of dissipation
solution because if you're just racking
up the heat on the heatsink and you have
no way to dissipate it the numbers
aren't going to look like they probably
should in a more real-world use case now
that said this thing's a bit far away
from the front of a case and you might
have memory in the way so we've
accounted for both those scenarios the
first test is more of a real case where
you're not directing airflow
specifically at the insert on the back
side and then the other test is lighter
airflow in terms of fan speeds we
configured them at locked to 60 percent
on the card for all tests and that's the
common fan speed that the card reaches
when under load and real gaming
scenarios so that's what we chose for
the testing the thermocouples and diodes
are allowed to reach a steady state
prior to proceeding with the
benchmarking that's important as well
because it takes a little bit of time to
get there and then we're logging ambient
seconds a second and using that to
calculate a delta value against the
thermocouples and the GPIO temperature
that way we can account for the one to
two Celsius ambient fluctuation and
uncertainty that is inherent to every
test starting the a/b tests with just
one case fan positioned about 10 inches
away from the GP backside with the usual
sticks of RAM between the family card we
see the chart that's on the screen now
these numbers are with the backplate on
the card so that copper inserts there
and we've propped the temperature scale
in to 0 to 60 C just to help better show
deviation and the numbers once we start
adding things into the chart all the
values are in delta T we're accounting
for ambient in these measurements that
helps kind of equalize for variance in
the test and
and as shown here we're seeing that the
1080 TI extreme runs it's bet seven and
bet two temperatures nearly identically
they've built a very consistent vrm
across the entire board both at roughly
53 Celsius delta T when under load and
the power virus scenario the PCB
backside temperature with the probe
affixed behind the fest and inductors
which is about the hottest part of the
backside measures at around 49 to 50
Celsius delta T load the GPU diode
temperature is bouncing around near 43
to 45 Celsius delta T and next we can
remove that insert leaving the rest of
the backplate on and run the test again
what you're looking at now is a whole
bunch of lines on top of each other
fortunately it happen to be sectioned
off in a very easy to follow fashion
with the help of some on-screen
highlights the top pairing of lines is
for the FETs there are actually four
lines here but they're all covering each
other because they're about the same
temperature that's two and seven with
the backplate on and off are effectively
identical in performance so there's no
real difference here we cannot
confidently state that there is a
significant difference between these
numbers with or without the copper plate
and it doesn't really it just doesn't
impact that temperatures as you might
expect we can next look at the PC
backside temperatures those you might
think would be more likely to be
affected given that the plate is
conducting heat away from the back of
the PCB and therefore potentially out of
a potential hot box scenario that could
be caused by the back plate there's no
real difference here either though the
two lines we've highlighted now show
that the PCB backside temperature is
effectively identical with and without
the plate and let's now highlight the
last two lines at the bottom these are
for the GPS diode temperature again it's
a delta T reading there is no
significant difference here and our
confidence interval is not tight enough
to declare a potential 0.5 C advantage
we've got about a 1 C range of
confidence these numbers are effectively
identical with the help of more video
editing we can also highlight the front
of the curve before this overtime chart
and that's why by the way overtime
charts are really valuable we can
highlight the 200 to 350 second mark
vertically and show that the plate does
not even impact the ramped up
temperature of the components measured
the temperature is increased at the same
pace regardless of its presence and
because our test is automated we can see
this quite clearly well there's a chance
we need better air flow
Oh to actually see the value of this
since if it's soaking heat but not
dissipating we're not really testing it
to its fullest potential so that's where
this next set comes in we've added a 120
millimeter case pan about an inch or two
above it going straight down at max rpm
powered by the power supplied directly
and that will give us those readings
another thing to note is the place of
measurements you might see more of a
difference on the caps on the backside
but we'll talk with that in a moment
so with the direct fan here's the chart
with the back plate on we now have a fan
directly pointed out that plate
temperatures overall are slightly better
on the back plate diode than in our
previous test which shows that the extra
airflow is getting down the backside of
the card and actually cooling things so
far our numbers look mostly the same as
before though the FETs number 2 &amp;amp; 7 are
nearly the same temperature and run
around 51 to 53 Celsius delta T over
ambient PCB backside temperature is now
around 46 to 48 C delta T and GPIO
temperatures about 43 to 45 Celsius
delta T removing the copper insert and
back plate we can now add the rest of
the lines that's 2 &amp;amp; 7 in both the a and
B tests are nearly identical once again
that 7 with the plate off is slightly
advantaged though we're not confident
enough to state if that's because
additional air is getting to the back
plate that could be the case since that
7 is also in the exact spot opposite the
board anyway where there's no thermal
pad coverage to the back plate since the
LED tape is there instead and we have
some footage of that from the tear down
this stated the difference is hardly
more than 1 Celsius so we can't really
confidently confirm a meaningful
difference but if there is one it would
probably be because air is getting it
where there are no thermal pads and
helping get rid of some of the heat the
PCB backside temperatures are also
effectively identical to end of the day
even with the help of the direct airflow
and the GPIO temperatures are not
meaningfully different either based on
our test and it does not appear that the
copper insert on the backplate actually
does anything of value it's not aiding
or hurting temperatures in any
meaningful way that said it's probably
conducting some of the heat away from
the specific spots it's touching via
thermal pad or maybe those four caps on
the back side of the card you could put
a thermocouple there and measure it the
thing is it's just it's relevant because
temperatures are going to be fine up in
that spot anyway the PCB itself the sort
of
hopper and fiberglass mixture really
doesn't care if it's an extra five C
warmer we just measure the backside
because of the EVGA into them last year
and the caps aren't going to be a
problem to begin with so any advantage
that is had in the areas we haven't
measured is irrelevant that's just
that's how this goes the backplate
itself is more for structural support it
is a large card you probably want to
leave it on there the copper insert
doesn't really do a whole lot this is a
marketing stunt it is for marketing
reasons it's not something that's
necessarily bad
all of these companies do it MSI
certainly has all of their own marketing
as do most of the other cards that are
on the market so we're not going to slam
them for it it's just don't think it's
going to help you either this is not
really something that's relevant now
that said there are a lot more ways to
test this one would be different fan
speeds we tested at 60% speed because
when you're gaming in our testing the
fan profile on this card by default
tends to push you to about 60% fan speed
max and other than that it's basically
idle so that's what we tested at if you
ran maybe a 30% fan speed you might see
a slight benefit we didn't test it
there's a time limitation here but for
our tests no difference for noise
testing you can check the article below
that'll all be down there
but moving on to the overclocking notes
the gaming X and the extreme gaming
cards that would be a Messiaen gigabyte
respectively both have similar
limitations with overclocking we
couldn't push them that much higher than
their shipping speeds and that's just
because boost 3.0 basically pushes the
clock to its absolute limit anyway
higher than the advertised speed within
the power constraints as defined by the
board partner so we've got the speed
stepping on the screen ultimately we had
to back it down a little bit for all the
games though it was able to succeed in
fire strike for the most part at higher
frequencies it is not sustainable for
all gaming but will include some of
those numbers to the game bench is going
forward now for a game testing
methodology drivers test bench specs and
all of that you can check the article
linked in the description below
moving on first to Ghost Recon wildlands
we start off with our GQ benchmarking at
4k the msi 1080 TI gaming x and gigabyte
nati horas extreme both plays around 57
to 58 FPS average our stock gaming X
model runs a higher maximum frequency
out of the box given the variance in one
basic quality and to the 300 watt out of
box power limit on the gaming X which
helps increase the clock Headroom over
the roughly to 75 watts on the Auris
extreme you could max out the power
sliders on each to get something similar
to our gaming X + or OC numbers in this
chart as stated in the gaming extra view
there's just not a ton to be gained from
overclocking these cards in particular
and frame time variants potentially
increases which isn't a good thing as
clock stability becomes threatened even
though the averages might increase the
GN hybrid mod of the FE card removed a
thermal limits giving it more Headroom
than you gain on either of these cards
just because it's not pushed as high as
these are out of box and both of them
are adequately cooled at 1440p it's more
the same a 1080i extreme and 1080i
gaming X both $750 cards run at about
the same FPS roughly 94 in the average
Dept and roughly eighty one fps 1% lows
roughly 77 fps 0.1% lows the cards
provide an identical experience at 1440p
overclocking it gives some boost to the
average FPS but as seen in the gaming
XOC slot we do take a slight hit to
frame times it's ultimately a trade of
how much you want to give in consistency
for the higher overall throughput even
the hybrid OC has some stability issues
decrease in its frame time consistency
so this is a normal thing we can
actually plot that too by the way it's
not necessarily an appreciable
difference to the user depending on how
unstable the clocks are but illustrates
a point that overclocking these high-end
devices means encountering potential
voltage or power constraints that choke
the clock finally at 1080p the Auris
extreme in gaming X again perform more
or less identically it we're sort of
within the standard deviation test test
here
overclocking can get us a bump an
average FPS with the same potential
pitfalls as earlier discussed both the
gaming X and horas are about 5.8 percent
better than the stock EFI card or about
1.9 percent better than the EFI card
when the thermal constraint is removed
we're now moving on to for honor which
is one of the most GPU intensive games
we currently test at 4k resolution
Laura's extreme card lands itself
around where
a liquid-cooled mod of the founders
edition card performs or about two FPS
behind the gaming X once again that's
the power limit coming into play and
we're sort of running at full tilt with
these 4k benchmarks which is what's
showing the difference overclocking
produces particularly bad frame times
this title so we generally leave it out
the experience is not much improved over
the stock card at least not unless
you're willing to pay out in the frame
time variants Department for the higher
average or just run a lower overclock in
the best circumstances we're getting an
extra six to nine FPS on average out of
the ten atti cards here's the same game
with 1440p testing the Auris card
performs about the same as our 1080 TI
hybrid fe mod and a few FPS under the
1080i gaming X from MSI there's not a
significant difference here yet again
though they are about the same price
pushing the power limit a bit higher
would more or less equalize these cards
and for 1080p results you can check the
article link of the description below
running Doom at 4k with Vulcan for the
API we see the Auris extreme card about
3% behind the gaming X once again and
out of box performance with overclocking
actually proven useful in this game
clock stability as a whole is better in
Doom than in for honor and so the other
games we test and so the frame times
generally see a performance improvement
rather than a performance hit well
highlight do see numbers on the chart
between the game and X an extreme card
they try to differentiate a bit more in
this department but out of box reforms
again is mostly equal the MSI gaming X
takes a slight lead in stock the 1080p
if' e card runs about 6% slower than the
oars extreme card when using that stock
heatsink or about 0.7 percent slower
when using an hour fe hybrid mod for
1440p results see the article below and
now moving on to Sniper Elite 4 with the
x12 and async compute the Auris extreme
card runs at around 84 FPS average with
lows at 69 and 64 FPS respectively Emma
sighs gaming X operates approximately
one point nine percent faster out of box
with averages at 86 and gns coin one
percent low and 0.1 percent low metrics
at seventy two point eight and sixty
nine point seven FPS this difference
isn't appreciable to the end-user you
will not notice it but it isn't
measurable and repeatable we are again
seeing out of box power configuration at
play is the easily modified if you
really needed that
X
one frame per second overall versus the
unmodified F II card the RS extreme runs
about 11% faster or about 1/2 percent
faster than the liquid-cooled hybrid as
we're not hitting the thermal limit on
the clocks Mass Effect Andromeda 4k
resolution shows the same scaling as all
the other games out of box the Auris
card places a bit below the gaming ex
the overclocking assists the gigabyte
card in some ways the difference between
the stock devices is not appreciable to
the end-user if once again but is again
measurable and repeatable we're at 69
FPS average for the 6 1% low and 53 0.1%
low on the gaming X or 66 FPS average 55
FPS 1% low and 51 FPS 0% lows on the
Auris extreme 1440p follows this trend
with the cards now at 133 and 129 FPS
respectively the low scale linearly on
these this difference makes the gaming X
about 3% faster out of box just like in
previous tests yours extreme is that 2%
faster than a thermally unconstrained F
II card using our hybrid mod and if you
want to see 1080p results you can check
the article below you can also find
ashes of the singularity down there
which is a DX 12 bench as was Sniper
Elite and you can find our 3d mark fire
strike and - buy tests in the article
below now this card has one of the
biggest coolers we've looked at lately
in terms of noise levels the or scarred
tends to run a bit higher rpm on its
three fans on average than the MSI card
because the RS car just has a more
aggressive fan profile than the MSI card
does emicida card also has large fans
and that means that they can spin them a
bit slower and move similar air the fans
on the msi Kart are also quite obviously
limited to a count of two so that's a
difference noise levels not hugely
different because ultimately you can
lower the aggressive fan curve on both
of these devices and still retain
operable temperatures if that's the kind
of thing you want to tune for noise is a
very subjective thing that we have DBA
numbers in the chart in the article the
gaming X is roughly 3% faster out of box
and the games we've tested then the
Auris extreme card that's not an
appreciable difference it is a
measurable difference and one that is
mostly attributable to the stock power
budget or at least power target for
these cards out of box it tends to vary
about 25 watts between them and
of course there's a sick quality model
to model as well or at least unit to
unit overclocking or at least pushing
the power limit to the max will more or
less equalize these devices that said
it's not necessarily worth overclocking
the 1080 TI devices from what we've seen
so far they're pretty much at the clock
limit of where they can be largely
thanks to boost 3.0 and how it functions
the copper backplate on this thing the
insert doesn't really do anything but it
also doesn't hurt so it's not it's not
an aid it's not a detriment it just
exists and as more copper being used
probably where it shouldn't be in our
testing there may be a scenario where
it's helpful we haven't found it and we
did some pretty detailed passing on it
so overall looks more or less like a
marketing thing for the copper insert on
the backplate now the backplate itself
is functional it's structural support
these cards when they're as large as
both of these are can actually use it to
prevent sag or prevent any kind of
damage long-term especially when you're
looking at a size who might ship things
although they tend to ship reference
cards so it is functional just not for
cooling really our price is the same as
the gaming X these are both $750 cards
they're both $50 more than the F II card
which has a cooler we don't really like
the FP card the PCB is actually built
really well this time so that poses an
interesting challenge where you could
probably buy an Fe PCB at least a
reference one with a better cooler on it
or stick your own cooler on it and be
quite happy with the result if you want
cards that do well out of the box and
never want to touch them in overclocking
or in physical Hardware mods these are
fine it just it's another question of
you could buy probably a $700 gigabyte
model with the three fan cooler or 700
ish 7 $20 EVGA SC model or anything like
that
Strix one of the cheaper ones anyway
anything like those cards we've got a
decent coil you could buy one of those
have more or less the same experience
within a couple percent so it again
comes down to how much money are you
willing to pay for anywhere from 1 to 4
or 5 percent difference over the $700
cards if the answer is $50 these are
both fine cards the Emma
tywanza bit faster out of box this one's
just kind of better-looking in terms of
the RGB LEDs if you care about that but
that more allows some of things up so if
you remove the thermal constraint the
advantage over the EPI cards about 1 to
3% if you remove the constraints these
are more or less equal of them the outer
box difference noise tester in the
article differences in that huge though
