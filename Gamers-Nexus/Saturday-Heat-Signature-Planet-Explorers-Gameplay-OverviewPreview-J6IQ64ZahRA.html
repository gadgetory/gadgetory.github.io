nexus dotnet and we are back from pax
east is the first video back and for
this one we're doing saturday heat
signature which of course focuses down
on a single upcoming game or project and
brings it to our attention so for this
one we are talking about a kickstarter
project called planet explorers by
pathia games and this game has got a
huge scope but at its heart it's an
open-world sandbox / exploration game
centered around user-generated content
and survival and it's it's a sci fi game
it's in space really in short your
colony ship you were on a colony ship
traveling to a new planet it crashed it
landed on a strange planet and it's up
to you to survive the first night
establish a camp and keep the remaining
few npcs alive via recruitment channels
which we'll talk about in a moment you
have to scrounge up resources like food
weapons shelter all sorts of stuff and
basically does stay alive and expand
your colony so players will be able to
enter the a creation mode i just
mentioned weapons and shelter you're
able to enter a creation mode to
construct those and just about any other
really vehicle structure weapon mech all
kinds of stuff that you want to create
and the game uses non cuboid voxels for
its terrain and the object generation so
when I say voxel a couple times through
this video it doesn't mean voxel like
minecraft terrain or like I don't know
cube world it's it's just instead of
vertices we're using voxels and that is
really the end of that so it does allow
on the fly and point by point terrain
and object manipulation and generation
so as with most voxel games you've got a
lot of creativity and control thereof so
there's a lot to explain here I'm going
to break down into consumable parts and
we will start with the game modes and
then dive into each mode independently
the developers have currently targeted
the inclusion of three primary
single-player modes and a couple of
multiplayer modes and on the
single-player front we've got promises
of an expansive unique story mode with a
custom world custom accompanying
and written adventure path all that
stuff complete with conclusion even
there is an ends to the game and various
RPG elements along the way there's also
promise of an adventure mode which aims
to focus on procedurally generated
alternatives to the story world and
allow for more freeform play and in this
random missions will be available for
the players like tower defense esque
events and assault missions stuff like
that and then the final plan the
single-player mode is build mode which
as the name suggests is really just for
sandbox construction just like mine
crafts creative mode and I really hate
to keep using minecraft here as compared
comparison but a lot of people are
familiar with it so you know I apologize
if that annoys you no enemies will be
present and in the in the build mode and
infinite building materials will be
available so it's it's just a sandbox to
test what you want to do creations
editors will be available to construct
new vehicles weapons and so forth now
multiplayer will offer mode archetypes
in the form of co-op and competitive
play each of which have numerous
subtypes that I won't get into very
deeply because I mean honestly I'm not
too sure I believe that the developers
will be able to fully implement the
promised dota like modes tower defense
mode capture the flag and base defense
subtypes no offense to them I am sure
they are fantastically skilled far more
than I am it just seems like a massive
scope and I don't want to dive too
deeply into that right now so regardless
at the center of everything is survival
and construction it's your job to set up
a base camp and eventually expand into a
colony and whether that's in story or
adventure mode or other modes the world
is complete with caves mountains
volcanoes wastelands and all manner of
other biomes each with unique enemies to
to really flesh out the planet and make
it feel strange and alive and alien
story mode uses a unique continent
that's been handcrafted by the
developers and will have a clear arc to
follow in terms of story but adventure
mode in the style of other recent voxel
games like Q world and castles
we will randomly generate terrain and
resources to create new experiences with
each playthrough so that's the gist of
those players will be able to farm heard
hunt and fish for food resources which
are then distributed amongst NPC is if
you have any to keep them alive to keep
yourself alive and are also players are
also able to gather resources with
traditional pathways like mining I would
imagine other forms perhaps you know
wood cutting or something like that and
use those gathered resources in
construction of bases or technology and
once you've constructed a base
settlement you'll be able to recruit
NPCs and upgrade buildings to
effectively establish a fully functional
town the capabilities of the NPCs are
not yet clear we don't know if they'll
be shopkeepers or just kind of there
like testificandum attic pathway to
conflict resolution is possible when
enemies arise and enemies will try to
assault your town try to kill the NPC's
stuff like that so you will be able to
have a fully diplomatic path way if you
want to be like I don't know say captain
picard you could do that but war is
always another option and we haven't
even gotten into multiplayer yet and
it's been almost six minutes though it's
really it's it's mostly just more of the
same from what I've read and accept with
more players and again to make the
minecraft comparison strictly in terms
of play style planet explorers has a lot
of similarities just with a few key huge
differences like a focus on exploration
and more interesting combat and enemies
so you've got a lot more action driven
play with the capability the supplement
of building towns and all that other
stuff tech I want to make a quick note
that this is a Kickstarter project and
the developers have made tons of
promises that they may or may not be
able to deliver on more money doesn't
necessarily mean more skill or a more
refined game yada yada you know the
pitch if you want to donate please do so
wisely and research the game thoroughly
hopefully this video has given you
something to look forward to though the
game does look seriously cool and it has
a lot of potential
and really at this point it's just a
matter of whether the developers are
able to deliver and keep the scope under
control to prevent another spore and
with that I don't want to leave on a
cold bitter note seriously take a look
at the game it's called planet explorers
by path yeah I will have a link in the
description below along with a full
article that basically summarizes this
video so with that I will see you all
next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
