at CES 2019 showing two of the new case
there's also a power supply will mention
kind of briefly at the end of the video
but focusing on the cases budget class
has been a primary point this year for
we saw cooler matched I had a couple new
budget cases there are several others
we'll be looking at later in the show so
it's been a big driver for case
manufacturers and Corsair wants to be
part of that they've got a refresh 275
are now called the 275 q and then behind
me there's a speck delta which if you
remember the speck alpha it's the same
type of ID it's just been it changed in
a few ways we'll go over all that before
that this video is brought to you by the
gigabyte z 390 ARS master motherboard
which comes equipped with one of the
more powerful z3 90 V RMS for heavier
overclocks on the new 9th Gen Intel CPUs
the ARS master is also one of the few
motherboards with a real heatsink this
generation featuring a mix of high
surface area fins and looks oriented
cover blocks oh and it's also got
updated RTV illumination learn more at
the link below
starting with the 275 q so let's get the
price not the way I guess $90 and then
behind me $80 to the spec Delta so 90
for the 275 q this case changes from the
275 R by changing the R to a Q which
means quiet so high you could surmise
then that there are going to be foam
damping panels so you got foam on the
left on the right and on the top not on
the front but there's a thinner foam so
it is not the perforated kind but it's
just a flat foam and we can test in in
noise testing how that performs in terms
of cooling of course cooling is the
counterpart to noise we talked about how
that's a difficult balance and you've
probably seen some of our videos on that
but the front panel is the same as the
275 R we did a review on the 275 R it's
pretty limited airflow already but there
is a front center fan it's PWM so that's
an upgrade from the 275 R which was
dealt a DC control and then the rear fan
is PWM as well so 120 in the front
Center splitting air between CPU and GPU
which is probably for the best so that's
better positioning than we've seen from
some of the other cases we've reviewed
lately and then one top rear 120
millimeters now this is a more limited
airflow case to begin with as you saw in
our original review so thermals will be
more or less the same plus or minus the
Delta between the fan speeds
if you're interested in a quiet version
then of course it's worth checking out
we might review it and see how the noise
performance is later I guess few key
items to note if you didn't see the 275
our review previously there's no power
supply shroud which we actually prefer
that it does help with GPO thermals
quite a bit so no power supply shroud
they've added a PWM a fan repeater to
the backside so you can plug in all the
fans into that that repeater and plug
that into the motherboard be a PWM
rather than DC control hard drive cages
bottom center or just like the 275 R and
I I mean I think that's pretty much it I
will point this out though no more allen
keys it's required for removing the
screws in the side panel so side panel
is now switched to normal Phillips head
which is perfect and what we want to see
that's because it's not tempered glass
because the focus is quiet so not having
classic white case probably a good move
and something that again start with the
case we've looked at have overlooked
recently so so that's the 275 Q pretty
straightforward we might review it it's
it it's a 275 are refreshed which is an
improved 270 are in some ways and then
the spec Delta behind me spec Delta's
the opposite side of the spectrum in
some ways because so this one if you
remember the spec al that kind of looks
vaguely similar with the geometric shape
on the front panel it's an acrylic front
panel and there is a bit of a cutout for
air on the bottom so bottom fan has
probably like 80% access to air which is
not bad top fans got a little tiny bent
here with some plastic bracing around it
so not a ton of of you need a lot of
pressure to get that top fan to do
anything and you need even more to get
the middle fan to do anything but if
you're going for symmetry and RGB looks
then I guess that's what you'd get
because this does include all RGB events
for the front it's got a blackout fan
for the back and the three front fans
are there supposed to be new new RGB SKU
from Corsair I don't know the details on
it yet but it does get rid of the
requirement for a separate controller
for the LEDs which is good so you just
plug them into normal fan headers into
the motherboard and they'll work just
fine but otherwise I mean it's got a
power supply shroud it extends all the
way to the front but there's a cutout
for the radiator in the front so
or the fans in the front as well 3 120 s
currently 1 120 in the rear the top has
a 240 radiator mounted to it this is a
competitor to cooler masters lower end I
think was the master box I think his
name of that case dust filter porous
with a magnet on it so pretty pretty
standard features to the most part in an
$80.00 case this would be competing
directly with something like the NZXT H
500 the cooler master master box cases
along those lines and if you consider it
then some of course there's no older
cases as well and I think the the point
here is basically do you like how it
looks because cases are gonna come down
to your performance for some people and
looks for the other if you like how it
looked then there's nothing I can tell
you that really matters if you want
performance by something else like the
RL zero six or something similar to that
but we'll look at it more in the future
perhaps this is entirely Alix oriented
case if that's your thing cool it is
it's here it suspect Alta if you want to
look it up when it comes out so that
will wrap the case is will show some
b-roll of the power supply briefly power
supplies proper SFX power supply it has
a 93 millimeter fan on it and that's
really the the main detail so I think
this one is going the one they have here
is 750 watt and if you wanted a properly
small power supply then that would be a
good option to consider there's not a
ton of true SFX PS use out there and
that would be one of them other than
that
another small note coarser has gone the
white out approach for some of its
product so the the H 100 I have 240
millimeter CLC that now has a white
variant and it's $15 more than MSRP for
the normal version so that's it that's
that's the most interesting stuff that's
on the component DIY side act Corsair
