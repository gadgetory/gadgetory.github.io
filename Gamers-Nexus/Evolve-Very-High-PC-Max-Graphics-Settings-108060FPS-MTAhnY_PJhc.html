nexus dotnet and today we're looking at
evolve in benchmark form so what you're
looking at right now is the course that
Iran when benchmarking evolved the new
one versus for game that's coming out by
2k and all the benchmark results are in
the link in the description below it is
online already and we have a second
video with those results but what you're
looking at right now is the course I
used when benchmarking the game this was
a two-minute circuit that I repeated
three times during each test with all
video cards involved and it was
conducted almost identically every
single time so there was really no room
for error to be made just was not
possible in this course and that's
because I eliminated dynamic combat
elements beyond what is presented in the
tutorial that you play and evolve so
there's not any crazy new graphics
technology and evolve it looks great
don't get me wrong the models for player
characters and for the monster also a
player character are high poly models
they're very high quality and the reason
that 2k can get away with this is
because there's not really a whole lot
else going on in terms of models you
don't have all these AI and other
enemies just a few a few roaming
dinosaurs every now and then so most of
our resources are spent on the player
character models which is pretty cool
they do look good and yeah but you can
see a lot of detail on the monsters
muscles and things like that there's a
good deal of resources spent in the
environment but it's nothing to write
home to it's not amazing new gadre
technology or something because we all
know you need more god rays and more
lens flares and things like that no
there's nothing quite like that this
time just some some nice-looking
environments with the existing
technology so that is evolve out the
link in the description below or just
check out the channel for the benchmark
video with tables and performance and
things like that and I will see you all
next time peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
