GPU benchmark for Gears of War 4 which
has now been fully rectified with this
content today and that error was really
a result primarily of having three
different people working on the
benchmarks this is a growing operation
and also a mix of the game having 40
graphics settings and Python script to
interpret data and then present Mon
which is also sort of new to
benchmarking because it is a DX 12 title
so there were a lot of variables going
on and it's been corrected basically the
error boils down to a simple thin its
chart generation all of the tests
thankfully we're actually valid 2/3
results were valid tests were good the
data was accurate but they weren't put
on the right charts so basically we had
AMD and NVIDIA on the same chart using
different settings for 1440p and for
1080p 4k was fine so the chart
generation error created an
unintentional misrepresentation of data
for that you have my apologies I have
corrected that we've also done some
extra tests now so now we have a
throw-in card of the GTX 1063 gigabyte
that was not on there originally thought
that'd be fun to look at the difference
of three verses six gigabyte performance
we've added that we also have proper
ultra tests this time for 1080p and 1440
so now we have 1440 1080 P at high and
at Ultra and we have 4k at high as
previously let's get to it first off
Gears of War 4 is a uwp title that's
DirectX 12 enabled which means that
usual testing via fps overlays isn't
supported for that reason we're using
present model with an in-house built
Python script to analyze the data and
create 1% in point one percent low
outputs that we use in our normal fraps
and fraps testing and the game also has
a few dozen graphic settings as I said
about 40 that really complicate the
testing but we've gone through them and
defined the majority of them in the
article and we've also made sure that
they are applying correctly to the
different settings used for testing what
you're looking at now is the first 30
seconds of the Gears of War 4 benchmark
this is the course that we use primarily
for graphics testing with our present
montt commands set to expire right
around with the camera angle changes you
can also see our Gears of War for
maximum graphics video which shows some
of this benchmark
info on the channel we used high
settings for 4k and properly used ultra
settings at 14
piano 1080p but we've also gone back and
added high settings for those two
resolutions drivers used were
recommended by Microsoft AMD and NVIDIA
alongside the required Windows 10
anniversary update and that includes the
nvidia 3:7 3.2 drivers and an d 16 10.1
which are the same as 16 9.2 for Gears
of War 4 the optimizations are the same
in each an AMD has done some
optimizations we spoke with their team
about that starting with 1920 by 1080
properly configured to high settings
across the board we're still hitting a
bit of a CPU bottleneck with the high
end devices as limited at approximately
155 FPS average with our third 59 30 K
at 3.8 gigahertz that is the limiter
here the GT X 1080 the old man 980ti and
the gtx 1070 are all peaking at around
150 FPS average showing no issues
whatsoever with Gears of War 4 at 1080p
with high settings the low framerate
performance is reasonably tightly timed
with each card dipping at its lowest to
105 FPS at the 0.1% low metric or the
slowest 0.1% of frames output as
represented by frame times this plants
Nvidia close to 120 Hertz displays and
actually beyond it depend on if you're
looking at averages or not and gears
won't work for isn't exactly a game
where you need that you barely even need
60 honestly but it's at least doing well
with the lows moving down the hierarchy
the AMD r9 fury X is now pushing
significantly better performance than
what we saw with ultra hitting 124 FPS
average and lows of 90 2.8 fps and 63
FPS respectively that number is
deceptive though and it's for the same
reasons that we discussed originally
that has not changed we are still seeing
critical variance between test passes
with AMD devices at least some of them
and here's a quick look at some of the
raw data from the fury X running on high
settings where we're seeing as we were
seen before with ultra a dip to 25 FPS
for the absolute lowest output in the
0.1%
lo metrics not the minimum but a point 1
percent low and an output of 96.2 FPS
for the point 1 percent low in another
one of the test runs that's a range of
70 FPS for the absolute lowest
performance in point 1% metrics which
manifests itself occasionally at least
once every minute or two as a stutter or
hitch and framerate fluidity and if you
look at the averages you'll see that and
these are nine px remains fairly
consistent in its average output it's
just these low values
it suffers now this is also an important
note to make about testing and why our
efforts to make this Python script are
really worth it this time actually well
it's always worth it but especially now
because if you look at the minimums
output by presentment if you use present
modern launcher or if you're just
looking through the data manually the
minimum is really useless it's almost
always an outlier and when we run
through the numbers and look at a 1%
0.1% metric we get these outputs that
are much more consistent and accurate
with what you're seeing on the screen
the minimum because it's one frame out
of thousands is not really a good
representation of the low-side
performance of cards that's why we're
doing this just to quickly show gears
over for at 1080p with the ultra preset
settings here's a look at the
performance on both AMD and NVIDIA with
that preset applied we're seeing 143 FPS
average output on the GT x 1080 FTW
hybrid 98 FPS average output on the r9
fury X the difference again is in the
low performance when you're seeing some
of these stuttering and gameplay and
some of this can be seen in our review
of gears over 4 already published on the
channel those stutters do appear during
gameplay but the averages are good for
and the overall and really this can be
problematic at low end excuse for NVIDIA
- like the 1068 1440 it's just a matter
of AMD and the coalition working
together hopefully to stabilize the
low-end performance for those cards at
14:40 with high settings the GTX 1080
FTW hybrid from EVGA is now sitting at
130 1.7 FPS average with tightly time to
lows including exceptionally consistent
low frame time performance as shown in
this raw data on the screen with a 980ti
trailing there's a noteworthy gap
between Pascal and Maxwell performance
when it comes to the low values and
that's something which has been improved
upon by Nvidia for this generation of
GPUs the GTX 1070 and 1062 game well at
1440p with the AMD r9 fury X operating
at nearly 89 FPS average just above the
GTX 970 SSC from EVGA and the GTX 1060
gaming acts from msi at 75 FPS average
effectively the 917 1060 in this tests
are identical in performance and that's
really only differentiated by Pascal
pushing higher low values next the MSI R
X 480 gaming acts at 13 16 megahertz
is operating competitively to the 970
and the 1060 with a 70 3.8 FPS average
though it's low performance is just as a
variable as we've seen in the other test
that we previously published and we'll
be publishing again in a moment we saw
at least one visible stutter in
framerate output in the test runs but
AMD has a reasonable foundation with its
average FPS to improve upon performance
in the lows with future updates as they
did with doom with a 390 series when
that card saw 25 percent increase just
from a driver update about a week or two
later ultra is sustainable at 1080p on
the r9 380 xrx 470 GTX 970 and up the
AMD cards at the low end again needs
some extra adjustment to deal with those
drops as for 1440p at Ultra we're seeing
performance output of about a hundred
FPS on the GTX 1080 with reasonable lows
that are just below 60fps see 706 FPS on
the r9 fury X + 62 FPS on the msi r9
390x remember the low values for AMD are
a little deceptive here again for the
same reasons that we just stated
previously since the variance is so
great that some test passes will make
those values appear higher than they are
during certain runs or an extended
gameplay the GTX 1060 has a little bit
of trouble with stutters at 1440p but it
could be made playable with the drops
down to high from ultra on a couple of
settings like SSR and the rx 480 is in
the same boat and could also be made
more fluid with a few fine-tuned setting
tweaks the final chart hasn't changed
nor has the one paragraph of the script
talking about it the tests are all using
high settings at 4k and were since the
start and 4k high gears or 4 is handled
at approximately 70 FPS by the EVGA 1080
FTW hybrid with a 1070 SC following 34%
behind at 50 3.3 FPS average last
generation 980ti still have classes
pascals
1070 at 57 FPS average of though it does
exhibit a wider FPS range overall which
plays to the one percent in point one
percent metrics we're showing as for AMD
the company is headed up by its fury X
at 50 FPS average followed by the msi r9
390x at 43 average and the our X 480
gaming X at 38 point 1 FPS average 4k is
relatively playable across most of the
hardware that we've tested here
particularly if you're willing to dip
some settings down to medium for the RX
480
because gears isn't a
particularly fast-paced game and a hard
60fps isn't mandated for a good
experience though it may be desired you
could always get away with a slightly
lower fps depending on how you feel
about your gameplay and this next chart
shows setting scallion which also hasn't
changed from it previously here's a look
at these settings scale that using some
average test passes between devices this
gives an overall look at performance and
how it scales between various presets so
if we didn't test the setting that
you're interested in you can use this
chart to extrapolate performance
relative to the tests we've conducted
there's not a huge visual difference
between ultra and high for the most part
but the vram impact is actually somewhat
substantial the game tends to sit at
around four point eight gigabytes maybe
five the RAM utilization by the end of
the benchmark run alone not talking
about the actual gameplay here and
that's as tested using eight gigabyte
GPUs the metric is output by the games I
own a built in performance monitor that
we're not entirely sure how it's
measuring vram but it is a newer API
it's low level and it should in theory
be more accurate than the vram request
metric you get from cheap easy or
similar software and while I've been
talking you should also be seeing visual
comparisons using some b-roll we
captured of identical test scenarios
that will help give an idea as to the
performance output with all of the
charts updated to properly contain the
data that they are meant to reflects we
can now reach a conclusion and it's
really somewhat similar to the original
conclusion which is that for low-end
performance you really need to pay
attention to those low values 1% point
1% below is because those manifests
themselves invisible stutters in
gameplay that we have b-roll of this is
seen on some Nvidia cards though less
frequently the GTX 1060 for example at
1440p ultra is not something I would
recommend you'd want to drop down to
about high or somewhere maybe in that
area to reduce the chance of a stutter
being encountered Andy it's a bit more
of a pervasive issue and we see this
across all the graphics settings we
tested for the most part and it
hopefully is an issue that can be
resolved with drivers or a game patch
and in talking to Andy we know that they
are working towards a conclusion this
technically 69 2 in 1610 one contain the
same driver optimizations for years over
for this is officially stated by Andy
but the the future can still hold
improvement in that regard with the
frame time disparity we'll call where
there's less consistency in the frame
time
one frame to the next on some of the AMD
devices overall the game is fairly
playable even with the higher-end ultra
settings with high settings 1080p you
can play on pretty much every card we
showed on that benchmark chart and the
same is true for 1440p at high 4k is a
little more different but it's obviously
4k so you're at a 200% scaling from
1080p it's an issue just because a
resolution but overall the cards that
are out this generation pretty much
handle Gears of War 4 without too much
issue at 1080p RX 4 sixties pushed it a
little bit you can drop the settings
maybe slightly to medium for some
fine-tuning and then 1440p the RX 480 is
mostly ok other than those low dips and
you can do some tuning to hopefully
resolve some of that to an acceptable
level 1068 1440 high is okay as well for
general performance so thank you again
