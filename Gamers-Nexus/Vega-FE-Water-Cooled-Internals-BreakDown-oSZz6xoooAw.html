Vega frontier edition liquid-cooled card
and I'm going to be doing a cool unit
breakdown for you talking about some of
the decisions OMD maybe have some
theories on why they made those
decisions these photos were sent to us
by a reader thank you to the reader who
sent them we're going to break it down
because we just bought the Vega frontier
- an air-cooled card and frankly that
was enough money spent on graphics cards
right now so looking to spin over we
have an inlet and an outlet going into
the pump blog let's label everything
first this is the pump block and then
we'll talk about this bit in a moment
but let's just go ahead and label this
as pump so we can get this started
pump there's your pump block and this
part is what's mounted directly to the
cold blade so there's a copper cold
plate under there the HBM the GPU are
both under there and if we look at the
lines for the cooling we can see that it
actually hits the block first so what we
think is happening right now is it looks
like the liquid comes in here there's
your inlet and then on the other end
it'll go out but there's an interesting
twist of this so let's just label these
inlet and then we think this is the
outlet so out that goes down this follow
this very carefully goes down this tube
and this is a cooler master cooler which
you can actually see by looking at the
tubing that this is their a Teflon inner
Teflon coating tubing which is the kind
that if you bend it too far and kink it
it'll crack that teflon coating and you
get a lot of permeation but up until
that point it's actually really good for
resisting the effects of permeation but
it's not the rubber style AC on for
example an ace attack so liquid goes
that direction comes back out into this
blue anodized plate this is an aluminum
plate it covers the V RMS and if you saw
our breakdown of the air cooled card
it's the exact same card and that layout
is the exact same so this is the V RM
right here and on the right side of the
card does
nothing it's just a blank PCB with the
air-cooled card you needed that space
for the blower fan but you don't need it
this time so they've allocated something
else to it so liquid goes this direction
now and at some point it will come back
out right here and that goes back to the
hex or the heat exchanger the hex on
this one is a bit different from the
fury acts I'll get to that photo in a
minute but the heat exchanger here we go
radiator is a bit different so on the
fury acts there's a tank that extends
and it's right here and that tank
contains an extra liquid the tank for
the fury acts theoretically gave it a
bit more lifespan because you hopefully
bypass some of the issues of permeation
over a long period like five years by
adding that additional liquid so that
the pump doesn't die quite as soon from
the liquid running out and permeating
the tubes it's not here on this card
instead we'll show you where it is in a
minute but the heat exchanger is a 38
millimeter wide radiator so that's more
similar to Intel DIY closed-loop cooler
which is 38 millimeters wide as well
rather than some of the smaller stuff
that you see on a lot of the 120
millimeter CPU coolers and even a bit
different from the P react the fan
however is about the same it's very
similar to a gentle typhoon this is
basically a gentle typhoon copy
acceptance by cooler master
it looks like the same fan that's on the
P react and that was actually a somewhat
decent fan so that's the heat exchanger
and then you can see the top of the card
over here the tach and then over here
getting back to this one so liquid flow
like I said comes in this way into the
inlet it cycles through the inner micro
fins and a cold plate this is just a
housing that doesn't actually do
anything that's just housing for the
cabling which is over here and this
cabling is for the pump control so it's
a PWM plus some extras so it's got four
pins for PWM and then an extra pen or
two for what we think are thermal
sensors but we're not positive this is
the
the other header which routes over this
way
and that's your fan power you can
actually see it's makeup over here and
that eventually leads to the fan down
one of these tubes over here so that's
what's going on there at the interesting
bit so the liquid comes in goes out over
here for the BRM colon comes back out
what we didn't talk about is this bit
and this arrow is pointed the wrong
direction but this part here if you look
at it it only has one tube going into
this tank so this is a what we think is
a reservoir because it is an aluminum
die cast tank on the right side with
only one possible way of entry or exit
there is not an inlet and an outlet
there's only what appears to be an
outlet the liquid can only go that
direction why would that exist well what
we think is happening is rather than
doing a tank on the radiator this time
it looks like what AMD has done is
they've used their extra space or rather
I should say Coolermaster they've used
the extra space on the PCB for a tank
and what's probably happening is when
there is an atmosphere drop in this part
over here in the main chamber and the
cooling loop when there's an atmosphere
drop and a pressure drop probably just
like a ballpoint pen what happens is the
liquid will feed from where it can it'll
feed from the higher pressure area which
is going to be over here so that'll go
down that tube and eventually pipe into
here theoretically you would do this to
help stave off the dropping pressure and
the permeation of liquid into the tubes
over time that's going to happen
eventually this housing here is actually
not aluminum it's a plastic I've been
told by the reader who sent this but
that doesn't mean it can't be some kind
of metal inside however the aluminum
shell of this one will help with the one
resistance of permeation over time and
potentially some kind of cooling benefit
we're not really positive on that either
way when there's not no drop here we get
some pressure change
forces the liquid over into the main
chamber theoretically extending the
lifespan of the cooler as a whole
because these things don't last forever
the liquid permeates eventually your
pump can't pull enough liquid through
and it dies so that's what we think now
part of the reason we think this is
because we go back to this picture you
can see something interesting which is
these circles over here and these if we
hide this layer and look at another
angle they kind of look like alan keyes
if you really look down into them and we
have a photo here but they're actually
not they're just straight cylinders
their circles holes and we think this
might be part of the pressure change
where that will allow the movement of
the liquid from this tank which is a
pretty phat radiate or a reservoir into
the other tank over there for use of
lengthening the lifespan of the cooler
because ultimately these things only
really last like five years anyway
before the liquid permeates and it
starts getting beyond use so it is
basically a venting for pressure if you
lose water it drops the atmosphere on
the inside over here and it pulls from
where it can get it that's what we think
that's for the chamber that has two
cylindrical holes is interesting because
we're curious why the pump isn't over
here it may just be because this was the
best way to do the extra water reservoir
but the pump is here that means two
pumps on the Coldplay's which means it's
potentially in the area where is that
called the patent and coolermaster and
the other companies for a while now I've
been trying to claim that the pump is
not on the cold plate so they can dodge
that patent issue so we're we're
interested in if there's a thermal
difference having the pump here where
traditionally atop the GPU and the HBM
rather than here where clearly this
isn't the pump because one it's not
powered there is zero power going to it
all of this is going to the other
chamber and then - there's only one way
for the liquid to flow so that's
reservoir and it feeds over pretty
interesting stuff now what other thing
you can also see that there is
some glycol on right here there's
actually some glycol residue you see
this kind of gross hardened chemical
around the side that's pretty standard
for liquid coolers where it's a bit of a
sloppy job but basically there's some
glycol around the edges and that's
hardened and become dry and so that's
how we know that that's got liquid in it
because the liquid contains and liquid
coolers is actually a distilled water
plus propylene glycol mix and you tend
to do a mix that allows whatever storage
temperature minimum that you want
negative 20 negative 40 C something like
that but there's some leakage over there
so this because it gives us a different
angle of the card we can also look at it
this way and you can see kind of how big
these tanks are compared to the rest of
the device the base plate is a little
bit different from the air-cooled car
they're actually making tooling to
different base plates and that is just
because the other one simply would fit
here it's got like a diecast thin stack
over here for the display out and then
it has a circle around the shroud there
so that there's a block for the fans
force all the air through the radiator
so that's not present on this card
instead we get this aluminum plate
liquid plate for the V RMS and this
design is very expensive so the design
that Andy has gone with and Coolermaster
is gone with here cost them a good bit
more than just a traditional pump on
block on core design so they've really
spent a lot of extra money on the tank
and on this piping system and all this
stuff rather than just doing a CLC on
the GPU core and then cooling the memory
with a via REM fan for example and doing
a traditional hybrid where you have the
blower over here a blower goes that
direction and then you cool the rest
with the CLC on the block and on the GPU
so very interesting decision here this
explains some of why the card is six
hundred dollars more than the air-cooled
card is it worth it
probably not you could probably and we
did do your own liquid cooling mod for a
whole hell of a lot cheaper and the
performance will be just fine is it
going to be pretty No
so if pretty is worth $600 for you this
is your solution but from what we've
seen so far it's just it's a very
expensive extravagant cooling solution
that does not necessarily beget the
value of having such an extravagant
solution but there's your other view of
it with a bit better color balance and
that's really all there is to this card
we pretty much some of these things are
informed speculation but this is really
a pretty much all there is to it
they're aluminum base plate and overall
design it kind of looks familiar to the
Radeon pro duo it's not it's a different
solution they didn't really reuse a
whole lot of parts from that card so
this is somewhat new the header on the
efi air-cooled card for the pump is
actually present this header right here
except it's unoccupied
so if you look at a PCB shot that we
took of the air-cooled card there is one
there theoretically you can even solder
one on if you really wanted to but the
real point in that so that's present but
now we know what it's used for PWM plus
probably time sensors the bios switch on
this card from what we understand it
from ryan shrouds tweets defaults to i
don't think i have an angle of it
defaults to the it's up here right up
there that switch bios which defaults to
the lower TDP mode so if you buy this
card make sure you're aware of that and
put it into the higher TDP commode
otherwise you bought it for really no
reason and I think that gets us through
pretty much everything that's all my
notes I have so that is the Vega
frontier Edition liquid cooled card as
always if you like this type of coverage
you can help us out on patreon.com slash
cameras nexus and then you can go to
games Nexus pot and that's for the

you to our patreon backers who help
out and making this content possible
because really it's a it's a big help at
this point to make sure we have some
extra guaranteed incomes that we can pay

takes a lot of time this one however not
as much as the last one if you're
