net and we're here at CES 2016 with this
video talking about the new intel
prototype for portable virtual reality
specifically the HTC vive and that is
done by way of backpack so it's new
technology all of the CES 2016 content
is brought to you by I by powers revolt
to gaming PC small form factor pc back
to the intel stuff the backpack we've
got some b-roll and photos of it it's
actually just a complete prototype you
can see the tape holding it all together
standard duct tape engineering principle
but the idea is to fully remove the VR
from a remote system or from your usual
desktop and that is done by mounting a
laptop to the backpack in this case an
MSI gt70 to probably a Dominator series
laptop with a 9 ATM and that is then
connected to the the VR solution as
usual through USB and HDMI cabling the
battery there's got to be a battery to
power all of this obviously the laptops
only last about an hour in our testing
for normal gameplay is so to run this
thin it uses a 300 watt battery that is
mounted to the backpack and the battery
plus the laptop does make it a bit heavy
probably the 20 to 30 pound range we
didn't really measure it or way it but
it's a bit heavy so you know maybe some
endurance issues or concerns but it's a
prototype the backpack ultimately allows
two main things in terms of use cases
and one of them is the ability to wander
around a larger space so with these
lighthouses the IR scanners that are
used for the HTC vive you actually
deploy multiple them doesn't have to be
just two that allows you to expand the
environment to larger rooms if you have
a mansion or are a location-based
entertainment solution and in those
scenarios wearing a backpack will allow
you to track farther from well really
you can go anywhere because you're not
tethered to a system where you have a
cord limitation and hdmi cable
degradation stuff like that so that is
one major use case the other one is
pretty simply that the tether is no
longer in the way of your natural
movement when you're turning around
rotating pivoting what
are things where if you've used the vibe
or any other VR solution you'll feel
that cable kind of get stuck every time
we've done a demo we've done it with
some kind of presenter there to help us
and they always will stop us for cable
management and that is something that
this will help avoid so that's the Intel
prototype backpack not a whole lot out
there in terms of if it's going to come
to market at all it's really just a
prototype kind of engineering fun thing
to see if it would work and it did work
we've got some more information on this
in the article in the description below
check that out and I'll see you all next
