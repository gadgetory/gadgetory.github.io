briefly up to the top 10 on several
3dmark world record score charts on
hardware but a couple things there it's
a little bit unfair because of Titan V
and we have a half one we also have a 79
80 exe so looks like costs of money
these days get to the top of the charts
but while it is a little unfair from
that aspect we were still able to get
further than we should have otherwise by
slapping a liquid cooler to a Titan V
and now we have the thermal the voltage
the power and the clock results from
doing this modification this video is
brought to you by the gamers Nexus
anti-static mod mat our mod mat uses a
high quality anti-static surface with a
rubberized finish we also have a custom
paint job on it which includes reference
points and cheat sheets for PCIe eps 12
volt and other power cables along with
quick reference throw paste application
guides a screw sorter for your video
card tear downs and it includes a common
ground point and a grounding strap to
help protect the products you are
working on from electrostatic discharge
preorder your mat now at the link in the
description below we've done a few of
these mods now and the reason they're
cool is because they are literally cool
they're cooler than the air-cooled card
so this thing because it is
inefficiently cooled compared to the
power that it is capable of putting out
is going to perform worse on charts and
just to get everyone up to speed you may
already know this but Nvidia is Boost
3.0 and the way Vega works with its own
boost version they both have a clock
dependency on thermals and then on power
and voltage we can solve for one of
those things exceptionally easily we can
remove the cooler and put a better one
on it in our initial coverage of the
Titan B we actually tested this card
stock versus this card stock with a 100%
fan speed and saw that it actually did
help quite a bit unfortunately at 100%
fan speed because the Titan V is quite
powerful we were still bumping up
against the 83 to 84 Celsius wall before
it starts to limit its clock Headroom if
you talk to Nvidia they will
specifically note that
is not called throttling because by
their definition of the term it is not
throttling and instead it is a
limitation of how far boost will allow
you to go now for ease of terminology I
am going to call that throttling because
if it's not performing to its maximum
potential it's just sort of easier to
call it that they do have a point but I
think I have a point too so in order to
get past this first wall we put a liquid
cooler on it next while it's power and
for that one you can't do much other
than short the shunts which we are doing
in a separate video and you'll see more
about that soon and that only helps so
far as well so what we can do here today
is taps the thermal difference test the
frequency stability that's a big one and
then the scoring difference is in
addition to this we can probe various
points on the back of the card which
I'll show you later to determine the
actual input voltages to V Corps and V
HBM as opposed to what a softer reading
might tell you which is often at least
slightly inaccurate typically on videos
locked to around one point zero nine
three volts we with this mod have been
able to go beyond that because we're not
thermal throttling and it has some extra
Headroom shunt modding theoretically
might help a bit as well but that's more
of a current difference than anything so
let's go through the numbers the the big
thing here is that it does objectively
help the liquid cool these cars we've
shown that now for several and video
devices and and E devices including Vega
Frontier Edition where interestingly we
showed that you can reduce power leakage
by improving the cooling efficiency
doing that with this card it's the same
thing by reducing the the temperature of
the dye and the surrounding components
like the HBM dyes we are also reducing
power leakage with CPUs as an easy
example every 10 degree drop in CPU
temperature it gets you about 4 percent
less power consumption by way of
reducing power leakage similar idea
applies here which means that with GPUs
you can then take that extra overhead
that you've reduced from leakage and put
it back into the core as more
efficiently utilized power to drive the
core clock higher let's start out with a
frequency
Alyce's of the core for the Titan V for
this chart we're looking at how
additional thermal Headroom gives us
better boost clocks and sustains them
for longer under heavier loads this is
over a period of roughly 25 minutes for
a fire strike ultra burnin where we
freeze-frame on an intensive scene we
haven't applied any overclocks here
these are stock settings aside from the
cooler on the hybrid the air-cooled card
starts off with the clock of about 1810
megahertz and rapidly drops down to a
range of 1600 to 1700 megahertz dictated
by thermals you'll notice that the GPU
temperature sits steady at 83 to 84
degrees Celsius which is the point at
which boost 3.0 encounters a thermal
barrier updating charts to show the
hybrid you'll notice immediately that we
have a higher boost frequency which is
what we want is also a direct result of
the improved cooling solution we're at
around 46 degrees for our GPU core
temperature now as opposed to 86 degrees
and we're plotting around 1800 megahertz
for the core clock the air quotes card
average closer to 1700 megahertz so
that's a big uplift for Jessie cooler
swap we're already at plus 100 megahertz
and would be an even bigger gap if we
had pushed below 40 C which we could do
with a lower ambient temperature to
illustrate how this comes into play and
briefer synthetic tests this chart shows
a frequency over time during a loop
scripted 3dmark fire strike and time spy
suite both tests have a 200 megahertz
core and HBM to offset applied we even
gave the air-cooled card some help
primarily by setting its blower fans
100% speeds or about 60 DB of noise far
more than the liquid cooled device the
difference is again that the liquid
cooled card manages to consistently sit
at or above 2000 megahertz frequently
hitting 2032 megahertz peak and the air
cooled card meanwhile has harder
drop-offs throughout the longer test we
see this more toward the last few spikes
and it tends to sit about 100 megahertz
behind the liquid cooled hybrid card and
again that's with its fan at 100% speed
so it is both obnoxious and maxed out if
we look at some results of the card with
its fans and clocks restored to complete
auto including the fan speed that's a
bit too low by default we see
even bigger performance wins the
frequency fall-off as testing goes on is
more noticeable and we start to lose
clocks to the tune of a few hundred
megahertz and worst case scenarios
liquid coolant is removing that thermal
barrier completely and instead of
putting us up against power barriers
speaking of power let's look at a
voltage change this is measured by
probing the capacitors on the back of
the card for vcore and the probe points
for VH BM
this tells us the actual input voltage
for the GPU rather than some inaccurate
software measurement we saw a pretty big
swing and voltage range after applying
the hybrid mod removing the thermal cap
meant that the card would permit itself
to draw more power and use more voltage
which we see reflected in this table of
minimum and maximum measured voltages
stock and with air we saw a range of
0.75 volts to 1.09 3 volts the long
known max for nvidia cards default and
under stock conditions
HBM voltage sat at around 1.4 3 4 volts
overclocking and over powering the
air-cooled card got it to 0.98 volts
average and that's lower than the
previous one point zero nine three
maximum this is again because we were
bumping hard into the thermal
limitations causing the card to throttle
back
HBM voltage was a bit higher by nature
of giving more power to the HP m and
also because the HBM wasn't under as
much duress as the core HB m2 has low
heat flux and it can deal with the heat
better than the GPU core can our hybrid
mod with stock clocks sat at one point
zero five to one point one 6v core
higher than the non overclocked air card
and it also ran a VHB M of one point
four four six volts overclocking pushed
us as high as one point one seven with
one point zero seven volts as the
bottom-line v HB M ran at one point for
five to one point four six in this
scenario the extra voltage is a major
help and explains why clock stability is
so much better when removing the thermal
throttle as for scores we saw
improvements in fire strike ultra as
listed here highlighting first the full
stock air-cooled card we scored 77 48
points for graphics and with the stock
clocked hybrid card we scored 81
49 that's already an increase of 5.2
percent which is remarkable considering
we have only changed the cooler thus far
overclocked on the air-cooled card we
were at 88 35 points with 100% fan
speeds or 92 65 on the hybrid mod that
brings us another 4.9 percent ahead of
the air-cooled overclocked fire strike
Xtreme is similar and shows nearly 5%
gains from the stock Titan v2 the stock
hybrid card with 4% gains from the
overclocked air card and overclocked
hybrid card Sniper Elite 4 gives us a
real-world example and shows the stock
hybrid at 125 FPS average versus 115 FPS
average on the air-cooled card that's a
gain of eight point one percent somewhat
remarkably and is a testament to how
sensitive Sniper Elite is to frequency
stability the overclocked card push is
only marginally past where the
air-cooled overclock sat and that's
partially because we began bumping into
CP limitations and just as a quick demo
if you want to check the voltage on your
own card for Nvidia at leat well for any
of them but what we do is we take a
multimeter and then you can stick the
ground into the ground on a molex
connector so this is our GN mod mat to
plug that here which you can get it
stored I Kara's axis Donette slash mod
mat with a real molex can actually you'd
ground there so you just stick it into
the molex cable and let it sit and then
you take the other one and you can check
any of the vcore capacitors on the back
of the card so we can really we can just
check let's see what's a good one here
we just check this one if we wanted to
and you just tap that metal contact
point on the side that'll give you a V
core reading you could also check the
HBM voltage and that would be done by
using the HBM contact points over here
so you just tap this one right here and
then you keep this in the molex cable on
your power supply and that would give
you V HBM so that's how you read those
in case you're curious basically contact
point on one of these
and then VHB em you would get over here
so that's the hybrid mod once again
we've learned that improving the coolant
solution has a big impact on how well
invidious cards do they have the clock
Headroom there they can even tap into it
it's just a matter of whether or not the
card permits itself to under the
guidance of its restrictions of thermals
power and voltage so with a liquid core
we've resolved part of that problem
we're going to try a shunt mod next and
see if shorting the shunts with liquid
metal will allow us to trick the card
into thinking it's drawing less current
than it is because if you short the
shunts theoretically it should throw the
thing off a bit because the card assumes
that those shunts are always 5 milliamps
why would it be anything less we short
them and change that it's still assuming
5 milli ohms but we might be drawing
more current as a result of that
assumption so hopefully we can get a bit
further with it maybe not much but
you're not really looking at increased
overclocks here you're looking at better
clock stability which is what it's all
about when you're trying to improve your
low frame time 99 99.9% title
performance what we call 1% in point one
percent lows or when you're trying to
include or improve rather your fire
strike scores for things like Hardware
BOTS so that's the mod if you are
