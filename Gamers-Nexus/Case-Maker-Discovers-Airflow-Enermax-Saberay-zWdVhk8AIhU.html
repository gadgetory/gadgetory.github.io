now at CES 2018 looking at actually a
case that was showcased last year but
it's had a lot of overhauls revisions
and it's finally coming to market this
year and one of the revisions addresses
a lot of the immediate concerns that I
had so I'll be showing that off as we go
through the case before that this
coverage is brought to you by
Thermaltake and the flow liquid cooler
the flow is a 360 millimetre radiator
with three ring RGB LED fans you can
program the fans our custom lighting
through software and then of course
benefit from the larger radiator size in
cooling performance learn more at the
link in the description below this is
the saber a enter max also has a couple
of other new products and the liquid
cooling division that we'll be looking
at in a moment the savoury though so in
the bureau you'll see mostly the acrylic
front and I know what you all are
thinking it's what I was thinking when
we reviewed every case that came out in
2017 and that's how does it breathe how
do you get air through literal glass or
acrylic so they thankfully do actually
have the front panel that can pop out so
you can push on the front and it'll pop
out and then the plan is what they tell
me say brace should be shipping with two
mesh panels as found on the top of the
case so there's a mesh panel up here
that you can pop out like this it's the
same exact size and mounting mechanism
as the front panel which means that you
could swap them so you put the glass on
the top if you don't have a top
exhauster radiator and side chute but we
found that that sometimes improves
cooling performance if you don't have
any top fans because it streamlines the
air flow but either way you can do glass
on the top and get mesh in the front so
we can actually breathe it's actually a
metal mesh with just a honeycomb plastic
behind it so this is looking good and if
you prefer both to be meshed the plan is
to ship the case with two mesh options
so very happy to see that that has been
the biggest concern for cases for the
last year now so that's that's good
that's probably the thing that has made
me the happiest so far the show so that
people are listening for fans it comes
with three front intakes that are going
to be the RGB I think they call them TB
RGB fans they're all 120s I think the
plant is also to ship
with a 120 non RGB exhaust fan the
reason I'm saying I think in front of
all this is because it's still
technically in development it's towards
the end of the cycle should be coming
out in first quarter or end of first
quarter of this year though some small
changes could be made but the tooling is
basically done at this point other
changes from last year the lights last
year I think we're single-color fixed
now they are RGB of course and they can
synchronize with motherboards so there's
a button on the top that synchronizes it
with the gigabyte board for example and
that's really all it does other than
that you can manually control them if
you want to toggle between another thing
that any of you who have watched our
case reviews would probably be thinking
is there are two fans internally pushing
that way into a glass wall where does
the air go so that's also something I
asked and the glass panel on the
backside it sounds like there is going
to be an option to buy the case with a
steel panel on the back steel doesn't
breathe any better than glass but
they're going to punch honeycomb mesh
into it so hopefully if the honeycomb
lines up behind the fans which it should
then those will actually push the air
somewhere other than recirculate into
the case that's also good news pretty
pretty ready to see case manufacturers
doing stuff where the cases can actually
breathe now so again pretty happy to see
that that's most the case though it does
radiators pretty much are you can do it
I think of 360 on the top is the plan
you can do a radio in the front it's got
a cutout on the top of the power supply
shroud to accommodate larger radiators
which is also a good thing and then I
mean aside from that lots of fan options
there's a five and a quarter bay that's
pretty rare these days
two hard drives in the bottom and two
SSDs on the backside if for your storage
options and that is everything got it
okay so that's that's the case inside
the case there's a lick tech two cooler
so we talked about these a lot with the
lick tech 2tr for the thread Ripper
version of the cooler it actually has
been a leader in our benchmarks for
thermals and noise normalized
performance where we normalized 440 DBA
so they brought that to Intel platforms
now not just tr4 I think there's going
to be support for AM for
well and it's the same exact pump so
it's obviously much smaller it's not
thread Ripper coal plate smaller but as
I understand it the impeller in there
the the fat metal impeller that's pretty
high-quality one and the tr4 unit should
be the same in these smaller versions of
the cooler so we'll be looking at that
when it comes time to I think it's got
some kind of LED synchronization or
something as well
that it syncs with the motherboard and
everything else clearly so that's the
the main cooler there's another one the
fusion so they have a it's it's sort of
interesting the pump on that one is
actually located sort of branching off
of the tubes it's not located on I mean
the block the CPU where you would
typically find them other than in cases
where you're skirting around a tech
patents that are being challenged
actively but the pump block for that one
or well I should say the CPU block since
there's no pump in it has a flow
indicator in it so if you're paranoid
about the pump not working anymore you
can look at the flow indicator the pump
itself spins at 500 to 2,000 rpm and the
cooler I think comes with the same TV
RGB fans as on this it sounds like
they're aiming for 240 and 360 for now
for radiator sizes
speaking of they are aluminum radiators
not copper the cold plate is copper but
it's nickel plated and I mean that
basically wraps up the entire cooler so
for prices case first quarter about $160
one of the two coolers is gonna be $120
the this one I actually don't like the
or no the fusion will be $120 and the
lick tech is going to be probably about
$10 off of the tr4 I don't have an exact
number but that's what they've told me
so yeah that's the under max booth at
