we're getting down to the wire the last
probably handful of videos we'll be
shooting here before moving over to the
office for shooting and this one we've
got some good questions including one
asking out when a trip LTT two who might
happen so we talking about that today
and as always leave your questions in
the comment section below and we'll try
to get to them for next week we also
have a patreon bonus episodes that we're
shooting three today two will go live on
the main channel third one on
patreon.com slash gamers Nexus if you
want a bonus ask GN episode before that
this video is brought to you by NZXT is
new h 500 case which we recently found
to have an impressively effective
cooling setup that is entirely negative
pressure when stock the H 500 is the
successor of the s 340 and s 340 a lead
offering high build quality that's all
steel and glass and kale management
features that are also a top class for
the $70 compact mid tower case H 500 is
a part of NZXT Zanu H series lineup
which also features options from Mini
ITX
micro ATX and full ATX builds learn more
at the link in the description below so
the quick update before beginning this
one as usual we saw have mod mats in
stock getting a little low now probably
gonna be placing another order pretty
soon but if you want one place your
order because we typically have about a
month hold time while we wait for
production once they run out so we still
have them now they're on stored at
Garren's nexus net as are the restock
shirts and most designs and we have the
video card Anatomy poster there as well
so let's go to the first question first
one is from budget gaming PC who asked
any news on the hashtag rip LTT
challenge or ice he said hashtag rip llt
but really it's all the same at this
point so I spoke to them about that LT
AK seems like a good opportunity went up
to Alex who's on minuses team and is the
one who originally did the overclock
that we beat so alex is the one who was
really the Challenger and the challenge
e in this scenario and one up to heaven
as are you guys you guys gonna respond
or like you know what's going on so they
they actually do have some responses
planned but I don't know
it'll happen so we'll see I did talk to
Alex a bit about it
it sounds like it'll be a lot of fun if
he can do what he wants to do it's just
a matter of making sure the timelines
work with all the launchers coming up
like thread referred to for example so
everyone's got a lot going on with that
and other CPU tests things like that
going on
so we'll see it seems like they have a
rough idea and desire to respond they
just haven't prioritized it yet so if
you want to encourage Alex to work on
there rip LT or the RIP GN I guess
response then I think you just probably
tweet at Alex a great ish I think that's
his Twitter handle and let him know
you're interested all right so next why
I definitely want to do a repel tt-to
but it's not that much fun if I'm just
one up in myself so next one is from
Zeno nuke who says ask GN any update on
the limited edition foil shirts can't
remember if a timeline was given yes so
those were pre-orders the update is that
we have just we're in production so
they're gonna be shipping to us soon and
we'll be shipping out to all of you so I
don't have a hard time line but they're
in production now won't take too long to
make them and they'll be going out soon
if anyone has questions on that by the
way email support at gamers Nexus net
that's what the support accounts there
for and he can help out further next one
is from m3 ll0 who says I know you can't
address every question so I'm going to
repeat my last one I was wondering how
different workloads on GPUs can cause
different power consumption and
temperatures all of them while showing
100% usage for example my overclocked
arts 480 super position pulls about 170
watts according to GP z while fer mark
just gets about 150 watts on CPUs ik
clearly is related to the instruction
set like a vxf MA or there are also
different instruction sets on GP 3d
loads so similar ideas as far as
temperatures temperatures more or less
correspond with power consumption but
there's one instance here that's a bit
different with GPUs GPU temperature can
be influenced by a whole lot of things
since the there's so much variance
between the actual cards that are made
so the vr m as an example on GPUs
whether it's a good or a bad one will
heavily dictate thermals in general
including on the GPU because the vr i'm
surrounds the GPU it also dictates
efficient
see for the just for 12-volt power as
far as what causes the power consumption
differences instruction set matters but
also things like memory consumption so
how memory intensive an application or a
task is will impact how much power is
being used because each of those memory
modules takes couple watts or more
depending on what it is if it's h BM or
GG gr 5 or whatever so each of those
modules takes power HP m a bit less per
gigabyte than gddr5 anyway and if it's
memory intensive then you've got that
consideration if it's not memory intense
if you have to figure out where's
where's the load coming from typically
it's the core but there are power virus
scenarios as well so fir mark would be a
great example of power virus where the
clock rates are actually much much lower
than what the card can achieve so you
might see like thirteen hundred
megahertz in seven mm infer mark but
it's still burning really hot and that's
because it's it effectively behaves like
a power virus the literal power virus
says in a malware that would drive power
consumption to just try a component so
that's that's the idea fir marks a
pretty abusive program it's good for
stress testing in some ways not
recommended all the time but it's fine
but the point is that that particular
application really strains the VRMs and
so all of your heat production is coming
off the VRMs on that with some core and
depend on other benchmarks you may have
memory bandwidth intensive stuff you may
have memory capacity intensive tests
texture filtrations and other things so
if you're working with a lot of like raw
unfiltered textures or if you're working
with textures that are high resolution
not that compressible things like that
then you get a lot of memory thrashing
and that increases your power
consumption on the memory where you
might have less on the core if the core
sitting around idle waiting for the
memory to get kicked into gear so
depending on which components waiting on
the other one if any at all then that
can impact power consumption too and
then type of workload of course matters
so it fur marks the best example because
you can compare fur mark versus 3d mark
graphics versus a game and they'll all
have different power consumption despite
being a high percent load
and it's because they're doing different
things for mark abusing the power on the
power delivery on the vrm and games
might be executing to working with
different shaders so when you talk about
driver optimization that's a big thing
is it achieving its the graphics just
via unoptimized brute force methods or
have the drivers been optimized to
leverage different parts of the GPU so
for example asynchronous compute with
something like Volta like the Titan V
async compute those much better on the
Titan V then on Pascal and whether or
not that's leverage depends partially on
the game personally on the drivers
whatever so that's another consideration
too but basically it's it's the type of
instruction coming down the pipe impacts
how much power is being to use just like
a CPU so everything you said about CPU
example if more or less applies here
except we have the consideration of all
the components surrounding the GPU in a
really sort of tight grid so those can
impact the thermals of the GPU too and I
think our sustained frequency is a big
one for how long a frequency is
sustained fixed versus how much it's
allowed to bounce up and down that
impacts it vrm efficiency under certain
loads voltage required to sustain that
frequency versus the particular
instruction being performed so fir mark
again higher voltage typically to
sustain the frequencies and all of those
greatly impact the power consumption fan
speed also impacts power consumption if
you allow it to sit auto then that'll
change your test your output for power
consumption next one is from someone
whose name is listed as a whore or I or
who loses och if there's actually Thomas
is how we know him so Thomas is the
individual I met at LT axe the the sixth
grader who said that he got bored of
Linus started watching us and then said
he got we were no longer in depth enough
for him and he started watching builds
right so he posted another question and
said for the next ask GN could you
explain what BC L K is and does it
require a voltage increase when
overclocking it so BC L K is base clock
as many of you likely know you have to
get a frequency for a processor when you
look in BIOS you'll see the base clock
you'll see them
pliers and then memory also has a
multiplier a couple of other things have
multipliers so those multipliers are
being multiplied against something and
they're being multiplied against BC LK
so you have a 100 BC LK and a 40
multiplier then you have 4000 megahertz
frequency or 4 gigahertz so that's the
basics it is what the multiplier is
multiplied against and then the product
is your frequency and as for what it is
BC LK basically replaced the frontside
bus on Intel so FSB is is gone and as
been replaced with BC okay be CLK links
a lot of things so if you change your BC
LK speeds this is why we would recommend
doing it last typically because you're
pretty likely to introduce more
instability just because b CL k impacts
the PCIe interface speed it impacts the
memory speed so if you change BC LK to
something like 101 and you have memory
at 3,000 3,000 megahertz when it's at
100 you increase it to 101 your memory
will increase a little bit not a whole
lot
you're typically talking like 50
megahertz or something like that depends
on what your memory multiplier is might
be like 20 666 or something like that so
twenty six point six six so those are
some ways B CLK impacts things I it's
basically i/o pulses per second for
stuff like IO devices that are attached
via as PCIe again as an example and then
sometimes BC LK is useful because you
can get half steps with the frequencies
so if you're stable at 5150 but not
fifty two hundred megahertz then BCL K
will let you get 5150 just you might
have to also decrease the memory
frequency if it gets kind of tricky
because if the memory is not a good bin
and the CPU needs another 50 megahertz
or something then you're starting to
suddenly put more strain on the memory
as well so it's not a good bin memory
then now you have to step down your
memory clock to accommodate the extra
whatever megahertz increase from the BCL
K multiplied by the memory multiplier
and suddenly you're doing a whole lot
more tuning to just try and get 50 mega
it's in a lot of cases now there are
instances where you get far more than
that but for a lot of people I think
that's how BC LK is typically used and
it depends on the board partly and
depends on everything else but the board
especially depends on how far you can
push BC okay a lot of the time 101 is
pretty achievable you start pushing like
103 104 is suddenly it's not really that
doable with a lot of tweaking and/or
with a particular set of hardware that
just happens to work well with it and
that's because again you have stuff like
the PCIe bus falling off or memory
having issues with stability so it might
not even be a CPU issue anymore so BC LK
replaces FSB and is basically a it's the
the clock that all the multipliers get
multiplied against and you can get a bit
more frequency out of it as far as
voltage sometimes we've found that
increasing BC LK and decreasing the
multiplier allows us to keep a lower
voltage than just going straight
multiplier and sometimes just going
straight multiplier doesn't even work at
a certain point and you have to do VC LK
so the answer is yes sometimes you can
keep the same voltage and drop your
multiplier but end up with a slightly
higher clock just because of how the
math works out next one
NNN SSS says how exactly do video card
driver updates improve performance on
games over time especially considering
the fact that hardware stays exactly the
same
what kind of instructions are added or
amended to peace FPS or improve
stability so this is a great question I
have an answer on this but I'm going to
expand on it so the reason I bring it up
here is just to let you know like we
talked about with the 10 nanometer
question that videos done should be live
by the time this one's live we're gonna
push this off to an expert actually
driver developers at Nvidia and
hopefully I get AMD 2 comments as well
and if we can then we can get people who
actually do driver development or manage
it in the very least and and talk about
what they do and probably have medium
depth I don't think they're gonna go too
deep on it but they'll give us they'll
give you more than I can from a
technical perspective so I want to push
that question off the experts hopefully
we get an answer for the next either if
not next weeks then
maybe the one after that it just depends
on timing for everybody next one Swift
says do your motherboards that matter
anymore back in the day if you had a
budget motherboard and an expensive one
your performance would differ but is
that the same with today's motherboards
example budget be through 50 board vs.
high-end X 370 board so yes they matter
a lot there's the issue of the vrm it
was the issue of overclocking at all on
Intel so Intel locks down their non Z
board so if you're playing on
overclocking then obviously you just
can't so that's that's pretty easily
answered there if we assume you're not
overclocking or you're using AMD where
you can overclock on beat 350 and X 370
you have a vrm concern so there's an
issue of the motherboard vendor cheap
out on the VRM on their lower end board
and so that may constrain you at some
point with your overclock so there's a
huge potential for difference let's say
you have a really good bin CPU on a good
board versus a super cheap board you
might lose a hundred megahertz 200
megahertz off your achievable maximum
clock depending on how good the
motherboards BIOS is but how could the
vrm is the BIOS has probably the biggest
impact on everything these days so a bad
BIOS will limit you severely if it's
really truly bad for the most part the
kind of average to above-average and up
boards for I think the average beginner
overclocker it's not gonna make a huge
difference but you'll start seeing
differences if there's no vrm cooling
there's a bad v around the heatsink and
you're using a case where you don't have
a lot of airflow near the v RM then you
start having issues with potentially v
RM thermal throttling we've demonstrated
it in the past on an asus board that had
no v RM heat sinks you run into like
SPID issues with intel platform s PID on
Intel platform starts coming into play
where you have a protocol between the
CPU and the v RM components how they
talk to each other so MOSFET talking to
a CPU says it's getting too hot
I got a down clock and then you can get
down clock in there so here's another
thing there's more to this than just FPS
a lot of people think of performance as
strictly one number which is frames
second that's a little flawed because
there are other aspects of performance
like power consumption so a motherboard
for actually he plays with power
consumption directly so here's an
example that when we reviewed one of
gigabytes a z2 seventy boards I think
when they first came out we ended up
actually really liking the particular
board later the gaming seventy two
seventy board but when it came out it
had some issues where the auto v core
was just crazy high like it was R was
one point three or something like that
can't remember exactly we had a video in
an article on it but it was something
like one point three volts to sustain
more or less stock and in that scenario
your if your stock you're still going to
get the same frame rate for the most
part as the MSI immediate equivalent
like getting a pro carbon or something
like that you're gonna get the same
frame rate more or less as the Asus
boards but the difference now is you're
chewing through way more power your
temperatures higher so suddenly you have
to run your fans at a higher speed
make sure system louder it means that
you have to and more power there to
means you might have to upgrade your
cooler and in general just kind of
wasteful so and also you'll feel like
you have less overclocking Headroom if
you're not particularly skilled with
overclocking to spot that Auto V core is
blasting through so much power so that
was solved with a BIOS update to be
clear on gigabytes on but this still
happens regularly with motherboards all
the time and there's more to performance
than FPS you could be wasting a lot of
power you could be running hotter than
anywhere you're close to reality should
be for the CPU so seventy seven hundred
K in that instance was something like 90
plus degree Celsius or thereabouts with
the stock settings with Auto V core on
that board whereas any other board that
used a same V core like one point two to
one point two seven or something like
that
those at one point actually one point
one eight to one point two is about what
we found others were running at four
first stock those would be running
significantly cooler so that's a big
consideration to so you have BIOS you
have things like Auto V core you have
other auto voltages you have limitations
or actually the opposite you have sort
of hidden I don't know benefits of MCE
which isn't really beneficial but if a
vendor decided to turn MCE on by default
it would look like the board's performed
better than it does it's a trick that
motherboard vendors play to try and look
different from each other like superior
I'm not presently aware of any better
that I've worked with lately that are
shipping with MCE enabled by default
seems like they've all turned that off
but I haven't worked with every board
I'm sure there's one out there somewhere
but those are some of the things to
consider pyramid quality is a big one to
really sum this up though
the difference is motherboards it is
something you should care about if
you're not going to overclock in a
somewhat serious fashion then you don't
need to stress too much about all the
small details because ultimately there
are a lot of small details and unless
you're really really serious about
overclocking getting like an X 299 dark
as great as it is might not be something
you can appreciate unless you're really
using it and especially on like the
memory front where it's a really strong
motherboard so there are absolutely
differences in boards whether or not
you'll ever see those differences
depends kind of on how observant you are
of things like power thermals
overclocking and things like that there
are instances where boards out of box
will appear faster or slower than the
other a lot of the time it's because of
either something like MCE or they're
kind of cheating or it's because of
something like the BC LK which we talked
about earlier in this video so BC LK on
some boards just as an FYI you'll see it
bounce between like 98.5 and 101 maybe
101.5 depending on which motherboard
you're looking at so it doesn't hold
steady at 100 you will have performance
fluctuation if you ever see like a 5
percent change between two boards and
it's not margin of error that's probably
what it was one probably went down to
99.5 and the other one probably held a
hundred so there are lots of ways
motherboards differentiate themselves
and yes they do matter
next one I'm an e 99 said in your videos
you have suggested better tester for
going the application of silicon between
IHS and substrate after deleting a CPU
one of the points made with other
deleting videos where so it's it's silly
so cone with an e at the end not silicon
where silicon is applied is to leave a
gap to allow for hot gases to escape is
that a non issues and not applying the
silicon means completely closed space
yeah it's not really
issue your biggest concern is not having
an air gap because an air gap will
create these hotspots between the die
and the IHS underside and air is less
than 1 watt per meter Kelvin at 25 °c
and coppers 400 so having any kind of
hot spot between the die and the IHS is
undesirable even if there are other
theoretical benefits like allowing
venting of hot air
in reality what matters most is having
contact and adding silicone adhesive
increases the risk of a gap
significantly and also increases the the
chance that it doesn't settle quite
right a lot of the time when I delete it
and leave the lid loose 100 percent of
the time these days it's fine I can use
it straight away when I deal with it and
try to reseal it like we do for other
use here whereas it normally takes me
two tries with a lot of testing to
really get it the way I like it and
you're always going to be a bit hotter
than if you don't reseal it next one is
from we have two left
Galia says will there ever be a CPU
cooler that comes in one piece with the
IHS so all the ladies to ask bien
you basically said that the fewer layers
there are between the cooler and IHS the
better so why not make a solution that
removes all the layers someone could
delete a CPU and buy a custom cooler for
an already deleted CPU and just put it
on top of the CPU instead the regular
IHS and cooler so you it's if you're not
aware of it there is actually something
called direct eye cooling and it's not
that common so not a lot of people use
it it's more common with the high-end
platforms like X 299 and their Bower
makes a direct eye cooling kit for
example it's it is a a low volume
enthusiast part so now a lot of people
talk about this direct eye cooling is
basically what you're asking about
except instead of attaching the IHS to a
cooler
it's just removing the eye adjust from
the scenario completely and attaching
the die to the cooler via your normal
compound normally thermal paste you
could use liquid metal but at that point
it's not even necessary because direct
eye contact matters more than anything
else so direct die is what you're
talking about and it requires a mod to
the sockets pretty straightforward you
remove the socket and then put a new one
on and as long as the clearance is the
tolerance is
safe from a good kit you're not going to
crack the dye the reason IHS there is
there is to protect the dye from users
installing it cracking the dye stuff
like that so what you're talking out
exists look up direct dye cool and see
if a kid exists for the socket you're
using and maybe give it a shot just be
aware there's there's a bit of risk
follow the instructions very carefully
if it's a good kit then you'll be fine
and I that more or less answers that one
last one is TK 949 who said loved the
video about Andrew Hans audio room
that's the EVGA CEO we did a tour of his
audio room if you are allowed to share
or elaborate how was that video crafted
where did the opportunity come from and
what made you decide to do it anything
else you might be able to share so I
think the as far as how the video was
was crafted it was basically this was I
think at the end of Computex it was in
his one of his apartments or condos in
Taipei and it's a we basically just
talked to him at the EVGA suite I had
heard about the audio room before and we
thought that would be a really cool
video opportunity so I asked him if we
could basically invited ourselves over
and asked if we could check it out and
he was happy to show it cuz I don't
think anyone's done a video on that room
before I'm not an audio expert but
Andrew Hannes sure knew a lot about what
he bought so we were able to just talk
with him and learn about everything in
the room and piece it together based on
what we could what we could learn from
him about the equipment he bought it's
really impressive it's as again someone
who's not an audiophile it certainly
seems like something that everyone
should listen to if you get the chance
because basically it was a super
directional sound I was expecting not
that but it's very specific to where you
are in the room so you kind of do like
five rows back in the middle positioning
and then you can hear the sound sort of
come out in like layers because it is a
layered horn so you've got the tweeter
inside of the horn the horn with the I
mean it goes all the way back I think
3.1 meters and a big coil as the driver
at the end of it and then there's the
subwoofer so it's very interesting as
as where did the opportunity come from
again we heard about it from people in
the industry who'd listen to the room
one of EVGA s employees had mentioned it
to us and so we wanted to record it
because it's its old very cool
technology that works well and you don't
find a lot of that especially in as good
shape as it was there so very
interesting tour to do anything else I
can share on it I guess he's got a he
had a couple of books so he had like a
limited around 1,000 unit book that was
on all the old western electric gear so
I had stuff dating backs like the early
1800s pretty cool stuff and then other
than that I think pretty much what you
saw in the video is mostly what we had
to say so yeah thank you for asking that
was a very interesting tour and he
seemed like he had done a whole lot of
research on the audio equipment so oh
yeah we also got this this plaque from
from Andrew Hahn so this I think came
with one of his western electric audio
pieces that he purchased and I think
when I researched it I'm pretty sure
this is there this was their logo up
until like the 60s I think it was the
30s until the 60s or something like that
so it was made sometime in that time
line and given on based on how it was
made it looks like that's about right
for the era so yeah pretty cool stuff
you haven't seen that video check it out
we had someone email me and they were
mad about my phrasing for a few things
like I guess I referred to the the the
needle on the record player slightly
incorrectly so if that bothers you then
probably don't watch it but otherwise
it's really cool stuff and as always
that leave your questions in the comment
section below if you have questions for
next time thank you for watching go to
stored on cameras nexus net to pick up
at one of our shirts mod matt post or
anything else we've restocked a lot of
things lately we're go to
