ASA Tech I've known Rob for quite a
while he used to be at NZXT yep and now
you do the liquid cooling stuff at his
tech that's correct
so we have an interesting topic those of
you who know Paul from Paul's hardware
recently was talking about liquid cooler
failures and we've talked about it a bit
in the past I wanted to talk to rob and
walk through what are the different
points of failure how frequent or
infrequent is failure what are the root
causes and I think the idea here is
there's generally a stigma in the
industry with PC builders of I'm afraid
to use a liquid cooler a closed-loop
like a cooler yeah because I feel like
there are more points of failure than a
heat sink yeah there's like a gradient
that like if if they're not going to go
custom loop why even take the chance on
anything leak right right we're not even
just leaking but just like failure I'm
you so I want to talk about that before
getting to that this coverage is brought
to you by the EVGA 1080 TI sc2 and
NVIDIA destiny to bundle running up
through September 4th the 1080i sc2
comes with a synchronous fan control for
its dual fans and nine thermal sensors
and again includes destiny to learn more
at the link in the description below so
I don't know how do you want to start
with this one so you know we actually
have a very good record on failure rates
ASA tech as a manufacturer we witnessed
less than a quarter of one percent
failure rate so that's you know a
fraction of 1% and it's actually going
down every month for shipping it's
continually
recent filler rates can happen fit
failures can happen for a lot of
different reasons but uh the majority
tends to be from the loop running at a
outside of the spec temperatures might
be higher than what it's rated for which
could exacerbate and accelerate
permeation relation all right you
covered that a lot you know we we've
done a lot to try to stave off
permeation rates but you know you can
never get perfect sealed
oh yeah permeation open temperature
right and so that's that's the the main
concern is like permeation is idea of
liquid leaving the loop yeah by getting
normally I guess permeating the tubes
obviously yeah and so I was like what
leaves the looky-loos lubrication on
what is it a bearing yeah so the way it
works and you know there's there's all
sorts of dynamics and to what what's
considered a failure you know generally
we would consider a unit to start
failing if it creates noise that's out
of outside of our noise spec that's
usually the first way that you would you
would witness a failure in the process
it's like like the rattling gurgling
yeah that the air bubble noise after
long-term use not not not what you hear
when you get a fresh you can start it up
and it goes through but something that
was working that no longer sounds like
it's working really yeah and you know
this could be delayed by you know making
sure radiators in the correct
orientation having the tubes down down
so you're not pre-processing more air
into the loop but you know a lot of
people think that the the unit's died or
fail in a similar way that a fan or a
hard drive would so you a lot of end
users and even IT administrators in big
data centers they kind of look at
components split up you have your
solid-state components and you
have your rotating moving bearings
convenient components and those would be
your infants or hard drives and they
like to think that it's liquid coolers
as well but we do have like a big thing
going for us that really sets us apart
from from all those and that's really
that we have a solid sealed bearing
design so our bearing we use ceramic
bearings just like every great bearing
product that it exists you know it's not
a cheap cheap out plastic bearing or
anything so you start with a great
bearing you keep it floating in the
propylene glycol water mixture propylene
glycol acts as a lubricant right and
it's completely sealed so not just
storage right yeah temperatures
absolutely 40 C or something absolutely
so you know you're not nothing's
happening it's not being really exposed
to the elements do not you're not having
dust come in you're not having lubricant
come out you're not having any sort of
interaction with the rest of your
environment and this really helps to
extend the lifetimes of our bearings
over say like a fan bear ride or a hard
drive event where you know it's open air
so the biggest threat to the bearing is
gonna be if you lose liquid in the loop
correct right so how do we how do you
lose liquid in the loop generally my
understanding is you have temperature it
depends on the manufacturer of the
product but temperature threshold of
what like 60 Celsius 60 cells is that's
liquid temperature I think there's a
misunderstanding for a lot of people
where it's not 60 C like the temperature
of your CPU correct it's the temperature
of the liquid and to give perspective on
this in our i7k B Lake coverage we had
the i7 up to 90 something Celsius and
the liquid was like 32 correct so you've
got a lot of room there if the liquid
temperature starts going up it might be
because of something like the fan on the
radiator dying for example you're not
cooling it anymore
or it might be time to clean out the
radiator right
depending if your job has dust filters
you know dust will act as an insulator
and inhibit the heat transfer all right
so I guess the question there then is on
the liquid side ignoring the fan aspects
don't make the fan a liquid side what
would cause liquid in any loop to gunk
up or to information is mostly in heat
it's heat is really it's hard to talk
about this without trying to sound
overconfident in the product right but
the failures generally come out when
they run out of stuff and the biggest
way that these things go out of spec is
when an end-user wants it to run quieter
than it should be able to or handle a
heat load that that maybe is too great
for that size galoot right and so when
the heat goes into a loop all sorts of
craziness can happen he as everybody
knows from high school chemistry is a
great catalyst
it'll cattle everything it's magic so
you know you have corrosion is not being
it inhibited as well you had which could
build up gases and pressures it could
start to separate the propylene glycol
from the water which means you're not
getting as homogenized a mixture of
fluid which could in turn further create
more corrosion and gas buildup as well
as deforming plastics just because the
temperature is higher are you basically
boiling it off yeah and all throughout
all this you have water permeating
through at a much quicker rate than it
was ever into so that that's 60 C it
sounds kind of innocuous to stay under
it
at the moment you go over it things
things get really bad very quickly you
know and and it's not to say that oh you
want to over 61c dilute the unit's right
you know and and that's part of the
difficulty is
and the products that we certifies we
know 60c is good we've done extensive
testing to ensure that 60c is what will
create a lasting you ride but the 60 why
I've gotten away with I mean three what
are the long-term things where we can't
quite guarantee we've gotten away with
like for example the NZXT Kraken plugs
into a state of power yeah I forget that
sometimes yeah and the thing is like you
notice it pretty quickly because the
system doesn't perform well sure so I
don't know some of those units we still
use I've never had any problems with
that absolutely like in a test
environment we - first of all anything
that those thermal testing never have
that problem because yeah you wanted to
be consistent but if it's just a cooler
that we use to keep the CPU cool we're
not doing thermal testing it's fine
absolutely I don't know maybe if you
like cut it open and pour the liquid
into a measuring cup it's also you know
you know it's generally fine but it's
also you know at what point of its life
have you run it at that you know what
other what are the other hit points that
that product stacked up yeah you know so
yeah so I don't know I think you were
saying why a quarter of a percent was
you're on that right so we're less than
a quarter of a percent I think right now
we're about point zero zero one five so
it's like less than one tip of a percent
it was where we're at right now right
yeah and so you know these things are
pretty reliable and then if you start to
talk about failures it's in terms of a
fear you know not just the fear of
having to deal with an RMA but the fear
of are your components of are at risk
where I using these coolers it's very
very rare for them to be at risk
yeah for a catastrophic failure which
would mean that other components are
affected if there's a blast zone if you
will is very very low the like well the
only reason I would even happen I guess
is two reasons one is a leak
and the other one would be like if the
pump stops moving liquid and your CPU
gets hot yeah
in the latter scenario you have t.j.maxx
that'll shut things down yeah
or it'll just down clock like crazy and
it's not at risk and if it does do it
either of those things you notice
immediately yeah you'll usually I'm not
a plastics expert admittedly but
generally from what I've seen if if you
do hit Tmax
on these CPUs modern CPUs you know the
pump plastics may get deformed but
you're we're not we try to design them
in a way that it's somewhat intelligent
so even if there's plastic deformation
that it's not just like Oh Deb start
point of failure this is where all the
water is gonna leak across we you know
we do everything we can to ensure that
we have the highest quality design
possible yeah
I haven't had any closed loop coolers
leak I don't think from any of the
manufacturers yeah a sec cool it
Coolermaster we've had we've had pumps
fail I think two times one was the sight
on that was on an FX 9000 series CPU and
I think just frankly I think it was like
that that's a much Pat you know that's a
question of who is that fault right
there that's yeah maybe ultimately like
that point of failure it's a 120 CLC
yeah I'm like a 200 plus watt CPU yeah
so you know it's it's just a lot of heat
yeah so it's gonna wear faster I think
one of the other ones we had fail or
fail was because the fan mounted to the
radiator failed and I don't know what
kind of damage happens to the pump and
the cooler yeah but you know it's not
cooling I'm working for the fans oh sure
sure and then it takes a little while to
heat up the right
to get to write so I guess one point we
can make here is I was talking with you
the other day about is with several of
the motherboards now actually issues for
sure you can set thresholds for when the
system shuts down it's like he plugged
the pump I think a lot of people don't
know about this if you plug the pump in
the fan into your headers go into BIOS
check the settings for those headers and
there should be like a minimum duty
cycle warning yeah right we're like if
you hit 200 rpm or less or what a
coordinate system has been Decker dated
so it needs to look into shutting down
or yeah and like reducing clock speed
yeah and now we've got a lot of a i/o
headers to yeah really cool and that's
that's something that the mother of yeah
that's news just kind of yeah
taking up on their own there were always
some compatibility issues with the
motherboards trying to manage the fan
speed but it turns out to be a pump and
running right well also you have issues
there where if they're looking for a fan
speed and they're hitting a pump with an
eight pole motor yeah it's not going to
be accurate the RPMs wrong and you do
some Google foo and you're to find out
your number doesn't match what Google's
number is and you start to panic yeah
yeah cuz it'll say it's like the
Thermaltake Engine 27 is a good example
that's an air cooler with an eight pull
motor
oh really yeah I think I'm pretty sure
it's an eighth Pole and have you plug it
in it'll read 5,000 rpm which like if
that thing's spun at 5,000 rpm you lose
your freaking is yeah like it would take
your hand
definitely it's half of that but that's
just because you know the motherboards
expecting for yeah so yeah I don't know
what are your thoughts in general on
like if we if there are people who are
concerned about as an enthusiast I don't
want to buy the kraken whatever the
corsair whatever
because I'm concerned it'll fail how do
you how do you reconcile that versus an
airport what's your main argument so I
think I have really one of the most
unique backgrounds for this type of
question so I mean you've known me since
I was a NZ economy where I started and
it's kind of seven years into the onion
and yeah you know that's about right but
uh so I started off working at NZXT
where we created the cracking series we
were a customer of ASA tech and I was
the product manager at NZXT to create
the Kraken series and so you know NZXT
that never really made a liquid cooler
before we didn't know what we were
getting to into we didn't know what the
potential difficulties in trying to do
that might be you know what if there
were failures what if their catastrophic
failures and you know really we kind of
just dove in and we created the 140
series of liquid coolers most of the the
product wasn't substantially much more
different than what was out there but it
really there weren't any negative side
effects we broke into the industry we
had a somewhat unique product and we we
didn't see a huge spike in our mas we
didn't see a huge installation issues we
we didn't have any of these potential
GXE briefly happier as fire t40 as well
like so there was some experience in
their correct correct names and so we
were still doing air coolers and then at
a certain point
NZXT decided all right air coolers are
gonna be relegated to a lower end while
we try to elevate liquid coolers to a
higher end but not just a DIY custom
liquid cooling there the goal became how
do we provide the Elite liquid cooling
experience that you could pull out of a
box and stick into your system and so
all throughout that there's always
constant fear you know we did things and
the second generation which was the
automatic pump control which hadn't been
done before which seemed trivial but
when you start playing with fans beads
if you start playing with pump speeds
and you don't know what the liquid
temperature might end up being all
throughout these scenarios
you know you always you go to bed with a
little bit of a gut beer oh yeah because
there's a million possible heart exactly
exactly and can't test for them all and
you know then we made our own firmware
and made our own software at the at the
point cam got created in every every
time every step of the way you're like
really excited to do something new but
you're always afraid of something
happening and largely in part we haven't
seen any major failure so you haven't
heard a lot about like don't buy this
liquid cooler because it's just flat-out
bad right you know as much you know
fortunately ASA tech gets to make most
of the liquid coolers on the market but
you know I'm not afraid to say that as a
whole we haven't really seen a lot of
just like bad eggs yeah and I think
that's been that speaks to the the
bulletproof style of these these designs
the relatively simple there's a little
bit of a magic a little bit of science
fiction to them if you don't quite know
how to break it down and you've done a
really good video detailing of how
really simple it is pretty
straightforward
um yeah and so I think when you get an
appreciation for that we start to
appreciate the design a little bit more
you start to understand its limitations
a little bit more and you're less likely
to to be afraid of these failures and
you know you I've been pretty impressed
I will say so I never had a liquid
cooler before I worked at NZXT and I
didn't have one until NZXT started to
make on
I've been genuinely impressed at at how
robust these designs have been and how
long they've stood the test of time I
know a lot of people still use like old
antics yeah Corsair is like way way back
that's what I was another good topic is
on on time a fact of liquid coolers is
that eventually you'll have to replace
the unit just
sure that they're not impervious to time
oh absolutely and that's that's the
thing too that I know the PC community
especially the DIY building PC community
the same kind of thinking goes into oh I
don't want an integrated battery on my
phone right these are all points of
failures but when you start to break it
down and if you spend $100 on a liquid
cooler that'll get you through five
years and then generally most people
aren't using them for beyond three to
four years
yeah usable life of a system expire yeah
you know it's always nice to think that
you you want to keep all your stuff for
a long time and unless it's a nail ahem
processor you're probably not doing that
so it's it's it comes down to being like
how practical is it and you're getting
really the best performance the best
convenience best reliability with great
warranties now five six year warranties
on these products from brands you you
know and trust and who are improving
their own customer service experiences
every single day I I don't think there's
really any reason out there nowadays to
not do liquid cooling I would say
there's it would be fair for you know
product is for everyone there are
probably people who want a system with a
long life that they when they're done
with it they can shelve it and pull it
out later definitely and if you want to
pull a system out in six or seven years
yeah you probably should have an air
cooler in there unless you're okay with
replaces up it might turn on I might be
okay to get your files off but this is I
I guess the point of like transition
from liquid to air
you can make an argument of if you want
this thing to be accessible seven plus
years whatever sure sure I think the the
discussion era starts to be is all right
are you starting to play in a different
league right you know there's a lot of
stuff where the cutting-edge technology
is really just not meant to be a
lifetime solution oh there's a reason
it's not used in like enterprise exactly
there's an liquid coolant is used in
enterprise to be clear but there's
reason cutting-edge isn't used in that
kind of server I think the best way to
kind of look at it is the time-tested
long-living solution is usually the
first one to come about right that's the
one that people are less afraid of
there's less chance there's less risk no
one's gonna get fired for using it
because you always blame the product cuz
it's been around right exactly exactly
you know you can't visit the blog for a
solution right on guys everybody uses
Ticonderoga so you know when when you do
start to want that that quietness though
when you go to bed when you do want to
pick up that extra 100 to 200 megahertz
usually it's much more than I have and
you've got a warranty and you didn't
have to fill it yourself you don't have
to change the fluid every year and you
don't have to worry about corrosion
inhibitors or any of the stuff and it
comes in all the colors you like has
infinity mirrors and pre-installed
mounting kits it's just it's - it's I
think we've done everything we can to
make it both easy reliable and cutting
edge performance for the end-users and
it's just gonna it's still always gonna
be that little bit of fear with what it
yeah and so you know it takes a level of
comfort and it takes a little a level of
understanding the product yeah I would
say like if someone takes all of your
RMA numbers your your points of failure
analysis and stuff and tries to counter
probably the main counter it's like okay
but quarter of a percent or whatever it
is for the
cooler and then whatever it is for the
fan yeah we get we have combined two
points of failure but I think like at
that point this is personally speaking
at that point you should base to be
plugging the fan and the pump
definitely into a BIOS detected header
that can just tell you if there's a
problem it is you can't do anything
about about the fans really and that's
that's a new type of technology that's
come about they've an inch further
ensure the the performance yeah cool I
don't know I think that's pretty good
that everything like no we use liquid
coolers for most of our test benches
personally I put them in place because
they're easy to set up
we're turned down building every single
day yep and air coolers are great we
still use air coolers too but also I
don't know I have probably six of every
NZXT liquid cooler I have five or six of
the coarser ones actively in use and
we've had maybe two pumps fail or fail
and I what the point of failure was
that's not so bad out of everything
especially considering one of them was
from the fan definitely one was from a
220 watt plus CPU absolutely and you
know the like I said I think the best
thing we could do is just ensure that
you have a steady stream of liquid
cooler that you could keep trying to
kill and hopefully make their way out of
the lab yes most of them survived so far
so yeah that's it for this one I just
want to talk about the ASA Tech's take
on liquid cooling reliability so there
you all have it make well I got it we're
all about reliable thank you rob for
joining thanks Steve yeah we'll see you
all next time
handle a shitload that that maybe is</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
