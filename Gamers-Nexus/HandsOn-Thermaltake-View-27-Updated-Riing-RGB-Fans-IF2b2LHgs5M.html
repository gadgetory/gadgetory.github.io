offices now in Southern California while
we're still here the UCI opening still
coming up it may already be online at
the time of this video but today for now
we're looking at some of the newer
products here at thermal take one of
them is the Vue 27 case and then they've
also got these updated rain RGB LED fans
which I'll talk about next
as an aside we'll talk about this liquid
briefly as well but the case first so
this is kind of a mid tower case it is I
guess the the main point of distinction
is the left side panel so you can see
the side panels actually bowed over the
top so there's no separate top panel you
won't be mounting radiators and things
up here and that's because instead of
that normal steel the top panel thermal
takes gone with an extended acrylic
glass basically so it's an acrylic
window so you can see down from the top
and from the side it has a slight smokey
tint to it but nothing too extreme the
front is a bit more extreme it's kind of
a more blackened tint and that has kind
of a diffuser effect on the RGB LEDs the
case does not include any RGB LEDs it is
a $70 case so it's more affordable it
does include a rear 120 millimeter rain
fan though and that's a red LED fan and
then for the other core features other
than the window there is a I guess the
the thing that I found the most
interesting is the two options for
mounting the video card so you'll see in
our b-roll there is a slot to mount the
video card facing out so it's facing out
the window so you get the faceplate
exposed through the window alternatively
you can mount it in the more standard
sort of horizontal mounting position and
then for shipping I guess if you're
worried about that there is a foam
bumper that goes between the video card
and the acrylic to protect things so
that's one of the main things there is a
PSU shroud as most mid-tower cases seem
to have this year so there's a PSU
shroud in the front of the PSU shroud
and this is a different part of it you
can unscrew a cover that gives us access
for 360 millimeter radiator fitment so
you can put a 360 rat in there if you
remove that top cover if you don't want
one that you leave it there and it's
it's covered up so it's not just a hole
in the shroud backside pretty standard
SSD mounts to the back of the
motherboard tray
all that stuff there's slots up here as
well so that's the case that's the view
27 I don't think it's available today
but it will be shipping within the next
few weeks and then the fans we saw these
at Computex a couple months ago but they
are a little more refined in the south
or aspect of things so the fans
basically you buy a pack of three these
are $90 so that puts them pretty much on
par with the other options out there
like the NZXT air fans which are $30
from one 120-millimeter fan and these
are 120 s as well so about the same
price but these include a controller a
physical controller goes in the system
the controller communicates through USB
to the motherboard directly and then you
can use software to talk to it and the
the part that's relevant here is that
the LED brightness can be controlled
separately so you can see this
brightness tuning here if you've ever
worked with LED fans the main point that
you'll notice is that reducing the speed
also reduces the brightness of the LED
and this allows you to reduce one or the
other so you could increase the speed
max and turn off that lady or vice versa
and that LED brightness won't be
affected by the speed so that's the main
thing with the fans that I wanted to
point out we'll have more information in
the article and then for the the liquid
throwing this is not completely
announced right now I don't think it is
a blatte it's kind of like a vantablack
liquid so it doesn't have that more
purple base normally with the blacks you
get like a purple or a blue base color
to it that's kind of not really super
black but this is much blacker I guess
so if that's what you want it will be
available let's just see 1000 black
opaque coolant it's a thousand
milliliters of it but as always link in
the description below for more
information I'll have some extra
coverage on the fans the software things
like that
thanks for watching I'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
