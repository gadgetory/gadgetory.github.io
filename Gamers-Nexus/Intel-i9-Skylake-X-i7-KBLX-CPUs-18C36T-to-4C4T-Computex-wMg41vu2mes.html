skylake X CPU launches up possibly
because of Verizon and with those
launches that comes a new CPU at the top
end an 18 core 36 thread chip the 79 80
X e we talking about that today along
with a total of eight other enthusiast
desktop CPUs that have been detailed so
far before that this coverage is brought
to you by Corsair and their new t1 race
chair which is a bucket seat style
gaming chair the chair is equipped with
rollerblade wheels and it's probably at
$350 you can learn more at the link in
the description below starting us off
with Intel's marketing materials because
that's all we really have right now for
these CPUs they're marketing that
advertises the new x-series of CPUs
cable ax and Skylark acts as ready for
extreme mega tasking which is presumably
a step down from Giga tasking and a step
up from kill at asking for something
like that they've also said that it's
ready for advanced gaming which is
presumably different from gaming and the
VR readiness the VR of course is still a
major buzzword and it is often attached
to high on products so not a surprise
there however we did test the Intel 7700
K so their own product 7700 something
dollar CPU and r7 1700 both were
effectively perfect for VR there was no
distinguishable difference between them
and gaming we have a whole video on it
that's pretty long goes in depth so
$2,000 CPU probably not necessary for VR
but we'll go through all the stuff
anyway the new CPU scale from 240 ish to
about $2,000 so that's down from the
four thread line up to the 36th redline
the 18 for 36 thread monster at the low
end it's still an i5 and i7 from the KB
Lake line they are KB Lake X with the
new socket LGA 2066 and those CPUs are
basically a refresh over the 7600 K and
7700 K slightly different clocks things
like that
the 70 640 X and 77 40 X are the KB Lake
X CPUs with the rest falling in the
skylake family of architectures all the
CPUs socket into the new LGA 2066 socket
of X 299 boards which hosts 30 HS i/o
lanes maximally supporting 20
or PCIe gen3 lanes note of course that
the chipset support of PCIe is not
beneficial for graphic configurations
outside of x4 set up an SLI demands x8
minimally and pulls its lanes from the
CPU instead of the chipset regardless
this move coincides with what we saw on
Kaiba lake as for the CPU PCIe lanes
moved from 16 on kb lake x parts to 28
Lane and 44 Lane options on skylake X
the CPU to watch for this lineup will be
v 7800 X which is going to compete the
most directly with the rise in r7 line
in price and target use cases so that
would be the one to watch out for the
next one is the 79 60 X and this one's a
bit more expensive but it will compete
probably with where we expect AMD thread
refer to land in terms of price and
performance target is more of the
high-end desktop area the least
interesting of these CPUs so far would
be BKB lake refreshes like the 77 40 X
which is going to be basically a 100
mega Hertz boost to the base clock and
that's really about it other than a new
socket type so that's what we're looking
at right now in terms of the i9 CPU just
this kind of a side note to bring up in
our original eye 9 news video and we
talked about the i9 rumors of CPUs there
were a couple comments that I thought
deserved addressing and those were the
ones that said look this is what
competition looks like Andy has
pressured Intel and to finally creating
a new line of CPUs the i9 CPUs and while
there is competition that is pressuring
Intel and that is certainly a good thing
this is not the result of it because
these CPUs have existed for quite some
time it's not like Rison came out and
install just started pumping out silicon
of a new CPU now they have branded new
CPUs as i9 that's what's new they've
branded something that the silicon
already existed for and they've been
developing for quite a while CPUs take
something like 18 months start to finish
they spend the last six months of their
life in testing validation and silicon
fabrication so these are things that
have existed for a while but their
launch date seems to have been moved up
and then we have the new i9 branding
which is of course noteworthy and
probably somewhat a response to thread
rip
and risin with a spotlight on these CPUs
there's still a lot undocumented we
don't yet know clocks for instance
though we know core count is up there
it'll come down to how high Intel can
clock these higher-end CPUs that are at
the very top end of the list we know the
clocks to the bottom end and outside of
clocks and cores there have also been
changes to the caching system we don't
yet have full details but we can get
into the basics from the very limited
information we have it seems as if Intel
is reducing its last level cache in
favor of larger l1 and l2 caches which
theoretically reduces cache misses and
probes into l3 this should assist in
latency overall which is further aided
by increasing the private cache sizes to
one megabyte per core but beyond this we
can only really speculate Intel makes it
a big point to highlight the range of
uses for the new x-series CPU suggesting
that KB Lake K series CPUs are needed
for 4k or vr gaming leaving the non ksq
CPUs marked as unsupportive of 4k or VR
this is an interesting marching slide
seen as we've benchmarked non-case CPUs
in both VR and 4k and have found them
perfectly adequate what's more
interesting is that oculus and HTC both
specify CPUs as low as I 3s and i-5 as
B&amp;amp;B already something we've also tested
and agree with so it's interesting that
Intel is attempting to sacrifice its own
line here saying that the case qi7 CVS
are needed for VR considering that it is
plainly untrue so as if to find a reason
for these higher end TV is to exist in a
gaming machine where we've kind of
already set the bar saying that the 7700
K is really the top end of what you need
when we did our 1800 X review a
subsequent 1700 reviews to find a reason
for them to exist in gaming machines
Intel has said that you should buy them
for 12 K gaming which as we all know is
a very common use case so there's
pointed out 12 K a triple 4k screen
gaming as the primary target use case of
something like the $2,000 CPU and those
high-end devices and things that you
would need above the case Q of i7s for
when you're playing games that's kind of
what they're looking at just to give you
an idea of where Intel setting their own
bar for gaming performance with these
CPUs they are also well really to kind
of explain their point here the only
reason that makes sense is not because
of the CPUs performance itself that's
kind of
relevant what matters is the land count
and assignment so they're saying with 28
the 44 lanes you can do more video cards
that is absolutely true and yes you
would have more bandwidth for them
however both AMD and NVIDIA have been
kind of dialing back support and
marketing behind multi-gpu set up
especially Nvidia so where Intel is
mentioning triple or quadruple II
supported on these new x-series CPUs the
fact of the matter is that even Nvidia
does not really commit to three or
four-way SLI anymore in fact you have or
at least at one point had to get a
special key to unlock anything beyond
two-way SLI and we all know how SLI
scaling works in games anyway so I kind
of leave a very narrow use case for
these CPUs but one will try to look at
what they make more sense for is
production and until does advertise that
as well
but just like Andy did with 1800 X we
have to call out when a company marks a
CPU as being gaming targeted and it
doesn't need to actually be used for a
gaming machine because you could either
get better performance overall or better
price to performance with a lower end
CPU even from Intel itself so they are
kind of fighting their own reputation
here in the gaming market but in
production it'll be a different story
and to go through a few more specs the
cheapest 44 Lane CPU on offer is the AI
970 900 X which runs a three point three
to four point five gigahertz clock
depending on turbo state with the most
common gaming frequency sitting nearer
to four point three gigahertz
the 7900 X is a ten core twenty thread
CPU with 44 PCIe gen3 lanes
I don't want thousand dollar price tag
so some of these prices overall are
certainly better than intel's previous x
line that's a good thing what we would
have really liked to see though is for
intel to double down where they're good
right now which would be the 77 hard k
which is really still the best for
gaming and then try and compete more
where they're losing ground rapidly that
would be in the i5 territory where we've
already said an hour our five review of
the 1600 x that it really makes a whole
lot more sense to buy something like a
1600 for i-5 level gaming these days
it's just better value right now and
it's really not that far be
hide the i7 is a different story it's
extra for threads do health in the games
where the i5 falls behind and so it does
well where am these struggles a bit more
where we really need to see intel
compete though is that i5 market there's
nothing here for you in that market
right now is on a cable a KX refresh of
the 7600 K and that's not going to do
them a lot of favors and then doubling
down on i7s in the enthusiast 300h
dollar price point rather than going
really hard on the h EDT stuff that said
they'll probably be high performers in a
EDT but they're also high cost a
thousand of two thousand dollars so
that's what we're looking at for today
there will be some pre included CLC
solutions with some of these things that
we'll talk about more in the future as
we learn more from ASA tech who is the
supplier of those CL CS that ship stock
with the higher end devices but we don't
know a whole lot about them now then the
name is TS 13x and it's a 120-millimeter
solution that's about it so that's all
for this until news item as always
