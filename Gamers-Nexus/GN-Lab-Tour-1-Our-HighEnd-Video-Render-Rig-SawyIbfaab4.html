dotnet and today we're looking at one of
our many systems we use for daily
operations here at gamers nexus what
we're looking at right here is our
render rig this is used to render the
video that you're watching right now and
all other videos it also serves our
network attached storage solution and
it's a very high-end gaming machine that
we actually don't use for gaming it just
as all gaming brand parts and it's used
entirely for video rendering and on the
rare occasion that it is used for games
it is to capture gameplay footage at a
very high bit rate so that we can render
it out at a high quality for you guys so
that's normally a 50 or 30 megabits per
second with at least 1080 resolution if
not 1440 or 4k so going over the specs
for this system this is what Keegan
gallic uses he is our in-house video
editor and helps a lot with the film as
well and this has an asus rampage for
motherboard x 79 x 99 and that's board
that i purchased out of pocket for use
for the site and that board has a huge
amount of DRAM timing controls and
things like that that we actually use
because we have three different kits of
ddr3 memory from the kingston hyperx
line the beast memory and they're all
different cast timings and Layton sees
and frequencies which happens because we
test all these things so we don't want
obviously the same kit over and over
from manufacturers if we're testing
different models that they output so
we've got three different versions of
that and that gives us 64 gigabytes of
memory it is generally not ideal to mix
and match memory but using the rampage
for that we bought for the the system
it's actually pretty easy to manipulate
the timings manually and get them all
working together cleanly so right now
what you see in there's 32 gigabytes
we've got another 32 gigabytes on
standby and that is all Kingston memory
and it's all quad channel because x79
the CPU is a 49 60 X the i7 extreme
version from previous generation so
we're not on the 5000 series for this
rig and both those cpus the 49 60 x and
the 59 30k behind the camera were
provided by i buy power from their lab
samples so that's we've gotten here and
then on top of the cpu in here
we're using a liquid cooler because i
have a very slight overclock nothing
crazy but just enough to increase the
render times a bit so we've got an ace
attack 550 LC on there which uses the i
believe this is the copper cold plate
one there's also an aluminum coldplay
one that we tested previously so that's
the liquid cooler that's on here and
it's pretty basic just really enough to
get the job done with a slight overclock
our editing software is accelerated by
cuda and videos architecture their core
architecture so we have a gtx 980 in
here non TI version it's it's it's an
MSI one wasn't sure which one we use so
that's an msi gtx 980 that we have from
testing that actually came out of a
cyber system we reviewed previously and
that's enabled for cuda rendering in
adobe premiere and then all the other
processes get offloaded to memory on the
cpu so that's the basics there for
storage we have two hyperx savage SSDs
which we actually awarded our editors
choice award because they were pretty
high performing and i was generally
impressed by them the savage SSDs are
purely striped they are not mirrored
because we just didn't see a reason to
mirror the OS it really doesn't need
redundancy it's pretty easy to rebuild
so we just have a raid 0 array with SSD
is the 240 gigabytes each that gives us
about 400 to 460 or so of usable space
for the OS and core applications we want
to raid because we wanted to be able to
render out videos very quickly because
storage in this kind of system is your
only bottleneck and then for archival
storage for media archiving and for
actually all of our test data that is
used throughout the two rooms used for
the lab it's all network to be a gigabit
switch and we've got three raid 5 hard
drives the WD Reds at two terabytes in
here so that produces four terabytes of
usable space and then the third one is
used for redundancy basically so these
are mirrored and striped that means that
they give us about 160 to 200 megabytes
per second output when writing to disk
but they're also redundant in case of a
failure finally for the case and power
we've got a be quiet dark power power
supply in here it's I don't know it's
more than a kilowatt which is really
unnecessary
for this build but it's just it's
something we had lying around and it's a
very high power and highly efficient
power supply so that gives us room to
grow and it also has different over
voltage protections surge protections
all of which are very important if we're
working on media and then there's a
power outage or something like that
which they are frequently in this area
so that helps us out with that and then
the case is the mdx th 440 that we
previously reviewed maybe a year ago I
don't know when it came out a year or
two ago whenever it came out we reviewed
this and I think it also won an editor's
choice award so I chose that for the
render rigged so that is the GN render
rig I thought I'd just show it off
because it's really high on hardware and
it's cool and we've really never had a
system this powerful before in-house so
it's it's our most powerful system we've
built to date it's very good at
rendering videos it can do a 20-minute
video in about 20 minutes of render time
which is very fast or if you do color
correction it's about 40 minutes not bad
at all as always if you like our content
check out the patreon page and
definitely subscribe to channel check
out some of our other videos we did to
CPU reviews recently and we've done
innumerable GP reviews so that is all
for this time I will see you all next
