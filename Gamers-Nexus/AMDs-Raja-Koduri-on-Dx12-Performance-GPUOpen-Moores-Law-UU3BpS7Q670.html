AMD's Raja Kaduri and SVP &amp;amp; chief
architect of the Radeon technologies
group in this part of the interview we
talked about GPU open the Boltzmann
initiative which is pretty interesting
for users who interact with CUDA but
might want am the hardware and we also
talked about how software is a major
part of the optimization problem
more so than Hardware these days so
enjoy the interview for part 1 check the
channel we spoke with Raja about shader
intrinsics that's also link to the
description below along with an article
of this interview that contains a large
transcripted portion so I will let you
get to the interview yeah you mentioned
a few moments ago GPU open so let's go
into that cuz I know that's a big topic
later Andy yeah so the the first
question what is book you know so you
know what the you know kind of projected
I would say a few years ago that with
the transition to low-level API right
x12 welcome and opening up the you know
the underlying guts of the GPU through
shader intrinsic Sandahl to get
performance out of a system right to get
for best performance out of the GPU the
best practices you know the best
techniques to you know rendered shadows
you know do lighting you know do draw
trees or whatever right different ways
to do that but what is the best way to
do that that value-add we figured out
that that value add kind of moves into
engines right it's basically in the game
engines and the games themselves have to
figure out kinda they have to do more
heavy lifting of figuring out kind of
what's the most optimal thing to do the
drivers themselves have become very thin
writing I can't kind of you know do
something super special and said the
driver to work around a games and
efficiency Android pedal right and we
used to do that in like dx11 and before
api is where you know when we focus on a
particular game and we find that the
game isn't doing the most efficient
thing for our hardware
we used to have pets you know if we call
those application profiles for the for
each application we said oh you know you
could exactly draw the same thing if you
you know change the you know particular
shader that they have to something else
right so we did kind of like manual
optimization work within the flavors but
with this law or had a pas we can't
actually you know we don't touch
anything right it's just this API
whatever the game passes to us it goes
to the hardware store it's nothing you
know that we do so we said but how do we
you know we have a lot of knowledge in
optimization inside AMD and so do our
competitors right so we said how do we
get all of that knowledge easily
accessible to the game engines and game
developers so he said you know we have
lots of interesting kind of libraries
and tools and all inside AMD let's make
it accessible to everybody let's put it
out in the open so that's why I said you
know can you write and and in white
developers to contribute as well and
kind of build this ecosystem of kind of
you know libraries middleware tools and
all that are completely open that work
on you know not just AMD hardware but
what can other people start where to
write and and and you know the goal is
to kind of make every game and every VR
experience get the best out of the
hardware right and so that was we've
started this portal with that you know
with that kind of vision and goal and
you know we had a huge collection of
libraries and all that we had internally
that we put out and it's it's got you
know good traction and it also became a
good portal for developers to share best
practices to so you know recently we had
you know some nice blogs from some rheya
in there sharing their techniques and
all and and you know most more often
than not they these blogs have links to
source code as well and hey this is how
I did this I did that I think that's
right that's probably an important
discussion point is just this idea that
the GPU does obviously all the hardware
level work but there's a lot going on in
software
yes we're just brute force in visual
effects or volumetric particle effects
or whatever isn't necessarily the best
best yeah yeah so you know software is
more than 50% if not higher portion of
kind of the performance that you see on
a system right so you know the GPUs I
mean you know yeah we have transistors
that kind of wiggle around and do
whatever 500 or flops or something but
it's like you know if they're not you
know proprietary scheduled and
appropriately used by by these software
techniques you know they are wasted
right so that was the intent and also
tools right that making developers
productive in debugging they're either
you know their quality issues or
performance issues what we noticed was
that we just as a collectively as an
industry haven't done a good job of
providing a consistent set of tools
right and and frankly if I'm a developer
right just you know putting a developer
hat I don't want to be learning like you
know one set of tools for Nvidia one set
of tools for AMD another set of tool for
Intel right another set of tools when I
get onto the game console you know what
ends up happening is that they kind of
you know don't use anybody's tools right
you know relying on just kind of you
know printf yeah bugging or like in this
stuff so that's not a good place to get
a few jobs here so so that was one of
our goals with GPU open is that you know
hey let me put out our tools as well
with full source code our entire tool
chain and we want to encourage people to
kind of you know help us get their
stools working on other hardware as well
right now we are not married to our
tools we are actually quite open to
using other people's tools too or you
know some other company wants to
contribute a tool and you know put it
out there and open we'd be more than
happy to kind of pitch in and
you know get those tools working because
I think the opportunity the industry has
right as we make transition to connect
you know this immersive experiences we
are at kind of get the beginning stage
the first year or so of we are where we
are going to be in four years is amazing
but the performance kind of you know if
we just use today's software in today's
hardware the performance we we need to
be able to support a 16 K by 16 K
headset at 120 Hertz is a million times
more info totally kind of you know to
get to a photo really level right and
you're not going to get million times
more with Moore's law right I said kind
of my goal is you know we need to get
there before I'm dead or retired and
we're not going to get there by just
kind of doing what we what we're doing
because the entire software framework
need to change the software developers
the game developers need to be they need
to be a thousand times more productive
than their today for it for them to give
us the million X you know kind of
explain of course hardware will move
forward we'd have better hardware and
all but you know it may be four times
faster in four years rate or may be
eight times faster right you know in
different segments but not million times
faster so but software can make it
million times faster right we've seen
like you know the amount of wasted
computation like frame to frame in a
scene is quite high right but that's you
know but they need different ways of
thinking of generating these pixels
right and there is some fascinating work
going on in kind of both you know we
look at some things but you know game
developer so let me get variety of
things so this whole VR think has
sparked a whole bunch of kind of
fundamental research back on computer
graphics again on you know am i drawing
these things the most efficient way
possible right right now will you see
actually you know frame to frame you're
generating like you know each frame is
so complex and at 60 Hertz and it's
regenerating the frame or and again and
you see what is the difference between
this frame and the next frame hmm these
hundred pixels but that's more but i but
I drew redo the entire
right because that's the way the whole
kind of you know pipe yeah that works
that I guess speaks to just as one of
the easiest examples Delta collar
compression yes on the memory side yes
it's the idea of basically not not
absolutely pulling the number for each
color yes yeah yeah so yeah I mean
that's for memory itself right here so
you know Delta color compression is one
of the techniques you know we we have in
Polaris and alright which it says a ton
of memory and because there's so much
what you call correlation between you
know neighboring pixels or neighboring
Texas right in there so yes so Delta
color compression is one of the
techniques but there are things like
that that I can do or like hardware can
do in its control but imagine the kind
of things that the software can do
because they know the context of their
scene they know what is changing what's
not changing they know what can be
reused what can be reused i I can do
certain things for them but I'll be
guessing right you know they don't need
to guess right you know what's good next
right I would like one of the classic
examples I give is that they know that
you know you see in many games
especially on load and hardware when you
have a big explosion in a scene
everything status right that really
nothing slow down there because just
like massive explosion I say I don't
know that there is an explosion coming
in the hardware but the game developer
knows that there is an explosion right
hardware right to say say they they have
a mechanism to hint me like same in to
hardware or to the drivers I can do the
you know I can boost to the max o'clock
if I have some o'clock Headroom for
example right just for two frames right
or three frames or four frames right
right you know that won't make make me
go beyond my thermal budget or something
because I'm staying within thermal
budget room you know TDP limit so things
like that when the game developers start
thinking in those terms they have more
juice available in hardware then they
get take advantage of here in different
APM states or something like that right
yeah they can you know they they would
go like hey for most of my game I
need to be running it I am sorry I
really need you know because I'm smooth
anyway so don't waste energy don't kind
of or heat the graphics card because
when I need it which is like this
explosion sort of a massive stuff I need
you to be there so not kind of all
subscribed already and running at peak
temperature right that's one example
candy I'm just saying that you know when
developers start thinking you know
performance and there is so much
interesting stuff available right right
a one one topic I think partnered with
GPU open so starting to Scott Watson
about this idea of C reservation mm-hm
so through audio next was the exactly
why he gave where you can reserve some
of the seat is just for this function
yes you speak more about how that works
yes yes yes so you know the interesting
thing about the GCN architecture and I
think even today it it's the only
architecture that's kind of capable of
this that you know the first thing is
the whole notion of the asynchronous
building where you can dispatch a
compute task to the DCN engine and it
can run asynchronously to whatever else
graphics task that's running already
right and it kind of it uses the Cu
resources that are not fully used by the
graphics engine right so it can come in
and it can go out without kind of you
know halting or pausing anything that's
going on now with that kind of in that
class of features we also give the
ability save that task that is coming in
and going out is a real time task like
an audio audio you know it's not very
intensive but it needs to be real-time
it has to happen like and I say you know
I submitted audio job it has to finish
you know within a prescribed number of
milliseconds so we needed an ability for
the engine to say that hey no matter
what for audio you know you can use all
the resources but I need at least once
you always available for audio sure okay
or two or you know the whatever whatever
the task is and so that feature is
architected into our hardware to be able
to do that kind
you know reservation that we are in T's
real-time now if you don't need
real-time you can select the async
compute method you can slide in and
slide out but it's not guaranteed
because if the graphics engine say is
occupying all the see use right which is
rare by the way which is completely rare
where we have the graphics engine
completely all subscribing all see is
what we find is there's always one or
TCU's you can slide in and get work done
and get out but for audio we can take a
risk right because you could have
something very intense like I said this
explosion case for everything and then
you don't want your audio to try 50
milliseconds later exactly right it's
like I have explosion in the audio it's
like you know the fight crackle that you
have right so you don't want that so
that's why we you know have to audio
next uses the concept of CU reservation
right I didn't and the API is flexible
to kind of give developer a control of
you know based on how much load they're
putting you know how many see use you
know to reserve so then what is the
Boltzmann initiative is that what that
is or is this a separate no boatsman
it's a - it's separate it's late
Boltzmann initiator is related to our
GPU compute so you know we had a long
history and the industry has a long
history of kind of Kino the GPU compute
API so it open CL is a standard for
computing and right and then their
proprietary you know initiatives like
CUDA and others now the kind of the holy
grail for GPU computing always that if
you talk to the programmers and the
computing world is that they would like
GPUs to be programmed kind of directly
in all the current tool chain that they
use at C C++ Python for whatever you
know languages they used to kind of you
know do their daily work that that's
really what you know they want to do is
just get kind of you know here and I
have some compute intensive tasks that
can benefit from a GPU I should be just
able to use from my language not kind of
you know then
have to learn some new language like
OpenCL or something like that right so
that was the Holy Grail and that was we
were working towards and as we were
working to to towards that goal what we
discovered was the architecture of you
know
OpenCL and kind of graphics API is
doesn't suit well for supporting you
know all these random languages right
you know and scripting languages and all
we needed a completely different
approach and second most of this kind of
successful language frameworks whether
it's you know poles pythons and they're
all and LLVM has become a big compiler
infrastructure that everybody is using
are all based on open source frameworks
and it is really hard to integrate a
closed for runtime framework like
graphics drivers into all of the stacks
so that was kind of the genesis for our
boltzmann initiated when we said what if
we kind of gonna do a compute stack
which is all the way from top to bottom
including the kernel mode drivers it's
completely open ok
and the way the stack is structured that
these frameworks can integrate right to
any level they choose any level of
abstraction that you some frameworks
want to go all the way to Mission
directly themselves right to the machine
code Boltzmann allows that some
frameworks want to stay one level above
right kind of like you know like a
Vulcan level type of share in a
equivalent abstraction on computer they
give that some frameworks want to go all
the way up to kind of high some
higher-level language like OpenGL or C
C++ extensions or you know some other
libraries that we have sitting on top of
this we allow that so Boltzmann is the
first open compute stack for GPUs right
and it it is one of the key steps we
took in you know my goal of opening up
the GPU let's the GPU was it is a black
box for 20 years now right black box
abstracted by very thick API really
thick runtime so it is a kind of voodoo
magic behind there right so we're trying
to kind of you know get the voodoo magic
out of the GPU
you know software stack and we believe
that you know there is still you do
magic in transistors and how we assemble
them and there is voodoo magic in
connect you know game engines compute
engineers this libraries the middleware
and kind in this experience so you know
the voodoo magic in this kind of middle
driver levels is not actually beneficial
to anybody because it's preventing the
widespread adoption of GPUs right so if
there is it sounds like at least at some
level it
I guess the we work with Adobe Premiere
a lot right in Premiere and these other
tools Maya often have OpenCL
acceleration in CUDA acceleration one of
the things that I was curious about is
is there a way to take CUDA code and
make it work more efficiently on your
hardware I'm glad you asked
so you know one of the elements of for
kind of Boltzmann initiator was you know
a framework in the tool we put in that
again fully open sourced called hip and
what hip does is exactly what you're
asking for it takes CUDA code and you
know from sat on Indy Hardware very
efficiently okay and and we got actually
you know millions and millions of CUDA
code converted over with the tool and
like the rest of the tools that we put
they're completely open-source and it
can support other people's hardware as
well right so yes so you know we you
know we you know we have no religion
against you know enabling couldn't
really on our hardware cool one of the
earlier projects you worked on was DX TC
so looking at the I guess the modern
equivalents are the the ants the that's
that's sort of the ancestor of texture
compression mmm-hmm what do you work
with today to more efficiently process
game graphics we've talked about some of
the stuff shader intrinsics mm-hm
what else is going on within the G yeah
I mean you know now that you remain with
that trust nineteen years ago
oh my god it's yes DX TC was you know
one of the first I'd say kinda keno
standardised compression format and you
know it's still kind of you know
supported in you know almost all
hardware and I think it's even in mobile
rates from you know from phones to big
computers you know compression has
evolved in a since but you know the
fundamental construct for GPU based
texture compression Hardware compression
hasn't you know evolved that much
radically right it kind of improved in
quality you know we got more interesting
data types the compression is supporting
the first you know instantiation of DX
TC was kind of good for you know RGB
texture Maps but then we got like you
know very interesting other data types
like in the normal Maps and you know
like maps and residence maps this chance
a lot like they changed a lot so the
compression I mean we evolved like you
know ATI and AMD as well kind of II
contribute to the evolution of the xtc2
kind of you know the next-generation
formats and other stuff and of course
there are new formats and you know
higher compression rates that are coming
to but I call all of the steps credible
if you know evolutionary right from a
compression standpoint the you know that
evolutionary stuff that the developers
asked for would be connect you know
every developers dream would be hey if
you can sample a texture straight out of
like JPEG or something right right you
know which has you know much higher
compression rates and you didn't get
thousand to one hey you know compression
depending on the continent right so
those are kind of variable rate
compression stuff you know those are I
mean if you are kind of understand you
know hardware Mechanics for compression
and decompression and all you know that
sounds good on paper but you know it
costs kind of you know just the
decompression hardware to go at the rate
at which say the HDD compressor goes
it'll be a chip that's bigger than the
entire GPU just to do kind of you know
big completion right just so you
understand the reason why we don't do it
it's not because you know we don't know
how to do it we can it just kinda cost
you know and are going to like to do
that but I think there is a happier
medium again in collaboration at the
level of course that is in between right
between you know giving you that
benefits of kind of you know JPEG like
compression and the speed of kind of DX
T class algorithms right it's like how
do you kinda you know connect them how
do you marry them in a better way so
that all my assets from you know my
authoring time to my you know your
download time to coming onto the
computer to you know into the GPU memory
if it can stay compressed all the way to
the GPU memory kind of the whole
experience speeds up right you know like
gee you know one thing that I say you
know Hardware got so much faster but man
the game loading time still is the same
from whatever the last 15 years I mean
if you have an SSD or something it's you
know yeah that's a hardware solution to
a software problem right and there but
it's like takes you know loading time is
you know and and with increasingly
attention-deficit population on devices
like this things start instantly I think
games needs to start instantly right and
and so I think there is a happy happy
medium there that you know you will see
I think industry together solving it in
the next kind of you know or next forty
years is that how do we make make this
terabyte Triple A game titles just load
instantly yeah that'd be awesome
yeah I way down the road something like
the SSD is kind of interesting to you
for that I mean that's actually the you
know I'm glad you brought up SSD because
that's that's one of the you know
driving factors even though you know we
have positioned it for first for kind of
professional drivers and others right
you know you can kinda canna see the see
the path there and you know the
usefulness for
you know gaming users send other stuff
do ya peel off lands from the CPU or
whatever there's SSD yeah yeah well lots
of information as hoist we will have a
recap of this in the article linked in
the description below
