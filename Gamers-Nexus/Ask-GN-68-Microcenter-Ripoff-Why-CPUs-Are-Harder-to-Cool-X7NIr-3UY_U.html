through patreon you can leave questions
in the ask GN channel it's been a couple
weeks since we did one of these we were
at CES so there were a lot of questions
logged I've got a good amount of them
here but I probably won't get to all of
them so if I miss you posted again below
before that this video is brought to you

description below I want to start out
though with micro Center and I guess
it's just graphics cards in general but
man micro Center what's going on over
there this is like we're the champions
of PC builders we give you the best
deals and hugely discounted CPUs or
cheap or free motherboards with the
purchase of all these other things and
then I want to come to graphics cards
they're like you know what this is a
this is a trend we can get behind $1500
ASIS 1080i Strix that sounds fair so
before I get into this one the we just
posted that GPU video what do miners or
what do manufacturers think of crypto
miners and that talks about a lot of
elements outside of crypto mining like
memory prices and things like that what
I mentioned in there also is that the
difference between primary and secondary
sellers on Newegg and Amazon means that
you'll see 1500 or $2,000 GPUs but
they're not sold by Amazon and Newegg
they're sold by third-party sellers on
Amazon and Newegg marketplaces so it
kind of looks the same but it's not
there's a gigantic difference when the
cards are in stock they tend to be less
insane than those prices they tend to be
closer to MSRP maybe slightly above you
don't really see the outlandish prices
in the u.s. anywhere with those two
websites except for the third-party
sellers
Micro Center we had a GN team member
visit one in Michigan recently and they
had a 1080i strikes for $1,500 limit one
per household why would you even limit
them at that you're like raking in so
much money let them buy as many as they
want what do you care
you paid way less than that you paid
less than $800 for that card so I don't
it's just it's it's just stupid it's
like trying to appear like you're doing
something to limit the consumption of
the card so you multiply the price by
some factor and then you limit it to one
per household it does not make any sense
you can buy Titan X Peas for cheaper
than 1080 eyes and you should it's
looked like the whole last year or like
don't buy this heightened XP for game by
1080i
well I ideally you don't buy either cuz
they're not good value for right now
unless they're like $800 but if you
really need one today screw the 1080i at
$1500 either go camp at a store not
Micro Center and buy one for a
reasonable price or a buy different card
I guess see a micro center they had GTX
1060 FTW gaming six gigabyte cards let
me just let me just repeat that gtx 1060
what was the price of that $250 or
thereabouts
that card is at this micro Center for
six hundred and thirty dollars limit one
per household because while we're taking
three times the original price of it we
still want to make sure we appear like
we're serving gamers so yeah they have
apparently a BYOD I think it's build
your own discount that one of the G on
patreon members was talking about and I
confirm this online with a couple others
as well so Mike or senator claims that
you can appear in the store you have to
find a manager and they will apparently
give you a better price on the video
cards than what's shown on the shelves
if you buy other components there which
is actually reasonable because if you're
a PC builder you're buying multiple
parts for a PC then yeah okay you're
buying
Pew anyway you know what tells micro
Center you're buying one and hopefully
they give you closer to MSRP for the GPU
that sounds great sounds like they're
being the champions of PC gamers again
we tried that at this Michigan location
and what they told us was let me find
the quote here so regarding the $1500
issues 1080i Strix when we said what
about a discount if you buy multiple
components they said that's what it's
selling for on Newegg and Amazon so I
think I hear mileage may vary depending
on the store and who got the memo and
who didn't either way here's the
difference if a retailer is selling them
at those prices as opposed to a
third-party reseller there's a it's it's
kind of an egregious breach of trust for
the community and the customers you have
that's it's completely outlandish this
is like absurd if it's just it was just
Newegg who has a third party seller
listing a 1080i for $1,500 whatever you
might as well go to ebay and complain
about prices there that are outrageous
too but when it's micro Center directly
that's wholly unacceptable and I think
they should be condemned for it but
hopefully they'll wake up and maybe all
the stores can get the memo on the
build-your-own discount or whatever
they're calling it but yeah that um this
it's pretty see at this point knowing
what it cost to make a GPU and knowing
everything we do from the GPU what do
manufacturers think of miners video go
watch that if you haven't before you
comment but knowing all that stuff and
the cost change the retail prices we're
seeing here whether or not it's micro
centers fault someone in there is
gouging the hell out of everybody and I
would have to say it's probably closer
to the retail side of the chain than not
so definitely very disappointed in micro
center but let's get into some of the
questions so this one is from discord
Billy O'Neill says ask GN regarding the
recent GPU prices video
fitting did any of the manufacturers
with whom you spoke consider using their
position as a board maker to run miners
themselves thanks we actually we joked
about this a bit with a couple people so
I I probably would not be given fully
honest answers if anyone did have a
mining operation in their warehouse so
keep that in mind but depends on who I'm
talking to something we have better
relationships with some of them than
others but I we kind of joked about you
know these cards make so much money once
you guys just mined with them it doesn't
really work that way
there's investors involved and things
like that and so the investors want to
see the product moving off the shelves
that said there was a lot of joking at
CES about actually with with I think at
least two vendors about a you know we
should do is we should give away a
heating unit like just a space heater we
should give them away with an Ethernet
cable tell people to plug it in and let
it mine and then it minds the currency
to the manufacturer and the heating
element was free which was just joke but
actually kind of brilliant an
interesting way so that's that's about
the extent of the question you're asking
I think not really most of the most the
individuals we spoke to at the companies
you have to remember these are
individuals I would say have a tenuous
belief in mining in general so obviously
that's not the company that's the
individual but that should pretty much
answer your question as to what why they
would not do that
next question is Yusuf who said I've
been I've been mining with my gigabyte
1080 water force for almost a year now
on my main rig it still runs perfectly
it's an i/o card I want to bring this
one up to address a to address an
important point that that seems to be
misunderstood failures don't typically
happen like degrading performance you
could it Those matter if it's mine you
can be running fire strike for a year
and your score might be the same
in a year as it is today variants
notwithstanding
so when you see failure depending on the
type of failure it's more likely that it
it to quote a reply to that comment on
YouTube it runs perfectly until it
doesn't which actually makes a lot of
sense because it runs perfectly and then
it stops there's very little indication
of failure in between there the the
typical indications of failure might be
fans dying so you'll see thermal
throttling you'll see clock dropping
stuff like that in an instance of fan
sign yes you will see a decrease in
performance you'll be able to look at
the card identify the failure the fan
and replace it if that's not the point
of failure you have other options like
memory failure from overheating pretty
uncommon or more likely a power
component of some kind
just reach an end-of-life electrolytic
capacitors are a great example of this
where if you have one that's rated for
105 degrees Celsius 5000 hours and it's
running close to that I this is an
instance where with capacitors the
closer and closer you run to its spec it
will have an impact on lifespan whether
or not you ever know depends on what
it's rated for because yeah of course
you're wearing down the life of the
component just by using it but if it's
within spec if it's running pretty cool
you're probably gonna replace the system
or the component before the usable life
of that capacitor expires so not
commonly a problem however if you're
putting it in a high load high-stress
environment with poor cooling which not
the case for a liquid-cooled card but
there could be capacitors in there that
aren't liquid cooled if you have
something in there that starts running
hot say it's getting close to the 100
degree mark which is not unreasonable
for a graphics card as we've shown in
many tests if it's getting near that
mark you run it for 5000 hours so you
know maybe get a couple of years out of
it or something if it's if it's on and
off and not 100% load 24/7 but as you
approach the end of that rating and it's
different for every specific part but as
you approach the end of it is possible
that one of those capacitors pops they
start ballooning so you look at the
capacity
if there's some that are kind of like
bulged out and looks like that are gonna
explode then it might be that the card
is nearing a point of failure and when
it does pop it's probably just gonna
stop working this is something that you
could see with some power stages that
were used on the EVGA ACX cards I guess
two years ago now before they issued the
fix where there was a bad supply of
components from a component supplier to
EVGA and those could blow up under
adverse conditions basically because
there were videos of it with ACX cards
so yeah I think the point here I'm
making is that if you're like well I've
been rendering with or I've been mining
with my GPU for two years and it's fine
why do people talk about parts tine
sample size of one and it you're not
gonna see worse performance it's just
gonna stop working and then then you'll
stop commenting about how great it's
been working so that's not to say you
should be concerned or and you can just
keep thermals in check
see the previous ask GN and we have a
long discussion on thermals in there
everything comes back to heat he is the
catalyst for all failure in computers
for the most part heat and voltage so
yeah I think that pretty much sums up my
points on that one but basically keep it
cool and if you're feeling feeling cocky
because your card hasn't failed it
doesn't mean that you're out of the
woods next one Pike said Pike said this
 has been bugging me to no end if a
1080i puts about 300 watts overclocked
and a nice out an 8700 K puts out less
than that even with our hard overclock
then why can a 1080 TI be cooled with a
120 millimeter cooler but the 8700 K
needs a 240 millimeter plus cooler this
is a great question a lot of this comes
down to two main things die size or
dissipation area and direct contact the
GPU in that instance and before anyone
not familiar with these tests Pike here
is correct you can put a 120 millimeter
CLC on a GPU like a 1080 or something
1080i and you'll be operating at 40 to
50 C
with an ambient of I don't know maybe 20
or so it's actually it works very well
if you put the same cooler on in 8700 k
it's gonna struggle hard it's you're
gonna be nearing the pan your voltage
your you're definitely way higher
temperature than the GPU would be
comparatively so the reason for that
primarily is because of the direct dye
cooling the GPU diet is exposed directly
to the cold plate the CPU has an
integrated heat spreader on top of the
die between which there is thermal
compound and then on top of which
there's thermal compound and you've got
nickel plated copper IHS and between
them so it's got more mediums more media
to transfer through and when you have
more transfer media you're dealing with
just worse and worse transfer of that
energy as you keep pushing through all
those interfaces so that's part of it
we've kind of demonstrated this by
deleting CPUs and using liquid metal
look at any of our liquid metal tests
you can drop here from 8 to 20 degrees
Celsius depending and by adding liquid
metal so that's one component is the the
thermal compound between the IHS and i
is not very good and then the other
component is there is an IHS that adds
to it and then you have the die size a
gtx 1080i has a larger die than a lot of
the CPUs on the market if not most them
and that's more area for the heat to be
distributed through so it's not as
concentrated on just whatever few cores
there are on the die on the intel cpu in
this instance so that's most with those
thermal transfer direct eye contact and
anticipate or die a size and dissipation
area thermal density basically is what
it comes down to no rise in 2000 a new
hope says what's the most important tool
GN uses that you would recommend for
most enthusiasts to have I would say the
most important tool is a software tool
and it's hardware info 64 and everyone
should have it it's very good I
encourage you to go into the options of
it and not just use it out a box as the
options are
pretty powerful you can do a lot with it
it's probably my favorite software
solution for looking at any stats at all
really on the computer not just thermals
but it's got all kinds of sensors for
the high end motherboards that you may
not even know we're in there like vrm
sensors stuff like that it's pretty
sweet to really dig into it other than
that a current clamp would be high up on
my list of must-haves digital multimeter
would be high on my list and I like
keeping around different types of
thermal compound liquid metal things
like that just to just to have in case I
need it and I normally keep like a this
is the good stuff this is the okay stuff
and then if I know a cool is just gonna
be on something for a couple hours or
whatever while I do some unrelated non
cooling focused test I'll put the
cheaper stuff on there so that's kind of
what I like to do in terms of
accumulating tools stuff like
thermocouples not really needed for most
enthusiasts yeah I'd say hardware in 464
current clamps digital multimeters and a
nice toolkit like the iFixit pro tech
toolkit we like that one a lot or their
128 bit kit those will allow you to open
pretty much anything on the market next
one contractor three one six what are
the three biggest or most-wanted areas
of test methodology pieces of equipment
that time and money and practicality
currently prevent you from pursuing I
would say power supply testings up on
that list power supply testings
interesting it's it's requires very
expensive equipment to do it properly
actually monitor testings in here to
I'll get to that in a moment so the
power supply testing short of calling it
an overview opening the box and talking
about the cables there's not a lot you
can do with power supply testing without
buying some good equipment and the
former isn't a review so we don't do it
it's an unboxing so you start looking at
stuff like chroma rigs or what are they
sun moon I think they're called stuff
like that it gets expensive fast and the
problem with power supply reviews is
they don't get a lot of traffic it's not
a highly searched item a pretty small
group of enthusiasts
really care about their power supplies
enough to look up professional reviews
of them as opposed to just check in
aggregate Newegg score so the money that
we can make from a power supply review
is pretty low and if we can even we
probably probably make money on it
up until the cost of the equipment
required is factored in at which point
it may be more or less impossible to
profit on it any time in the foreseeable
future I mean like they're talking more
than a year our high it's pretty bad so
especially considering we have a limited
amount of time that is a fixed resource
I can't create more of it so if my time
can be spent testing other things that
are one I'm more of an expert in - they
are more accessible three they're more
interesting to everybody on the internet
and then four it's just it's the tools
are more accessible then obviously the
time is better spent there like it's
pretty much it's I think everyone can if
you think through the process of why you
would choose to learn how to test for
example fans in depth versus testing
power wise you can see where the cost
difference is to get into it it's not
even just ROI it's can you even afford
the tool to start the testing and a lot
of that stuff the answer's no I gets
really expensive really fast tens of
thousands of dollars so that that's one
thing we're looking at the power supply
testing it may happen but it's not easy
so that's definitely one aspect another
thing I would like to test is monitors
so we talked to the Vesak group and
displayport people at CES and they
showed us some monitor testing to really
do it right you need expensive software
and you need you need a bunch of tools
and calibration tools and maybe
high-speed cameras ideally to
double-check the manufacturer specs and
if you're not testing all of those
things it's not really an objective
review you're leaning a lot on how does
it look and that's I mean it's already
pretty hard to convey through a camera
because the camera might not shoot at
the same quality the monitors putting
out stuff like that so and then the
viewer doesn't have a monitor good
enough to see the quality of the monitor
they're trying to watch your views for
so I really need to object to the
numbers
and we're just not there yet I think
there's one a thermal chamber I would
love to have but that takes a lot of
space and is also expensive even if you
buy an old one so yeah those are the
three key things I think they're all
very expensive wants in the case of
monitors is just a lot of time and then
let's see Soren asks I was recently told
by a teacher that you should never hold
hardware buy copper contact because you
can get oil on them or ESD into them and
destroy the entire piece of hardware
this is true why do nearly all tech
tubers hold hardware such as video cards
and RAM with their fingers on the copper
contacts so a couple things there's two
sides to this one is there it can go
kind of either way the teacher is
correct electrostatic discharge is a
thing that's real it exists and anyone
who says otherwise is an idiot because
it's science like it's very easily
proven so electrostatic discharge is a
thing that happens
now you can shock components I I could
have a charge on me right now if I
didn't just touch this but if I had a
charge and I touch the back plate
chances are if I discharge electricity
into that video cards back plate it'll
probably be fine the same is true for
the shroud or really the heatsink most
things there's a lot of ground plane in
there if you touch the GPU core there
might be a problem or some sensitive SMD
surface mount device on the PCB there
could be a problem and we've I mean 10
years doing this I've killed a lot of
components from an electrostatic
discharge one of our oldest
how do motherboards work videos from
many years ago we probably spent about
an hour filming it and it was it was me
and Patrick Stone spent an hour filming
it handling the same board the whole
time never grounded ourselves on carpet
and it was dead at the end of the shoot
and it worked fine at the start of the
shoot
the only reason that happens is ESD so
it's definitely something that happens
that said there are specific conditions
really kind of required to get an
electrostatic discharge that's fierce
enough to hurt something and
also conditions where you have to touch
the component in the right place because
it's possible that it finds its way out
to ground rather safely and doesn't hurt
anything it's also possible you touch
the exact Ron thin and destroy it so
first let's think of the voltage
requirements in order to feel an
electrostatic discharge or see it like
when you touch a car door it's got to be
thousands of volts to really notice it
as a human so that's pretty high the
components that are most sensitive like
a GP or CPU are used to dealing with
things like one volt by the time it's
all filtered down and gets to them so
you can see why there would be a problem
but again you really have to touch the
exact wrong thing for it to be a problem
as for oils and handling contacts and
things like that it is bad practice to
pick up the card and hold it by the PCIe
slot for example right there
it's another another form of potential
damage that's pretty the oils on your
skin probably aren't going to cause
problems it's possible if you're
somewhere like Taiwan and we've seen
this in person where the humidity is
just insane all the time and you have
like USB ports there's a valid use case
for gold-plated ports and things like
that and a high humidity environment
because of corrosion touching the PCIe
slot isn't gonna cause corrosion unless
you're an alien so the the only real
concern is ESD into the contacts or
something like that
oxidation doesn't isn't really that much
of a concern you know just kind of make
sure you're grounded ideally you don't
touch them pick things up by like the
back plate the shroud the expansion slot
things like that where you're less
likely to cause damage when I retouch in
a bare PCB as possible you could hurt it
that said and we get hands-on with this
stuff constantly
even without grounding throughout the
whole process you just kind of tap it
once and most the time it's fine I have
killed stuff though so it does happen
but yeah I think the reason I'm at
taking it on to answer that is because I
don't want people to think that
it's blown out of proportion in terms of
a there there's like two camps to it
there's ESD isn't real which is stupid
and there's being a hyper paranoid of
destroying anything by touching it which
we also see when I move PCBs around and
tear downs people are like why are you
so hard on the components they're fine
so that just find a middle ground
between those two calves and it'll be
good but yeah let's good question though
see last one is timber meadow who said
still interested to hear about IT
certifications and this is also previous
job experience I guess if I remember
correctly from the question ask GN 66 so
yeah I forgot to answer that one then I
don't have any IT certifications I have
work experience so other than doing this
I long time ago did web development I
did test engineering so worked at Dell
for a while during test engineering and
and validation so job there was
basically whatever components we were
testing we would develop a test plan for
how to break them through reasonable
user means or extreme means attempt to
break the component not like with a
hammer but like three years and then
report those problems to the developers
or the engineers to get them fixed
there was a we did a lot of stuff a lot
of projects going on but yeah I was
mostly developing tests following
through test methods creating test cases
where you have a spreadsheet that's like
step one two three four pass or fail for
all of them we did there's some other
cool like shock and vibe testing
equipment that was in there which is
stuff that you'll see in the industry
where basically a shaking table will
rattle the hell out of laptops and stuff
like that to see at what point does a
component come loose or does stuff break
or lose connectivity I also did
validation testing for CAE software
computer-aided engineering
parametric analyzer software I tested
worked with a signal integrity software
and testing of signal integrity software
to make sure things like dielectric
materials had the right values
insulators have the right properties
attached to them worked on field solver
testing and stuff like that so basically
it's all testing all the previous
experiences it's all testing all of it
so that's it for this one though
